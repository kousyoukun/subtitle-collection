1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,960
（六個月后）

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,760
兩列火車 兩個不同的篇章
- Two trains, two chapters to tell.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,720
一列高速飛馳
One runs hot and fast.

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,900
另一列蹣跚而行
The other lumbers slow...

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,690
那是威爾福德鐵腕掌控下的列車
Cold-cast in Wilford's iron grip...

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,030
一只在兔子身后策劃陰謀的 武裝的烏龜
An armored tortoise plodding after a hare...

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,990
所有人都受同一個人控制
Everyone under a single thumb...

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,370
服務于同一個偏執的目標…
Serving a single obsession...

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,920
奪回被盜的東西 實施他的報復
To retake the pirates and exact his revenge.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,210
我能聞到他們的氣味
I can smell them.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,510
從結冰情況來看
Layton took my engine through here

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,050
大約一個月前 雷頓把我的機車帶到這里來過
about a month ago, judging by the ice buildup.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,220
我們已經緊隨其后了
Practically on their heels.

14
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,020
看到沒 
You see?

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,180
就像雪地里的足跡一樣
Like old footprints in the snow.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,560
工程師 轉到往南去的岔路上
Set switch for the south fork, Engineer.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,070
我們會把它奪回來的 朱庇特 不惜任何代價
We'll get it back, Jupe, whatever it takes.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,780
列車鳴汽笛

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,490
催人眼迷離

20
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,040
男孩女孩們

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,750
鉆進毯子里

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,460
司機伴引擎

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,050
消防員按鈴

24
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,640
睡魔搖燈籠

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
一切都安寧

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,310
一路搖啊晃

27
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,860
沿海灣啟程

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,610
跋涉數千里

29
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,200
開往晨光鎮

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,080
列車途經處

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,620
或許在下雨

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,500
所有小旅客…

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,460
列車里是一個倒退的世界
- Inside, it's a backwards world.

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,750
如今只有一個階級了
Only one class now,

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,840
那就是工人階級
the working class, freezing, stitching,

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,930
縫補修葺 忍凍受罪
fixing, suffering.

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:25,100
跋涉數千里 開往晨光鎮

38
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,900
嘿 這里不是過道 
- Hey, this isn't a pass-through.

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,830
-溫妮佩 -有給頭兒捎的信
- Winnipeg. - Message for the top.

40
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,050
不過 挨凍的人們更會抱作一團
- But frostbitten fingers hold fast.

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,300
在寒冰深處 威爾福德從不涉足的地方
Deep in the iced-over bowels where Wilford never treads...

42
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,890
依然有一絲火花在閃耀
A spark still lives:

43
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,350
那就是抵抗軍
the resistance,

44
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,440
由勇者中的勇者培養并守護著
nurtured and protected by the bravest of the brave.

45
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,740
給頭兒捎的信
- Message for the tippity-top.

46
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,700
派克先生 你沒說暗號
- I didn't hear the password, Mr. Pike.

47
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,990
你是我的二把手 我對你的期望比這要高
I expect more from my second in command.

48
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,580
他們發現了雪國列車的蹤跡
They picked up sign of Snowpiercer.

49
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,710
我們已轉向南面 回到了主軌道上
We turned south, back on the main line.

50
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,420
謝天謝地
Oh, thank God for that.

51
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,470
32天了 這是第一個 證明他們還活著的消息
This is the first proof we've had that they are still alive in 32 days.

52
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,800
他們這樣到處閑轉 一定有他們的原因
They must--they must have their reasons for all this traipsing about.

53
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,060
如果梅蘭妮在列車上的話
I mean, if Melanie's aboard--

54
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,270
這又說不定的
We don't know.

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,440
魯絲 晚上你一個人 待在這下面時 有沒有想過
- You ever think, Ruth, all alone down here at night,

56
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,900
既然當初是雷頓拋下了我們
that since Layton bailed on us in the first place,

57
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,570
他可能永遠都不會回來了 
he might never come back?

58
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,820
沒想過
No, I don't.

59
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,910
你也沒有 否則你不會加入抵抗軍
And neither do you, or you wouldn't be in the resistance.

60
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,450
好了 這些抗生素給裁縫們 她們會需要的
- So antibiotics for the seamstresses. They'll need them,

61
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,750
大家都擠在那個血汗工廠里
all jammed up together in that sweatshop.

62
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,290
這些小小的補給品能讓我們保持理智
It's these little things that will keep us sane, Mr. Pike.

63
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,300
如果我們能讓旅途稍微舒服點 乘客們就能熬過這一關
The passengers can survive all of this if we can ease their journey.

64
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,550
讓他們為雷頓先生的歸來做好準備
And keep them ready for Mr. Layton's return.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,680
威爾福德1023節車廂長的集中營 轟隆前行
- The heart of hope still beats aboard Wilford's rolling gulag,

66
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,980
在車上依然跳動著滿懷希望的心
1,023 cars long.

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,100
好 這里應該不會有軌道污染物了
Okay. Should be clear of track contaminants.

68
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,680
我要開始采集冰樣了
I'm gonna start pulling ice samples.

69
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,440
外面看上去怎么樣 
How's it looking?

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,650
棕櫚樹 金沙灘
- Palm trees, golden sands.

71
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,110
我得去趕朝鮮的海浪
Gotta catch me some North Korean waves.

72
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,440
真不錯 我去拿一下沖浪板 馬上就出去 兄弟
- Nice. I'll grab my board. I'll be right out, bro.

73
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,360
讓他集中精力
- Let him focus.

74
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,700
-我是在幫他保持冷靜 -你是在讓他分心
- I'm keeping him calm. - You're distracting him.

75
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,110
本 你的防護服還能堅持22分鐘 你的心率正常
- Ben, the suit's at 22 minutes. Your heart rate's good.

76
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,740
不用緊張 好嗎 
You steady on, okay?

77
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,870
收到
Copy that.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,170
引擎運轉得好點了嗎 
Engine any happier?

79
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,590
在排放燃料 但還是過熱
- We're venting, but still too hot.

80
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,670
外面的情況如何 
How's it looking?

81
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,140
“零下86攝氏度”
Oh, minus 86.

82
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,140
好吧 虧我們還大老遠跑來這里
Oh, well, I'm sure glad we came all this way.

83
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,020
別把天氣和氣候的概念搞混了
- Well, don't mistake the weather for the climate.

84
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,560
本采集的樣本會顯示氣候的全貌
Ben's samples will show us the full picture.

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,060
我們是在尋找趨勢
We're looking for trends.

86
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,270
我還以為我們是在找宜居的地方
- I thought we were looking for a place to live.

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,690
模型說這里是合適地點 等采樣結果出來再說
The model likes this spot. Let's just wait for the results.

88
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,610
“模型”
Oh, the model.

89
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,950
嘿 提爾 還記得之前 模型說蘇拉威西島很合適嗎 
- Hey, Till, remember how much the model liked Sulawesi?

90
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,570
記得
Yeah, I do.

91
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,530
我們環行世界六個月了 卻沒拿得出手的成績
Six months of going around the world with nothing to show for it.

92
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,370
每一次停留 我們都了解到了新信息
- And we learned something from every stop.

93
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,910
-就把它們當作是數據點嘛 -行 雷頓教授
Think of them as data points.  Okay, Professor Layton.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,830
那些不是冰凍的地獄 而是數據點
- They were not frozen hellscapes. They were data points.

95
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
沒錯
Correct.

96
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,350
糟糕
Shit.

97
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,810
（熱敏開關故障）

98
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,060
-我需要跟他通話 -好
- I need to talk to him. - Okay.

99
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,650
本 主管道上的一個熱敏開關壞了
- Ben, we just blew a thermal switch on the main line.

100
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,020
-準是誤報 -不是的
- It's gotta be an error. - It isn't.

101
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,860
我跟你說過 我們的空燃比太小了
We came in too rich. I told you that.

102
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,360
把多余的燃料排出去就行 艾莉 引擎自己會調整的
- Just discharge the excess, Alex. She'll rebalance.

103
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,200
若再繼續排放燃料 我們就會啟動不了了
If I discharge any more, we won't be able to get going again.

104
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,870
我們必須放棄行動 讓他回來
We have to abort. Pull him in.

105
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,330
別聽她的 雷頓 她能調整好空燃比的
She's wrong, Layton. She can ride the levels.

106
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,460
再給我十分鐘
Ten more minutes.

107
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,130
我們在大量耗費燃料 我們得馬上啟程
- We're burning up. We need to go right now.

108
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,670
盡你所能穩住引擎
Do what you can.

109
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,630
我跟他說了空燃比太小
- I told him we came in too rich.

110
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,220
好吧
Okay.

111
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,010
一切盡在掌握之中
Everything's under control.

112
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,390
本 你繼續完成任務 好嗎 
- Ben, just stay on task. Okay?

113
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,240
嗨
Hey.

114
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,660
她今天早上發過脾氣嗎 
She touchy this morning?

115
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,370
非常尖酸刻薄
- Scathing. So mean.

116
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,620
-賽克斯馬上就到 -很好
- Sykes is on her way. - Great.

117
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,500
我們為什么又停下了 
Why have we stopped again?

118
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,050
他們找不到綠洲的 這你很清楚
You know, they're not gonna find an oasis. - You know that.

119
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,220
我什么都不清楚 這樣更容易些
- I don't know anything. It's easier that way.

120
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,850
跟誰都不熟 什么感覺都沒有 我的囚犯 你是個孤獨的女人
- Ugh, know no one, feel nothing. You're a woman alone, my jailer.

121
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,350
至少我還有你
Well, at least I got you.

122
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,430
你是想規規矩矩地在外面吃呢 還是想在里面吃 
You gonna be civil, or do you want me to feed you in there?

123
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,310
禽獸優先
Monsters first.

124
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,690
-不 請吧 -不要
- No, please. - No.

125
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,980
好了 能選的越來越少 這是今天的選擇
- Okay. Today's dwindling selection.

126
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,320
我們有紅酒燉牛肉
We have the boeuf bourguignon,

127
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,570
培根蛋醬意面、可怕的蘑菇雞肉套餐
the carbonara, the dreaded chicken mushroom bag,

128
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,950
還有最后一份泰式蔬菜
and the last Thai vegetable.

129
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,450
給這些鐵路強盜干活 你好像挺開心
- You seem to enjoy working for these pirates.

130
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,040
奧德麗 我只是個服刑中的戰俘而已
- Just a POW doing my time, Audrey.

131
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,380
你這么配合他們 他會惡心死的
- Well, he'd be disgusted with your cooperation.

132
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,090
能別拌嘴了嗎 
Can you please?

133
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,590
-如果沒人想要泰式蔬菜… -馬汀 給我培根蛋醬意面
- If nobody wants the Thai vegetable... - Just give me the carbonara, Martin.

134
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,800
培根蛋醬意面是最難吃的
Carbonara, it's the worst.

135
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,560
本 風開始大了 看來有冷鋒要來了
- Ben? Ben, the wind's picking up. It looks like there's a front coming in.

136
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,850
收到 我這就回去
- Copy that. I'm on my way back.

137
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,770
艾莉那里情況如何 
- How's Alex?

138
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,770
艾莉 匯報情況
- Alex, status.

139
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,350
引擎沒有著火
We're not actively on fire.

140
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,230
讓他動作快一點
Tell him to hurry.

141
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,480
她說她聽了你的建議 一切運作正常
- She says she took your advice and everything's working out.

142
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,200
這里有很多飄雪
So much blown snow.

143
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,070
有大量的風吹過這片盆地
A lot of wind comes through this basin.

144
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,370
這是好事 對嗎 
- Well, that's good, though, right?

145
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,030
可能是
Could be.

146
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,750
可能是模型測到的暖點引起的
Might be our warm spot stirring things up.

147
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,520
（信號丟失）

148
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,730
-本  -本 
- Ben. - Ben?

149
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,100
-本  -本 收到請回答 本
- Ben. - Ben, come in, Ben.

150
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,310
-我看不到他了 -本 
- I can't see him. - Ben.

151
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,360
本 聽到我說話了沒 本 
- Ben! Ben, do you copy? Ben.

152
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,620
本 聽到沒有 
Ben, come in.

153
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,050
貝絲 有件事我不明白
The bit I don't get, Bess,

154
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,510
等把你們那寶貝氣候模型 帶回給威爾福德之后
when we return to Wilford with your precious climate model,

155
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,430
你們打算怎樣 
what happens then?

156
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,350
談判
Negotiations.

157
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,390
兩列列車都想重新連接
Both trains want to reconnect.

158
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,600
沒錯 先談交換人質的事
- Yeah. Hostage negotiations first.

159
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,940
用你換扎拉
You for Zarah.

160
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,940
行 然后呢 
- Yeah, but then what?

161
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,400
用你們這里的七個人 換威爾福德手里的2700個 
- Wilford's 2,700 to your 7?

162
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,150
對叛徒和偷渡者 他可不會客氣
He's not gonna take too kindly to a traitor and a stowaway.

163
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,200
我怎么成偷渡者了 
How am I a stowaway?

164
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,110
我當時在自己的車廂里打盹 醒來時列車已經不見了
I woke up from a nap in my carriage and the train was gone,

165
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,580
連同我的老公和雙胞胎兒子一起沒了
along with my husband and my twin boys.

166
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,490
我是提爾
Till here.

167
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,370
你得把他們關起來 然后到上面來
- Yeah, I need you to lock them down and get up here.

168
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,710
-出什么事了  -沒什么是他們需要知道的
- What's up? - Nothing they need to know about.

169
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,120
好 我這就去
- All right. On my way.

170
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,960
本 聽到沒有 
Ben, do you read?

171
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,460
好了 午飯結束 馬汀 把她關起來
All right, that's lunch. Martin, lock her up.

172
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,250
-出什么事了嗎  -動起來 快
- Is something wrong? - Move, go.

173
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,470
嘿 我之前看到本出去了 你們需要幫忙嗎 
- Hey, I saw Ben going outside earlier. - Do you need help?

174
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,010
不用 一切都好 我們沒事
- No, everything's good. We're good.

175
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,970
這就去
On it.

176
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,690
提爾 嘿
- Till. Hey,

177
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,520
出什么事了 
what's going on?

178
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,560
你們待在自己的房間里
You stay in your quarters.

179
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,730
等著機車給出故障排除的指示
Wait till the engine gives the all-clear.

180
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,400
-就這樣  -是的
- That's it? - Yep.

181
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,290
-我要出去看看 -你不能去 我去
I'm going out there. - No, you're not. I'm going.

182
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,210
你們倆都不能出去
- Neither of you are going anywhere.

183
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,460
我們不能待在這里 本 
We can't stay here. Ben.

184
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,880
-本 聽到了沒  -我們不能撇下他
Ben, do you copy? We are not leaving him.

185
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,510
雷頓 如果現在不啟動 引擎會燒壞的
- Layton, if we don't get rolling right now, we will melt down.

186
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,840
你需要多少時間 
How long do you need?

187
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,010
八分鐘啟動加速
- 8 minutes to get up to speed,

188
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,300
10到12分鐘運行燃料釋放程序
10 to 12 minutes to run a discharge sequence.

189
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,310
-很好 開始吧 -把你丟在外面嗎 
- Great. Go. - And leave you outside?

190
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,310
搶修員的防護服能維持30分鐘 你啟動列車 然后再回來找我
- The breach suits have 30 minutes. You go, you come back for me.

191
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,650
-你得留下 -聽你的才怪
- You are staying here. - Yeah. Like, hell I am.

192
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,110
沒什么可討論的
It's not a discussion, Josie.

193
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,320
如果我們三個都出了事 就沒人能完成戶外任務了
If all three of us get in trouble out there, there's no one left for off-train work.

194
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,490
我會確保這情況不會發生
- Yeah, well, I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

195
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,910
就這么一次
- You know, one time,

196
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,040
麻煩你改變一下習慣 服從指揮吧
just for a change of pace, you could respect the chain of command.

197
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,290
“服從指揮” 
Chain of command?

198
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,040
雷頓 這不是艘戰艦 而是個救生筏
Layton, this isn't a battleship. It's a bloody life raft.

199
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,210
你得留在筏上
And you're staying on it.

200
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,470
本根本就不該出去
- Ben shouldn't even be out there.

201
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,550
-他知道自己在做什么 -是呀 追逐梅蘭妮的鬼魂
- He knew what he was getting into. - Yeah. Chasing Melanie's ghost.

202
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
是驗證她的理論
Her theory.

203
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,850
我們都說好的
We all agreed.

204
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,680
找到新伊甸園 再回去接大伙兒
We find New Eden, then we go back for the others.

205
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,480
萬一沒有新伊甸園呢 
- And what if there is no New Eden?

206
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,650
萬一她錯了呢 
What if she's wrong?

207
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,360
我們就跟她一起完蛋 
Guess we just all go down with her, eh?

208
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
提爾 你得負責駕駛 把我們帶出這里
- Till, you're gonna have to pilot us out of here.

209
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,320
我 為什么 
- Me? Why?

210
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,030
因為我得處理這個
- Because I need to go deal with that.

211
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
什么 
- What?

212
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,910
老天
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

213
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,000
行 好 交給我了
Yeah, okay. I--I got it.

214
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,510
（勿碰）

215
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,300
（危險）

216
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,770
你那些天花亂墜的話 連自己都開始信了 你知道的吧 
- You're starting to believe your own hype. You do know that, don't you?

217
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,890
我只是在努力讓大家都活下去
- I'm just trying to keep everyone alive.

218
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,980
對 我們知道 你是我們偉大的救世主
Yep. We know. Our great savior.

219
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,940
我從沒這么說過
Never my words.

220
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,570
我從一開始就在末等車廂 臟的臭的我都經歷過
- I was there at the beginning in The Tail, in the muck and the shit.

221
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,190
我知道你的為人
I know who you are.

222
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,110
當初是你鼓勵我當領袖的
- You encouraged me to be a leader.

223
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,150
不是領導這個
- Not for this.

224
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,910
這都不是我想要的
Didn't ask for any of this.

225
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,870
機車 我們在艙門口了 打開安全閘
- Engine, we're at the bay door. Release the safety.

226
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,830
收到
Uh, copy.

227
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,460
艙門安全閘在哪兒 
Bay door safety?

228
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,090
在系統面板的右上角
System panel, top right.

229
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,780
喬西 當心點
Josie, be careful.

230
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,700
嗯
- Yeah.

231
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,950
好 你也是
Yeah, you too.

232
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,880
看到什么了嗎 
You see anything?

233
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,430
他們在另一邊 這里看不到
We're on the wrong side.

234
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,970
我們已經停了很長時間了 不是嗎 
Well, we've been stopped for an awfully long time, haven't we?

235
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,680
-機車 我們已下車了 -好 收到
Engine, we're clear. - Okay. Copy.

236
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,850
他們下車了 
They're clear!

237
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,690
你能啟動 加速到20嗎 
- Okay. Take us up to 20.

238
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,030
悠著點 
- Easy! Easy.

239
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,600
這是總的合并分類帳
- This is the general consolidated ledger.

240
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,860
從中可以看到 司務長是在哪個環節 發現偷竊行為的
And you can see where the quartermaster detected pilfering.

241
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,190
巧妙地分攤到了供應鏈的各個環節
- Cleverly dispersed along the supply chain.

242
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,610
是雷頓的余黨干的
- Laytonites, or what's left of them.

243
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,860
沒錯 有人在扮演羅賓漢呢
- Yeah. Someone's playing Robin Hood.

244
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,290
扎拉 你感覺如何 
Zarah. Zarah. How are you feeling?

245
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,080
-非常龐大 我挺好 謝謝關心 -很好…
Enormous. - I'm fine, thank you. Oh, good.

246
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,380
哈維 我拿到了工程部的報告
- I have the engineering report, Javi.

247
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,420
-給我吧 -我們來聽她說吧
- I'll take that. - Let's hear it from her.

248
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,590
扎拉 我很欣賞你傳遞壞消息的方式
I appreciate how you deliver bad news, Zarah.

249
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,760
你總能保持心明眼亮
Always a clear-eyed view.

250
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,050
那好吧
- So, then,

251
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,810
大部分二等車廂 和部分三等車廂的水管還凍著
your water pipes are still frozen. Most of Second and parts of Third.

252
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,350
農業區的產量又下降了 不過本周只下降了6%
And Ag-Sec output is down again, but only by 6% this week.

253
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,310
這是因為有人盜竊…
- This is pilfering. I was--

254
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,900
昨晚 43個休眠者 以及串連區的供熱完全斷了
- And last night, 43 sleepers and The Chains lost heat completely.

255
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,570
仍有162名乘客處于疏散狀態
162 passengers remain evacuated.

256
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,610
如果我們沒法同時為所有人供暖
- Well, if we can't keep them all warm at once,

257
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,990
那他們就得分批挨凍
they'll just have to be miserable in shifts.

258
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,700
拋棄頭等車廂呀
We'll cut First Class.

259
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,410
不行
Out of the question.

260
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,040
約瑟夫 你已經將其棄置 都空了 又結了冰 拋棄它可以減輕負擔
- Well, you did decommission it, Joseph. It's empty and frozen. - Cut the weight.

261
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,340
等我把機車和奧德麗奪回來之后 就會讓頭等車廂重現輝煌
- I will restore First to glory when I get my engine back-- and Audrey with it.

262
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,720
也許有其他節約能源的方法 比如選擇性宰殺
- Perhaps there's another way to conserve energy. - Like a cull.

263
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,170
不行 凱文 你這個食人魔
- No, Kevin, you ghoul.

264
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,300
請教訓一下他 提醒他這里是有規矩的
- Please berate him. Remind him there are rules.

265
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,720
很抱歉得讓你失望了 凱文
Sorry to disappoint, Kevin.

266
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,060
除了凍斷一兩根手臂 我們要盡可能保證大家活著
But minus an arm or two, we keep everyone as alive as possible

267
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,980
這樣 奧德麗才能活著
so Audrey stays as alive as possible.

268
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,100
-明白 -你也一樣 親愛的
- Of course. - And you too, my dear.

269
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,320
這是答應了的
- That's been guaranteed,

270
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,780
不是嗎 
hasn't it?

271
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,910
再見 哈維
Bye, Javi.

272
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,660
規矩
- Rules.

273
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,250
抵抗軍可沒這么規矩
The resistance is not so constrained.

274
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,420
凱文 所有游戲都有規矩 有點創意嘛
Every game has rules, Kevin. Get creative.

275
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,790
軍靴泰森
Jackboot Tyson.

276
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,630
你到底能不能把我調出堆肥區 
- Can you get me out of compost or not?

277
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,960
再等一周
One more week.

278
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,130
不過 趁等的時候 洗個熱水盆浴怎么樣 
But in the meantime, how about a nice hot bath?

279
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,720
你是在取笑我嗎 
You taking the piss?

280
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,850
沐浴券 獎勵你為抵抗事業作出的貢獻
Bathing token for services to the cause.

281
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,810
凱文 要喝點什么嗎 
- What can we do for you, Kevin?

282
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,230
給我來杯阿華田
Ovaltine.

283
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,400
我們這里沒有阿華田 只有列車自釀的烈酒
Yeah, we don't have Ovaltine. We have train-made hooch.

284
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,240
好吧 來一杯那個酒
- Fine. One hooch.

285
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,030
威爾福德先生很喜歡 你們打理這里的方式
Mr. Wilford loves what you've done with the place,

286
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,040
不過 他需要你們多做一件事
but I'm afraid he needs just a smidge more from the deal.

287
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,620
打聽消息 
Information?

288
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,170
抵抗軍在不停地 各處討好 盜取資源
- The subversives continue filching and currying favor

289
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,590
而他們的首領 則不斷從我們指縫里溜走
while their shot caller keeps slipping through our fingers.

290
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,220
我們現在希望能找出并抓住這個人
We would like this person identified and captured... now.

291
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,350
也許喝醉的那個軍靴知道點內幕
- Maybe our passed-out Jack knows something.

292
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,150
軍靴惠金斯 
Jackboot Whiggins?

293
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,480
嘿 斯圖 
Oi, Stuie.

294
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,320
-惠金斯 醒一醒 -干嗎 
Wake up, Whiggins. - What?

295
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
你說我可以待在這里的
You said I could stay.

296
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,580
-你是負責看守水資源的吧  -嗯 怎么了 
- They put you on Water Security, yeah? Yes.

297
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,540
你以前是頭等車廂的 所以你會樂意幫忙的
- You're a former Firstie, so you'll be glad to help.

298
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,120
水資源的安全出了什么問題 
- Well, what's happening in Water Security?

299
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,880
沒有問題啊
Uh, you know, nothing.

300
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,460
嗯
Yeah.

301
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,720
好吧…
Um, well,

302
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,640
只是很小的問題
you know, very little.

303
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,970
-凱文需要的不多 -只需要一點線索就行
Kevin doesn't need much. - Just a little thread to pick.

304
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,560
說吧
Come on.

305
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,480
好吧 我聽說二等車廂的配水員
- Well, I've heard that the Second Class Watermaster

306
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,230
在給為抵抗軍效力的人…
was giving away hot baths

307
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,110
提供免費熱水盆浴
for service to the resistance.

308
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,280
我們來看看
Let's have a look.

309
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,450
傷口恢復得很不錯
Oh, that's healing nicely.

310
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,250
你今天涂藥膏了嗎 
Have you applied your cream today?

311
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,710
-沒有 先生 -那就讓我來幫你涂吧
- No, sir. - Well, then allow me.

312
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,350
沒事的 乖狗狗 沒事的 躺下
Oh, it's all right, cub. It's all right. You like me now.

313
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,060
朱庇特的事
This business with Jupiter.

314
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,350
哈維爾 我知道 用它對付人的手法很粗暴
I know she's a blunt tool, Javier.

315
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,230
可是 當你一個人 得為近三千人負責時
But when you're one man responsible for nearly 3,000...

316
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,110
光是紀律嚴明是不夠的
It's not enough being a disciplinarian.

317
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,660
我得再用上別的手段才行
You need to add a little chaos to the mix.

318
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,910
在這里 就是朱庇特
In here, it's Jupiter.

319
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,200
在外面 就是凱文 咬牙切齒 橫沖直撞
Out there, it's Kevin, gnashing his teeth and running amok.

320
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,580
哈維爾 你無法與不可預測的事情作對
You can't fight the unpredictable, Javier.

321
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,380
這就是我確保大家安全的方法
That's how I keep everyone safe.

322
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,960
總之
Anyway...

323
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,590
我希望你能看清問題的本質
I hope you see it for what it is.

324
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,300
我確實很需要你 哈維爾
I do need you, Javier.

325
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,690
好小伙子
Good man.

326
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,940
我是威爾福德
Wilford.

327
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,950
先生 我們有線索了
Sir, we have a lead.

328
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,470
配水員阿諾多雷耶斯
Watermaster Arnoldo Reyas.

329
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,980
永恒機車永不停歇
- Sí, señor. The Engine will provide.

330
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,190
清新如洗
Clean as a baby.

331
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
來吧
Come on.

332
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,080
出來吧 別著涼了
Come on out before you get cold.

333
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,170
配水員把我們的位置告訴了他們
- The Watermaster told them where we are.

334
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,170
-得換地方了 -又要換 
- Gotta go. - Again.

335
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,020
-好了嗎  -好了
- Okay. - Okay.

336
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,310
-來吧 -來了
- Come on. - I'm coming.

337
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,440
這就對了 就是這樣
- There you go, that's it.

338
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,070
不 我們走吧 快
- Oh. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Ruth, let's go, quick. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

339
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,940
知道了 
- All right. All right.

340
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,110
不是所有人都像你行動這么迅速
We can't all be built like a bloody whippet.

341
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,540
來吧
Come on. Come on.

342
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,210
我們得走了
We gotta go!

343
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,020
走吧
- Let's go. Let's go!

344
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,210
終點站到了 當然 這里都結冰了 通勤車不能通行
End of the line. The First is too frozen for the subtrain.

345
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,920
好
Okay.

346
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,350
天啊 這里真冷
Crikey, it's cold.

347
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,390
好 等一下
Just wait.

348
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,110
他們在這里待過 就在我們的眼皮底下
- They were here. Right under our noses.

349
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,530
背信棄義
Treachery.

350
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,870
你個機靈鬼
- Who are you,

351
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,450
你是誰 
you clever thing?

352
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,710
他們把這里的供熱調得很低 一直都在零下25度
- They got it on trickle, stays around minus 25.

353
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,550
我希望他們不會找到這里來 因為這里太冷 沒法生活
I'm hoping they won't look back here, because, you know, it's too cold to live.

354
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,220
我的天
Oh, my God.

355
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,350
怎么 凱文就不能把這里收拾一下 
What, Kevin couldn't put anything away?

356
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,860
魯絲 在這里面
In here, Ruth.

357
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,990
當心頭
Watch your head.

358
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,340
我找了幾個同志替你布置了一下
Had a couple of our comrades gussy it up for ya.

359
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,550
看 零下12度
See, minus 12.

360
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,340
真不錯 謝謝你
- It's lovely, thank you. - Yeah.

361
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,090
替我轉達一下謝意
- Send my regards down the line.

362
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,510
怎么了 
- What?

363
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,390
你喜歡我這機靈的身板嗎 
What, you likey that I'm built like a whippet?

364
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,140
什么呀 放尊重點
- No. Mind your cheek.

365
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,400
-謝謝你 -不客氣
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

366
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,450
雷頓先生 如果你在外面
- If you're out there, Mr. Layton,

367
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,780
現在是回來的好時機
now would be a great time to come home.

368
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,610
雪國列車 
"Snowpiercer,"

369
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,860
雪國列車 收到請回答
come in. "Snowpiercer."

370
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,490
糟糕
Oh, shit.

371
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,990
（溫度：14度 剩余8分鐘）

372
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,250
嘿 伙計
Hey, buddy.

373
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,330
你帶上沖浪板了嗎 
You bring your surfboard?

374
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,050
我想著還是改滑雪橇的好
- Thought we'd do some sledding instead.

375
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,510
兄弟 你的防護服還能撐多久 
Hey, what's your suit at, man?

376
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,470
7分45秒
- 7:45.

377
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
機車怎么樣了 
The Engine.

378
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,390
別為機車操心 艾莉在處理呢 本 你有哪里疼嗎 
- Don't worry about the Engine. Alex is on it. Where are you hurting, Ben?

379
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,730
胸口有點疼
Bit of pain in the chest.

380
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,350
手指和腳趾能動嗎 
- Can you move your fingers and toes?

381
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,940
很好
- All right.

382
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,440
-我這就下去 -太危險了 雷頓
I'm coming down. - Too risky, Layton.

383
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,150
放根繩子下來…
Send down a rope.

384
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,820
你別操心了 你等著 我馬上回來
- Oh, man. Don't worry about it. You sit tight, man. I'll be right back.

385
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,820
他們在排放燃料 
They're venting?

386
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,790
他們只是在緩緩前進 給引擎降溫 我不明白為什么要這樣做
They're just rolling fast enough to cool down. - I don't--I don't get it.

387
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,080
-我明白 -我覺得他們沒回來
- I do. - I don't think they got back on.

388
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,290
-你在說什么呢  -都有誰在外面 
What are you talking about? - So who's outside?

389
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,130
我不知道 你覺得他們有事會告訴我嗎 
- I don't know. You think they tell me anything?

390
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,590
我知道本之前下車了
I know Ben went out.

391
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,090
我從我房間的窗口 看到另有兩個人下去了
- Yeah, well, I think I saw two more from my window.

392
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,630
那準是艾莉在駕駛列車 她拋棄他們了嗎 
- Well, then Alex has to be driving. Did she ditch them?

393
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,100
-他們沒接電話 -馬汀 是時候了
They're not answering. Martin, it's time.

394
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,020
行 好 那提爾怎么辦 
Yeah. Okay. What about Till?

395
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,940
我們只能先去機車 看情況再說
- Well, we'll just have to go to the Engine and find out.

396
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,940
這是怎么回事 
What's happening?

397
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,230
我們得回去跟另一列列車匯合
We have to get back with the other train.

398
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,320
如果你幫忙 我就不告訴威爾福德 你很配合他們的事
Help us, and I won't tell Wilford you've been cooperating.

399
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,160
你不是認真的吧 
Are you serious right now?

400
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
絕對認真
- Deadly serious.

401
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,080
我們必須重新連接 好嗎  我們這都是在干什么 
Look, we need to reconnect. Okay? What are we doing out here?

402
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,920
我們在漫無目的地瞎轉悠 我們快沒食物了
- Yeah, we've been running around aimlessly. We're running out of food.

403
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,840
最后一次機會
Last chance.

404
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,800
要么回到威爾福德身邊
Get back with Wilford

405
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,840
要么就給雷頓陪葬
or dig a grave with Layton.

406
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,810
那就進牢房去
Then get in the cage.

407
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,450
現在的時速是多少 
What's our speed?

408
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,040
-75公里 -好 我們交換一下
Um, 75. - Okay, let's switch places;

409
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,830
我起動冷卻程序時 你得待在這里
I need you over here while I start the cooling sequence.

410
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,000
你得給這些電線配對
Okay, you're gonna match these lines.

411
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,090
藍色接藍色 紅色接紅色 諸如此類 明白了嗎 
Blue to blue, red to red, and so on, you got it?

412
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,050
明白
- Yeah.

413
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,340
制動員 你得確定哦 這些線是帶電的
- Be sure, Brakeman, okay? - These currents are live.

414
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,590
確定 對顏色嘛 我能行 換吧
- Yeah, match the colors. I got it. Let's go.

415
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,390
還有 我不是該死的制動員
And I'm not a freaking Brakeman.

416
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,810
嘿
Hey.

417
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,860
嘿 
Hey!

418
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,570
萬一他們問起來 就說是你逼我放你出來的
Okay, well, just in case they ask, you forced me to let you out.

419
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,600
好了

420
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,120
伙計 還剩多少時間 
- Hey. Time?

421
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,750
2分鐘
- Two minutes.

422
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,330
好 別擔心 兄弟 有足夠的時間
- All right, not to worry, brother. There's plenty to go around.

423
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,380
不多了 雷頓
Not too much, Layton.

424
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,760
別弄得咱倆都沒時間了
Let's not both run out.

425
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
嗯
Hey.

426
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,970
嘿 你之前說沖浪的事 你真的沖過浪 
Hey, hey. All that surf stuff you talking, you really do that?

427
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,020
本奈特
Bennet.

428
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,400
-沖浪的事  -對
- Surfing? - Yeah.

429
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:43,700
我16歲時 在索佩拉納待過一個夏天
Yeah, I spent a summer in Sopelana when I was 16.

430
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,080
當地人會沖一種叫“馬路牙子”的浪
Yeah, the locals surfed a wave called El Bordillo.

431
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,370
-是嗎  -是的
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

432
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,750
我在那浪尖上學到的 比大學七年學的都多
I learned more on that wave than in seven years of university.

433
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,170
你后來回去過嗎 
You ever go back?

434
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,090
嗯 回去過一次
Yeah, once.

435
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,640
-再去的時候 海平面已上升… -好
By then, the rising sea levels

436
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,810
…改變了海岸線
changed the coastline.

437
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,930
海浪沒有了
The wave was gone.

438
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,650
我們該往回開了吧 
- Shouldn't we start going back?

439
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,480
空燃比還是太低
We're still too rich.

440
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,150
-那要等多久  -我不知道 
- Well, how long? - I don't--I don't know.

441
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,200
嘿 艾莉 你能處理好的
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, Alex, you can do this.

442
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,700
-好嗎  -我不行
- Okay? - I can't.

443
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,490
如果換作梅蘭妮 她會怎么做 
What would Melanie do?

444
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,540
她會直接知道答案
- She would just know the answer. That's what she would do.

445
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,580
好吧 那…
Okay, fine, then.

446
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,590
如果換了是本呢 
What would--What would Ben do?

447
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,460
他會拿上紙和筆 邊畫邊解釋給你聽
- He would grab a pen and paper and start mansplaining.

448
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,420
好 很好 那就大聲把問題列出來吧
- Okay, good. Just--just talk it out, then.

449
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,100
當初設計這引擎 是為了在負載下高速行駛
- Built to work at speed, under load,

450
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,100
但我們既沒負載也沒速度
but we have neither.

451
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,230
它成了被困在玩具車上的噴氣發動機
We're a jet engine strapped to a toy wagon.

452
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,770
我們只需急剎車兩次
All we have to do is stop on a dime

453
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,070
確保不拋錨 也不耗盡燃料 其中一次反向即可
without stalling or burning up twice and once in reverse.

454
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,160
提爾 我們有三分鐘的時間 可以倒回去接他們
All right, Till, there's a three-minute window to reverse back to them.

455
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,910
你一直在躲著我嗎 
Have you been avoiding me?

456
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,210
我讓他們把你關在冷藏室里
- I told them to lock you in the meat locker.

457
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,960
他們覺得關在圖書館更安全 如今看來 安全個屁
They thought the library was more secure. So much for that.

458
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,540
他們都在外面嗎 
Are they all outside?

459
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,340
奧德麗 我現在有點忙
- I'm a bit busy right now, Audrey.

460
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,460
我能看得出來
Well, I can see that.

461
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,640
看呀 看看我有什么
Look. Look. Look, what I have.

462
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,180
看啊
Look!

463
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,600
他們抓我當人質時 它就在我身上了
I had it on me when they took me hostage.

464
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,940
我等了六個月 就為了這一刻
I have been waiting six months for this moment.

465
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,330
現在 讓我們談談 回去找“爹地”的事吧
Now let's talk about going home to Daddy.

466
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,370
抓緊了 我們到上面見 喬西 開始拉吧
- Hold on tight, buddy. I'll see you up there. - Josie, let's go.

467
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,000
好了 本
All right, Ben.

468
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,740
可以了
Here you go.

469
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,370
好 本 就差一點了 成了
All right. Nearly there, Ben. Nearly there. There, it's done.

470
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,240
你上來了 好了
Over the edge, that's it.

471
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,080
喬西 把開關扔給我 把他送回去
- Josie, throw me the switch and start back with him.

472
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:27,090
-不行 你不上來 我們不走 -他快不行了 快走 我會趕上的
- No, not till you're out of there. He's fading, Josie. Get going. I'll catch up.

473
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,090
-你的防護服還能撐多久  -足夠久 別擔心
What's your suit at? - Plenty. Don't worry about it.

474
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,180
我隨后就回去
I'm right behind you.

475
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,930
好了
Okay.

476
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,870
（防護服溫度：11度 剩余時間：7分21秒）

477
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,450

484
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,170
你媽死了 艾莉
- Your mother didn't make it, Alex.

485
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,720
外面有綠洲的那個想法 也隨她而去了
And that idea of an oasis out there died with her.

486
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,020
沒有隨她而去
No, it hasn't.

487
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,980
我覺得如果你們發現了什么的話
- Well, I think you would all be getting along much better

488
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,600
你們幾個的關系會好很多
if you discovered anything.

489
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,980
你根本不知道我們發現了什么
- Well, you have no idea what we've discovered.

490
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,790
威爾福德有解決方法 艾莉

491
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,340
繼續開 就能解決一切問題

492
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,890
繼續開就是
Just keep going.

493
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,120
不 不要 
No, don't.

494
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,280
離她遠點
Get away from her.

495
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,450
艾莉 我們得回去
Alex, you gotta go back.

496
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,870
往前開 艾莉 回他那里去
- Ahead, Alex. Back home to him.

497
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,080
我們不能把他們丟在外面
- We can't leave them out there.

498
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,500
什么爛好人 艾莉 別聽她的
- Don't listen to her bleeding heart, Alex.

499
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,590
學一學約瑟夫 算算存活率
Just do the calculus of survival like Joseph would.

500
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,710
夠了 你們倆都閉嘴 
- Stop! Both of you, just stop!

501
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,380
見鬼 
Shit.

502
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,680
只管繼續往前開 
Just go ahead!

503
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,480
艾莉

Alex, stop the train. What if she was right?

505
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,860
-萬一威爾福德是最好的選擇呢  -他不是
What if Wilford is the best bet? - He's not.

506
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,450
梅蘭妮才是
Melanie is.

507
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,950
好嗎 我們可以熬過這一關的 艾莉
Okay? We can get through this, Alex.

508
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,330
別選錯了方向
Don't tip it the wrong way.

509
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,210
好嗎 好
Okay? Yeah.

510
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,280

00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:29,150
這兩個家伙為了抵抗軍 從你們這里竊取了熱水
These two stole hot water resources from you for the resistance.

538
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,570
因為他們要干凈…
Because they had to be clean...

539
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,980
（道路 真理 我們的生存方式）

540
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,900
…你們就沒澡洗了
You go unwashed.

541
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,320
你先來
You first.

542
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,210
沒事的
It's all right.

543
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,670
那是值得的
It was worth it.

544
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,410
我也不想錯過公開羞辱的儀式
- Well, I hate to miss a public defiling,

545
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:23,660
但儀式早就開始多時了吧 
but the proceedings are rather foregone, aren't they?

546
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,290
我更愿意和朋友們 一起在這里 踏上一條新的征程
I'd much rather be here with my friends, embarking on a fresh path.

547
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,180
