1
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:11,837
- Two trains, two chapters to tell.

2
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,929
One runs hot and fast.

3
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:22,892
The other lumbers slow...

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,375
Cold-cast in Wilford's iron grip...

5
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:31,944
An armored tortoise plodding after a hare...

6
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:34,991
Everyone under a single thumb...

7
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:38,342
Serving a single obsession...

8
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:43,869
To retake the pirates and exact his revenge.

9
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:46,263
I can smell them.

10
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:50,572
Layton took my engine through here

11
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,008
about a month ago,

12
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,576
judging by the ice buildup.

13
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:57,057
Practically on their heels.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,059
You see?

15
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,017
Like old footprints in the snow.

16
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,542
Set switch for the south fork, Engineer.

17
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:07,371
We'll get it back, Jupe,

18
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,112
whatever it takes.

19
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:07,388
- Inside, it's a backwards world.

20
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:11,131
Only one class now,

21
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:14,482
the working class, freezing, stitching,

22
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:17,311
fixing, suffering.

23
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,980
- Hey, this isn't a pass-through.

24
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:46,296
- Winnipeg. - Message for the top.

25
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,131
- But frostbitten fingers hold fast.

26
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,743
Deep in the iced-over bowels

27
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:00,267
where Wilford never treads...

28
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,968
A spark still lives:

29
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:09,189
the resistance, nurtured and protected

30
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,103
by the bravest of the brave.

31
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,807
- Message for the tippity-top.

32
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,680
- I didn't hear the password, Mr. Pike.

33
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,247
I expect more from my second in command.

34
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,033
They picked up sign of Snowpiercer.

35
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:30,645
We turned south, back on the main line.

36
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,561
Oh, thank God for that.

37
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,911
This is the first proof

38
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:39,393
we've had that they are still alive in 32 days.

39
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,395
They must--they must have their reasons

40
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,613
for all this traipsing about.

41
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,049
I mean, if Melanie's aboard--

42
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:46,182
We don't know.

43
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:52,275
- You ever think, Ruth, all alone down here at night,

44
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,799
that since Layton bailed on us in the first place,

45
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,453
he might never come back?

46
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:00,414
No, I don't.

47
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:02,198
And neither do you, or you wouldn't be

48
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,808
- in the resistance.

49
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:07,421
- So antibiotics for the seamstresses.

50
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:10,206
They'll need them, all jammed up together in that sweatshop.

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,468
- Uh-huh. - It's these little things

52
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:13,296
that will keep us sane, Mr. Pike.

53
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,558
The passengers can survive all of this

54
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:16,038
if we can ease their journey.

55
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,520
And keep them ready for Mr. Layton's return.

56
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,437
- The heart of hope still beats

57
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,222
aboard Wilford's rolling gulag,

58
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,703
1,023 cars long.

59
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,175
Okay.

60
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:08,612
Should be clear of track contaminants.

61
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:11,180
I'm gonna start pulling ice samples.

62
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:12,573
How's it looking?

63
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:14,575
- Palm trees, golden sands.

64
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:17,055
Gotta catch me some North Korean waves.

65
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,406
- Nice. I'll grab my board. I'll be right out, bro.

66
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:20,798
- Let him focus. - I'm keeping him calm.

67
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,452
You're distracting him.

68
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,062
- Ben, the suit's at 22 minutes.

69
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,107
Your heart rate's good.

70
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,543
You steady on, okay?

71
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:27,805
Copy that.

72
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,556
Engine any happier?

73
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,428
- We're venting, but still too hot.

74
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,996
How's it looking?

75
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,608
Oh, minus 86.

76
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:50,088
Oh, well, I'm sure glad we came all this way.

77
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:52,003
- Well, don't mistake the weather for the climate.

78
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,397
Ben's samples will show us the full picture.

79
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,094
We're looking for trends.

80
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:57,835
- I thought we were looking for a place to live.

81
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,097
The model likes this spot.

82
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:00,272
Let's just wait for the results.

83
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,013
Oh, the model.

84
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:04,842
- Hey, Till, remember how much the model liked Sulawesi?

85
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,540
Yeah, I do.

86
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,889
Six months of going around the world

87
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,369
with nothing to show for it.

88
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:10,848
- And we learned something from every stop.

89
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,197
Think of them as data points.

90
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:13,895
- Okay, Professor Layton.

91
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:15,679
- They were not frozen hellscapes.

92
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,725
They were data points.

93
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:18,856
Correct.

94
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,390
Shit.

95
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:34,132
- I need to talk to him. - Okay.

96
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,179
- Ben, we just blew a thermal switch

97
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:38,746
on the main line.

98
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:41,009
- It's gotta be an error. - It isn't.

99
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,837
We came in too rich. I told you that.

100
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,013
- Just discharge the excess, Alex.

101
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:46,188
She'll rebalance.

102
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:47,494
If I discharge any more,

103
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,583
we won't be able to get going again.

104
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:52,020
We have to abort. Pull him in.

105
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:53,630
She's wrong, Layton.

106
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:56,459
She can ride the levels. Ten more minutes.

107
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,853
- We're burning up. We need to go right now.

108
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,464
Do what you can.

109
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,598
- I told him we came in too rich.

110
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,208
Okay.

111
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,864
Everything's under control.

112
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:12,388
- Ben, just stay on task. Okay?

113
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,147
Hey.

114
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,453
She touchy this morning?

115
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,455
- Scathing. So mean.

116
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,414
- Sykes is on her way. - Great.

117
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:42,244
Why have we stopped again?

118
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:45,334
You know, they're not gonna find an oasis.

119
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,423
- You know that. - I don't know anything.

120
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,772
It's easier that way.

121
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:50,948
- Ugh, know no one, feel nothing.

122
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,602
You're a woman alone, my jailer.

123
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,082
Well, at least I got you.

124
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,519
You gonna be civil, or do you want me

125
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:57,825
to feed you in there?

126
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,175
- Mm-mm. - Monsters first.

127
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:01,568
- No, please. - No.

128
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:06,529
- Okay. Today's dwindling selection.

129
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:10,054
We have the boeuf bourguignon, the carbonara,

130
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:12,448
the dreaded chicken mushroom bag,

131
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,929
and the last Thai vegetable.

132
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:17,453
- You seem to enjoy working for these pirates.

133
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,021
- Just a POW doing my time, Audrey.

134
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:22,284
- Well, he'd be disgusted with your cooperation.

135
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:23,938
Can you please?

136
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,505
- If nobody wants the Thai vegetable...

137
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,550
- Just give me the carbonara, Martin.

138
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,465
Carbonara, it's the worst.

139
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:33,556
- Ben?

140
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,210
Ben, the wind's picking up.

141
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:36,690
It looks like there's a front coming in.

142
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:38,822
- Copy that. I'm on my way back.

143
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,737
- How's Alex? - Alex, status.

144
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:42,347
We're not actively on fire.

145
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,698
Tell him to hurry.

146
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:48,092
- She says she took your advice and everything's working out.

147
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,964
- Uh-huh.

148
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,096
So much blown snow.

149
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,881
A lot of wind comes through this basin.

150
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:55,360
- Well, that's good, though, right?

151
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:57,014
Could be.

152
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:59,800
Might be our warm spot stirring things up.

153
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:16,730
Whoa!

154
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,691
- Ben. - Ben?

155
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:24,172
- Ben. - Ben, come in, Ben.

156
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,304
- I can't see him. - Ben.

157
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,829
- Ben! Ben, do you copy?

158
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:30,395
Ben.

159
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,402
Ben, come in.

160
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,143
Ben, your sig--

161
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:43,844
Ben--

162
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:47,935
- Ben, the signal--

163
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:53,636
The bit I don't get, Bess,

164
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,985
when we return to Wilford

165
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,552
with your precious climate model,

166
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,032
what happens then?

167
00:09:58,075 --> 00:09:59,337
Negotiations.

168
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:00,861
Both trains want to reconnect.

169
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:03,472
- Yeah. Hostage negotiations first.

170
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:05,126
You for Zarah.

171
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,737
- Yeah, but then what?

172
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:10,348
- Wilford's 2,700 to your 7?

173
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,134
He's not gonna take too kindly to a traitor and a stowaway.

174
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,570
How am I a stowaway?

175
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,702
I woke up from a nap in my carriage

176
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,138
and the train was gone,

177
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:19,401
along with my husband and my twin boys.

178
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:20,707
Till here.

179
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,882
- Yeah, I need you to lock them down

180
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,535
- and get up here. - What's up?

181
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:24,667
- Nothing they need to know about.

182
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,103
- All right. On my way.

183
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:27,931
Ben, do you read?

184
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:28,932
All right, that's lunch.

185
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:30,630
Martin, lock her up.

186
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,240
- Is something wrong? - Move, go.

187
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:38,681
- Hey, I saw Ben going outside earlier.

188
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,727
- Do you need help? - No, everything's good.

189
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,250
We're good.

190
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:44,469
On it.

191
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:47,516
- Till. Hey, what's going on?

192
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,431
You stay in your quarters.

193
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,476
Wait till the engine gives the all-clear.

194
00:10:52,956 --> 00:10:54,305
- That's it? - Yep.

195
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:06,143
I'm going out there.

196
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:07,492
- No, you're not. I'm going.

197
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,190
- Neither of you are going anywhere.

198
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,713
We can't stay here.

199
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,280
Ben. Ben, do you copy?

200
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:13,847
We are not leaving him.

201
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,500
- Layton, if we don't get rolling right now,

202
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:16,501
we will melt down.

203
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,329
How long do you need?

204
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,070
- 8 minutes to get up to speed,

205
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,116
10 to 12 minutes to run a discharge sequence.

206
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,421
- Great. Go. - Whoa, whoa.

207
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:24,814
And leave you outside?

208
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:25,946
- The breach suits have 30 minutes.

209
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,512
You go, you come back for me.

210
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,471
- You are staying here. - Yeah. Like, hell I am.

211
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,520
It's not a discussion, Josie.

212
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,000
If all three of us get in trouble out there,

213
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:38,698
there's no one left for off-train work.

214
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,656
- Yeah, well, I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

215
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,615
- You know, one time, just for a change of pace,

216
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,922
you could respect the chain of command.

217
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,924
Chain of command?

218
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,534
Layton, this isn't a battleship.

219
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:51,014
It's a bloody life raft.

220
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,189
And you're staying on it.

221
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,456
- Ben shouldn't even be out there.

222
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,719
- He knew what he was getting into.

223
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,546
- Yeah. Chasing Melanie's ghost.

224
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,548
Her theory.

225
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:05,812
We all agreed.

226
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,683
We find New Eden, then we go back for the others.

227
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,033
- And what if there is no New Eden?

228
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,382
What if she's wrong?

229
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,344
Guess we just all go down with her, eh?

230
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:21,784
- Till, you're gonna have to pilot us out of here.

231
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:23,177
- Me? Why?

232
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,961
- Because I need to go deal with that.

233
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,529
- What? Oh, Jesus.

234
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,705
Jesus. Yeah, okay.

235
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,881
I--I got it.

236
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,026
- You're starting to believe your own hype.

237
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,810
You do know that, don't you?

238
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:49,725
- I'm just trying to keep everyone alive.

239
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,379
Yep. We know.

240
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:52,946
Our great savior.

241
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,556
Never my words.

242
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,818
- I was there at the beginning in The Tail,

243
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:57,559
in the muck and the shit.

244
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,169
I know who you are.

245
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,041
- You encouraged me to be a leader.

246
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:04,871
- Not for this. Didn't ask for any of this.

247
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:09,440
- Engine, we're at the bay door.

248
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:10,833
Release the safety.

249
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,836
Uh, copy.

250
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,403
Bay door safety?

251
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:17,057
System panel, top right.

252
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,777
Josie, be careful.

253
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,737
- Yeah. Yeah, you too.

254
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,972
You see anything?

255
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,887
We're on the wrong side.

256
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,323
Well, we've been stopped

257
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:07,934
for an awfully long time, haven't we?

258
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:12,460
Engine, we're clear.

259
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:13,678
- Okay. Copy.

260
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:14,854
They're clear!

261
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,681
- Okay. Take us up to 20.

262
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:24,211
- Easy! Easy.

263
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,590
- This is the general consolidated ledger.

264
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,984
And you can see where the quartermaster

265
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,508
detected pilfering.

266
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:03,206
- Cleverly dispersed along the supply chain.

267
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,426
- Laytonites, or what's left of them.

268
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,863
- Yeah. Someone's playing Robin Hood.

269
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,912
Zarah. Zarah.

270
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,261
How are you feeling?

271
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:15,653
Enormous.

272
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,133
- I'm fine, thank you.

273
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:18,961
Oh, good.

274
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,224
- I have the engineering report, Javi.

275
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,617
- I'll take that. - Ah-ah-ah.

276
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,401
Let's hear it from her.

277
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:26,534
I appreciate how you deliver bad news, Zarah.

278
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:28,405
Always a clear-eyed view.

279
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:34,585
- So, then, your water pipes are still frozen.

280
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:36,674
Most of Second and parts of Third.

281
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:38,894
And Ag-Sec output is down again,

282
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,113
but only by 6% this week.

283
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,636
- This is pilfering. I was--

284
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,073
- And last night, 43 sleepers and The Chains

285
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:45,901
lost heat completely.

286
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,556
162 passengers remain evacuated.

287
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:50,558
- Well, if we can't keep them all warm at once,

288
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,995
they'll just have to be miserable in shifts.

289
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,692
We'll cut First Class.

290
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,433
Out of the question.

291
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:57,782
- Well, you did decommission it, Joseph.

292
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:59,436
It's empty and frozen.

293
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,177
- Cut the weight. - I will restore First to glory

294
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,310
when I get my engine back-- and Audrey with it.

295
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:06,835
- Perhaps there's another way to conserve energy.

296
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:09,142
- Like a cull. - No, Kevin, you ghoul.

297
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:10,752
- Please berate him.

298
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:12,101
Remind him there are rules.

299
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,363
Sorry to disappoint, Kevin.

300
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,017
But minus an arm or two,

301
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,932
we keep everyone as alive as possible

302
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,935
so Audrey stays as alive as possible.

303
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,155
- Of course. - And you too, my dear.

304
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:27,116
- That's been guaranteed, hasn't it?

305
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,252
Bye, Javi.

306
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:35,733
- Rules.

307
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,215
The resistance is not so constrained.

308
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,088
Every game has rules, Kevin.

309
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,306
Get creative.

310
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,730
Let go!

311
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,781
Jackboot Tyson.

312
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,609
- Can you get me out of compost or not?

313
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,220
One more week.

314
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:30,179
But in the meantime, how about a nice hot bath?

315
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:32,573
You taking the piss?

316
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,140
Nah, ooh.

317
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:38,231
Bathing token for services to the cause.

318
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:45,803
- What can we do for you, Kevin?

319
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,197
- Hmm. Ovaltine.

320
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,677
Yeah, we don't have Ovaltine.

321
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,201
We have train-made hooch.

322
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:55,291
- Fine. One hooch.

323
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,990
Mr. Wilford loves what you've done with the place,

324
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:02,342
but I'm afraid he needs just a smidge more

325
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:03,473
from the deal.

326
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:04,605
Information?

327
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:12,613
- The subversives continue filching and currying favor

328
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:15,572
while their shot caller keeps slipping through our fingers.

329
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,705
We would like this person identified

330
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,882
and captured... now.

331
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,756
- Maybe our passed-out Jack knows something.

332
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:29,847
Jackboot Whiggins?

333
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,459
Oi, Stuie.

334
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,287
Wake up, Whiggins.

335
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:39,292
- What? You said I could stay. Oh!

336
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:40,902
- They put you on Water Security, yeah?

337
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,643
Yes.

338
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:44,340
- You're a former Firstie, so you'll be glad to help.

339
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:47,648
- Well, what's happening in Water Security?

340
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:51,869
Uh, you know, nothing.

341
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,003
Yeah.

342
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:57,919
Um, well,

343
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:00,574
you know, very little.

344
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,793
Kevin doesn't need much.

345
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:05,622
- Just a little thread to pick. Come on.

346
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,363
Ugh.

347
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:10,540
- Well, I've heard that the Second Class Watermaster

348
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:14,240
was giving away hot baths

349
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,937
for service to the resistance.

350
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:20,202
Let's have a look.

351
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:25,425
Oh, that's healing nicely.

352
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:27,209
Have you applied your cream today?

353
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,604
- No, sir. - Well, then allow me.

354
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:40,179
Oh, it's all right, cub.

355
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,964
It's all right. You like me now.

356
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:46,054
This business with Jupiter.

357
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:49,318
I know she's a blunt tool, Javier.

358
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:54,280
But when you're one man responsible for nearly 3,000...

359
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,109
It's not enough being a disciplinarian.

360
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:01,156
You need to add a little chaos to the mix.

361
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,810
In here, it's Jupiter.

362
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,768
Out there, it's Kevin, gnashing his teeth

363
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,509
and running amok.

364
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:10,383
You can't fight the unpredictable, Javier.

365
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,951
That's how I keep everyone safe.

366
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,171
Anyway...

367
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,173
I hope you see it for what it is.

368
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,352
I do need you, Javier.

369
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:32,274
Good man.

370
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:37,888
Wilford.

371
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:39,977
Sir, we have a lead.

372
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,084
Stand up, stand up.

373
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:04,828
Watermaster Arnoldo Reyas.

374
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:10,704
- Sí, señor. The Engine will provide.

375
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,364
Clean as a baby.

376
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,288
Come on.

377
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:31,942
Come on out before you get cold.

378
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,168
- The Watermaster told them where we are.

379
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:42,692
- Gotta go. - Again.

380
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,050
- Okay. - Okay.

381
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,313
- Come on. - I'm coming.

382
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,315
- There you go, that's it.

383
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:57,881
- Oh. - No, no, no, no, no, no.

384
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,274
Ruth, let's go, quick.

385
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,362
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

386
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,972
- All right. All right.

387
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:04,105
We can't all be built like a bloody whippet.

388
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,507
Come on. Come on.

389
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,903
That's full! Set it down!

390
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,557
We gotta go!

391
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:31,785
- Let's go. Let's go!

392
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:58,551
End of the line.

393
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:01,554
The First is too frozen for the subtrain.

394
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:05,340
Okay.

395
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,169
Oh.

396
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:11,128
Crikey, it's cold.

397
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:13,957
Just wait.

398
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:28,450
- They were here. Right under our noses.

399
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,234
Treachery.

400
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:35,283
- Who are you, you clever thing?

401
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:40,984
- They got it on trickle, stays around minus 25.

402
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,464
I'm hoping they won't look back here,

403
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:45,511
because, you know, it's too cold to live.

404
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,784
Oh, my God.

405
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:00,917
What, Kevin couldn't put anything away?

406
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,878
In here, Ruth.

407
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:12,059
Watch your head.

408
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:24,158
Had a couple of our comrades gussy it up for ya.

409
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:27,117
See, minus 12.

410
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:29,163
- It's lovely, thank you. - Yeah.

411
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:30,904
- Send my regards down the line.

412
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,560
- What?

413
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:37,214
What, you likey that I'm built like a whippet?

414
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:40,000
- No. Mind your cheek.

415
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:44,439
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

416
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:53,492
- If you're out there, Mr. Layton,

417
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,798
now would be a great time to come home.

418
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,485
"Snowpiercer," come in.

419
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,618
"Snowpiercer."

420
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,885
Oh, shit.

421
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:40,626
Hey, buddy.

422
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:46,806
You bring your surfboard?

423
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,590
- Thought we'd do some sledding instead.

424
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:51,506
Hey, what's your suit at, man?

425
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,379
- 7:45. The Engine.

426
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:56,511
- Don't worry about the Engine.

427
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,599
Alex is on it.

428
00:25:57,643 --> 00:26:00,123
Where are you hurting, Ben?

429
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,734
Bit of pain in the chest.

430
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:04,171
- Can you move your fingers and toes?

431
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:06,652
- All right. I'm coming down.

432
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:09,785
- Too risky, Layton. Send down a rope.

433
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:11,570
- Oh, man. Don't worry about it.

434
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,875
You sit tight, man. I'll be right back.

435
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,576
They're venting?

436
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,665
They're just rolling fast enough to cool down.

437
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,667
- I don't--I don't get it. - I do.

438
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,103
- I don't think they got back on.

439
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:24,539
- Mm? - What are you talking about?

440
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,281
- So who's outside? - I don't know.

441
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:28,543
You think they tell me anything?

442
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,719
I know Ben went out.

443
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:33,069
- Yeah, well, I think I saw two more from my window.

444
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:34,984
- Well, then Alex has to be driving.

445
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:37,334
Did she ditch them?

446
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:38,640
They're not answering.

447
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:41,077
Martin, it's time.

448
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:45,429
Yeah. Okay.

449
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,996
What about Till?

450
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,563
- Well, we'll just have to go to the Engine

451
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,912
and find out.

452
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:50,913
What's happening?

453
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:52,175
We have to get back

454
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,524
with the other train.

455
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,222
Help us, and I won't tell Wilford

456
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:57,398
you've been cooperating.

457
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,140
Are you serious right now?

458
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,057
- Deadly serious.

459
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,059
Look, we need to reconnect.

460
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:07,582
Okay? What are we doing out here?

461
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,018
- Yeah, we've been running around aimlessly.

462
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:11,630
We're running out of food. Last chance.

463
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,327
Hmm?

464
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,810
Get back with Wilford or dig a grave with Layton.

465
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:24,773
Then get in the cage.

466
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:42,835
What's our speed?

467
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:46,099
Um, 75.

468
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:48,101
- Okay, let's switch places; I need you over here

469
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:49,798
while I start the cooling sequence.

470
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:51,844
Okay, you're gonna match these lines.

471
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:55,064
Blue to blue, red to red, and so on, you got it?

472
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,501
- Yeah. - Be sure, Brakeman, okay?

473
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,286
- These currents are live. - Yeah, match the colors.

474
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:01,680
I got it. Let's go.

475
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:06,249
And I'm not a freaking Brakeman.

476
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:13,735
Hey.

477
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:16,259
Hey!

478
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,957
Okay, well, just in case they ask,

479
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,481
you forced me to let you out.

480
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:06,222
- Hey. Time?

481
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:08,137
- Two minutes.

482
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:10,749
- All right, not to worry, brother.

483
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:14,665
There's plenty to go around.

484
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,842
Not too much, Layton.

485
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,626
Let's not both run out.

486
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:19,801
- Uh-huh.

487
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,281
Hey.

488
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:27,069
Hey, hey.

489
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:28,636
All that surf stuff you talking,

490
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,899
you really do that?

491
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:32,292
Bennet.

492
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,033
Hmm?

493
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:36,513
- Surfing? - Yeah.

494
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:39,603
Yeah, I spent a summer

495
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:43,346
in Sopelana when I was 16.

496
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:47,916
Yeah, the locals surfed a wave called El Bordillo.

497
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,919
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

498
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,355
I learned more on that wave

499
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,836
than in seven years of university.

500
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:59,580
You ever go back?

501
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:02,713
Yeah, once.

502
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:07,022
By then, the rising sea levels

503
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,415
changed the coastline.

504
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:11,200
The wave was gone.

505
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:16,640
- Shouldn't we start going back?

506
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:18,425
We're still too rich.

507
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:21,123
- Well, how long? - I don't--I don't know.

508
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:25,084
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, Alex, you can do this.

509
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,521
- Okay? - I can't.

510
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:30,611
What would Melanie do?

511
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,570
- She would just know the answer.

512
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:34,571
That's what she would do.

513
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,747
Okay, fine, then.

514
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,575
What would--What would Ben do?

515
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:41,274
- He would grab a pen and paper and start mansplaining.

516
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:44,843
- Okay, good. Just--just talk it out, then.

517
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,721
- Built to work at speed, under load,

518
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,679
but we have neither.

519
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:58,857
We're a jet engine strapped to a toy wagon.

520
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,641
All we have to do is stop on a dime

521
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:01,903
without stalling or burning up

522
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:04,036
twice and once in reverse.

523
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,822
All right, Till, there's a three-minute window

524
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,084
to reverse back to them.

525
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,303
Have you been avoiding me?

526
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,744
- I told them to lock you in the meat locker.

527
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:18,528
They thought the library was more secure.

528
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:19,921
So much for that.

529
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:21,575
Are they all outside?

530
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:22,750
- I'm a bit busy right now, Audrey.

531
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:25,709
Well, I can see that.

532
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:29,235
Ahh.

533
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:31,933
Look.

534
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,630
Look. Look, what I have.

535
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:36,068
Look!

536
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:39,158
I had it on me when they took me hostage.

537
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:42,988
I have been waiting six months for this moment.

538
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:56,392
Now let's talk about going home to Daddy.

539
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:06,663
- Have you discovered a new source?

540
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:09,492
- No. - We'll tighten our belts.

541
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:22,462
I'm not listening to you.

542
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,033
You know I make things...

543
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:36,519
- Hold on tight, buddy. I'll see you up there.

544
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:39,609
- Josie, let's go.

545
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:43,439
All right, Ben.

546
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:12,381
Here you go.

547
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:13,643
All right. Nearly there, Ben.

548
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:16,211
Nearly there. There, it's done.

549
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:18,344
Over the edge, that's it.

550
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:23,044
- Josie, throw me the switch and start back with him.

551
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,132
- No, not till you're out of there.

552
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:25,525
He's fading, Josie.

553
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:27,135
Get going. I'll catch up.

554
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:33,620
What's your suit at?

555
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:35,970
- Plenty. Don't worry about it.

556
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,711
I'm right behind you.

557
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:40,018
Okay.

558
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,478
Hello.

559
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,267
Hello?

560
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:58,303
Ow! Oh, my God!

561
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,526
Layton, come in, Layton.

562
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,182
Layton, come in, Layton.

563
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:42,782
- Your mother didn't make it, Alex.

564
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:46,307
And that idea of an oasis out there

565
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:47,613
died with her.

566
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:50,093
No, it hasn't.

567
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:52,835
- Well, I think you would all be getting along much better

568
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,576
if you discovered anything.

569
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,362
- Well, you have no idea what we've discovered.

570
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,682
- Wilford has the answers, Alex.

571
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:19,122
Just keep going, and you solve everything.

572
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:25,868
Just keep going.

573
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,890
No, don't.

574
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:49,327
Get away from her.

575
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,287
Alex, you gotta go back.

576
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,594
- Ahead, Alex. Back home to him.

577
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:57,160
- We can't leave them out there.

578
00:38:57,204 --> 00:38:59,032
- Don't listen to her bleeding heart, Alex.

579
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:01,556
Just do the calculus of survival like Joseph would.

580
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,385
- Stop! Both of you, just stop!

581
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:05,386
Shit.

582
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,695
Just go ahead!

583
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:19,444
Alex.

584
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:21,750
Alex, stop the train.

585
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:23,535
What if she was right?

586
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:24,753
What if Wilford is the best bet?

587
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:27,408
- He's not. Melanie is.

588
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,192
Okay?

589
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:31,760
We can get through this, Alex.

590
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:33,849
Don't tip it the wrong way.

591
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:38,027
Okay? Yeah.

592
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:54,756
- "Snowpiercer." Come in, "Snowpiercer."

593
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:00,980
Layton, Layton, can you read me?

594
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:03,983
Layton.

595
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:07,900
"Snowpiercer," come in.

596
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:10,816
Shit.

597
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:13,122
There.

598
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,473
There they are.

599
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,431
There's only two-- there's only two of them.

600
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,059
- Wait, wait. - Sit there.

601
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:46,286
Layton, come in, Layton.

602
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:51,204
Layton, come in, Layton.

603
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,730
Look, I'll be back, okay?

604
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:58,037
- Josie, you've been out too long.

605
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:01,475
- I can find him. I'll be back.

606
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,958
- Josie, his suit ran out five minutes ago.

607
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,318
Layton.

608
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,539
Layton!

609
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:26,021
- What? What? He's there?

610
00:42:26,065 --> 00:42:27,501
- Yes. - He's there?

611
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,807
He's there.

612
00:42:58,097 --> 00:43:02,014
So what can I get you?

613
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:04,625
- I'd say I've got everything I ever wanted.

614
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:08,586
A girl, a club,

615
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:11,240
and the gratitude of the great Mr. Wilford.

616
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:14,635
Come on.

617
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:22,164
- Wouldn't we all love a nice warm bath?

618
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,775
Hmm?

619
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:27,779
These two stole hot water resources from you

620
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:29,868
for the resistance.

621
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:31,521
Because they had to be clean...

622
00:43:33,915 --> 00:43:35,961
You go unwashed.

623
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:37,658
You first.

624
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,094
He didn't do anything.

625
00:43:49,888 --> 00:43:52,020
It's all right.

626
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:53,674
It was worth it.

627
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:56,590
Do it, please.

628
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:20,222
- Well, I hate to miss a public defiling,

629
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:23,399
but the proceedings are rather foregone, aren't they?

630
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:27,577
I'd much rather be here with my friends,

631
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:29,318
embarking on a fresh path.
