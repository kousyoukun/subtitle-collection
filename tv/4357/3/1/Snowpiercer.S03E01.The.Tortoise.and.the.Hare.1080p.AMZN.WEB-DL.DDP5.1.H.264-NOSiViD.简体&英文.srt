1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,960
（六个月后）

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,760
两列火车 两个不同的篇章
- Two trains, two chapters to tell.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,720
一列高速飞驰
One runs hot and fast.

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,900
另一列蹒跚而行
The other lumbers slow...

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,690
那是威尔福德铁腕掌控下的列车
Cold-cast in Wilford's iron grip...

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,030
一只在兔子身后策划阴谋的 武装的乌龟
An armored tortoise plodding after a hare...

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,990
所有人都受同一个人控制
Everyone under a single thumb...

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,370
服务于同一个偏执的目标…
Serving a single obsession...

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,920
夺回被盗的东西 实施他的报复
To retake the pirates and exact his revenge.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,210
我能闻到他们的气味
I can smell them.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,510
从结冰情况来看
Layton took my engine through here

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,050
大约一个月前 雷顿把我的机车带到这里来过
about a month ago, judging by the ice buildup.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,220
我们已经紧随其后了
Practically on their heels.

14
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,020
看到没 
You see?

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,180
就像雪地里的足迹一样
Like old footprints in the snow.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,560
工程师 转到往南去的岔路上
Set switch for the south fork, Engineer.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,070
我们会把它夺回来的 朱庇特 不惜任何代价
We'll get it back, Jupe, whatever it takes.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,780
列车鸣汽笛

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,490
催人眼迷离

20
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,040
男孩女孩们

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,750
钻进毯子里

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,460
司机伴引擎

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,050
消防员按铃

24
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,640
睡魔摇灯笼

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
一切都安宁

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,310
一路摇啊晃

27
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,860
沿海湾启程

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,610
跋涉数千里

29
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,200
开往晨光镇

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,080
列车途经处

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,620
或许在下雨

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,500
所有小旅客…

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,460
列车里是一个倒退的世界
- Inside, it's a backwards world.

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,750
如今只有一个阶级了
Only one class now,

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,840
那就是工人阶级
the working class, freezing, stitching,

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,930
缝补修葺 忍冻受罪
fixing, suffering.

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:25,100
跋涉数千里 开往晨光镇

38
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,900
嘿 这里不是过道 
- Hey, this isn't a pass-through.

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,830
-温妮佩 -有给头儿捎的信
- Winnipeg. - Message for the top.

40
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,050
不过 挨冻的人们更会抱作一团
- But frostbitten fingers hold fast.

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,300
在寒冰深处 威尔福德从不涉足的地方
Deep in the iced-over bowels where Wilford never treads...

42
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,890
依然有一丝火花在闪耀
A spark still lives:

43
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,350
那就是抵抗军
the resistance,

44
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,440
由勇者中的勇者培养并守护着
nurtured and protected by the bravest of the brave.

45
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,740
给头儿捎的信
- Message for the tippity-top.

46
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,700
派克先生 你没说暗号
- I didn't hear the password, Mr. Pike.

47
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,990
你是我的二把手 我对你的期望比这要高
I expect more from my second in command.

48
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,580
他们发现了雪国列车的踪迹
They picked up sign of Snowpiercer.

49
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,710
我们已转向南面 回到了主轨道上
We turned south, back on the main line.

50
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,420
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God for that.

51
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,470
32天了 这是第一个 证明他们还活着的消息
This is the first proof we've had that they are still alive in 32 days.

52
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,800
他们这样到处闲转 一定有他们的原因
They must--they must have their reasons for all this traipsing about.

53
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,060
如果梅兰妮在列车上的话
I mean, if Melanie's aboard--

54
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,270
这又说不定的
We don't know.

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,440
鲁丝 晚上你一个人 待在这下面时 有没有想过
- You ever think, Ruth, all alone down here at night,

56
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,900
既然当初是雷顿抛下了我们
that since Layton bailed on us in the first place,

57
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,570
他可能永远都不会回来了 
he might never come back?

58
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,820
没想过
No, I don't.

59
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,910
你也没有 否则你不会加入抵抗军
And neither do you, or you wouldn't be in the resistance.

60
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,450
好了 这些抗生素给裁缝们 她们会需要的
- So antibiotics for the seamstresses. They'll need them,

61
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,750
大家都挤在那个血汗工厂里
all jammed up together in that sweatshop.

62
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,290
这些小小的补给品能让我们保持理智
It's these little things that will keep us sane, Mr. Pike.

63
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,300
如果我们能让旅途稍微舒服点 乘客们就能熬过这一关
The passengers can survive all of this if we can ease their journey.

64
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,550
让他们为雷顿先生的归来做好准备
And keep them ready for Mr. Layton's return.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,680
威尔福德1023节车厢长的集中营 轰隆前行
- The heart of hope still beats aboard Wilford's rolling gulag,

66
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,980
在车上依然跳动着满怀希望的心
1,023 cars long.

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,100
好 这里应该不会有轨道污染物了
Okay. Should be clear of track contaminants.

68
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,680
我要开始采集冰样了
I'm gonna start pulling ice samples.

69
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,440
外面看上去怎么样 
How's it looking?

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,650
棕榈树 金沙滩
- Palm trees, golden sands.

71
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,110
我得去赶朝鲜的海浪
Gotta catch me some North Korean waves.

72
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,440
真不错 我去拿一下冲浪板 马上就出去 兄弟
- Nice. I'll grab my board. I'll be right out, bro.

73
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,360
让他集中精力
- Let him focus.

74
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,700
-我是在帮他保持冷静 -你是在让他分心
- I'm keeping him calm. - You're distracting him.

75
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,110
本 你的防护服还能坚持22分钟 你的心率正常
- Ben, the suit's at 22 minutes. Your heart rate's good.

76
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,740
不用紧张 好吗 
You steady on, okay?

77
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,870
收到
Copy that.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,170
引擎运转得好点了吗 
Engine any happier?

79
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,590
在排放燃料 但还是过热
- We're venting, but still too hot.

80
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,670
外面的情况如何 
How's it looking?

81
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,140
“零下86摄氏度”
Oh, minus 86.

82
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,140
好吧 亏我们还大老远跑来这里
Oh, well, I'm sure glad we came all this way.

83
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,020
别把天气和气候的概念搞混了
- Well, don't mistake the weather for the climate.

84
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,560
本采集的样本会显示气候的全貌
Ben's samples will show us the full picture.

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,060
我们是在寻找趋势
We're looking for trends.

86
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,270
我还以为我们是在找宜居的地方
- I thought we were looking for a place to live.

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,690
模型说这里是合适地点 等采样结果出来再说
The model likes this spot. Let's just wait for the results.

88
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,610
“模型”
Oh, the model.

89
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,950
嘿 提尔 还记得之前 模型说苏拉威西岛很合适吗 
- Hey, Till, remember how much the model liked Sulawesi?

90
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,570
记得
Yeah, I do.

91
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,530
我们环行世界六个月了 却没拿得出手的成绩
Six months of going around the world with nothing to show for it.

92
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,370
每一次停留 我们都了解到了新信息
- And we learned something from every stop.

93
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,910
-就把它们当作是数据点嘛 -行 雷顿教授
Think of them as data points.  Okay, Professor Layton.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,830
那些不是冰冻的地狱 而是数据点
- They were not frozen hellscapes. They were data points.

95
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
没错
Correct.

96
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,350
糟糕
Shit.

97
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,810
（热敏开关故障）

98
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,060
-我需要跟他通话 -好
- I need to talk to him. - Okay.

99
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,650
本 主管道上的一个热敏开关坏了
- Ben, we just blew a thermal switch on the main line.

100
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,020
-准是误报 -不是的
- It's gotta be an error. - It isn't.

101
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,860
我跟你说过 我们的空燃比太小了
We came in too rich. I told you that.

102
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,360
把多余的燃料排出去就行 艾莉 引擎自己会调整的
- Just discharge the excess, Alex. She'll rebalance.

103
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,200
若再继续排放燃料 我们就会启动不了了
If I discharge any more, we won't be able to get going again.

104
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,870
我们必须放弃行动 让他回来
We have to abort. Pull him in.

105
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,330
别听她的 雷顿 她能调整好空燃比的
She's wrong, Layton. She can ride the levels.

106
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,460
再给我十分钟
Ten more minutes.

107
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,130
我们在大量耗费燃料 我们得马上启程
- We're burning up. We need to go right now.

108
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,670
尽你所能稳住引擎
Do what you can.

109
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,630
我跟他说了空燃比太小
- I told him we came in too rich.

110
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,220
好吧
Okay.

111
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,010
一切尽在掌握之中
Everything's under control.

112
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,390
本 你继续完成任务 好吗 
- Ben, just stay on task. Okay?

113
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,240
嗨
Hey.

114
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,660
她今天早上发过脾气吗 
She touchy this morning?

115
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,370
非常尖酸刻薄
- Scathing. So mean.

116
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,620
-赛克斯马上就到 -很好
- Sykes is on her way. - Great.

117
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,500
我们为什么又停下了 
Why have we stopped again?

118
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,050
他们找不到绿洲的 这你很清楚
You know, they're not gonna find an oasis. - You know that.

119
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,220
我什么都不清楚 这样更容易些
- I don't know anything. It's easier that way.

120
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,850
跟谁都不熟 什么感觉都没有 我的囚犯 你是个孤独的女人
- Ugh, know no one, feel nothing. You're a woman alone, my jailer.

121
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,350
至少我还有你
Well, at least I got you.

122
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,430
你是想规规矩矩地在外面吃呢 还是想在里面吃 
You gonna be civil, or do you want me to feed you in there?

123
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,310
禽兽优先
Monsters first.

124
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,690
-不 请吧 -不要
- No, please. - No.

125
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,980
好了 能选的越来越少 这是今天的选择
- Okay. Today's dwindling selection.

126
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,320
我们有红酒炖牛肉
We have the boeuf bourguignon,

127
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,570
培根蛋酱意面、可怕的蘑菇鸡肉套餐
the carbonara, the dreaded chicken mushroom bag,

128
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,950
还有最后一份泰式蔬菜
and the last Thai vegetable.

129
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,450
给这些铁路强盗干活 你好像挺开心
- You seem to enjoy working for these pirates.

130
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,040
奥德丽 我只是个服刑中的战俘而已
- Just a POW doing my time, Audrey.

131
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,380
你这么配合他们 他会恶心死的
- Well, he'd be disgusted with your cooperation.

132
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,090
能别拌嘴了吗 
Can you please?

133
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,590
-如果没人想要泰式蔬菜… -马汀 给我培根蛋酱意面
- If nobody wants the Thai vegetable... - Just give me the carbonara, Martin.

134
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,800
培根蛋酱意面是最难吃的
Carbonara, it's the worst.

135
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,560
本 风开始大了 看来有冷锋要来了
- Ben? Ben, the wind's picking up. It looks like there's a front coming in.

136
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,850
收到 我这就回去
- Copy that. I'm on my way back.

137
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,770
艾莉那里情况如何 
- How's Alex?

138
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,770
艾莉 汇报情况
- Alex, status.

139
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,350
引擎没有着火
We're not actively on fire.

140
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,230
让他动作快一点
Tell him to hurry.

141
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,480
她说她听了你的建议 一切运作正常
- She says she took your advice and everything's working out.

142
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,200
这里有很多飘雪
So much blown snow.

143
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,070
有大量的风吹过这片盆地
A lot of wind comes through this basin.

144
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,370
这是好事 对吗 
- Well, that's good, though, right?

145
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,030
可能是
Could be.

146
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,750
可能是模型测到的暖点引起的
Might be our warm spot stirring things up.

147
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,520
（信号丢失）

148
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,730
-本  -本 
- Ben. - Ben?

149
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,100
-本  -本 收到请回答 本
- Ben. - Ben, come in, Ben.

150
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,310
-我看不到他了 -本 
- I can't see him. - Ben.

151
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,360
本 听到我说话了没 本 
- Ben! Ben, do you copy? Ben.

152
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,620
本 听到没有 
Ben, come in.

153
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,050
贝丝 有件事我不明白
The bit I don't get, Bess,

154
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,510
等把你们那宝贝气候模型 带回给威尔福德之后
when we return to Wilford with your precious climate model,

155
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,430
你们打算怎样 
what happens then?

156
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,350
谈判
Negotiations.

157
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,390
两列列车都想重新连接
Both trains want to reconnect.

158
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,600
没错 先谈交换人质的事
- Yeah. Hostage negotiations first.

159
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,940
用你换扎拉
You for Zarah.

160
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,940
行 然后呢 
- Yeah, but then what?

161
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,400
用你们这里的七个人 换威尔福德手里的2700个 
- Wilford's 2,700 to your 7?

162
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,150
对叛徒和偷渡者 他可不会客气
He's not gonna take too kindly to a traitor and a stowaway.

163
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,200
我怎么成偷渡者了 
How am I a stowaway?

164
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,110
我当时在自己的车厢里打盹 醒来时列车已经不见了
I woke up from a nap in my carriage and the train was gone,

165
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,580
连同我的老公和双胞胎儿子一起没了
along with my husband and my twin boys.

166
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,490
我是提尔
Till here.

167
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,370
你得把他们关起来 然后到上面来
- Yeah, I need you to lock them down and get up here.

168
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,710
-出什么事了  -没什么是他们需要知道的
- What's up? - Nothing they need to know about.

169
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,120
好 我这就去
- All right. On my way.

170
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,960
本 听到没有 
Ben, do you read?

171
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,460
好了 午饭结束 马汀 把她关起来
All right, that's lunch. Martin, lock her up.

172
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,250
-出什么事了吗  -动起来 快
- Is something wrong? - Move, go.

173
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,470
嘿 我之前看到本出去了 你们需要帮忙吗 
- Hey, I saw Ben going outside earlier. - Do you need help?

174
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,010
不用 一切都好 我们没事
- No, everything's good. We're good.

175
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,970
这就去
On it.

176
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,690
提尔 嘿
- Till. Hey,

177
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,520
出什么事了 
what's going on?

178
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,560
你们待在自己的房间里
You stay in your quarters.

179
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,730
等着机车给出故障排除的指示
Wait till the engine gives the all-clear.

180
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,400
-就这样  -是的
- That's it? - Yep.

181
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,290
-我要出去看看 -你不能去 我去
I'm going out there. - No, you're not. I'm going.

182
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,210
你们俩都不能出去
- Neither of you are going anywhere.

183
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,460
我们不能待在这里 本 
We can't stay here. Ben.

184
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,880
-本 听到了没  -我们不能撇下他
Ben, do you copy? We are not leaving him.

185
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,510
雷顿 如果现在不启动 引擎会烧坏的
- Layton, if we don't get rolling right now, we will melt down.

186
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,840
你需要多少时间 
How long do you need?

187
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,010
八分钟启动加速
- 8 minutes to get up to speed,

188
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,300
10到12分钟运行燃料释放程序
10 to 12 minutes to run a discharge sequence.

189
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,310
-很好 开始吧 -把你丢在外面吗 
- Great. Go. - And leave you outside?

190
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,310
抢修员的防护服能维持30分钟 你启动列车 然后再回来找我
- The breach suits have 30 minutes. You go, you come back for me.

191
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,650
-你得留下 -听你的才怪
- You are staying here. - Yeah. Like, hell I am.

192
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,110
没什么可讨论的
It's not a discussion, Josie.

193
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,320
如果我们三个都出了事 就没人能完成户外任务了
If all three of us get in trouble out there, there's no one left for off-train work.

194
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,490
我会确保这情况不会发生
- Yeah, well, I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

195
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,910
就这么一次
- You know, one time,

196
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,040
麻烦你改变一下习惯 服从指挥吧
just for a change of pace, you could respect the chain of command.

197
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,290
“服从指挥” 
Chain of command?

198
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,040
雷顿 这不是艘战舰 而是个救生筏
Layton, this isn't a battleship. It's a bloody life raft.

199
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,210
你得留在筏上
And you're staying on it.

200
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,470
本根本就不该出去
- Ben shouldn't even be out there.

201
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,550
-他知道自己在做什么 -是呀 追逐梅兰妮的鬼魂
- He knew what he was getting into. - Yeah. Chasing Melanie's ghost.

202
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
是验证她的理论
Her theory.

203
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,850
我们都说好的
We all agreed.

204
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,680
找到新伊甸园 再回去接大伙儿
We find New Eden, then we go back for the others.

205
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,480
万一没有新伊甸园呢 
- And what if there is no New Eden?

206
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,650
万一她错了呢 
What if she's wrong?

207
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,360
我们就跟她一起完蛋 
Guess we just all go down with her, eh?

208
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
提尔 你得负责驾驶 把我们带出这里
- Till, you're gonna have to pilot us out of here.

209
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,320
我 为什么 
- Me? Why?

210
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,030
因为我得处理这个
- Because I need to go deal with that.

211
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
什么 
- What?

212
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,910
老天
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

213
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,000
行 好 交给我了
Yeah, okay. I--I got it.

214
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,510
（勿碰）

215
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,300
（危险）

216
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,770
你那些天花乱坠的话 连自己都开始信了 你知道的吧 
- You're starting to believe your own hype. You do know that, don't you?

217
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,890
我只是在努力让大家都活下去
- I'm just trying to keep everyone alive.

218
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,980
对 我们知道 你是我们伟大的救世主
Yep. We know. Our great savior.

219
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,940
我从没这么说过
Never my words.

220
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,570
我从一开始就在末等车厢 脏的臭的我都经历过
- I was there at the beginning in The Tail, in the muck and the shit.

221
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,190
我知道你的为人
I know who you are.

222
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,110
当初是你鼓励我当领袖的
- You encouraged me to be a leader.

223
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,150
不是领导这个
- Not for this.

224
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,910
这都不是我想要的
Didn't ask for any of this.

225
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,870
机车 我们在舱门口了 打开安全闸
- Engine, we're at the bay door. Release the safety.

226
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,830
收到
Uh, copy.

227
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,460
舱门安全闸在哪儿 
Bay door safety?

228
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,090
在系统面板的右上角
System panel, top right.

229
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,780
乔西 当心点
Josie, be careful.

230
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,700
嗯
- Yeah.

231
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,950
好 你也是
Yeah, you too.

232
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,880
看到什么了吗 
You see anything?

233
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,430
他们在另一边 这里看不到
We're on the wrong side.

234
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,970
我们已经停了很长时间了 不是吗 
Well, we've been stopped for an awfully long time, haven't we?

235
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,680
-机车 我们已下车了 -好 收到
Engine, we're clear. - Okay. Copy.

236
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,850
他们下车了 
They're clear!

237
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,690
你能启动 加速到20吗 
- Okay. Take us up to 20.

238
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,030
悠着点 
- Easy! Easy.

239
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,600
这是总的合并分类帐
- This is the general consolidated ledger.

240
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,860
从中可以看到 司务长是在哪个环节 发现偷窃行为的
And you can see where the quartermaster detected pilfering.

241
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,190
巧妙地分摊到了供应链的各个环节
- Cleverly dispersed along the supply chain.

242
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,610
是雷顿的余党干的
- Laytonites, or what's left of them.

243
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,860
没错 有人在扮演罗宾汉呢
- Yeah. Someone's playing Robin Hood.

244
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,290
扎拉 你感觉如何 
Zarah. Zarah. How are you feeling?

245
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,080
-非常庞大 我挺好 谢谢关心 -很好…
Enormous. - I'm fine, thank you. Oh, good.

246
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,380
哈维 我拿到了工程部的报告
- I have the engineering report, Javi.

247
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,420
-给我吧 -我们来听她说吧
- I'll take that. - Let's hear it from her.

248
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,590
扎拉 我很欣赏你传递坏消息的方式
I appreciate how you deliver bad news, Zarah.

249
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,760
你总能保持心明眼亮
Always a clear-eyed view.

250
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,050
那好吧
- So, then,

251
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,810
大部分二等车厢 和部分三等车厢的水管还冻着
your water pipes are still frozen. Most of Second and parts of Third.

252
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,350
农业区的产量又下降了 不过本周只下降了6%
And Ag-Sec output is down again, but only by 6% this week.

253
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,310
这是因为有人盗窃…
- This is pilfering. I was--

254
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,900
昨晚 43个休眠者 以及串连区的供热完全断了
- And last night, 43 sleepers and The Chains lost heat completely.

255
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,570
仍有162名乘客处于疏散状态
162 passengers remain evacuated.

256
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,610
如果我们没法同时为所有人供暖
- Well, if we can't keep them all warm at once,

257
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,990
那他们就得分批挨冻
they'll just have to be miserable in shifts.

258
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,700
抛弃头等车厢呀
We'll cut First Class.

259
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,410
不行
Out of the question.

260
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,040
约瑟夫 你已经将其弃置 都空了 又结了冰 抛弃它可以减轻负担
- Well, you did decommission it, Joseph. It's empty and frozen. - Cut the weight.

261
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,340
等我把机车和奥德丽夺回来之后 就会让头等车厢重现辉煌
- I will restore First to glory when I get my engine back-- and Audrey with it.

262
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,720
也许有其他节约能源的方法 比如选择性宰杀
- Perhaps there's another way to conserve energy. - Like a cull.

263
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,170
不行 凯文 你这个食人魔
- No, Kevin, you ghoul.

264
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,300
请教训一下他 提醒他这里是有规矩的
- Please berate him. Remind him there are rules.

265
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,720
很抱歉得让你失望了 凯文
Sorry to disappoint, Kevin.

266
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,060
除了冻断一两根手臂 我们要尽可能保证大家活着
But minus an arm or two, we keep everyone as alive as possible

267
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,980
这样 奥德丽才能活着
so Audrey stays as alive as possible.

268
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,100
-明白 -你也一样 亲爱的
- Of course. - And you too, my dear.

269
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,320
这是答应了的
- That's been guaranteed,

270
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,780
不是吗 
hasn't it?

271
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,910
再见 哈维
Bye, Javi.

272
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,660
规矩
- Rules.

273
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,250
抵抗军可没这么规矩
The resistance is not so constrained.

274
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,420
凯文 所有游戏都有规矩 有点创意嘛
Every game has rules, Kevin. Get creative.

275
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,790
军靴泰森
Jackboot Tyson.

276
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,630
你到底能不能把我调出堆肥区 
- Can you get me out of compost or not?

277
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,960
再等一周
One more week.

278
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,130
不过 趁等的时候 洗个热水盆浴怎么样 
But in the meantime, how about a nice hot bath?

279
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,720
你是在取笑我吗 
You taking the piss?

280
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,850
沐浴券 奖励你为抵抗事业作出的贡献
Bathing token for services to the cause.

281
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,810
凯文 要喝点什么吗 
- What can we do for you, Kevin?

282
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,230
给我来杯阿华田
Ovaltine.

283
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,400
我们这里没有阿华田 只有列车自酿的烈酒
Yeah, we don't have Ovaltine. We have train-made hooch.

284
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,240
好吧 来一杯那个酒
- Fine. One hooch.

285
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,030
威尔福德先生很喜欢 你们打理这里的方式
Mr. Wilford loves what you've done with the place,

286
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,040
不过 他需要你们多做一件事
but I'm afraid he needs just a smidge more from the deal.

287
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,620
打听消息 
Information?

288
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,170
抵抗军在不停地 各处讨好 盗取资源
- The subversives continue filching and currying favor

289
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,590
而他们的首领 则不断从我们指缝里溜走
while their shot caller keeps slipping through our fingers.

290
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,220
我们现在希望能找出并抓住这个人
We would like this person identified and captured... now.

291
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,350
也许喝醉的那个军靴知道点内幕
- Maybe our passed-out Jack knows something.

292
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,150
军靴惠金斯 
Jackboot Whiggins?

293
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,480
嘿 斯图 
Oi, Stuie.

294
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,320
-惠金斯 醒一醒 -干吗 
Wake up, Whiggins. - What?

295
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
你说我可以待在这里的
You said I could stay.

296
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,580
-你是负责看守水资源的吧  -嗯 怎么了 
- They put you on Water Security, yeah? Yes.

297
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,540
你以前是头等车厢的 所以你会乐意帮忙的
- You're a former Firstie, so you'll be glad to help.

298
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,120
水资源的安全出了什么问题 
- Well, what's happening in Water Security?

299
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,880
没有问题啊
Uh, you know, nothing.

300
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,460
嗯
Yeah.

301
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,720
好吧…
Um, well,

302
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,640
只是很小的问题
you know, very little.

303
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,970
-凯文需要的不多 -只需要一点线索就行
Kevin doesn't need much. - Just a little thread to pick.

304
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,560
说吧
Come on.

305
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,480
好吧 我听说二等车厢的配水员
- Well, I've heard that the Second Class Watermaster

306
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,230
在给为抵抗军效力的人…
was giving away hot baths

307
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,110
提供免费热水盆浴
for service to the resistance.

308
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,280
我们来看看
Let's have a look.

309
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,450
伤口恢复得很不错
Oh, that's healing nicely.

310
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,250
你今天涂药膏了吗 
Have you applied your cream today?

311
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,710
-没有 先生 -那就让我来帮你涂吧
- No, sir. - Well, then allow me.

312
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,350
没事的 乖狗狗 没事的 躺下
Oh, it's all right, cub. It's all right. You like me now.

313
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,060
朱庇特的事
This business with Jupiter.

314
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,350
哈维尔 我知道 用它对付人的手法很粗暴
I know she's a blunt tool, Javier.

315
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,230
可是 当你一个人 得为近三千人负责时
But when you're one man responsible for nearly 3,000...

316
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,110
光是纪律严明是不够的
It's not enough being a disciplinarian.

317
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,660
我得再用上别的手段才行
You need to add a little chaos to the mix.

318
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,910
在这里 就是朱庇特
In here, it's Jupiter.

319
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,200
在外面 就是凯文 咬牙切齿 横冲直撞
Out there, it's Kevin, gnashing his teeth and running amok.

320
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,580
哈维尔 你无法与不可预测的事情作对
You can't fight the unpredictable, Javier.

321
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,380
这就是我确保大家安全的方法
That's how I keep everyone safe.

322
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,960
总之
Anyway...

323
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,590
我希望你能看清问题的本质
I hope you see it for what it is.

324
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,300
我确实很需要你 哈维尔
I do need you, Javier.

325
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,690
好小伙子
Good man.

326
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,940
我是威尔福德
Wilford.

327
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,950
先生 我们有线索了
Sir, we have a lead.

328
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,470
配水员阿诺多雷耶斯
Watermaster Arnoldo Reyas.

329
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,980
永恒机车永不停歇
- Sí, señor. The Engine will provide.

330
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,190
清新如洗
Clean as a baby.

331
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
来吧
Come on.

332
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,080
出来吧 别着凉了
Come on out before you get cold.

333
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,170
配水员把我们的位置告诉了他们
- The Watermaster told them where we are.

334
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,170
-得换地方了 -又要换 
- Gotta go. - Again.

335
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,020
-好了吗  -好了
- Okay. - Okay.

336
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,310
-来吧 -来了
- Come on. - I'm coming.

337
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,440
这就对了 就是这样
- There you go, that's it.

338
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,070
不 我们走吧 快
- Oh. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Ruth, let's go, quick. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

339
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,940
知道了 
- All right. All right.

340
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,110
不是所有人都像你行动这么迅速
We can't all be built like a bloody whippet.

341
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,540
来吧
Come on. Come on.

342
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,210
我们得走了
We gotta go!

343
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,020
走吧
- Let's go. Let's go!

344
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,210
终点站到了 当然 这里都结冰了 通勤车不能通行
End of the line. The First is too frozen for the subtrain.

345
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,920
好
Okay.

346
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,350
天啊 这里真冷
Crikey, it's cold.

347
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,390
好 等一下
Just wait.

348
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,110
他们在这里待过 就在我们的眼皮底下
- They were here. Right under our noses.

349
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,530
背信弃义
Treachery.

350
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,870
你个机灵鬼
- Who are you,

351
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,450
你是谁 
you clever thing?

352
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,710
他们把这里的供热调得很低 一直都在零下25度
- They got it on trickle, stays around minus 25.

353
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,550
我希望他们不会找到这里来 因为这里太冷 没法生活
I'm hoping they won't look back here, because, you know, it's too cold to live.

354
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,220
我的天
Oh, my God.

355
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,350
怎么 凯文就不能把这里收拾一下 
What, Kevin couldn't put anything away?

356
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,860
鲁丝 在这里面
In here, Ruth.

357
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,990
当心头
Watch your head.

358
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,340
我找了几个同志替你布置了一下
Had a couple of our comrades gussy it up for ya.

359
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,550
看 零下12度
See, minus 12.

360
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,340
真不错 谢谢你
- It's lovely, thank you. - Yeah.

361
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,090
替我转达一下谢意
- Send my regards down the line.

362
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,510
怎么了 
- What?

363
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,390
你喜欢我这机灵的身板吗 
What, you likey that I'm built like a whippet?

364
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,140
什么呀 放尊重点
- No. Mind your cheek.

365
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,400
-谢谢你 -不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

366
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,450
雷顿先生 如果你在外面
- If you're out there, Mr. Layton,

367
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,780
现在是回来的好时机
now would be a great time to come home.

368
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,610
雪国列车 
"Snowpiercer,"

369
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,860
雪国列车 收到请回答
come in. "Snowpiercer."

370
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,490
糟糕
Oh, shit.

371
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,990
（温度：14度 剩余8分钟）

372
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,250
嘿 伙计
Hey, buddy.

373
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,330
你带上冲浪板了吗 
You bring your surfboard?

374
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,050
我想着还是改滑雪橇的好
- Thought we'd do some sledding instead.

375
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,510
兄弟 你的防护服还能撑多久 
Hey, what's your suit at, man?

376
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,470
7分45秒
- 7:45.

377
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
机车怎么样了 
The Engine.

378
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,390
别为机车操心 艾莉在处理呢 本 你有哪里疼吗 
- Don't worry about the Engine. Alex is on it. Where are you hurting, Ben?

379
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,730
胸口有点疼
Bit of pain in the chest.

380
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,350
手指和脚趾能动吗 
- Can you move your fingers and toes?

381
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,940
很好
- All right.

382
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,440
-我这就下去 -太危险了 雷顿
I'm coming down. - Too risky, Layton.

383
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,150
放根绳子下来…
Send down a rope.

384
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,820
你别操心了 你等着 我马上回来
- Oh, man. Don't worry about it. You sit tight, man. I'll be right back.

385
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,820
他们在排放燃料 
They're venting?

386
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,790
他们只是在缓缓前进 给引擎降温 我不明白为什么要这样做
They're just rolling fast enough to cool down. - I don't--I don't get it.

387
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,080
-我明白 -我觉得他们没回来
- I do. - I don't think they got back on.

388
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,290
-你在说什么呢  -都有谁在外面 
What are you talking about? - So who's outside?

389
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,130
我不知道 你觉得他们有事会告诉我吗 
- I don't know. You think they tell me anything?

390
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,590
我知道本之前下车了
I know Ben went out.

391
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,090
我从我房间的窗口 看到另有两个人下去了
- Yeah, well, I think I saw two more from my window.

392
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,630
那准是艾莉在驾驶列车 她抛弃他们了吗 
- Well, then Alex has to be driving. Did she ditch them?

393
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,100
-他们没接电话 -马汀 是时候了
They're not answering. Martin, it's time.

394
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,020
行 好 那提尔怎么办 
Yeah. Okay. What about Till?

395
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,940
我们只能先去机车 看情况再说
- Well, we'll just have to go to the Engine and find out.

396
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,940
这是怎么回事 
What's happening?

397
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,230
我们得回去跟另一列列车汇合
We have to get back with the other train.

398
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,320
如果你帮忙 我就不告诉威尔福德 你很配合他们的事
Help us, and I won't tell Wilford you've been cooperating.

399
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,160
你不是认真的吧 
Are you serious right now?

400
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
绝对认真
- Deadly serious.

401
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,080
我们必须重新连接 好吗  我们这都是在干什么 
Look, we need to reconnect. Okay? What are we doing out here?

402
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,920
我们在漫无目的地瞎转悠 我们快没食物了
- Yeah, we've been running around aimlessly. We're running out of food.

403
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,840
最后一次机会
Last chance.

404
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,800
要么回到威尔福德身边
Get back with Wilford

405
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,840
要么就给雷顿陪葬
or dig a grave with Layton.

406
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,810
那就进牢房去
Then get in the cage.

407
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,450
现在的时速是多少 
What's our speed?

408
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,040
-75公里 -好 我们交换一下
Um, 75. - Okay, let's switch places;

409
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,830
我起动冷却程序时 你得待在这里
I need you over here while I start the cooling sequence.

410
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,000
你得给这些电线配对
Okay, you're gonna match these lines.

411
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,090
蓝色接蓝色 红色接红色 诸如此类 明白了吗 
Blue to blue, red to red, and so on, you got it?

412
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,050
明白
- Yeah.

413
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,340
制动员 你得确定哦 这些线是带电的
- Be sure, Brakeman, okay? - These currents are live.

414
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,590
确定 对颜色嘛 我能行 换吧
- Yeah, match the colors. I got it. Let's go.

415
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,390
还有 我不是该死的制动员
And I'm not a freaking Brakeman.

416
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,810
嘿
Hey.

417
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,860
嘿 
Hey!

418
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,570
万一他们问起来 就说是你逼我放你出来的
Okay, well, just in case they ask, you forced me to let you out.

419
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,600
好了

420
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,120
伙计 还剩多少时间 
- Hey. Time?

421
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,750
2分钟
- Two minutes.

422
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,330
好 别担心 兄弟 有足够的时间
- All right, not to worry, brother. There's plenty to go around.

423
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,380
不多了 雷顿
Not too much, Layton.

424
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,760
别弄得咱俩都没时间了
Let's not both run out.

425
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
嗯
Hey.

426
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,970
嘿 你之前说冲浪的事 你真的冲过浪 
Hey, hey. All that surf stuff you talking, you really do that?

427
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,020
本奈特
Bennet.

428
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,400
-冲浪的事  -对
- Surfing? - Yeah.

429
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:43,700
我16岁时 在索佩拉纳待过一个夏天
Yeah, I spent a summer in Sopelana when I was 16.

430
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,080
当地人会冲一种叫“马路牙子”的浪
Yeah, the locals surfed a wave called El Bordillo.

431
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,370
-是吗  -是的
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

432
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,750
我在那浪尖上学到的 比大学七年学的都多
I learned more on that wave than in seven years of university.

433
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,170
你后来回去过吗 
You ever go back?

434
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,090
嗯 回去过一次
Yeah, once.

435
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,640
-再去的时候 海平面已上升… -好
By then, the rising sea levels

436
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,810
…改变了海岸线
changed the coastline.

437
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,930
海浪没有了
The wave was gone.

438
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,650
我们该往回开了吧 
- Shouldn't we start going back?

439
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,480
空燃比还是太低
We're still too rich.

440
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,150
-那要等多久  -我不知道 
- Well, how long? - I don't--I don't know.

441
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,200
嘿 艾莉 你能处理好的
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, Alex, you can do this.

442
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,700
-好吗  -我不行
- Okay? - I can't.

443
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,490
如果换作梅兰妮 她会怎么做 
What would Melanie do?

444
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,540
她会直接知道答案
- She would just know the answer. That's what she would do.

445
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,580
好吧 那…
Okay, fine, then.

446
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,590
如果换了是本呢 
What would--What would Ben do?

447
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,460
他会拿上纸和笔 边画边解释给你听
- He would grab a pen and paper and start mansplaining.

448
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,420
好 很好 那就大声把问题列出来吧
- Okay, good. Just--just talk it out, then.

449
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,100
当初设计这引擎 是为了在负载下高速行驶
- Built to work at speed, under load,

450
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,100
但我们既没负载也没速度
but we have neither.

451
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,230
它成了被困在玩具车上的喷气发动机
We're a jet engine strapped to a toy wagon.

452
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,770
我们只需急刹车两次
All we have to do is stop on a dime

453
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,070
确保不抛锚 也不耗尽燃料 其中一次反向即可
without stalling or burning up twice and once in reverse.

454
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,160
提尔 我们有三分钟的时间 可以倒回去接他们
All right, Till, there's a three-minute window to reverse back to them.

455
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,910
你一直在躲着我吗 
Have you been avoiding me?

456
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,210
我让他们把你关在冷藏室里
- I told them to lock you in the meat locker.

457
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,960
他们觉得关在图书馆更安全 如今看来 安全个屁
They thought the library was more secure. So much for that.

458
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,540
他们都在外面吗 
Are they all outside?

459
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,340
奥德丽 我现在有点忙
- I'm a bit busy right now, Audrey.

460
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,460
我能看得出来
Well, I can see that.

461
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,640
看呀 看看我有什么
Look. Look. Look, what I have.

462
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,180
看啊
Look!

463
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,600
他们抓我当人质时 它就在我身上了
I had it on me when they took me hostage.

464
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,940
我等了六个月 就为了这一刻
I have been waiting six months for this moment.

465
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,330
现在 让我们谈谈 回去找“爹地”的事吧
Now let's talk about going home to Daddy.

466
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,370
抓紧了 我们到上面见 乔西 开始拉吧
- Hold on tight, buddy. I'll see you up there. - Josie, let's go.

467
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,000
好了 本
All right, Ben.

468
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,740
可以了
Here you go.

469
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,370
好 本 就差一点了 成了
All right. Nearly there, Ben. Nearly there. There, it's done.

470
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,240
你上来了 好了
Over the edge, that's it.

471
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,080
乔西 把开关扔给我 把他送回去
- Josie, throw me the switch and start back with him.

472
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:27,090
-不行 你不上来 我们不走 -他快不行了 快走 我会赶上的
- No, not till you're out of there. He's fading, Josie. Get going. I'll catch up.

473
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,090
-你的防护服还能撑多久  -足够久 别担心
What's your suit at? - Plenty. Don't worry about it.

474
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,180
我随后就回去
I'm right behind you.

475
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,930
好了
Okay.

476
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,870
（防护服温度：11度 剩余时间：7分21秒）

477
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,450

484
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,170
你妈死了 艾莉
- Your mother didn't make it, Alex.

485
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,720
外面有绿洲的那个想法 也随她而去了
And that idea of an oasis out there died with her.

486
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,020
没有随她而去
No, it hasn't.

487
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,980
我觉得如果你们发现了什么的话
- Well, I think you would all be getting along much better

488
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,600
你们几个的关系会好很多
if you discovered anything.

489
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,980
你根本不知道我们发现了什么
- Well, you have no idea what we've discovered.

490
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,790
威尔福德有解决方法 艾莉
- Wilford has the answers, Alex.

491
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:19,340
继续开 就能解决一切问题
Just keep going, and you solve everything.

492
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,890
继续开就是
Just keep going.

493
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,120
不 不要 
No, don't.

494
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,280
离她远点
Get away from her.

495
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,450
艾莉 我们得回去
Alex, you gotta go back.

496
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,870
往前开 艾莉 回他那里去
- Ahead, Alex. Back home to him.

497
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,080
我们不能把他们丢在外面
- We can't leave them out there.

498
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,500
什么烂好人 艾莉 别听她的
- Don't listen to her bleeding heart, Alex.

499
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,590
学一学约瑟夫 算算存活率
Just do the calculus of survival like Joseph would.

500
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,710
够了 你们俩都闭嘴 
- Stop! Both of you, just stop!

501
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,380
见鬼 
Shit.

502
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,680
只管继续往前开 
Just go ahead!

503
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,480
艾莉
Alex.

504
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,030
-把列车停下 -万一她是对的怎么办 
Alex, stop the train. What if she was right?

505
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,860
-万一威尔福德是最好的选择呢  -他不是
What if Wilford is the best bet? - He's not.

506
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,450
梅兰妮才是
Melanie is.

507
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,950
好吗 我们可以熬过这一关的 艾莉
Okay? We can get through this, Alex.

508
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,330
别选错了方向
Don't tip it the wrong way.

509
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,210
好吗 好
Okay? Yeah.

510
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,280
（防护服温度 零下38度 充电中）

谁不想洗个舒适的热水澡呢 
- Wouldn't we all love a nice warm bath?

537
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:29,150
这两个家伙为了抵抗军 从你们这里窃取了热水
These two stole hot water resources from you for the resistance.

538
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,570
因为他们要干净…
Because they had to be clean...
