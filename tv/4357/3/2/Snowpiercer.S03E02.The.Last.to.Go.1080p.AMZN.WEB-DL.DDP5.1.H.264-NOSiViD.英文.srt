1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,400
When the cold comes for you,

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,570
the blood stops running to your limbs.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,860
It pools up inside to keep your organs warm.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,950
My first love told me that.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,580
An offshore roughnecker he was. Tall and lean, and tough as whitleather.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,870
He'd say, "Ruthie, your smile keeps me warm."

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,000
"So be sure to wear it till I'm home."

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,250
- Let's go. - Right.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,180
- Move it. - Okay.

10
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,960
Uh, yeah, that was some shit.

11
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,650
Next, the cold comes for your mind.

12
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,150
And after that, your will.

13
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,280
And yet still,

14
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,700
the heart fights on.

15
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,870
Ruth.

16
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,510
She says Wilford's up to something in the back.

17
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,760
♪ Ain't no sunshine when she's gone ♪

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,230
♪ It's not warm when she's away ♪

19
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,230
♪ Ain't no sunshine When she's gone ♪

20
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,150
♪ And she's always gone too long ♪

21
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,160
♪ Anytime she goes away ♪

22
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,530
Big day, friends.

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,950
- Big day, sir. - Everything's ready for the test.

24
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,960
Dear, poor Dr. Headwood.

25
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,000
How are you doing without our dear, poor Dr. Headwood?

26
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,880
I feel he's still with us, sir.

27
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,800
Are you confident here, in his shoes as it were?

28
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,800
Hundred percent.

29
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,260
Yes, how is this for the occasion? It's very, um, Manhattan Project.

30
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,810
Fine, fine.

31
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,520
Put down the lint brush and hand me my towel.

32
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,190
Pardon me. We do have much to do.

33
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,690
Thank you.

34
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,150
He left me too soon, my roughneck love.

35
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,160
His rig went down with every man aboard.

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,160
I know my smile kept him warm as he floated, all alone.

37
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,290
Just as I know our hearts will be the last thing to go

38
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,420
on Wilford's train.

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,130
1,023 cars long.

40
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,420
She's, um, dehydrated, malnourished, her blood pressure's low.

41
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,760
Hey. You wanna talk about what happened out there?

42
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,100
Yeah, when you two almost died.

43
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,770
No, when we kissed.

44
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,940
I got a baby on the way, and I made a promise to Zarah.

45
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,360
- I don't need to talk about it. - No, me either.

46
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,450
Ben's got the data. Shall we see if it's been worth it?

47
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,860
Yeah. Yes.

48
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,000
I still don't get how it's possible to survive eight years out there.

49
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,250
You freeze yourself in.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,590
Live off the residual power as the reactor cools.

51
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,340
It's kind of genius if you ask me.

52
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,090
It's not even why you went out there in the first place.

53
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,010
No.

54
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,640
We have our results.

55
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,890
Guessing that grimace isn't just from the ribs.

56
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,890
More of the same.

57
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,440
Analysis shows location is warming,

58
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,320
but the trend isn't steep enough to be habitable yet.

59
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,900
How long are we talking, Ben?

60
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,400
- A century? - Give or take.

61
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,950
Well, that's O-for-five on this milk run.

62
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,200
Okay, that leaves one more location.

63
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,830
Your Arabian warm spot.

64
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,580
Yeah. From all the data we've collected so far,

65
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,540
it looks actually pretty promising.

66
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,710
Located here, Horn of Africa, southern Arabian Peninsula.

67
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,670
We haven't enough food to get there.

68
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,090
- We've got another mouth to feed. - It's time to get our train back.

69
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,800
We find them, reconnect to the train, we lead everybody to the new hot spot.

70
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,470
I'm far less concerned with taking her, than keeping her.

71
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,890
She's right. We're going back empty-handed.

72
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,560
- No proof of New Eden.

73
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,560
- No Melanie.

74
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,730
We're not empty-handed.

75
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,860
Far from it.

76
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,530
Hey.

77
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,120
Come on. Hey.

78
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,130
Okay. No, it's okay. I got it.

79
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,340
Hey, no, you're all right. Hey, you're all right.

80
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,090
Look, you don't need the suit here. See?

81
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,760
It's all right, yeah.

82
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,350
Uh, hi.

83
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,220
My name's Andre Layton.

84
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,980
We kind of met already, uh, fighting in the nuclear plant.

85
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,150
You remember that? I'm sorry, do you speak English?

86
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,820
Yeah?

87
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,320
Here.

88
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,870
Okay.

89
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,580
All right?

90
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,250
What's your name?

91
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,170
- Asha. - Asha.

92
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,250
Great.

93
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,090
Don't worry, you're safe here.

94
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,430
No one's gonna hurt you, you're on Snowpiercer.

95
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,100
Snowpiercer?

96
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,060
Not unless we all are.

97
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,270
- The train survived? - Let me show you. Can you walk?

98
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,110
Just up here.

99
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,620
Who is that? You lost the privilege to ask questions.

100
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Oh, come on, Bess. Were they outside?

101
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,160
How's your head? Bet it hurts.

102
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,210
Not as bad as when you broke my nose.

103
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,630
Where's Mr. Wilford, the Great Engineer?

104
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,090
Uh, yeah, we don't know. There's two trains now.

105
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,550
There's a woman in a cage.

106
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,220
It's a long, complicated story. You've got one too, and I wanna hear it,

107
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,680
but it's better to take one thing at a time right now, trust me.

108
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,390
Why should I trust any of this?

109
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,030
Welcome aboard, Asha.

110
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,010
Ten percent should give us a nice jolt. Nothing too lethal.

111
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,970
An appropriate test level, sir.

112
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,060
And the decommissioned First Class cars

113
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,350
should provide the necessary buffer from the EMP pulse.

114
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,360
Well, let's hear her sing, Kevin.

115
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,320
Commence trial. Ten percent.

116
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,030
Confirmed, ten percent.

117
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,570
Initiate countdown.

118
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,990
Initiate countdown.

119
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,280
We're all clear.

120
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,080
Initiating countdown.

121
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,200
Two minutes.

122
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,880
Brought your little friend back.

123
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,180
Shouldn't we get out of here?

124
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,860
I'd wager that it's a weapon.

125
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,200
It's set in the very last car, right where the trains need to reconnect.

126
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,790
Are you sure it's not just a heater?

127
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,290
- You all right? - Yes, thanks. I'm just cold.

128
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,800
That's why you can't be running around out there.

129
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,470
We can't afford to lose you.

130
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,760
I'm no use to anyone hiding in a hole, am I?

131
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,060
And in five, four,

132
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,730
It's all right.

133
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
What was that?

134
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,570
Felt like some electrical wave went through me.

135
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,570
I think that was the thing.

136
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,000
Well done, Kevin. Well done, crew.

137
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,670
Yes!

138
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,550
I wanna remember this.

139
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,190
it's a mean old world,

140
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,610
but with you in it,

141
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,030
it finally makes sense.

142
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
Lilah Junior,

143
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,780
will you marry me?

144
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,120
Holy shit, that rock is huge!

145
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,040
I know. It's actually crazy. It's probably the biggest diamond left in the world.

146
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,410
- All it cost was a pair of heavy socks. - Put it on me.

147
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,500
You gotta say yes first.

148
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,630
Yes, yes.

149
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,260
I didn't think anyone would love me after my parents died.

150
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,970
I know, baby. I know.

151
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,270
We have to tell Wilford.

152
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,560
Really?

153
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
Yes. Out of respect.

154
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,480
After you now.

155
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,150
Okay.

156
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,490
Lilah Junior and Mr. Osweiller are here to see you.

157
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,660
Ah, bring them.

158
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,240
- He's wearing a tie. - Mmm?

159
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,540
My young denizens of the Nightcar.

160
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,960
- Could we have a word in private-- - We're getting married.

161
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,340
- What? - We wanted you to be the first to know.

162
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,260
LJ, my dear, what a surprise.

163
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,220
Very wise to put such a nice ring on her finger, Mr. Osweiller.

164
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,970
When was the last time we had a wedding?

165
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,180
This is quite the occasion.

166
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,100
Perhaps just the occasion the train needs.

167
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,020
No, we're not expecting anything.

168
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,600
- We don't even-- - I am.

169
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,320
And you should, my dear. Life's been so bloody dreary this leg.

170
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,530
We'll give everyone a shift off.

171
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,570
Let's remind all the grumblers what unity looks like.

172
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,370
That we're all in this together, and loyalty is rewarded.

173
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,990
- What do you think?

174
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,660
- We could all use a little respite.

175
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,540
- Maybe an extra ration or-- - Wonderful. Tomorrow then.

176
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,290
Tomorrow?

177
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,960
Yeah. Why not? No time for cold feet.

178
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,880
We'll transform the Nightcar, LJ.

179
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,590
Or should I say, Mrs. Osweiller?

180
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,060
Rolls off the tongue. I'm seeing red velvet, layers.

181
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,650
- You put the Cakemaker in Compost. - Then get him out. We're getting married.

182
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,440
Get him a shower and anything he needs from the bakery, okay?

183
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,610
Thank you. Thank you.

184
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,370
What the hell are you doing here?

185
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,590
Wilford's building a weapon. You know anything about that?

186
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,090
I know he's up to something, but no.

187
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,630
Well, Ruth saw Javi working on it, so she wants to make contact with him.

188
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,550
I told you guys, Javi won't talk to me.

189
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,760
He hasn't been the same since that dog attack.

190
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,810
Well, we all got scars. It's Ruth's call. She wants to see him.

191
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,700
Hitting the monitor does not tend to affect the satellite's geosync.

192
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,750
What it does do is make me feel better, but we're all falling out of orbit.

193
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,790
How do you find a needle in a haystack?

194
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,920
Thank God, it's only a haystack.

195
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,170
- You have any theories? - I have one theory.

196
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,220
That he is following us?

197
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,680
That's a pretty good psychological assumption.

198
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,060
If he is following us, we're back on the main line in a day or so.

199
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,230
As we came through here, our satellite coverage improved.

200
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,440
Maybe we see him then.

201
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,110
And he sees us?

202
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,030
Your mum would be proud of how you handled the train yesterday.

203
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,330
I don't really think so, Ben, but thank you.

204
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,790
Alex, we found a survivor.

205
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,620
Maybe we can hope for a miracle.

206
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,250
She's gone, Ben.

207
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,710
It's all right.

208
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,420
Hey.

209
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,750
Tell me who she is.

210
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,220
At least tell me what you're looking for.

211
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,200
What did you find?

212
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,260
Just, uh, in here.

213
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,010
I've made it up for you.

214
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,980
Josie. Josie.

215
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,700
It's all right. It'll all come back.

216
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,960
You all right?

217
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,670
Hey.

218
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,300
You all right?

219
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,430
How close you ever come to freezing to death?

220
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,060
I guess no less than most of us.

221
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,520
Is it like they say?

222
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,270
Yeah.

223
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,440
You start to relax. It goes warm.

224
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,240
You see things.

225
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,280
Okay.

226
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,700
Like, uh, trees?

227
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,540
Dragon's blood tree. Grass.

228
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,410
I could feel the sun.

229
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,250
It was the place we're looking for.

230
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,840
Well, I'm glad you came back 'cause it wasn't.

231
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,260
No, look, these trees only grow in the Gulf of Aden,

232
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,970
right here in the middle of our Arabian warm spot.

233
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,310
I'd never even heard of a dragon's blood tree before,

234
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,310
but I saw it.

235
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,400
Are you saying you had a vision?

236
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,730
- I'm just telling you what happened. - You tell anyone else?

237
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,900
- No. - Good.

238
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,530
Keep it on the rails.

239
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,160
You had a close call, something popped out of your memory.

240
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Some tree you learned about in high school.

241
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,210
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. Thanks.

242
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,290
Yeah. Okay.

243
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,170
Another day, another near-death experience, right?

244
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,170
Okay.

245
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,840
- Love you, buddy. - Yeah.

246
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,310
We're on a different tack today, Kevin.

247
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,110
A charm offensive.

248
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,280
What do you think?

249
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,490
Too much red?

250
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,530
Never enough red, sir.

251
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,780
I agree.

252
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,540
- Why'd you say that? - Say what?

253
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,250
What?

254
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,370
"Folger-Osweiller."

255
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,960
I just said it. I didn't know he'd put it on the register.

256
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,920
Yeah, well, it's his wedding now.

257
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,840
- I knew he'd do this. - So what?

258
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,130
We get to be king and queen of everything for a day.

259
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,720
He's using us, LJ.

260
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,300
He's investing in us.

261
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,560
I would've been very happy with something small.

262
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,390
Sing you a song, a few of us. That wasn't on the table, was it?

263
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,850
Yeah, because we don't have any friends.

264
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,150
I wanna be in a power couple. We could run this train one day.

265
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,110
- LJ, Jesus! - What?

266
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,780
Old people keep dying off, there's barely any young people left.

267
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,030
And soon, we'll have to rule them.

268
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,990
It's our wedding day. Do you ever stop conniving?

269
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,290
- Conniving is good. - Fine!

270
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,840
Connive away! It's too late to call it off now,

271
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,460
'cause Wilford would have my head out a port, wouldn't he?

272
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,260
Don't walk away from me!

273
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,590
Oz?

274
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,900
Javi?

275
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,920
Javi?

276
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,300
You can talk to me. No one is here.

277
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,180
Engineer, Wilford wants you down in First.

278
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,470
But I'm on shift.

279
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,940
I don't know. That's what he wants, so put it on autopilot and off you go.

280
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,910
You look beautiful.

281
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,870
- It's your big day. - Would you leave it?

282
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,250
I don't care if it looks like shit. Just leave it.

283
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,460
Oh, dear. I heard the bride might be blue, but blue in the face?

284
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,050
Excuse me.

285
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,640
Yes, that will be best, thank you.

286
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,060
Now, now, here. Now, tell me what you fought about?

287
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,980
"You're always conniving." He thinks I'm selfish and I'm cruel.

288
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,900
I have to be sometimes, don't I?

289
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,240
It's why I wanted you in the Nightcar, LJ.

290
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,610
You're a realist. You understand someone always gets hurt.

291
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,080
Yes, it's like, I don't say it out loud, but c'est la vie.

292
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,410
He also probably thinks I'm taking over the whole ceremony.

293
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,460
Do you understand why your wedding is important to me?

294
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,670
Helps keep everyone in line.

295
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,630
Yes. They see there's only one way, the way I do things.

296
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,430
You see, on the train, the old laws and morality,

297
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,560
- Loyalty. - That's right.

298
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,520
Loyalty to the train.

299
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,030
Now, save the crocodile tears for the ceremony.

300
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,860
Make a show of it, for me.

301
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,120
I will.

302
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,330
See you soon.

303
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,210
Lovely spot for your wedding bed.

304
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,430
Thank you. We, uh, did it ourselves.

305
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,350
Come.

306
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,600
Sit down. Come on.

307
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,980
Young, tumultuous love, I know it well.

308
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,570
Well, the tumultuous part, not the young bit anymore.

309
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,660
But LJ's upset.

310
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,120
Pre-wedding jitters.

311
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,670
We'll be fine. Yeah.

312
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,000
Well, I am rather protective of her.

313
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,760
So I had a long look at Mr. Roche's personnel records,

314
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,090
and you were an opportunistic boy in blue.

315
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,640
Well, ran a few side hustles. Yes, sir.

316
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,930
Ah, an entrepreneur with a vicious streak.

317
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,650
Good qualities in a Nightcar manager.

318
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,620
play piano so beautifully.

319
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,540
Part of you just yearns to be an artiste,

320
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,660
warbling the saddest of songs.

321
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,460
Well, I didn't grow up in what you'd call a creative environment.

322
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,920
You found your voice.

323
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
Piano man, hmm?

324
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,510
And his ginger wife behind the bar.

325
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,310
You're my team here.

326
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,520
We understand that.

327
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
We do.

328
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,940
Your Brakeman shakedown move, remember?

329
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,900
Squeeze mine too.

330
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,070
Go on. Squeeze them.

331
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,490
Harder.

332
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,910
Harder. Give them some basso profundo.

333
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,040
Now, what are your hands for, hmm?

334
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,460
Crushing balls.

335
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,510
And caressing your wife.

336
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,650
When that's done, by all means, tickle the ivories.

337
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,570
Because you're very talented.

338
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,030
I mean that.

339
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Papers.

340
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
Bag.

341
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,050
Mr. De la Torre.

342
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,010
Just me.

343
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,770
Long time no see.

344
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,190
You're on the other train.

345
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,310
No, I've been here the whole time. I've been helping the passengers.

346
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,610
Doing my bit for our friends out there.

347
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,900
You shouldn't be here.

348
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,360
Oh, Javi.

349
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,790
The thing that you're working on back there, what is it? What does it do?

350
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,000
It's gonna stop Layton dead.

351
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,170
- I need to go back to the dog, I'm sorry. - No, not yet.

352
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,720
Tell me how it works.

353
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,310
- No. No! No! - Javi? Javi!

354
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,820
Gorgeous.

355
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,880
Welcome, brave passengers, workers, all now.

356
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,720
It's my great pleasure to pause our labors,

357
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,050
and spend time in union.

358
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,470
The union today by marriage,

359
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,230
of Lilah Folger Junior and John Christopher Osweiller.

360
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,530
I know these have been cold miles of deprivation.

361
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,160
And discipline is harsh.

362
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,580
You've paid in frostbite,

363
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,500
and loved ones lost to influenza. May they rest in peace.

364
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,920
So it's time we celebrate a win, isn't it?

365
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,890
Old World matrimony.

366
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,470
Everyone, fill a glass. There's enough for every soul.

367
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,100
Extra hot food too.

368
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,270
- I'll be back. - Okay.

369
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,650
Raise a glass up and down our train for Lilah and John.

370
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,360
Come on. Cheers.

371
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,450
Everyone now.

372
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,740
To our unbreakable pact with the train.

373
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,040
To loyalty

374
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,250
and your contract with me.

375
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,290
To survive.

376
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,340
Wilford! Wilford!

377
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,850
Sounds like an electromagnetic pulse weapon.

378
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,480
Never actually seen one before.

379
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,730
- But you do know how it works? - Yeah.

380
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,200
It sends out an electromagnetic pulse killing the electronics on Snowpiercer,

381
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,240
leaving Layton dead in the water.

382
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,460
So while this wedding is happening, let's try and make it not do that.

383
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,370
- You got a manual?

384
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,750
- Come on, Lights.

385
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,290
I told the lady you're good at this kind of thing.

386
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,500
Disarming EMPs?

387
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,880
Yeah.

388
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,350
What?

389
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,480
Where you going, Javi?

390
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,650
- Back to the dog. - Ah-ah.

391
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,690
Where are you coming from?

392
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,490
Final data collection.

393
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,410
Can I go?

394
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,710
Come with me.

395
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,550
Follow me.

396
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,390
You too.

397
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,650
Now, I ask you to take the sacred steps

398
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,020
in union with the Eternal Engine.

399
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,990
These four steps represent the path humanity has taken.

400
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,080
From grass

401
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,910
to ice.

402
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,750
- From ice to steel. - From ice to steel.

403
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,470
of the Eternal Engine.

404
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,140
Anyone come through here?

405
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
That dog-faced engineer's here all the time.

406
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,770
But he's in and out.

407
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,980
Well, we'll check it anyway.

408
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,020
Wouldn't this wedding be a great distraction for the enemy?

409
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,700
I have no idea how to disarm this thing.

410
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,160
Just start messing with it.

411
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,200
- That's your plan? - You're my plan.

412
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,210
Jackboots and teal coming!

413
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,130
- What? - They'll pin us back here. Let's go.

414
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,710
We gotta go. Let's go.

415
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,090
- Come on. - No. You need to keep working on it.

416
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,340
What are you gonna do?

417
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,010
I'll need to run interference or we're all stuck back here.

418
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,310
They won't keep coming if they see me.

419
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,480
Just disable it, and give Layton a fighting chance.

420
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,810
- Ruth-- - That is an order, Mr. Pike.

421
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,690
You're in charge now.

422
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,110
I believe in you.

423
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,870
Congratulations.

424
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,620
That's nice.

425
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,930
You.

426
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,430
Yes, Kevin. It's me.

427
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,810
The one you've been looking for all this time.

428
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,610
Running around like a chicken with your head cut off.

429
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,770
I'm surrendering.

430
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,860
I'm cold and I'm starving. So, come on.

431
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,320
You get to be the hero without ever lifting a finger.

432
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,200
Take her.

433
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,810
There were 34 of us to start,

434
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,610
eking it out on the plant's residual power.

435
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,490
Korean scientists,

436
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,610
foreign nuclear technicians like me.

437
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,200
Some of our families too.

438
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,870
Marauders killed about half of us before they died out. And then--

439
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,000
Marauders?

440
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,000
And then the cold or radiation poisoning took the rest of us.

441
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,420
My nephew, he was 15 years old.

442
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,720
He was the last to go.

443
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,930
He had thyroid cancer.

444
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,400
By the end, he was begging me to kill him.

445
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,230
That was about four years ago.

446
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,400
I lost time.

447
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,070
I stopped hoping, stopped thinking.

448
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,290
It's like someone other than me lived down there.

449
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,670
Then I turned my eyes on you.

450
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,420
I hate to tell you this,

451
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,750
but humankind hasn't exactly evolved in your absence.

452
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,010
You pushed past what was safe, even sane, to rescue me.

453
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,890
Why?

454
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm just glad I did.

455
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,030
We're still basically blind.

456
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,950
We had picture last time we came out here.

457
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,780
The satellites continue to degrade. - Options?

458
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,280
- Wait, there's options?

459
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,000
We go back directly to the main line,

460
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,210
where we either see physical signs they're in front of us,

461
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,080
or we know they're behind us.

462
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,170
Or we parallel the main line,

463
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,720
hoping the signal improves enough so we can glimpse them on the sat.

464
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,930
- Second route. - Roger that.

465
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,530
And, um, you picked that based on what?

466
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,820
Another vision?

467
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,030
No, I mean, there's gotta be more options off the main line, right?

468
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,450
Yeah.

469
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,680
She sacrificed for us. So now, we gotta kill this thing.

470
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,140
- Okay? - The laptop patch is in here.

471
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,890
So we can't hack the software.

472
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,780
Maybe we can disrupt the power supply, mess with it.

473
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,950
Looks like an arming sequence.

474
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,290
- It's live. - Oh, shit!

475
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,630
- I think it's at full pulse. - I can see that.

476
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,840
I can't turn it down.

477
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,470
It's not stopping.

478
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,860
I knew it had to be someone with acumen for rail logistics.

479
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,070
But to be honest, I'm more impressed with how low you went

480
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,150
to grovel it out in the bowels.

481
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,740
Well, I do try not to disappoint, sir.

482
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,870
If you'd only stayed loyal.

483
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,370
I am loyal.

484
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,540
To something bigger than you. You've got it all wrong, Mr. Wilford.

485
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,510
I hear that all the time, and then I win.

486
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,880
Winning isn't leading.

487
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,640
Loyalty isn't enough on its own.

488
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,890
It has to come with love. And not the kind that you feed off.

489
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,600
Unconditional love. Sacrifice, for each and every passenger.

490
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,850
- Oh, God! - You can't ignore love.

491
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,520
You can't predict it either.

492
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,200
We gotta get this thing out that door.

493
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,370
Year two rebellion.

494
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,200
They sealed the subtrain doors on us, but we compromised the hinges.

495
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,290
Go.

496
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,540
Here.

497
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,420
Strong Boy, get it ready.

498
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,050
Okay. Clear. Come on.

499
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,680
Let's go.

500
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,310
Ready!

501
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,770
They're preparing the port for you now.

502
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,820
I'll make sure they mount the cuff nice and high

503
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,900
where prosthetics are impossible.

504
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,030
Wouldn't wear one anyway.

505
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,080
Come on. You got it?

506
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,000
Okay, run. Run, sister, run.

507
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,470
Go.

508
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,400
The irony is, I built the ports in as an idle threat.

509
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,360
Never expected to use them.

510
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,580
You did.

511
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,450
Thirteen times.

512
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,370
I'll pay my penance.

513
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
You can have my arm.

514
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,250
- Whoa. - Whoa.

515
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,090
I wonder, what on earth could that be?

516
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,050
Electromagnetic?

517
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,390
Triangulating.

518
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,300
Well, that's the signature. It's gotta be them.

519
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,600
Yes, it is. Five hundred and twenty kilometers west.

520
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,220
They're on the main line.

521
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,230
That's a lot better than seeing them on sat.

522
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,230
Yeah? So it means Wilford can't see us.

523
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,650
We got the drop on him.

524
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,980
- Well, Wilford hates surprises. - Good.

525
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,740
Let's go give him one.

526
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,140
I built something for you.

527
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,310
Something that would have saved countless lives.

528
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,820
We could have snuffed out Layton's pirate train

529
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,900
without firing a shot.

530
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,280
Now, thanks to a rat

531
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,740
found hiding in the pipes,

532
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,410
when this war comes,

533
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,540
you're all going to bleed.

534
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,130
It's back to broadswords and shields because of you.

535
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,390
Ready when you are, sir.

536
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,810
Let's get it bloody off then.

537
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,170
They're back. They're back.

538
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,780
- Battle stations! - Let's go!

539
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,570
Battle stations, you dogs!

540
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,700
Come on!
