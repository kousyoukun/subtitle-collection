1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,400
当你遭遇严寒侵袭时
When the cold comes for you,

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,570
血液会停止流向四肢
the blood stops running to your limbs.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,860
它会流向躯干 保持脏器温暖
It pools up inside to keep your organs warm.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,950
这是我的初恋情人告诉我的
My first love told me that.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,580
他是个海上劳工 高高瘦瘦 体格强健
An offshore roughnecker he was. Tall and lean, and tough as whitleather.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,870
他会说：“鲁丝 你的微笑让我温暖
He'd say, "Ruthie, your smile keeps me warm."

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,000
所以千万要保持微笑 直到我回来”
"So be sure to wear it till I'm home."

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,250
-好 我们走吧 -好
- Let's go. - Right.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,180
-走起来 -好
- Move it. - Okay.

10
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,960
没错 那玩意儿很厉害
Uh, yeah, that was some shit.

11
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,650
接着 严寒就会侵袭你的思想
Next, the cold comes for your mind.

12
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,150
然后是你的意志力
And after that, your will.

13
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,280
不过
And yet still,

14
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,700
你的心依然在抗争
the heart fights on.

15
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,870
是鲁丝
Ruth.

16
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,510
她说威尔福德正在车尾搞什么勾当
She says Wilford's up to something in the back.

17
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,760
她走之后就没了阳光
♪ Ain't no sunshine when she's gone ♪

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,230
她不在时就没了温暖
♪ It's not warm when she's away ♪

19
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,230
她走之后就没了阳光
♪ Ain't no sunshine When she's gone ♪

20
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,150
而她总是离开得太久
♪ And she's always gone too long ♪

21
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,160
每次她离开
♪ Anytime she goes away ♪

22
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,530
朋友们 今天是大日子
Big day, friends.

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,950
确实是大日子 先生 测试需要的一切都准备好了
- Big day, sir. - Everything's ready for the test.

24
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,960
可怜的黑得伍德医生 亲爱的
Dear, poor Dr. Headwood.

25
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,000
你那可怜的丈夫 黑得伍德医生去世后 你还好吗 
How are you doing without our dear, poor Dr. Headwood?

26
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,880
我感觉他依然跟我们在一起 先生
I feel he's still with us, sir.

27
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,800
接手他以前的工作 你有信心吗 
Are you confident here, in his shoes as it were?

28
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,800
绝对有 先生
Hundred percent.

29
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,260
对了 您看这身衣服行吗  很有“曼哈顿计划”的风范
Yes, how is this for the occasion? It's very, um, Manhattan Project.

30
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,810
挺好
Fine, fine.

31
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,520
放下棉绒刷 把毛巾递给我
Put down the lint brush and hand me my towel.

32
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,190
我失陪了 我们有很多工作要做
Pardon me. We do have much to do.

33
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,690
谢谢
Thank you.

34
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,150
我那位海上劳工恋人过早地离开了我
He left me too soon, my roughneck love.

35
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,160
他工作的钻井平台塌了 所有的人都沉入了海底
His rig went down with every man aboard.

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,160
我知道在他独自漂浮时 我的微笑让他感到温暖
I know my smile kept him warm as he floated, all alone.

37
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,290
我也知道 在威尔福德这列 1023节车厢组成的列车上
Just as I know our hearts will be the last thing to go

38
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,420
我们的心将会是
on Wilford's train.

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,130
最后屈服的东西
1,023 cars long.

40
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,420
她有脱水症状 营养不良 而且血压很低
She's, um, dehydrated, malnourished, her blood pressure's low.

41
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,470
她可能有辐射中毒 所以…
She's probably got radiation poisoning, so…

42
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,760
嘿 想不想谈谈 在外面发生的那件事 
Hey. You wanna talk about what happened out there?

43
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,100
想 你们俩差点就没命了
Yeah, when you two almost died.

44
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,770
不是那个 是我们接吻的事
No, when we kissed.

45
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,940
我马上就要当爸爸了 而且我答应过扎拉
I got a baby on the way, and I made a promise to Zarah.

46
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,360
-我不需要谈那件事 -好 我也不需要
- I don't need to talk about it. - No, me either.

47
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,450
本拿到数据了 要不要去看看 这番闹腾是否值得 
Ben's got the data. Shall we see if it's been worth it?

48
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,860
好的
Yeah. Yes.

49
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,000
我还是不明白 她怎么可能在外面生存八年
I still don't get how it's possible to survive eight years out there.

50
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,250
用冰把自己封在室内
You freeze yourself in.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,590
随着反应堆冷却 靠剩余的电力维持生命
Live off the residual power as the reactor cools.

52
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,340
要我说 这办法太有才了
It's kind of genius if you ask me.

53
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,090
你当初出去 都不是为了找她
It's not even why you went out there in the first place.

54
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,010
没错
No.

55
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,220
（宜居区）

56
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,640
结果出来了
We have our results.

57
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,890
我估计这表情 不光是因为你的肋骨疼吧
Guessing that grimace isn't just from the ribs.

58
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,890
跟之前的差不多
More of the same.

59
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,440
分析显示该区域正在变暖
Analysis shows location is warming,

60
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,320
但变化速度不够快 暂时还不宜居住
but the trend isn't steep enough to be habitable yet.

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,900
那要等多久呢 本 
How long are we talking, Ben?

62
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,400
-一个世纪  -差不多吧
- A century? - Give or take.

63
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,950
已经是第五个点了 还是不行
Well, that's O-for-five on this milk run.

64
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,200
好吧 那就只剩最后一个地点了
Okay, that leaves one more location.

65
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,830
阿拉伯的那个暖点
Your Arabian warm spot.

66
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,580
对 从我们迄今为止 采集到的所有数据来看
Yeah. From all the data we've collected so far,

67
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,540
那个地方实际上很有希望
it looks actually pretty promising.

68
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,710
它位于这里 非洲之角 阿拉伯半岛以南
Located here, Horn of Africa, southern Arabian Peninsula.

69
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,670
本 我们的食物不够了 撑不到那里的
We haven't enough food to get there.

70
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,090
-现在我们又多了一张嘴 -该去夺回我们的列车了
- We've got another mouth to feed. - It's time to get our train back.

71
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,800
我们找到他们 重新连接列车 然后带大家一起去新的暖点
We find them, reconnect to the train, we lead everybody to the new hot spot.

72
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,470
跟夺回列车相比 我更担心夺回后能否保住它
I'm far less concerned with taking her, than keeping her.

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,890
她说得没错 我们这可是空手而归啊
She's right. We're going back empty-handed.

74
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,560
没有新伊甸园存在的证据
- No proof of New Eden.

75
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,560
也没有梅兰妮
- No Melanie.

76
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,730
我们不是空手而归
We're not empty-handed.

77
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,860
远非如此
Far from it.

78
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,530
嘿
Hey.

79
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,120
醒醒 嘿
Come on. Hey.

80
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,130
好吧 别 没事的 我能行
Okay. No, it's okay. I got it.

81
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,340
嘿 别紧张 没事的 一切都好
Hey, no, you're all right. Hey, you're all right.

82
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,090
听着 在这里 不需要穿防护服 看到吗 
Look, you don't need the suit here. See?

83
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,760
嗯 没事了
It's all right, yeah.

84
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,350
你好
Uh, hi.

85
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,220
我叫安德烈雷顿
My name's Andre Layton.

86
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,980
我们算是见过面了 在核电站时我们打了一架
We kind of met already, uh, fighting in the nuclear plant.

87
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,150
记得吗 对不起 你会说英语吗 
You remember that? I'm sorry, do you speak English?

88
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,820
会 
Yeah?

89
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,320
给
Here.

90
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,870
好
Okay.

91
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,580
好点了 
All right?

92
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,250
你叫什么名字 
What's your name?

93
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,170
-阿莎 -阿莎
- Asha. - Asha.

94
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,250
很好
Great.

95
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,090
别担心 你在这里是安全的
Don't worry, you're safe here.

96
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,430
没人会伤害你 你在雪国列车上
No one's gonna hurt you, you're on Snowpiercer.

97
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,100
雪国列车 
Snowpiercer?

98
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,220
我是在做梦吗 
Am I… Am I dreaming?

99
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,060
除非我们大家都在做梦
Not unless we all are.

100
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,270
-那列车幸存下来了  -我带你去看看吧 你能走吗 
- The train survived? - Let me show you. Can you walk?

101
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,110
就在上面
Just up here.

102
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,620
-她是什么人  -你已经没资格提问了
Who is that? You lost the privilege to ask questions.

103
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
得了 贝丝 他们之前是在外面吗 
Oh, come on, Bess. Were they outside?

104
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,160
你的脑袋怎么样 估计很疼吧
How's your head? Bet it hurts.

105
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,210
没你打断我鼻梁骨时那么疼
Not as bad as when you broke my nose.

106
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,630
那个伟大的工程师威尔福德先生呢 
Where's Mr. Wilford, the Great Engineer?

107
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,090
我们其实不知道 现在有两列列车了
Uh, yeah, we don't know. There's two trains now.

108
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,550
楼下有一个女人被关在一间牢房里
There's a woman in a cage.

109
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,220
这故事又长又复杂 你也有故事 我很想听
It's a long, complicated story. You've got one too, and I wanna hear it,

110
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,680
不过 目前最好是 一次消化一件事 相信我
but it's better to take one thing at a time right now, trust me.

111
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,390
我凭什么要相信这些 
Why should I trust any of this?

112
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,030
欢迎登车 阿莎
Welcome aboard, Asha.

113
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,010
释放10%应该就能引起震撼 却不会致命
Ten percent should give us a nice jolt. Nothing too lethal.

114
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,970
这个水平很适合测试 先生
An appropriate test level, sir.

115
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,060
撤空的头等车厢
And the decommissioned First Class cars

116
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,350
应该能为电磁脉冲的冲击 提供必要的缓冲
should provide the necessary buffer from the EMP pulse.

117
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,360
好了 凯文 我们来听它“一展歌喉”吧
Well, let's hear her sing, Kevin.

118
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,320
开始测试 释放10%
Commence trial. Ten percent.

119
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,030
确认 释放10%
Confirmed, ten percent.

120
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,570
开始倒计时
Initiate countdown.

121
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,990
开始倒计时
Initiate countdown.

122
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,280
都准备好了
We're all clear.

123
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,080
倒计时开始
Initiating countdown.

124
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,200
两分钟
Two minutes.

125
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,880
我把你的小朋友带回来了
Brought your little friend back.

126
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,180
我们不是该离开这里吗 
Shouldn't we get out of here?

127
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,860
我敢打赌那是某种武器
I'd wager that it's a weapon.

128
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,200
它设在最后一节车厢里 那是列车重新连接的地方
It's set in the very last car, right where the trains need to reconnect.

129
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,790
你确定不会只是一个加热器吗 
Are you sure it's not just a heater?

130
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,290
-你没事吧  -没事 谢谢关心 我只是冷
- You all right? - Yes, thanks. I'm just cold.

131
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,800
所以你不该在外面跑
That's why you can't be running around out there.

132
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,470
我们不能失去你
We can't afford to lose you.

133
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,760
要是整天躲在洞里 我还有什么用 
I'm no use to anyone hiding in a hole, am I?

134
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,060
倒数五、四
And in five, four,

135
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,860
三、二…
three, two…

136
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,730
没事了
It's all right.

137
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
刚才那是什么 
What was that?

138
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,570
感觉像某种电波从我体内穿过
Felt like some electrical wave went through me.

139
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,570
我想这就是那个武器了
I think that was the thing.

140
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,000
干得漂亮 凯文 大家干得都漂亮
Well done, Kevin. Well done, crew.

141
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,670
太好了 
Yes!

142
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,130
-奥斯 这是怎么回事  -就…
- Oz, what's going on? - Just…

143
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,800
给我一点时间 我想…
Just give me a second. I wanna…

144
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,550
我想记住这一刻
I wanna remember this.

145
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,060
LJ…
LJ…

146
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,190
这个世界很无情
it's a mean old world,

147
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,610
但是有了你
but with you in it,

148
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,030
它终于有了意义
it finally makes sense.

149
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
小莱拉
Lilah Junior,

150
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,780
你愿意嫁给我吗 
will you marry me?

151
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,120
老天啊 这颗钻石真大 
Holy shit, that rock is huge!

152
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,040
可不是 说来你可能不信 这可能是世上现存的最大的钻石了
I know. It's actually crazy. It's probably the biggest diamond left in the world.

153
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,410
-只用一双厚袜子就换来了 -快给我戴上
- All it cost was a pair of heavy socks. - Put it on me.

154
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,500
你得先说“我愿意”才行
You gotta say yes first.

155
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,630
我愿意
Yes, yes.

156
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,260
父母去世后 我以为不会再有人爱我了
I didn't think anyone would love me after my parents died.

157
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,970
我知道 宝贝 我知道
I know, baby. I know.

158
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,270
我们得告诉威尔福德
We have to tell Wilford.

159
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,560
不是吧 
Really?

160
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
是的 出于尊重
Yes. Out of respect.

161
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,980
他就像我的家人一样 我的意思是…
He's the closest thing I have to family. I mean…

162
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,480
除了你以外
After you now.

163
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,150
好吧
Okay.

164
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,490
小莱拉和奥斯威勒先生来了 他们想见你
Lilah Junior and Mr. Osweiller are here to see you.

165
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,660
带他们进来
Ah, bring them.

166
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,240
他戴着领带呢
- He's wearing a tie. - Mmm?

167
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,540
我年轻的夜车居民们
My young denizens of the Nightcar.

168
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,960
-我们能私下谈谈… -我们要结婚了
- Could we have a word in private-- - We're getting married.

169
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,340
-什么  -我们想第一个告诉您
- What? - We wanted you to be the first to know.

170
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,260
LJ 亲爱的 这真是惊喜啊
LJ, my dear, what a surprise.

171
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,220
给她戴上这么漂亮的戒指 是一项明智之举 奥斯威勒先生
Very wise to put such a nice ring on her finger, Mr. Osweiller.

172
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,970
我们有多久没举办过婚礼了 
When was the last time we had a wedding?

173
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,180
这可是大事情
This is quite the occasion.

174
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,100
或许正是列车此刻所需要的
Perhaps just the occasion the train needs.

175
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,020
不 我们没想大肆操办
No, we're not expecting anything.

176
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,600
-我们甚至都不… -我想
- We don't even-- - I am.

177
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,320
你应该办一场大婚礼 亲爱的 人生的这一程太艰苦了
And you should, my dear. Life's been so bloody dreary this leg.

178
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,530
我们会允许所有人都歇一个班次
We'll give everyone a shift off.

179
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,570
提醒一下那些抱怨的人 团结是什么样子的
Let's remind all the grumblers what unity looks like.

180
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,370
提醒他们我们是同一列列车上的 忠诚会得到回报
That we're all in this together, and loyalty is rewarded.

181
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,990
你觉得怎么样 
- What do you think?

182
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,660
稍微歇口气对大家有好处
- We could all use a little respite.

183
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,540
-或许可以多分一两份口粮… -太好了 那就定在明天
- Maybe an extra ration or-- - Wonderful. Tomorrow then.

184
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,290
明天 
Tomorrow?

185
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,960
是呀 有何不可 没时间临阵退缩
Yeah. Why not? No time for cold feet.

186
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,880
LJ 我们要让夜车焕然一新
We'll transform the Nightcar, LJ.

187
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,590
或者我该称呼你为 “奥斯威勒太太” 
Or should I say, Mrs. Osweiller?

188
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,680
弗尔杰-奥斯威勒 
- Oh… Folger-Osweiller? - Um…

189
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,060
非常顺口 我要用层层的红色天鹅绒来布置
Rolls off the tongue. I'm seeing red velvet, layers.

190
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,060
扎拉 去找糕点师
Ah… Zarah, go see the Cakemaker.

191
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,650
-你把糕点师贬入堆肥区了 -那就把他弄出来 我们要举办婚礼
- You put the Cakemaker in Compost. - Then get him out. We're getting married.

192
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,320
（忠臣大婚 ）

193
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,440
给他冲个澡 他做糕点需要什么 就去面包房拿 明白吗 
Get him a shower and anything he needs from the bakery, okay?

194
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,610
谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

195
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,160
（全列车公假）

196
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,370
你在这里干什么 
What the hell are you doing here?

197
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,590
威尔福德在造武器 你知道这事吗 
Wilford's building a weapon. You know anything about that?

198
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,090
我知道他在策划什么 但不知道武器的事
I know he's up to something, but no.

199
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,630
鲁丝看到哈维在制造那个武器 所以她想跟他取得联系
Well, Ruth saw Javi working on it, so she wants to make contact with him.

200
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,550
我告诉过你们了 哈维不愿跟我说话
I told you guys, Javi won't talk to me.

201
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,760
自从被那只狗咬过之后 他整个人就变了
He hasn't been the same since that dog attack.

202
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,810
谁没个伤疤呢  这是鲁丝的决定 她想见他
Well, we all got scars. It's Ruth's call. She wants to see him.

203
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,700
砸显示器也不会让卫星与地球同步
Hitting the monitor does not tend to affect the satellite's geosync.

204
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,750
但能让我感觉好受些 不过我们大家都不在状态
What it does do is make me feel better, but we're all falling out of orbit.

205
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,790
本 我们要怎么在大海里捞到针呢 
How do you find a needle in a haystack?

206
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,920
谢天谢地 只是一片大海而已
Thank God, it's only a haystack.

207
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,170
-你有什么见解吗  -只有一个
- You have any theories? - I have one theory.

208
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,220
他在跟踪我们 
That he is following us?

209
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,680
这一心理假设真不错啊
That's a pretty good psychological assumption.

210
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,060
我们将在一天左右回到主轨道 经过这里时
If he is following us, we're back on the main line in a day or so.

211
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,230
我们的卫星覆盖范围会有所改善 如果他在跟踪我们
As we came through here, our satellite coverage improved.

212
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,440
或许我们就能探测到他
Maybe we see him then.

213
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,110
他也能探测到我们 
And he sees us?

214
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,030
你妈妈要是看到你昨天 驾驭列车时的表现 会很骄傲的
Your mum would be proud of how you handled the train yesterday.

215
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,330
我并不这么认为 本 不过谢谢你这么说
I don't really think so, Ben, but thank you.

216
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,790
艾莉 我们找到了一个幸存者
Alex, we found a survivor.

217
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,620
也许希望出现奇迹并无不可
Maybe we can hope for a miracle.

218
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,250
她已经死了 本
She's gone, Ben.

219
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,710
我可以接受
It's all right.

220
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,420
嘿
Hey.

221
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,750
跟我说说她是谁
Tell me who she is.

222
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,220
至少告诉我你在找什么
At least tell me what you're looking for.

223
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,260
（沙特阿拉伯 苏丹）

224
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,200
你找到了什么 
What did you find?

225
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,580
（又做了一个梦）

226
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,260
就在这里
Just, uh, in here.

227
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,390
（乘务员）

228
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,010
我为你布置了一下
I've made it up for you.

229
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,390
真暖和啊
It's, uh… It's so warm.

230
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,730
-谢谢你… -我叫乔西
- Thank you, uh… - Josie.

231
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,980
乔西
Josie. Josie.

232
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,660
不好意思 我已经很久没说话了
Sorry, it's, uh… It's been a long time since I spoke.

233
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,700
没事 会慢慢熟练起来的
It's all right. It'll all come back.

234
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,290
你活下来了 我的意思是…
You made it. I mean… Wow.

235
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,960
你没事吧 
You all right?

236
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,670
嗨
Hey.

237
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,300
你还好吗 
You all right?

238
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,430
你离被冻死最近的一次有多近 
How close you ever come to freezing to death?

239
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,060
跟多数人差不多吧
I guess no less than most of us.

240
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,520
那经历跟大家说的一样吗 
Is it like they say?

241
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,270
是的
Yeah.

242
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,440
你开始放松 开始觉得暖和
You start to relax. It goes warm.

243
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,240
会看到一些东西
You see things.

244
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,280
好吧
Okay.

245
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,700
比如说树 
Like, uh, trees?

246
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,540
龙血树 青草
Dragon's blood tree. Grass.

247
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,410
我能感觉到阳光
I could feel the sun.

248
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,250
那是我们在找的地方
It was the place we're looking for.

249
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,840
很高兴你活过来了 因为那不是我们在找的地方
Well, I'm glad you came back 'cause it wasn't.

250
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,260
不 听着 这种树只在亚丁湾生长
No, look, these trees only grow in the Gulf of Aden,

251
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,970
亚丁湾就在阿拉伯暖点的中间
right here in the middle of our Arabian warm spot.

252
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,310
我以前从没听说过龙血树
I'd never even heard of a dragon's blood tree before,

253
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,310
可我却看到了它
but I saw it.

254
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,400
你是说你看到了未来 
Are you saying you had a vision?

255
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,730
-我只是在告诉你当时发生的事 -你告诉过别人吗 
- I'm just telling you what happened. - You tell anyone else?

256
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,900
-没有 -很好
- No. - Good.

257
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,530
保持正常状态
Keep it on the rails.

258
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,160
你当时差点没命了 所以记忆中的某些东西闪现了出来
You had a close call, something popped out of your memory.

259
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,240
高中时学过的某种树
Some tree you learned about in high school.

260
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,210
是呀 你或许是对的 谢谢提点
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. Thanks.

261
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,290
嗯 好
Yeah. Okay.

262
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,170
和往常一样 又经历一次濒死体验 对吗 
Another day, another near-death experience, right?

263
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,170
好
Okay.

264
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,840
-我爱你 哥们 -嗯
- Love you, buddy. - Yeah.

265
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,310
凯文 今天我们的攻势与往日不同
We're on a different tack today, Kevin.

266
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,110
我们要发起魅力攻势
A charm offensive.

267
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,280
你觉得怎么样 
What do you think?

268
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,490
太红了吗 
Too much red?

269
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,530
红色永不嫌够 先生
Never enough red, sir.

270
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,780
我同意
I agree.

271
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,540
-你为什么要那么说  -说什么 
- Why'd you say that? - Say what?

272
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,250
我说什么了 
What?

273
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,370
“弗尔杰-奥斯威勒”
"Folger-Osweiller."

274
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,960
我只是那么一说而已 没想到他会记到登记簿上
I just said it. I didn't know he'd put it on the register.

275
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,920
是呀 这下他成了婚礼的主角
Yeah, well, it's his wedding now.

276
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,840
-我就知道他会这么做 -那又怎样 
- I knew he'd do this. - So what?

277
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,130
这一天 我们将会享受 国王和王后的待遇
We get to be king and queen of everything for a day.

278
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,720
他是在利用我们 LJ
He's using us, LJ.

279
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,300
他是在我们身上作投资
He's investing in us.

280
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,560
办一场小小的仪式 我就很开心了
I would've been very happy with something small.

281
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,390
给你唱首歌 就几个朋友在场 但这是不可能的 对吗 
Sing you a song, a few of us. That wasn't on the table, was it?

282
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,850
没错 因为我们没有朋友
Yeah, because we don't have any friends.

283
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,150
我希望我们成为大腕夫妇 有一天我们可能会管理这列列车
I wanna be in a power couple. We could run this train one day.

284
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,110
-天啊 LJ  -怎么了 
- LJ, Jesus! - What?

285
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,780
年迈的人不断死去 都快没有年轻人了
Old people keep dying off, there's barely any young people left.

286
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,030
很快 就得由我们来统领他们
And soon, we'll have to rule them.

287
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,990
这可是我们的婚礼啊 你就从不停止算计吗 
It's our wedding day. Do you ever stop conniving?

288
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,290
-算计是好事 -好吧 
- Conniving is good. - Fine!

289
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,840
去算计吧 现在想取消已经太迟了
Connive away! It's too late to call it off now,

290
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,460
因为提出取消 威尔福德就会 把我的脑袋冻掉 对吗 
'cause Wilford would have my head out a port, wouldn't he?

291
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,260
别这样甩手走开 
Don't walk away from me!

292
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,590
奥斯 
Oz?

293
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,900
哈维 
Javi?

294
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,920
哈维 
Javi?

295
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,300
你可以跟我说话的 这里没有别人
You can talk to me. No one is here.

296
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,180
工程师 威尔福德要你去头等车厢
Engineer, Wilford wants you down in First.

297
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,470
可我在上班呢
But I'm on shift.

298
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,940
我不知道 他要你去的 所以设成自动驾驶 快去就是
I don't know. That's what he wants, so put it on autopilot and off you go.

299
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,910
你看上去很漂亮
You look beautiful.

300
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,870
今天是你的大日子
- It's your big day. - Would you leave it?

301
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,250
你能别去管它了吗 
I don't care if it looks like shit. Just leave it.

302
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,460
我不在乎它是否乱糟糟的 别去管它就是
Oh, dear. I heard the bride might be blue, but blue in the face?

303
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,050
天啊 我听说过新娘子会有婚前忧郁 不知道还会大发脾气
Excuse me.

304
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,640
-我先出去了 -好 那样最好 谢谢
Yes, that will be best, thank you.

305
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,060
好了 来 告诉我你在为什么生气
Now, now, here. Now, tell me what you fought about?

306
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,980
“你总是在算计” 他觉得我又自私又冷酷
"You're always conniving." He thinks I'm selfish and I'm cruel.

307
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,900
有时候我不得不那样 不是吗 
I have to be sometimes, don't I?

308
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,240
所以我才想让你待在夜车上 LJ
It's why I wanted you in the Nightcar, LJ.

309
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,610
你是个现实主义者 你知道有人受伤是难免的事
You're a realist. You understand someone always gets hurt.

310
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,080
就是 我虽然不会大声说出来 但“这就是生活”
Yes, it's like, I don't say it out loud, but c'est la vie.

311
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,410
他或许还觉得 整场婚礼都被我接管了
He also probably thinks I'm taking over the whole ceremony.

312
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,460
你明白为什么 你们的婚礼对我很重要吗 
Do you understand why your wedding is important to me?

313
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,670
能帮你管束大家
Helps keep everyone in line.

314
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,630
没错 他们会看到 只有一种办事方法 就是我的方法
Yes. They see there's only one way, the way I do things.

315
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,430
你看 在这列列车上 有一样东西
You see, on the train, the old laws and morality,

316
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,930
比旧法和道德更重要 它是什么 
they don't matter as much as… what?

317
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,560
-忠诚 -没错
- Loyalty. - That's right.

318
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,520
对列车的忠诚
Loyalty to the train.

319
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,030
好了 你这假惺惺的眼泪 留着到婚礼上流吧
Now, save the crocodile tears for the ceremony.

320
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,860
为了我 好好表演一番
Make a show of it, for me.

321
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,120
我会的
I will.

322
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,330
回头见
See you soon.

323
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,210
婚床放在这里很不错呀
Lovely spot for your wedding bed.

324
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,430
谢谢夸奖 是我们自己布置的
Thank you. We, uh, did it ourselves.

325
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,350
过来
Come.

326
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,600
坐 来啊
Sit down. Come on.

327
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,980
年轻激昂的爱情 我很熟悉
Young, tumultuous love, I know it well.

328
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,570
我指的是激昂的部分 我已经不再年轻了
Well, the tumultuous part, not the young bit anymore.

329
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,660
不过 LJ不开心
But LJ's upset.

330
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,240
是的 这个嘛…
Yeah, well, it's, uh…

331
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,120
是婚前紧张
Pre-wedding jitters.

332
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,670
我们会没事的 是的
We'll be fine. Yeah.

333
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,000
我对她有很强的保护意识
Well, I am rather protective of her.

334
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,760
所以 我好好查阅了一下 罗齐先生的人事记录
So I had a long look at Mr. Roche's personnel records,

335
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,090
你当制动员的时候 很会把握各种机会嘛
and you were an opportunistic boy in blue.

336
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,640
我经营过几份副业 是的 先生
Well, ran a few side hustles. Yes, sir.

337
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,930
一个劣迹斑斑的企业家
Ah, an entrepreneur with a vicious streak.

338
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,650
这是当夜车经理的优良品质
Good qualities in a Nightcar manager.

339
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,980
然而…
And yet…

340
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,360
这双手…
these hands…

341
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,620
却能弹奏如此动听的钢琴曲
play piano so beautifully.

342
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,540
你心里有点渴望成为一名艺术家
Part of you just yearns to be an artiste,

343
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,660
颤声吟唱最悲伤的歌曲
warbling the saddest of songs.

344
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,460
我不是在所谓的 富有创造性的环境中长大的
Well, I didn't grow up in what you'd call a creative environment.

345
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,920
你表达了自己的心声
You found your voice.

346
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
钢琴师 
Piano man, hmm?

347
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,510
你那红发妻子则负责吧台
And his ginger wife behind the bar.

348
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,310
你们是我的团队
You're my team here.

349
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,520
这点我们明白
We understand that.

350
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
真的
We do.

351
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,940
你们制动员搜身的手法 还记得吗 
Your Brakeman shakedown move, remember?

352
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,900
你也抓我的
Squeeze mine too.

353
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,070
来吧 抓吧
Go on. Squeeze them.

354
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,490
用力点
Harder.

355
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,910
再用力点 用上所有的劲道
Harder. Give them some basso profundo.

356
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,040
好 你的双手是用来干什么的 
Now, what are your hands for, hmm?

357
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,460
捏碎别人的蛋
Crushing balls.

358
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,510
还要用来爱抚你的妻子
And caressing your wife.

359
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,650
在那之后 你想怎么弹琴都行
When that's done, by all means, tickle the ivories.

360
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,570
因为你非常有才华
Because you're very talented.

361
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,030
这是真心话
I mean that.

362
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
文件
Papers.

363
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
包
Bag.

364
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,050
德拉托尔先生
Mr. De la Torre.

365
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,010
是我
Just me.

366
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,770
好久不见了
Long time no see.

367
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,810
鲁丝 可你…
Ruth? But you…

368
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,190
你应该在另一列列车上呀
You're on the other train.

369
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,310
不 我一直都在这里 帮助乘客们
No, I've been here the whole time. I've been helping the passengers.

370
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,610
为我们在外面的朋友尽己所能
Doing my bit for our friends out there.

371
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,900
你不该在这里的
You shouldn't be here.

372
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,360
哈维
Oh, Javi.

373
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,950
-我很抱歉… -不…
- Oh, I'm sorry-- - No, no, no…

374
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,580
工程师 我只是要你帮忙 拜托了
Engineer, I just… I just need your help, please.

375
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,790
你在列车后部做的那个东西 它是什么 它能做什么 
The thing that you're working on back there, what is it? What does it do?

376
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,000
它能彻底阻止雷顿
It's gonna stop Layton dead.

377
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,170
-我得回狗那里去了 抱歉 -不 先别走
- I need to go back to the dog, I'm sorry. - No, not yet.

378
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,720
你得告诉我它是怎么运作的
Tell me how it works.

379
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,310
-不  -哈维 哈维

我很高兴大家能暂停手头的工作
It's my great pleasure to pause our labors,

383
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,050
花点时间团聚在一起

384
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,470
今天我们汇聚一堂 是为了庆祝
The union today by marriage,

385
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,230
小莱拉弗尔杰 和约翰克里斯多夫奥斯威勒喜结良缘
of Lilah Folger Junior and John Christopher Osweiller.

386
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,530
我知道 最近这段行程 非常寒冷 供给不足
I know these have been cold miles of deprivation.

387
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,160
纪律严酷
And discipline is harsh.

388
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,580
你们都得了冻疮
You've paid in frostbite,

389
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,500
所爱的人因流感而丧生 愿他们安息
and loved ones lost to influenza. May they rest in peace.

390
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,920
所以 该是庆祝胜利的时候了 不是吗 
So it's time we celebrate a win, isn't it?

391
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,890
传统的婚姻
Old World matrimony.

392
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,470

402
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,340
威尔福德 
Wilford! Wilford!

403
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,850
听上去像是一种电磁脉冲武器
Sounds like an electromagnetic pulse weapon.

404
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,480
我从来没有真正见过
Never actually seen one before.

405
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,730
-但你知道它的运作原理吧  -知道
- But you do know how it works? - Yeah.

406
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,200
它能发出电磁脉冲 破坏雪国列车上的所有电子设备
It sends out an electromagnetic pulse killing the electronics on Snowpiercer,

407
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,240
让雷顿的列车无法前进
leaving Layton dead in the water.

408
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,460
那趁着这场婚礼 我们来设法阻止那种情况发生
So while this wedding is happening, let's try and make it not do that.

409
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,370
有操作手册吗 
- You got a manual?

410
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,750
拜托 光明
- Come on, Lights.

411
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,290
我跟鲁丝说你很擅长这类活儿
I told the lady you're good at this kind of thing.

412
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,500
解除电磁脉冲武器 
Disarming EMPs?

413
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,880
是呀
Yeah.

414
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,350
干吗 
What?

415
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,480
哈维 你要去哪儿 
Where you going, Javi?

416
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,650
回狗那里去
- Back to the dog. - Ah-ah.

417
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,690
你刚才去哪儿了 
Where are you coming from?

418
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,490
收集最后一套数据
Final data collection.

419
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,410
我能走了吗 
Can I go?

420
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,710
跟我来
Come with me.

421
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,550
跟着我
Follow me.

422
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,390
你也是
You too.

423
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,650
现在 我要你们完成
Now, I ask you to take the sacred steps

424
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,020
与永恒机车相结合的神圣仪式
in union with the Eternal Engine.

425
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,990
这四步代表了人类所经历的历程
These four steps represent the path humanity has taken.

426
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,080
从青草
From grass

427
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,910
到寒冰
to ice.

428
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,750
-从寒冰到钢铁 -从寒冰到钢铁
- From ice to steel. - From ice to steel.

429
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,710
从钢铁到…
And from steel to the lights…

430
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,470
永恒机车的灯光
of the Eternal Engine.

431
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,140
有人来过这里吗 
Anyone come through here?

432
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
那个被狗咬了脸的工程师常来这里
That dog-faced engineer's here all the time.

433
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,770
不过他很快就会出来
But he's in and out.

434
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,980
我们还是要进去看看
Well, we'll check it anyway.

435
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,020
敌人会觉得这场婚礼 是他们行动的好时机 不是吗 
Wouldn't this wedding be a great distraction for the enemy?

436
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,700
我完全不知道要怎么解除这玩意儿
I have no idea how to disarm this thing.

437
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,160
你就各处摆弄一下呗
Just start messing with it.

438
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,200
-这就是你的计划  -你才是我的计划
- That's your plan? - You're my plan.

439
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,210
军靴和待客部的人来了 
Jackboots and teal coming!

440
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,130
-什么  -我们会被困在这里的 快离开
- What? - They'll pin us back here. Let's go.

441
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,710
我们得走了 快走
We gotta go. Let's go.

442
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,090
-来呀 -不行 你们得继续解除武器
- Come on. - No. You need to keep working on it.

443
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,340
你打算干什么 
What are you gonna do?

444
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,010
我得去干扰他们 否则大家都会被困在这里
I'll need to run interference or we're all stuck back here.

445
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,310
如果他们看到了我 就不会进到这里来
They won't keep coming if they see me.

446
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,480
只管解除这武器 给雷顿一个战斗机会
Just disable it, and give Layton a fighting chance.

447
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,810
-鲁丝… -派克先生 这是命令
- Ruth-- - That is an order, Mr. Pike.

448
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,690
现在由你来负责了
You're in charge now.

449
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,110
我信任你
I believe in you.

450
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,870
恭喜啊
Congratulations.

451
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,620
真不错
That's nice.

452
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,930
是你
You.

453
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,430
没错 凯文 是我
Yes, Kevin. It's me.

454
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,810
你一直以来都在找的人
The one you've been looking for all this time.

455
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,610
你像只没头苍蝇一样到处瞎找
Running around like a chicken with your head cut off.

456
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,770
现在我来投降了
I'm surrendering.

457
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,860
我又冷又饿 所以 动手吧
I'm cold and I'm starving. So, come on.

458
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,320
不费吹灰之力 你就能当上英雄了
You get to be the hero without ever lifting a finger.

459
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,200
把她带走
Take her.

460
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,810
最初我们有34个人
There were 34 of us to start,

461
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,610
依靠核电站的剩余电力竭力维持
eking it out on the plant's residual power.

462
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,490
都是韩国科学家
Korean scientists,

463
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,610
以及像我这样的外国核技术人员
foreign nuclear technicians like me.

464
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,200
还有我们的一些家人
Some of our families too.

465
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,870
掠夺者死光之前 杀死了我们大约一半的人 然后…
Marauders killed about half of us before they died out. And then--

466
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,000
掠夺者 
Marauders?

467
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,000
然后严寒或辐射中毒 夺走了其余人的性命
And then the cold or radiation poisoning took the rest of us.

468
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,420
我侄子当时是15岁
My nephew, he was 15 years old.

469
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,720
他是最后一个死的
He was the last to go.

470
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,930
他得了甲状腺癌
He had thyroid cancer.

471
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,400
到最后 他在求我把他杀了
By the end, he was begging me to kill him.

472
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,230
那是大约四年前的事了
That was about four years ago.

473
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,820
在那之后…
After that…

474
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,530
我…
I…

475
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,400
我就没有了时间的概念
I lost time.

476
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,070
不再抱有希望 不再去想
I stopped hoping, stopped thinking.

477
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,290
除了我之外还有其他人住在那下面
It's like someone other than me lived down there.

478
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,670
然后我看见了你
Then I turned my eyes on you.

479
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,420
我很抱歉地告诉你
I hate to tell you this,

480
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,750
在你与世隔绝期间 人类并没怎么进化
but humankind hasn't exactly evolved in your absence.

481
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,010
你甘冒生命危险 甚至不顾理智 就为了救我
You pushed past what was safe, even sane, to rescue me.

482
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,890
为什么 
Why?

483
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,520
我很高兴自己那么做了
I'm just glad I did.

484
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,030
我们还是基本没有信号
We're still basically blind.

485
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,950
我们上次到这里时还有卫星图像的
We had picture last time we came out here.

486
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,780
-卫星信号在持续减弱 -说说其他选择
The satellites continue to degrade. - Options?

487
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,280
等等 我们有其他选择 
- Wait, there's options?

488
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,000
我们直接回到主轨道上
We go back directly to the main line,

489
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,210
到时候 如果他们在我们前面 我们就会看到迹象
where we either see physical signs they're in front of us,

490
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,080
不然 我们就知道他们在后面
or we know they're behind us.

491
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,170
或者我们可以与主轨道平行前进
Or we parallel the main line,

492
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,720
希望信号会变好 能让我们在卫星图像上探测到他们
hoping the signal improves enough so we can glimpse them on the sat.

493
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,930
-选第二个方法 -遵命
- Second route. - Roger that.

494
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,530
你刚才那样决定的依据是什么 
And, um, you picked that based on what?

495
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,820
又看到了未来 
Another vision?

496
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,030
不是 不上主轨道 我们会有更多选择的余地 对吗 
No, I mean, there's gotta be more options off the main line, right?

497
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,450
对
Yeah.

498
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,680
她为我们牺牲了自己 所以现在我们得解除这玩意儿
She sacrificed for us. So now, we gotta kill this thing.

499
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,140
-好吗  -这是笔记本电脑的连接口
- Okay? - The laptop patch is in here.

500
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,890
所以没法黑入它的软件
So we can't hack the software.

501
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,780
也许我们可以中断电源 扰乱它的供电
Maybe we can disrupt the power supply, mess with it.

502
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,950
这好像是装载程序面板
Looks like an arming sequence.

503
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,290
-它被激活了 -糟糕 
- It's live. - Oh, shit!

504
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,630
-我觉得它处于全脉冲状态 -是 我看到了
- I think it's at full pulse. - I can see that.

505
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,840
我没法把它关了
I can't turn it down.

506
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,470
停不下来
It's not stopping.

507
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,640
好吧…
Well…

508
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,860
我早知道会是一个 对铁路后勤具有敏锐洞察力的人
I knew it had to be someone with acumen for rail logistics.

509
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,070
但老实说 更令我钦佩的是
But to be honest, I'm more impressed with how low you went

510
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,150
你居然会如此屈尊 跟末等人混在一起
to grovel it out in the bowels.

511
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,740
我在尽量不辜负期望 先生
Well, I do try not to disappoint, sir.

512
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,870
如果你能保持忠诚该多好
If you'd only stayed loyal.

513
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,370
我是忠诚的
I am loyal.

514
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,540
我的忠诚给了比你更重要的东西 威尔福德先生 你全搞错了
To something bigger than you. You've got it all wrong, Mr. Wilford.

515
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,510
这话我一直听到 但我还是赢了
I hear that all the time, and then I win.

516
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,880
赢和领导是两回事
Winning isn't leading.

517
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,640
光有忠诚还不够
Loyalty isn't enough on its own.

518
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,890
还需要有爱 不是你享受的那种敬畏之爱
It has to come with love. And not the kind that you feed off.

519
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,600
而是无条件的爱 愿为每一个乘客牺牲
Unconditional love. Sacrifice, for each and every passenger.

520
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,850
-老天  -你不能忽视爱的力量
- Oh, God! - You can't ignore love.

521
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,520
你也无法预测它的力量
You can't predict it either.

522
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,200
好吧 我们得把这玩意儿 送出那扇门去
We gotta get this thing out that door.

523
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,910
-没有开门的密码 也没防护服 -我在想办法呢
- We don't have door codes or breach suits. - Uh, thinking. Uh…

524
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,370
第二年那场叛乱
Year two rebellion.

525
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,200
他们封了通勤车的门不让我们上 但我们弄坏了铰链
They sealed the subtrain doors on us, but we compromised the hinges.

526
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,290
快去
Go.

527
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,540
在这里
Here.

528
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,420
强壮男孩 准备好
Strong Boy, get it ready.

529
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,050
好 解除了 来吧
Okay. Clear. Come on.

530
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,680
动手吧
Let's go.

531
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,310
准备好了 
Ready!

532
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,770
他们此刻正在为你准备门洞
They're preparing the port for you now.

533
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,820
我会确保他们把臂铐放高夹紧
I'll make sure they mount the cuff nice and high

534
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,900
让你将来没法装假肢
where prosthetics are impossible.

535
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,030
反正我也不会戴假肢
Wouldn't wear one anyway.

536
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,080
来吧 你好了吗 
Come on. You got it?

537
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,000
好 快跑 姐妹 快跑
Okay, run. Run, sister, run.

538
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,470
快走
Go.

539
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,400
讽刺的是 我当初建门洞 只是一种虚声恫吓
The irony is, I built the ports in as an idle threat.

540
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,360
从没想过要使用它们
Never expected to use them.

541
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,580
而你却用了
You did.

542
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,450
13次
Thirteen times.

543
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,370
我愿意赎罪
I'll pay my penance.

544
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
把我的手臂冻掉吧
You can have my arm.

545
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,250
我很好奇那会是什么
- Whoa. - Whoa.

546
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,090
是电磁波 
I wonder, what on earth could that be?

547
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,050
正在三角定位
Electromagnetic?

548
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,390
这是特征痕迹 一定是他们
Triangulating.

549
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,300
没错 是他们
Well, that's the signature. It's gotta be them.

550
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,600
在我们西侧520公里处
Yes, it is. Five hundred and twenty kilometers west.

551
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,220
他们在主轨道上
They're on the main line.

552
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,230
这比在卫星图像上找到他们强多了
That's a lot better than seeing them on sat.

553
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,230
是吗 也就是说威尔福德看不到我们
Yeah? So it means Wilford can't see us.

554
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,650
我们比他有优势
We got the drop on him.

555
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,980
-威尔福德讨厌意外之事 -很好
- Well, Wilford hates surprises. - Good.

556
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,740
我们去给他一个“惊喜”
Let's go give him one.

557
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,140
我为你们做了一样东西
I built something for you.

558
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,310
一样本可以挽救无数性命的东西
Something that would have saved countless lives.

559
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,820
我们本可以不费一颗弹药
We could have snuffed out Layton's pirate train

560
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,900
就毁掉雷顿的强盗列车
without firing a shot.

561
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,280
如今 就因为一个
Now, thanks to a rat

562
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,740
躲在管道中的叛徒
found hiding in the pipes,

563
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,410
这场战争爆发时
when this war comes,

564
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,540
你们将会有伤亡
you're all going to bleed.

565
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,130
都因为你 这场战争 又将回到原始的打斗方法
It's back to broadswords and shields because of you.

566
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,390
先生 好了 随时可以行刑
Ready when you are, sir.

567
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,810
那就冻断它吧
Let's get it bloody off then.

568
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,170
他们回来了
They're back. They're back.

569
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,780
-去战斗岗位  -快走 
- Battle stations! - Let's go!

570
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,570
去战斗岗位 狗崽子们 
Battle stations, you dogs!

571
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,700
快啊 
Come on!

572
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:58,020
