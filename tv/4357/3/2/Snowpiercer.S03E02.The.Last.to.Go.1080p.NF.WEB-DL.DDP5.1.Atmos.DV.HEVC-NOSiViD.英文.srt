1
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,600
When the cold comes for you,

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,770
the blood stops running to your limbs.

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,060
It pools up inside to keep your organs warm.

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,150
My first love told me that.

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,780
An offshore roughnecker he was. Tall and lean, and tough as whitleather.

6
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,070
He'd say, "Ruthie, your smile keeps me warm."

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,200
"So be sure to wear it till I'm home."

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,450
- Let's go. - Right.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,380
- Move it. - Okay.

10
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,160
Uh, yeah, that was some shit.

11
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,850
Next, the cold comes for your mind.

12
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,350
And after that, your will.

13
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,480
And yet still,

14
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,900
the heart fights on.

15
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,070
Ruth.

16
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,710
She says Wilford's up to something in the back.

17
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,960
♪ Ain't no sunshine when she's gone ♪

18
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,430
♪ It's not warm when she's away ♪

19
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,430
♪ Ain't no sunshine When she's gone ♪

20
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,350
♪ And she's always gone too long ♪

21
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,360
♪ Anytime she goes away ♪

22
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,730
Big day, friends.

23
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,150
- Big day, sir. - Everything's ready for the test.

24
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,160
Dear, poor Dr. Headwood.

25
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,200
How are you doing without our dear, poor Dr. Headwood?

26
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,080
I feel he's still with us, sir.

27
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,000
Are you confident here, in his shoes as it were?

28
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,000
Hundred percent.

29
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,460
Yes, how is this for the occasion? It's very, um, Manhattan Project.

30
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,010
Fine, fine.

31
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,720
Put down the lint brush and hand me my towel.

32
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,390
Pardon me. We do have much to do.

33
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,890
Thank you.

34
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,350
He left me too soon, my roughneck love.

35
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,360
His rig went down with every man aboard.

36
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,360
I know my smile kept him warm as he floated, all alone.

37
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,490
Just as I know our hearts will be the last thing to go

38
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,620
on Wilford's train.

39
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,330
1,023 cars long.

40
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,620
She's, um, dehydrated, malnourished, her blood pressure's low.

41
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,960
Hey. You wanna talk about what happened out there?

42
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,300
Yeah, when you two almost died.

43
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,970
No, when we kissed.

44
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,140
I got a baby on the way, and I made a promise to Zarah.

45
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,560
- I don't need to talk about it. - No, me either.

46
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,650
Ben's got the data. Shall we see if it's been worth it?

47
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,060
Yeah. Yes.

48
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,200
I still don't get how it's possible to survive eight years out there.

49
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,450
You freeze yourself in.

50
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,790
Live off the residual power as the reactor cools.

51
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,540
It's kind of genius if you ask me.

52
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,290
It's not even why you went out there in the first place.

53
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,210
No.

54
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,840
We have our results.

55
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,090
Guessing that grimace isn't just from the ribs.

56
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,090
More of the same.

57
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,640
Analysis shows location is warming,

58
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,520
but the trend isn't steep enough to be habitable yet.

59
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,100
How long are we talking, Ben?

60
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,600
- A century? - Give or take.

61
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,150
Well, that's O-for-five on this milk run.

62
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,400
Okay, that leaves one more location.

63
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,030
Your Arabian warm spot.

64
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,780
Yeah. From all the data we've collected so far,

65
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,740
it looks actually pretty promising.

66
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,910
Located here, Horn of Africa, southern Arabian Peninsula.

67
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,870
We haven't enough food to get there.

68
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,290
- We've got another mouth to feed. - It's time to get our train back.

69
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,000
We find them, reconnect to the train, we lead everybody to the new hot spot.

70
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,670
I'm far less concerned with taking her, than keeping her.

71
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,090
She's right. We're going back empty-handed.

72
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,760
- No proof of New Eden.

73
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,760
- No Melanie.

74
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,930
We're not empty-handed.

75
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,060
Far from it.

76
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,730
Hey.

77
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,320
Come on. Hey.

78
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,330
Okay. No, it's okay. I got it.

79
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,540
Hey, no, you're all right. Hey, you're all right.

80
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,290
Look, you don't need the suit here. See?

81
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,960
It's all right, yeah.

82
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,550
Uh, hi.

83
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
My name's Andre Layton.

84
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,180
We kind of met already, uh, fighting in the nuclear plant.

85
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,350
You remember that? I'm sorry, do you speak English?

86
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,020
Yeah?

87
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,520
Here.

88
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,070
Okay.

89
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,780
All right?

90
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,450
What's your name?

91
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,370
- Asha. - Asha.

92
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,450
Great.

93
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,290
Don't worry, you're safe here.

94
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,630
No one's gonna hurt you, you're on Snowpiercer.

95
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,300
Snowpiercer?

96
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,260
Not unless we all are.

97
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,470
- The train survived? - Let me show you. Can you walk?

98
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,310
Just up here.

99
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,820
Who is that? You lost the privilege to ask questions.

100
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Oh, come on, Bess. Were they outside?

101
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,360
How's your head? Bet it hurts.

102
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,410
Not as bad as when you broke my nose.

103
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,830
Where's Mr. Wilford, the Great Engineer?

104
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,290
Uh, yeah, we don't know. There's two trains now.

105
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,750
There's a woman in a cage.

106
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,420
It's a long, complicated story. You've got one too, and I wanna hear it,

107
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,880
but it's better to take one thing at a time right now, trust me.

108
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,590
Why should I trust any of this?

109
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,230
Welcome aboard, Asha.

110
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,210
Ten percent should give us a nice jolt. Nothing too lethal.

111
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,170
An appropriate test level, sir.

112
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
And the decommissioned First Class cars

113
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,550
should provide the necessary buffer from the EMP pulse.

114
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,560
Well, let's hear her sing, Kevin.

115
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,520
Commence trial. Ten percent.

116
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,230
Confirmed, ten percent.

117
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,770
Initiate countdown.

118
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,190
Initiate countdown.

119
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,480
We're all clear.

120
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,280
Initiating countdown.

121
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,400
Two minutes.

122
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,080
Brought your little friend back.

123
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,380
Shouldn't we get out of here?

124
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,060
I'd wager that it's a weapon.

125
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,400
It's set in the very last car, right where the trains need to reconnect.

126
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,990
Are you sure it's not just a heater?

127
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,490
- You all right? - Yes, thanks. I'm just cold.

128
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,000
That's why you can't be running around out there.

129
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,670
We can't afford to lose you.

130
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,960
I'm no use to anyone hiding in a hole, am I?

131
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,260
And in five, four,

132
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,930
It's all right.

133
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
What was that?

134
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,770
Felt like some electrical wave went through me.

135
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,770
I think that was the thing.

136
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Well done, Kevin. Well done, crew.

137
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,870
Yes!

138
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,750
I wanna remember this.

139
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,390
it's a mean old world,

140
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,810
but with you in it,

141
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,230
it finally makes sense.

142
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,640
Lilah Junior,

143
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,980
will you marry me?

144
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,320
Holy shit, that rock is huge!

145
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,240
I know. It's actually crazy. It's probably the biggest diamond left in the world.

146
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,610
- All it cost was a pair of heavy socks. - Put it on me.

147
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,700
You gotta say yes first.

148
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,830
Yes, yes.

149
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,460
I didn't think anyone would love me after my parents died.

150
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,170
I know, baby. I know.

151
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,470
We have to tell Wilford.

152
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,760
Really?

153
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,640
Yes. Out of respect.

154
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,680
After you now.

155
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,350
Okay.

156
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,690
Lilah Junior and Mr. Osweiller are here to see you.

157
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,860
Ah, bring them.

158
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,440
- He's wearing a tie. - Mmm?

159
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,740
My young denizens of the Nightcar.

160
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,160
- Could we have a word in private-- - We're getting married.

161
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,540
- What? - We wanted you to be the first to know.

162
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,460
LJ, my dear, what a surprise.

163
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,420
Very wise to put such a nice ring on her finger, Mr. Osweiller.

164
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,170
When was the last time we had a wedding?

165
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,380
This is quite the occasion.

166
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,300
Perhaps just the occasion the train needs.

167
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,220
No, we're not expecting anything.

168
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,800
- We don't even-- - I am.

169
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,520
And you should, my dear. Life's been so bloody dreary this leg.

170
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,730
We'll give everyone a shift off.

171
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,770
Let's remind all the grumblers what unity looks like.

172
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,570
That we're all in this together, and loyalty is rewarded.

173
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,190
- What do you think?

174
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,860
- We could all use a little respite.

175
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,740
- Maybe an extra ration or-- - Wonderful. Tomorrow then.

176
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,490
Tomorrow?

177
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,160
Yeah. Why not? No time for cold feet.

178
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,080
We'll transform the Nightcar, LJ.

179
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,790
Or should I say, Mrs. Osweiller?

180
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,260
Rolls off the tongue. I'm seeing red velvet, layers.

181
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,850
- You put the Cakemaker in Compost. - Then get him out. We're getting married.

182
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,640
Get him a shower and anything he needs from the bakery, okay?

183
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,810
Thank you. Thank you.

184
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,570
What the hell are you doing here?

185
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,790
Wilford's building a weapon. You know anything about that?

186
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,290
I know he's up to something, but no.

187
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,830
Well, Ruth saw Javi working on it, so she wants to make contact with him.

188
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,750
I told you guys, Javi won't talk to me.

189
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,960
He hasn't been the same since that dog attack.

190
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,010
Well, we all got scars. It's Ruth's call. She wants to see him.

191
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,900
Hitting the monitor does not tend to affect the satellite's geosync.

192
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,950
What it does do is make me feel better, but we're all falling out of orbit.

193
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,990
How do you find a needle in a haystack?

194
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,120
Thank God, it's only a haystack.

195
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,370
- You have any theories? - I have one theory.

196
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,420
That he is following us?

197
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,880
That's a pretty good psychological assumption.

198
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,260
If he is following us, we're back on the main line in a day or so.

199
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,430
As we came through here, our satellite coverage improved.

200
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,640
Maybe we see him then.

201
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,310
And he sees us?

202
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,230
Your mum would be proud of how you handled the train yesterday.

203
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,530
I don't really think so, Ben, but thank you.

204
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,990
Alex, we found a survivor.

205
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,820
Maybe we can hope for a miracle.

206
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,450
She's gone, Ben.

207
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,910
It's all right.

208
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,620
Hey.

209
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,950
Tell me who she is.

210
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,420
At least tell me what you're looking for.

211
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,400
What did you find?

212
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,460
Just, uh, in here.

213
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,210
I've made it up for you.

214
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,180
Josie. Josie.

215
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,900
It's all right. It'll all come back.

216
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,160
You all right?

217
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,870
Hey.

218
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,500
You all right?

219
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,630
How close you ever come to freezing to death?

220
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,260
I guess no less than most of us.

221
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,720
Is it like they say?

222
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,470
Yeah.

223
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,640
You start to relax. It goes warm.

224
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,440
You see things.

225
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,480
Okay.

226
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,900
Like, uh, trees?

227
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,740
Dragon's blood tree. Grass.

228
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,610
I could feel the sun.

229
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,450
It was the place we're looking for.

230
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,040
Well, I'm glad you came back 'cause it wasn't.

231
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,460
No, look, these trees only grow in the Gulf of Aden,

232
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,170
right here in the middle of our Arabian warm spot.

233
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,510
I'd never even heard of a dragon's blood tree before,

234
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,510
but I saw it.

235
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,600
Are you saying you had a vision?

236
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,930
- I'm just telling you what happened. - You tell anyone else?

237
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,100
- No. - Good.

238
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,730
Keep it on the rails.

239
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,360
You had a close call, something popped out of your memory.

240
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Some tree you learned about in high school.

241
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,410
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. Thanks.

242
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,490
Yeah. Okay.

243
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,370
Another day, another near-death experience, right?

244
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,370
Okay.

245
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,040
- Love you, buddy. - Yeah.

246
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,510
We're on a different tack today, Kevin.

247
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,310
A charm offensive.

248
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,480
What do you think?

249
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,690
Too much red?

250
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,730
Never enough red, sir.

251
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:19,980
I agree.

252
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,740
- Why'd you say that? - Say what?

253
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,450
What?

254
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,570
"Folger-Osweiller."

255
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,160
I just said it. I didn't know he'd put it on the register.

256
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,120
Yeah, well, it's his wedding now.

257
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,040
- I knew he'd do this. - So what?

258
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,330
We get to be king and queen of everything for a day.

259
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,920
He's using us, LJ.

260
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,500
He's investing in us.

261
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,760
I would've been very happy with something small.

262
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,590
Sing you a song, a few of us. That wasn't on the table, was it?

263
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,050
Yeah, because we don't have any friends.

264
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,350
I wanna be in a power couple. We could run this train one day.

265
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,310
- LJ, Jesus! - What?

266
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,980
Old people keep dying off, there's barely any young people left.

267
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,230
And soon, we'll have to rule them.

268
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,190
It's our wedding day. Do you ever stop conniving?

269
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,490
- Conniving is good. - Fine!

270
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,040
Connive away! It's too late to call it off now,

271
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,660
'cause Wilford would have my head out a port, wouldn't he?

272
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,460
Don't walk away from me!

273
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,790
Oz?

274
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,100
Javi?

275
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,120
Javi?

276
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,500
You can talk to me. No one is here.

277
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,380
Engineer, Wilford wants you down in First.

278
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,670
But I'm on shift.

279
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,140
I don't know. That's what he wants, so put it on autopilot and off you go.

280
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,110
You look beautiful.

281
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,070
- It's your big day. - Would you leave it?

282
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,450
I don't care if it looks like shit. Just leave it.

283
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,660
Oh, dear. I heard the bride might be blue, but blue in the face?

284
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,250
Excuse me.

285
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,840
Yes, that will be best, thank you.

286
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,260
Now, now, here. Now, tell me what you fought about?

287
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,180
"You're always conniving." He thinks I'm selfish and I'm cruel.

288
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,100
I have to be sometimes, don't I?

289
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,440
It's why I wanted you in the Nightcar, LJ.

290
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,810
You're a realist. You understand someone always gets hurt.

291
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,280
Yes, it's like, I don't say it out loud, but c'est la vie.

292
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,610
He also probably thinks I'm taking over the whole ceremony.

293
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Do you understand why your wedding is important to me?

294
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,870
Helps keep everyone in line.

295
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,830
Yes. They see there's only one way, the way I do things.

296
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,630
You see, on the train, the old laws and morality,

297
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,760
- Loyalty. - That's right.

298
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,720
Loyalty to the train.

299
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,230
Now, save the crocodile tears for the ceremony.

300
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,060
Make a show of it, for me.

301
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,320
I will.

302
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,530
See you soon.

303
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,410
Lovely spot for your wedding bed.

304
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,630
Thank you. We, uh, did it ourselves.

305
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,550
Come.

306
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,800
Sit down. Come on.

307
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,180
Young, tumultuous love, I know it well.

308
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,770
Well, the tumultuous part, not the young bit anymore.

309
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,860
But LJ's upset.

310
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,320
Pre-wedding jitters.

311
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,870
We'll be fine. Yeah.

312
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,200
Well, I am rather protective of her.

313
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:47,960
So I had a long look at Mr. Roche's personnel records,

314
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,290
and you were an opportunistic boy in blue.

315
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,840
Well, ran a few side hustles. Yes, sir.

316
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,130
Ah, an entrepreneur with a vicious streak.

317
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,850
Good qualities in a Nightcar manager.

318
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,820
play piano so beautifully.

319
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,740
Part of you just yearns to be an artiste,

320
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,860
warbling the saddest of songs.

321
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,660
Well, I didn't grow up in what you'd call a creative environment.

322
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,120
You found your voice.

323
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,620
Piano man, hmm?

324
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,710
And his ginger wife behind the bar.

325
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,510
You're my team here.

326
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,720
We understand that.

327
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
We do.

328
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,140
Your Brakeman shakedown move, remember?

329
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,100
Squeeze mine too.

330
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,270
Go on. Squeeze them.

331
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,690
Harder.

332
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,110
Harder. Give them some basso profundo.

333
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,240
Now, what are your hands for, hmm?

334
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,660
Crushing balls.

335
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,710
And caressing your wife.

336
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,850
When that's done, by all means, tickle the ivories.

337
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,770
Because you're very talented.

338
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,230
I mean that.

339
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Papers.

340
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Bag.

341
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,250
Mr. De la Torre.

342
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,210
Just me.

343
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,970
Long time no see.

344
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,390
You're on the other train.

345
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,510
No, I've been here the whole time. I've been helping the passengers.

346
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,810
Doing my bit for our friends out there.

347
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,100
You shouldn't be here.

348
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,560
Oh, Javi.

349
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,990
The thing that you're working on back there, what is it? What does it do?

350
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,200
It's gonna stop Layton dead.

351
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,370
- I need to go back to the dog, I'm sorry. - No, not yet.

352
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,920
Tell me how it works.

353
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,510
- No. No! No! - Javi? Javi!

354
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,020
Gorgeous.

355
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,080
Welcome, brave passengers, workers, all now.

356
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,920
It's my great pleasure to pause our labors,

357
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,250
and spend time in union.

358
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,670
The union today by marriage,

359
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,430
of Lilah Folger Junior and John Christopher Osweiller.

360
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,730
I know these have been cold miles of deprivation.

361
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,360
And discipline is harsh.

362
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,780
You've paid in frostbite,

363
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,700
and loved ones lost to influenza. May they rest in peace.

364
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,120
So it's time we celebrate a win, isn't it?

365
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,090
Old World matrimony.

366
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,670
Everyone, fill a glass. There's enough for every soul.

367
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,300
Extra hot food too.

368
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,470
- I'll be back. - Okay.

369
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:55,850
Raise a glass up and down our train for Lilah and John.

370
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,560
Come on. Cheers.

371
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,650
Everyone now.

372
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,940
To our unbreakable pact with the train.

373
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,240
To loyalty

374
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,450
and your contract with me.

375
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,490
To survive.

376
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,540
Wilford! Wilford!

377
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,050
Sounds like an electromagnetic pulse weapon.

378
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,680
Never actually seen one before.

379
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,930
- But you do know how it works? - Yeah.

380
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,400
It sends out an electromagnetic pulse killing the electronics on Snowpiercer,

381
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,440
leaving Layton dead in the water.

382
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,660
So while this wedding is happening, let's try and make it not do that.

383
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,570
- You got a manual?

384
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,950
- Come on, Lights.

385
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,490
I told the lady you're good at this kind of thing.

386
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,700
Disarming EMPs?

387
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,080
Yeah.

388
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,550
What?

389
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,680
Where you going, Javi?

390
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,850
- Back to the dog. - Ah-ah.

391
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,890
Where are you coming from?

392
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,690
Final data collection.

393
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,610
Can I go?

394
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,910
Come with me.

395
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,750
Follow me.

396
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,590
You too.

397
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,850
Now, I ask you to take the sacred steps

398
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,220
in union with the Eternal Engine.

399
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:08,190
These four steps represent the path humanity has taken.

400
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,280
From grass

401
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,110
to ice.

402
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,950
- From ice to steel. - From ice to steel.

403
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,670
of the Eternal Engine.

404
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,340
Anyone come through here?

405
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,420
That dog-faced engineer's here all the time.

406
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,970
But he's in and out.

407
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,180
Well, we'll check it anyway.

408
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,220
Wouldn't this wedding be a great distraction for the enemy?

409
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,900
I have no idea how to disarm this thing.

410
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,360
Just start messing with it.

411
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,400
- That's your plan? - You're my plan.

412
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,410
Jackboots and teal coming!

413
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,330
- What? - They'll pin us back here. Let's go.

414
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,910
We gotta go. Let's go.

415
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,290
- Come on. - No. You need to keep working on it.

416
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,540
What are you gonna do?

417
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,210
I'll need to run interference or we're all stuck back here.

418
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,510
They won't keep coming if they see me.

419
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,680
Just disable it, and give Layton a fighting chance.

420
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,010
- Ruth-- - That is an order, Mr. Pike.

421
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,890
You're in charge now.

422
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,310
I believe in you.

423
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,070
Congratulations.

424
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,820
That's nice.

425
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,130
You.

426
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,630
Yes, Kevin. It's me.

427
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,010
The one you've been looking for all this time.

428
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,810
Running around like a chicken with your head cut off.

429
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,970
I'm surrendering.

430
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,060
I'm cold and I'm starving. So, come on.

431
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,520
You get to be the hero without ever lifting a finger.

432
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,400
Take her.

433
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,010
There were 34 of us to start,

434
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,810
eking it out on the plant's residual power.

435
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,690
Korean scientists,

436
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,810
foreign nuclear technicians like me.

437
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,400
Some of our families too.

438
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:05,070
Marauders killed about half of us before they died out. And then--

439
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,200
Marauders?

440
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,200
And then the cold or radiation poisoning took the rest of us.

441
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,620
My nephew, he was 15 years old.

442
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,920
He was the last to go.

443
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,130
He had thyroid cancer.

444
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,600
By the end, he was begging me to kill him.

445
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,430
That was about four years ago.

446
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,600
I lost time.

447
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,270
I stopped hoping, stopped thinking.

448
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,490
It's like someone other than me lived down there.

449
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,870
Then I turned my eyes on you.

450
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,620
I hate to tell you this,

451
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,950
but humankind hasn't exactly evolved in your absence.

452
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,210
You pushed past what was safe, even sane, to rescue me.

453
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,090
Why?

454
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,720
I'm just glad I did.

455
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,230
We're still basically blind.

456
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,150
We had picture last time we came out here.

457
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,980
The satellites continue to degrade. - Options?

458
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,480
- Wait, there's options?

459
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,200
We go back directly to the main line,

460
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,410
where we either see physical signs they're in front of us,

461
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,280
or we know they're behind us.

462
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,370
Or we parallel the main line,

463
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,920
hoping the signal improves enough so we can glimpse them on the sat.

464
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,130
- Second route. - Roger that.

465
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,730
And, um, you picked that based on what?

466
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,020
Another vision?

467
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:01,230
No, I mean, there's gotta be more options off the main line, right?

468
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:03,650
Yeah.

469
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,880
She sacrificed for us. So now, we gotta kill this thing.

470
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,340
- Okay? - The laptop patch is in here.

471
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,090
So we can't hack the software.

472
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,980
Maybe we can disrupt the power supply, mess with it.

473
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,150
Looks like an arming sequence.

474
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,490
- It's live. - Oh, shit!

475
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,830
- I think it's at full pulse. - I can see that.

476
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,040
I can't turn it down.

477
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,670
It's not stopping.

478
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,060
I knew it had to be someone with acumen for rail logistics.

479
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,270
But to be honest, I'm more impressed with how low you went

480
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,350
to grovel it out in the bowels.

481
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,940
Well, I do try not to disappoint, sir.

482
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,070
If you'd only stayed loyal.

483
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,570
I am loyal.

484
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,740
To something bigger than you. You've got it all wrong, Mr. Wilford.

485
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,710
I hear that all the time, and then I win.

486
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,080
Winning isn't leading.

487
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,840
Loyalty isn't enough on its own.

488
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,090
It has to come with love. And not the kind that you feed off.

489
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,800
Unconditional love. Sacrifice, for each and every passenger.

490
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,050
- Oh, God! - You can't ignore love.

491
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,720
You can't predict it either.

492
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,400
We gotta get this thing out that door.

493
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,570
Year two rebellion.

494
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,400
They sealed the subtrain doors on us, but we compromised the hinges.

495
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,490
Go.

496
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,740
Here.

497
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,620
Strong Boy, get it ready.

498
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,250
Okay. Clear. Come on.

499
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,880
Let's go.

500
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,510
Ready!

501
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,970
They're preparing the port for you now.

502
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,020
I'll make sure they mount the cuff nice and high

503
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,100
where prosthetics are impossible.

504
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,230
Wouldn't wear one anyway.

505
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,280
Come on. You got it?

506
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,200
Okay, run. Run, sister, run.

507
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,670
Go.

508
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,600
The irony is, I built the ports in as an idle threat.

509
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,560
Never expected to use them.

510
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,780
You did.

511
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,650
Thirteen times.

512
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,570
I'll pay my penance.

513
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,040
You can have my arm.

514
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,450
- Whoa. - Whoa.

515
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,290
I wonder, what on earth could that be?

516
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,250
Electromagnetic?

517
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,590
Triangulating.

518
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:13,500
Well, that's the signature. It's gotta be them.

519
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,800
Yes, it is. Five hundred and twenty kilometers west.

520
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,420
They're on the main line.

521
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,430
That's a lot better than seeing them on sat.

522
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,430
Yeah? So it means Wilford can't see us.

523
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,850
We got the drop on him.

524
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,180
- Well, Wilford hates surprises. - Good.

525
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,940
Let's go give him one.

526
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,340
I built something for you.

527
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,510
Something that would have saved countless lives.

528
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,020
We could have snuffed out Layton's pirate train

529
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,100
without firing a shot.

530
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,480
Now, thanks to a rat

531
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,940
found hiding in the pipes,

532
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,610
when this war comes,

533
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,740
you're all going to bleed.

534
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,330
It's back to broadswords and shields because of you.

535
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,590
Ready when you are, sir.

536
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,010
Let's get it bloody off then.

537
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,370
They're back. They're back.

538
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,980
- Battle stations! - Let's go!

539
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,770
Battle stations, you dogs!

540
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,900
Come on!
