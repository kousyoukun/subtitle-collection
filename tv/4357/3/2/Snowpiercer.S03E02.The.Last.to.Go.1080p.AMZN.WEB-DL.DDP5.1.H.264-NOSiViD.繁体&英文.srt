1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,400
當你遭遇嚴寒侵襲時
When the cold comes for you,

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,570
血液會停止流向四肢
the blood stops running to your limbs.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,860
它會流向軀干 保持臟器溫暖
It pools up inside to keep your organs warm.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,950
這是我的初戀情人告訴我的
My first love told me that.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,580
他是個海上勞工 高高瘦瘦 體格強健
An offshore roughnecker he was. Tall and lean, and tough as whitleather.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,870
他會說：“魯絲 你的微笑讓我溫暖
He'd say, "Ruthie, your smile keeps me warm."

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,000
所以千萬要保持微笑 直到我回來”
"So be sure to wear it till I'm home."

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,250
-好 我們走吧 -好
- Let's go. - Right.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,180
-走起來 -好
- Move it. - Okay.

10
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,960
沒錯 那玩意兒很厲害
Uh, yeah, that was some shit.

11
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,650
接著 嚴寒就會侵襲你的思想
Next, the cold comes for your mind.

12
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,150
然后是你的意志力
And after that, your will.

13
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,280
不過
And yet still,

14
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,700
你的心依然在抗爭
the heart fights on.

15
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,870
是魯絲
Ruth.

16
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,510
她說威爾福德正在車尾搞什么勾當
She says Wilford's up to something in the back.

17
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,760
她走之后就沒了陽光
♪ Ain't no sunshine when she's gone ♪

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,230
她不在時就沒了溫暖
♪ It's not warm when she's away ♪

19
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,230
她走之后就沒了陽光
♪ Ain't no sunshine When she's gone ♪

20
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,150
而她總是離開得太久
♪ And she's always gone too long ♪

21
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,160
每次她離開
♪ Anytime she goes away ♪

22
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,530
朋友們 今天是大日子
Big day, friends.

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,950
確實是大日子 先生 測試需要的一切都準備好了
- Big day, sir. - Everything's ready for the test.

24
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,960
可憐的黑得伍德醫生 親愛的
Dear, poor Dr. Headwood.

25
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,000
你那可憐的丈夫 黑得伍德醫生去世后 你還好嗎 
How are you doing without our dear, poor Dr. Headwood?

26
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,880
我感覺他依然跟我們在一起 先生
I feel he's still with us, sir.

27
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,800
接手他以前的工作 你有信心嗎 
Are you confident here, in his shoes as it were?

28
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,800
絕對有 先生
Hundred percent.

29
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,260
對了 您看這身衣服行嗎  很有“曼哈頓計劃”的風范
Yes, how is this for the occasion? It's very, um, Manhattan Project.

30
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,810
挺好
Fine, fine.

31
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,520
放下棉絨刷 把毛巾遞給我
Put down the lint brush and hand me my towel.

32
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,190
我失陪了 我們有很多工作要做
Pardon me. We do have much to do.

33
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,690
謝謝
Thank you.

34
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,150
我那位海上勞工戀人過早地離開了我
He left me too soon, my roughneck love.

35
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,160
他工作的鉆井平臺塌了 所有的人都沉入了海底
His rig went down with every man aboard.

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,160
我知道在他獨自漂浮時 我的微笑讓他感到溫暖
I know my smile kept him warm as he floated, all alone.

37
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,290
我也知道 在威爾福德這列 1023節車廂組成的列車上
Just as I know our hearts will be the last thing to go

38
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,420
我們的心將會是
on Wilford's train.

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,130
最后屈服的東西
1,023 cars long.

40
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,420
她有脫水癥狀 營養不良 而且血壓很低
She's, um, dehydrated, malnourished, her blood pressure's low.

41
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,470
她可能有輻射中毒 所以…
She's probably got radiation poisoning, so…

42
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,760
嘿 想不想談談 在外面發生的那件事 
Hey. You wanna talk about what happened out there?

43
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,100
想 你們倆差點就沒命了
Yeah, when you two almost died.

44
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,770
不是那個 是我們接吻的事
No, when we kissed.

45
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,940
我馬上就要當爸爸了 而且我答應過扎拉
I got a baby on the way, and I made a promise to Zarah.

46
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,360
-我不需要談那件事 -好 我也不需要
- I don't need to talk about it. - No, me either.

47
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,450
本拿到數據了 要不要去看看 這番鬧騰是否值得 
Ben's got the data. Shall we see if it's been worth it?

48
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,860
好的
Yeah. Yes.

49
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,000
我還是不明白 她怎么可能在外面生存八年
I still don't get how it's possible to survive eight years out there.

50
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,250
用冰把自己封在室內
You freeze yourself in.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,590
隨著反應堆冷卻 靠剩余的電力維持生命
Live off the residual power as the reactor cools.

52
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,340
要我說 這辦法太有才了
It's kind of genius if you ask me.

53
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,090
你當初出去 都不是為了找她
It's not even why you went out there in the first place.

54
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,010
沒錯
No.

55
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,220
（宜居區）

56
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,640
結果出來了
We have our results.

57
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,890
我估計這表情 不光是因為你的肋骨疼吧
Guessing that grimace isn't just from the ribs.

58
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,890
跟之前的差不多
More of the same.

59
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,440
分析顯示該區域正在變暖
Analysis shows location is warming,

60
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,320
但變化速度不夠快 暫時還不宜居住
but the trend isn't steep enough to be habitable yet.

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,900
那要等多久呢 本 
How long are we talking, Ben?

62
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,400
-一個世紀  -差不多吧
- A century? - Give or take.

63
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,950
已經是第五個點了 還是不行
Well, that's O-for-five on this milk run.

64
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,200
好吧 那就只剩最后一個地點了
Okay, that leaves one more location.

65
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,830
阿拉伯的那個暖點
Your Arabian warm spot.

66
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,580
對 從我們迄今為止 采集到的所有數據來看
Yeah. From all the data we've collected so far,

67
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,540
那個地方實際上很有希望
it looks actually pretty promising.

68
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,710
它位于這里 非洲之角 阿拉伯半島以南
Located here, Horn of Africa, southern Arabian Peninsula.

69
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,670
本 我們的食物不夠了 撐不到那里的
We haven't enough food to get there.

70
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,090
-現在我們又多了一張嘴 -該去奪回我們的列車了
- We've got another mouth to feed. - It's time to get our train back.

71
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,800
我們找到他們 重新連接列車 然后帶大家一起去新的暖點
We find them, reconnect to the train, we lead everybody to the new hot spot.

72
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,470
跟奪回列車相比 我更擔心奪回后能否保住它
I'm far less concerned with taking her, than keeping her.

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,890
她說得沒錯 我們這可是空手而歸啊
She's right. We're going back empty-handed.

74
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,560
沒有新伊甸園存在的證據
- No proof of New Eden.

75
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,560
也沒有梅蘭妮
- No Melanie.

76
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,730
我們不是空手而歸
We're not empty-handed.

77
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,860
遠非如此
Far from it.

78
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,530
嘿
Hey.

79
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,120
醒醒 嘿
Come on. Hey.

80
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,130
好吧 別 沒事的 我能行
Okay. No, it's okay. I got it.

81
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,340
嘿 別緊張 沒事的 一切都好
Hey, no, you're all right. Hey, you're all right.

82
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,090
聽著 在這里 不需要穿防護服 看到嗎 
Look, you don't need the suit here. See?

83
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,760
嗯 沒事了
It's all right, yeah.

84
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,350
你好
Uh, hi.

85
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,220
我叫安德烈雷頓
My name's Andre Layton.

86
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,980
我們算是見過面了 在核電站時我們打了一架
We kind of met already, uh, fighting in the nuclear plant.

87
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,150
記得嗎 對不起 你會說英語嗎 
You remember that? I'm sorry, do you speak English?

88
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,820
會 
Yeah?

89
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,320
給
Here.

90
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,870
好
Okay.

91
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,580
好點了 
All right?

92
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,250
你叫什么名字 
What's your name?

93
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,170
-阿莎 -阿莎
- Asha. - Asha.

94
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,250
很好
Great.

95
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,090
別擔心 你在這里是安全的
Don't worry, you're safe here.

96
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,430
沒人會傷害你 你在雪國列車上
No one's gonna hurt you, you're on Snowpiercer.

97
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,100
雪國列車 
Snowpiercer?

98
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,220
我是在做夢嗎 
Am I… Am I dreaming?

99
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,060
除非我們大家都在做夢
Not unless we all are.

100
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,270
-那列車幸存下來了  -我帶你去看看吧 你能走嗎 
- The train survived? - Let me show you. Can you walk?

101
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,110
就在上面
Just up here.

102
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,620
-她是什么人  -你已經沒資格提問了
Who is that? You lost the privilege to ask questions.

103
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
得了 貝絲 他們之前是在外面嗎 
Oh, come on, Bess. Were they outside?

104
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,160
你的腦袋怎么樣 估計很疼吧
How's your head? Bet it hurts.

105
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,210
沒你打斷我鼻梁骨時那么疼
Not as bad as when you broke my nose.

106
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,630
那個偉大的工程師威爾福德先生呢 
Where's Mr. Wilford, the Great Engineer?

107
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,090
我們其實不知道 現在有兩列列車了
Uh, yeah, we don't know. There's two trains now.

108
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,550
樓下有一個女人被關在一間牢房里
There's a woman in a cage.

109
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,220
這故事又長又復雜 你也有故事 我很想聽
It's a long, complicated story. You've got one too, and I wanna hear it,

110
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,680
不過 目前最好是 一次消化一件事 相信我
but it's better to take one thing at a time right now, trust me.

111
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,390
我憑什么要相信這些 
Why should I trust any of this?

112
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,030
歡迎登車 阿莎
Welcome aboard, Asha.

113
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,010
釋放10%應該就能引起震撼 卻不會致命
Ten percent should give us a nice jolt. Nothing too lethal.

114
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,970
這個水平很適合測試 先生
An appropriate test level, sir.

115
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,060
撤空的頭等車廂
And the decommissioned First Class cars

116
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,350
應該能為電磁脈沖的沖擊 提供必要的緩沖
should provide the necessary buffer from the EMP pulse.

117
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,360
好了 凱文 我們來聽它“一展歌喉”吧
Well, let's hear her sing, Kevin.

118
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,320
開始測試 釋放10%
Commence trial. Ten percent.

119
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,030
確認 釋放10%
Confirmed, ten percent.

120
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,570
開始倒計時
Initiate countdown.

121
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,990
開始倒計時
Initiate countdown.

122
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,280
都準備好了
We're all clear.

123
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,080
倒計時開始
Initiating countdown.

124
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,200
兩分鐘
Two minutes.

125
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,880
我把你的小朋友帶回來了
Brought your little friend back.

126
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,180
我們不是該離開這里嗎 
Shouldn't we get out of here?

127
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,860
我敢打賭那是某種武器
I'd wager that it's a weapon.

128
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,200
它設在最后一節車廂里 那是列車重新連接的地方
It's set in the very last car, right where the trains need to reconnect.

129
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,790
你確定不會只是一個加熱器嗎 
Are you sure it's not just a heater?

130
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,290
-你沒事吧  -沒事 謝謝關心 我只是冷
- You all right? - Yes, thanks. I'm just cold.

131
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,800
所以你不該在外面跑
That's why you can't be running around out there.

132
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,470
我們不能失去你
We can't afford to lose you.

133
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,760
要是整天躲在洞里 我還有什么用 
I'm no use to anyone hiding in a hole, am I?

134
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,060
倒數五、四
And in five, four,

135
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,860
三、二…
three, two…

136
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,730
沒事了
It's all right.

137
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
剛才那是什么 
What was that?

138
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,570
感覺像某種電波從我體內穿過
Felt like some electrical wave went through me.

139
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,570
我想這就是那個武器了
I think that was the thing.

140
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,000
干得漂亮 凱文 大家干得都漂亮
Well done, Kevin. Well done, crew.

141
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,670
太好了 
Yes!

142
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,130
-奧斯 這是怎么回事  -就…
- Oz, what's going on? - Just…

143
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,800
給我一點時間 我想…
Just give me a second. I wanna…

144
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,550
我想記住這一刻
I wanna remember this.

145
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,060
LJ…
LJ…

146
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,190
這個世界很無情
it's a mean old world,

147
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,610
但是有了你
but with you in it,

148
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,030
它終于有了意義
it finally makes sense.

149
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
小萊拉
Lilah Junior,

150
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,780
你愿意嫁給我嗎 
will you marry me?

151
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,120
老天啊 這顆鉆石真大 
Holy shit, that rock is huge!

152
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,040
可不是 說來你可能不信 這可能是世上現存的最大的鉆石了
I know. It's actually crazy. It's probably the biggest diamond left in the world.

153
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,410
-只用一雙厚襪子就換來了 -快給我戴上
- All it cost was a pair of heavy socks. - Put it on me.

154
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,500
你得先說“我愿意”才行
You gotta say yes first.

155
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,630
我愿意
Yes, yes.

156
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,260
父母去世后 我以為不會再有人愛我了
I didn't think anyone would love me after my parents died.

157
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,970
我知道 寶貝 我知道
I know, baby. I know.

158
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,270
我們得告訴威爾福德
We have to tell Wilford.

159
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,560
不是吧 
Really?

160
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
是的 出于尊重
Yes. Out of respect.

161
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,980
他就像我的家人一樣 我的意思是…
He's the closest thing I have to family. I mean…

162
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,480
除了你以外
After you now.

163
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,150
好吧
Okay.

164
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,490
小萊拉和奧斯威勒先生來了 他們想見你
Lilah Junior and Mr. Osweiller are here to see you.

165
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,660
帶他們進來
Ah, bring them.

166
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,240
他戴著領帶呢
- He's wearing a tie. - Mmm?

167
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,540
我年輕的夜車居民們
My young denizens of the Nightcar.

168
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,960
-我們能私下談談… -我們要結婚了
- Could we have a word in private-- - We're getting married.

169
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,340
-什么  -我們想第一個告訴您
- What? - We wanted you to be the first to know.

170
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,260
LJ 親愛的 這真是驚喜啊
LJ, my dear, what a surprise.

171
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,220
給她戴上這么漂亮的戒指 是一項明智之舉 奧斯威勒先生
Very wise to put such a nice ring on her finger, Mr. Osweiller.

172
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,970
我們有多久沒舉辦過婚禮了 
When was the last time we had a wedding?

173
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,180
這可是大事情
This is quite the occasion.

174
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,100
或許正是列車此刻所需要的
Perhaps just the occasion the train needs.

175
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,020
不 我們沒想大肆操辦
No, we're not expecting anything.

176
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,600
-我們甚至都不… -我想
- We don't even-- - I am.

177
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,320
你應該辦一場大婚禮 親愛的 人生的這一程太艱苦了
And you should, my dear. Life's been so bloody dreary this leg.

178
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,530
我們會允許所有人都歇一個班次
We'll give everyone a shift off.

179
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,570
提醒一下那些抱怨的人 團結是什么樣子的
Let's remind all the grumblers what unity looks like.

180
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,370
提醒他們我們是同一列列車上的 忠誠會得到回報
That we're all in this together, and loyalty is rewarded.

181
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,990
你覺得怎么樣 
- What do you think?

182
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,660
稍微歇口氣對大家有好處
- We could all use a little respite.

183
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,540
-或許可以多分一兩份口糧… -太好了 那就定在明天
- Maybe an extra ration or-- - Wonderful. Tomorrow then.

184
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,290
明天 
Tomorrow?

185
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,960
是呀 有何不可 沒時間臨陣退縮
Yeah. Why not? No time for cold feet.

186
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,880
LJ 我們要讓夜車煥然一新
We'll transform the Nightcar, LJ.

187
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,590
或者我該稱呼你為 “奧斯威勒太太” 
Or should I say, Mrs. Osweiller?

188
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,680
弗爾杰-奧斯威勒 
- Oh… Folger-Osweiller? - Um…

189
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,060
非常順口 我要用層層的紅色天鵝絨來布置
Rolls off the tongue. I'm seeing red velvet, layers.

190
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,060
扎拉 去找糕點師
Ah… Zarah, go see the Cakemaker.

191
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,650
-你把糕點師貶入堆肥區了 -那就把他弄出來 我們要舉辦婚禮
- You put the Cakemaker in Compost. - Then get him out. We're getting married.

192
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,320
（忠臣大婚 ）

193
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,440
給他沖個澡 他做糕點需要什么 就去面包房拿 明白嗎 
Get him a shower and anything he needs from the bakery, okay?

194
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,610
謝謝
Thank you. Thank you.

195
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,160
（全列車公假）

196
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,370
你在這里干什么 
What the hell are you doing here?

197
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,590
威爾福德在造武器 你知道這事嗎 
Wilford's building a weapon. You know anything about that?

198
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,090
我知道他在策劃什么 但不知道武器的事
I know he's up to something, but no.

199
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,630
魯絲看到哈維在制造那個武器 所以她想跟他取得聯系
Well, Ruth saw Javi working on it, so she wants to make contact with him.

200
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,550
我告訴過你們了 哈維不愿跟我說話
I told you guys, Javi won't talk to me.

201
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,760
自從被那只狗咬過之后 他整個人就變了
He hasn't been the same since that dog attack.

202
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,810
誰沒個傷疤呢  這是魯絲的決定 她想見他
Well, we all got scars. It's Ruth's call. She wants to see him.

203
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,700
砸顯示器也不會讓衛星與地球同步
Hitting the monitor does not tend to affect the satellite's geosync.

204
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,750
但能讓我感覺好受些 不過我們大家都不在狀態
What it does do is make me feel better, but we're all falling out of orbit.

205
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,790
本 我們要怎么在大海里撈到針呢 
How do you find a needle in a haystack?

206
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,920
謝天謝地 只是一片大海而已
Thank God, it's only a haystack.

207
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,170
-你有什么見解嗎  -只有一個
- You have any theories? - I have one theory.

208
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,220
他在跟蹤我們 
That he is following us?

209
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,680
這一心理假設真不錯啊
That's a pretty good psychological assumption.

210
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,060
我們將在一天左右回到主軌道 經過這里時
If he is following us, we're back on the main line in a day or so.

211
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,230
我們的衛星覆蓋范圍會有所改善 如果他在跟蹤我們
As we came through here, our satellite coverage improved.

212
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,440
或許我們就能探測到他
Maybe we see him then.

213
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,110
他也能探測到我們 
And he sees us?

214
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,030
你媽媽要是看到你昨天 駕馭列車時的表現 會很驕傲的
Your mum would be proud of how you handled the train yesterday.

215
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,330
我并不這么認為 本 不過謝謝你這么說
I don't really think so, Ben, but thank you.

216
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,790
艾莉 我們找到了一個幸存者
Alex, we found a survivor.

217
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,620
也許希望出現奇跡并無不可
Maybe we can hope for a miracle.

218
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,250
她已經死了 本
She's gone, Ben.

219
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,710
我可以接受
It's all right.

220
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,420
嘿
Hey.

221
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,750
跟我說說她是誰
Tell me who she is.

222
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,220
至少告訴我你在找什么
At least tell me what you're looking for.

223
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,260
（沙特阿拉伯 蘇丹）

224
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,200
你找到了什么 
What did you find?

225
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,580
（又做了一個夢）

226
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,260
就在這里
Just, uh, in here.

227
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,390
（乘務員）

228
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,010
我為你布置了一下
I've made it up for you.

229
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,390
真暖和啊
It's, uh… It's so warm.

230
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,730
-謝謝你… -我叫喬西
- Thank you, uh… - Josie.

231
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,980
喬西
Josie. Josie.

232
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,660
不好意思 我已經很久沒說話了
Sorry, it's, uh… It's been a long time since I spoke.

233
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,700
沒事 會慢慢熟練起來的
It's all right. It'll all come back.

234
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,290
你活下來了 我的意思是…
You made it. I mean… Wow.

235
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,960
你沒事吧 
You all right?

236
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,670
嗨
Hey.

237
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,300
你還好嗎 
You all right?

238
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,430
你離被凍死最近的一次有多近 
How close you ever come to freezing to death?

239
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,060
跟多數人差不多吧
I guess no less than most of us.

240
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,520
那經歷跟大家說的一樣嗎 
Is it like they say?

241
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,270
是的
Yeah.

242
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,440
你開始放松 開始覺得暖和
You start to relax. It goes warm.

243
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,240
會看到一些東西
You see things.

244
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,280
好吧
Okay.

245
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,700
比如說樹 
Like, uh, trees?

246
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,540
龍血樹 青草
Dragon's blood tree. Grass.

247
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,410
我能感覺到陽光
I could feel the sun.

248
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,250
那是我們在找的地方
It was the place we're looking for.

249
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,840
很高興你活過來了 因為那不是我們在找的地方
Well, I'm glad you came back 'cause it wasn't.

250
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,260
不 聽著 這種樹只在亞丁灣生長
No, look, these trees only grow in the Gulf of Aden,

251
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,970
亞丁灣就在阿拉伯暖點的中間
right here in the middle of our Arabian warm spot.

252
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,310
我以前從沒聽說過龍血樹
I'd never even heard of a dragon's blood tree before,

253
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,310
可我卻看到了它
but I saw it.

254
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,400
你是說你看到了未來 
Are you saying you had a vision?

255
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,730
-我只是在告訴你當時發生的事 -你告訴過別人嗎 
- I'm just telling you what happened. - You tell anyone else?

256
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,900
-沒有 -很好
- No. - Good.

257
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,530
保持正常狀態
Keep it on the rails.

258
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,160
你當時差點沒命了 所以記憶中的某些東西閃現了出來
You had a close call, something popped out of your memory.

259
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,240
高中時學過的某種樹
Some tree you learned about in high school.

260
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,210
是呀 你或許是對的 謝謝提點
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. Thanks.

261
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,290
嗯 好
Yeah. Okay.

262
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,170
和往常一樣 又經歷一次瀕死體驗 對嗎 
Another day, another near-death experience, right?

263
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,170
好
Okay.

264
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,840
-我愛你 哥們 -嗯
- Love you, buddy. - Yeah.

265
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,310
凱文 今天我們的攻勢與往日不同
We're on a different tack today, Kevin.

266
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,110
我們要發起魅力攻勢
A charm offensive.

267
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,280
你覺得怎么樣 
What do you think?

268
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,490
太紅了嗎 
Too much red?

269
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,530
紅色永不嫌夠 先生
Never enough red, sir.

270
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,780
我同意
I agree.

271
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,540
-你為什么要那么說  -說什么 
- Why'd you say that? - Say what?

272
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,250
我說什么了 
What?

273
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,370
“弗爾杰-奧斯威勒”
"Folger-Osweiller."

274
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,960
我只是那么一說而已 沒想到他會記到登記簿上
I just said it. I didn't know he'd put it on the register.

275
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,920
是呀 這下他成了婚禮的主角
Yeah, well, it's his wedding now.

276
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,840
-我就知道他會這么做 -那又怎樣 
- I knew he'd do this. - So what?

277
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,130
這一天 我們將會享受 國王和王后的待遇
We get to be king and queen of everything for a day.

278
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,720
他是在利用我們 LJ
He's using us, LJ.

279
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,300
他是在我們身上作投資
He's investing in us.

280
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,560
辦一場小小的儀式 我就很開心了
I would've been very happy with something small.

281
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,390
給你唱首歌 就幾個朋友在場 但這是不可能的 對嗎 
Sing you a song, a few of us. That wasn't on the table, was it?

282
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,850
沒錯 因為我們沒有朋友
Yeah, because we don't have any friends.

283
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,150
我希望我們成為大腕夫婦 有一天我們可能會管理這列列車
I wanna be in a power couple. We could run this train one day.

284
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,110
-天啊 LJ  -怎么了 
- LJ, Jesus! - What?

285
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,780
年邁的人不斷死去 都快沒有年輕人了
Old people keep dying off, there's barely any young people left.

286
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,030
很快 就得由我們來統領他們
And soon, we'll have to rule them.

287
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,990
這可是我們的婚禮啊 你就從不停止算計嗎 
It's our wedding day. Do you ever stop conniving?

288
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,290
-算計是好事 -好吧 
- Conniving is good. - Fine!

289
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,840
去算計吧 現在想取消已經太遲了
Connive away! It's too late to call it off now,

290
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,460
因為提出取消 威爾福德就會 把我的腦袋凍掉 對嗎 
'cause Wilford would have my head out a port, wouldn't he?

291
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,260
別這樣甩手走開 
Don't walk away from me!

292
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,590
奧斯 
Oz?

293
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,900
哈維 
Javi?

294
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,920
哈維 
Javi?

295
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,300
你可以跟我說話的 這里沒有別人
You can talk to me. No one is here.

296
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,180
工程師 威爾福德要你去頭等車廂
Engineer, Wilford wants you down in First.

297
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,470
可我在上班呢
But I'm on shift.

298
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,940
我不知道 他要你去的 所以設成自動駕駛 快去就是
I don't know. That's what he wants, so put it on autopilot and off you go.

299
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,910
你看上去很漂亮
You look beautiful.

300
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,870
今天是你的大日子
- It's your big day. - Would you leave it?

301
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,250
你能別去管它了嗎 
I don't care if it looks like shit. Just leave it.

302
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,460
我不在乎它是否亂糟糟的 別去管它就是
Oh, dear. I heard the bride might be blue, but blue in the face?

303
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,050
天啊 我聽說過新娘子會有婚前憂郁 不知道還會大發脾氣
Excuse me.

304
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,640
-我先出去了 -好 那樣最好 謝謝
Yes, that will be best, thank you.

305
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,060
好了 來 告訴我你在為什么生氣
Now, now, here. Now, tell me what you fought about?

306
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,980
“你總是在算計” 他覺得我又自私又冷酷
"You're always conniving." He thinks I'm selfish and I'm cruel.

307
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,900
有時候我不得不那樣 不是嗎 
I have to be sometimes, don't I?

308
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,240
所以我才想讓你待在夜車上 LJ
It's why I wanted you in the Nightcar, LJ.

309
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,610
你是個現實主義者 你知道有人受傷是難免的事
You're a realist. You understand someone always gets hurt.

310
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,080
就是 我雖然不會大聲說出來 但“這就是生活”
Yes, it's like, I don't say it out loud, but c'est la vie.

311
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,410
他或許還覺得 整場婚禮都被我接管了
He also probably thinks I'm taking over the whole ceremony.

312
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,460
你明白為什么 你們的婚禮對我很重要嗎 
Do you understand why your wedding is important to me?

313
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,670
能幫你管束大家
Helps keep everyone in line.

314
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,630
沒錯 他們會看到 只有一種辦事方法 就是我的方法
Yes. They see there's only one way, the way I do things.

315
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,430
你看 在這列列車上 有一樣東西
You see, on the train, the old laws and morality,

316
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,930
比舊法和道德更重要 它是什么 
they don't matter as much as… what?

317
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,560
-忠誠 -沒錯
- Loyalty. - That's right.

318
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,520
對列車的忠誠
Loyalty to the train.

319
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,030
好了 你這假惺惺的眼淚 留著到婚禮上流吧
Now, save the crocodile tears for the ceremony.

320
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,860
為了我 好好表演一番
Make a show of it, for me.

321
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,120
我會的
I will.

322
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,330
回頭見
See you soon.

323
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,210
婚床放在這里很不錯呀
Lovely spot for your wedding bed.

324
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,430
謝謝夸獎 是我們自己布置的
Thank you. We, uh, did it ourselves.

325
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,350
過來
Come.

326
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,600
坐 來啊
Sit down. Come on.

327
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,980
年輕激昂的愛情 我很熟悉
Young, tumultuous love, I know it well.

328
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,570
我指的是激昂的部分 我已經不再年輕了
Well, the tumultuous part, not the young bit anymore.

329
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,660
不過 LJ不開心
But LJ's upset.

330
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,240
是的 這個嘛…
Yeah, well, it's, uh…

331
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,120
是婚前緊張
Pre-wedding jitters.

332
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,670
我們會沒事的 是的
We'll be fine. Yeah.

333
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,000
我對她有很強的保護意識
Well, I am rather protective of her.

334
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,760
所以 我好好查閱了一下 羅齊先生的人事記錄
So I had a long look at Mr. Roche's personnel records,

335
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,090
你當制動員的時候 很會把握各種機會嘛
and you were an opportunistic boy in blue.

336
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,640
我經營過幾份副業 是的 先生
Well, ran a few side hustles. Yes, sir.

337
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,930
一個劣跡斑斑的企業家
Ah, an entrepreneur with a vicious streak.

338
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,650
這是當夜車經理的優良品質
Good qualities in a Nightcar manager.

339
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,980
然而…
And yet…

340
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,360
這雙手…
these hands…

341
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,620
卻能彈奏如此動聽的鋼琴曲
play piano so beautifully.

342
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,540
你心里有點渴望成為一名藝術家
Part of you just yearns to be an artiste,

343
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,660
顫聲吟唱最悲傷的歌曲
warbling the saddest of songs.

344
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,460
我不是在所謂的 富有創造性的環境中長大的
Well, I didn't grow up in what you'd call a creative environment.

345
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,920
你表達了自己的心聲
You found your voice.

346
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
鋼琴師 
Piano man, hmm?

347
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,510
你那紅發妻子則負責吧臺
And his ginger wife behind the bar.

348
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,310
你們是我的團隊
You're my team here.

349
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,520
這點我們明白
We understand that.

350
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
真的
We do.

351
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,940
你們制動員搜身的手法 還記得嗎 
Your Brakeman shakedown move, remember?

352
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,900
你也抓我的
Squeeze mine too.

353
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,070
來吧 抓吧
Go on. Squeeze them.

354
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,490
用力點
Harder.

355
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,910
再用力點 用上所有的勁道
Harder. Give them some basso profundo.

356
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,040
好 你的雙手是用來干什么的 
Now, what are your hands for, hmm?

357
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,460
捏碎別人的蛋
Crushing balls.

358
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,510
還要用來愛撫你的妻子
And caressing your wife.

359
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,650
在那之后 你想怎么彈琴都行
When that's done, by all means, tickle the ivories.

360
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,570
因為你非常有才華
Because you're very talented.

361
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,030
這是真心話
I mean that.

362
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
文件
Papers.

363
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
包
Bag.

364
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,050
德拉托爾先生
Mr. De la Torre.

365
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,010
是我
Just me.

366
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,770
好久不見了
Long time no see.

367
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,810
魯絲 可你…
Ruth? But you…

368
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,190
你應該在另一列列車上呀
You're on the other train.

369
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,310
不 我一直都在這里 幫助乘客們
No, I've been here the whole time. I've been helping the passengers.

370
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,610
為我們在外面的朋友盡己所能
Doing my bit for our friends out there.

371
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,900
你不該在這里的
You shouldn't be here.

372
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,360
哈維
Oh, Javi.

373
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,950
-我很抱歉… -不…
- Oh, I'm sorry-- - No, no, no…

374
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,580
工程師 我只是要你幫忙 拜托了
Engineer, I just… I just need your help, please.

375
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,790
你在列車后部做的那個東西 它是什么 它能做什么 
The thing that you're working on back there, what is it? What does it do?

376
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,000
它能徹底阻止雷頓
It's gonna stop Layton dead.

377
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,170
-我得回狗那里去了 抱歉 -不 先別走
- I need to go back to the dog, I'm sorry. - No, not yet.

378
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,720
你得告訴我它是怎么運作的
Tell me how it works.

379
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,310
-不  -哈維 哈維 
- No. No! No! - Javi? Javi!

380
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,820
你美極了
Gorgeous.

381
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,880
歡迎 勇敢的乘客們 工人們 及其他所有人
Welcome, brave passengers, workers, all now.

382
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,720
我很高興大家能暫停手頭的工作
It's my great pleasure to pause our labors,

383
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,050
花點時間團聚在一起
and spend time in union.

384
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,470
今天我們匯聚一堂 是為了慶祝
The union today by marriage,

385
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,230
小萊拉弗爾杰 和約翰克里斯多夫奧斯威勒喜結良緣
of Lilah Folger Junior and John Christopher Osweiller.

386
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,530
我知道 最近這段行程 非常寒冷 供給不足
I know these have been cold miles of deprivation.

387
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,160
紀律嚴酷
And discipline is harsh.

388
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,580
你們都得了凍瘡
You've paid in frostbite,

389
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,500
所愛的人因流感而喪生 愿他們安息
and loved ones lost to influenza. May they rest in peace.

390
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,920
所以 該是慶祝勝利的時候了 不是嗎 
So it's time we celebrate a win, isn't it?

391
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,890
傳統的婚姻
Old World matrimony.

392
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,470
各位 把酒杯倒滿 我們有足夠的酒 大家都有份
Everyone, fill a glass. There's enough for every soul.

393
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,100

Extra hot food too.

394
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,270
-我去去就回 -好
- I'll be back. - Okay.

395
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,650
讓全車上下 都為萊拉和約翰舉起酒杯吧
Raise a glass up and down our train for Lilah and John.

396
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,360

Come on. Cheers.

397
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,450

398
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,740
再敬我們與列車牢不可破的協議
To our unbreakable pact with the train.

399
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,040
敬忠誠
To loyalty

400
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,250
以及你們與我的約定
and your contract with me.

401
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,290
生存
To survive.

402
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,340
威爾福德 
Wilford! Wilford!

403
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,850
聽上去像是一種電磁脈沖武器
Sounds like an electromagnetic pulse weapon.

404
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,480
我從來沒有真正見過
Never actually seen one before.

405
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,730
-但你知道它的運作原理吧  -知道
- But you do know how it works? - Yeah.

406
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,200
它能發出電磁脈沖 破壞雪國列車上的所有電子設備
It sends out an electromagnetic pulse killing the electronics on Snowpiercer,

407
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,240
讓雷頓的列車無法前進
leaving Layton dead in the water.

408
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,460
那趁著這場婚禮 我們來設法阻止那種情況發生
So while this wedding is happening, let's try and make it not do that.

409
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,370
有操作手冊嗎 
- You got a manual?

410
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,750
拜托 光明
- Come on, Lights.

411
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,290
我跟魯絲說你很擅長這類活兒
I told the lady you're good at this kind of thing.

412
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,500
解除電磁脈沖武器 
Disarming EMPs?

413
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,880
是呀
Yeah.

414
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,350
干嗎 
What?

415
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,480
哈維 你要去哪兒 
Where you going, Javi?

416
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,650
回狗那里去
- Back to the dog. - Ah-ah.

417
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,690
你剛才去哪兒了 
Where are you coming from?

418
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,490
收集最后一套數據
Final data collection.

419
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,410
我能走了嗎 
Can I go?

420
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,710
跟我來
Come with me.

421
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,550
跟著我
Follow me.

422
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,390
你也是
You too.

423
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,650
現在 我要你們完成
Now, I ask you to take the sacred steps

424
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,020
與永恒機車相結合的神圣儀式
in union with the Eternal Engine.

425
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,990
這四步代表了人類所經歷的歷程
These four steps represent the path humanity has taken.

426
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,080
從青草
From grass

427
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,910
到寒冰
to ice.

428
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,750
-從寒冰到鋼鐵 -從寒冰到鋼鐵
- From ice to steel. - From ice to steel.

429
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,710
從鋼鐵到…
And from steel to the lights…

430
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,470
永恒機車的燈光
of the Eternal Engine.

431
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,140
有人來過這里嗎 
Anyone come through here?

432
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
那個被狗咬了臉的工程師常來這里
That dog-faced engineer's here all the time.

433
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,770
不過他很快就會出來
But he's in and out.

434
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,980
我們還是要進去看看
Well, we'll check it anyway.

435
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,020
敵人會覺得這場婚禮 是他們行動的好時機 不是嗎 
Wouldn't this wedding be a great distraction for the enemy?

436
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,700
我完全不知道要怎么解除這玩意兒
I have no idea how to disarm this thing.

437
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,160
你就各處擺弄一下唄
Just start messing with it.

438
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,200
-這就是你的計劃  -你才是我的計劃
- That's your plan? - You're my plan.

439
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,210
軍靴和待客部的人來了 
Jackboots and teal coming!

440
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,130
-什么  -我們會被困在這里的 快離開
- What? - They'll pin us back here. Let's go.

441
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,710
我們得走了 快走
We gotta go. Let's go.

442
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,090
-來呀 -不行 你們得繼續解除武器
- Come on. - No. You need to keep working on it.

443
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,340
你打算干什么 
What are you gonna do?

444
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,010
我得去干擾他們 否則大家都會被困在這里
I'll need to run interference or we're all stuck back here.

445
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,310
如果他們看到了我 就不會進到這里來
They won't keep coming if they see me.

446
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,480
只管解除這武器 給雷頓一個戰斗機會
Just disable it, and give Layton a fighting chance.

447
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,810
-魯絲… -派克先生 這是命令
- Ruth-- - That is an order, Mr. Pike.

448
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,690
現在由你來負責了
You're in charge now.

449
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,110
我信任你
I believe in you.

450
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,870
恭喜啊
Congratulations.

451
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,620
真不錯
That's nice.

452
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,930
是你
You.

453
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,430
沒錯 凱文 是我
Yes, Kevin. It's me.

454
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,810
你一直以來都在找的人
The one you've been looking for all this time.

455
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,610
你像只沒頭蒼蠅一樣到處瞎找
Running around like a chicken with your head cut off.

456
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,770
現在我來投降了
I'm surrendering.

457
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,860
我又冷又餓 所以 動手吧
I'm cold and I'm starving. So, come on.

458
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,320
不費吹灰之力 你就能當上英雄了
You get to be the hero without ever lifting a finger.

459
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,200
把她帶走
Take her.

460
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,810
最初我們有34個人
There were 34 of us to start,

461
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,610
依靠核電站的剩余電力竭力維持
eking it out on the plant's residual power.

462
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,490
都是韓國科學家
Korean scientists,

463
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,610
以及像我這樣的外國核技術人員
foreign nuclear technicians like me.

464
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,200
還有我們的一些家人
Some of our families too.

465
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,870
掠奪者死光之前 殺死了我們大約一半的人 然后…
Marauders killed about half of us before they died out. And then--

466
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,000
掠奪者 
Marauders?

467
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,000
然后嚴寒或輻射中毒 奪走了其余人的性命
And then the cold or radiation poisoning took the rest of us.

468
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,420
我侄子當時是15歲
My nephew, he was 15 years old.

469
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,720
他是最后一個死的
He was the last to go.

470
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,930
他得了甲狀腺癌
He had thyroid cancer.

471
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,400
到最后 他在求我把他殺了
By the end, he was begging me to kill him.

472
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,230
那是大約四年前的事了
That was about four years ago.

473
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,820
在那之后…
After that…

474
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,530
我…
I…

475
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,400
我就沒有了時間的概念
I lost time.

476
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,070
不再抱有希望 不再去想
I stopped hoping, stopped thinking.

477
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,290
除了我之外還有其他人住在那下面
It's like someone other than me lived down there.

478
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,670
然后我看見了你
Then I turned my eyes on you.

479
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,420
我很抱歉地告訴你
I hate to tell you this,

480
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,750
在你與世隔絕期間 人類并沒怎么進化
but humankind hasn't exactly evolved in your absence.

481
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,010
你甘冒生命危險 甚至不顧理智 就為了救我
You pushed past what was safe, even sane, to rescue me.

482
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,890
為什么 
Why?

483
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,520
我很高興自己那么做了
I'm just glad I did.

484
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,030
我們還是基本沒有信號
We're still basically blind.

485
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,950
我們上次到這里時還有衛星圖像的
We had picture last time we came out here.

486
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,780
-衛星信號在持續減弱 -說說其他選擇
The satellites continue to degrade. - Options?

487
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,280
等等 我們有其他選擇 
- Wait, there's options?

488
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,000
我們直接回到主軌道上
We go back directly to the main line,

489
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,210
到時候 如果他們在我們前面 我們就會看到跡象
where we either see physical signs they're in front of us,

490
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,080
不然 我們就知道他們在后面
or we know they're behind us.

491
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,170
或者我們可以與主軌道平行前進
Or we parallel the main line,

492
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,720
希望信號會變好 能讓我們在衛星圖像上探測到他們
hoping the signal improves enough so we can glimpse them on the sat.

493
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,930
-選第二個方法 -遵命
- Second route. - Roger that.

494
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,530
你剛才那樣決定的依據是什么 
And, um, you picked that based on what?

495
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,820
又看到了未來 
Another vision?

496
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,030
不是 不上主軌道 我們會有更多選擇的余地 對嗎 
No, I mean, there's gotta be more options off the main line, right?

497
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,450
對
Yeah.

498
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,680
她為我們犧牲了自己 所以現在我們得解除這玩意兒
She sacrificed for us. So now, we gotta kill this thing.

499
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,140
-好嗎  -這是筆記本電腦的連接口
- Okay? - The laptop patch is in here.

500
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,890
所以沒法黑入它的軟件
So we can't hack the software.

501
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,780
也許我們可以中斷電源 擾亂它的供電
Maybe we can disrupt the power supply, mess with it.

502
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,950
這好像是裝載程序面板
Looks like an arming sequence.

503
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,290
-它被激活了 -糟糕 
- It's live. - Oh, shit!

504
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,630
-我覺得它處于全脈沖狀態 -是 我看到了
- I think it's at full pulse. - I can see that.

505
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,840
我沒法把它關了
I can't turn it down.

506
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,470
停不下來
It's not stopping.

507
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,640
好吧…
Well…

508
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,860
我早知道會是一個 對鐵路后勤具有敏銳洞察力的人
I knew it had to be someone with acumen for rail logistics.

509
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,070
但老實說 更令我欽佩的是
But to be honest, I'm more impressed with how low you went

510
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,150
你居然會如此屈尊 跟末等人混在一起
to grovel it out in the bowels.

511
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,740
我在盡量不辜負期望 先生
Well, I do try not to disappoint, sir.

512
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,870
如果你能保持忠誠該多好
If you'd only stayed loyal.

513
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,370
我是忠誠的
I am loyal.

514
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,540
我的忠誠給了比你更重要的東西 威爾福德先生 你全搞錯了
To something bigger than you. You've got it all wrong, Mr. Wilford.

515
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,510
這話我一直聽到 但我還是贏了
I hear that all the time, and then I win.

516
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,880
贏和領導是兩回事
Winning isn't leading.

517
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,640
光有忠誠還不夠
Loyalty isn't enough on its own.

518
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,890
還需要有愛 不是你享受的那種敬畏之愛
It has to come with love. And not the kind that you feed off.

519
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,600
而是無條件的愛 愿為每一個乘客犧牲
Unconditional love. Sacrifice, for each and every passenger.

520
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,850
-老天  -你不能忽視愛的力量
- Oh, God! - You can't ignore love.

521
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,520
你也無法預測它的力量
You can't predict it either.

522
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,200
好吧 我們得把這玩意兒 送出那扇門去
We gotta get this thing out that door.

523
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,910
-沒有開門的密碼 也沒防護服 -我在想辦法呢
- We don't have door codes or breach suits. - Uh, thinking. Uh…

524
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,370
第二年那場叛亂
Year two rebellion.

525
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,200
他們封了通勤車的門不讓我們上 但我們弄壞了鉸鏈
They sealed the subtrain doors on us, but we compromised the hinges.

526
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,290
快去
Go.

527
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,540
在這里
Here.

528
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,420
強壯男孩 準備好
Strong Boy, get it ready.

529
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,050
好 解除了 來吧
Okay. Clear. Come on.

530
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,680
動手吧
Let's go.

531
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,310
準備好了 
Ready!

532
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,770
他們此刻正在為你準備門洞
They're preparing the port for you now.

533
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,820
我會確保他們把臂銬放高夾緊
I'll make sure they mount the cuff nice and high

534
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,900
讓你將來沒法裝假肢
where prosthetics are impossible.

535
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,030
反正我也不會戴假肢
Wouldn't wear one anyway.

536
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,080
來吧 你好了嗎 
Come on. You got it?

537
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,000
好 快跑 姐妹 快跑
Okay, run. Run, sister, run.

538
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,470
快走
Go.

539
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,400
諷刺的是 我當初建門洞 只是一種虛聲恫嚇
The irony is, I built the ports in as an idle threat.

540
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,360
從沒想過要使用它們
Never expected to use them.

541
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,580
而你卻用了
You did.

542
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,450
13次
Thirteen times.

543
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,370
我愿意贖罪
I'll pay my penance.

544
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
把我的手臂凍掉吧
You can have my arm.

545
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,250
我很好奇那會是什么
- Whoa. - Whoa.

546
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,090
是電磁波 
I wonder, what on earth could that be?

547
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,050
正在三角定位
Electromagnetic?

548
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,390
這是特征痕跡 一定是他們
Triangulating.

549
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,300
沒錯 是他們
Well, that's the signature. It's gotta be them.

550
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,600
在我們西側520公里處
Yes, it is. Five hundred and twenty kilometers west.

551
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,220
他們在主軌道上
They're on the main line.

552
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,230
這比在衛星圖像上找到他們強多了
That's a lot better than seeing them on sat.

553
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,230
是嗎 也就是說威爾福德看不到我們
Yeah? So it means Wilford can't see us.

554
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,650
我們比他有優勢
We got the drop on him.

555
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,980
-威爾福德討厭意外之事 -很好
- Well, Wilford hates surprises. - Good.

556
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,740
我們去給他一個“驚喜”
Let's go give him one.

557
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,140
我為你們做了一樣東西
I built something for you.

558
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,310
一樣本可以挽救無數性命的東西
Something that would have saved countless lives.

559
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,820
我們本可以不費一顆彈藥
We could have snuffed out Layton's pirate train

560
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,900
就毀掉雷頓的強盜列車
without firing a shot.

561
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,280
如今 就因為一個
Now, thanks to a rat

562
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,740
躲在管道中的叛徒
found hiding in the pipes,

563
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,410
這場戰爭爆發時
when this war comes,

564
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,540
你們將會有傷亡
you're all going to bleed.

565
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,130
都因為你 這場戰爭 又將回到原始的打斗方法
It's back to broadswords and shields because of you.

566
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,390
先生 好了 隨時可以行刑
Ready when you are, sir.

567
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,810
那就凍斷它吧
Let's get it bloody off then.

568
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,170
他們回來了
They're back. They're back.

569
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,780
-去戰斗崗位  -快走 
- Battle stations! - Let's go!

570
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,570
去戰斗崗位 狗崽子們 
Battle stations, you dogs!

571
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,700
快啊 
Come on!

572
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:58,020
