1
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:05,397
<i>It all started when a time-travel
experiment I was conducting... </i>

2
00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:08,402
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,962
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock,</i>
<i>I went from quantum physicist... </i>

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,407
<i>... to air force test pilot,</i>

5
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:18,878
<i>which could have been fun</i>
<i>if I knew how to fly. </i>

6
00:00:18,947 --> 00:00:22,644
<i>Fortunately, I had help... </i>
<i>an observer from the project named Al. </i>

7
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:27,155
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram,</i>
<i>so all he can lend is moral support. </i>

8
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:30,214
<i>Anyway, here I am,</i>
<i>bouncing around in time,</i>

9
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:32,226
<i>putting things right</i>
<i>that once went wrong... </i>

10
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:36,321
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger</i>
<i>with Al as my Tonto,</i>

11
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:39,333
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

12
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:41,859
Oh, boy.

13
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:59,847
<i>Bouncing around in time</i>
<i>can be a little disorienting,</i>

14
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:02,941
<i>a little taxing on the nerves,</i>

15
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:06,419
<i>a little jolting to the... equilibrium. </i>

16
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:10,354
<i>It can also be very rewarding. </i>

17
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,985
<i>Unfortunately, like the Bible says,</i>

18
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:15,052
<i>the Lord giveth... </i>

19
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,797
<i>And the Lord taketh away. </i>

20
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,785
Not gonna do it.
I want heirs, Tess.

21
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:41,687
I want Riata to stay in the family,
to go to my grandsons.

22
00:02:41,756 --> 00:02:45,920
Well, I don't see that happening, Chance.
So if you're so damn set on disinheriting me...

23
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:48,827
if I don't lift up my tail
and act like a brood mare,

24
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:53,027
then maybe you should figure out some way to
take the spread with you when the time comes.

25
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:56,669
It's all my fault. I raised you
to run this place like a man,

26
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,971
and now you don't
know how to be a woman.

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,806
That's just fine with me. I never
did take to sashayin' and swoonin'.

28
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,678
Well, your mama, God rest her soul, she'd
have made a woman of you instead of a cowboy.

29
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:09,216
Why can't I be both?
'Cause it ain't natural.

30
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:12,481
Get married, Tess.
Who do you expect me to marry?

31
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:14,818
Ben or Eddie...

32
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,256
or Zeke?

33
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,052
I won't breed with inferior stock,
Chance.

34
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,564
The man I marry has to be
more of a man than I am.

35
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:27,602
Now, daughter, I'm here to tell you.
I don't want to hurt your feelings,

36
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:31,036
but any man on this ranch
is more man than you are.

37
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:35,543
Bull. Nobody here can keep
up with me, including Wayne.

38
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,511
Aw, now you're talkin'
like a fool, girl.

39
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,525
And I'll tell you what. If
there's a man on this ranch

40
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:42,949
who can keep up with me for
one week, then I'll marry him.

41
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:46,920
But if he can't, then we forget about
this marriage business once and for all.

42
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:49,889
Honey, you just overplayed your hand.
I pick.

43
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:53,359
No. I pick him.

44
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:55,191
I pick...

45
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,097
Him.

46
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:06,970
Tess, you can't be serious.

47
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:10,136
You said any man on the ranch,
Chance, and a deal's a deal.

48
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:13,078
Right, Doc? Right.

49
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:16,276
- You go for it, Doc?
- Go for what?

50
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:20,720
Marriage, son.
To Tess and 50,000 acres of Riata.

51
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,885
If you can outride,
out rope and all-around out cowboy me.

52
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,418
- You're kiddin', right?
- This is Texas, son.

53
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:32,933
We don't kid about our land,
our women or our livestock.

54
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:37,768
- Now, what's the matter with that little pig?
- Uh... Wha...

55
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,778
- It's hog cholera, ain't it?
- Hog cholera, uh...

56
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:47,008
Well, you... you never know with pigs.

57
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:52,645
Damn, I was afraid of that. We're gonna
have to shoot the whole mess of'em.

58
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:54,985
- Shoot 'em?
- Then burn 'em.

59
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:59,285
No, no, no, no, no. You can't...
You can't shoot 'em,

60
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:04,458
because I, uh, haven't made
a... a diagnosis yet.

61
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:06,864
Uh, okay?

62
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,876
Well, what do ya say?

63
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:21,143
I'll take the pig.
You keep the daughter.

64
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:34,455
Well, pick another one.
Nope. It's Doc or nothin'.

65
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:37,657
Come on, Tess.
Or nothin', Chance.

66
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:44,528
Doc's a fool.

67
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,716
<i>Thad and me... </i>

68
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:58,753
<i>... thad and me</i>

69
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,690
<i>All he does is chew and chew</i>

70
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:13,561
<i>Thad and me</i>

71
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:17,196
<i>All he does is</i>

72
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:19,604
<i>Baa at me</i>

73
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:27,688
<i>Every time I leap,</i>

74
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,312
<i>I do this song and dance to find </i>
<i>out who I am and where I live. </i>

75
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:36,346
<i>Sometimes... it's hard,</i>

76
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:39,359
<i>and sometimes it's easy. </i>

77
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:44,990
<i>All he does is baa at me</i>

78
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:52,084
<i>Figuring out the names of everyone I'm
supposed to know is a little tougher,</i>

79
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:53,770
<i>especially if they're alone. </i>

80
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:57,938
- Hey, Doc.
- Hi, uh, pard.

81
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:01,243
What happened to you?

82
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:03,614
Oh, just had a little accident.

83
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:06,483
Looks like you got us
another patient there.

84
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:09,112
Yeah, gotta figure out what's
causin' this little guy's runny nose.

85
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:10,354
Think it might be the hog cholera?

86
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:12,950
No, it's not hog chol... cholera.

87
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:15,018
Whatever you say, Doc.

88
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:19,897
Listen, I fed and watered all the
animals and, uh, cleaned out the cages.

89
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:23,597
Thanks, uh, pard.

90
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:28,005
See ya tomorrow, Doc.
Come on, Pard. Let's go.

91
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:36,442
Couldn't you give 'em name tags?

92
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:38,509
Or tattoos.

93
00:07:42,323 --> 00:07:45,952
Tina's got her name in a tattoo.

94
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:48,860
Course, that wouldn't do you much good,
because it's...

95
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,093
It's in a super private part
of her anatomy.

96
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:58,802
Of course, she always thought
you were kind of cute.

97
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:04,175
Uh, Sam, you've never seen
Tina's tattoo, have you?

98
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,052
- You didn't answer my question, Sam.
- What?

99
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,796
- Did you ever see Tina's tattoo?
- Are you serious?

100
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:30,463
You've seen it.

101
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:36,742
Al, I don't even remember Tina,
let alone her tattoo.

102
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:41,373
- You're hiding behind your Swiss cheese brain.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

103
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:46,011
Nah, it couldn't be you.
You're stuck here in 1956.

104
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:49,398
56's? I'm still a baby. My
sister Kate's not even born yet.

105
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,888
Who's President, Eisenhower?

106
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,190
- Ike Bentenhoff.
- What?

107
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:55,696
He works in Imaging Control.

108
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:59,996
At the Christmas party, when Lucille and
I slipped off into the energizing chamber...

109
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:02,332
- to... to...
- I know, I know.

110
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:08,273
Exchange gifts, that dirty dog took
advantage of my absence to cozy up to Tina.

111
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:12,746
- Tina's cheating on you?
- Can you believe it?

112
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:15,112
It boggles the mind.

113
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:21,982
Come in here, Al.

114
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:26,158
It's like Noah's Ark.

115
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:28,559
Well, this is kinda fun.

116
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:33,864
Oh, listen, Al. You figure out
what I'm here to do?

117
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:37,496
Oh, uh, no, I haven't finished
the computation yet.

118
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:39,563
Uh, just a second.

119
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:42,903
Uh, well, according to Ziggy,

120
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:48,074
there's a 72% chance
you're here to cure the pig.

121
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:53,246
For a minute I thought I was
here to marry Tess. Huh! Oh.

122
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:57,121
"Oh," what? Oh, oh, well, I haven't
run a number on that yet. Wait.

123
00:09:58,993 --> 00:10:01,154
Oh, it's not so bad, Sam.

124
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:05,256
Uh, there's only a 47% chance
you're gonna marry this girl Tess.

125
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:09,463
- Hey, Al, do pigs like milk?
- Oh, they adore it.

126
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:12,995
Do you know what's wrong with this...
with him?

127
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:16,339
Uh, it's not a him, Sam. It's a girl.

128
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:19,039
Trust me, Sam.

129
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:26,277
Runny nose, watery eyes...

130
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:30,518
Squeaky voice... loud squeaky voice.

131
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:35,088
I don't know, Al. I don't know...

132
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:39,031
Al. Al, that raccoon can see you.

133
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,331
Oh, well, almost all animals can see me.

134
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:44,746
But, you know, there must be
somethin' weird lookin' about me,

135
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:46,430
because I seem to intimidate them.

136
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:48,771
Maybe it's your clothes.

137
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:56,046
Hey, Al.
Here's a scrapbook on Tess McGill.

138
00:10:58,386 --> 00:11:01,878
- Look at this.
- What?

139
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:04,720
Well, it-it's Doc's diary.

140
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:08,193
Correction, it's your diary.

141
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:11,026
Well, technically it is, but,

142
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:14,193
I mean, you know,
in reality it's...

143
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:17,999
Just go ahead
and read the diary, Sam.

144
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:24,573
"I saw her today. She was having trouble
getting her prize stallion to mate.

145
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:27,170
That's a cross we all have to bear...

146
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:30,945
performance under pressure.

147
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,318
"I wanted to take her in my arms,
to kiss her cheeks, her eyes, her lips,

148
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:37,085
"but after all these years,
I'm still dumbstruck in her presence.

149
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:41,151
Will I ever have the courage
to tell Tess how much I love her?"

150
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:44,062
Al, Doc's in love with Tess.

151
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:46,396
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh," what?

152
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:50,062
Well, uh, there's a 97% probability...

153
00:11:50,138 --> 00:11:54,006
that someone who's been sending
her love letters will marry Tess.

154
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:59,012
Well, uh, then I'm okay, because this is a diary.
It's not love letters.

155
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,311
Don't fight it, Sam.
You're here to marry this cowboy.

156
00:12:02,383 --> 00:12:06,012
Uh, boy-girl. Cowgirl. Girl.

157
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,587
Tess, look here.

158
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:25,805
Mornin', Doc.

159
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,864
Chance.

160
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,542
Does your bein' here
mean we got to shoot 'em?

161
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,603
Shoot 'em?

162
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:36,582
Oh, uh, no, no. Uh, I haven't
figured out what's wrong with Piggy,

163
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:38,585
but it's not hog cholera.
Piggy?

164
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:42,987
That's what I-I... named the little pig.

165
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:45,048
Piggy.

166
00:12:45,126 --> 00:12:47,788
Then you're here
to take me on, Doc?

167
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:52,322
That's right, Tess.
I'm here to take you on.

168
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,631
Yahoo, boys!
We got us a contest!

169
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:02,142
Get you in shape.

170
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,940
Come on. Take this, would ya?
Take this thing.

171
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:07,173
Easy.

172
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:09,409
Here, Doc. You don't have to do that. Oh.

173
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:11,475
Take that one.
Thanks.

174
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:23,119
First thing my Dad taught me
about mounting an unknown horse...

175
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:27,861
was to look him straight in the eye
and show him who's boss.

176
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,462
Then, with a good grip on the reins,

177
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:34,167
mount quickly and take a firm seat.

178
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:37,143
After that, the rest was easy.

179
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:49,787
Uuh!

180
00:13:55,263 --> 00:14:00,030
<i>Hey, Doc! Got a bottle of liniment for
you right here! Get up there!</i>

181
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:03,330
What the hell's got into you, Doc?

182
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:07,238
All of Texas knows nobody's ever
ridden Widowmaker, except me.

183
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,870
Ooh!

184
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:20,352
Hope you don't mind, Doc.

185
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,116
Just a little cowboy humor.

186
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:30,392
Well, I...
I always liked a good joke.

187
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:03,161
Ever do any ropin', Doc?

188
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:05,495
Well, it's been a while.

189
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:08,034
You, uh, knot your rope to the horn,
or you dally it?

190
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:11,538
- Dally?
- From the Mex... dale vuelta.

191
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:13,597
It means to give it a turn.

192
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:16,268
See, you just take the rope
in your hand like this,

193
00:15:16,344 --> 00:15:19,507
give it a turn
around the horn for leverage.

194
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,913
Easier to release.

195
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:25,919
It's your turn, Doc. You up to it?

196
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:29,514
Dale... Vuelta.

197
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,491
- Dale vuelta.
- Yeah. Go get 'em.

198
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:36,395
Yah!

199
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:47,567
What were you two palaverin' about?

200
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:51,134
Oh, I was just, uh,
showin' him how to dally his rope.

201
00:16:10,898 --> 00:16:14,834
You tell him to keep his thumb up?

202
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:17,996
Wayne, if he's not careful
that rope will jerk his thumb off.

203
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:20,438
You wanna win this contest or not?

204
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:25,300
Now, I'm tellin' you somethin'.
The main mistake you're makin' is...

205
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:27,847
pick one and stay on him, patient.

206
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:32,011
Even if another one is closer,
don't go after this'un and after that'un.

207
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:36,682
Pick one and stay with that one.
Now go try it again. Go on.

208
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:40,523
Whoo! Yeah!

209
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,076
Gosh, Doc. Didn't I tell you
to keep your thumb up?

210
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:58,577
- No!
- I'm sorry.

211
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,041
God!

212
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:05,882
I guess I'll just have to...
grow a new one.

213
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:12,248
Heh! Just a little
cowboy humor there, Wayne.

214
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,487
Yeah. Giddap!

215
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,288
Where you goin', Doc?

216
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,557
Oh, I just... I thought I might
go home and have a hot bath,

217
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,693
eat a little supper, have a hot
bath... Well, we got business in town.

218
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:58,466
There's a buyer interested in one of our prize
bulls, and if you intend to run Riata with me,

219
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:01,872
- I think maybe you better come along.
- Without a bath?

220
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:04,274
You got it, cowboy.

221
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:07,246
Bonanza was never like this.

222
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:23,489
Wayne, I want a good hand.

223
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:25,725
Yeah, I know you do.

224
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,792
Now, Orly, you weren't serious
when you offered 6,000...

225
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:31,997
for my prize-winnin' bull,
were you?

226
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:37,442
I heard rumors that bull's gone the way
of Hollywood, if you know what I mean.

227
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:42,676
Not true, Orly. Hell, half my
heifers are fightin'to get near him,

228
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,947
and the other half
just sit back and admire his work.

229
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,581
Now, don't ya think 7,500
would be a more Christian offer?

230
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:51,591
Hmm.

231
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,524
No, thanks.
I'll just stick with beer.

232
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:59,691
Part of bein' a cowboy is bein' able to hold
your liquor while you're holdin' your cards.

233
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,826
I said, no, thank you.
And I said drink it.

234
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:03,301
- Wayne!
- What?

235
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,430
Back off. Well, ante up, Doc.

236
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:10,273
You're losin'bad, and I ain't marryin'
no man who can't beat me at poker.

237
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:16,949
Tina and I met
over a poker table...

238
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:19,008
in Las Vegas.

239
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:23,352
I had a flush. She had a pair.

240
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:26,349
Oh, what a pair.

241
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:30,363
- Gimme two, Wayne.
- She ran out on me, Sam.

242
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,525
She took my second-most-favorite organ...

243
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:37,628
and stomped it to death
with her four-inch spike heels.

244
00:19:37,705 --> 00:19:42,199
- Coulda been worse.
- You tryin' to bluff us there, Doc?

245
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:51,743
You'll never guess who she ran off with...
Gooshie.

246
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:54,652
- Gooshie?
- Gooshie?

247
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:56,713
Yeah. G-G-Gooshie.

248
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,692
It's, uh, Navajo for...

249
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:03,853
I'll see ya.

250
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:06,661
You know,
you're wasting your money, Sam.

251
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:09,567
Three kings.
He's got a full boat, aces over eights.

252
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:11,571
Wayne?

253
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:16,235
Yeah. Two dollars and, uh,

254
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,244
two more.

255
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:20,678
He's cheating.

256
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:24,775
He took the best cards from the
last hand, three aces and two eights.

257
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:27,013
That's what he's got,
aces and eights.

258
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:28,117
What about it, Doc?

259
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:32,184
You gonna stare into space like a
castrated steer, or are you gonna call me?

260
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,625
- Can't beat a full boat.
- How do you know what I'm holding?

261
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:37,528
Because you're cheating.

262
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,739
- That's it.
- Hold it, Wayne.

263
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:52,472
Doc, you better know
what you're sayin'.

264
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:56,539
- I do. Tell them Wayne was palming,
- He was palming,

265
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:58,608
stacking, shifting,
stacking, shifting...

266
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:01,985
dealing seconds, dealing base,
dealing sides... cheating.

267
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,650
- Cheating.
- That's why I know...

268
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:08,388
that... he's got aces and eights.

269
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:13,458
I got a right to stomp him, Chance.
Not if he's tellin' the truth.

270
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:16,332
And there's an easy way to find out.

271
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:24,004
He was cheating, Sam. I swear it.

272
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:31,170
Uh, Wayne, look, I'm sorry.
I apologize. I just...

273
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:32,747
That ain't good enough.

274
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,515
Yes, it is.

275
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:39,159
Buy me a drink, Wayne.

276
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,130
Well, Orly, let's me and you
go talk a little bull. Eh, heh!

277
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:52,604
I'll hold the money.

278
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:56,140
Let's get something straight, Wayne.

279
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:59,112
This is my test, and I'm gonna win it
fair or I'm not gonna win it at all.

280
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:01,374
You gonna marry Doc?
I ain't marryin' no man.

281
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:04,349
You are if he wins.
Doc can't out cowboy me.

282
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:07,615
I don't know, Tess.
There's somethin' different about Doc.

283
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:09,679
Aces and eights.

284
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:13,783
That's a dead man's hand,
isn't it... isn't it?

285
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:18,362
Isn't it?
Yeah, it is.

286
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:27,100
Ah! Oh!
Turn over Tess's hand.

287
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:31,474
Forget it, Al. You were wrong.
Sam, turn over Tess's hand.

288
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,470
Come on!

289
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:39,484
See, I knew it... aces and eights.

290
00:22:39,553 --> 00:22:42,681
He was cheatin'.
He dealt 'em to her so she could beat you.

291
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:47,692
So that's how she's gonna play it.

292
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:07,474
You oughta take some salt tablets
and some water.

293
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:09,539
I ain't thirsty.

294
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:14,078
No sense killin' yourself.

295
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:16,952
You're two posts behind,
and there are only three holes left.

296
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:21,324
- I don't need no help!
- Oh, Women's Lib is gonna love you.

297
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:24,387
What's that?
Somethin' on the horizon,

298
00:23:24,465 --> 00:23:26,456
like that storm.

299
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:30,365
We'll beat it. It's an hour off.

300
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:40,436
Here.

301
00:23:40,514 --> 00:23:42,505
I ain't thirsty.

302
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:48,414
Tess,

303
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:50,650
you're pale,

304
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:54,660
you're hot,
and I'll bet nauseous.

305
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:58,095
I want you out of the sun.
I ain't no quitter.

306
00:23:58,165 --> 00:24:00,326
Look, nobody said you were.

307
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,632
It's just, there's some things that...
that a man can do better than a woman.

308
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:07,833
There ain't nothin' that
you can do better than me.

309
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:11,105
And there are some things that a woman can
do better than a man, like havin' babies.

310
00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:16,206
Babies? I ain't havin' no babies.

311
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:19,946
Isn't that why you're gettin' married, so you
can have children and keep Riata in the family?

312
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,318
I ain't gettin' married.

313
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:25,324
Well, you are if I can
keep up with you,

314
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:27,883
and, uh, I figure that
I'm ahead on points.

315
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,825
Come on. Let go of me! I ain't lettin' no man...

316
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:35,892
Whoop.

317
00:24:58,225 --> 00:25:03,629
Pard and me
Pardon me for loving you

318
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:12,504
What is it, Doc?

319
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:17,476
Heat exhaustion. Get me a half teaspoon of salt
in a quart of cold water, and get me a washcloth.

320
00:25:17,544 --> 00:25:19,535
All right.

321
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,700
Here you go, Doc. I got the well water
and salt like y'all... Oh, Lordy!

322
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:44,964
Pour me a glass.

323
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,037
She gonna be all right?
Soon as I get her cooled off...

324
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,840
and get some fluids in her,
she'll be fine.

325
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:55,074
Fetch me a fan, would ya?
All right.

326
00:25:55,148 --> 00:25:57,480
"Fetch. " I'm talkin' like them.

327
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,368
I'll go get the animals.

328
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:19,632
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

329
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:28,647
What happened?
I mentioned babies and you fainted.

330
00:26:28,715 --> 00:26:34,051
I swooned?
Well, yeah. Uh, drink this.

331
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:39,815
Salt water?
Just drink it, please.

332
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,188
Why'd you bring me here?

333
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:52,466
It's closer than your place. Now, just
drink a little bit more, and slowly.

334
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:56,198
That's it.

335
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,907
You... You man!

336
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:13,215
Oh, that's smart.

337
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:17,093
You're... You got heat prostration,
and you cover yourself up with a blanket.

338
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:20,998
Pass out again if you want to.
I'll just take off all of your clothes.

339
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:27,968
- Hi, Miss McGill. Feelin' any better?
- Hi, B...

340
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:33,439
Doc, if you don't mind...
I put the animals up.

341
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:36,744
I'd kinda like to get back.
Looks like it's gonna be a pretty big one.

342
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:39,718
Yeah, well it's fine by me.

343
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:42,619
Well, I better get home too.

344
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:47,353
Yeah, you're not goin' anywhere
for at least an hour.

345
00:27:47,427 --> 00:27:49,418
You, uh...

346
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,421
You want...

347
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:56,427
You want the boy to stay?

348
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:01,806
- No.
- Y'all take care now, you hear?

349
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:10,172
Thank you for trusting me.

350
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:14,379
I don't trust ya, Doc. I trust me.

351
00:28:24,464 --> 00:28:27,627
What's wrong with Piggy?

352
00:28:29,736 --> 00:28:32,000
She has allergies.

353
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,131
What?

354
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:39,838
Uh, she's allergic to something
on your ranch. She's fine here.

355
00:28:41,314 --> 00:28:43,805
Then you keep her.

356
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:48,617
Well, thank you, Tess.
That's, uh... That's mighty nice.

357
00:28:50,057 --> 00:28:54,187
Just payment for the doctorin' and
the loan of the clothes, that's all.

358
00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:59,355
Shh, shh, shh. Easy.

359
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:02,266
Easy, Piggy.
That ol' thunder can't hurt you.

360
00:29:03,804 --> 00:29:06,602
She can't understand you.

361
00:29:06,673 --> 00:29:10,165
I'm just usin' my voice to...
soothe her.

362
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:19,882
Thunder scares me.

363
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:24,856
Always has, always will.
I guess I'm no smarter than Piggy.

364
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:28,417
There's no sin in bein' afraid.
It is in Texas.

365
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:35,327
Well, I think the worst is over.

366
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:41,166
You wanna dance?

367
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:43,266
What?

368
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:45,402
Dance.

369
00:29:51,016 --> 00:29:52,816
I don't dance.

370
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,660
No!

371
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:38,249
What did I do?

372
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,863
It's not what you did.
It's what you're gonna do.

373
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:41,867
I ain't gonna lose in here
what I won out there.

374
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:44,961
I didn't think dancing
was part of the contest.

375
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:46,437
Everything's part of the contest, Doc,

376
00:30:46,438 --> 00:30:49,566
and so far you ain't been able to keep up
with me at anything except posthole diggin'!

377
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:53,636
And poker.
I figure I'm ahead in poker.

378
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:02,517
I didn't know Wayne
was gonna do that.

379
00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:09,418
I'm-I'm glad you weren't in on it.

380
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:16,099
So...
So...

381
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:20,902
Uh, the way I see it, I bested you
in ropin', wranglin' and drinkin',

382
00:31:20,974 --> 00:31:23,807
and you got a leg up on me...

383
00:31:23,877 --> 00:31:28,246
in poker, posthole diggin'
and dancin'.

384
00:31:28,315 --> 00:31:32,718
Sounds like a tie to me. Contest
wasn't to tie me. It was to beat me.

385
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:35,084
Well, I still have tomorrow.
Tomorrow's Sunday,

386
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:40,320
and, unless you intend to out pray me,
you just lost, Doc.

387
00:31:40,393 --> 00:31:42,554
Look, Tess.

388
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:44,756
Come on.
You owe me a tiebreaker.

389
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:52,101
Okay. One last test.

390
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:57,007
Shoot.
You want to marry me, Doc?

391
00:31:57,077 --> 00:31:59,068
Ride Widowmaker.

392
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,941
That's what I thought.

393
00:32:33,747 --> 00:32:36,648
I like you, too, Piggy. Yeah.

394
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,643
Funny thing is...

395
00:32:41,755 --> 00:32:45,589
Till we danced, I didn't realize
how much I liked her.

396
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:13,042
Tess!

397
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:19,625
I'm comin', Chance.
The Lord has waited all week for...

398
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:23,390
Ain't that Doc
and Widowmaker down there?

399
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:29,092
Al, Widowmaker.

400
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:31,160
Oh, hello, Widowmaker.

401
00:33:32,205 --> 00:33:37,336
Do you know where she and that
jockstrap breath went over the weekend?

402
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:42,074
To Vegas. Can you believe it? Our Vegas. Al.

403
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:46,551
If that Tina came to me on her knees...
on her knees and begged me,

404
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:49,816
I wouldn't give her the sweat off of my... Al.

405
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,691
Oh, uh, you want me
to control the horse.

406
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,194
Please.

407
00:33:56,262 --> 00:33:59,026
- Hey, Doc, you crazy?
- Ask Tess.

408
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:03,559
He's gonna get himself killed.
Is this here part of the contest?

409
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:05,831
This is the contest.

410
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:08,703
Come on, boys!
He's gonna try her again!

411
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:12,006
Ohhmmm.

412
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:14,638
- You ready? Al?
- Ohhmmm.

413
00:34:14,714 --> 00:34:16,875
- Al?
- Yeah, yeah. Get on. Go ahead.

414
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:20,044
Ohhmmm.

415
00:34:25,825 --> 00:34:28,123
Ohhmmm... What?

416
00:34:28,194 --> 00:34:32,961
No, I'm busy right now.
Ohhmmm.

417
00:34:33,032 --> 00:34:36,024
- No, I can't come to the phone right now.
- Al.

418
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:38,969
Ohhmmm... Who is it?

419
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:42,100
Tina? Uh, um...

420
00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:46,407
Uh, just... just stay right there
for a while, uh, Sam.

421
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:49,277
I'll be right back, huh?
Yeah. Just...

422
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:51,340
Just...

423
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:56,345
Yee-aa-aah!

424
00:35:01,728 --> 00:35:03,628
Ride him, Doc!

425
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:07,462
- Come on.
- Come on, Doc.

426
00:35:08,468 --> 00:35:09,992
Come on, Doc.
Come on, Doc.

427
00:35:12,305 --> 00:35:14,933
Come on, Doc!
Ride him!

428
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:19,609
- Ride him, Doc!
- Come on, Doc!

429
00:35:33,693 --> 00:35:36,924
- God dang!
- All right. I seen some ridin' out there.

430
00:35:36,996 --> 00:35:39,658
Good ride, Doc.

431
00:35:39,732 --> 00:35:43,133
Good ride. You know, I think
Widowmaker could use a new name.

432
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:47,299
- Welcome to the family, son.
- Thanks, but no thanks. I just, uh...

433
00:35:47,373 --> 00:35:51,537
I wanted to see if I could ride him,
not her.

434
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,157
Oh, now, now, daughter.

435
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:16,134
I guess the laugh's on me.
Nobody's laughin', Tess.

436
00:36:16,202 --> 00:36:18,432
They better not.

437
00:36:18,505 --> 00:36:21,167
Go after him.

438
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,232
Chase a man?

439
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:28,508
A calf has to be roped before you can
put your brand on him. Why not a man?

440
00:36:28,581 --> 00:36:30,572
It'd be humiliating.

441
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:34,177
Any more than what you've
been doin' to Doc this past week?

442
00:36:34,254 --> 00:36:38,816
Tess, for once in your life, act
like a woman instead of a cowboy.

443
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:41,190
Hmm?

444
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,424
You gotta trust me, Doc.

445
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:49,696
I'm doin' what I think is best.

446
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:52,966
Winning a contest isn't enough.
I mean, she's gotta want...

447
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:55,371
You always talk to yourself,
Doc?

448
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:58,435
You always...

449
00:36:58,511 --> 00:37:01,674
come into a man's house
without knocking?

450
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:03,841
Sorry.

451
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:06,385
You oughta wear a dress more often.

452
00:37:06,452 --> 00:37:08,545
Kinda hard to work a ranch
wearin' a dress.

453
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:11,488
- Don't you ever back off?
- Can't afford to.

454
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:16,110
Oh, yeah, I forgot. You're a Texan, and
Texans gotta be tougher than rawhide.

455
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,394
What do you want, Tess?

456
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:20,899
Well, I was just wonderin'...

457
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:25,563
...why you risked your life
for 50,000 acres of prime Texas land...

458
00:37:25,638 --> 00:37:26,849
and then turned it down.

459
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,472
Is that what you think this
is about? Getting Riata?

460
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:33,911
- Well, it sure as hell ain't about love.
- You speakin' for me or for yourself?

461
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:41,886
Doc, in all the years
we've known each other,

462
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:45,391
the only thing we ever talked
about was sick critters.

463
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:52,789
- Okay, uh, how about those Dodgers?
- What?

464
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:58,303
Look, Tess, it's hard to talk to you
about anything except Riata.

465
00:37:58,371 --> 00:38:03,604
Especially if, uh...
I mean, if a fella's shy.

466
00:38:03,676 --> 00:38:06,873
You never struck me as bein' shy. Well, I was.

467
00:38:06,946 --> 00:38:09,881
At least I was when
it came to expressing...

468
00:38:10,883 --> 00:38:13,113
my feelings for you.

469
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:17,245
So, uh,

470
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:21,253
I wrote 'em all down.

471
00:38:54,494 --> 00:38:56,792
This isn't fair, you know.

472
00:38:56,863 --> 00:38:59,923
You can't expect me to do this
and not get involved.

473
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:02,900
So if Tess falls in love with Doc,

474
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:07,338
I'd appreciate it if you'd just
leap me outta here as soon as possible.

475
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:14,870
Doc.

476
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:19,781
Can we dance?

477
00:39:19,852 --> 00:39:21,843
Sure.

478
00:39:38,137 --> 00:39:43,632
Doc, Riata's in my blood.
I just can't give her up.

479
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,905
Nobody's askin' you to.

480
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:50,540
But if I marry you, then all the men'll
look to you after Chance is gone.

481
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,246
Couldn't we run it together?

482
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,951
Together?

483
00:40:03,963 --> 00:40:05,954
Together.

484
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,513
<i>Tess! Tess McGill!</i>

485
00:40:24,584 --> 00:40:27,451
<i>I know you're in there.!</i>

486
00:40:28,154 --> 00:40:30,918
Wayne, what're you doin' here?

487
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,584
I wanna know if you're marryin' Doc.

488
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:36,958
Well, that's none
of your damn business.

489
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:39,554
Now, Tess, I figure it is.

490
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:43,763
I ain't been bustin' my butt for you all
these years to have you go run off with Doc.

491
00:40:43,836 --> 00:40:46,304
You were paid for every day you worked,
and plenty you didn't.

492
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:50,172
Do you think I worked at Riata for
three squares and 50 bucks a month?

493
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:57,779
I ain't some bowlegged cowboy
like Eddie or Zeke.

494
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:01,911
I... I was hopin' some day to rope you.

495
00:41:01,988 --> 00:41:04,821
- You mean Riata.
- You can keep Riata.

496
00:41:08,394 --> 00:41:10,862
I want you.

497
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,921
What?

498
00:41:20,206 --> 00:41:22,470
I love you, Tess.

499
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:24,942
I have ever since
the first day I rode in.

500
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:27,002
Just...

501
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:32,243
Just never had the guts to say so.

502
00:41:34,587 --> 00:41:37,215
But I wrote these letters.

503
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,341
Would you mind
if I danced with Wayne...

504
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:09,219
just to see how it feels?

505
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:15,358
Uh...
No. Sure.

506
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:21,923
Uh...

507
00:42:25,004 --> 00:42:28,371
I don't know how to dance, Tess.

508
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:32,070
That's okay. I'll lead.

509
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:46,152
<i>Wayne danced about as well as I did... </i>

510
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:50,559
<i>with Miss Morgan</i>
<i>at my kindergarten graduation. </i>

511
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:55,761
<i>She married the principal that summer, and I
didn't get over it until I met Miss Sedlack. </i>

512
00:42:55,835 --> 00:43:00,033
<i>She was my first-grade teacher. </i>

513
00:43:00,106 --> 00:43:03,564
<i>I hoped getting over Tess</i>
<i>wouldn't take as long. </i>

514
00:43:07,513 --> 00:43:09,981
At least you're still my girl.

515
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:12,643
Oop.

516
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,709
That's it.

517
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:21,555
- Fickle.
- You're lookin'pretty sharp, Sam.

518
00:43:24,864 --> 00:43:28,630
Oh, hello. I love those silver tips
on your boots. Those are nice.

519
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:33,900
And, oh, you've got matching ones
on your collar. Ha-ha! "Trés" western.

520
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:38,000
Oh, come on, Sam. Gimme a break.
I knew you could ride that nag.

521
00:43:38,077 --> 00:43:44,016
Nag? You call that half ton of Texas
lightning that tried to castrate me a nag?

522
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:46,643
Yeah, but he didn't.
You rode him, cowboy!

523
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:49,187
Oh, gee, shucks, Mr. Dillon.

524
00:43:49,255 --> 00:43:53,453
Sam, if I hadn't taken that phone call,
I would have lost Tina forever.

525
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:55,517
She's back?
Yeah.

526
00:43:55,594 --> 00:44:00,224
She gave Gooshie a case
of mouthwash and sent him packing.

527
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:03,097
She only did it
to make me jealous.

528
00:44:03,169 --> 00:44:06,764
And-And she never slept
with that rotten bum.

529
00:44:10,176 --> 00:44:12,974
I believe her.
You believed Ziggy.

530
00:44:13,045 --> 00:44:15,741
Well, technically Ziggy wasn't wrong.

531
00:44:15,815 --> 00:44:19,876
He said he predicted Tess would marry
someone who wrote her love letters.

532
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:22,113
You're right, Al.
Yeah. Of course.

533
00:44:22,188 --> 00:44:24,349
I can't blame Ziggy.
No.

534
00:44:24,423 --> 00:44:27,358
I mean, you were the one who said
I had to marry her to leap. Me?

535
00:44:27,426 --> 00:44:30,554
Yeah, you.
I don't know that I ever said that.

536
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:34,793
I do. Well, I, uh... You know,
I never really believed it.

537
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:37,859
You didn't, huh?
Did you?

538
00:44:39,105 --> 00:44:41,437
Come here. Come here.

539
00:44:41,507 --> 00:44:43,498
What?
Look in here.

540
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,970
Check it out.

541
00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:52,040
Go on.

542
00:44:57,189 --> 00:45:00,249
You had a lot to overcome, Sam.

543
00:45:04,196 --> 00:45:06,187
Hi, Doc.

544
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:17,035
Could you just once use the door?

545
00:45:22,782 --> 00:45:24,773
Happy?
Thank you.

546
00:45:27,153 --> 00:45:30,418
Best man's lookin'real sharp.
Sharp indeed.

547
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:33,219
Thanks, son.

548
00:45:34,393 --> 00:45:38,090
Uh, Tess getting married might still
be your ticket out of here.

549
00:45:38,164 --> 00:45:40,394
Ziggy's sayin' there's
a 50-50 chance...

550
00:45:40,466 --> 00:45:44,300
that you'll leap the minute
she says, "I do. " Ziggy.

551
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,361
Uh, you seen Piggy?

552
00:45:46,439 --> 00:45:49,234
She's around here someplace.
You want me to go find her?

553
00:45:49,235 --> 00:45:50,705
No, that's okay. I'll look.

554
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:52,767
Piggy?

555
00:45:54,246 --> 00:45:56,237
Piggy.

556
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,482
<i>Piggy</i>

557
00:46:01,487 --> 00:46:03,921

565
00:46:24,643 --> 00:46:28,943
Why don't you go ahead and try it? Buddy.

566
00:46:29,014 --> 00:46:31,574
Yeah, Doc?

567
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:36,519
Uh, why don't you try "Peggy Sue"?
It might sound a little better.

568
00:46:36,589 --> 00:46:38,580
All right.

569
00:46:43,462 --> 00:46:46,363
