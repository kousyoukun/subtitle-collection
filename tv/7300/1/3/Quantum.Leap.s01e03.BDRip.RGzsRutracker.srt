1
00:00:02,854 --> 00:00:05,823
<i>It all started when a time
travel experiment I was conducting...</i>

2
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:08,824
<i>went... a little caca.</i>

3
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:12,384
<i>In the blink of a cosmic
clock, I went from quantum physicist,</i>

4
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:15,830
<i>to air force test pilot,</i>

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,629
<i>which could have been
fun if I knew how to fly.</i>

6
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:21,968
<i>Fortunately, I had help, an
observer from the project named Al.</i>

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,065
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram, so
all he can lend is moral support.</i>

8
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:29,135
<i>Anyway, here I am, bouncing
around in time,</i>

9
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:31,306
<i>putting things right that once went wrong,</i>

10
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:35,250
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone
Ranger with Al as my Tonto,</i>

11
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:37,844
<i>and I don't even need a mask.</i>

12
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:40,789
Oh, boy.

13
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,036
<i>The trouble with quantum
leaping is that just about the time...</i>

14
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:02,629
<i>I start to enjoy being a hero,</i>

15
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:06,233
<i>the big guy with the remote control
switches channels on me.</i>

16
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,661
<i>Now all I have to do is
figure out who I am...</i>

17
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,663
<i>where I am,</i>

18
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,723
<i>and why all these young
women are staring at me...</i>

19
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,258
<i>as if I were Tom Cruise.</i>

20
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,771
- Where, Where was I?
- You were explaining...

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,206
Heathcliff's obsession with Catherine.

22
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:42,277
Right. Right, right.

23
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:47,340
Heathcliff's obsession, uh, with Catherine...

24
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,545
in, uh, uh,

25
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:54,156
Oh. Wuthering Heights, of course.

26
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:57,853
Dr. Bryant, do you
think Heathcliff's obsession...

27
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:02,831
stems from Brontes own tragic
yearning for Bramwell?

28
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:08,164
I think the woman was
sexually suppressed. Far out, man.

29
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,140
You think she wrote this because
she was horny? Right on!

30
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:17,646
Great. Four of my least favorite clichés.

31
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:20,945
Headbands, bell bottoms, flower
power and English Lit.

32
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:23,850
What do you think, Dr. Bryant?

33
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:28,551
Uh, well, I-I,

34
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:34,828
It's an interesting and,
and a difficult question.

35
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,968
Uh, and one we'll have
to discuss tomorrow. No way.

36
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:42,198
No Friday classes in summer school.

37
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:44,537
Right? Oh, yes. Uh,

38
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:22,745
Dr. Bryant.! Dr. Bryant.!

39
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:27,341
Oh. I've been trying to get a moment
alone with you all afternoon.

40
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,819
Uh, uh, Jamie-Lee, um,

41
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:33,151
W
- what can I do for you?

42
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:35,920
"Give me life, my darling.

43
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:41,391
Touch my hand and light my soul."

44
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,331
- Keats?
- No.

45
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:49,066
Your lecture on expressing love.

46
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,576
My, I wanna go home.

47
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:55,874
You live this way.

48
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,512
Jamie-Lee, um,

49
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:04,952
I'm a teacher and you're a
student, so no fraternizing.

50
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:08,286
That's not what you said last night.

51
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:10,451
I didn't? No.

52
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:16,627
Donna.

53
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:21,363
Of course. This is Lawrence.!

54
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,999
Where are you going? After,

55
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:29,478
To the Rathskeller.

56
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:32,276
They're closed between 4.00
and 6.00 in the summer.

57
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:36,581
She's going in. Donna Eleese works there.

58
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:44,084
Jerry, we have to talk. It's
a matter of life and death.

59
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,095
I'll put the tea on. Jamie-Lee,

60
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:48,893
I don't think it's a good
idea for you to be in my rooms.

61
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:56,930
What's wrong? Everything.

62
00:05:57,007 --> 00:06:00,499
Oh, don't say that.

63
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,978
I know there's a solution.

64
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:08,177
I believe our love will conquer all, even Daddy.

65
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:12,144
You gotta be kidding!

66
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,055
No, I'm not.

67
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:19,190
I did it.

68
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:21,959
I told Daddy everything.

69
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:25,968
From that first blush of love...

70
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:29,437
to that glorious night in the bell tower.

71
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:36,543
Daddy was furious and threatened to have you
horsewhipped within an inch of your life.

72
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:39,310
Oscar said he'd kill you with his bare hands.

73
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:43,978
- Oscar?
- A Neanderthal who goes to Ohio State.

74
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:48,115
He wants to pin me.

75
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,519
Oh, Jerry!

76
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,653
Precious!

77
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,178
It's all so like Romeo and Juliet.

78
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,273
Great. Men wanna horsewhip and kill me,

79
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,442
and you're playing Juliet.

80
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,387
Juliet committed suicide. Suicide?

81
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:24,018
Oh, yes!

82
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:26,927
Of course!

83
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,930
A love pact!

84
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,365
Sam, we don't want that to happen, do we?

85
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:35,632
No. Uh, Jamie-Lee,

86
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,300
we are not committing suicide.

87
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,968
What else is there to do?

88
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:47,307
Have a cup of tea.

89
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,884
Precisely what Jane and Edward would have done.

90
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,725
Jane and Edward?

91
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:03,062
Oh, uh, Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester.

92
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,829
Charlotte Brontes star-crossed lovers.

93
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:10,035
How can you teach English literature
if you don't know that?

94
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:14,435
But, anyway, we're gonna get
you out of this one quick this time.

95
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:17,605
Ziggy figures a 99.5% chance
- I don't want out of this one quick.

96
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,615
You'll be able to leap when, What?

97
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:22,947
Hark, my sweetie pie.

98
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25,454
Jamie-Lee, I want you to take this cup of tea...

99
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:27,456
and go straight back to your dorm.

100
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:29,457
You call your father and Oswald
- Oscar.

101
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:31,459
Whatever. Tell them it was all a joke.

102
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:34,621
You made it up because you missed them
and wanted to get their attention.

103
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:37,131
But it's not a joke.

104
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:39,965
Ohhh. Oh, yes, it is.

105
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:43,130
It's the school, isn't it?

106
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,640
You're afraid of losing your tenure.

107
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,643
I'm afraid of losing my life.

108
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:51,647
If it comes to that, so be it.

109
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:56,481
Our love can live without these temporal bodies.

110
00:08:57,488 --> 00:09:01,322
Uh, Romeo and Juliet?

111
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:04,087
Lancelot and Guinevere.

112
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:09,932
Uh, Jamie-Lee, we, uh, w-we
can play Lancelot and Guinevere...

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,933
some other time.

114
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:15,096
When, my darling?

115
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:20,109
When, uh, the-the moon...

116
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:22,610
has crested over the...

117
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,443
towers of Camelot.

118
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,956
"When the moon has crested
over the towers of Camelot?"

119
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:40,792
I know. It's... You better watch it, Sam.

120
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:43,957
You're gonna end up marrying her too.

121
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:47,697
They got married? June 20th, 1972.

122
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,969
Nice little intimate shotgun
wedding, 12-gauge, I think it was.

123
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,975
That's what you're here for...

124
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:56,979
is to see that those two don't
ruin both their lives.

125
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,811
Of course, there's not much more that
could go wrong with Professor Bryant's.

126
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:03,318
That's not why I'm here. Oh?

127
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:05,480
I'm here to get a second chance,

128
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:08,649
before I even get a first one.

129
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,388
You wanna let me in on the joke?

130
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,890
Donna Eleese is here.

131
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,799
That's not funny, Sam. But true.

132
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,996
Don't you see, Al? I'm here to
get Donna and I a second chance.

133
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:24,437
You're here to see that Guinevere there...

134
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:26,442
doesn't make the biggest mistake of her life!

135
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:27,437
How do you know that?

136
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:29,604
Ziggy's got it computed down
to the decimal point!

137
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,011
I don't give a damn what a computer says!

138
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:34,174
We're talking about the
woman I love and my future.

139
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,017
I'm here. She's here. We've got a second chance.

140
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:42,053
And no one's gonna stop me from taking it.

141
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,253
Not even you.

142
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,143
Sam, you're breaking your own inside trader rule.

143
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:54,696
What?

144
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:56,965
Quantum leap rule numero uno.

145
00:10:57,038 --> 00:11:00,634
The time traveler shall not take
advantage of his position...

146
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,802
to improve or alter his life.

147
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,812
- I made that rule?
- Yes.

148
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,250
And you swore everyone to a blood oath
of allegiance to it on penalty of death.

149
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:12,719
- Ah, that's my interpretation.
- If I made the rule, I can rescind it.

150
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:13,392
So ordered.

151
00:11:13,393 --> 00:11:16,849
Not without committee approval,
and Weitzman will never give it.

152
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,486
Weitzman? Short fat guy, uh, in knickers? Mm.

153
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:23,053
Tall skinny guy with a stovepipe hat.

154
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:26,431
He's got at Lincoln fixation
and he also controls the committee,

155
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:29,664
and he wants you declared non compos mentis.

156
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,605
Let him. In case you haven't noticed, Al,

157
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:36,167
the committee doesn't run
this project or me anymore.

158
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:01,701
Pretty straight for the '70s.

159
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,568
Of course, this is a Catholic girls' college,

160
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,636
- Look at you.
- Uh, it's psychedelic.

161
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,644
It must be the black light or something.

162
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:13,147
You look like a ghost.

163
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:17,119
Look. There she is. There's Donna.

164
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,450
Oh, my God. It is her.

165
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:21,922
Now do you believe me? Donna's here. I'm here.

166
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,754
Fate has put us together again.

167
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:28,091
When I saw her today, I
couldn't believe it. She's so young.

168
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:33,158
When we first met, she'd just left the
Star Bright Project and was turning 30.

169
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:37,432
Don't do this, Sam. The
wedding was on the fifth of June...

170
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:40,600
at Old Mission Chapel.

171
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,836
It was hot and I was sweating,

172
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:47,008
but, you know, it was more from nerves
than from the heat and then,

173
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:52,183
Everybody went home, because...

174
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,982
I didn't show up for the wedding.

175
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:00,789
No. No, you showed up. She didn't.

176
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,024
It had something to do with her father.

177
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,192
He didn't die, did he? I wouldn't know.

178
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:09,293
And if I did, I couldn't tell you. I
broke the rules before giving you personal data,

179
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,636
and if I do it again, the committee's threatening
to remove me from the project.

180
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:16,667
They can't remove you. You're
the only contact they have with me.

181
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,804
Al, I want you to run a,

182
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:24,243
Chicken.

183
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:39,426
She smelled the same.

184
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:41,765
Of course, I didn't.

185
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:45,407
God, how I wanted to tell her I'm not
the boozed-out professor she sees,

186
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,536
that I was her Sam,

187
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:49,270
the man she'll love 10 years from now,

188
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:51,278
that I'm doing what we dreamed of,

189
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,315
I'm traveling in time.

190
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:56,111
What can I get for you, Dr. Bryant?

191
00:13:56,184 --> 00:13:59,552
- Uh, an avion,
Evian. - A what?

192
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:02,113
Uh, C-Coke. Uh, a Coke would be fine.

193
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:04,716
A Coke, cheeseburger and
fries, medium rare on the burger,

194
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:07,660
Hold the tomato, extra onion.

195
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:19,668
She knew. She knew how I liked my burger.

196
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:22,073
Shove that up your gauge circuit, Ziggy.

197
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,912
Thank you. Uh, Donna,

198
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:31,076
um, could I talk with you?

199
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:33,245
Oh, I really don't have time, Dr. Bryant.

200
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,552
Oh, yeah. I'll, um, uh,

201
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,888
Maybe, Well, I'll just wait till you finish work.

202
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,985
Dr, Bryant, please, um,

203
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:43,258
I'm quite capable of
getting an "A" in your class...

204
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,596
by simply doing the work.

205
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:47,601
No. No. No, no.

206
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:50,104
No, tha-that's, that's not what I'm saying.

207
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:53,369
Donna, I'm not what I look like.

208
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:55,841
If you look into my eyes, you can see that.

209
00:14:56,846 --> 00:15:00,441
- Is this your best line?
- It's not a line.

210
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:07,587
If you look into my
eyes, you'll see another soul.

211
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:12,453
- You've had too much to drink.
- I haven't had a drop.

212
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:28,743
This is silly. Yeah. So it's silly.

213
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,907
Do it anyway.

214
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:47,095
Please don't talk to me anymore,
Dr. Bryant. Donna.

215
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,419
Hey.! I thought I told
you to leave my girl alone.

216
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,936
Donna's your girl? Jamie-Lee's my girl.

217
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:56,937
Oscar.

218
00:15:57,005 --> 00:16:00,270
Yeah, Oscar, and he's here to break your face.

219
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:06,712
Look, Oscar, why don't we
just talk about this man-to-man?

220
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:10,717
If you don't like what you
hear, you can always break my face.

221
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:16,220
Good. First, Jamie-Lee is crazy about you.

222
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:20,388
Yeah, right. And that's why all she
can talk about is her precious Jerry.

223
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:24,899
Which... Which proves my point. See, if
she was crazy about me, she'd never mention me.

224
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:28,027
But since she's really crazy about
you, all she does is talk about me.

225
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:33,471
She's trying to make you jealous.
Well, it's working.

226
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,600
Oscar,

227
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:39,746
Jamie-Lee once told me that...

228
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:43,750
you were the only man who
ever made the earth move for her.

229
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:47,378
Yeah? Yeah.

230
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:52,350
That ain't what she told me.

231
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,918
Isn't.

232
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:58,966
Of course not. See, she's
frustrated with you. She,

233
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:03,033
She thinks you want her only for her body.

234
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,096
Oh, she's got a great body.

235
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:08,369
She also has a mind, Oscar.

236
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:12,210
Oscar. A deeply poetic mind.

237
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,374
And if you want her to love you,

238
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,715
you gotta let the romantic side of you free.

239
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,619
Romantic side of me? I-Isn't
Jamie-Lee in your thoughts night and day?

240
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,124
Yeah, except for wrestling practice.

241
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,786
Well, tell her that, but don't mention
the wrestling practice stuff.

242
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:33,857
Take to a romantic movie, a candlelit
dinner, read her a poem.

243
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:37,064
I did. You did?

244
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:41,909
There once was a young man from Kent...

245
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,809
- Oscar, limericks aren't
exactly what I had in mind.

246
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,575
Look, read her a romantic poet,

247
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,913
Kelly, Sheets
- Keats. I don't know.

248
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:51,748
What do you mean you don't know? You're the prof.

249
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:53,810
I mean, the choice is yours.

250
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:57,086
Tell her how beautiful she is,

251
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,683
how her perfume drives you crazy,

252
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:02,094
how you can't get her eyes out of your mind.

253
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:06,463
And her lips. How
- How wet and how juicy they are.

254
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:09,196
Perfect.

255
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,901
That's mush. I can't talk
mush. To guys, it's mush.

256
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:16,375
To women, it's romantic.

257
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:19,278
Look, Oscar, Jamie-Lee
doesn't want a broken-down lit prof.

258
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:22,214
She wants a young football hero
- Wrestling!

259
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:26,778
Wrestling hero who'll be a little mushy.

260
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,124
Dr. Bryant, I love Jamie-Lee so much...

261
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:34,526
I'm willing to try anything.

262
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:38,065
But I think you're feeding me a line of crap.

263
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:43,036
And if this don't work, you can
expect me to be back to break your face.

264
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,376
That might help.

265
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:05,285
Where's Donna? She wasn't feeling
hot, so she went home.

266
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:10,025
Did you want tomatoes on this? They didn't put
tomatoes on 'em, but I can get tomatoes for you.

267
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:13,192
Did you want tomatoes? You know what else?
I was looking at the class schedule,

268
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:18,035
Muskie has 156 delegates
pledged to him and many endorsements.

269
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,904
Muskie met with McGovern today in Washington.

270
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:24,707
If the party can stand on, it'll
be successful this fall.

271
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,873
But we didn't talk about the
matter of endorsements.

272
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:29,884
Would you like his support before you
go to the convention? I would love it.

273
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:35,214
The United States Military Command in Saigon...

274
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:38,817
said today that yesterday's air
attacks over North Vietnam were the heaviest,

275
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:43,565
There was a time when I cared
about politics and the making of history,

276
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:46,567
but the big picture seemed unimportant...

277
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:49,229
next to getting a chance for
Donna and I in the future.

278
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:55,241
Bryant had summed up my feelings with a thought.

279
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:59,405
"Between love and the noblest
cause, there should be no contest.

280
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:03,246
Love is life's only true satisfaction."

281
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:06,651
Yoo-hoo.! Lancelot.!

282
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:12,919
The fires burn deep, my knight,

283
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:16,259
as passion roars within me.

284
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,097
Riddled with guilt, yet desperate for your loins,

285
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,298
your Guinevere has arrived!

286
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:25,771
Oh, boy.

287
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,866
I get the feeling that you brought
this one on yourself.

288
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:31,241
Where have you been? Waiting...

289
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,907
for the moon to crest over Camelot.

290
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:37,041
See what I mean?

291
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:40,611
- You're not dressed.
- I wasn't expecting guests.

292
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:44,557
But you promised to be Lancelot next.

293
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,719
Next?

294
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:54,493
Sam, there's all kinds of kinky stuff in here.!

295
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,799
There's leather stuff. There's a Roman toga.

296
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:59,807
There's rubber stuff in here.! Jamie-Lee,

297
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,402
don't you have more
important things to do, like homework?

298
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:06,971
I'm trying to work on my "A" in English Lit.

299
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:10,746
Oh, my God.! Sam, you gotta see this.!

300
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:13,583
Jamie-Lee, you gotta forget about me.

301
00:21:13,654 --> 00:21:16,749
You gotta start thinking
about other men, like, like Oscar.

302
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:20,760
He's just a boy. That
boy wanted to break my face.

303
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:24,423
He wanted to defend my honor?

304
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,763
Uh, define "honor"?

305
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:29,098
Oscar's willing to kill for you.

306
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:32,105
Don't you think you should
at least give him a chance?

307
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:34,506
But he's so stiff,

308
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:38,336
so unromantic.

309
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:43,785
Not anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if Oscar
started reading you romantic poetry.

310
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,012
Oscar? Oscar.

311
00:21:48,257 --> 00:21:53,285
Look, believe me,
Jamie-Lee. He's the one for you,

312
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,296
not me.

313
00:21:55,364 --> 00:22:00,300
Ah. You're both young. You got
your whole life in front of you.

314
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:03,736
Uh, tell her they're both gonna
grow up to be yuppies. Give him a chance.

315
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:07,240
They're gonna eat pasta and
drive B.M.W's with, uh, fuzzy seats.

316
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:10,903
Well, if you think I should,

317
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:16,143
Al, Donna,

318
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:19,311
But it won't affect my love for you!

319
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:24,182
Peace.

320
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,922
Al, Donna knew how I wanted my cheeseburger.

321
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:37,169
What? She looked into my eyes,
and she knew it was me.

322
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:42,940
Well, how could she know it was you when
she doesn't meet you for 12 years?

323
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,105
We're star-crossed souls. That uncrossed.

324
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:49,616
Well, you know, I've been working
on that, and I think I can fix it.

325
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:52,619
But I have to locate her father, and I was
- No.

326
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:56,852
Al. Al, couldn't you
- No. No, no. No! No! I can't help you, Sam.

327
00:22:56,924 --> 00:22:59,951
If I even try, they're gonna pull
the plug, and they're not kidding.

328
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,961
Weitzman is at the foundation right now...

329
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:03,894
arguing for the authority to do it.

330
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,298
You've broken your rules. You've
broken their rules. You've broken our rules.

331
00:23:07,368 --> 00:23:10,736
You gotta stop thinking with your
heart and start thinking with your noggin.

332
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,740
Is that what you'd do?

333
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:16,743
If, Hey. If some woman stood me up
at the altar, it's 'Adios, amigos."

334
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,906
Actually, uh, I wish a couple of them had.

335
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,756
Don't give me that sick puppy look.

336
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,585
Stop it. I'll never scratch
you behind the ears again.

337
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,653
Now, stop it.

338
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,093
Donna's father was career military. Shh. No. Sam,

339
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:43,762
Uh, he was in the army, I think. Sam. Sa... No.

340
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,497
No.

341
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:07,020
Bunsen burners, there's no other smell like it.

342
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:11,029
They are the common denominator
that make all science departments equal.

343
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:14,864
My life's blood, and I'm
trapped in Mr. English Lit.

344
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:16,925
There's no justice.

345
00:24:46,732 --> 00:24:47,508
Thanks.

346
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:50,759
You forgot Hubble's
Constant and, uh, the red shift.

347
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:53,101
Right.

348
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:56,903
Your calculations are in the right direction.
You're just not applying your astrophysics.

349
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:00,278
Expanding universe.

350
00:25:00,346 --> 00:25:03,316
Ever read Lemaitre's "Primeval Atom?"

351
00:25:03,383 --> 00:25:05,442
No.

352
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,147
"Then came the explosion, followed by
the filling of the heavens with smoke.

353
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:12,856
"We come to late to do no more than...

354
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,622
visualize the splendor of creation's birthday."

355
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:17,628
It's beautiful.

356
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:19,688
It's the poetry of physics.

357
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:23,361
Why do you know so much about this?

358
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:25,733
Uh, well, I read a lot.

359
00:25:25,805 --> 00:25:28,535
Pretty heady reading,

360
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:32,202
Einstein and Lemaitre, not to mention the math.

361
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:34,372
What lured you into it?

362
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,144
Guess I just wanna know why things happen to us.

363
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:41,550
Don't you think you have a choice?

364
00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:43,645
Do you?

365
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:45,656
Well, I used to. I'm not sure anymore.

366
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:49,058
Well, if we did have a choice,

367
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:51,393
I sure would've made things
happen a lot differently.

368
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,695
Who knows, maybe I'll go back
in time and change it.

369
00:25:59,506 --> 00:26:02,566
- What, you think that's silly?
- No, no. It...

370
00:26:04,477 --> 00:26:07,037
If you could travel back in
time, when would you go back to?

371
00:26:09,082 --> 00:26:12,711
When I was happiest, maybe
six or seven years old.

372
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:16,449
- Before your father left you?
- How did you know about that?

373
00:26:19,593 --> 00:26:21,209
I guess somebody told me.

374
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,859
Well, nobody could've told you
because I never told anyone.

375
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:28,366
- Who the hell are you?
- Just a friend.

376
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:34,534
Look, Donna, it was just a guess. Please.

377
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:39,203
Please. I noticed you didn't list
a father on your school record,

378
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:41,212
and you went by your mother's maiden name.

379
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,614
- What were you doing in my records?
- You're in my class.

380
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,452
Let's just keep it at that.

381
00:26:55,528 --> 00:26:57,621
I have a string theory on time.

382
00:26:57,697 --> 00:27:02,759
It's very complex and completely improvable,
but I'd like your opinion.

383
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:07,671
It's based on an expanding but finite universe.
Well, the universe is infinite.

384
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,473
Maybe not, and if not, then time is finite too.

385
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:15,809
- I have to go to the library.
- It's a nice public place.

386
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:02,385
But only in his own lifetime?

387
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:06,492
Well, that-that's the way I see it.

388
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:09,160
Ohhh. I think I'm getting a headache.

389
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,169
Yeah, well, it's kind of a lot to,

390
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:13,500
Oh, no! Stacy's gonna be here in 10 minutes.

391
00:28:13,573 --> 00:28:15,507
I have to open tonight.

392
00:28:15,575 --> 00:28:17,838
I'm sorry, Dr. Bryant. I have kitchen duty.

393
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:19,902
Well, can we continue this after work?

394
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:23,346
Sure, as long as, It's public. Yeah.

395
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:27,409
Bye.

396
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:32,587
You're not giving away any
trade secrets, are you?

397
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:37,186
- How long have you been there?
- Eh, long enough to know...

398
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:41,063
that you could still
construct an atomic bomb if you had to.

399
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:44,933
An atomic bomb? Al.

400
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:48,532
Nothing we discussed...

401
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:52,044
remotely is connected to nuclear detonation.

402
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:55,080
Al, I was just trying to,

403
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:02,548
- You're not alone.
- Nope.

404
00:29:02,622 --> 00:29:07,958
- But they can't hear or see me.
- Thank God for little favors.

405
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:12,895
- Weitzman and the
committee? - I-I can't help you, Sam.

406
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:14,900
You got to, Al. Look, I figured it out.

407
00:29:14,968 --> 00:29:18,267
Donna left me at the altar. Did the same thing
to the guy she was engaged to before me.

408
00:29:18,337 --> 00:29:22,240
It's a pattern. When she was 8, her father
left and she's never gotten over it.

409
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:24,673
Al, she blocked out her own father's name.

410
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:29,271
Don't you see? Donna's never gonna
risk being hurt by a man like that again.

411
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:33,182
She's gonna go through life
leaving them before they can leave her.

412
00:29:33,252 --> 00:29:38,623
But... But if I can get Donna
and her father together, who knows?

413
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:42,218
You know, uh, those six doctorates that you hold,

414
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:45,720
Not one of them is in psychiatry.

415
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:51,031
Medicine, yes. Uh, quantum physics, yes.

416
00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:53,731
Ancient languages, yes.

417
00:29:55,842 --> 00:29:59,141
- Ancient languages, yes.
- Yes.

418
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:04,811
The sash?

419
00:30:04,884 --> 00:30:07,284
Brilliant, Sherlock. Hieroglyphics?

420
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:09,445
I can read hieroglyphics?

421
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:12,752
Well, you never know unless you try.

422
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:16,258
It's all just a bunch of pictures to me, Al.

423
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,888
I can't remember what they... That...

424
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:22,365
That is a the symbol for a capital.

425
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:27,372
Um, what was the ancient capital of
Egypt? Memphis! He's in Memphis!

426
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,203
- No, I wouldn't say that, Sam. No.
- Not in Memphis.

427
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:34,609
Um, maybe the capital of Egypt today
- Don't tell me he's in Cairo.

428
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:36,548
You're being too literal, Sam.

429
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:39,565
Well, that hieroglyphic is
the symbol for a capital.

430
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:40,547
Mm.

431
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:43,010
Um,

432
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,288
Our capital? You're trying to
tell me he's in Washington.

433
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,796
Good. Okay. Donna's father is in D.C.,

434
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:54,663
and he, um, is still in the army.

435
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:56,667
That's the symbol for the pharaoh's army.

436
00:30:56,736 --> 00:31:01,901
Sam. Square times five.

437
00:31:01,974 --> 00:31:05,808
- And in the Pentagon!
- Oh, I'd give you one of these if I could.

438
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:08,711
I need his name, Al.

439
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,046
That's, uh... That's ridiculous.

440
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:16,884
Uh, Sam, Ziggy is scanning my
side of this conversation,

441
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:20,756
and he thinks I'm trying to
communicate to you in a code.

442
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:24,656
What hieroglyphics?

443
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:30,169
Hey! How can I write
Colonel Wojohowitz in hieroglyphics?

444
00:31:34,507 --> 00:31:36,701
Al!

445
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:40,471
Did you call me, Dr. Bryant?

446
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:44,947
If I asked you to go to Washington,
would you do it?

447
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:48,086
Dr. Bryant, I was just getting to like you.

448
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:50,417
Don't treat me like that. I'm
not treating you like that.

449
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,516
If I were 15 years younger or
this was 15 years later, I would,

450
00:31:53,593 --> 00:31:55,527
but I can't now.

451
00:31:55,595 --> 00:31:57,926
Donna, it's important.

452
00:31:57,997 --> 00:32:01,523
Hell, I'll bring a chaperone.

453
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:03,535
We can be there and back in a day.

454
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:05,901
To do what?

455
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:10,465
Save a lost love.

456
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:25,916
- Colonel Wojohowitz.
- Thank God.

457
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:29,119
What? Uh, Colonel, you
don't know me. My name is Bryant,

458
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:31,163
Dr, Gerald Bryant, and I'm on the faculty...

459
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,163
at Lawrence College in Marion, Ohio.

460
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:35,325
Yes? Uh, I was wondering if I could see you.

461
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:38,393
Dr. Bryant, I ship out
for Vietnam at 0800 tomorrow.

462
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:40,404
Vietnam.

463
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:43,931
I'm sure you've heard of it. Of course. I just...

464
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:46,273
Doctor, I'm very busy. Would
you get to the point?

465
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:49,781
It's your daughter.

466
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:58,884
Colonel, are you there?

467
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:01,615
Yes.

468
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:06,953
- Do you remember Donna?
- Of course I remember Donna.

469
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:09,000
She needs you, sir.

470
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:13,493
Is she hurt? No. Uh, not physically.

471
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:18,201
Colonel, since you're shipping out tomorrow,
I don't have time to be subtle about this.

472
00:33:18,277 --> 00:33:21,211
I don't know why you left your family.
I'm sure you had your reasons.

473
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,874
But your leaving and never
contacting her again...

474
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,042
has affected Donna's ability to love anyone else.

475
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:31,454
Dr. Bryant, the breakup with her
mother and I had nothing to do with her.

476
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:35,425
She doesn't think you love her, that if
you did, you wouldn't have abandoned her.

477
00:33:35,494 --> 00:33:37,655
I love my daughter. I loved her very much.

478
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:40,731
I'm not going to reopen this wound...

479
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,858
not when I'm shipping out.

480
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,414
Maybe when I come back.

481
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:49,498
Well, forgive me, sir, but, uh,
what if you don't come back?

482
00:33:51,044 --> 00:33:53,103
Good-bye, Dr. Bryant.

483
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:59,643
Just a damn minute!

484
00:34:01,788 --> 00:34:04,483
Look...

485
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,994
I told you I'd be back.

486
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:24,405
Okay. All right.

487
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:26,740
So...

488
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:28,746
my advice didn't work.

489
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:30,748
Right. Right. Right?

490
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:33,784
What happened? I did what you told me.

491
00:34:33,853 --> 00:34:35,980
I, uh, I read her poetry.

492
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:39,615
I told her that her perfume made me
horny and that her lips made me even hornier.

493
00:34:39,692 --> 00:34:41,284
I get the idea. And then,

494
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,851
I get the idea! Look, Oscar,

495
00:34:45,364 --> 00:34:47,331
"horny" isn't romantic.

496
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:49,992
Well, it is to me. Not to Jamie-Lee.

497
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:53,936
To Jamie-Lee,

498
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:56,474
"breathless with passion"...

499
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:59,340
is romantic.

500
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:01,378
Do you have a car?

501
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,211
O.

502
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:07,251
Triple deuce, Hurst
four-speed, 3-9-0 rear end, mag wheels.

503
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:10,719
Uh, will it hold four people?

504
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:12,882
Maybe. Say, me,

505
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:16,621
and Donna Eleese and you and Jamie-Lee?

506
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:18,559
In that order?

507
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,190
Yeah, in that order.

508
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:33,505
- Did you see him?
- Bang.

509
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:39,108
You'd shoot that magnificent creature?

510
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:42,621
It was a buck. Bambi was a buck!

511
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:45,884
I want to change seats, please.

512
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:49,291
Jamie-Lee, Romeo hunted deer.

513
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:52,793
He did? Yes, he did.

514
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:57,130
- And, uh, as well as...
- Lancelot.

515
00:35:57,202 --> 00:36:01,298
Lancelot. You know, I bet
Lancelot brought Guinevere a deer a week.

516
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,773
And Rochester rode on stag hunts.

517
00:36:04,842 --> 00:36:06,742
That's right.

518
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:10,907
The first time Blanche came to Thornwood
she rode to the hounds.

519
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:15,918
Is that how you hunt stag?

520
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:19,422
Mm, sort a.

521
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:27,420
And while Lennon read a book on Marx

522
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:30,934
The quartet practiced in the park

523
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:34,166
And we sang dirges in the dark

524
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,438
The day the music died Fill 'er up?

525
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,945
Yep. Okay.

526
00:36:42,014 --> 00:36:43,947
Where's the bathroom? Uh, back there.

527
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:46,951
Where's the key? Key? We don't have no key.

528
00:36:57,362 --> 00:37:01,389
Al! Thank God you're here. I thought
I'd never see you again.

529
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:03,400
I figured that they'd pulled you off the project.

530
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:07,735
Oh, they did. They fed the
hieroglyphics into Ziggy, and then they fired me.

531
00:37:07,806 --> 00:37:09,898
They can't do that. Tell Weitzman.

532
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:14,742
But it's unimportant. What's
important is he's had a change of heart.

533
00:37:14,813 --> 00:37:16,474
I didn't think Weitzman had a heart.

534
00:37:16,547 --> 00:37:18,481
He probably doesn't, but his wife does.

535
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,389
You slept with his wife?

536
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:24,146
I would never do
anything so unscrupulous as that,

537
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:26,748
unless it was Bartlett's wife.

538
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:29,760
Now, there is a woman to get fired over.

539
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:32,922
Ran into her one time at the fights.

540
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:36,262
Uh, Barlett was at some, I
don't know, some seminar in Utah.

541
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:39,269
And it was her birthday, and
you know, the fool forgot.

542
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:42,704
What happened? Oh, well,
we had a couple of drinks,

543
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:46,141
a nice rare steak with green chiles
- With Weitzman!

544
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,405
Oh! Weitzman.

545
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,414
You know Tina? Yeah.

546
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:52,313
Weitzman knows her too.

547
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:56,012
You set Tina up with
Weitzman and then blackmailed him?

548
00:37:57,356 --> 00:37:59,289
Yeah. That...

549
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,123
Unscrupulous, but effective.

550
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:08,463
At least you're here. That's
the way I figured it.

551
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:11,934
Now, I had Ziggy compute the odds...

552
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:16,668
on your being right about
fixing Donna's hang-up.

553
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:19,744
Pretty low, huh?

554
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:22,576
Well, if you get Donna and her father together,

555
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:27,744
the odds are 4-to-1 that she'll commit
to a relationship in the future.

556
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:32,882
Al, no offense, but this time I'm
gonna make Ziggy my best man.

557
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:35,755
Wait a minute. You're forgetting something.

558
00:38:35,827 --> 00:38:40,322
What? Well, she was engaged to
someone before she even met you.

559
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:43,492
Yeah? Yeah, so if you pull this off,

560
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:45,730
she could marry this other jerk first.

561
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:03,554
Confession time.

562
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:06,021
What?

563
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:10,391
I used to think you wrote your
book just to pick up young, naive coeds.

564
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:14,498
You really are romantic, aren't you?

565
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:15,427
Well...

566
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:19,027
I mean, you're trying to
get these two back together,

567
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:22,369
driving 400 miles for the sake of a lost love.

568
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:28,909
What I don't understand is
why you wanted me here.

569
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:33,577
You remind me of her. Twelve
years younger, but...

570
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:36,485
you're her.

571
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:41,425
Sweet, bright. She's a quantum physicist.

572
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:43,791
That's why you read those books.

573
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:48,094
We were very much in love, engaged to be married.

574
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:52,297
In fact, we had a wedding, or, rather, I did.

575
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:54,099
She didn't show?

576
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:01,338
Why?

577
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:04,405
I think she was afraid to commit.

578
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:07,451
Afraid...

579
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:09,748
that I'd leave her...

580
00:40:09,822 --> 00:40:12,016
the way her father left her.

581
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:16,255
I don't wanna see you run away
when your chance for happiness comes.

582
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:19,855
That's why I'm taking you to see your father.

583
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:23,193
You're taking me to see my father?

584
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:25,860
Yes.

585
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:38,710
You really are romantic.

586
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:43,414
<i>To show I love you</i>

587
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:46,286
<i>Thinking of you</i>

588
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:51,385
<i>Write your name across the sky...</i>

589
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:05,440
May I help you?

590
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,603
Yeah. We're just going up
to see Colonel Wojohowitz.

591
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,612
Can I have your names, please?

592
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:13,777
Yeah. I'm Dr. Gerald Bryant and
this is the Colonel's daughter, Donna.

593
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:16,945
Oh. Colonel Wojohowitz. Oh, thanks.

594
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:18,956
Uh, sir, excuse me.

595
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:21,184
The Colonel has a "Do not disturb" on his line.

596
00:41:22,494 --> 00:41:24,427
Well, this is his daughter.

597
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:26,896
Could we see some
identification, Miss Wojohowitz?

598
00:41:26,965 --> 00:41:29,592
Oh, I use my mother's maiden name.

599
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:34,436
I'm sorry, but unless you can prove you're
his daughter, I can't ring through.

600
00:41:35,641 --> 00:41:37,574
You're welcome to wait here
and catch him when he leaves.

601
00:41:37,643 --> 00:41:41,135
Well, that'll be a little late. He's
shipping out to Vietnam this morning.

602
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:45,809
Look, she's driven all
night from Ohio to see her father.

603
00:41:45,884 --> 00:41:47,818
Couldn't you just please...

604
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:50,251
call him on the phone and tell
him that his daughter's here?

605
00:41:50,322 --> 00:41:52,949
I'm sorry, sir. I can't do that.

606
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:55,492
Thank you. You've been most helpful.

607
00:42:12,945 --> 00:42:15,003
Guess it wasn't meant to be.

608
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:19,172
You sound like Ziggy. Who?

609
00:42:25,724 --> 00:42:27,851
Something about that guy bothers me.

610
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:37,463
There's a car in visitor's
lot. I didn't see it there earlier.

611
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:51,014
Harry, this car has Ohio plates.

612
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:52,947
Check the back. I'll put Jeff on alert.

613
00:42:53,018 --> 00:42:54,952
Roger.

614
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:58,318
Oh, no. We're gonna get in trouble.

615
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:02,018
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

616
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:16,731
So it wasn't meant to be?

617
00:43:48,373 --> 00:43:51,034
This was a mistake.

618
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:57,342
No. The mistake was waiting 10 years.

619
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:06,418
I'm sorry, baby. I love you.

620
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,425
Ohhh.

621
00:44:08,492 --> 00:44:11,586
That's all I wanted to hear, Daddy.

622
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,605
Don't leave.

623
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:26,110
I'll be in the car.

624
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:31,547
Uh, if only you were a little...

625
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,606
Little younger?

626
00:44:33,684 --> 00:44:37,882
Uh, or I was a little older.

627
00:44:41,525 --> 00:44:43,516
You will be.

628
00:44:56,108 --> 00:44:58,076
Where's Jerry?

629
00:44:59,376 --> 00:45:01,344
You don't need Dr. Bryant.

630
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:05,173
Not with me here.

631
00:45:06,985 --> 00:45:09,715
Well,

632
00:45:09,788 --> 00:45:12,153
you are big.

633
00:45:22,634 --> 00:45:25,262
Harry, we got an open door.

634
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:32,105
Police, this is the
Watergate. We have a break-in here.

635
00:45:32,177 --> 00:45:34,610
Jamie-Lee,

636
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:36,670
you make me so hor...

637
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:40,509
breathless with passion.

638
00:45:51,695 --> 00:45:54,289
You seem pretty pleased with yourself.

639
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:57,860
Yeah.

640
00:45:57,936 --> 00:46:00,335
Mm. Well, so am I.

641
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:04,170
'Course, Ziggy's blowing out microchips
like they were popcorn.

642
00:46:04,242 --> 00:46:06,106
He just... He didn't see it coming.

643
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:07,644
What? What?

644
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:11,807
Sam, this is the 17 th of June, 1972.

645
00:46:11,882 --> 00:46:15,215
So? So?

646
00:46:15,286 --> 00:46:17,447
We're in the Watergate!

647
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:22,414
Break-in. Nixon. Impeachment.

648
00:46:24,128 --> 00:46:26,063
I don't remember.

649
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,190
Oh, boy. The Republicans would love you.

650
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:37,934
You know, I don't understand you, pal.

651
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:41,273
Well, you're wearing that goofball grin...

652
00:46:41,346 --> 00:46:45,612
and Donna is probably gonna end up
marrying that sucker that she hooked before you.

653
00:46:45,684 --> 00:46:49,949
Maybe not. Maybe she'll jilt him and marry me.

654
00:46:50,021 --> 00:46:53,422
Wanna bet? Yeah. I got connections.

655
00:46:55,025 --> 00:46:58,757
Then how come you haven't leaped yet?

656
00:47:12,777 --> 00:47:14,802
Maybe I need a shotgun...

657
00:47:25,824 --> 00:47:28,952
Get up.! Get up.! One, two, three...

658
00:47:29,027 --> 00:47:31,358
Up! Up! Come on! four,

659
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:33,693
five, six.
