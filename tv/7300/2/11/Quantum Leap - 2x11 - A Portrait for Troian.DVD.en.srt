Julian was in the rowboat

He was usually good
for a half an hour,

he was bored.

send the painting?

in flagrante.

Al, I don't care
how many Claridges are in the lake.

None of them

Yeah, right.
That was made by a ghost.

271

to record a voice...

Yeah, and some people,

00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:42,527
Be tricky. Would take
an electronic genius.
Yeah, I know.

You tell Ziggy if he doesn't
