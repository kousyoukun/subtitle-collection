30
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,650
這位是我的新學員  蒂姆·阿姆斯特朗
Meet my new trainee, Tim Armstrong.

31
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,450
各位好
Hello.

32
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,640
稍微帶有一點不完美的完美
There's nothing more stunning than

33
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,440
是最動人的
seeing perfection with a slight imperfection.

34
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,250
你是個律師
You're a lawyer.

35
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,280
是的
Yes.

36
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,310
這是我的名片
It's my card.

37
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,870
海伍德·賈赫普彌
"Heywood Jahelpme."

38
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,630
這中間名好獨特
That's a unique middle name.

39
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,890
其實  是
Um, actually it's pronounced

40
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,980
賈...赫普彌  就是
"Ja-help-me," As in,

41
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,940
"你好  能幫幫我嗎"
"Hey, would ya help me?"

42
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,010
好吧
Okay, oh, yeah.

43
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,670
真對不起
I'm sorry.

44
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,020
不怎么擅長第一次約會
Not good at first dates.

45
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,480
那次約會并不是我最糟糕的一次
It was not the worst date that I've ever had.

46
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,010
好了
All right, hey, um...

47
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,640
-你想過來嗎  -好  抱歉
- do you want to come through? - Okay, sorry.

48
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,000
-借過  -來  抱歉
- Excuse me. - Here, yeah, sorry.

49
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,290
這個地方很不錯
Here's a good vantage point.

50
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,730
好激動啊
Oh, so excited.

51
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,010
我參加過電影首映  沒看過花首開
Went to a movie opening once, never a flower opening.

52
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,370
不是普通的花  是泰坦魔芋
Oh, not just any flower, the titan arum.

53
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,320
我都沒聽說過這種植物
Never even heard of this plant.

54
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,930
這幾周來跟你在一起
It's one of a million incredible things

55
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,950
我學到了好多不可思議的東西
that I have learned these past weeks

56
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,300
今天又學到一樣
just from spending time with you.

57
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,900
我真的很開心  沃特
I'm really happy, Walter.

58
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,770
我也是
I am as well.

59
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,860
植物園的資助者們
Botanical Gardens patrons,

60
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,020
十年里  泰坦魔芋將在幾分鐘后
the titan arum will be blooming for the first time

61
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,820
首次開花
in a decade in just a moment.

62
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,640
禁止拍照
Photography is prohibited.

63
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,590
要嗎
You want one?

64
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,070
不  謝謝  我還一肚子晚飯吃的烤魚呢
No, thank you, I'm full of fermented fish from dinner.

65
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,580
我也是
Oh, huh, me too.

66
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,330
我真的喜歡上這個了
I'm really getting a taste for it.

67
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,380
印度尼西亞人管它叫尸臭花
Do you know the Indonesians call it bunga bangkai?

68
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,710
就是花加上尸體
So, bunga means flower and bangkai means cadaver.

69
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,560
為什么叫這個
Why do they name it that?

70
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,650
因為開花時它會散發尸臭味兒
Well, 'cause that's what it smells like when it opens.

71
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,900
開花了
Oh, it's blooming.

72
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,450
天吶
Oh, God...

73
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,080
是啊  是不是很神奇
I know, isn't it truly amazing?

74
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,200
琳達
Linda?

75
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,320
{\an8}洛杉磯縣法院

76
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,350
你帶她去看尸臭花
You took her to see the corpse flower?

77
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,140
她很喜歡的
She loved it...

78
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,310
她還喜歡碳定年系列講座
like she loved the carbon dating lecture series,

79
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,070
格里菲斯天文臺展覽
the Griffith Observatory exhibit...

80
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,070
還有科技中心的
Oh! And the Combustion Motors Pavilion

81
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,990
內燃機館
at the Science Center.

82
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,880
那不是約會  是科學考察
Those aren't dates; those are field trips.

83
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,870
聽著  伙計
Look, pal,

84
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,350
我早就覺得懷疑了
I've been suspicious of something for a while now,

85
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,900
而你的約會證實了我的擔心
and your date confirms my fear.

86
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,500
琳達根本不喜歡你
Linda ain't into you.

87
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,610
你錯了
Wrong.

88
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,570
她很喜歡我的智商
She's very much EQ for my IQ,

89
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,590
懂我意思吧
if you know what I'm saying.

90
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,360
我懂  惡心
I do, and gross...

91
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,850
但事實上  她是有少女綜合征
but the fact is she suffers from Damsel Syndrome.

92
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,450
因為你冒生命危險救了她
'Cause you risked your life to save her,

93
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,790
所以她跟你在一起時
so when she's with you

94
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,440
她又再次體驗了
she experiences the same

95
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,740
那次緊張經歷時
dopamine and endorphin release

96
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,180
釋放多巴胺和腦內啡的情景
she had during that intense experience.

97
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,140
她是迷戀那種身體反應
S-s-she's hooked on that physiological reaction.

98
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,140
而這最終會消退
It's one that will eventually fade.

99
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,080
她是第一個跟我喜好相同的
Well, she's the first non-genius woman 

100
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
非天才女性
who actually likes the things that I like; 

101
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,950
她喜歡跟我在一起
she enjoys being with me...

102
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,630
她是喜歡她腦子里的化學反應
She-she enjoys the chemical reaction in her brain.

103
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,680
我也并不想告訴你這個  伙計
I-I-I take no pleasure in telling you this, pal.

104
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,210
聽著  佩吉最近經常跟蒂姆在一起
Look... Paige has been spending some time with Tim lately.

105
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,500
你的潛意識看到了這個
Your subconscious sees this 

106
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,610
就想給自己也找個伴
and wants you to find your own companion.

107
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,250
讓你看不清真相
It's blinding you to the truth.

108
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,150
好啊  你們來了
Good, you guys are here.

109
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,650
凱布不喜歡別人用他的旅行杯
Oh, Cabe doesn't like it when people use his travel mugs.

110
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,250
不  是蒂姆給我的
Oh, no, Tim-Tim gave it to me.

111
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,010
我們進去吧
Okay, should we go in?

112
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,760
你沒事吧  你似乎不舒服
Are you okay? You look sick.

113
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,540
不  我就是
What, no, I'm just...

114
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,930
擔心拉爾夫
uh, anxious about Ralph.

115
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,010
好
Oh, okay.

116
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,200
我堅持讓拉爾夫在我課上用我的電腦
I insisted Ralph work only on my laptop in class 

117
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,380
是因為我不確信
because I doubted that

118
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,150
一個孩子能獨立完成所有課業
a child could do all the work on his own without any help.

119
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,250
我是想近距離觀察他
I wanted to observe him closely.

120
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,410
我的擔心是有依據的
My concerns were founded.

121
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,790
他的作業沒能及格
He failed the assignment.

122
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,600
我要打昏他
I'm gonna knock this guy out.

123
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,010
所以你讓他用了你的電腦
So, you had him use your computer,

124
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,030
所以就沒法證明
so there's no real way to prove

125
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,070
是拉爾夫編寫了我們所說的程序
that Ralph created the code in question?!

126
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,330
是啊  我就這意思
Yes, that's my point.

127
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,730
不不不  等等
No, no, no, wait, uh...

128
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,800
我是說
I meant...

129
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,100
他
his, um...

130
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,350
他...法官大人  我能重說嗎
he's turning... Your Honor, can I start over?

131
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,570
希望他有所準備
I hope he's working on contingency.

132
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,350
莫里斯先生  你還有什么問題嗎
Mr. Morris, do you have any more questions at this time?

133
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,630
我不確定
I'm not sure.

134
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,860
這跟我預想的不一樣
This is not going how I'd hoped.

135
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,520
請求提問  法官大人
Request for re-direct, Your Honor?

136
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,600
說吧
Go ahead.

137
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,450
這比電視上演得難多了
This is harder than it is on TV.

138
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,640
教授  能告訴我們這是什么嗎
Professor, can you tell us what these are?

139
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,860
編程就像寫小說
Coding's like writing a novel.

140
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,080
我不想因為電腦故障而丟章節
Don't want to lose chapters to a computer glitch,

141
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,760
所以我有做備份
so I back up my work.

142
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,760
打印文檔證明我已經編寫這些程序六個月之久
The printout proves I've been scripting that code for six months.

143
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,670
我不是最近才偷的
I didn't just recently steal it.

144
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,240
拉爾夫的程序只是很基本的項目
Ralph's code was just a rudimentary project.

145
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
他搞砸了
He just messed up.

146
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,440
如果我能拿到記錄  我就能打敗他
If I can get those records, I can beat this guy.

147
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,480
我看夠了  我打算判決了
I've seen enough. I'm ready to rule.

148
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,810
你得阻止他  海伍德
You have to stop him, Heywood.

149
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,750
但他都拿起錘子了
But he's picking up the hammer.

150
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,630
想想辦法
Think of something.

151
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,590
法官大人  我們并未看到過這些備份文件
Your Honor, uh, we've not seen the back up documents ever.

152
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,850
因為你自己沒申請
That's because you never requested them.

153
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,210
你只要了程序的副本
You only asked for a copy of the code,

154
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,630
而沒要編程的過程文件
not the work product that went into making the code.

155
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,500
是啊  那是因為我忘了
Yes... but that's because I forgot.

156
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,640
法官大人
Your Honor,

157
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,490
你現在不能判決
you can't rule at this moment because, uh...

158
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,170
我的委托人有嚴重精神問題
My client has major mental issues.

159
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,480
說誰呢
Talk about projection.

160
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,180
有話快說  莫里斯先生
Make your point, Mr. Morris.

161
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,570
宣誓書中已經表明  我的委托人是名天才
As stated in the affidavits, my client is a genius,

162
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,300
高智商可能是有害的
and high intelligence can be a detriment,

163
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,630
您允許一名有特殊障礙的少年
and you allowed a minor with unique challenges

164
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,150
在進行能力聽證之前就打算做出裁決
to testify before we could give him a competency hearing.

165
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,330
你要質疑你自己委托人的能力
You're challenging the competency of your own client?

166
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,070
你是在拖時間
You're just trying to buy time.

167
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,560
法官大人  如果你現在裁決
Your Honor, if you rule now,

168
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,490
那么我們可以提出上訴
you leave your decision open for appeal...

169
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,740
或者  你可以讓我給他做測評
or, you could let me have him evaluated.

170
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,200
好吧  給你到下午2點
Fine, you have until 2:00 p.m.

171
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,780
好嘞
All right.

172
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,210
拿下一樁動議
Won a motion.

173
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,260
再跟我說一遍你們要
Tell me again what you're looking for

174
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,650
在這一堆文件里找什么
in these boxes of paperwork.

175
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,860
有時候我在我的程序里留下數字線索
Sometimes I'd leave numerical clues in my code

176
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,850
好標記我需要回頭進行修改的地方
to remember where I had to go back to clean things up.

177
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,100
叫做書簽
It's called bookmarking.

178
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,010
叫做"我聽不懂"
It's called, "I'm lost."

179
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,520
我去翻翻案卷
I'm gonna go read case files, 

180
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,520
看看能不能找到有用的東西
see if I can find anything to help us.

181
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,790
有人知道鎮子上有法律圖書館嗎
Anybody know if there's a law library in town?

182
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,500
我自己去找吧
I'll find it.

183
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,400
我也搞不懂了
Yeah, uh, I'm lost, too.

184
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,800
書簽怎么會有用
How does bookmarking help?

185
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,010
我用了一些我很容易察覺的數字  比如我生日
I used numbers easy for me to spot, like my birthday.

186
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,120
如果我能找到  就能證明是我做的
So if I find them, I can prove I did the work.

187
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,910
你是個天才
You're a genius; 

188
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,500
你不記得把它們放在哪了嗎
don't you remember where you left them?

189
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,490
有兩千五百萬行代碼
There's 25 million lines of code.

190
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,520
如果想的話我本來是可以記住地點的
Could've memorized the locations if I wanted to,

191
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,350
但當時我覺得沒什么必要
but I didn't think it was relevant at the time.

192
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,550
好吧  我去找其他人來
Okay, I'm gonna grab the others 

193
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
我們一起找找你到底把聲波曲線
and we'll start searching where you scripted the sine curves 

194
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,720
寫在哪了
of the sound waves.

195
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,730
不  我用的是逆傳播表面聲波
No, I used counter-propagating surface acoustic waves;

196
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,780
將它們穿透壓電襯底發射
sent them across the piezoelectric substrate.

197
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,000
等等  那要怎么起作用
Wait, how-how does that work?

198
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,380
這樣我就能通過改變音調控制數據流變化
So, I can change data flow by changing sound pitch.

199
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,790
我不確定那會有用
I'm not sure how that would play out.

200
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,970
就是個簡單的數據傳輸
It's simple data transfer.

201
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,420
好吧  是在波峰還是波谷
Right, on-on the crest or the trough of the wave?

202
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,450
你是對的
You're right.

203
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,920
你應該集中在正弦曲線上
You should work on the sine curves.

204
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,680
拉爾夫  我不需要你來教我關注哪個  好嗎
Ralph, I don't need you to tell me what to work on. Okay?

205
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,120
我們先解決聲波的事
We'll focus on the acoustic waves.

206
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,760
沒多少時間了  先做了再說
Now we don't have much time, so let's just get to it.

207
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,460
你到底怎么回事
What the hell is wrong with you?

208
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,010
你吼了他
You snapped at him.

209
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,670
我沒吼
I didn't snap. 

210
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,460
不  他解釋過頭了  而我們時間很緊迫
No, he was overexplaining and we're on a clock.

211
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,720
他在幫你解決
He was helping you with something 

212
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,170
你根本不了解的事  你卻吼了他
that you clearly didn't understand, and you barked at him.

213
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,670
我沒有  他甚至沒有
I did not. He doesn't even...

214
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,830
有情感
Feel things?

215
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,900
有  他有的  沃特
Yes, he does, Walter.

216
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,670
他和你很像  但不完全一樣
He is like you, but not exactly like you.

217
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,370
你該向他道歉
You owe him an apology, 

218
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,700
如果你再用那種態度跟他說話的話
and the next time you talk to him like that,

219
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,800
我就不干了
I am out of here.

220
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,650
沃特
Hey, Walt.

221
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,430
誰惹你了
Who peed in your punch?

222
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,370
什么
What?

223
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,010
沒人惹我
Nobody.

224
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,550
那把大家召集起來
Then gather up the gang.

225
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,170
蒂姆正帶著國防部的庫克探員
Tim's coming in with Agent Cook 

226
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,410
往這邊來
from the Department of Defense.

227
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,230
他有最高權限  這些家伙可不喜歡浪費時間
He has top clearance and these guys don't mess around.

228
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,730
諾克斯堡是一處美軍基地
Fort Knox is a U.S. Army base.

229
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,310
{\an8}檔案影像資料

230
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,800
這里著名的金庫
The famous gold depository located there

231
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,020
由財政部一手控制
is controlled completely by the Treasury.

232
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,240
他們不僅有權控制
They also have authority over

233
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,400
全國的黃金供應情況
not only our nation's gold supply,

234
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,150
還掌握著歷史文物  比如《人權法案》
but artifacts from our history such as the Bill of Rights 

235
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,480
以及《獨立宣言》
and Declaration of Independence.

236
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,100
這些文件在華盛頓國家檔案博物館展出
Those are displayed in the National Archive Museum in D.C.

237
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,840
看起來像這些文件的仿品都在特區展出
Documents that look like them are displayed in D.C.

238
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,280
真品都需要被保護起來
The real McCoys need to be protected.

239
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,560
一些政府為了安全起見
Knox also houses historic valuables

240
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,600
也把他們珍貴的歷史文物存在諾克斯
belonging to foreign governments for safekeeping

241
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,920
因為毫無疑問
because the facility is, without question,

242
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,510
那里是地球上最安全的地方
the most secure on earth.

243
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,650
我感覺你接下來要說個很厲害的"但是"
I'm sensing a big "But" Coming.

244
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,760
很厲害的"蛋"
Big butt.

245
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,950
最近
Well, recently,

246
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,870
財政部雇用了斯蒂爾森保全公司
the Treasury privatized Depository security

247
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,220
將金庫的保全系統私有化了
by hiring Steelson Security,

248
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,390
這個公司有點像黑水公司
it's a Blackwater-like firm.

249
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,390
{\an8}美國著名雇傭兵和安全顧問公司

250
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,470
國防部覺得這威脅到了
The DOD feels this compromises

251
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,560
國家寶藏和金儲備
our nation's treasures and reserves.

252
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,300
我們覺得應該我們保護金庫
We feel we should protect the Depository

253
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,510
也想證明給總統看
and we want to prove it to the president.

254
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,640
好吧  給我們提供基地航拍照片
Okay... provide aerial photos of the base,

255
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,660
私人保全公司的運輸流程細目表
breakdown of the private security company's operational logistic,

256
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,400
我們會分析...
we'll analyze...

257
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,060
不  理論分析太薄弱了
No, I can't use theories.

258
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,950
我需要證據
I need proof...

259
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,930
唯一能證明諾克斯堡并不安全的辦法
and the only way to prove Fort Knox isn't secure...

260
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,410
就是闖進去
is to break in.

261
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,960
說什么瘋話呢
Crazy-man-says-what-now?

262
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,810
除非有真憑實據證明有安全隱患
The White House doesn't want to order a security change 

263
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,220
白宮是不會想更換保安系統的
without hard evidence of vulnerability.

264
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,070
如果他們換了
Because if they do,

265
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,580
之后諾克斯又出了問題
and Knox is cracked at a later date,

266
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,740
他們會被唾罵攻擊的
the administration has egg on its face.

267
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,810
沒錯
Exactly.

268
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,860
證明能攻破的證據
Proof of successful breach

269
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,290
是要讓有三百年歷史的普魯士權杖消失
will be the removal of a 300-year-old Prussian scepter

270
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,630
因為德國和波蘭之間存在所有權爭議
held by the U.S. due to an ownership dispute

271
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,220
這支權杖現由美國保管
between Germany and Poland.

272
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,180
世界上獨一無二的權杖
One of a kind,

273
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,800
布滿了完美的寶石  無法造假
covered in flawless diamonds, and can't be forged.

274
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,110
你們把它偷出來
You retrieve it, 

275
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,900
然后我們就知道該更改寶藏的安保系統了
we know we have to change the way our assets are protected.

276
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,430
但沒人可以知道我們要這么干
But no one can know that we're coming in

277
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,170
要不這次行動就有先天缺陷了
or the endeavor is inherently flawed.

278
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,830
也就是意味著真正的保安
Which means real guards...

279
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,710
拿著真槍
With real guns...

280
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,740
會想盡辦法阻止我們
Will try to stop us.

281
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,530
沒錯
Yes...

282
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,550
而且這項工作是絕對不會記錄在案的
and the job is completely off the books,

283
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,330
說如果你們被抓到了  國防部和白宮
which means if you're caught, the DOD and the White House

284
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,370
不會承認對這次行動知情
will deny any knowledge of this mission...

285
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,270
即使你們通過了保安
and even if you get past the guards,

286
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,160
一直到達了地下保險庫
all the way to the subterranean vault,

287
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,200
按照設計  一旦有入侵跡象
it's rigged to expel knockout gas

288
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,330
就會釋放窒息性毒氣
at the first sign of tampering,

289
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,970
而且沒人知道保險庫里面還有什么機關
and who knows what traps lay beyond that door.

290
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,750
是啊  我看過類似的電影
Yeah, I've seen this movie before.

291
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,280
史泰龍  測試看看那監獄夠不夠安全
Hey, Stallone, go see if that prison is secure.

292
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,670
{\an8}指的是史泰龍2013主演的電影《金蟬脫殼》

293
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,640
什么  你被困在里面了
What? You're trapped now?

294
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,670
真不巧
That's a bummer.

295
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,470
抱歉  老兄  不記錄在案我們也不會考慮
Sorry, pal, off the books is off the table.

296
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,810
好吧  但是不記錄也就是不會入賬
All right but off the books means off the ledger,

297
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,820
意味著不用交稅
as in tax-free.

298
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,260
沒錯
All right.

299
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,410
一百萬美元現金
$1 million cash.

300
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,120
總統和國家感謝你們的付出
Compliments of your president and a grateful nation.

301
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,660
我能聞聞嗎
Do you mind if I smell that?

302
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,500
老實說  很誘人
You know what, i-it is very tempting,

303
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,490
但變數太多
but there are too many variables...

304
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,780
而我們不是小白鼠
and we're not lab rats.

305
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,510
把我們關進籠子里看看陷阱能不能起作用
Put us in a cage and see if the trap springs?

306
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,660
還是算了吧
No, thank you.

307
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,080
沒錯  沃特說得對
Yeah, Walter's right.

308
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,630
這幫人不玩碟中諜
These guys, they don't do Mission: Impossible.

309
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,380
光是保險庫里的機械障礙
I mean, the mechanical obstacles they would face

310
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,660
就夠他們受的了
in the vault alone are too daunting.

311
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,180
放松點  舞會國王
Easy... Prom King.

312
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,480
我能破解所有的保險箱
I can figure out any safe.

313
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,120
我很懷疑
Doubtful.

314
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,960
再說了  我們說的是嚴格訓練過的私人雇傭兵
Plus, we're talking about highly-trained private mercenaries.

315
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,410
可不是光靠計謀就能打敗的
They don't just get outsmarted.

316
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,870
我還沒到過看不透或者比我更聰明的人
I have yet to meet a person that I can't read or outsmart.

317
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,580
你襯衫上沾到咖啡漬了  看到了嗎
You got a little coffee stain on your shirt. Oh, see?

318
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,970
智取成功
Outsmarted.

319
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,720
好吧  但諾克斯堡采用了最先進的軟件
Okay, but Fort Knox is run by state-of-the-art software 

320
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,240
-破解不了  -多謝
- that can't be cracked. - Thank you.

321
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,260
很高興你提出自己的看法  蒂姆  但
Appreciate the insight, Tim, but, uh...

322
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,020
我們能突破外部建筑
we can handle the physical structure,

323
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,530
解決保安  破解軟件
the guards, the software

324
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,350
搞定所有難關
and anything else that's thrown at us...

325
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,510
但是
oh, but...

326
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,920
拉爾夫需要我們的幫助
Ralph needs our help.

327
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,260
我來幫他  我提供能車庫里的一切幫助
I can help him, and I can provide support from the garage.

328
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,310
我會和拉爾夫參加聽證會  這行得通
I'll be with Ralph for the hearing. This could work.

329
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,610
你同意嗎
You okay with this?

330
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,370
我不喜歡因為困難就放棄
I don't like backing down on something just 'cause it's difficult.

331
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,720
我不喜歡放棄一百萬美元
I don't like backing down from a million dollars. 

332
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,990
好好想想  沃特
Think about this, Walt.

333
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,420
我以為我才是刺激他們自尊心的人
I thought I was the one who manipulated their egos.

334
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,500
整個諾克斯都事關國家利益
Knox is an integral national interest,

335
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,550
國安部需要天蝎來接手這個案子
and Homeland needs Scorpion to take this case...

336
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,050
看你的表現
...and I may have picked up a few things

337
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,140
我差不多也學會了一點怎么對付這群人
on how to handle these guys from watching you.

338
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,570
名師出高徒  對吧
Learn from the best, right?

339
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,280
行  侵入諾克斯堡吧
All right, let's break into Fort Knox.

340
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,500
我想說我們可以侵入安全系統
I'd say we could hack the security,

341
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,520
但我覺得諾克斯是沒有接入過網的
but I assume Knox is air-gapped.

342
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,350
沒錯
Yes.

343
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,790
整個系統都是離線的
System's completely off-line.

344
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,620
太棒了  所以這意味著沒有信息
Great, so that means there's no information

345
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,240
進入或者流出金庫
transmitted into or out of the Depository.

346
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,590
但你知道是用什么進出基地的嗎  水
But you know what is transferred in and off the base: water.

347
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,810
那里有很多水管以便水進進出出
There are pipes bringing water in and out.

348
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,900
標準水暖管道大小不足以
Standard plumbing pipes aren't big enough

349
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,140
讓人通過
for humans to fit through.

350
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,850
那還用說嗎  但是它們太小了  容易堵塞
No duh, but they are small enough to easily clog.

351
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,100
我可以用追蹤器改裝玩具潛艇
I can modify a toy submarine with a GPS tracker.

352
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,610
把它放入城市排水系統
Drop it into the municipal system.

353
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,960
希爾在車庫里控制它
Sly controls it from the garage.

354
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,910
諾克斯的藍圖是最高機密
Knox's blueprints are top secret,

355
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,370
但是城市用水圖很容易入侵
but the municipal water schematics are easily hacked.

356
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,320
我可以把潛艇引到金庫下面
I can guide the sub underneath the Depository.

357
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,410
玩具還沒有大到可以形成堵塞
Toy's not big enough to cause a clog.

358
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,690
這就要它運載正確的貨物才行
It is if it's carrying the right cargo.

359
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,390
樂樂  你覺得怎么樣
Happy, what're you thinking?

360
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,650
聚氨酯泡沫塑料
Polyurethane foam.

361
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,930
希爾彈開艙門
Sly pops open the hatch,

362
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,140
當聚氨酯和水起反應時
when polyurethane reacts with water it expands,

363
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,950
地上就會有大量的水溢出
causing a heck of a spill upstairs.

364
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,390
他們就會像基地維修部報告
They'll report the problem to Base Maintenance.

365
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,280
我們侵入他們的電話系統就能接收所有電話
We hack their phone system so all calls come to us.

366
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,290
維修部
Maintenance.

367
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,870
當然  我會馬上派水管工人過去
Sure thing, I'll send a plumbing crew up to you right away.

368
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,790
好  那他們就充當水管工吧
Okay, so they pretend to be plumbers

369
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,880
但是他們怎樣到達基地
but how do they get on the base?

370
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,540
我和蒂姆會解決這個問題
Tim and I can help out with that.

371
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,700
我們通過國土安全部
We set up a meeting 

372
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,420
安排了和基地指揮官的會面
with the base commander through Homeland

373
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,710
假借討論像諾克斯那樣的國家機構
under the guise of discussing theoretical threats

374
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,330
理論上所面臨的威脅
against national institutions like Knox.

375
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,860
我們是來見方特諾特上校的
We're here to see Colonel Fontenot.

376
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,170
找到時機我們就會離開車尾箱
We exit the trunk in character.

377
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,580
水管工軍隊準備好來幫忙
Army plumbers ready to lend a hand.

378
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,320
謝謝你們這么快趕到
Thanks for getting here so fast.

379
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,460
那里真是一團糟
It's a real mess in there.

380
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,230
別擔心
No worries.

381
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,400
我們處理過很多混亂的局面
We deal with a lot of messy situations.

382
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,310
一旦在金庫拿到了權杖
Once in the Depository, you get the scepter 

383
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,780
就到基地樹林里的會合點和我見面
and meet me at a rendezvous point in the woods on the base.

384
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,200
國防部管理著軍事基地
DOD runs Army bases

385
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,100
所以我可以理所當然地進去
so I can get on the grounds as a matter of course.

386
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,820
但是他們怎么進去保險庫里
But how do they get into the vault?

387
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,380
簡單  我們用他們的安保系統對付他們
Simple, we use their own security system against them.

388
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,830
要知道  我不是在教你怎樣做你的工作
You know, I'm not telling you how to do your job

389
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,490
但那些看起來不像水管
but those don't look like water pipes.

390
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,590
他們看起來像導管
They look like conduit.

391
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,020
要是你看一下栓口你會看水的凝結
If you look at the spigot hole there's condensation.

392
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,670
看到了嗎
Hmm, look at that?

393
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,760
這地方可能有窒息性毒氣
Maybe they do have knockout gas in this place.

394
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,260
樂樂  打開它
Happy, hit it.

395
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,440
然后我把本該通往保險庫門口的毒氣改一下路徑
Then I re-route the gas that was meant for the vault door 

396
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,720
通過排氣系統散播開來
so it disperses through the vent system.

397
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,190
窒息性毒氣讓我們有30分鐘時間
Knockout gas gives us 30 minutes

398
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,710
進入保險庫  打開它
to get into the vault, crack it,

399
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,330
拿到權杖迅速離開
grab the scepter and exit.

400
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,450
我和蒂姆完成與上校的談話后
Tim and I finish up our chat with the Colonel,

401
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,910
在車旁等你們
wait for you by the car.

402
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,860
我們已經占用你足夠多的時間了  上校
Well, we've taken up enough of your time, Colonel.

403
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,300
要知道國安部會竭盡所能幫助你們
Just know that Homeland's here to help you any way we can.

404
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,820
我們已經覆蓋了整個基地
Well, I've got the base covered,

405
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,250
自從斯蒂爾森接管以后
don't know much about the Depository

406
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,030
對金庫還不是很了解
since Steelson took over.

407
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,580
唯一的變化是他在保險庫入口加了一名
Only change is they put a fully armed and equipped guard

408
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,730
全副武裝的守衛
down at the vault entrance

409
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,070
而不是只讓守衛在通往保險庫的電梯里守著
instead of just at the elevators leading to it.

410
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,200
真的嗎
You don't say.

411
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,910
沃特  你收到了嗎
Walter, did you copy that?

412
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,170
地下室保險庫不只有毒氣守護
There's more than gas guarding the basement vault.

413
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,010
還有個守衛  沃特
There's a guard, Walter!

414
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,710
是的  我們發現了
Yes, we are aware.

415
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,590
糟了
Not good.

416
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,030
你們全部趴在墻上
All of you, up against the wall!

417
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,180
你會相信我們只是
Would you believe that we're the plumbers

418
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,640
來修水管的水管工嗎
who've come to fix the sink?

419
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,880
看來是不相信
I guess not.

420
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
我想他剛剛打了托比
I think he just hit Toby.

421
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,030
別跟他耍花腔
Don't wise-mouth the guy.

422
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,350
按他說的做
Do what he says.

423
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,200
現在趴在墻上
Against the wall now!

424
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,370
好  好
Okay, okay.

425
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,310
我是派克  那邊有人醒來了嗎
This is Pike. Anyone awake up there?

426
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,440
有人收到嗎  重復  收到了嗎
Anyone copy? Repeat, do you copy?

427
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,900
想得美  我的面具有夜視功能
Nice try. My mask has night vision.

428
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,880
正是我們所希望的  手電筒
That's what we're counting on, flashlights.

429
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,740
發生什么事了
What is going on?

430
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,970
他們偷襲了他
They ambushed him.

431
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,060
我想我們抓住他了
I think we got him h-here.

432
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,490
開燈
Turn the lights on.

433
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,860
我抓不住他  你屁股還坐在我臉上
I cannot hold him with your posterior in my face!

434
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,570
好吧  我正在讓他的槍遠離我們
Well, I'm aiming his gun away from us.

435
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,160
樂樂  拿下他的面具
Happy, pull his mask off.

436
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,090
你吃了什么
What have you been eating?!

437
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,130
-好吧  -好  好
- Okay. - Good, good.

438
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,400
他睡覺了
He's gone night-night.

439
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,210
好吧
Okay...

440
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,770
我們只剩不到半小時的時間
we have less than half an hour

441
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,550
但是綽綽有余了
but that should be more than enough.

442
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,490
聽著伙計們  你們繼續和我們保持聯系
Here, guys, you can stay on the comms with us,

443
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,750
但我覺得我們可以的
but I think we're okay.

444
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,220
好
Okay.

445
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,990
在此期間  我們幫拉爾夫贏了這件案子吧
In the meantime, let's get to work helping Ralph win this case.

446
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,230
沒錯
Yeah.

447
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,040
好了  現在空氣干凈了  可以呼吸了
Okay, the air is clean enough to breathe now.

448
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,060
我們從地震儀開始吧
Let's get going with the seismograph.

449
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,340
樂樂  這需要花多長時間
Happy, how long is it gonna take?

450
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,160
要是你不干擾我的話一下子就好了
Not long if you don't distract me.

451
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,610
你沒有告訴她你外出辦事嗎
You didn't tell her you were out on a case?

452
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,160
有  我告訴她了
Hmm? Yeah, I did.

453
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,670
可是那女人還在打電話
And yet the damsel still calls?

454
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,960
她太纏人了
Wow, she's jonesing bad.

455
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,220
她沒有少女綜合癥  她是喜歡我
She does not have Damsel Syndrome. She likes me for me.

456
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,010
我設法獲得我按到正確數字時
I am trying to pick up microscopic tremors

457
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,890
保險銷所發出的微小震動
caused by the lock pins when I hit the right number.

458
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,250
我需要安靜  所以你們閉嘴
I need quiet, so both you damsels shut it.

459
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,870
那是什么
What the heck was that?

460
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,800
這是在基地射程范圍的炮火演練
It's artillery practice at the base firing range.

461
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,720
我們也聽到了
We hear it, too.

462
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,270
這些震動影響了讀數
The vibrations are screwing up my readings.

463
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,690
他們繼續在那里開火的話  我什么都做不了
I can't do my job with them blasting away up there.

464
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,200
希爾  你能幫我們解決嗎
Sly, can you help us out here?

465
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,750
已經侵入了基地的系統
Already in the base's system.

466
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,830
它們不是沒有聯網嗎
I thought they were air-gapped.

467
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,110
諾克斯堡金庫是沒有網
Fort Knox Depository is,

468
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,810
但基地的其他地方是聯機的
but the rest of the base is online and vulnerable

469
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,300
并且容易被我入侵的
to my skills.

470
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,260
{\an8}基地操作  允許訪問

471
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,410
搞定
Yahtzee!

472
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,390
好  根據他們的測試進度表
Okay, according to their testing schedule,

473
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,640
他們正在安裝一臺新的破擊跑自動發射器
they are setting off a new automated mortar launcher.

474
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,180
大概還需要一個小時
It's gonna be going on for another hour.

475
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,560
你沒有那么長時間了
You don't have that long.

476
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,950
而我只知道四個組合編碼的其中兩個
And I've only got two of the four combination numbers.

477
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,400
猜猜剩下的那兩個
Try guessing the last two.

478
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,270
刻度盤上有100個數字  選兩個數字
There's 100 numbers on the dial, two numbers left--

479
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,280
有一萬種可能
that's 10,000 possibilities.

480
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,630
我們需要停止炮擊
We have to stop the shelling.

481
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,190
凱布  我需要你去阻止一下
Cabe, I need you to make a pit stop

482
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,080
而且  你不會喜歡這樣的
and, uh, you're not gonna like it.

483
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,500
天吶
Oh, boy.

484
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,070
很短
Short.

485
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,170
調整兩英里  準備好發射
Adjust 2 mills and fire when ready.

486
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,550
等一下
Wait.

487
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,850
這是
What in the...

488
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,370
停火  有人進入射程范圍了
Hold your fire-- there's someone on the range.

489
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,530
停火
Hold fire!

490
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,600
來吧
Here we go.

491
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,550
士兵們正端著來復槍向我們沖來
There are soldiers running at us with rifles.

492
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,630
沒錯
Yup.

493
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,040
藏起通訊器  拿出證件
Hide your comms. Get your badge out.

494
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,060
我們要開始耍嘴皮子了
We've got some explaining to do.

495
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,270
怎么了  長官
Problem, Officer?

496
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,830
好了
Got it!

497
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,040
需要搜索的房間很多
There's a lot of rooms to search.

498
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,660
好  我們來縮小范圍
Okay, okay, we'll narrow it down.

499
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,940
根據諾克斯堡建造的年份
So, we'll take the year that Fort Knox was built

500
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,910
和歷史學家提供的黃金儲量
and how much gold historians say was stored here,

501
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,490
判斷每間庫房里有多少
then divide it by how many bars fit into each cell,

502
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,650
然后看一看權杖是
and then consider the year the scepter 

503
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,750
哪年被送進保險庫的
was brought to the vault so...

504
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,800
或者看下物品清單
Or we could just check the manifest.

505
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,530
就掛在這里的墻上
It was hanging right here on the wall.

506
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,300
權杖在8號庫房
Scepter's in cell eight.

507
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,780
海伍德
Heywood.

508
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,320
你來了
Wh.. there you are, hey.

509
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,250
拉爾夫在哪
Where's Ralph?

510
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,580
還在和希爾一起找文件
Still searching documents with Sly.

511
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,760
你得再爭取些時間
You have to buy more time.

512
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,960
法官已經非常討厭我了
The judge hates me already.

513
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,660
我要是再拖延時間  他會判我蔑視法庭
If I buy more time, he's gonna find me in contempt.

514
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,340
你能想出辦法的  你是個好律師啊
Well, you'll figure something out. You're a good lawyer.

515
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,690
你今天早上不是也看見了嗎
Were you not in court this morning?

516
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,110
我就是個爛律師
I'm a terrible lawyer.

517
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,230
不對
That's not true.

518
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,410
你真正關心委托人
Y-you care about your clients,

519
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,290
這已經比其他律師強了
that's more than most lawyers.

520
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,660
想一想
Ask yourself:

521
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,060
你為什么選擇成為一名律師
why are you an attorney instead of anything else in the world?

522
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,730
一定有很重要的原因
I know there's an important reason.

523
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,900
我小時候  家里的爐子壞了
Uh... w-when I was a kid our oil burner broke.

524
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,180
超級冷
Our house was freezing.

525
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,570
我媽雇來的修理工越修越壞
The guys my mother hired to fix it just made it worse,

526
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,130
我媽就把他們告上了小額索賠法庭
so, she took them to small claims court.

527
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,160
花了380美元
$380 bucks,

528
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,910
當時那是我們僅有的積蓄
but it was all we had,

529
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,270
她勝訴了
and, uh, she won.

530
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,260
于是
So...

531
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,100
家里又重獲了溫暖
our house was warm once again.

532
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,870
這可能就是我想保護小家伙的原因吧
I guess-I guess that's why I want to protect the little guy, too.

533
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,370
拉爾夫對你來說再小不過了
Well, you don't get more little than Ralph.

534
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,260
做點讓你媽媽自豪的事  好嗎
Go make your mom proud, okay?

535
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,930
我會的
I will.

536
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,980
法警  因藐視法庭罪羈押莫里斯先生
Bailiff, take Mr. Morris into custody for contempt of court.

537
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,570
-我讓你找一名專家  -怎么
- I asked for an expert  -What?!

538
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,500
來證明你委托人的能力
to testify to your client's competency

539
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,590
你卻跟我說什么
and you give me a story about a doctor

540
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,210
有個醫生被困在了諾克斯堡
being stuck in Fort Knox!

541
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,930
你干得不錯  給拉爾夫爭取了時間
You did great; you got Ralph more time.

542
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,030
我不能去縣法庭
I can't go to County.

543
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,110
我在那兒給不少人打輸了官司
I lost a bunch of cases for guys in there.

544
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,750
得讓托比來作證  你們得叫托比回來
We need Toby to testify! You got to get Toby back in here!

545
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,700
你確定這下面有壓力板嗎
Are you sure it's on a pressure plate?

546
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,180
里面的凸起正好就在外固定上面
See how the interior ridge is just above the outer frame?

547
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,590
這是因為彈簧
Well, that's 'cause the springs are compressed 

548
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,040
被權杖的重量壓了下去
by the weight of the scepter.

549
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,690
一旦拿起權杖  就會發生不好的事情
Okay... we lift it, something bad happens.

550
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,760
這地方誰設計的  007里面的反派么
Who built this place, a Bond villain?

551
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,780
我們能做到
We can do it.

552
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,830
真的  你覺得你能搞定
Really? What makes you think

553
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,500
印第安納·瓊斯都搞不定的機關嗎
you can handle a switcheroo Indiana Jones couldn't pull off?

554
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,610
一塊巨石差點把他碾成肉醬
A giant boulder almost crushed him.

555
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,210
印第安納·瓊斯是誰  某州參議員么
Who's Indiana Jones? A state senator?

556
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,640
我是名機械師
I am a mechanic.

557
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,680
這輩子都在跟重量和測算打交道
I spend my life eyeballing weights and measures.

558
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,150
希爾  你看見權杖了嗎
Sly, you got eyes on the scepter?

559
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,520
已經在計算它的重量
Already calculating its weight.

560
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,110
{\an8}德國與波蘭因珍貴文物歸屬問題產生爭執

561
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,120
圓柱體積πr2×h
The volume of a cylinder is pi-r-squared times height.

562
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,230
上面球的體積4/3πr3
The spherical top is four-thirds pi-r-cubed.

563
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,360
黃金重量是個常數
The weight of gold is a constant, and, uh,

564
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,630
珠寶的重量就需要猜了
I'm gonna have to guestimate on the jewels

565
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,990
但我會盡量猜得準一點
but I'm gonna be close...

566
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,870
共2.8千克
six pounds, four ounces.

567
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,430
這樣應該可以了
Okay, that should do it.

568
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,480
確定嗎
You sure?

569
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,590
我了解工具
I know tools.

570
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,210
它們的重量的誤差是非常細微的
They'll match the weight within a fraction of an ounce.

571
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,190
好吧  數三下
Okay, on three.

572
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,990
一
One...

573
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,310
二
Two...

574
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,550
三
Three!

575
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,100
看見沒有  諾克斯堡
Take that, Fort Knox.

576
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,580
應該叫你"別想阻止
It's more like Fort Not..

577
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,550
我們這些天才的腳步堡"
Gonna Stop Us 'Cause We're Geniuses...

578
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,080
糟糕了
That's a problem.

579
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,140
怎么了
What's going on?

580
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,710
可別是塊大石頭啊
Please, don't be a boulder.

581
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,390
好吧  這比石頭嚴重多了
All right, that-that is worse than a boulder.

582
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,290
水肯定是從某個儲水槽過來的
They must be feeding a pipe from a storage tank

583
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,350
水量應該剛好能
that is just enough water

584
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,530
沒過整個房間淹死我們
to fill the room and kill us.

585
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,160
這應該就是庫克提醒我們的
I guess this is one of the unknown traps

586
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,320
未知陷阱之一了
that Cook warned us about!

587
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,230
我們怎么觸發這個的
Okay, how did we trip this thing?

588
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,470
我們的計算不會有錯啊
Our calculations were perfect!

589
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,330
沒時間想了
There's not enough time!

590
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,740
來  過來
Here, here! Come here!

591
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,650
水在增加
The water's filling.

592
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,830
來幫我開門
Come help me with the door.

593
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,410
有個水淹陷阱
There's a water trap in there?

594
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,490
伙計們  那房間非常小
Guys, that room is incredibly small.

595
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,870
水流進去的速度有多快
How fast is the water entering?

596
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,940
快到能淹死人了
Fast enough!

597
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,230
這門打不開
This thing isn't budging.

598
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,330
沒法從這里出去了
We can't get out this way.

599
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,230
得想辦法堵住進水口
We've got to find something to stop up the hole.

600
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,230
不  就讓水流進去
No, let the water in!

601
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,780
水充滿整個房間后
With the door straining

602
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,840
門會承受水壓
against the pressure of a room full of water

603
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,970
就容易打開了
it'll be vulnerable.

604
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,750
他說得對
He's right!

605
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,270
阿基米德杠桿原理
It's Archimedes' Law of the Lever.

606
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,550
當施加動力的位置
If the distance from the fulcrum

607
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,540
到支點的距離
to where the input force is applied is greater than

608
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,610
比阻力施加的位置
the distance from the fulcrum

609
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,150
到支點的距離要長時
to where the output force is applied,

610
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,590
動力就會被增強
then the lever amplifies the input force.

611
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,130
所以我們需要一根撬棍是嗎
You're saying we need a crowbar?

612
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,770
沒錯  趕快找
Yes, exactly! Start looking!

613
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,150
希曼之劍可以嗎
Would He-Man's sword work?

614
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,010
那些紋路說明這是大馬士革鋼
These wavy patterns indicate Damascus steel, 

615
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,680
最堅硬的金屬之一
some of the toughest in history.

616
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,930
好的  一起拉
Okay, okay, let's pull together.

617
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,520
還是紋絲不動
This thing isn't budging.

618
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,380
有人感到水里有一絲暖意嗎
If anyone notices the water getting warmer,

619
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,880
那只是因為我嚇尿了而已
it's just 'cause I'm scared.

620
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,570
加油  伙計們  你們做得到
Come on, guys, you can do this.

621
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,530
好
Okay.

622
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,870
聽我數
On my count!

623
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,720
吸最后一口氣
We take one last breath... Okay.

624
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,190
然后一起使出全力  好嗎
...and then we give it everything we got! Okay?

625
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,570
都還好嗎
Everyone okay?

626
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,430
好  樂樂呢
Good. Happy?

627
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,330
不能更好
Never better.

628
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,000
門終于松動了
Okay, the door's compromised.

629
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,330
我們現在可以打開它了
Now we can open it and beat it.

630
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,740
好  雖然門外的警衛已經暈了
Good, 'cause the guards here might be passed out

631
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,000
但斯蒂爾森公司總部
but no way an alarm wasn't tripped

632
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,220
肯定也已經收到了警報
to Steelson headquarters.

633
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,600
隨時會派人來
There's gonna be men here any minute.

634
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,240
我不可能算錯了重量
I know I had the weight right.

635
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,150
超級天才也會犯錯
Mistakes happen, even to super geniuses.

636
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,860
不對  這東西感覺不像2.8千克
Not this one. This doesn't feel like six pounds.

637
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,740
它很輕
It's light.

638
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,610
那就是他們不再像以前那樣做權杖了
Well, they don't make scepters like they used to.

639
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,530
伙計們  有問題
Guys... we've got a problem.

640
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,500
這個問題更大
Not as big as this one!

641
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,120
他們進不來了
Now they can't get in.

642
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,010
我們也出不去了
And we can't get out.

643
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,710
即使他們從上級那里獲得密碼
Even if they get the combo from their superiors,

644
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,850
齒輪也會被卡住  這樣可以拖住他們
the gears will be jammed. That should slow them down.

645
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,360
好的  我們走
Good, let's go.

646
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,700
現在我們來考慮這瓶東西
Now let's focus on that vial,

647
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,580
考慮到庫克派我們來的原因  我要指出一點
AKA the real reason Cook sent us in here and let me point out,

648
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,410
是我提到了史泰龍電影里
it was I who referenced the Stallone film

649
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,370
英雄們被巨石壓倒
where the heroes get screwed.

650
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,230
還有人記得嗎
Does everyone remember that?

651
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,830
這像是一種粉塵  一種粉末
It's like a dust, like a powder.

652
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,150
是的  閃著銀光
Yeah, it's silvery,

653
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,840
一種銀灰色的粉末
it's-it's gray with a shimmer.

654
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,880
把它藏起來的人選擇了金子
Whoever hid this chose gold.

655
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,380
金子適合屏蔽輻射
Gold's good at shielding radiation.

656
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,970
我覺得我手中拿的是釙
I think I'm holding polonium.

657
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:25,930
趕緊放下
Put that down.

658
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,090
這就是殺死了脫離克格勃的
That's what killed the MI6 agent

659
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,380
軍情六處特工的罪魁禍首
that defected from the KGB.

660
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,970
沃特  這東西可是劇毒物
Walt, this stuff is crazy toxic.

661
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,950
一克可以殺死一千萬人
One gram can kill ten million people.

662
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,790
好的
Okay...

663
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,860
只要我們不攝入它就沒事
we're safe as long as we don't ingest it.

664
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,170
這應該有半斤
There's got to be half a pound here.

665
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,720
那足以消滅世界上四分之一的人口
That could wipe out a quarter of the world's population.

666
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,040
想象一下北京高層下令用噴粉飛機
Imagine this dispersed from a crop duster in the Midwest,

667
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,000
把這個灑在中西部地區
from the top of a skyscraper in Beijing.

668
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,580
庫克探員瞞著我們這一點
Agent Cook would only keep this from us

669
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,400
很可能因為他想用這一瓶做壞事
if he had bad plans for this vial.

670
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,270
希爾  我需要你調查一下庫克
Sly, I need you to look into Cook.

671
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,990
問問凱布  看看他是否能提供這家伙的背景
Talk to Cabe, see if he can give you any background on the guy.

672
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,130
我正在試著與他聯系
I've been trying to get in touch with him

673
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,460
但是他并沒有回應
but his comms aren't in.

674
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,340
好的
Okay.

675
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,730
與上校核實過了
Everything checks out with the Colonel.

676
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,760
這件事說起來很不好意思
Yeah... really embarrassed by all this.

677
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,590
我們
We, uh...

678
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,590
在路口轉錯了彎
just took a wrong turn on an access road,

679
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,040
沒有找到出口反而闖進了這里
wound up out here instead of heading toward the exit.

680
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,820
是的
Yes, sir.

681
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,440
現在你需要趕快找到出口
Well, now you need to find that exit

682
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,000
因為你延誤了我們的訓練
because you've delayed our training.

683
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,220
了解
Understood.

684
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,170
讓我們離開這
Let's get out of here.

685
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,350
凱布  你在哪
Cabe, where are you?

686
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,600
我在呢
All right, I'm here.

687
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,550
我們快成功了嗎
Are we almost wrapped up?

688
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,330
我們碰到了點問題
Well, we hit a speed bump.

689
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,590
我們過不去的
We're not getting through it.

690
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,310
如果我們順著管子到達儲水箱
If we follow the pipe to the reservoir tank

691
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,100
我們有可能離開這里
we might get out of here.

692
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,480
那些士兵切開保險庫門
It's only a matter of time before Steelson

693
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,870
只是時間問題
cuts through that vault door.

694
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,170
就是這個  我們把鋼條切開
That's it. We cut through the bars.

695
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,800
你的工具箱里有個標準的切管器
You have a standard pipe cutter in the tool box.

696
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,880
但是它切不開鋼條
It's not getting through steel.

697
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,280
給它裝上金剛石刀片就可以
It will with a diamond blade.

698
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,960
我走了四個街區去法院
I go four blocks to the courthouse and

699
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,980
結果麻煩接踵而至
all hell breaks loose.

700
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,930
可不是嗎  但是現在沒工夫討論這個
Apparently, but I can't discuss it right now

701
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,800
因為我正在收集庫克的信息
because I am gathering info on Cook.

702
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,370
沃特  你們快出來了嗎
Walter, you guys close to breaking out?

703
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,290
快了
Getting there.

704
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,450
他們也是
So are they.

705
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,680
他們切割的速度很快
They're cutting through pretty quick.

706
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,880
佩吉  我們一會兒會進入管道中
Paige, we'll be in the pipe in moments.

707
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,030
我們沒問題的
We're okay, we got this.

708
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,410
好的  保持聯絡
All right, well, keep us posted.

709
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,040
搞定
Got it.

710
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,290
托比  快過來
Toby, get down here!

711
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,130
我們要走了
We're leaving!

712
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,040
快點
Come on!

713
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,890
沃特  我們快到集合點了
Walter, we're almost at the rendezvous.

714
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,920
你們在哪
What's your 20?

715
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,660
今天第二次了
For the second time today,

716
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,410
再次非常靠近托比的屁股
very close to Toby's backside.

717
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,410
可能和釙一樣有毒
Could be as toxic as the polonium.

718
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,240
有件事  我調查不了庫克
About that, I can't look into Cook because

719
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,390
因為我不知道他的朋友是誰
I don't know who his friends are

720
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,440
而且我不想讓他知道
and I don't want to tip him off

721
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,050
我們發現了他的寶藏
that we found his hidden treasure.

722
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,410
聲音開始有回響了
Voices are starting to echo.

723
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,150
說明這里是開放式的
Means there's an open chamber.

724
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,580
好的  水就是從這來的
Okay. This is where the water came from.

725
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,030
這一定是他們用來向水箱灌水的艙口
Must be a hatch they use to fill the tank, right?

726
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,410
只是個閥門
It's just a valve.

727
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,730
從它的尺寸來看
Judging from the size of it,

728
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,230
我猜他們通過把管子
I'm guessing they fill this thing with a hose

729
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,360
接到液罐車來進行儲水
connected to a tanker truck.

730
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,820
太好了  所以我們爬進了一個死胡同
Oh, great. So we crawled into a dead end.

731
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,840
這個水箱埋在地下
This tank is buried underground.

732
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,290
他們快進來了
They're almost in.

733
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,680
至少我們已經深埋地下六尺了
Well, at least we're already six feet under.

734
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,100
省去了埋葬的時間了
It saves time with the burying.

735
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,200
從我們爬行的距離和角度判斷
From the distance and angle at which we crawled

736
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,660
我估測更像是地下三尺左右
I would estimate more like three feet underground.

737
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,830
謝謝糾正
Oh, thanks for clearing that up.

738
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,100
我可不想我在世上最后的話
I wouldn't want my last words on earth

739
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,460
是一句毫無意義的數學失誤
to be a meaningless mathematical error.

740
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,920
并不是毫無意義  它是有意義的
It's not meaningless. It's meaningful.

741
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,770
這三尺可以改變一切
That three feet makes all the difference in the world.

742
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,530
凱布
Cabe?

743
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,290
你離射擊場有多遠
How far are you from the artillery range?

744
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,730
我需要你征用一臺迫擊炮
I need you to commandeer a mortar launcher.

745
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,480
什么
What?!

746
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,940
這是不可能的  孩子
That's a no-go, son.

747
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,030
我已經離開基地了
I'm already off the base, 

748
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,180
而且我很慶幸我離開了因為你已經失去理智了
and I'm glad I am because you've lost your mind.

749
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,170
實際上  在不在基地沒有關系
Actually, being on the base doesn't matter.

750
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,970
在野戰炮部隊里  我仔細觀察了他們的設備
At the artillery field, I got a good look at their equipment.

751
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,600
其中一些迫擊炮  它們是自動的
Some of those launchers, they're automated.

752
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,880
它們可能十分容易被黑客入侵
That makes them potentially vulnerable to hackers.

753
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,530
如果黑了進去  對我們來說就不是"可能"了
When it comes to hacking, there's no "Potentially" with us.

754
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,240
你要武器想干什么
What do you need this weapon for?

755
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,740
我要把這個水箱炸個洞出來
To blow a hole in this tank.

756
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,860
真有意思  等一下
That's funny. For a second,

757
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,860
我覺得他在說向我們自己射一發炮彈
I thought he was suggesting they drop a bomb on us.

758
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,910
標準的迫擊炮彈  地下三尺
Standard mortar round, three feet of dirt,

759
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,140
板寸厚的鋼板  可能會行得通
half inch steel tank... it might work.

760
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,280
可能會殺了我們
Might kill us.

761
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,160
好的  我進去了
Okay, I'm in.

762
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,150
我控制了一臺迫擊炮
I have control of one of the mortar launchers.

763
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,680
守衛現在在保險庫
The guards are in the vault now.

764
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,810
他們隨時會抓到我們
They'll be on us in any minute.

765
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,630
希爾  我們從保險庫
Sly, we crawled about 60 feet

766
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,730
以七度角
at a seven degree incline

767
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,850
爬了大約18米  所以
from the vault room, so...

768
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,050
查一下地圖  估測一下坐標
Check a map and estimate the coordinates

769
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,380
然后發射迫擊炮
and fire that mortar.

770
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,170
好的
Okay...

771
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,780
但是我可能不會精確射中
but I'm not gonna be exact on this.

772
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,950
{\an8}發射

773
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,850
這不是你想估測就能估測的事情
This is not something you want to estimate.

774
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,940
這不是你能估測的事情
This is not something you estimate!

775
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,530
我能聽見守衛進入管道了
I can hear the guards entering the pipe.

776
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,670
趕快發射炮彈
Launch the mortar now.

777
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,620
好的
Okay.

778
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,330
沒事的
Here goes nothing.

779
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,270
來了
Incoming.

780
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,610
{\an8}發射

781
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,360
他發射了  我們進入管道里
He launched it, let's get in the pipe.

782
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,360
是琳達嗎
Is that Linda?

783
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,710
你在逗我嗎
You kidding me?

784
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,290
沃特  你聽得見嗎
Walter, can you hear me?!

785
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,120
說話  孩子
Speak up, son.

786
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,650
你讓我們很擔心
You're making us nervous over here.

787
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,330
我們沒事
We're okay.

788
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,400
謝天謝地
Oh, thank God.

789
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,930
這些家伙瘋了
These guys are insane.

790
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,250
這些家伙要讓我突發心臟病了
These guys are gonna give me a heart attack.

791
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,190
看到我的影子了
Oh, it's my shadow.

792
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,810
冬天還有6周才會過完
Six more weeks of winter.

793
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,810
{\an8}他在模仿美國的土撥鼠日  人們相信
如果土撥鼠出洞看到了自己影子  春天還有6周才會來

794
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,160
別想冬天還有6周的事情了
Forget six weeks of winter.

795
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,960
如果我們動作不快點的話
If we don't hurry

796
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,280
就要在監獄里蹲20年甚至一輩子了
it'll be 20 to life in prison!

797
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,400
快點  我們走吧
Come on, let's go!

798
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,880
站住
Freeze!

799
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,200
沃特  我找到了一些庫克的經歷
Walter, I found something on Cook.

800
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,430
發到你的手機里了
I'm sending it to your phone.

801
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,020
希爾  我現在可沒空看
Little busy now, Sly!

802
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,840
沃特  你必須要看一看
Walter... you need to see this.

803
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,190
跟我們說說
Download us...

804
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,500
重點內容吧
bullet points!

805
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,440
我黑進了他在情報機關的記錄
I hacked his intelligence service record.

806
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,640
27年前  庫克是一名
27 years ago, Cook was

807
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,040
在東德工作的美國秘密探員
a secret U.S. Operative in East Germany.

808
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,880
他的一個聯系人參與了東德的
One of his contacts included

809
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,290
大規模殺傷性武器計劃
a man in a WMD program

810
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,290
{\an8}探員履歷記錄

811
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,250
那個人的專長就是放射性武器
in East Germany, and his specialty was radioactive weaponry.

812
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,540
當柏林墻被推倒的時候  他出于安全的考慮
When the wall came down, he hid his radioactive material

813
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,220
把放射性物質藏在了權杖里
in the scepter figuring what could be safer.

814
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,630
在波蘭聲稱權杖本應歸他們所有的時候
And when Poland claimed the piece was originally theirs,

815
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,450
權杖和它里面的物品就被轉移到了諾克斯堡
then the scepter and its contents made its way to Fort Knox.

816
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,270
自然界中存在的釙極其稀少
Polonium is incredibly rare in nature.

817
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,440
想買都買不到
You can't get your hands on this stuff.

818
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,650
釙在黑市上的需求一定非常龐大
Black market must be huge.

819
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,280
所以庫克發現了
So Cook saw an opportunity

820
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,140
諾克斯改變安保安排的機會
in the security change at Knox,

821
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,290
他打算乘虛而入
and he jumped at it.

822
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,930
好了
Okay.

823
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,980
我覺得我們暫時甩掉他們了
I think we lost them but not for long.

824
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,350
好了  讓我們整理一下現在是什么情況
All right, let's get our bearings.

825
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,870
天啊  庫克來了
Oh, man, that's Cook.

826
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,880
我們有麻煩了
That's a problem.

827
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,880
他想拿到這個大規模殺傷性武器
Uh, he's gonna want this weapon of mass destruction.

828
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,660
我們該怎么辦
What do we do?

829
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,570
我有辦法
I have a plan.

830
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,330
你們在里面到底做了什么
What the hell did you guys do back there?

831
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,660
整個基地都戒嚴了
The whole place is lit up.

832
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,130
你們拿到權杖了嗎
Did you get the scepter?

833
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,910
拿到了  樂樂  給他吧
We did. Happy, give it to him.

834
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,120
做得不錯  天蝎團隊
Good work, Scorpion.

835
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,390
祖國對于你們出色的表現表示感謝
Your country thanks you for a job well done.

836
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,220
如果我是你的話  我會趕緊逃走
Now I'd get lost if I were you.

837
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,150
等一下
W-wait, uh...

838
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,020
這里還有一顆鉆石
you forgot a diamond.

839
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,860
有點臟了
It's a little smudged,

840
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,120
因為我們用它切割金屬來著
'cause, uh, we used it to cut through steel.

841
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,300
好吧
Okay.

842
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,830
你們剛剛放走的這個人
You guys just let a man 

843
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,800
他攜帶的放射性物質
go with enough radioactive material

844
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,260
足以毀掉一整片大陸
to take out a continent.

845
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,110
希望你的計劃能成功
I hope you know what you're doing.

846
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,450
我也是
Me, too.

847
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,120
大家都聽著
Guys, listen up,

848
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,430
托比  我需要兩個松果
So, Toby, I need two pinecones,

849
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,990
樂樂  我需要一些火藥
and, Happy, I need gunpowder.

850
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,000
這些是我能找到的
These are the biggest pinecones I could find

851
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,700
帶有樹脂的最大的松果了
with sap on them.

852
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,710
應該可以黏住火藥了
Should be sticky enough to hold the gunpowder.

853
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,470
蒂姆給了你幾顆子彈
How many bullets did Tim give you?

854
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,780
6顆  足夠了
Six, more than enough.

855
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,310
你看到蒂姆和凱布了嗎
Do you see Tim and Cabe?

856
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,820
沒  他們已經藏好了
No, they're well hidden.

857
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,400
我們這么做太蠢了
This is dumb.

858
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,280
再闖一次諾克斯已經夠瘋狂了
The idea of breaking back into Knox is crazy enough

859
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,800
還要等在這里  試圖干掉那些
but waiting here in the hopes we can take out

860
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,900
追我們的警衛  這簡直是異想天開
those guards on our tail is wishful thinking.

861
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,800
如果我們現在跑到樹林里
If we run into the woods now

862
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,840
被他們抓住  一切就都完了
and get caught, it's over.

863
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,550
在這里等是值得的
It's worth the wait.

864
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,880
好了  別說了  他們來了
Anyway, shut up, they're here.

865
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,740
車在啟動狀態
It's running.

866
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,030
這也許是他們用來逃跑的車
Maybe this was their getaway car,

867
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,680
但是他們在樹林里沒找到
but they couldn't find it in the woods.

868
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,980
我要上報了
I'm calling it in.

869
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,840
抱歉  我還以為這里可以停車呢
Sorry, thought I could park here.

870
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,340
比窒息性毒氣還管用
Better than knockout gas.

871
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,800
樹林安全了  出來吧
Woods are clear. Get moving.

872
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,810
收到
Copy that.

873
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,100
軍警要去調查保險庫  已經上路了
MP's are on the way to investigate the vault.

874
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,110
保持高度警惕
Remain on high alert.

875
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,930
遵命
Yes, sir.

876
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,830
好了  把打火機給我
Okay, give me the lighter.

877
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,590
這個計劃太瘋狂了[直譯為是堅果]
This plan is nuts.

878
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,020
準確地說  這個計劃是種子
Actually, the plan is seeds.

879
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,520
種子經過加熱會炸裂  發出開槍一樣的聲音
When the seeds heat up they will pop like gunfire.

880
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,010
相信我吧
Trust me.

881
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,430
叫我怎么相信一個剛剛用了
How can I trust someone

882
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,210
有關堅果和種子的雙關語的人
who just made a nuts and seeds pun?

883
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,400
好了
Okay.

884
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,780
拿著這個
Hold that.

885
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,080
10點鐘方向有槍聲
Gunfire at 10:00!

886
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,280
有多個射手  快散開
Multiple shooters! Spread out!

887
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,090
快散開
Fan out!

888
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,580
這是老師給你的校園通行證
Here's your hall pass.

889
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,340
別讓校長抓到你
Don't let the principal catch you.

890
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,320
我發誓我帶了證件  聽著
I swear I had it. Look...

891
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,340
我是國防部的
I'm DOD.

892
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,200
列兵戴維斯  這里是正門
Private Davis, Main Gate.

893
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,730
他現在就在這里
He's here with me now.

894
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,950
明白了
Understood.

895
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,620
我可以走了吧
So, it's squared away?

896
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,130
庫克探員  你被捕了
Agent Cook, you're under arrest.

897
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,080
把手放在方向盤上
Hands on the wheel.

898
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,100
等一下
Hold on!

899
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,100
你們弄錯了
This is a mistake!

900
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,990
把手放在方向盤上
Hands on the wheel!

901
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,940
他們在保險庫里找到了你的證件
Your ID's been found... in the vault.

902
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,800
先生
Sir...

903
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,340
那些混蛋
Those bastards.

904
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,480
狄寧女士
Ms. Dineen,

905
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,190
你有沒有讓你兒子去做能力評估
have you had your son evaluated for competency?

906
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,940
有的  法官大人
Yes, Your Honor.

907
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,580
柯蒂斯醫生這里有完整的報告
Dr. Curtis here has a full report.

908
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,360
行了
Hep.

909
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,420
柯蒂斯先生  你是一個真正的醫生嗎
Mr. Curtis, are you a real doctor?

910
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,960
哈佛醫學院畢業  碩士學位
Harvard Medical School with a Masters in...

911
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,640
行了  這個孩子有足夠的能力嗎
Hep. Is the kid competent?

912
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,600
當然了
Absolutely.

913
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,130
這件事我從一開始就知道了
A fact I was well aware of from the outset.

914
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,700
他的律師在哪兒呢
Where is his counsel?

915
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,900
我在這兒呢  法官大人
I'm right here, Your Honor.

916
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,650
我被關起來之后
Since I was incarcerated, 

917
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,740
還沒有機會跟我的客戶對話
I didn't have a chance to confer with my client.

918
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,850
給你十秒鐘把要說的說了
Ten seconds, then get to it.

919
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,690
我是準備好了呢
Will I seem like a prepared lawyer

920
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,910
還是沒有準備好
or an ill-prepared lawyer?

921
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,440
準備好了
Prepared.

922
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,580
太好了
Sweet.

923
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,380
拉爾夫  你已經把這份
Ralph, you had the opportunity to review the work product

924
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,310
教授聲稱是他原創的代碼  重新審評過了
that your professor claims is his own.

925
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:57,900
是的
I did.

926
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,070
跟我說說你發現了什么
Tell me what you uncovered.

927
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,730
我會同時編寫并修改代碼的方方面面
I work on and revise many aspects of the code at the same time, 

928
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,280
為了方便查找  我會用特別的日期做書簽
so to keep from getting lost I use bookmarks, specific dates.

929
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,250
拉爾夫  你可以支出這些占位符嗎
Ralph, can you point out these placeholders?

930
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,740
法官大人  我反對
Objection, Your Honor.

931
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,090
我的客戶也會用書簽
My client uses bookmarks as well.

932
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,050
根本沒辦法證明是這個孩子寫了那些書簽
There's no way to prove anything in there came from this child.

933
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,050
我可以證明
I can prove it.

934
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,530
反對無效
Overruled.

935
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,410
繼續說
Go ahead.

936
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,790
我會使用那些對我來說很重要的日期
I use dates that are important to me.

937
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,330
首先是我的生日  2005年12月11日
The first here is my birthday, 12-11-2005,

938
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,340
這個日子很重要是因為我很喜歡我的生活
important because I enjoy my life.

939
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,490
出生證明  已經蓋章并做了公證
Birth certificate, stamped and certified,

940
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,910
完全按規章制度辦事
like it totally should be.

941
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,390
在這個日期的下面
Directly under it,

942
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,040
是1986年4月13日
4-13-1986,

943
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,120
我媽媽的生日
my mom's birthday.

944
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,560
這個日期很重要是因為她是最棒的媽媽
Important because her mothering instincts are superlative.

945
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,700
這是她的駕照
Her license.

946
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,040
我今天的表現棒棒的
Really on my game today.

947
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,940
那一頁上面的日期是
And on that page,

948
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,030
2014年9月22日
9-22-2014,

949
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,960
我和沃特·奧布萊恩初次相遇的日子
the day I first met Walter O'Brien.

950
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,050
這個日子很重要
That's important

951
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,030
是因為那一天我意識到自己不再孤獨
because it's the day I realized I wasn't alone.

952
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,110
他告訴我世上有人和我一樣
He taught me there were others like me

953
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,620
也有人關心我
who cared about me.

954
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,420
我可以證明這個日期
I can verify that date with, uh,

955
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,930
我有一張尼莫斯餐廳老板開的發票
an invoice from the owner of Nemos Diner

956
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,120
我在那里修路由器時第一次遇見了
where I was fixing a router and when I first met Ms. Dineen

957
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,140
狄寧女士和她了不起的兒子拉爾夫
and her amazing son, Ralph.

958
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,990
我沒問你
I didn't ask.

959
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,850
好吧  就是
Okay, it's just, uh...

960
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,290
那也是我人生中非常重要的一天
...it was a very important day in my life, too.

961
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,100
我準備見好就收
I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead.

962
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,550
被告  還有問題嗎
Defense, any cross?

963
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,060
目前沒有
We have nothing at this time.

964
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,460
那我要作出裁決了
Then I have a ruling.

965
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,400
你的委托人應該為自己感到羞恥
Your client should be ashamed of himself.

966
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,620
我判原告獲勝
I rule in favor of Plaintiff.

967
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,950
他敲了小錘子判我贏了
He hit the little hammer in my favor.

968
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,050
這是人生第一次
It's the first time ever.

969
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,050
我贏了
I'm a winner!

970
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,360
我一直在想法官會把我們傳回去改判
I keep thinking the judge is gonna call and reverse the decision,

971
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,790
但是這不合法
but it's not legal.

972
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,130
我查過了
I checked.

973
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,080
你做得很棒
You did an amazing job.

974
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,420
謝了
Oh, thanks.

975
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,960
你們這些人真是太贊了
You have a really fantastic group of people here.

976
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,090
你們支持我  寬容我
Supportive... forgiving.

977
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,440
我只想感謝你
Um, and I just wanted to thank you for...

978
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,580
是你們讓我相信自己
for helping me believe in myself.

979
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,710
你應該相信自己
You should.

980
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,070
你是個很好的律師
You're... a really good lawyer.

981
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,500
謝謝
Thank you.

982
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,360
是我媽媽
Oh, it's my mom.

983
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,470
媽媽  我贏了
Yeah, hi, Mom. Yeah, I won.

984
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,970
是啊  我也不敢相信
Uh-huh, yeah, I can't believe it either.

985
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,920
伙計
Hey, buddy.

986
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,370
你把我們相遇的日子寫進代碼
It means a lot to me

987
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,930
這對我意義重大
that you put the day that we first met in your code.

988
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,510
真抱歉之前對你不耐煩
I'm sorry for being curt with you before.

989
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,780
沒關系的
It's okay.

990
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,660
不  有關系
No, it's not.

991
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:45,950
我
I, um...

992
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,110
我不會再這樣了
it won't happen again.

993
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,840
但是我相信我說過的話
I do, though, believe in what I said.

994
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,560
好吧
Okay.

995
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,940
我不能理解
I couldn't understand

996
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,820
你那些特別復雜的代碼的具體內容
the details in your incredibly complex code.

997
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,930
我以前以為
I used to think that I-I had

998
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,700
我的智商是全世界第四高的
the fourth highest IQ in the world,

999
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:10,750
但是現在我明白你把我擠到第五名了
but now I realized that you have dropped me down to number five.

1000
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,000
你是因為這個才不開心
That's what got you upset?

1001
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,430
不是的
No.

1002
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,750
我只是怕你愿意為我而放慢腳步
No, what upset me is that you were willing to slow down

1003
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,740
讓我一直錯下去
for me to-to let me go down the wrong road,

1004
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,080
因為我不能理解你的作品
when that would've hindered you,

1005
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,760
而拖了你的后腿
because I couldn't grasp your work.

1006
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,670
永遠不要讓任何人成為你智商的牽絆
Never hobble your intelligence for anyone...

1007
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,100
如果你在這個車庫里都要妥協
because if you do that in this garage,

1008
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,400
想想你在外面的世界里
imagine what you'll have to do out there...

1009
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,460
會為普通人妥協多少
for humans.

1010
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,230
這個世界需要跟上你的思路
The world needs to catch up to you...

1011
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,590
因為你想想看  只要他們跟上一點點
because if-if it can, just a little,

1012
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,090
這個世界
imagine what a...

1013
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,170
就會變得更加美好
a beautiful place it could be.

1014
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,650
沃特
Hey, Walter.

1015
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,040
有人來找你了
You have a visitor.

1016
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,450
琳達
Linda...

1017
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,180
謝謝你來這兒找我
Um, thanks for meeting me here.

1018
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,070
你準備好了嗎
You... are you ready?

1019
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,000
這個派對看著很有趣呢
Looks like a fun party.

1020
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,940
我們留下也行
We can stay.

1021
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,470
你先吃完盤里的東西吧
You can finish your plate.

1022
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,170
是的  墨西哥辣卷
Oh, yes, the, uh, the jalapeno poppers.

1023
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,760
實際上  墨西哥辣椒中的辣椒素
They're... actually, the capsaicin in the jalapeno

1024
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,420
很有益健康
has many health benefits.

1025
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,200
真不錯  我嘗嘗
Cool, I'll give one a shot.

1026
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,890
不行  不行
Oh, no, no, no!

1027
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,440
面糊里有玉米的
There's corn in the batter, yeah.

1028
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,460
我記得第一次約會的時候
Yeah, uh, I-I remember on our first date

1029
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,890
你說過對玉米過敏
you said you were allergic.

1030
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,800
你以為我自己知道呢
Yeah, you think I would know that.

1031
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,520
是啊
Yeah.

1032
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,040
其實  我確實知道
Uh, actually, I did know that.

1033
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
但是你還要吃
But you were gonna eat it anyway?

1034
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,700
我猜是你讓我變得熱愛冒險了吧
Guess you make me adventurous.

1035
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,450
琳達  問你個問題可以嗎
Linda, may I ask you a question?

1036
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,740
當然可以
Of course.

1037
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,690
你是真的喜歡我
Do you really like me?

1038
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,630
還是因為在我身邊
Or does being around me

1039
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,670
讓你想起我救你時候的感覺
remind you of a sense memory when you were saved,

1040
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,450
你真正喜歡的是這種感覺
and that's what you, uh, really like?

1041
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,380
是不是  因為我覺得是后者
Is... because I-I think it's the latter.

1042
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,300
這太荒唐了
That's crazy.

1043
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,060
是嗎
Is it?

1044
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,160
你是不是
Is, um...

1045
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,390
你真的喜歡咸魚和
do you really like fermented fish and-and,

1046
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,880
臭花嗎
uh, smelly flowers?

1047
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,920
你喜歡我這種
D-Do you like a guy

1048
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:08,400
喜歡這種東西的人嗎
who likes those-those kind of things?

1049
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,820
我不好說
I'm not sure.

1050
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,470
怪不得
it would explain how I sat

1051
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,570
我可以耐著性子看完那個非洲蜂遷移的紀錄片
through that documentary on African bee migration.

1052
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,200
我是說  你不是真心喜歡我也沒關系的
Well, that's, uh, it's-it's okay that you don't really like me.

1053
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,710
但是 你此時此刻為我所做的一切
But... what you're doing for me

1054
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,600
讓我...喜歡你
right now makes me... like you.

1055
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,720
只是不是那種喜歡
Just not in-in that kind of way.

1056
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,370
沒關系的  沒關系的
It's okay, it's okay.

1057
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,340
我能理解
I understand.

1058
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,080
我們還是朋友嗎
Still friends?

1059
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,420
我們永遠都是朋友
Always friends.

1060
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,630
好吧
Oh, yeah.

1061
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,720
再見了  智多星
Good-bye, smarty-pants.

1062
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,690
我只是想來道別
I just wanted to say bye.

1063
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,700
我要趕去西雅圖的航班
I'm getting on a plane going to Seattle,

1064
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,490
找專家看我的后背
uh, see a specialist about my back,

1065
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,270
希望能痊愈復職
hopefully get cleared for duty.

1066
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,350
祝你一切順利
Oh. I hope that works out for you.

1067
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,800
我也希望
Me, too. Um,

1068
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:36,830
不管結果如何  我想回來以后
Regardless, I was thinking when I got back,

1069
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,780
我們可以一起出去吃頓飯嗎
maybe you and I could get a meal together...

1070
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,160
去餐廳
at a restaurant --

1071
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,530
正式的餐廳  不是科沃斯基那種
a real restaurant, not Kovelsky's.

1072
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,280
就像
Oh, like a...

1073
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,720
-約會那種  -約會嗎  就是
- date? - Date, yes.

1074
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,080
我不強求
Only if you'd like.

1075
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,360
我很愿意
Yeah, I would love to.

1076
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,960
太好了
Great.

1077
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,410
你看他們  他和她
Would you look at them? He's dealing with her, she's dealing with him,

1078
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,280
她和才應該在一起  真是白癡
and they should be dealing with each other. They're morons.

1079
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,280
我們才不會這樣  我們保持隨意對吧
That's never gonna be us -- we keep it easy, right?

1080
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,060
我手最笨了  不好意思
King Klutz over here, I'm sorry.

1081
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,530
沒事  醫生  我死不了
Okay, Doc, I'll live.

1082
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,800
我去拿點鱷梨醬和薯片
I'm grab us some, uh, guac and chips.

1083
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,170
你要確定算對了
Make sure you get it right.

1084
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,370
有了這塊水漬  我五分鐘
With this stain, I can extrapolate

1085
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,810
就能估算出她的戒指尺寸
her ring size in five minutes.

1086
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,320
隨意一點就好
Just keeping it easy.
