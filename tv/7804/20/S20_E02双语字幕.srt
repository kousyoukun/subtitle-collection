今晚 我打了网球
Tonight, I play tennis.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
理查德指着一辆面包车
Richard points at a minibus.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,200
詹姆斯和两个男人握手
And James shakes hands with two men.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,200
非常感谢 大家好 欢迎你们
Thank you so much. Hello!
Hello, everybody, and welcome.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,000
非常感谢 谢谢
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Now...

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,000
好了 几年前
Now, a few years ago,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,800
一家总部位于柴郡的 名叫BAC的工程公司
bosses at a Cheshire-based
engineering company called BAC

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,520
计划开发一辆车
decided they'd like to make a car.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,320
既然他们在柴郡 我猜他们可能
Now, because they're from
Cheshire, I assumed it would be made

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,160
用缟玛瑙或者牛眼花纹玻璃来造车窗
from onyx and have bull's-eye glass
in the windows

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,000
后视镜也许就会弄成韦恩鲁尼耳朵的样子
但他们没有这么做
and then door mirrors made
out of Wayne Rooney's ears. But no.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,640
他们认为这车
They decided it should have

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,640
应该使用福特货车的四缸发动机
the four-cylinder engine
from a Ford people van,

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
和F3赛车的变速箱
the gearbox from a Formula 3 racing
car

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,160
而车的内饰
and that it should be upholstered

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,040
也要用上不锈钢及防水材料
in the same stain-resistant and waterproof material

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,880
好比老人家里的拼装家具
that they use to line furniture
in old people's homes.

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,440
继而 他们把注意力放在了车的外观
And then they turned their attention
to how it should look.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,200
市面上大多汽车设计的灵感来源
Most car designers,
for their inspiration,

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,680
来自像大猫 蝙蝠 战斗机
go to big cats
and bats and jet fighters.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,520
但是这些柴郡的人们 一个都不喜欢
But the men from Cheshire decided
they didn't want any of that.

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,960
他们想要从这个玩意获取灵感
They decided to take
their inspiration from this.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,880
比约克专辑里 冰岛机器人的设计
So, the styling of an Icelandic
robot from a Bjork pop video,

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,480
赛车变速箱 还有小货车的发动机
the gearbox from a racing car
and the engine from a van.

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,360
东拼西凑后的产物 就是它
Bring them all together,
and this is the result.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,240
名叫Mono 它是个神奇的东西
It's called the Mono,
and it's amazing.

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,360
引擎来自福特多用途车
The engine may be
from a Ford people carrier,

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,240
但经由考斯沃斯调教 如今它输出280马力
but it's been fettled by Cosworth,
so now it produces 280 horsepower.

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,200
有了一台280马力的心脏
And fitting a 280 horsepower heart

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,280
对一台重量不过半吨的车
in a car which weighs
just half a tonne is...

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,440
最终结果 就没那么简单了
Well, the effects
are going to be profound.

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,560
我终于知道他们为什么
I can see why they lined it

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,480
使用防尿湿材料了
with material designed to resist
trouser accidents,

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,680
因为我的膀胱快炸了
because my bladder's gone!

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,320
完全兜不住了 我吓尿了
It's completely gone!
I've wet myself.

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,600
0到60英里加速 只需2.8秒
0 to 60 takes just 2.8 seconds.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,280
理论极速每小时170英里
And in theory, the top speed is 170.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
但是也许在实际中我们做不到
But in reality, it isn't,

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,040
因为它和Ariel原子有相同的问题
because the Mono has the same
problem as the Ariel Atom.

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,920
没有挡风玻璃
No windscreen.

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,640
70英里的时候 你的脸开始移位了
At 70 miles an hour,
your face starts to move about.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,080
80英里每小时 肉就快吹掉了
And then when you get to 80,
it starts to come off.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,320
90英里每小时 你要接受现实 去弄个头盔
'At 90, you're forced to accept
that really, you need a helmet.

50
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,080
戴上头盔 你要感谢
'With a lid on,
you can start to appreciate

51
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,040
这车是多么的聪明
'just how clever this car is.'

52
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,040
首先要说的 很舒适 没别的意思 真的是很舒服
First of all, I fit. I mean,
only just, but I do actually fit.

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,920
尽管它装配的是
And even though it has

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
类似于F1的推杆悬挂
Formula One-style
pushrod suspension,

55
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,280
驾乘感受却独树一帜 你可以称之为享受
the ride is sublime. You could
almost call it comfortable.

56
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,520
虽然 有人说 高转速时
Although, that said, at high revs,

57
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,760
整车会抖动并呜呜作响
everything starts to tingle
and vibrate.

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,040
但我不想详细解释 简单打个比方吧
I don't want to go into too many
details, but let me put it this way.

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,360
如果我是个女孩子 我会非常喜欢这车
If I were a girl,
I'd like it very much.

60
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,280
奇怪的是 纵使对眼子老太婆
Strangely, even cross-eyed women

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,320
都能开着它合法上路
can drive this car legally
on the road.

62
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,640
但它实际上是为赛道而生的
But realistically,
it's built for the track.

63
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,200
所以 我们就看看究竟如何
So, let's see what's what.

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,480
这和直线速度没什么关系
It's not really about
straight-line speed.

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,800
也不曾感觉有多快
It doesn't actually feel that fast.

66
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,040
当你习惯它时 其实也不觉得可怕
And when you get used to it,
it's not that scary, either.

67
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,920
诚实的说 我不像是在驾驶汽车
If I'm honest,
it's not really like driving, this.

68
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,520
更像是在指挥一支
It's like conducting an orchestra

69
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,040
训练有素的管弦乐队
of parts that know exactly
what they're doing.

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,320
他们都已经排练得很出色了
They're very well rehearsed.

71
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,920
那里圆号 这里小提琴
There goes the French horns,
and here are the violins.

72
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,840
刹车妙不可言 变速箱更是美轮美奂
The brakes, they're good.
Gearbox is fantastic.

73
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,840
它在不停地换挡 嗙 嗙 嗙
It really is an absolutely instant
change. Bang, bang, bang, ready.

74
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,660
不止这些
'And there's more.'

75
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,080
因为这些沉重的部件 发动机
Because all the heavy stuff,
the engine,

76
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,680
变速箱还有驾驶者 都在一条线上
the gearbox and the driver,
is all in a line,

77
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,640
低沉在车的正中间
low down in the middle of the car,

78
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,200
车的重心位置和蠕虫一样
it has the same centre of gravity
as a worm.

79
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,200
F1悬挂和定制轮胎 青梅竹马
Couple that to the F1 suspension
and the specially-made tyres,

80
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,840
过弯速度简直大到正无穷
and the cornering speeds
are simply immense.

81
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,680
为了展示如何的大
To demonstrate how immense,

82
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,080
我们在极速弯放置一个雷达测速装置
we've set up a radar trap
on the follow-through,

83
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,840
开标致208 以最快速度通过
and coming through it now, as fast
as possible, is a Peugeot 208.

84
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,960
每小时83.5英里
83.5 miles an hour.

85
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,000
接下来轮到宝马M3
'Then it was the turn of a BMW M3.'

86
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,800
喔 看一下 每小时90.25英里
Ooh, now, look at that.
90.25 miles an hour.

87
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,600
在尼桑GT-R小试身手后 我们放出了Mono
'After a Nissan GT-R had a go,
we unleashed the Mono.'

88
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,680
明白我的意思了吗
See my point?

89
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
它跑得很快 也很有驾驶乐趣
It is very fast, then, and it's fun.

90
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,240
但是可靠性怎么样呢
But what about reliability,

91
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,360
对于一辆小排量的英国小跑车
traditionally not a strong point

92
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,840
这在过去并不是重点
for small-volume British sports cars?

93
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,120
我第一次开Mono时 它自燃了
The first time I drove a Mono,
it set fire to itself.

94
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,040
第二次 引擎又坏了
The second time,
the engine went wonky,

95
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,120
第三次时 还没出厂就坏了
and the third time, it broke down
before it had even left the factory.

96
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,560
所以我想了想 这果然又是一辆典型的英国货
So I thought of it, really,
as another typically British,

97
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,040
搞砸了的好点子
badly-executed good idea.

98
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,840
虽然这么说
But since all those calamities,

99
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,920
但他们毕竟花了12个月设计制造并做细节处理
they've had 12 months to work
on the design and the detailing,

100
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,440
我不得不说 虽然它看上去不算成熟
and I have to say, it looks
not just very well thought out,

101
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,240
但绝对算得上制作精良
but absolutely beautifully made.

102
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,880
也不仅仅是细节让人惊叹
And it's not just the detailing
that's beautiful, either.

103
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,720
而是 当你向后站一步
When you stand back,

104
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,560
你会发现 这是我见过的 最让人激动的外形之一
that's one of the most exciting
shapes I've ever seen.

105
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Mono是除了奶酪以外 柴郡最好的产品
The Mono is the nicest thing to come
out of Cheshire since the cheese.

106
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,120
但10万2千英镑的价格
But it does cost £102,000, and that,

107
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,400
对于一辆一年用两次的玩具来说 似乎多了点
for a twice-a-year toy, is a lot.

108
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,560
但从很多方面来讲 它有点像iPad
In many ways, then,
this is a bit like an iPad,

109
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,400
因为iPad也不便宜 你肯定也不一定需要
because that's not cheap either,
and you certainly don't need one.

110
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,840
但你就是想买一部
But you want one,

111
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,480
因为它实在令人爱不释手
because it's such a lovely...thing.

112
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,320
这车 这车真是极好的 我懂
It is. It's gorgeous. I know.

113
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,280
制作精良 如同珠宝一般
And beautifully made.
It's a piece of jewellery.

114
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,800
但是
But...

115
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,320
-什么 -10万2钱英镑
What? £102,000?

116
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,920
我知道 有点贵
I know, it is expensive,

117
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,720
尤其是当你知道
especially when you bear in mind

118
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,280
其它所有你能买的优秀的赛道日赛车 都要便宜很多
all the other brilliant track-day
cars you can buy for a lot less,

119
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,000
KTM Radical Ariel原子
the KTM, Radical, Ariel Atom.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,040
-还有摩根3轮车 -不算 我说了优秀的
Morgan 3 Wheeler.
No, I said brilliant.

121
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
好吧 卡特汉姆R500
All right, the Caterham R500.

122
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,760
那是很棒的一款赛道日赛车 价格只有这辆的一半
That's a brilliant track-day car,
and that's half the price of this.

123
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,760
是的 而且那车很快的 这辆车会更快吗？
Yes, and that is enormously fast.
But will this be faster?

124
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,920
为了找到答案 我们要把车交给我们的圈养车手
To find out, we shall hand it over
to our tame racing driver.

125
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,280
有人说 他半夜闯入人们的家里
Some say that he breaks
into people's houses at night

126
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,280
并在厨房抽屉里 留下两把神秘的钥匙
and leaves two mysterious extra keys
in a kitchen drawer...

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,160
而由于他买了倍耐力牌的避孕套
And that as a result of buying
Pirelli condoms this week,

128
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,840
他现在已有17个孩子
he now has 17 children.

129
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,600
我们只知道 他叫Stig
All we know is,
he's called The Stig!

130
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Stig蓄势待发 他出发了
Stig snaps to attention,
and he's off,

131
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,520
如跳蚤般弹射起步
flicking off the line like a flea,

132
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,800
尽管起始点是潮湿的
even though the start-finish line
was damp.

133
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,760
希望赛道的其他部分都是干的
Hopefully,
the rest of the track's dry.

134
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,440
飞快切入第一个弯 方向打得很急
Flying into the first corner,
he came in very hot there,

135
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,400
但可以摆平 完全没问题
but sorted it out.
No problem at all.

136
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,960
没有音响 当然了
No stereo, of course,

137
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,280
只有考斯沃斯调试过的引擎声
just the sound of that
Cosworth-tuned engine

138
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,960
他呼啸着过芝加哥弯 非常稳定 坚如磬石
as he zips round Chicago
absolutely rock-solid.

139
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,040
现在 锤头弯
Now, Hammerhead.

140
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,120
能不能展示出中置引擎的平衡性呢？
What will this reveal about
the mid-engine balance?

141
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,200
干净利落 牢牢抓住地面
No drama.That is properly nailed down.

142
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,440
看啊 一个优雅和谐的漂移
But look, a well-orchestrated drift
on the way out!

143
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,720
高转速带来的振动让Stig大湿一片
High revs now. The vibrations will
be stimulating his lady parts.

144
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,920
极速弯 对啊 他加了档位
Follow-through and yes, he actually
changed up through there.

145
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,120
Stig很勇敢 即使大难临头
Stig is brave,
even on the brink of a crisis.

146
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,720
精准的操控来到倒数第二弯
Controlling it beautifully
into the second-to-last corner.

147
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,360
呼啸着进入甘邦弯 赛级变速箱低声哀鸣
Screams up to Gambon,
racing gearbox whining.

148
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,400
侧滑出弯 冲线了
Slides it through,
and across the line.

149
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,760
好了 这里是卡特汉姆R500
Now...here we have
the Caterham R500,

150
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,360
圈速是1分17.9秒
which did it in 1.17.9, yeah?

151
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,280
BAC Mono...

152
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,840
1分14.3秒
1.14.3.

153
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
不是吧！
No way!

154
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,640
哇！我们这里第二快的车！
Wow! The second-fastest car
we've ever had!

155
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,360
真了不起
That is something else.

156
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,240
太棒了 好极了
Tremendous. Excellent.

157
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,160
现在 到了新闻时间
And now,
now it is time for the news,

158
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,360
好消息！
and it's good news,

159
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,320
达契亚“抹布”今年
because the Dacia Duster has been named

160
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,520
被提名为年度廉价四驱拖车
budget 4x4 tow car of the year.

161
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,360
-很好 好了 我买了一辆自行车 -我觉得你看上去变苗条了
Great. Now, I've bought a bicycle. I thought you were looking a bit trim.

162
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,400
好吧 你知道 不是我变瘦了
Well, do you know, it's not really
the weight that I've lost,

163
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,720
-而是我的核心 怎么说的？-核心肌群
but my core, what's it called?
Core strength.

164
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,480
我们这是《大话女人》节目还是什么？
Are we on Loose Women or something?

165
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,040
不 詹姆斯 你很清楚
No, James, as you well know,

166
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,680
我们在“最后的夏天档”多年了
we have for many years been
on Last of The Summer Gear.

167
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,720
自从我买了自行车后 让我快要疯掉的是
Since I bought my bicycle,
what's driving me mad

168
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,880
很多人来告诉我你要买一条弹力短裤
is the amount of people
who come and say
"You need to get lycra shorts now".

169
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,640
对啊 你要 因为那更舒服并且减少摩擦
Well, you do, because it's more
comfortable and it stops chafing.

170
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,240
不 哈蒙德 不需要
No, Hammond, you don't.

171
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,120
穿弹力裤的人们常说
People who wear lycra shorts go,

172
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,840
看啊 这又难又危险 我要特殊（保护） 你不要
"Look, it's difficult and dangerous,
and I need special..." You don't.

173
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,360
事实上 唯一我需要做出让步的是
In fact, the only thing I do wear
as a concession that I make

174
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,040
穿一件这样的T-恤
is this T-shirt, OK? This is

175
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,120
这是我独自骑车时穿的衣服的背面
the back of it as I'm riding along.

176
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,840
机动车驾驶员们 谢谢你们让我用你的路
"Motorists, thank you for letting me
use your roads."

177
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,920
LAUGHTER

178
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,520
因为我觉得这样才有礼貌
Because I think that's polite.

179
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,720
我不相信你竟然真的骑自行车 什么样的自行车？
I don't believe you have a bicycle.
What kind of bicycle is it?

180
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,560
不知道 就普通的
I don't know, they're all the same.

181
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,840
山地车？公路赛车？
Is it a mountain bike,
is it a racer?

182
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,000
当你去商店 你穿过门
When you went to the shop,
you walked through

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,680
走进自行车店 店员就会说：“天啊。”
the door of a bicycle shop
and the man went, "Oh, my God".

184
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,360
你说：“我想要。。。”
And you went "I'd like..."?

185
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,600
我只说了我能买一辆门口那款车吗？
I just said, "Can I have the one
nearest to the door?"

186
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,520
他本想说 你可以买一辆这款 1万英镑 或这辆
He was trying to say, "You can
have this one for £10,000, or this..."

187
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,000
我说 不 我只想要一辆自行车 500英镑
I said "No, I just want a bicycle."
500 quid.

188
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,280
他卖你的这辆车
This bicycle he sold you,

189
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,360
-是不是前轮比后轮要大很多的那种？-不是
is the front wheel a lot bigger
than the back wheel? No.

190
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,920
就是一辆普通的自行车 轮子一样大
It's just a bike. They're all the same.

191
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,600
后轮有没有两个小轮子？
Has it got two little ones
at the back?

192
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,880
没有 没有平衡辅助轮
No, it hasn't got stabilisers.

193
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,800
我不相信 我觉得这是一个新的谜团
I don't believe you, and I think
this has become a new mystery.

194
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,040
就像野人一样
It's like a yeti.

195
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,440
所以如果有人看见他
So if maybe somebody's seen him,

196
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
如果你看见杰里米在骑车 请写信给我们
if you have seen Jeremy
on his bicycle, write to us, please,

197
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,720
写“救命 我快笑死了” Top Gear 伍德兰 等等
at "Help, I've Burst From Laughing",
Top Gear, Wood Lane, wherever.

198
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,280
不敢相信
I don't believe you.

199
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,800
我要骑车。。。 不 我下周不能骑车来
I'm going to ride... No, I'm not
going to ride down here next week.

200
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,040
太2B了 我都不经常骑车去报刊亭的
That's idiotic.
I barely ride to the paper shop.

201
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,480
上周末谁看了F1英国站?
Now, who saw the British Grand Prix
last weekend?

202
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
观众：看了!
AUDIENCE: Yes!

203
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,880
你们可能已经发现比赛里有很多次爆胎
You may have noticed there were
a lot of blowouts, OK,

204
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,240
我必须得说我很同情倍耐力
and I must say,
I feel rather sorry for Pirelli.

205
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,360
最近几年
For the last few years,

206
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,320
他家的轮胎真的很好 抓地力好又耐用
their tyres have been really good
and grippy and lasted too long,

207
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,960
所以F1组织方跟倍耐力说
so the organisers said to Pirelli,

208
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,160
"你们能造一款比较垃圾的轮胎吗?"
"Can you design a tyre
that's a bit rubbish?"

209
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,120
他们就造了 于是现在所有人都在抱怨
So they did,
and now everyone's saying,

210
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,560
"你们造的轮胎真是垃圾"
"Your tyres are a bit rubbish".

211
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,880
怎样的垃圾轮胎才能称得上非常垃圾呢?
So how rubbish is too rubbish?

212
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,520
你觉得倍耐力研发这轮胎的时候花了多少经费
How much do you think Pirelli spent
developing those tyres?

213
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,160
这怎么也得…也要一百块吧?
It's got to be...100 quid?

214
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,040
这肯定得要上百万啊
It's going to be millions.

215
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,840
好 花了上百万英镑 开发一种轮胎
Yeah, millions of pounds
developing a tyre,

216
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,680
而市场反响是 人们到轮胎店换轮胎时
and all they get in response is
people going into tyre warehouses

217
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,680
会说 "我的车要换四条新轮胎 只要不是倍耐力的就行"
and saying "I need four new tyres
for my car, just not Pirellis".

218
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,040
对 我还在介绍STIG出场的时候说他们笑话
Right. And then I make silly jokes
when introducing the Stig about it.

219
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
他们真是事与愿违了
It's gone wrong! It backfired.

220
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,320
这就是我不理解F1的地方
This is exactly why
I don't get Formula One,

221
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,960
因为它本应就该在汽车科技的最前沿
because surely it should be the
pinnacle of automotive technology.

222
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,320
倍耐力应该竭尽全力地
Pirelli should make a tyre

223
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,280
造一款最好的轮胎
as good as it is possible
to make a tyre.

224
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,240
它应该有主动空气动力的设计
They should have
active aerodynamics,

225
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,720
它应该拥有世上最尖端的牵引力控制系统
they should have traction control,
the most sophisticated in the world,

226
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,520
防抱死系统 隐身斗篷 这类东西
ABS, invisibility cloaks, all that.

227
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,960
应该允许他们在轮胎上用任何他们想用的技术
They should be allowed to have
anything they want.

228
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,640
但问题是 比赛组织方想把F1变成
The problem is, the organisers
are trying to make Formula One

229
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,760
更能凸显车手能力的公平比赛平台 往往事与愿违
a level playing field to make it a
drivers' championship. And it isn't.

230
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,720
你把维特尔放到Marussia车队里
You could put Sebastian Vettel
in a Marussia

231
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,520
他也只能垫底 -正是这样
and he's going to come last.
Exactly.

232
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,560
我们应该把F1变成车厂间的较量
Let's just make it
a championship for car-makers,

233
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,720
任凭设计师们天马行空
and then let the designers
have completely free rein.

234
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,920
你知道我会怎么做
You know what I'd do?

235
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,160
我会做一辆跟赛道一样宽的赛车
I'd make a car that was the exact
width of the track.

236
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,640
LAUGHTER

237
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,400
这得多有才啊? -这有意思
How clever's that?
That's interesting.

238
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,560
但这只有在你排位赛成绩靠前时才用得上啊
That would only work
if you qualified at the front.

239
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,760
不 不必这样
No, you wouldn't have to,

240
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,000
因为这车会和TOP FUEL赛车一样
(Top Fuel 北美NHRA赛规下专用做直线竞速的赛车 燃料为硝基甲烷与甲醇混合物 0.7秒即可达到100英里时速)
because it would be a Top Fuel-type
dragster, OK?

241
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,800
弯道时候会非常糟糕
So it'd be very poor
around the corners

242
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,080
所以排位赛肯定垫底
and I'd qualify last,

243
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,120
但起步时候我可以在到达第一个弯道之前
but I would accelerate really
quickly past them all

244
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,120
超过所有的对手 然后让它展开
before the first corner,
and then it would expand.

245
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,400
啊它自己会展开啊
-我这样就能赢了啊
Oh, it grows.
I've just won the championship.

246
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,200
Jeremy 你说的这是Wacky Races
(Wacky Races 美国卡通频道赛车主题动画片)
Jeremy, what you're proposing
is Wacky Races.

247
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,560
我知道! 想象一下 你可以
I know! Just think,
you could have, like,

248
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,760
让狗狗当你的副驾 它在你边上
(模仿Muttley Laugh 该动画片中狗狗角色)
a dog as your co-driver that goes...
IMITATES MUTTLEY LAUGH

249
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,880
我要我的车前面有个巨型圆锯
I want a giant circular saw
on the front of my car.

250
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,480
但这是机智的设定 我每圈只能用它一次
But here's the clever thing.
I can only use it once a lap.

251
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,680
所以你有DRS区域 圆锯区域 这真是个好主意
(DRS区域 F1中允许使用可变尾翼的赛道区域）
So you've got DRS zone,
then the saw zone. It's a good idea.

252
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,360
我要把我的F1赛车装上时间穿越装置 你想啊
I'd fit my Formula One car
with time travel. Think about it.

253
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,600
比赛解说说道 "比赛开始了!James已经赢了"
The commentator would go "And
they're off! And James had won."

254
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,720
真机智! -我们解决了F1的问题
That's clever.
We've solved Formula One.

255
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,320
再次证明了 这个世界没我们不行啊
Again, the world just doesn't work
without us in it. No.

256
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,520
沃尔沃的新闻! -好耶
-他们发布了一款能自己停车的车
Volvo News! Hooray. They have
launched a car which parks itself.

257
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,760
而且是在你不在车里的情况下
And I don't mean you sit in it.

258
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,440
沃尔沃的主意是 你在办公楼门口停车 下车
The idea is, you pull up
outside your office, get out,

259
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,760
进你的办公室
go into your office.

260
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:01,240
车子自己会开走 找个停车位 我不是瞎编的
然后它自己停车入库
It goes off, finds a space, I'm not
making this up, and parks in it.

261
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,400
唯一的问题是 当你从办公室里出来
The only problem is,
when you come out of your office,

262
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,280
你怎么知道它停哪了啊?
how do you know where it's parked?

263
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,840
要是它停在了三条街远的地方呢?
But what if it had to park
three streets away?

264
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,120
或者它放弃找停车位直接回家了呢?
Or what if it's just given up
and gone home?

265
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,440
等等 它怎么知道停车位的规则
Hang on,
how does it know what the rules are?

266
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,880
那些停车位标志还有单黄线
You know those signs that go
with single yellow lines

267
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,200
还有那些在马路边划了两条线的车位
and those ones where there
are two lines on the kerb?

268
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,240
这相当复杂 而且这是瑞典的 瑞典人本来就搞不懂这一套
They're complicated. And it's
Swedish anyway, so it can't read it.

269
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,760
我最大的担心是
What worries me about this is,

270
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,360
路上以后会开满了没有司机的 有点犹犹豫豫的沃尔沃
the roads will be full of driverless,
slightly panicky Volvos

271
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,600
匆匆忙忙地开来开去
scurrying about going,

272
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,160
"我能停这吗?我能停那吗?我能去哪停啊?"
"Can I park here? Can I park there?
Where can I go?"

273
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,760
这会相当恐怖啊 -路灯杆才是问题
-为啥
It's going to be terrifying.
It's the lampposts. What?

274
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,120
所有的路灯杆上都会贴着"寻沃启示"
All the lampposts will have missing
Volvo pictures on. Aww.

275
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,520
"他只有一岁大 他的名字叫小蹄蹄
"He's only a year old
and he's called Tiddles

276
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,280
"他出去找停车位然后我就找不到他了"
"and he went off to find a parking
space and I haven't seen him since!"

277
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,680
不管怎样 我们继续
Anyway, let's move on.

278
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,880
最近接连发布了很多辆超跑
There has been a whole rash of new
supercars launched recently.

279
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,680
这是我感兴趣的一辆 法拉利
This is the one I'm interested in,
this Ferrari. Ooh.

280
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,760
确实很赞 V12发动机 800匹马力
Indeed, ooh.
It has an 800 horsepower V12.

281
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,520
而且它还有一套跟F1赛车上类似的KERS系统
It has a KERS system
like a Formula One car.

282
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,760
售价大约在一百万英镑左右
It's going to cost around a
million quid,

283
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,360
但我觉得它的名字起得有点问题
but I think they've got a bit
of a problem with the name,

284
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,000
法拉利管它叫"LaFerrari"
because they've called it
LaFerrari.

285
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,200
不好意思 这有何不妥 是叫这个名字啊
Sorry, what's wrong with that?
I mean, it is.

286
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,840
不 这是它的型号名
No, but that's the model name.

287
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,520
LaFerrari在意大利文的意思就是"法拉利"
所以这辆车就是法拉利-法拉利
(意大利文的La类似英语的the)
LaFerrari means "the Ferrari",
so that's the Ferrari the Ferrari.

288
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,440
啊对 我特别想要的超跑是帕加尼
Oh, yeah. The supercar
I really want is by Pagani.

289
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,280
他们有辆新车出来了 但又不完全是新车
They've got a new car out,
except they sort of haven't,

290
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,880
因为这是Zonda的另一个版本
because it's yet another version

291
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,840
老车型了 就是它
of the Zonda, their old car.
There it is.

292
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,920
-有什么新变化?
-除了价格 还真没啥变化
And what's new about that? Not
a lot, really, apart from the price.

293
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,040
这车售价是230万英镑
-什么! 这二手车要这么贵?
It's now £2.3 million. What?
Yeah. For a second-hand car?

294
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,720
没错
Yeah.

295
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,960
你们知道吗 我最心仪的一款车
You know, the one
I'm most interested in,

296
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,240
是迈凯轮P1 因为它售价一百万英镑不到
this is the McLaren P1, because this
is just shy of a million quid,

297
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,800
所以简直是特价 而且它有903匹马力 903匹!
so it's almost a bargain. And it's
got a 903 horsepower engine. 903.

298
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,400
让我觉得最不可思议的是
What fascinates me is,

299
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,480
它后面可以有个可升降的尾翼
there's a wing that comes out
of the back of it

300
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,280
尾翼上带DRS系统
which has got DRS on it.

301
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,040
众所周知 DRS系统 F1里用的 可变下压力系统
You know what DRS is, with the...
In Formula One, it opens.

302
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,360
如果你有903匹马力 你什么时候会想到
If you've got 903 horsepower,
when would you ever think,

303
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,800
"好 我要更快的直线速度
"Right, I need more straight-line
speed.

304
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,600
"我要开启DRS系统"?
"I'll deploy the DRS wing"?

305
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,800
好吧 这还是可能会发生的
Well, it could happen.

306
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,920
"那辆快递货车开得真快 看来我得开启DRS了"
"That post office van is getting
a shift on. I'll deploy DRS."

307
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,760
不不不不 你需要这个 你的DRS
No, you will need that, your DRS,

308
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,240
特别当你碰到在法拉利-法拉利里的我的时候
when you come across me
in the Ferrari the Ferrari,

309
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,320
因为 我刚刚没有说清楚
because, I hadn't read this
properly,

310
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,280
它确实有800匹马力 但是
it has got 800 horsepower
in the engine, but of course,

311
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,560
他有KERS系统
it's got a KERS system.

312
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,280
当你启用KERS系统用电机一起发力时
When you deploy it
and use the electric bit as well,

313
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,080
嗯哼 就变成963匹了
ahem, 963 horsepower.

314
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,680
而且所有这些动力都只传递到后轮?
-是的 没错
And is that all going through
the rear wheels? Yes, it is.

315
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,960
等下 这马力数据
Hang on, that's broadly
the same amount of power

316
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,080
和布加迪威龙已经不相上下了
you get from a Bugatti,

317
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,480
但威龙车身要比法拉利-法拉利重了一倍
which is almost exactly
twice as heavy

318
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,000
而且还有四驱系统
as the Ferrari the Ferrari,
and it has four-wheel-drive.

319
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,040
这货 才叫神作
-没错
That's going to be "an handful".
Yes.

320
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,880
让人激动啊 我真想去体验一下
-我很想开开这迈凯轮
Exciting, though. I want a go in it.
I really want to go in the McLaren.

321
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,080
这会是个很壮观的测试
That would be an epic test.

322
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,520
你开着那辆法拉利 你迈凯轮 我开着Zonda
You in that Ferrari, you in
the McLaren, me in that Zonda.

323
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,640
有人愿意看这个吗?
Anybody want to see that?

324
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,280
观众: 愿意!
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

325
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,560
我也想 我们努力一下看看这事能不能成真
So do I. Let's see
if we can put that together.

326
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,160
但你也知道 人们通常找到我们 然后说
But you know how people often come
up to us and say,

327
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,920
"Top Gear什么时候才会完结"
"When will Top Gear end?"

328
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,880
我们开着这些车起步后大概三分钟
About three minutes after us three
have set off.

329
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,400
恩 在一个大火球里结束
Yeah, in a big fireball.

330
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,280
有人愿意看这个吗?
Does anybody want to see THAT?

331
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,560
观众: 愿意!
AUDIENCE: Yes!

332
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,280
好吧 我们继续 我们这个节目已经播了11年了
Right, let's move on, because it is
now 11 years we've been on air,

333
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,560
但我们惊奇的发现
and in all that time,

334
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,880
从一开始 我们就从没测评过这一辆车
there is one vehicle that we have
never reviewed, which is a surprise,

335
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,840
它是最受欢迎的车
because it's the most popular,

336
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,560
最重要的车 也是世界上使用最频繁的车
important and used vehicle
in the world.

337
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,160
我说的 当然是出租车
I'm talking, of course,
about the taxi,

338
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,200
不管你到哪 出租车可谓人类运转的源泉
the lifeblood of people movement
wherever you go in the world.

339
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,400
英国对此的贡献无需多言
And Britain's contribution to
this effort needs no introduction.

340
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,120
它是任何伦敦街景中的标志
It's a staple
of any London street scene.

341
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,120
现在大约有1万9千辆黑色出租车
There are currently
around 19,000 black cabs

342
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,200
在伦敦街头接送着人们
moving people across the capital,

343
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,640
这一大群的出租车每年行驶大约5亿英里的路程
and this vast fleet covers
almost half a billion miles a year.

344
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,880
那边还有一辆 他们真的是无处不在
There's another.
They are literally everywhere.

345
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,800
因为伦敦特殊的生活节奏
London life has caused the black cab

346
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,760
黑色出租车进化成了让人惊叹的高效运载工具
to evolve into
an amazingly efficient vehicle.

347
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,800
比方说 它著名的极小的转弯半径
Its famous tiny turning circle,
for example,

348
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,720
就是专为萨沃伊酒店门口的小环岛而设计的
(Savoy 伦敦最著名豪华酒店之一)
is the result of the need to tackle
the roundabout outside the Savoy.

349
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
还有就是出租车司机
Then there's the black cab driver.

350
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,000
世上没有其他的出租车司机需要像他们一样
No cabbie in the world
has to go through

351
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,960
通过名为"知识"的恐怖试炼
an ordeal as fearsome
as The Knowledge,

352
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:44,600
所有的伦敦出租车司机都要认得2万5千条路
which requires that all London
taxi drivers memorise 25,000 streets.

353
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,080
这个测试非常严格 事实上
The test is so tough, in fact,

354
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,360
所有的伦敦出租车司机都进化出了非常肥大的海马回突
that cabbies develop an extra large
hippocampus,

355
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,640
这是大脑中负责记忆 导航
which is the area of the brain
associated with memory, navigation

356
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,400
和对移民观点的部分
and views on immigration.

357
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,360
人车结合
Put this combination of man
and machine together,

358
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,760
结果那当然是毋庸置疑
and what you have is indisputable.

359
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,440
毫无疑问 无比明显 无可非议的
What you have is, without doubt,
obviously, unquestionably,

360
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,400
世上最好的出租车
no arguments,
the best taxi in the world.

361
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,080
真是这样吗？
Or is it?

362
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,200
纽约的出租车司机
The thing is, a New York taxi driver

363
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,480
对此说法很可能会不同意吧
would probably disagree
with that statement.

364
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,680
他会说"是啊 你们车的后排空间确实更大
He'd say "Yeah, you may have
more space in the back,

365
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,360
"但是你们伦敦出租车又慢又不舒服
"but your London taxi is slow
and the ride is terrible,

366
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,440
"我的黄色出租车有个大大的V8发动机 还有更好的悬挂"
"whereas my yellow taxi has
a big V8 and proper suspension."

367
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,560
但德里的出租车司机会说
But then a cabbie in Delhi would
say,

368
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,000
"我的印度出租车更经久耐用"
"My Indian taxi is built
to last longer".

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,200
总体上来说 世界上任何地方的出租车司机
Basically, every cabbie
everywhere in the world

370
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,440
都会抓住一个理由 说自己的出租车是世上最棒的
could argue for one reason or another
that their taxi is the best.

371
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,000
也就是说 如果他们真想知道
Which means, if we really want
to find out

372
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
哪个是世界上最棒的出租车
which is the greatest taxi
in the world,

373
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,400
只有一个方法才能评判
there is only one way to do it,

374
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,680
这就一如往常 要做到真金不怕火炼
and that is, as ever,
in the prism of the furnace

375
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,480
只有通过赛车的历练
through the looking glass
of the crucible of motorsport.

376
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,560
这就是我们全球大决战的地点
That means a race, and the venue
for our global showdown

377
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,880
是肯特郡的林登山
will be Lydden Hill in Kent,

378
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,280
在世界赛车界以唯一拥有自己的出租车办公室
famous throughout the motorsport
world

379
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,680
而久负盛名
for being the only race track
with its own cab office.

380
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,080
这个胶板搭的出租车办公室看上去离赛道也太近了点
That plywood cab office looks
perilously close to the track.

381
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,920
我真心希望它不会受到啥伤害
I sincerely hope no harm befalls it.

382
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,280
不管怎样
来看看我们这次出租车全球大决战的参赛车辆吧
Anyway, let's now meet our grid
of taxis from around the world.

383
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,320
代表大不列颠帝国 我们有1997年的Fairway
Representing Great Britain,
we have a 1997 Fairway driver which,

384
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,920
里程表上只有32万英里 新得像还没出磨合期一样
with a mere 320,000 miles
on the clock, is barely run in.

385
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,480
代表墨西哥 1970年大众甲壳虫
From Mexico,
a 1970 Volkswagen Beetle.

386
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,320
单单在墨西哥城 就有5万辆这样的车在努力营生
50,000 of these things ply
their trade in Mexico City alone.

387
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,480
代表美国 出租车世界中的泰坦
From America,
one of the titans of the taxi world,

388
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,000
纽约黄色出租车
a New York yellow cab.

389
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,080
福特皇冠维多利亚 后轮驱动
This particular one is a Ford Crown
Victoria, rear-wheel drive,

390
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,640
4.6升V8 想当年 开到130英里时速完全没问题
4.6 litre V8
and in its day, good for 130.

391
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,320
这是我们需要担心的对手
That's one to worry about.

392
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:22,040
代表印度 印度斯坦牌大使 在我们这可算是老家伙了
From India, the Hindustan Ambassador,
very much the old-timer here.

393
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,520
大使曾是印度最受欢迎的出租车
The Ambassador has been
India's favourite taxi

394
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,560
达55年之久
for an incredible 55 years.

395
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,240
接下来 来自南非 我们有这辆丰田海狮
Next, from South Africa,
we have this. A Toyota HiAce.

396
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,920
在大多数别的国家里
Whereas in most countries,

397
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,480
这是出租车的应急救援车
they will be rooting
for their local taxi,

398
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,440
你就知道南非人对此不屑一顾了
you can expect the South Africans
to be booing,

399
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,240
这些车因为他们野性狂暴 被人又恨又怕
because these things are hated and
feared for their wild aggression.

400
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,760
接下来是这个 代表德国 奔驰E系
Moving on to this, from Germany.
It's the Mercedes E-Class.

401
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,400
干净 智能 保养得天衣无缝
Neat, smart
and fastidiously maintained.

402
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,960
最后 代表俄罗斯 加长林肯
And finally, from Russia,
a Stretched Lincoln Town Car.

403
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,480
恩 它看上去不太像是辆出租车 可它真的是
Now, that might not look like a cab,
but it is.

404
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,840
在俄罗斯 有钱的大佬们用这种加长车做出租车跑来跑去
In Russia, rich oligarchs hail limos
just like this to get around.

405
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,560
所以 当你以为我们叫来一辆强劲有力 后轮驱动的
So if you think we've included
a powerful rear-wheel drive

406
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,240
长超9米的车只是为了来添乱的话
30-foot long car just in the hope
that it will cause chaos,

407
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,960
你可千万别这样想了
get that thought out of your head.

408
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,520
所以 这就是了 世上最具代表性的出租车们
So there we are, then -
the world's most iconic taxis,

409
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,400
泰然自若 准备为自己的国家争光添彩
each poised and ready to defend
the honour of its country.

410
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,840
好 出租车司机们
Now, the cab drivers.

411
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,560
自然的 因为我们这的比赛是如此重要
And naturally, because of the
magnitude of what's at stake here,

412
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,040
每个国家都派出了国内最顶尖的出租车司机
each country has sent its very best.

413
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,240
但他们肯定都会迷路或者别的啥了 所以 为了代替他们
But they all must have got lost
or something, so instead,

414
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,560
我们有这一帮不上台面的赛车手
we have the usual ragtag bunch
of racing drivers.

415
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,960
代表俄罗斯 房车比赛传奇 Anthony Reid
For Russia,
touring car legend Anthony Reid.

416
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,880
代表南非 房车比赛传奇 Matt Jackson
For South Africa,
touring car legend Matt Jackson.

417
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
代表德国 房车比赛传奇 Matt Neal
For Germany,
touring car legend Matt Neal.

418
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,120
代表印度 房车比赛传奇 Gordon Shedden
For India,
touring car legend Gordon Shedden.

419
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,800
代表墨西哥 房车比赛传奇 Paul O'Neill
For Mexico,
touring car legend Paul O'Neill.

420
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:20,400
代表美国 房车比赛传奇 Tom Chilton
For America, touring car legend
Tom Chilton.

421
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,240
然后就是在黑色出租车里的 我!
And in the black cab, me.

422
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,440
我们准备就绪 再次向基于赛车运动的科学研究的深渊中
So here we are, ready to plunge
once more into the abyss

423
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,800
勇猛前行
of motorsport-based
scientific research.

424
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,200
我想要指出 在仪表盘上供着自己信仰的神
I should point out that it's
the custom for Indian taxi drivers

425
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,600
是印度出租车司机的传统习惯
to carry a figurine of their chosen
God on the dashboard of their car.

426
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,760
我觉得我们的人做得稍微有点过了
I think our guy may have
overdone it a bit.

427
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
ENGINES REV, HORNS BEEP

428
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,080
这群家伙们有点不耐心了 不错不错
倒数5秒
The guys are getting impatient.
That's good. Five-second board.

429
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,080
出发咯!
Yeah!

430
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,640
南非飞驰而过
The South African is through.

431
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,240
纽约出租车在边上 德国 所有人都超过我了
New York taxi alongside,
German...everybody is through.

432
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,960
所有人 都超过我了
Absolutely everybody has passed me.

433
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,000
但这是马拉松 不是短跑
But this is a marathon,
not a sprint.

434
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,920
同往常一样 我严格规定了
'As ever, I'd issued strict
instructions

435
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,640
车与车之间严禁身体接触
'for the drivers to avoid
body contact.

436
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,400
很明显 南非选手没看到这一条通知
'Clearly, the South African
hadn't got the memo.'

437
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,120
南非选手完完全全疯了 根本失去了控制
The South African is completely
insane, largely out of control.

438
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,680
加长车的大漂移! 这可真牛逼
Huge slide from the limo!
That's incredible.

439
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,120
当俄罗斯加长车在弯道上奋斗的时候
'But while the Russian limo may have
been struggling in the corners,

440
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,600
我遇到了不少麻烦
'I had issues everywhere.'

441
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,520
恩 我爬坡时候被狠狠的甩下了
Yeah. I'm quite badly outpaced
on the hill,

442
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,520
直道时也是 转弯时也是
on the straights and in the turns.

443
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
这是我全部动力了
This is all I've got.

444
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,240
但是 我有个计划
'However, I had a plan.'

445
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,520
要说诡计多端 记住 伦敦出租车司机可是有"知识"的
When it comes to cunning, remember,
black cab drivers do The Knowledge.

446
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,880
我知道哪里能超近道 我悄悄地在这一拐
I know where all the shortcuts are.
I'll nip down here, love.

447
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,960
多亏我有超级小的转弯半径 我能搞定这个弯
Thanks to my super tight turning
circle, I can make this.

448
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,680
我又回到比赛中来了
That's me back in the race.

449
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,240
我敢说不只是回到比赛中
而且我还领先了
I'd say more than back in,
I am leading it.

450
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,280
只可惜我的出租车司机同行们对我这个策略不怎么欣赏
'Sadly, my fellow cabbies weren't
impressed by this tactic

451
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,360
所以当他们追上我时
'and when they caught up with me,

452
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,160
他们立刻就显示出了他们的不满
'they were quick to show
their displeasure.'

453
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,840
他就直接撞上来了 这真是 开玩笑吧
He's just ramming me! That is just...oh, you're joking.

454
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,080
来自其他国家的友善推搡
Yeah. Some good-natured jostling from the other nations.

455
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,680
赛程进行过半 局势尚不明朗
'With the race now at the halfway point, no clear leader was emerging,

456
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,760
也就意味着 车手们开始煽风点火了
'which meant inevitably that the drivers began to turn up the heat.'

457
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,600
那里撞了一下 不过我们没事
There's been a crash, but we're OK.

458
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,160
受够了南非的恶棍做派
'Fed up of the South African's hooliganism,

459
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,960
豪华轿车给了他一记自食苦果
'the limo gave him a taste of his own medicine.'

460
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,200
哦 哇 又被推挤了下
Oh! Whoa! Getting a push now.

461
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,160
这可是我的极速了
This is by far the fastest I have been.

462
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,600
老天 抱歉 哦 那是墨西哥车 是吧
Oh, Jesus. Sorry about that. Oh, God, it's the Mexican, isn't it?

463
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,960
后果严重
It's going to be bad.

464
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,600
还有两圈结束 大家仍然在冲刺 但这时
'With just two laps to go, everybody was still running. But then...'

465
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,240
豪华车自己出去了
Oh, the limo takes himself off entirely.

466
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,880
老天 俄罗斯车出局了
Oh, my word! That is Russia taken out.

467
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,160
事实上 美国车也自己出去了
In fact, America has taken itself out as well.

468
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,880
所以 在场上的 有甲壳虫
Right, still in play, we have the Beetle...

469
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,840
奔驰车表现不错
The Mercedes is holding up well.

470
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,400
很稳定 几乎没怎么受伤
It's really sustained very little damage.

471
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,320
但横行霸道的南非车似乎另有打算
'But the marauding South African had other ideas.'

472
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,480
哦 运气真差
Oh! Bad luck.

473
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,320
到了最后一圈
'Now into the final lap,

474
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,200
为了打败其他选手 我暗中走了另一条道
'and desperate to beat the remaining runners, I took another sneaky turn.'

475
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,840
哈哈
Ha-ha!

476
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,720
终点线在那儿
There is the finish line.

477
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
我觉得我赢定了
I think I can win this.

478
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,480
我觉得我能赢 哦 不 不
I think I can win... Oh, no, no!

479
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,160
我有点落后了
It's entirely possible that I am a bit last.

480
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,360
然而 赛车界的严酷考验
'Nevertheless, the crucible of motorsport

481
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,120
再一次给我们答案
'had once more given us the answer.

482
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,760
最终 世上最厉害的出租车是
'As it turns out, the greatest taxi in the world...

483
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,400
印度大使
'is the Hindustan Ambassador'.

484
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,040
干得好 伙计 棒极了
Well done, mate. Excellent.

485
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,480
很赞 合理论证
Excellent. Good science.

486
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,800
但容我问一句 Hammond 有个重要问题
But may I ask, Hammond, an important question?

487
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,040
你们做那段视频 死了多少人
How many people were killed in the making of that film?

488
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,920
-事实上 只有三人
-三人 看到没 比我预想的要多
Actually, only three. Three. See, that's more than I was hoping for.

489
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,680
但为了科学 总是要做点牺牲的
But with science, there often has to be sacrifice.

490
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,080
但在将这些车 经受赛车界严酷考验后
But you've decided, have you not, after subjecting those cars

491
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,640
你已经决定了 不是吗
to the white heat of the crucible of motorsport,

492
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,840
世上最好的出租车是
that the best taxi in the world

493
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,600
-从莫里斯牛津车发展而来 -就在我们的面前
-started out in life as a Morris Oxford. -Yeah, and there it is.

494
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,680
这就解释了为什么造伦敦黑色出租车的公司
That would explain why the company that makes the London black cab

495
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,440
-会破产  -你可以这么说 但他们回来了
-has gone bust. -You say that, but they're back.

496
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,040
他们得到救助 即将重新生产产品
They've been rescued. They're going to start production again very soon.

497
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,520
最终还是毫无意义
Pointlessly, as it turns out.

498
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,880
是的 没错
Yes, absolutely.

499
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,720
好 到了全新明星廉价车环节
So, let's put a star in our brand-new reasonably-priced car.

500
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,680
你们或许已经意识到 今年晚些时候
Now, you may be aware that later on this year,

501
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,720
我们将享受电影 急速风流的盛宴
we're going to be treated to a film called Rush.

502
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,840
讲述1976年 为夺得
It's about the epic battle in 1976

503
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,320
F1年度冠军的巅峰之战
for the Formula One world championship

504
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,680
James Hunt与Niki Lauda两人争锋相对
between James Hunt and Niki Lauda,

505
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,560
而我们今日的嘉宾就是电影导演
and my guest tonight is the man who directed it.

506
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,040
诸位 让我们欢迎Ron Howard
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ron Howard!

507
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,320
Ron Howard本人在此
Ron Howard is here.

508
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,600
你好吗 真人哦
How are you? He's here!

509
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,520
极速风流的导演 请坐
The man who made Rush. Have a seat.

510
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,080
好 Ron 那么多年来
Now, Ron, over the years,

511
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,320
你的电影被提名29座金像奖
your films have been nominated for 29 Oscars

512
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,800
而你本人也赢得两座
and I think you've won two yourself.

513
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,120
现在你做了一部时代电影
And now you've made a historical film

514
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,760
有关一项体育 世界上大部分人都没看过
about a sport that most of the world doesn't really watch.

515
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,520
你是怎么想到 “好啊我们来做Hunt和Lauda”的呢
So why did you think, "Yeah, Hunt and Lauda"?

516
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,480
因为故事很棒 具有人文关怀
Great story. Great human interest story,

517
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,840
而我对F1的了解 足够我意识到这是个很酷的竞技体育
and I knew just enough about Formula One to just know how cool it was.

518
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,440
而这些角色的组合
And I felt like the combination of those characters,

519
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,320
人物之间的戏剧张力
the kind of human drama,

520
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,400
特别是70年代的F1
the world of Formula One, particularly in the '70s,

521
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,920
绝对能给观众带来新鲜感受
was a chance to offer something fresh to audiences.

522
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,360
反正这电影 我本人是要看的
It was a movie I wanted to see.

523
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,520
我其实对此有点紧张 因为我觉得
I was nervous about it because I thought

524
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,440
哦 不 他们会把电影搞得太学究
oh, no, they'll make it too nerdy

525
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,160
然后大家都会说 F1很无趣
and everyone will say Formula One's boring,

526
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,960
或者他们会为了迎合好莱坞“速度感”
or they'll do a Hollywood number of "I love speed!"

527
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,680
从而将场景设置在纳斯卡里
and it will all be set in NASCAR

528
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,440
便于美国人理解
to make it easy for the Americans to understand.

529
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,600
但然而 事实并非如此
And yet, it's neither of those things.

530
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,640
这真的是能让人回到70年代的电影
It is genuinely a film that takes you back to the '70s,

531
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,000
那时赛车是如此具有危险性
when motor racing was bloody dangerous.

532
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,360
紧张的不光是你
You weren't the only one who was nervous.

533
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,400
你肯定会想让粉丝们感受到 我们有好好珍视这项体育
You certainly want the fans to feel the sport's respected,

534
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,080
但同时又要让各个层面的受众
but you also need to make a movie that works on a lot of levels

535
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,320
都能享受其中
for a lot of people.

536
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,520
我曾在拍阿波罗13号时这么干过
I had that opportunity with Apollo 13,

537
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,840
那也是我最享受拍摄的电影经历之一
and it's one of the films I enjoyed making most.

538
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,600
我也能说 拍极速风流也很享受
And I've got to tell you, Rush was right up there.

539
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,680
我玩得很开心
I had a blast.

540
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,000
我们这里有个片段 可以给大家看看
We've got a clip for those of you who want to see what it looks like.

541
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,280
现在就给你们看看 那电影可真了不起
We'll show it for you now, because it is quite something.

542
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,920
所有赛车手都会对自己撒谎说
There's a lie that all drivers tell themselves.

543
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,280
死亡只会轮到别人 轮不到自己
"Death is something that happens to other people."

544
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,360
谁会干这种工作呢 每年 我们其中的两人就会死去
What kind of person does a job like this? Each year, two of us die.

545
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,960
每次坐入车舱 我都接受这一事实
I accept every time I get in my car

546
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,400
有百分之二十的几率 我会死去
that there's a 20% chance I could die.

547
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,720
驾驶时速170英里吗 这玩意简直像炸弹般要命
Being driven round at 170 mph? This thing's a bomb on wheels.

548
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,120
-我比你们所有人都要快  -那我们比赛呀
-I'm quicker than all of you. -Then let's race.

549
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,920
我是世界冠军 并且将再次蝉联
I'm a world champion on the verge to become world champion again.

550
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,800
我可以打败他的 相信我
I could beat this guy. Trust me.

551
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,840
你离死亡越近 你会越发感觉到自己活着的实感
The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel.

552
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,920
这绝对能让他们吓得尿裤子
This lot are going to wet themselves.

553
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:41,240
在电影中 你表现Niki Lauda 种种缺点
In the film, you show Niki Lauda, warts and all.

554
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,320
我从来没想到过他会是那样 这个强迫症 很直接的人
I had no idea he was like that, this OCD, very straight guy.

555
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,240
他最后看到成品什么反应
How did he react when he saw the finished product?

556
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,080
他看了很感动
When he saw it, he was moved by it,

557
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,520
我觉得那是因为 对于那起事故
and I think it was because he never really had a perspective

558
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,640
他从未以其他角度来看
on that period around the accident.

559
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,640
首先 他不太记得了
First of all, he couldn't remember much of it.

560
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,440
其次 他只记得愤怒 众人当时如何
Secondly, what he does remember was all about the anger that people were

561
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
写他 以为他要死了
writing him off, thought he had died.

562
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,920
他都知道 以及目光短浅急于回来比赛
He could hear that. And also the myopic drive to get back in the car.

563
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,480
他就这么一根筋 基本上屏蔽掉其他所有事情
He was so single-minded that he blanked everything else out

564
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,600
而当他看这电影时 开始意识到
and when he saw this he began to realise what other

565
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,720
自己周围的人 特别是当时的夫人Marlene
people around him, Marlene, his wife then, in particular,

566
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,360
他们又经历了哪些 以更人文关怀的角度
what they were going through, and a more human side of it.

567
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,720
我觉得这点对他来说 很受情绪催动
and I think it was emotional for him to deal with.

568
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,280
同时你也将James Hunt
Then of course you've got James Hunt

569
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,080
刻画为与其竞争的角色
as the complete counterbalance to that.

570
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,240
我们在办公室墙上挂着James Hunt的照片
We've got a picture of James Hunt which we keep on our office wall.

571
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,680
基本上就可以完全总结他这个人 他的赛车
This just sums him up. His pop-riveted car.

572
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,880
他在想 等下我抽完了这根烟
He's thinking, "When I've finished this cigarette

573
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,560
喝完这罐酒 你 亲爱的 就是下一个
"and this can of beer, you, my dear, are next."

574
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,040
不过今天你就看不到这些了 真是悲剧
You just don't see this today. It is one of the tragedies.

575
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,600
你没法见到摆这姿势的尼克·罗斯伯格
You can't see Nico Rosberg posing.

576
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,000
如今他们只会这样 我想感谢我的手表制造商
"I would like to thank my watch manufacturer

577
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,680
我的帽子厂商 以及制油的人们
"and my hat manufacturer and the people who made my oil."

578
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,200
这就是我很喜欢当时的原因
That's what I really like about it.

579
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,800
这两个家伙 不归属于任何人
There are two guys, who bowed to no-one.

580
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,400
当时没有尤达大师指引他们去往崇高目标
There was no Yoda guiding them to their higher purpose.

581
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,720
他们都是以个人来定义自己
These were guys who defined themselves on their own terms,

582
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,680
虽然两人完全不同 而他们也背负着各自决定所带来的伤疤
very different terms, and they would bear the scars

583
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,280
但他们也能举起奖杯赢得胜利
of those decisions, but they also could certainly claim the triumphs.

584
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,280
我确定在场的所有人 我们转移话题聊开了去
I'm sure everybody in the room here... We move off Rush.

585
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,000
我确定在场的所有人看着你 在想
I'm sure everybody in the room here is looking at you thinking,

586
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,400
超过40岁的人们会想 你可真脸熟
everyone over 40 that is, thinking that is a familiar face,

587
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,280
因为有些人没意识到 你曾出演过情景喜剧 欢乐时光
because a lot of people don't realise that you were in Happy Days.

588
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,600
你是Richie Cunningham
You are Richie Cunningham.

589
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,080
没错
I was him.

590
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,760
我觉得这就是人们意难平的地方
It's one of those things I think people find hard to equate.

591
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,920
你是位优秀电影导演 但之前是喜剧演员
Here's this amazing film director, but you were,

592
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,840
所以你改换了方向 让我念念
so you really did obviously switch into directing and I was just

593
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,800
你之前导过的有名电影
making a list of the better-known ones that you've directed and...

594
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,040
真是了不起
This is extraordinary.

595
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,840
有 美人鱼 魔茧 阿波罗13号 达芬奇密码 美丽心灵
It's Splash, Cocoon, Apollo 13, Da Vinci Code, Beautiful Mind,

596
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,600
对话尼克松 天使与魔鬼
Frost/Nixon, Angels & Demons,

597
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,680
回火 温馨家族 那部很好笑呃 赎金
Backdraft, Parenthood - that's very funny - Ransom.

598
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,000
我想 等等 他演了欢乐时光 导了那么多电影
I'm just thinking, "Hang on a minute, he did Happy Days and all

599
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,120
而我做个汽车节目就累得不行 你时间哪里来的
"that. I do a car show and I'm flat-out." How do you find the time?

600
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,280
因为我非常享受自己的工作 都不需要其他兴趣爱好
The simple answer is I enjoy what I'm doing, so I don't need a hobby.

601
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,480
我就爱干这行
I love this.

602
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,000
出演欢乐时光后 你差不多一直在
Having been on a show like Happy Days, you sort of are doing

603
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,560
重复相同的人物
the same character over and over

604
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,360
而当我意识到自己有机会成为导演后
and when I realised I had a chance to be a director I thought,

605
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,560
我想要尽可能做多元化的事情
"I want to do as many diverse things as I possibly can."

606
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,480
所以我租了个16毫米摄像机
So I was renting 16mm cameras,

607
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,080
拍了自己第一部独立电影
making my own little independent movies.

608
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,760
然后自己的第一部电影 也是关于车的
Eventually doing my first movie, which was a car movie,

609
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,240
疯狂恋爱跑天下 没错 车祸喜剧
Grand Theft Auto. Of course. Car crash comedy.

610
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,080
那是我在拍欢乐时光的间隙制作的
I did that during one of the hiatuses from Happy Days.

611
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,120
-请允许我将话题转到你的个人生活上 你有四个孩子吗  -没错
Moving onto personal life if I may, four children? Yes.

612
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,560
-他们的中间名很让我感兴趣  -是啊 我猜也是
Their middle names interest me. Oh, yeah, I guess they might.

613
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,320
你有一个孩子的中间名叫 Dellas
You've got one called, middle name of Dallas. Yes.

614
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,040
-我猜名字来源于  -城市Dellas  -在那儿她
-Which I believe was named... -After the city.  -Where...?

615
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,400
她是在那里被怀上的
She was conceived. Yes.

616
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,240
然后你有一对双胞胎 他们的中间名是Carlyle
Then you've got twins, both of whom have the middle name Carlyle.

617
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,320
没错 在纽约有加旅馆叫 The Carlyle
Yes. In New York there is a lovely hotel called The Carlyle...

618
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,760
好吧 然后
OK. And...

619
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,400
然后我们往前推想时间 然后觉得
And we sorted that one out, kind of backtracked, and thought,

620
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,560
-那个当中间名也不错啊 要保持这一传统  -好
-"That's a very beautiful middle name, let's keep the tradition." -OK.

621
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,360
-小儿子叫Cross -Cross 全名是Reed Cross Howard
-The youngest son is called Cross. -Cross. Reed Cross Howard.

622
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,240
我们后来发现又怀上孩子了 很好
We sort of found out we were pregnant again. Great.

623
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,440
好 那让我们回想下
"All right, well let's sort through it.

624
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,800
不知道能不能想起来
"I wonder if we can figure it out.

625
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,440
沃尔沃可没法当中间名
（原来在车里 =_____=）
"Volvo is not much of a middle name."

626
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,000
是啊 沃尔沃可不行
And... Yeah, Volvo doesn't work.

627
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,960
但附近有条路叫Lower Cross Road
But there is a road near us called Lower Cross Road.

628
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,000
就是那辆沃尔沃所停之处
Which is where the Volvo was.

629
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,120
-我们婚姻很幸福  -可以想见 理查德也这么做了
We have a good marriage. Evidently. Richard Hammond does the same.

630
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,200
我那天和他的孩子聊天
I was talking to his kids the other day.

631
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,920
他们叫 公交车站 和 垃圾桶旁
They're called Bus Stop and By The Bins.

632
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,920
好 你是第一位正式开我们全新
Now, you are the first person to properly drive our brand-new

633
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,280
廉价车的嘉宾
reasonably-priced car.

634
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,160
-是呀  -你感觉如何
-Yes.  -What did you think of it?

635
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,320
首先我要说 右侧驾驶
First of all I will say the right-hand drive

636
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,920
而变速杆在左边 真让我不习惯
and the gearshift on the left was a concern to me.

637
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,240
是正确的方式
The correct way round.

638
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,920
绝对 让我困惑难安
It was... It definitely threw me.

639
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,640
在你放之前 我也向大家恳求
And I also implore, before you get into all this, I implore anyone who

640
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,520
如果你们对电影感兴趣的话 在电影里开车的不是我
has any interest in seeing my movie Rush, I didn't drive in the movie.

641
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,160
是真正的赛车手
Real drivers drove in the movie.

642
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,760
好 这就是你脱身的借口
Right, there's your excuses out of the way.

643
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,000
谁想看看Ron的单圈
Now who'd like to see Ron's lap?

644
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,800
想
Yes

645
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,720
-让我们来看看 -哦老天
-Let's have a look. -Oh, Lord.

646
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,040
看一看
Let's have a look.

647
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,360
看看这起步咆哮的车子
Look at that mighty machine leaping off the line.

648
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,480
你可得坚持住 Ron
You've got to stick it, Ron.

649
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,800
你真的得坚持住
You've got to really stick it.

650
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,400
Niki对我教导了一番
Niki was giving me a little coaching the other day.

651
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,160
这是Niki Laud解释
That's Niki Lauda's explanation.

652
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,720
你可得坚持住 你真的得坚持住
"You've got to stick it. You've got to really stick it."

653
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,040
老天爷 这算是坚持住了吗
Holy smokes. Is that sticking it?

654
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,280
我不知道 只走了赛道的一边
I don't know! Not using all the track.

655
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,680
很平滑
Smooth.

656
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,120
好 我可不知道
Right. I don't know.

657
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,360
车在那儿一段抓地很好
That car is gripping quite well there.

658
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,520
这一段我总是开得不顺
This is the one that always destroys me.

659
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,080
恐怖的锤头弯
The fearsome Hammerhead.

660
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,360
我真的搞砸了 是吧
I look like I'm being destroyed, don't I?

661
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,560
这看上去不错 真的很不错 非常紧凑
This is looking good. That's very good. Very tidy.

662
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,160
听听引擎声呀
Listen to that engine(!)

663
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,040
-哇 这车可真猛  -注意力集中
Wow, what a machine this is(!) Concentrate here a little bit.

664
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,480
看到没 我可是认真对待
See, I'm taking it seriously.

665
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,640
确实 那是注意力集中的表情
You were. That is a man who is concentrating.

666
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,960
经过连续弯时轮胎备受折磨 很漂亮
Tyres tortured as he goes through the follow-through. Nicely done.

667
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,600
切弯很好 让我们看看倒数第二弯
Nicely cut. Let's have a look at the second-to-last corner.

668
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,080
这里总会有点 哇 爽气
This is the bit normally catch... Oh! Bang on.

669
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:54,480
而到甘邦弯 看看这抓地 干得真不错
And then on into Gambon and look at that grip. That's bloody good.

670
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,200
然后我们冲过终点
There we are across the line.

671
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,400
哇
Wow.

672
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:10,120
-谢谢 -那么 Ron 板上成绩不多
-Thank you. -So, Ron, not many times on the board.

673
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,160
-你觉得自己排名如何  -老天
-Where do you think you've come? -Lord.

674
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,320
比我想象中的要好一点
It wasn't quite as ugly as I imagined it would be.

675
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,680
导演的眼光让我觉得自己很糟糕
My director's eye on the outside had it looking pretty bad.

676
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,040
看上去很顺畅 没法说有多快 但很顺
It looked smooth. Not sure about fast, but it looked smooth.

677
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,480
你觉得在哪里
Where do we think?

678
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,040
我只希望自己别垫底
I'd like to think I'm not flat on the bottom.

679
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,400
那一位是Genesis的Mike Rutherford
That would be Mike Rutherford out of Genesis.

680
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,160
我怀疑自己就在最后
I suspect I'm right down there.

681
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,880
-我是这么想的  -Ron Howard 你的成绩是 1分
That's where I think. Ron Howard, you did it in 1...

682
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,600
好 是个好开头
Right. So that's good. OK.

683
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:45,120
-40 -哦 所以不是垫底 还不错
-..40.  -Oh, OK, not the very bottom. So that's good. OK.

684
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,400
但接下来一位数并不是太好
The next bit's not so good.

685
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,080
9秒9
..9.9.

686
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,600
所以 你不是最后一名
OK. You're not the bottom.

687
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,160
那也意味着 我们终于找到了
So what this means is we've finally found something

688
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,320
你不擅长的事物了
you can't do.

689
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,960
擅长导演 在欢乐时光里 表现极佳
Good at directing, brilliant in Happy Days,

690
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,520
很有魅力的人 但驾驶水平糟糕
a charming human being, but utterly crap at driving.

691
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,880
-说得有道理 -诸位 Ron Howard 谢谢你
Fair enough. Ladies and gentlemen, Ron Howard. Thank you.

692
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

693
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,280

你们有可能在几个月之前见证了
Now you may have seen that a few
months ago

694
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,200

著名的BBC电视演播中心的关闭仪式
the famous BBC TV Centre
closed down.

695
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,920
那一刻 电波中弥漫着
When it did, the airwaves were
swamped with emotional

696
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,200
电视界大佬们的颂词
tributes from the giants
of television.

697
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,760
例如 罗尼·柯贝特 大卫·爱登堡 迈克尔·帕金森。
Ronnie Corbett, David
Attenborough, Michael Parkinson.

698
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,600
但是Top Gear却没能参与其中 而现在
But nothing from Top Gear.
Until now.

699
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
这就是我们所谈论的那栋大楼
This is the building in question.

700
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,840
53年以来 它一直是世界上某些标志性
For 53 years, it was the engine
room for some of the most iconic

701
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,440
电视节目的源泉
television in the world.

702
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,560
但是如今 这里所剩无几
But now, today,
this is all that's left.

703
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,600
但这也是个好消息
And that is great news

704
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,240
因为我们发现一旦把
because what we've realised is that
once you take away all

705
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,720
人员和茶几等全部清空，然后锁上门
the people and the tea trolley
and you've locked all the doors

706
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,920
这栋被抛弃的大楼就变成了一个极佳的赛场
this abandoned building makes
an excellent venue for a race.

707
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,480
这些弯曲的走廊
You have these curving corridors
that could be long, fast

708
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,440
好比顶级F1赛道上的快速弯
sweepers on a top F1 track.

709
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,640
还有这些漂亮的办公室 充斥着各种有趣障碍物
You have these beautiful offices
full of interesting obstacles

710
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,680
以及技巧性弯道。
and technical turns.

711
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,600
同时 你可以好好在室外透透气
And you have all this outdoor area
where you can literally

712
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,680
（暗指进行腾空的特技表演）
get some air.

713
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,560
总体来说 这是一个公认的独特而刺激的赛场
All in all, a unique and exciting
racing circuit I think you'll agree.

714
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,840
至于参赛选手嘛
And so to the racers.

715
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,600
很不幸 因为杰瑞米前阵子用Peel P50证明过
isn't very suitable for cars,

716
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,160
这栋大楼不适合汽车通行
Now, unfortunately this building
as indeed Jeremy proved a
while back with the Peel P50.

717
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,360
所以今天我们会让他们进行对决 他们仨
So today we'll be racing these two.
Of which there are three.

718
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,760
我们有道吉·拉姆金骑士
We have Dougie Lampkin MBE,

719
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,440
获得过16个世界冠军头衔的计时赛摩托车手
a trials rider with 16 World
Titles to his name.

720
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,320
他的对手是蒂姆·歇尔夫和保罗·约瑟夫，
And he's up against Tim Shieff
and Paul Joseph,

721
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,160
两个世界上最牛的跑酷选手
two of the finest Free
Runners on the planet.

722
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,560
他们俩之间虽然没有发动机
They may not have an
engine between them

723
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,640
但显然他们可以沿着走廊飞奔
but apparently they can
run along corridors and scamper over

724
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,240
还能像兴奋的松鼠一样 在阳台和消防通道来回蹦跶
balconies and fire escapes
like a couple of randy squirrels.

725
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,520
参赛选手介绍结束
So with the introductions over,
let's look at the route

726
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,720
让我们来看看比赛路线
of the race itself.

727
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,600
这是电视演播中心的鸟瞰图
Here we have a birds' eye
view of Television Centre.

728
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,400
实际上只是个模型
It's actually only a model.

729
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,640
你会看到它形似一个问号
And you will see it's shaped
a little bit like a question mark.

730
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,120
我提议从这个地方开始比赛
So what I'm proposing is
we start here, which is

731
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,920
差不多是我们现在站的地方
roughly where we're standing now,

732
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,480
从这个问号的底部进入建筑物
enter the building at the base of
the question mark

733
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,200
然后在建筑里面一路赛到这里结束
and then race all the way
through it to finish here

734
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,840
就在那个上面
which is up there.

735
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,040
随着激动的观赛人群开始聚集
'As an excited crowd gathered,
I positioned

736
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,600
我自己站到了终点线的位置
'myself on the finish line.'

737
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:19,800
各就各位 3,2,1
Are you ready? In three, two,
one.

738
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,200
HORN

739
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,400
有趣的是 道吉·拉姆金选择穿门而过。
This is interesting. Dougie Lampkin
has chosen to go through the door.

740
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,360
但两个小青年选择从外部攀爬而上
'But the youths are making their way
up the outside of the building

741
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,040
这主意不错
which actually isn't such a bad
idea'

742
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,840
因为你一旦进入建筑内就被束缚了
because once you're inside here,
you will be completely baffled.

743
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,040
如果他们呆在建筑的外面
If they stay on the outside they
will have some idea

744
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,200
他们就会知道到底在朝哪行进
of where they're going.'

745
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,760
好样的
Good thinking.

746
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,440
不错 这个可以让我通过大楼的闭路摄像头
Right, this should allow me to get
a direct feed

747
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,400
来直接观察比赛动向
from any of the
CCTV cameras around the building.

748
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,040
这是那两个不安分的小伙子
And there are the jumpy boys.

749
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,200
他俩现在是突发新闻
They are literally breaking news.

750
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,840
当两个小青年穿过新闻演播室的时候
As the youths made their way
through the newsroom,

751
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,280
道吉·拉姆金正在寻找上楼的路线
'Dougie was looking for a way
upstairs.'

752
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,400
他在这里
There is Dougie Lampkin.

753
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,120
在新闻之夜演播间 两个年轻人走了死胡同
In the Newsnight office, the youths
had found their path blocked

754
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,440
他们不得不再次下楼。
and were having to
make their way down again.'

755
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,680
又发现自己其实被锁在了BBC酒吧
Having found himself literally in a
lock-in in the BBC bar

756
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,000
道吉同样也得再找一条下楼的路
Dougie too needed to find a way
back down.'

757
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,440
天知道他会在“问号”的根部
So he is, God knows,
somewhere over in the main

758
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,640
和弯头连接的什么地方冒出来
leg of the question mark just
approaching the curvy bit.

759
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,160
我也不清楚到底哪边领先 但是比赛相当刺激
I've no idea who's in the lead,
but it's very exciting.

760
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,880
哥们 那个门是锁着的
That, chaps, is a locked door.'

761
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,680
卫生部表示
The Health and Safety department
will have something to

762
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,040
有话要说
say about that.

763
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,520
回到演播室 戴立克
Into the studio and the Daleks still
waiting

764
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,320
还在楼梯底下呆着
at the bottom of the stairs
there.

765
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,720
令人惊讶的是即使两个年轻人在六楼的
Amazingly even though the youths
were now at the management

766
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,480
管理层办公室里面
offices on the sixth floor

767
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,280
做起决定也不磨叽
they were having no trouble
making decisions.'

768
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,480
与此同时 在彻底败给了BBC的迷宫走廊后
Meanwhile Dougie, now completely
frustrated by the maze

769
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,720
道吉决定采取一套更加直接的解决方案。
of BBC corridors, had
decided on a more direct approach.'

770
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,560
噢
Oh.

771
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,040
我想道吉·拉姆金正赶往楼顶
And Dougie Lampkin is going onto
the roof I believe.

772
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,280
我能听到摩托车的声音
I can hear a bike.

773
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,200
女士们先生们 获胜者是道吉·拉姆金
It's Dougie Lampkin,
ladies and gentlemen!

774
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,960
一场对BBC电视演播中心的
What a fantastic two-wheeled
tribute

775
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,440
惊艳摩托礼赞
（电视中心邮编是：W12 8QT）
to BBC Television Centre
W12 8QT.

776
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,040
先生 恭喜你。
Congratulations, sir.

777
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,160
那两个跑酷的哥们呢
Where are the Free Runners?

778
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,080
他们来了
And here they come.

779
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,040
蒂姆·歇尔夫 保罗·约瑟夫 很接近
Tim Shieff, Paul Joseph, close,

780
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,280
但还是略有差距
not quite close enough,

781
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,920
无论如何还是好样的
but well done anyway.

782
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,440
完美 给力的比赛 获胜者道吉·拉姆金感觉如何
Well done, great race. Your victor,
Dougie Lampkin. How was it?

783
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,360
我累坏了 那玩意就像一迷宫。
I'm knackered.
That thing's a labyrinth.

784
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,320
你们应该知道那个高高的东西是电梯吧
You know there's a lift?
In that tall bit there.

785
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,240
你们可以坐它直达屋顶
You just go straight up to the top.

786
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,880
太不可思议了 那俩哥们的动作我一个都不会
That was incredible. I couldn't do
a single thing that those guys did.

787
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,760
我曾想去骑摩托车 但我带不上头盔
I was going to do the bike.
I couldn't put the helmet on.

788
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,480
那一个腾空跳跃真是碉堡了
The jumps were amazing.

789
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,600
我只想说在录制这段影片的时候
I just want to say that
when I made that film

790
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,280
电视演播中心已经关闭了 但就在那时
Television Centre had closed, but
since then, owing to the unique way

791
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,840
由于BBC奇葩的运营方式 中心被再次启用
the BBC is run,
they've decided to open it again.

792
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,160
LAUGHTER

793
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,560
-额 所以你为一个不会关闭的建筑物拍了一段纪念影片
-是滴
Right, so you've made a tribute film
to a building that isn't shut? Yes.

794
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,880
-这就像为霍莉·威洛比写讣告
-是的。
（霍莉·威洛 著名模特）
Isn't that like making an obituary
for Holly Willoughby? Yes.

795
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,680
但是想象一下当你发现她依旧活着的时候
But imagine how pleased you'd be

796
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,440
你会有多高兴
when you found out
she was still alive.

797
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,720
-就是这个道理
-同志们 我能打断一下吗
That's a point. Chaps,
may I interrupt?

798
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,640
我非常喜欢你的出租车大击爆
Because I much enjoyed your
smashing-up-the-taxi film

799
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,760
还有你的在摩托车手和
and your race
between the motorcyclist

800
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,200
两个路人大对决 但恐怕我们现在要严肃一点
and the two pedestrians, but I'm
afraid we have to get serious now.

801
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,240
因为我们收到了一封来信 哦不！信是来自
Because we've had a letter.
Oh, no! It's from...

802
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,920
一个说话拐弯抹角心胸狭窄的呆子
Well, it's from a mealy-mouthed,
small-minded idiot.

803
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,160
他说到:"亲爱的杰瑞米·克拉克森 由于英国太过拥挤
And it says, "Dear Jeremy Clarkson,
because Britain is so crowded

804
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,760
交通拥堵严重 拥有一辆法拉利其实毫无意义
"and there's so much traffic,
there's no point owning a Ferrari

805
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,160
同理可得 在节目里试一辆法拉利也毫无意义"
"and therefore no point road
testing them on your programme."

806
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,080
呵呵 我不同意 二呆小气先生的观点
Well, now I disagree,
Mr Small-minded Idiot.

807
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,160
因为在英国 有很多地方
Because there are plenty of places
in Britain

808
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,640
其实一点也不拥挤。
that aren't crowded at all.

809
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,960
这里是赫特福德郡。
This is Hertfordshire.

810
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,240
离伦敦仅40英里 是驾驶者的天堂。
It's just 40 miles from London
and it's motoring nirvana.

811
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,080
万事俱备
Mmm! We have everything we need.

812
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,200
广阔的景色 迂回的道路 没有交通堵塞
Huge scenery, swooping road,
no traffic.

813
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,040
对那些习惯在圣餐酒上标上辛烷值的人来说
The Holy Trinity for anyone whose
communion wine comes with

814
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,880
这简直是三位一体的感觉
an octane rating.

815
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,840
在英国不能享受一辆法拉利 怎么可能
Can't enjoy a Ferrari in Britain?
Oh, yes, you can.

816
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,080
但是你能消受我开的这台么
But can you enjoy THIS one?

817
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,480
他的名字叫F12。
It's called the F12.

818
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,160
她价值240,000镑 因为有台730马力V12发动机
It costs £240,000 and thanks to
a 730 horsepower V12 it's

819
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,520
她是目前法拉利所生产的马力最大的街车
the most powerful road-going
Ferrari ever made.

820
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,000
其实它阿隆索的F1赛车一样猛
It's almost as powerful, in fact, as
Fernando Alonso's Formula 1 racer.

821
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,000
当然这时 那些吃饱了撑着的人会说
Of course, at this point, people
with mouths of meal would say,

822
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,840
"这么些马力在限速面前到底有何意义"
"What's the point of all that
when we've got speed limits?"

823
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,560
你不必每时每刻都用尽所有的马力
You don't have to use
all of it all the time.

824
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,200
在小镇里面 你可放松坐着 打开收音机
In a town, you can sit back,
turn on the radio,

825
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,600
把悬架设置为颠簸路面模式
put the suspension in bumpy road
mode to make everything nice

826
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,720
让一切变得安逸而舒适 把变速箱和空调
and comfy, set the gearbox in
automatic,

827
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,360
都设置为自动
the air conditioning just so,

828
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,920
然后你就可以很愉悦的以每小时20英里兜风
and then you can drive along quite
happily at 20 miles an hour.

829
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,960
轻松 这车还不会显得特别大
Easy. 'It's not even
especially big.'

830
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,320
我当然不是说这车很袖珍
I'm not saying this is tiny,

831
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,680
但不是宽大的太离谱 你不用每次变道都这么狰狞
but it's not preposterous. You don't
go through every gap like that.

832
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,800
所以这车在莱奇沃斯就和别的车一样好开
So this car works in Letchworth
just like any other car.

833
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:39,280
但驶出城区以后 一切就变得十分与众不同
But when the built-up area ends,
it's not like any other car at all.

834
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,480
喔 真快
Wow. Wow, this is fast.

835
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,840
法拉利官方称 0至到60英里加速需3.1秒
Ferrari say it will
go from 0 to 60 in 3.1 seconds.

836
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,640
极速可达每小时211英里
And that flat-out, it will be
doing 211 miles an hour.

837
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,600
而且不仅强有力的发动机使这辆车如此狂暴
And it's not just the massive engine
which makes it all so savage.

838
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,960
与老款的599不同 这辆车配备了双离合器变速箱
Unlike the old 599, this has
a double clutch gearbox,

839
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,560
所以换挡十分直接迅速
so gear changes are immediate.

840
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,600
你只要飚起来 直到浪声血洗你的耳朵
You build up the speed
until the noise gets too much

841
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,000
然后升档
and your ears are bleeding
and then you change up

842
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,080
没有换挡间隙 衔接十分流畅 这是怎么做到的
and there's no gap. How do
you do that?

843
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,040
他们还给这车配备了更复杂的牵引力控制系统
They've also fitted a more
sophisticated traction

844
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,000
可以使你享受的同时不发生车祸
control system which lets you have
fun without allowing you to crash.

845
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,440
但最惊艳的是这辆车如何腾云驾雾
But the most impressive thing is how
this car manages the air.

846
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,960
这些薄片 在刹车片温度升高的时候会打开
These flaps down here,
when the brakes are hot, they open,

847
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,600
用气流冷却刹车
to allow cooling air to
pass on to the discs.

848
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,480
但其他的时候 他们会关闭 来保证更好的空气动力学效应
But the rest of the time, they're
shut for better aerodynamics.

849
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,760
再来看看引擎盖两侧的风道
And then you have these channels
on either side of the bonnet.

850
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,720
空气被沿着这些通道汇集起来
The air is funnelled along them

851
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,120
进入这里然后从这里流出
into here and out of here
so it provides a boundary

852
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,840
让气流更为爽滑地
layer of smooth air passing down the
flanks of the car

853
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,640
流经车身侧面
making it more slippery.

854
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,600
而且还提供了非常实在的下压力
There's real downforce as well.

855
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,880
在车速为125英里每小时的时候
At 125 miles an hour,
the weight of the air

856
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,600
空气压到车身上的重量可以达到19英石。
pressing down on the car
is 19 stone.

857
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,520
仿佛让约翰·普莱斯科坐在车顶上
That's like having half
of John Prescott on the roof forcing

858
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,480
迫使轮胎紧贴沥青路面 来获取更好的抓地力
the tyres into the Tarmac,
giving better grip.

859
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,840
他们用尽一切所学的知识
They have done everything
in the book to exploit

860
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,400
来榨取出强大的火力。
the colossal firepower.

861
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,480
而成果让人如痴如醉
And the results are mesmerising.

862
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,320
在过去 法拉利让人感觉笨重
In the past, big Ferraris felt big.

863
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:10,080
Testarossa 612 都巨大无比 他们就像大胖子的座驾
The Testarossa, the 612, they were
immense. They were fat-boy cars.

864
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,720
这一辆却不是 它很轻 很灵活 很犀利。
This isn't. This is light
and nimble and sharp.

865
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,120
这车棒极了
It's... It is spectacular.

866
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,440
我必须承认 虽然这辆车很给力
I must confess though that
while the car is fine,

867
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,920
但我却很挣扎 因为在这车里面我感觉有些躁动
I am struggling, because
it is a bit frantic in here.

868
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,040
我刚刚飞了车
I just went airborne then.

869
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,800
你们了解早期的飞行员在两马赫的速度下
You read about those early test
pilots in Mach Two

870
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,760
测试喷气式战斗机的极限状态的那种感觉
jet fighters going to the very
limits of what was possible.

871
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,560
就跟我坐在这里的感受一样 感觉自己快疯了
That's what it feels like in this -
like you're sort of out of control.

872
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:10,000
而且这辆车的转向不可思议的灵敏
And it has incredibly fast steering,
so the slightest movement

873
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,320
方向盘上任何细小的动作都会使车辆偏转
of the wheel causes an immediate
dart one way or the other.

874
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,120
再就是油门的问题
And then there's the throttle.

875
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,400
一脚油门下去 你本想说:"哦 耶"
You put your foot down
and you think, "Whoa, yes,"

876
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,400
然后你立马反应:"诶 卧槽 吓尿了"
and then immediately you think,
"No, actually. Too scary."

877
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,600
当你的生活如此富有激情的时候
And when life is as hectic as this,
what you really

878
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,560
你想要的是让操控回归传统
want are for all the controls
to be conventional.

879
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,960
但事实并非如此
And they're not.

880
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,560
所有控制灯光 雨刷 包括转向灯
All the knobs and buttons
for the lights and the wipers

881
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,000
的拨杆和按钮 都在旋转的方向盘上
and the indicators are all
on the steering wheel

882
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,480
所以他们从来不会停留在原来的位置
which moves about, so they're never
where you left them.

883
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,560
你甚至不能在开这车的时候打喷嚏
You can't even sneeze
when you're driving this car

884
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,840
因为如果你打了 喷嚏就会带你亲近路边水沟
because if you did... Well, they'd
have to hose you off the road.

885
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,480
为了向你们解释我到底是神马意思
To try and explain
what I'm on about,

886
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,600
我来到了这片网球场
I've come to this tennis court.

887
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:14,360
现在好比在赫特福德郡的道路上
This is what it's like to drive
an ordinary car

888
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,880
驾驶一辆普通汽车
on the roads of Hertfordshire.

889
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,680
来吧 高尔夫GTi
There you go, Golf GTI...

890
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,720
宝马 M3 法拉利 458 这很简单
BMW M3, Ferrari 458. This is easy

891
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,720
而且易于掌控
and manageable

892
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,320
我可以一整天都干这个
and I could do it all day.

893
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:39,160
现在让我来展示一下驾驶F12
Now let me show you what
it's like to drive

894
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,440
是个神马感受
a Ferrari F12.

895
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:51,520
啊哦 擦 打脸了
Ugh! Ugh! Oh, in the face!

896
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,880
Stig说 这是世界上唯一一辆能让LFA
The Stig says, this is the only
car in the world that can hold

897
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,640
望其项背的车。
a candle to the Lexus LFA.

898
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,960
他还说到这是他开过的法拉利里
He also says it's the first Ferrari
he's ever driven that he

899
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,680
第一辆激起他购买欲望的车
would actually buy -

900
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,960
前提是他有金钱的概念 但显然他没有
if he had any concept of money,
which of course he doesn't.

901
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,800
在我看来 虽然这车已经堪称完美
Me, though... It is brilliant,

902
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,000
但我认为 如果转向稍微迟钝一点 动力稍弱一点
but I think it would be better still
if it had slower steering...

903
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,920
会更好 虽然这话我自己都觉得难以启齿
and it's hard for me to say this,
but a bit less power.

904
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,040
是的 你可以在英国享受这辆车带来的快感
Yes, you can really enjoy it
in Britain,

905
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,880
但是你无法消受这辆车的全部潜能
but you can't really enjoy
all of it.

906
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

907
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,320
太棒了 我还是继续选择LFA
It is frantic.
I'd still have an LFA.

908
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,480
尽管F12长长的选装清单
The LFA is 100 grand more

909
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,400
让这车的价格飙升至35万英镑
although the options on this,

910
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,040
LFA还是要贵10万多
they do take it up to 350 as well.

911
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,000
等一下  你说啥
Hang on, hang on, hang on. What?

912
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,920
杰瑞米·克拉克森 我刚才是不是听到你说
Did I just hear you,
Jeremy Clarkson,

913
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,760
-"马力稍微弱一点"
-是的 你没听错
say that you'd like "a bit less
power"? Yes, you did.

914
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,640
这是不是有点像戈登·拉姆齐说
Isn't that a bit like Gordon Ramsay
saying, "Yes, I like this dish,

915
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,360
"我喜欢这道菜 但我希望菜的味道淡一点就更好了"
"but I wish it had a bit less
flavour."

916
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,640
或者詹姆斯·梅说到
Or James May saying,
"Yes, I like this, but can it be

917
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,880
"是的 我喜欢这个 但是棕色能少些吗"
"a bit less brown?"

918
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,600
是的 的确如此 但这是一个爆炸性新闻意味着 节目可以结束了
No, it is like that, but it is a
bombshell, which means we can end.

919
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,680
感谢大家的收看 我们下周再见 保重
Thank you very much for watching.
See you all next week. Take care.

920
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,960
大家晚安
Good night.
