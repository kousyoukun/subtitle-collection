00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,609
{\an8}麦凯恩投资公司
爷就是来抢的

2
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:18,330
劳动节后坚决不穿白色衣服

3
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:26,949
肯特・布罗克曼为您现场播报  
This is Kent Brockman

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,161
这里是第一届春田镇年度国际汽车大奖赛
at the 1st Annual Springfield Grand Prix,

5
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:31,867
与镇上其他展示活动一样
which, like all our town showcase events,

6
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:35,466
不仅筹划差  举办的也相当糟糕
is not only poorly planned, it's horribly executed.

7
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:37,570
{\an8}慢行  前方施工

8
00:01:39,117 --> 00:01:39,992
{\an8}道路施工  暂时关闭

9
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:42,661
{\an8}伯恩斯的帝国大厦正在施工

10
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:42,667
施工中的帝国大厦
The Making of the Empire State Building,

11
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,114
第一步  建造地基
Part One: The Basement.

12
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:02,735
等待空隙
Wait for the gap...

13
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:04,265
等待空隙
Wait for the gap.

14
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:06,847
侯默  咱明天再买胶带吧
Homer, we can buy Scotch tape tomorrow.

15
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,238
有空隙
There's the gap!

16
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:11,018
空隙太小了
Gap's too small!

17
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:15,192
哪来的车队
A peloton?

18
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:17,115
显然  今天也是环春田镇
Apparently, today is also the final stage

19
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:19,608
自行车大赛的最后一天
of the Tour De Springfield bike race.

20
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:23,655
那个骑法酷毙了
Hey, that's some fancy riding.

21
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:32,210
{\an8}赛后舞会
种族主义舞会在街上举办

22
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:35,803
今天  确切的说  既无赢家也无输家
Truthfully, today, there were no losers and no winners

23
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:39,636
因为两场比赛的终点线都用来捆垃圾了
since both finish lines were tangled up in this unholy mess.

24
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:42,586
我听到里面有敲击声
I hear tapping from inside.

25
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:44,084
什么情况
What's goin' on?

26
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:47,881
大家敲击自己的脚趾
Well, uh, let's, uh, all start tapping our toes

27
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,729
和着卡洛威
to the sounds of Scab Calloway 

28
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,501
和他没章法的乐队的调子起舞吧
and his non-union band.

29
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,413
在里面安静呆着
Uh, keep it down in there.

30
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:01,899
你这算是约会
So, is this a "Date" Date 

31
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,561
还是算朋友间无意义的聚会
or just a meaningless friend thing?

32
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:05,521
-无意义的聚会  -爱情约会
- Meaningless friend thing. - True love super date!

33
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:08,455
要是你们在一起还生了孩子
Well, if you two ever get serious and have a baby,

34
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,580
我想它一定会长这样
it'll look something like this.

35
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,598
千万别听你巴仔叔叔胡扯
Don't listen to Uncle Bart.

36
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,693
丽莎和我会用爱来抚养你
Lisa and I will raise you in a house of love.

37
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:20,438
我们才不会生孩子
We're not having a baby.

38
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,122
我的小吉米
Jimmy!

39
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:23,198
额滴天
Oh, brother.

40
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:24,672
还是跳舞吧
Let's dance.

41
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:30,434
来搞笑的吧
Geek leak!

42
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:35,249
巴仔  至少我还能有个伴
Hey, Bart, at least I've got a date.

43
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:37,596
谁来跟我跳支舞
Dance with me, please.

44
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:39,016
我得反驳一下她
I need to zing my sister.

45
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:41,388
没问题  不过你要把作业写完
Okay, but you have to do your homework.

46
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,332
开个玩笑
Just kidding.

47
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:43,738
这一点我早就放弃了
I've given up on that.

48
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:46,165
别废话了赶紧跳吧
Just move your girdle, Yertle.

49
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:48,825
丽莎  你的舞伴
Hey, Lisa, your dance partner

50
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:51,341
傻得都上了《呆子》杂志的封面了
just made the cover Dorks Illustrated magazine.

51
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,895
我知道这是挑衅  不过
I know that's a zing, but still...

52
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:55,021
我居然上了封面
the cover!

53
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:56,516
你给我听着  巴仔
Now, you listen to me, Bart.

54
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:59,025
也许与苗浩斯的约会并不完美
Milhouse may not be the perfect date.

55
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:01,574
主啊  这里一定要来个"但是"
Please let there be a "But" Coming, please!

56
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,323
-但是  -太棒了
- But... - Landed it!

57
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:07,798
至少还有人愿意为我付出
At least I'm with someone who tries a little too hard

58
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,554
因为他真心爱我
because he really likes me.

59
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,823
为我巴仔所倾倒的辣妹多了去了
Hey, plenty of babes have docked in Porta de Barto.

60
00:04:12,823 --> 00:04:14,548
没错  但都不超过一星期
Yeah, for about a week.

61
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:16,533
一旦识破你那虚伪的嘴脸
But as soon as they get to know the real you,

62
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,527
她们都会跟你一刀两断
they departo de Barto.

63
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:20,762
所以今晚就只有你一个人
That's why you're alone tonight.

64
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:24,819
天啊  是真的吗
Oh my God, is that true?

65
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,836
丽莎说得没错  孩子
Yeah, I'm afraid Lisa's right, son.

66
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:27,882
要说已故的伟大导演
If the late, great 

67
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:30,673
诺拉・伊弗龙教会我们什么的话
Nora Ephron taught us anything, it's...

68
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:33,484
我的另一个充气娃娃怎么也来了
Oh! What's my other inflatable doll doing here?

69
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:37,191
什么  什么
What? What?

70
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:38,754
我就是自己来的
I ain't here with no one.

71
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:45,972
{\an8}巴仔的垃圾宝箱

72
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:50,028
丽莎说得没错
Oh, man, Lisa's right.

73
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:52,421
我谈的这些恋爱都没持续多久
None of these relationships lasted very long.

74
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,534
三天
Three days.

75
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:54,633
一次休假
One recess.

76
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,689
半次野营
Half a field trip.

77
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:58,924
为啥我在天文馆这么衰
Why did I have to get so needy at the planetarium?

78
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:00,834
儿子  要是有人需要我
Boy, if anyone needs me, 

79
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:01,979
我就在浴室洗爆米花浴
I'll be taking a popcorn bath.

80
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,313
这是我从男人健康杂志上读到的
It's a thing I read about in a Men's Health magazine

81
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:05,498
不过是在梦中
in a dream.

82
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:07,354
老爸  我能问你个问题吗
Dad, can I ask you a question?

83
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:10,565
你是怎么把妈妈追到手的
How did you ever get a woman like Mom to stay with you?

84
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:12,951
对着镜子  祈祷奇迹
Look in the mirror, unplanned miracle.

85
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:14,526
就这样吗
Is that the only reason?

86
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:17,109
我还能让事情变得有趣
Well, I also keep things interesting.

87
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,768
谁把微波炉抱走了
All right, who took the microwave?

88
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:21,449
看到了吧
You see?

89
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,710
你在看什么
Hey, what are you looking at?

90
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,185
我以前的女朋友们
My ex-girlfriends.

91
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,062
孩子  我懂得
Aw, boy, I feel for you.

92
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:27,596
没人喜欢被拒绝
Nobody likes to be rejected

93
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:30,364
这很难释怀  除非你会喝酒
and it never gets easier, until you can drink.

94
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,770
这样你就可以在电话定酒时  
Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings

95
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,475
对人吐露你的不幸
by drunk dialing.

96
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:35,265
这样
Observe.

97
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:37,321
我又来了
Hey, it's me again.

98
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,970
他在那  对吧
He's there, isn't he?

99
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,697
我希望这么说不会太奇怪
Well, I hope this doesn't sound weird,

100
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:42,805
我正藏在你的衣橱里
but I'm inside your closet.

101
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:46,381
有点意思  可我要去找她们
Um, that's awesome, but I think I'll visit my ex-girlfriends

102
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:48,707
证明她们还喜欢我
and prove they still like me.

103
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:53,642
是我
It's me.

104
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:55,460
我想你了
I was thinking about you.

105
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,628
三  四个月后就是你的生日吧
It's your birthday in like, three, four months?

106
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:01,464
我想为你办个聚会  可以吗 
Would it be weird if I threw you a party?

107
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:04,682
去吃翔吧
Eat my shorts!

108
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:06,629
去死吧
Drop dead.

109
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:08,700
吃我一拳  混蛋
Eat fist, jerk.

110
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:12,540
你真有胆  居然来找我
You've got a lot of nerve showing up here...

111
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,961
怎么不亲我一下
and not giving me a kiss.

112
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,834
你真敢
Inappropriate!

113
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,002
我想你
I miss you.

114
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,417
跟踪狂
Stalker!

115
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:21,208
救我
Save me.

116
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:25,766
Mary Spuckler
Mary Spuckler,

117
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,478
你是我最后的机会了
you're my last chance.

118
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:29,931
她居然是克里塔斯的女儿  真可爱
She's pretty cute for Cletus's daughter.

119
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,510
是啊  她跟正常儿童一样
Yeah, she liked to drink milk 

120
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,026
喜欢喝牛奶而不是白漆
as a kid instead of white paint.

121
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,537
你是我孩子吗
Is you one of my kids?

122
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:37,713
不是的  先生
No, sir.

123
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:38,415
证明一下
Prove it.

124
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,574
A  B  C
A, b, c...

125
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:40,818
好了  好了
All right. All right.

126
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,770
你说服我了  爱因斯坦
You convinced me, Einstein.

127
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,714
你要做什么
What you want?

128
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:44,789
玛丽在吗
Is Mary here?

129
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,941
她离家出走了
I'm afraid Mary done run off.

130
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,063
俺们也不知道她去哪儿了
We knows not where.

131
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:50,362
我勒个去
Dadgummit.

132
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:51,828
你觉得她还爱着我吗
Do you think she still likes me?

133
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,976
布兰迪
Um, hey, Brandine!

134
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:56,199
玛丽还喜欢这小子吗
Does Mary still like this boy?

135
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,989
俺不知道那丫头喜欢谁
I don't know what that girl likes anymore.

136
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:01,599
知道俺们要把她嫁给井底的老男人后  
She ran away after we engaged her 

137
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,180
她就跑了
to Old Man Wellbottom.

138
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,535
我能做一个好丈夫的
And I was gonna be a good husband, too!

139
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:06,646
只要我能从这里出来
If'n I ever get out of this well.

140
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:08,773
好了  好了
All right. All right now.

141
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:10,596
你先闭嘴吧
That's enough out of you.

142
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,797
可我
But I just--

143
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:14,974
真不敢相信她走了
Oh, I can't believe she ran away.

144
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:16,768
这也帮不上忙
And this isn't helping.

145
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:18,679
我还是换个更猛的吧
I better switch to the hard stuff.

146
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:19,734
好啊  小乡巴佬
Hey, Dubya.

147
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:22,140
我知道我妹妹去哪里了
I know where my sister run off to.

148
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,056
纽约城
New York City.

149
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:24,992
纽约
New York?

150
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:26,946
芝麻街就在那儿
That's where Sesame Street is.

151
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,482
你没想过垃圾日那天奥斯卡会怎样吗
Do you ever wonder what happens to Oscar on garbage day?

152
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:32,498
对  纽约
Yup, New York.

153
00:07:32,498 --> 00:07:34,219
大城市
The big something.

154
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:35,889
这是她的地址
This here's her address.

155
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,192
祝你好运
Good luck!

156
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,262
咱为啥要到这儿来  巴仔・辛普森
I don't know if we should be up here, Bart Simpson.

157
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:49,333
那为啥呢
And why is that?

158
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:52,123
地板还没装完呢
'Cause the floor ain't finished.

159
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:55,349
老爸只是盖上稻草就说完工了
Daddy just covers things with hay and says they're done.

160
00:07:58,589 --> 00:07:59,931
老妈  咱能去纽约
Mom, can we go to New York 

161
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:01,722
找我以前认识的这个女孩吗
to find this girl I used to know?

162
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:02,897
巴仔  真感动
Bart, that's sweet,

163
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:05,926
但我们要买机票  花钱住旅馆
but we'd need airplane money, hotel money...

164
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:08,488
还要花500块买扬基队的票
And $500 for Yankee tickets, 

165
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,685
结果发现是假的
which turn out to be bogus.

166
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:11,066
那就别买
Well, don't buy 'em.

167
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,043
可他们要和紫袜队比赛啊
But they're playing the Purple Sox.

168
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:15,429
老爸  你爱纽约
Come on, Dad, you love New York.

169
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,012
你最不喜欢的两幢建筑
Now, that your two least favorite buildings

170
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:20,095
老潘车站和曼联体育场都被拆除了
have been obliterated: Old Penn Station and Shea Stadium.

171
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,404
早该拆了  太过时了
Lousy, outdated relics!

172
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:23,801
儿子  你记得咱上次去纽约
Boy, do you remember what happened

173
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:26,027
发生了什么事吗
the last time we went to New York?

174
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,370
离我妹妹马姬远点  不然我的手下
Keep your meat hooks off my sister Marge or my goons

175
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,087
会揍得你眼冒金星
will do a soft show on your solar plexus.

176
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:37,283
你死定了  J.J.  埋了自己去
You're dead, J.J. Get yourself buried.

177
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,310
嘴硬是吧  等着我好好收拾你
Tough cookie, huh, well, watch me take a bite out of ya.

178
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,383
我正打算带枪出去  你刚说谁来着
I'm about to go out shooting and you just said who.

179
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:42,526
你就会嘴上逞能罢了
That's some lip you got on you.

180
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:44,007
我要像撕烂像皮筋一样
How'd you like me to stretch it like a rubber band

181
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:45,349
撕烂你那张臭嘴
and snap you into last week?

182
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:49,156
你还嫩点  J.J.  真让我恶心
You're selling milk, J.J., and I got a sour stomach.

183
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:54,057
侯默  这听起来像电影《成功的滋味》
Homer, that sounds like The Sweet Smell of Success.

184
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:56,339
一点儿也不成功
It didn't feel like success.

185
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:03,401
为什么  女人们  为什么
Why, ladies? Why?!

186
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:06,218
儿子  别这么疯疯癫癫的了
Son, you can dial down the crazy.

187
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:07,908
你妈和我谈过这事了
Your mother and I talked about it,

188
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:09,759
我们找到去纽约的办法了
and we found a way to get to New York.

189
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,469
都搞定了  儿子
It's all set, boy.

190
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:14,718
为了省钱  我们交换了房子
To save money, we're swapping houses.

191
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:17,143
但别人住咱的房子  不会搞破坏吗
But don't the people wreck your house when they stay in it?

192
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:19,251
我没说交换的是咱的房子
I didn't say I swapped our house.

193
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:21,052
你好吗
Yeah, how ya doing?

194
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,807
我们来住两个礼拜
We're staying here for two weeks.

195
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,899
主上  您在测试我  对吗
Lord, you're testing me, aren't you?

196
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,305
你接着跟你上面的朋友谈吧
Yeah, keep talking to your friend up there.

197
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:27,755
我们去你床上做了
We'll be doing it on your bed.

198
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:29,757
纽约姿势
New York style.

199
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,374
看看这地方
Look at this place.

200
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,944
从我们祖先法尔沃来过以后
Things have certainly changed

201
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:47,384
变化太大了
since our ancestor Fievel came here.

202
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:49,197
法尔沃是电影里一只老鼠
Fievel was a mouse in a movie.

203
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,240
对  现在看看我们
Yes, and now look at us.

204
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,775
只有在美国才会这样
Only in America.

205
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,878
肉球球  买点肉球球吧
Khlav Kalash! Get your Khlav Kalash!

206
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:58,667
老天  又是这个人和他的傻帽小手推车
Oh, geez, not this guy with his stupid little pushcart.

207
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,843
5万平方英尺  全是肉球球
50,000 square feet, huh? All Khlav Kalash!

208
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:03,375
以前是书店
Used to be bookstore.

209
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,332
书
Books.

210
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:06,793
走吧  去找玛丽
Come on, let's go find Mary.

211
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:08,813
{\an8}河边某街道533号

212
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:08,794
这是她弟弟给我的地址
This is the address her brother gave me.

213
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,466
让爸爸带巴仔去  我们去寻觅文化吧
Can't Dad take Bart while we seek out culture?

214
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,766
你提议得好
You do that.

215
00:10:13,174 --> 00:10:15,846
你知道自己丢了衣服吗
You know you're missing your clothes?

216
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:17,585
我以为这只是做梦的
I thought this was just a dream.

217
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:18,995
天啊
Oh, man!

218
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,004
算了  还是打车吧
All right, I'll spring for a cab.

219
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:31,380
好多了
Much better.

220
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,240
到了
Here we are.

221
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,826
车上落下东西就再也找不回来了
Anything you leave in a cab you'll never see again.

222
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:45,786
谢天谢地  你醒了
Oh, uh, oh, thank God you woke up.

223
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:53,864
我看我注定无法找到真爱了
Oh, I guess my search for true love is doomed.

224
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:56,560
你学到了人生非常重要的一课  儿子
You've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy.

225
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,558
男人和女人结婚后
Which is that love doesn't exist,

226
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:02,357
爱情就不存在了
except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage.

227
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:05,362
结婚后  你只是和一个恨你的人生活
After that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of

228
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:08,733
却不能一走了之
hates you but you can't get it together to leave.

229
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,141
我去买点冰激凌
I'll get us some ice cream.

230
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:15,442
发生什么事了  亲爱的
What's the matter, darling?

231
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,942
谢谢关心  公爵夫人
Thanks for asking, Duchess.

232
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,109
我在等一个再也不会出现的女孩
I'm sitting here waiting for a girl that's never gonna show up.

233
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,652
你为什么这么肯定
What makes you so sure?

234
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:22,801
女孩子都不喜欢我
Girls don't like me.

235
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:25,366
我其实也不喜欢他们  但我将来会
I don't really like them yet either, but I think I'm gonna.

236
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,148
会有一场风暴到来的
There's a storm a-brewing down there.

237
00:11:27,148 --> 00:11:29,688
会有一位女孩站在这里的
Well, there's a girl a-standin' right here.

238
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,175
是我  玛丽
It's me, Mary.

239
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,863
你靠什么挣钱
Wow, what are you doing for money?

240
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:37,357
不是很稳定  我不好意思说
Well, it's not very steady and I'm kind of ashamed.

241
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,886
我是周六晚间直播的一个特色演员
I'm a featured player on Saturday Night Live.

242
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,441
玛丽・斯帕科勒
Mary Spuckler!

243
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:43,997
我撒谎了
Aw, I'm lying.

244
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:46,066
我在这里的生活全部都是谎言
My whole life here is a bunch of lies.

245
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:48,677
我只是个兼职表演的作家
I'm just a writer with a performing option.

246
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:50,969
我们谈点别的
Let's talk about something else.

247
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:52,439
好的事情
Something nice.

248
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,215
{\an8}爸爸比亚
故事还在继续  阿巴乐队的曲子有的是

249
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:58,308
这是我们能负担的全部了
So, this is basically what we can afford.

250
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:01,318
二号楼座  部分视线被遮挡
Okay, second balcony, partially obstructed view,

251
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:03,781
先说好  没有使用洗手间的特权
no bathroom privileges and you must stipulate that,

252
00:12:03,781 --> 00:12:05,751
如有紧急  你们可以换个探照灯外壳
in emergencies, you can change a spotlight shell.

253
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:08,750
至少我可以说来过百老汇看节目了
Well, at least I'll be able to say I went to a Broadway show.

254
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,198
不允许你那么说
You're not allowed to say that.

255
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:11,765
算了
Oh, forget it.

256
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,596
巴仔・辛普森  你真的是
So, Bart Simpson, did you really come

257
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,520
专门来看我的吗
all the way here just to see me?

258
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,471
对
Yeah.

259
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,348
另外  我认为我能
Plus, I thought I might get

260
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:21,328
看到空调外机砸中某个人的脑袋
to see an air conditioner fall on someone's head.

261
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:23,320
也可能永远看不到
But I guess that never really...

262
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:25,787
那是谁  是你爸爸吗
Ow! What was that?! Is that your father?

263
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,274
巴仔  我想再看到你
Bart, I want to see you again,

264
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:29,624
但我不想被大人抓回去
but I don't want a grownup taking me back.

265
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:31,789
明天高架公园见
Meet me at the high line tomorrow.

266
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,689
替我保密
Keep my secret!

267
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:36,480
你这个小坏蛋
You little!

268
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,209
冰激凌哪里去了
Where's that ice cream?!

269
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:39,986
我曾希望你们的父亲
Just once, I'd like your father

270
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:42,390
能因为好事出现在超大屏幕上
to be on a jumbotron for something good.

271
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,746
去你的小细脖子
Damn you and your fluted neck!

272
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:50,276
你把你老爸怎么了
So, what did you do with your dad?

273
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:53,183
得爬楼梯到这里  所以我们很安全
We're safe because you have to climb steps to get up here.

274
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,236
不能动了吗
Can't move?

275
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:57,457
不能
No.

276
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:01,918
我以为在纽约再也没有犯罪了
I thought there was no crime in New York anymore.

277
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:04,598
朱利安尼你个骗子
Giuliani!

278
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:06,375
告诉我点春田镇的事情
