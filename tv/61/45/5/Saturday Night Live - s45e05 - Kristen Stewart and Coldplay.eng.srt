1
00:00:02,818 --> 00:00:05,902
>>> HELLO, IOWA.

2
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:11,700
THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT TODAY.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,969
NOW LET'S GIVE A BIG, WARM, IOWA WELCOME

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,323
TO THE LADY OF THE HOUR
AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MAYBE,

5
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:22,224
SENATOR
ELIZABETH WARREN.

6
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,578
YEAH.
YEAH.

7
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:39,014
HELLO.

8
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:40,848
IT IS GOOD TO BE HERE.

9
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:43,915
LOOK AT ME, I AM IN MY NATURAL
HABITAT.

10
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:46,403
A
PUBLIC SCHOOL ON THE WEEKEND.

11
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:50,116
AND I JUST HAD THE NATURE
VALLEY BAR IN THE HALLWAY

12
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:54,100
SO I'M
JACKED UP AND READY TO POP OFF.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,906
FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO POUR ONE
OUT TO BETO O'ROURKE FOR
DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE.

14
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:02,792
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR RUNNING A GREAT CAMPAIGN

15
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:06,418
AND TO STICK
AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO CALL ME
PUNITIVE.

16
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:11,425
THAT WAS SO BAD ASS.
LET ME NOW HOW DEATH TASTES, ALL
RIGHT?

17
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:18,129
AND CONGRATULATIONS TO DONALD
TRUMP FOR
PAYING LESS TAXES BY MOVING TO FLORIDA,

18
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:22,349
OR AS HE CALLS IT,
BRINGING HIS TALENTS TO SOUTH
BEACH.

19
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,451
YOU KNOW WHERE I PAY TAXES?

20
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,419
EVERY SINGLE STATE, OUT OF
PRINCIPLE.

21
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:32,170
SO DONALD, DON'T
STAND TOO CLOSE TO AN ORANGE TREE

22
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,643
OR SOMEONE MIGHT TRY TO
PICK YOUR HEAD.

23
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:37,551
I'M FEELING SPANKY.

24
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:39,276
ALRIGHT, WHO'S GOT A QUESTION?

25
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:43,989
>> HI, I WORK FOR KAMALA HARRIS'
CAMPAIGN.
BUT I'M STILL UNDECIDED.

26
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:49,585
I'D LIKE TO KNOW, WHY DID IT
TAKE SO LONG FOR YOU TO RELEASE
YOUR PLAN TO PAY FOR MEDICARE
FOR ALL?

27
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:51,264
>> YEP, YEP, YEP.

28
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:55,712
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP HEALTH
CARE, THAT IS MY DESPOSITO.

29
00:01:55,981 --> 00:02:00,674
YOU KNOW, IN THE LAST FEW YEARS,
THE NUMBER ONE REASON FAMILIES WENT BANKRUPT

30
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:02,609
WAS BECAUSE OF HEALTH CARE COSTS,

31
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:05,218
EVEN THE
PEOPLE WHO HAD INSURANCE.

32
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:07,600
IT'S A TRICKY LITTLE CORN MAZE.

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,808
BUT WHEN BERNIE WAS
TALKING MEDICARE FOR ALL,
EVERYBODY WAS LIKE, "OH, COOL."

34
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:14,713
AND THEN THEY TURNED TO ME AND
THEY WERE LIKE, "FIX IT, MOM."

35
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:18,979
AND I DO, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE
THAT'S WHAT MOMS DO.

36
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,556
WITH DAD, YOU EAT BIRTHDAY CAKE
FOR BREAKFAST AND THEN YOU GO TO SIX FLAGS

37
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:28,102
AND THEN I HOLD YOUR
HAND WHILE YOU THROW UP IN MY
PURSE.

38
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:33,030
DADDY TAKES YOU TO SEE "BOOGIE
NIGHTS" WHEN YOU'RE TEN

39
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,201
AND THEN
I PROVIDE THE LONG, TENDER
FOLLOW UP EXPLANATIONS ABOUT SEX

40
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:40,511
AND WHETHER MARK WAHLBERG'S
PENIS IS A REALISTIC LENGTH.

41
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:43,374
IT AIN'T FUN.
BUT I WILL DO IT.

42
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:45,443
AND, NEXT QUESTION.
THANK YOU.

43
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:50,683
>> HI, I'M AN ASPIRING
BILLIONAIRE AND CURRENT STAY AT
HOME STEPDAD.

44
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:54,180
YOU'RE PULLING AHEAD OF BIDEN.
HOW DOES YOUR PLAN COMPARE TO
HIS?

45
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,425
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION.

46
00:02:56,425 --> 00:03:01,225
MY PLAN COMPARES FAVORABLY IN
THAT IT EXISTS.

47
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:08,142
NOBODY -- NOBODY ASKS BIDEN HOW
TO PAY FOR STUFF 'CAUSE HIS
PLANS ARE SO VAGUE.

48
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:12,709
NOBODY ASKS HOW WE'RE GOING TO
PAY FOR REMEMBER OBAMA.

49
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:15,918
BIDEN -- BIDEN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO PAY FOR STUFF.

50
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:20,955
HE JUST PUTS DOWN A $1000 DOLLAR
BILL ON THE AMTRAK DINING CAR
EVERY FEW MONTHS.

51
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,941
OKAY, SO HERE'S MY PLAN.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

52
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:28,561
OKAY.
SO FIRST OFF, WE'RE GOING TO CUT
MILITARY SPENDING.

53
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:31,759
SO IMMEDIATELY DEAD IN THE
WATER.

54
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:39,991
TWO, JEFF BEZOS WILL GO FROM
PAYING NO TAX TO A TAX.

55
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:44,449
MR. BEZOS, THE GOVERNMENT IS A
LITTLE LIKE AMAZON PRIME.

56
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:49,483
TO REAP THE BENEFITS, YOU'VE GOT
TO PAY AN ANNUAL FEE AND THAT'S
CALLED TAXES.

57
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:54,327
AND UNLIKE YOU, WE CAN'T JUST
TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR DEBIT CARD
WITHOUT WARNING.

58
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:57,399
AND SORRY.

59
00:03:57,399 --> 00:04:01,046
BANKS, I'M GOING TO TAX THE
BANKS.

60
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:02,686
DUH.

61
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:06,543
WHAT DID YOU THINK I WAS GOING
TO SAY, HOLD UP A GAS STATION?

62
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:10,832
THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT AND
NOT ONE PENNY FROM THE MIDDLE
CLASS.

63
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:16,081
WE JUST GOT TO CONVINCE JP MORGAN TO OPERATE LIKE A
NONPROFIT.

64
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,784
OKAY, NEXT QUESTION.

65
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:20,732
>> HI, SORRY, I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP
'CAUSE I'M ANNOYING.

66
00:04:20,732 --> 00:04:24,175
YOU SAID YOUR PLAN WOULD COST $20.5 TRILLION

67
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:27,686
BUT OTHER
ECONOMISTS HAVE SAID IT COULD
COST $34 TRILLION.

68
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:31,425
>> OKAY, I'LL STOP YOU RIGHT
THERE.
NOW WE'RE TALKING TRILLIONS.

69
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:35,627
SO WHEN THE NUMBERS ARE THIS
BIG, THEY'RE JUST PRETEND.

70
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:39,881
THEY AIN'T NO SCROOGE McDUCK
VAULT SOMEWHERE.

71
00:04:39,882 --> 00:04:43,692
EXIST

72
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:46,271
IT'S JUST A PROMISE FROM A
COMPUTER.

73
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:48,139
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY IT WAS COST

74
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:53,432
13 -- OVER --

75
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:56,854
>> SORRY, SENATOR, THAT DOESN'T
ADD UP FOR ME.

76
00:04:56,854 --> 00:04:59,894
>> YEAH?
OKAY.
YOU WANT TO SEE THE MATH?
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU RIGHT
HERE.

77
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:02,728
HERE.

78
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:08,139
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS?
I DO.

79
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,900
I CAN EXPLAIN IT TO YOU BUT YOU
WOULD DIE.

80
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,300
OKAY, NEXT QUESTION.
YEAH, YOU.

81
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,292
>> HI, I'M TERRIFIED OF THE
DOCTOR.
AND MY HUSBAND IS ONE.

82
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,023
BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE PROBLEM.

83
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:23,643
MY QUESTION IS, HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET SWING VOTERS ON BOARD

84
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:25,954
WITH THE RADICAL IDEA LIKE
UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE?

85
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:29,634
>> OOH, WAY TO SUBTLY ASK IF I'M
ELECTABLE.

86
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:32,177
CAREFUL, THAT'S MY KINK.

87
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:37,035
OKAY, SEE LOOK.
YOU KNOW WHY LOBBYISTS ARE SO
AGAINST UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE?

88
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:40,651
THEY'RE AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO
LIKE IT.
CAUSE IT'S AWESOME.

89
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:44,741
IN "FOOTLOOSE" THEY BANNED
DANCING.
THEY DIDN'T BAN BROCCOLI.

90
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:48,241
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, PEOPLE ARE
AFRAID OF CHANGE.

91
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:52,466
THEY ONLY LIKE THEIR CURRENT
INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT IT IS,

92
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:53,737
NOT 'CAUSE IT'S
GOOD.

93
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:58,588
SOMETHING SEEMS SCARY UNTIL YOU
TRY 'EM OUT AND FIND THAT THEY'RE GREAT,

94
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:01,392
LIKE SUSHI, OR
BUTT STUFF.

95
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:03,475
OKAY, NEXT QUESTION.

96
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:06,717
>> HI, SENATOR.
MY CURRENT INSURANCE ISN'T
PERFECT.

97
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:09,064
BUT WITH YOUR PLAN I'D HAVE TO GIVE IT UP,

98
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:11,099
AND THAT MAKES ME
NERVOUS.

99
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:14,400
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I HEAR THIS
FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,113
LET ME HELP YOU UNDERSTAND.

101
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:18,708
YOUR INSURANCE IS
LIKE A BAD BOYFRIEND.

102
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:23,110
GIRL, LISTEN TO ME.
YOU NEED TO LEAVE HIM.

103
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,729
HE'S DRAINING YOU.
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

104
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:28,755
DUMP HIS ASS.

105
00:06:29,524 --> 00:06:33,316
>> I KNOW.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

106
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:37,160
I'M SETTLING.
BUT I'M JUST SCARED TO LEAVE.

107
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,771
BECAUSE WHAT IF IT'S THE BEST I
CAN GET?

108
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:43,410
>> GIRLFRIEND, HOW MUCH IS YOUR
DEDUCTIBLE?

109
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,757
>> $8,000.
I DON'T EVEN HAVE DENTAL.

110
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,592
MY TEETH HURT SO BAD.

111
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:53,469
>> ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN TO ME, YOU BEAUTIFUL --

112
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:57,412
YOU'RE GOING TO CALL HIM.
YOU'RE GOING TO END IT.

113
00:06:57,412 --> 00:06:59,862
AND I'M GOING TO COME RIGHT OVER
WITH AN APPLE STRUDEL.

114
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:02,840
AND WE'RE GOING TO POST UP ON
THE COUCH AND WATCH MY FAVORITE SHOW

115
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,494
WHICH IS SOMEHOW "BALLERS."

116
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:10,174
AND THEN ONE DAY, BLUE CROSS
BLUE SHIELD'S GOING TO TEXT YOU FROM THE CLUB SAYING,

117
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:11,800
"BABY, I
MISS YOU."

118
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,177
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "NEW
PHONE, WHO DIS?"

119
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:18,279
OKAY, GIRLFRIEND, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.

120
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,756
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
>> YES.

121
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:23,749
>> SO DO I HAVE YOUR VOTE?

122
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:27,121
>> I DON'T KNOW.
PETE BUTTIGIEG SEEMS NICE.

123
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:28,248
>> OH, GO TO HELL.

124
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,864
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

125
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,779
MUSICAL GUEST --
COLDPLAY.

126
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:15,852
AND YOUR HOST --
KRISTEN STEWART.

127
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:25,000
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
KRISTEN STEWART!

128
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:46,786
I AM SO STOKED TO BE HOSTING
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

129
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,206
I'M GOING TO REAL WITH YOU ALL,

130
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:56,310
I DON'T FEEL TOTALLY COMFY
STANDING UP HERE AND TALKING
ABOUT MYSELF.

131
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:03,439
I FEEL LIKE I DO AT THE DINNER
TABLE SOMETIMES,

132
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:07,200
"CHARLIE'S
ANGELS" IS PROBABLY THE MOST FUN
I'VE EVER HAD DOING ANYTHING

133
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,323
BUT
COULD I PLEASE BE EXCUSED NOW?

134
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:12,742
SO I THOUGHT INSTEAD OF ME JUST
TALKING UP HERE,

135
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:15,982
I WOULD DO ONE
OF THOSE AUDIENCE QUESTION
MONOLOGUES.

136
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,764
SOUND GOOD?

137
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:24,137
ALL RIGHT.
WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST?

138
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:27,046
>> HI, MY NAME IS ERIN.
I'M A HUGE FAN.

139
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:28,788
>> THANK YOU.
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

140
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:32,953
SO WOULD YOU SAY YOU'RE LIKE --
ARE YOU CLOSER WITH YOUR MOM OR
YOUR DAD?

141
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,869
>> HUH?

142
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:40,174
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR CAREER AND
STUFF.

143
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,813
>> I ALREADY KNOW THOSE ANSWERS.

144
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:48,702
SO WHO DO YOU FEEL, MOM OR DAD?

145
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:51,839
>> CAN I NOT?

146
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,548

294
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,913
IT'S
THE HIGH END BRITISH PAINT
COMPANY 

295
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:39,886
THAT OFFERS UNPARALLELED
COLOR.

296
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:41,916
>> OH, NICE.

297
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:47,954
>> EACH OF THEIR 132 COLORS WORK
BEAUTIFUL IN NEW HOMES BOTH OLD
AND NEW.

298
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:51,945
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING
THE WORD COLOR BUT WITH THE "U"
IN IT.

299
00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:53,432
>> I AM.

300
00:19:53,432 --> 00:19:57,978
THAT COLOR ON THE BASEBOARD THERE

301
00:19:57,978 --> 00:20:01,188
IS NAMED AFTER THE FOSSILS
OFTEN FOUND ON THE DORSETT
COAST.

302
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:03,935
THE WALL COLOR IS Nobel blue

303
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:07,726
NAMED AFTER THE SWIRLING BRITISH MISTS.

304
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:09,734
WHAT A COLOR.

305
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:13,739
>> MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY FAIR LYNN
BALL.
>> MAYBE WE SHOULD.

306
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:17,676
IS IT EXPENSIVE?
>> WELL, IT'S PREMIUM.
YOU'RE PAYING FOR QUALITY.

307
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:22,592
>> HOW MUCH IS IT, LIKE $50 A
GALLON?
>> NO, THAT'S CRAZY, IT'S JUST
PAINT.

308
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:27,000
>> THIS IS NOT JUST PAINT.
IT'S FAIR LYNN BALL.

309
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,598
>> HOW MUCH IS IT, BETH?
$60?

310
00:20:29,598 --> 00:20:32,048
>> IT'S $110 A GALLON.

311
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:35,327
>> WHAT! $110 FOR A CAN OF PAINT,

312
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:37,676
ARE YOU
INSANE?
>> NO, I'M NOT INSANE.

313
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:40,460
>> HOW MUCH DID IT COST TO PAINT
THIS ROOM, $800?

314
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,509
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE
SPECIAL PRIMER, THE BRUSHES,

315
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,474
FACTOR IN THE SHIPPING AND THE
LABOR.

316
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:50,193
>> THEY SHIP THE PAINT?
HOW MUCH IS THAT?

317
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:54,196
>> WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST BUY IT
ANYWHERE.
LOOK AT THE DEPTH OF COLOR.

318
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:58,404
>> YOU CAN'T AFFORD THIS,
CHARLOTTE.
YOU ARE AN OUT OF WORKDAY
BARTENDER.

319
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:02,000
>> WRONG, I'M AN ASPIRING ESTATE
MANAGER.

320
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,305
>> WHAT IS AN ESTATE MANAGER?

321
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:08,023
>> SHE THINKS SHE'S GOING TO
FIND A RICH PERSON AND JUST LIVE
IN THEIR HOUSE.

322
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:13,000
YOU ARE LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD
AND YOU'VE PAINTED IT IN THAT
JACK ASS MILLION DOLLAR PAINT.

323
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,123
>> DON'T TOUCH IT!

324
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:19,531
>> YOU CAN'T TOUCH THE PAINT?
>> NO.
THE FINISH IS DELICATE.

325
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:21,795
ONCE YOU TOUCH IT, IT HAS TO BE
REDONE.

326
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:25,570
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THE MONEY
MOM LEFT YOU?
>> NO.

327
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,289
>> NO?
>> I DON'T MEAN NO.
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW.

328
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,749
>> DON'T YOU RENT THIS HOUSE?
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

329
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,608
>> IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO PAINT IT BACK WHATEVER COLOR --

330
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:38,026
NOW I'M SAYING IT.

331
00:21:38,026 --> 00:21:39,852
>> EVERYONE JUST CALM DOWN.

332
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:42,426
>> HE JUST WANTS ME TO LIVE IN
SQUALOR.

333
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,627
>> CAN YOU GUYS ALL KEEP IT DOWN
A LITTLE?
I'M TRYING TO SLEEP A LITTLE.

334
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:48,959
>> WHO IS THIS?

335
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:52,910
>> THIS IS MY FRIEND, JOHNNY.

336
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,923
>> ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH HIM?
>> OF COURSE.

337
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:59,369
WE MET ON FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE.

338
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:03,014
>> JUST A LITTLE QUIET, YOU
GUYS.

339
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:05,580
>> OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS YOUR LIFE?

340
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,380
>> BETH, WE'RE NOT MAD, JUST A
LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

341
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,693
>> OH, DON'T YOU EFFING JUDGE ME
RIGHT NOW.

342
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:18,200
>> I KNOW WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS
GOTTEN ALONG, BUT WE HAVEN'T
BEEN AROUND MUCH BECAUSE OF THE
BABY.

343
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,100
>> THE BABY'S NOT EVEN HIS.
>> WHAT?

344
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,766
>> BETH, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW, WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT FAR LYNN BALL.

345
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:31,593
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FAIR
LYNN BALL ANYMORE.

346
00:22:31,593 --> 00:22:35,227
I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT BABY
HAS YOUR TRAINER'S EYES.

347
00:22:35,227 --> 00:22:38,518
>> ARE YOU DRUNK?
>> YES!

348
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:43,392
I WAS GOOD FOR THE FIRST COUPLE
OF MINUTES BUT YES, I AM DRUNK.

349
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:45,014
NOW TELL HIM.

350
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:47,811
BETH, TELL HIM.

351
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:49,731
LOOK IN HIS EYES.

352
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:52,511
>> NO, NO, HE'S SLEEPING, DON'T
LOOK AT HIS EYES.

353
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:55,717
>> LOOK AT THE COLOR OF HIS
EYES.

354
00:22:55,717 --> 00:22:59,466
>> OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.

355
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,800
>> YOU'RE DEAD.

356
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,213
>> OH, YOU WANT TO GO, LET'S GO.

357
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:05,340
JUST DON'T BUMP INTO THE PAINT
OR YOU'LL RUIN IT.

358
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,024
>> GO FOR IT, BETH.

359
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:12,492
STORY

360
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,425
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING C-SPAN.

361
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:22,559
AT MIDNIGHT, BETO O'ROURKE ROLLS
DOWN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES IN
DEFEAT.

362
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,341
BUT, FIRST WE GO LIVE TO A PRESS
BRIEFING AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH
KELLYANNE CONWAY.

363
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:30,315
>> OKAY, GOOD EVENING.
HELLO, EVERYONE.

364
00:23:30,315 --> 00:23:32,926
IT IS I, KELLYANNE CONWAY.

365
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:37,360
AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS, YOU
ARE GOING TO DIE IN SEVEN DAYS.

366
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,751
MMM-KAY, AND AS YOU PROBABLY
NOTICED, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOT
HELD A PRESS BRIEFING IN EIGHT
MONTHS.

367
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:46,456
WE'VE KEPT THE PRESS SECRETARY IN HIDING

368
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:49,661
BECAUSE OUR PREVIOUS
ONES WERE MOCKED, HUMILIATED,

369
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,815
AND FORCED TO REGAIN THEIR
DIGNITY ON "DANCING WITH THE
STARS."

370
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:59,724
MMM-KAY, BUT TODAY I AM HERE TO
CELEBRATING BECAUSE WE HAVE KILLED THE LEADER OF ISIS,

371
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:05,357
WHICH
ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION
MEANS THE IMPEACHMENT CAN NO
LONGER LEGALLY MOVE FORWARD.

372
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:08,887
MMM-KAY, AND NOW IT IS MY
PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE A VERY
SPECIAL GUEST.

373
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:14,952
THE HERO WHO TOOK DOWN THE
LEADER OF ISIS, CONAN THE
K9 COMMANDO.

374
00:24:18,188 --> 00:24:22,918
MMM-KAY, AND HE IS JOINED BY
SPECIAL FORCES K9 INTERPRETER
DANA GRAM.

375
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:23,868
>> HELLO.

376
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:27,213
>> AND YOU CAN TRANSLATE
EVERYTHING THAT THE DOG IS
SAYING?

377
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:32,048
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
I HAVE A MASTER DEGREE IN
LINGUISTICS FROM DR. DOLITTLE
UNIVERSITY.

378
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:36,031
>> AND CONAN, THANK YOU FOR
COMING TODAY.

379
00:24:40,124 --> 00:24:44,918
>> RIGHT.
OKAY.
HE'S SAYING, "THE PLEASURE IS
ALL
MINE, KELLYANNE."

380
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:47,209
>> MMM-KAY, AND YOU HAVE THE
FLOOR.

381
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:52,403
>> THAT BLINK MEANT HE CAN'T
WAIT TO LICK IT.
>> MMM-KAY.

382
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,123
>> ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO
TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS

383
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:59,359
AND CONAN
IS GOING TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION
IN SYRIA.

384
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,642
YOU, MA'AM?

385
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:04,055
>> HI, CONAN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
SERVICE.

386
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:08,361
"IT'S MY HONOR, I DO THIS JOB FOR TWO REASONS;

387
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:12,123
ONE, I LOVE MY
COUNTRY, AND TWO, BELLY RUBS."

388
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:13,732
>> YES, I JUST WANTED TO ASK,

389
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:16,678
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?
ARE YOU A GOOD BOY?

390
00:25:16,678 --> 00:25:19,329
ARE YOU MY GOOD LITTLE BOY?

391
00:25:23,376 --> 00:25:26,304
RIGHT

392
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:32,818
>> "SERIOUSLY, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I'M A TRAINED MILITARY ASSASSIN

393
00:25:32,818 --> 00:25:35,262
NOT SOME BASIC
LABRADOODLE."

394
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:39,110
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, I APOLOGIZE.
>> "APOLOGY ACCEPTED."

395
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,572
YOU, SIR.

396
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:44,547
>> YES, YOU WERE INVOLVED IN A
TERRORIST RAID.

397
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:47,402
WAS THAT SCARY FOR YOU?

398
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:55,635
>> "A LITTLE, SURE, THE
TERRORISTS HAD GUNS AND EXPLOSIVES

399
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:57,400
BUT AT LEAST THEY
DON'T HAVE VACUUM CLEANERS.

400
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,081
YOU, MA'AM?

401
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:04,299
>> HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE
GETTING ALL THE CREDIT FOR
KILLING BAGHDADI?

402
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,131
"HONESTLY, IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT
FROM DAY ONE.

403
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:11,831
SNIFF

404
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:15,963
>> AND HOW HAS YOUR LIFE CHANGED
NOW THAT YOU'RE A HERO?

405
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:21,600
HONESTLY, I'M DROWNING IN"
BITCHES."

406
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,660
YOU

407
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,342
>> WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE
SO-CALLED WHISTLE-BLOWER IN THE
WHITE HOUSE?

408
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:35,575
>> "I THINK WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO THE WHISTLE-BLOWER IS

409
00:26:35,575 --> 00:26:37,919
BECAUSE THAT SOUND IS DRIVING
HIM CRAZY."

410
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,689
NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE.

411
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:47,298
WAIT, ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO HAVE
A SIP OF WATER, I THINK.

412
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:50,067
YOU, MA'AM.

413
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:54,700
>> I WAS JUST ON DOG TWITTER

414
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,015
AND READING SOME STORIES ABOUT YOU.
ARE ANY OF THEM TRUE?

415
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:06,449
>> HE SAYS, "I SHOULD COME CLEAN
ABOUT SOMETHING.

416
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:11,511
TEN YEARS AGO AT A HALLOWEEN
PARTY I DRESSED UP AS A CAT.

417
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:16,335
I DID NOT MEAN TO APPROPRIATE
FELINE CULTURE OR PUT ON
CATFACE.

418
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:21,963
I ALSO APOLOGIZE FOR LAST
HALLOWEEN WHEN I DRESSED AS A
CHOCOLATE LAB."

419
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:27,631
>> OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
VIDEO OF YOU THAT'S JUST COME
OUT?

420
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:32,239
>> "OH, RIGHT, THERE'S A VIDEO
OF ME BARKING AT A BLACKMAILMAN.

421
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:34,565
I SWEAR IT WASN'T ABOUT RACE.

422
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:39,371
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE COLOR.
LITERALLY I'M COLOR-BLIND.

423
00:27:41,111 --> 00:27:46,545
OH, AND EVERY DAY FOR THE PAST
12 YEARS I'VE HUMPED SOMEONE'S
LEG WITHOUT CONSENT.

424
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:48,820
FOR THAT I APOLOGIZE."

425
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:54,450
>> IF I COULD THROW IN A SILLY
QUESTION, WHO DO YOU THINK WON
HALLOWEEN?

426
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,420
>> "TO ME, HEIDI KLUM ALWAYS WINS HALLOWEEN

427
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,059
BUT THIS YEAR I
HAVE TO GO WITH KYLIE JENNER,
SHE BECAME MARILYN.

428
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:10,802
AND SPEAKING OF COSTUMES, WHAT
IS THIS JUNKY FAKE MEDAL THAT THE PRESIDENT PUT ON MY NECK,

429
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,681
IT
HAS A PICTURE OF A PAW ON IT.

430
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:16,736
YOU DON'T GIVE HUMANS A MEDAL
WITH A FOOT ON IT."

431
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,600
"ANYWAY, THAT'S MY TIME, GOD
BLESS AMERICA,

432
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,744
SCOOTER, IF
YOU'RE WATCHING, DADDY LOVES
YOU, NOW GO TO BED.

433
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:34,530
AND THE SAME GOES FOR PICKLE,

THAT TRUMP
RAISED TAXES FOR NEW YORKERS AND
THEN LEFT NEW YORK.

VERY BADLY.

551
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:39,454
ESPECIALLY ONE NEW YORK
POLITICIAN WHO HAS BEEN ACTIVELY
DESTROYING HIS LIFE.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY ON THURSDAY.

564
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,522

THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NOT TO
VOTE ON RESOLUTIONS,

565
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:32,049
NANCY PELOSI DID VOTE YES TO
MAKE A POINT.

566

BUT I THINK SHE WENT A LITTLE
TOO FAR WHEN SHE CELEBRATED
WORLD CUP STYLE.

00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:42,600
BETO O'ROURKE ANNOUNCED HE'S

PRESIDENTE.

BIGGEST STORY OF THE WEEK.

571
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:58,237

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

572
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,942

WORTH OF AVOCADOS.

573
00:38:00,942 --> 00:38:03,263
WHITE WOMEN ARE DEVASTATED.

574
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:08,127
THE STATE IS ALLOWING
NONVIOLENT PRISONERS IN
CALIFORNIA TO HELP
FIGHT THE WILDFIRES.

575
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:12,963
VIOLENT

CYBERSECURITY ADVISER IN 2017,

GIULIANI WENT TO AN APPLE STORE FOR HELP

583
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,700
AFTER HE ENTERED THE
WRONG PASSWORD IN HIS PHONE
10 TIMES AND PERMANENTLY LOCKED
HIMSELF OUT.

584
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,754
EVEN WORSE, HE WENT TO THIS
APPLE STORE.

iPHONE WOULDN'T UNLOCK,

586

EVEN APPLE'S FACE I.D. DOESN'T
RECOGNIZE THE MAN RUDY HAS
BECOME.

CLAIMING THAT HIS DEATH WAS NOT
A SUICIDE, BUT THAT HE WAS
MURDERED.

589
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:18,179
THAT COSTS US 250 GRAND.

590
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,000

CONSPIRACY THEORY FOR THIS
DEATH.

EVERYTHING BUT THE TRUTH,

594

WHO HAD A THREE WAY RELATIONSHIP
WITH HILL AND HER FORMER
HUSBAND.

597
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:51,405

TAKE A HALF STEP AND
GO PESCATARIAN WITH OUR COAST
TASTER BASKET.

717
00:47:37,422 --> 00:47:40,070
>> OH, YUM.

718
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:43,597
LOOK AT THESE DEAD
LITTLE SWIMMERS.

719
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:48,853
>> OH, COLIN, LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THE SHEEN ON THERE.

720
00:47:48,853 --> 00:47:51,097
>> I SEE THE SHEEN, YEAH.

721
00:47:51,097 --> 00:47:54,647
>> WELL, GOOD, THAT'S HOW YOU
KNOW IT'S WET.

722
00:47:55,525 --> 00:48:01,292
>> AND YOU KNOW OUR FISH GOT
GOOD FLAVOR BECAUSE IT GLISTENS
AND STINKS.

723
00:48:01,894 --> 00:48:03,702
>> HEY, LISTEN.

724
00:48:03,702 --> 00:48:06,622
FISH ARE BARELY ANIMALS, OKAY?

725
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:11,727
THEY'RE STUPID AND THEY CAN'T
EVEN HUG.

726
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:17,418
LIKE THIS ALASKAN KING CRAB
HERE, WHO REFUSED TO WEAR A CONDOM

727
00:48:17,418 --> 00:48:21,113
BECAUSE HE SAYS IT MESSES
WITH HIS FLOW.

728
00:48:21,113 --> 00:48:26,466
NOW, GO AHEAD AND DUNK HIS ASS
IN BUTTER AND SUCK THE MEAT OUT.

729
00:48:28,912 --> 00:48:34,653
>> THIS TENDER FLOUNDER IS AS
FLAT AS HE THOUGHT THE EARTH
WAS.

730
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:39,543
NOW, THIS -- THIS EEL.
THIS EEL DOESN'T GO DOWN.

731
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:44,194
BUT IT EXPECTS YOU TO.
NOW, HOW DOES THAT WORK?

732
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:48,930
NOW YOU CAN EAT HIS WHOLE DANG
BEAUTIFUL SMELLY BODY

733
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,133
WITH A SQUEEZE OF LEMON.

734
00:48:51,133 --> 00:48:54,322
>> THIS OYSTER'S WHOLE BODY IS
SNOT.

735
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:57,942
AND IF YOU EAT IT, HE MAKES YOU
FEEL FRISKY.

736
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,815
>> NOW, ARE YOU FEELING FRISKY,
COLIN?

737
00:49:01,815 --> 00:49:05,003
>> ARE WE KIND OF GETTING YOU
HOT OVER HERE, COLIN?

738
00:49:05,003 --> 00:49:07,982
>> NO, I ACTUALLY FEEL KIND OF
SICK.

739
00:49:07,982 --> 00:49:11,841
>> YEAH, WELL THAT'S PART OF IT,
SWEETHEART.

740
00:49:11,841 --> 00:49:14,981
>> I'M SORRY, BUT NONE OF THESE
STORIES SOUND LIKE THEY'RE REAL.

741
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:19,328
>> YOU A BIG FISH BOY, COLIN?
- No.

742
00:49:19,328 --> 00:49:22,003
>> YOU A COD LICKER?

743
00:49:23,152 --> 00:49:25,727
>> YOU CUCKOO FOR COD, BABY?

744
00:49:25,727 --> 00:49:28,431
CHE

745
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:31,026
>> IT'S SO BAD EVEN FOR ME.

746
00:49:31,026 --> 00:49:34,779
>> VANETA AND WYLENE, EVERYONE.

747
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:39,273
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE" I'M
COLIN JOST.
>> I'M MICHAEL CHE.
GOODNIGHT.

748
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:50,823
>>> OKAY, WELL, THAT'S SIX VOTES
FOR INNOCENT AND SIX VOTES FOR
GUILTY.

749
00:49:50,823 --> 00:49:53,536
>> GREAT, SO WE'RE STILL
DEADLOCKED?

750
00:49:53,536 --> 00:49:56,233
>> DAMNIT.
>> WE ARE NEVER GETTING OUT OF
HERE.

751
00:49:56,233 --> 00:49:59,811
>> I KNOW.
HOW DOES ANYBODY STILL THINK
THIS GUY IS INNOCENT?

752
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:02,168
>> WELL, I BET YOU'D UNDERSTAND
IF HE WAS A WHITE MAN.

753
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:05,208
>> AND HERE WE GO WITH THE RACE
CARD.

754
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:08,514
>> OKAY GUYS, CAN WE PLEASE NOT
GO THERE AGAIN?

755
00:50:08,514 --> 00:50:11,970
>> ALL RIGHT.
JUDGE WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'RE
CLOSE TO A VERDICT.

756
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:15,803
>> NO.
WE'RE STILL DELIBERATING AND I'M
STARVING.

757
00:50:15,803 --> 00:50:18,900
>> WELL, WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T
EATEN.
CAN WE GET SOME FOOD, MAYBE?

758
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,493
>> NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT A WAITER.
I'M A BAILIFT.

759
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:25,421
SO, LET ME KNOW WHEN YA'LL ARE
DONE.

760
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:28,073
>> DID HE SAY "BAILIFT" WITH A
T?

761
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:33,220
>> WHO CARES, MY FRIGGIN'
STOMACH IS LITERALLY DOING FLIPS
RIGHT NOW.

762
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,200
>> YEAH, MINE TOO.

763
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,192
>> OKAY, WELL, SORRY.
IF A MAN'S FREEDOM IS GETTING IN
THE WAY OF YOUR DINNER PLANS.

764
00:50:38,192 --> 00:50:41,200
>> YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE
MEANT.

765
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,329
>> ALL I'M SAYING IS IF THE
DEFENDANT WAS WHITE, YOU MIGHT
HAVE BELIEVED HIS STORY.

766
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:46,245
>> HE'S RIGHT.

767
00:50:46,245 --> 00:50:49,292
>> OH, COME ON, RACE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

768
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:51,775
>> OH, OKAY, BUT --

769
00:50:54,282 --> 00:50:58,057
WHAT WAS THAT?
>> SORRY, THAT WAS ACTUALLY MY
STOMACH.

770
00:50:58,057 --> 00:51:00,732
>> DAMN.
THAT WAS LOUD.

771
00:51:00,732 --> 00:51:04,099
>> AND I TOLD YOU, MY STOMACH IS
UPSET.
I GOT TO EAT SOMETHING.

772
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:06,630
>> HOW CAN YOU SAY RACE HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS?

773
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:10,499
THEY PULLED HIM OVER WITHOUT
CAUSE.
>> HE WAS SPEEDING.

774
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,030
SORRY.

775
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:17,002
>> DO YOU WANT A TUMS OR
SOMETHING, JO?
>> NO, I NEED A MEAL.

776
00:51:17,002 --> 00:51:19,173
>> OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT
LAST WITNESS?

777
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:24,023
>> OH, SHE WAS CLEARLY LYING.
>> SHE CHANGED HER STORY, LIKE
THREE TIMES.

778
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:28,458
>> ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?
>> THAT ONE WASN'T ME.

779
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:31,875
>> I'M SORRY.
I THINK THAT WAS MY STOMACH THAT
TIME.

780
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:34,600
>> OKAY.
WHY WOULD THAT WITNESS HAVE ANY
REASON TO LIE?

781
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,978
>> EXACTLY.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY --

782
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,847
I GUESS I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY TOO.

783
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,110
>> DO YOU NEED A TUMS?

784
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:46,177
>> OH, WE REALLY NEED TO GET OUT
OF HERE.

785
00:51:46,177 --> 00:51:49,848
>> YOU KNOW, IF I DON'T GET TO
EAT SOMETHING SOON, I --

786
00:51:49,848 --> 00:51:52,220
AND THAT ONE WAS MINE AGAIN.

787
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,920
>> WELL, COULD YOU PLEASE QUIET
YOUR STOMACH UP?
>> OBVIOUSLY NOT.

788
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,714
IT'S INVOLUNTARY, OKAY?
>> SO JUST TAKE A TUMS.

789
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:01,437
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

790
00:52:01,437 --> 00:52:04,753
OH, I WILL TAKE A TUMS,
ACTUALLY.

791
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:07,123
>> OH, I DON'T HAVE ANY TUMS.

792
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:11,400
>> WHY DID YOU KEEP OFFERING
THEM?
>> I WAS OFFERING ADVICE.

793
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,974
>> SORRY.

794
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,644
>> I'M SORRY.

795
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,638
PARDON ME.

796
00:52:20,611 --> 00:52:23,788
>> ALL RIGHT.
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO CHANGE
THEIR VOTE?

797
00:52:24,362 --> 00:52:26,454
ANYBODY?

798
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:36,491
>> COME ON, MAN, Y'ALL CAN'T
HEAR THAT?
>> HEAR WHAT?

799
00:52:37,425 --> 00:52:40,189
>> OKAY, FINE, I'LL CHANGE MY
VOTE.

800
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:42,543
>> THEN, I CHANGE MY VOTE TOO.

801
00:52:42,543 --> 00:52:46,152
>> WHAT?
THAT JUST BRINGS US BACK TO A

802
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:49,528
>> I KNOW, BUT I WANT TO HEAR

843
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:21,688

THANK YOU

903
01:00:59,968 --> 01:01:04,209
>> ALL RIGHT, FOLKS, I KNOW THE
STARGAZING HIKE HAS BEEN LONG.

904
01:01:04,209 --> 01:01:06,674
>> AND FUNNY AS HELL.
>> YEAH, WE LOVE THIS STUFF.

905
01:01:06,674 --> 01:01:08,719
>> AND I LOVE THIS ENERGY.

906
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:11,963
BUT HOW ABOUT THIS VIEW?
>> NOT BAD, HUH?

907
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:16,087
>> OH, YEAH, THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL
SPOT.
YOU CAN SEE SO MUCH OF THE SKY.

908
01:01:16,087 --> 01:01:19,194
>> EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS SPOT SO
SPECIAL.

909
01:01:19,194 --> 01:01:21,806
YOU CAN SEE SO MANY
CONSTELLATIONS.

910
01:01:21,806 --> 01:01:23,963
SO, LET'S CHECK IT OUT, OKAY?

911
01:01:26,323 --> 01:01:29,067
WHAT A MARVELOUS VIEW.

912
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:32,737
I CAN ALREADY SEE SOME OF MY
FAVORITES.

913
01:01:32,737 --> 01:01:36,288
>> WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD AN
ASTRONOMY BUFF IN THE GROUP.

914
01:01:36,288 --> 01:01:38,078
>> ROLLINS WAS IN THE NAVY.

915
01:01:38,078 --> 01:01:42,408
HE SAYS HE ALWAYS LOVES TO SLEEP
ON THE DECK UNDER THE STARS.

916
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:45,120
>> WOW, YEAH, I BET THAT WAS
QUITE THE VIEW.

917
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,074
>> OH, IT WAS.
WE SAW SO MUCH IN THAT NIGHT
SKY.

918
01:01:49,074 --> 01:01:51,335
>> HEY, CAN WE SEE THE BIG
DIPPER FROM HERE?

919
01:01:51,335 --> 01:01:54,073
>> YEAH, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO
POINT THAT OUT.

920
01:01:54,073 --> 01:01:57,327
JUST FOLLOW MY FINGER, GUYS.

921
01:01:58,044 --> 01:02:02,235
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT'S AMAZING.
I LOVE THE CONSTELLATIONS.

922
01:02:02,235 --> 01:02:05,022
>> YEAH, YEAH, THE UNIVERSE IS
JUST SO AMAZING.

923
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:09,910
>> AND LOOK HERE, YOUNG MAN.
LET ME SHOW YOU THE LITTLE
DIPPER.

924
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:14,192
VERY COOL.
THANK YOU, SIR.

925
01:02:14,192 --> 01:02:20,259
>> IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY, YOU SEE
THAT THE TWO DIPPERS TEACH THE
GOLDEN RULE.

926
01:02:20,259 --> 01:02:22,695
>> REALLY, I'VE NEVER HEARD
THAT.

927
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:25,829
>> YEAH, HOW DID THEY TEACH THE
GOLDEN RULE?

928
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:30,302
>> GOLDEN RULE, TREAT OTHERS HOW
WE WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED,

929
01:02:30,302 --> 01:02:32,052
SEE?

930
01:02:35,814 --> 01:02:40,006
AND SEE, THEY'RE SERVICING EACH
OTHER.

931
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:43,449
>> OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT -- IS THAT SUPPOSED TO
BE --

932
01:02:43,449 --> 01:02:46,689
>> DOUBLE SIMULTANEOUS ORAL,
YES.

933
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,468
>> GROSS.
THE DIPPERS AREN'T DOING THAT.

934
01:02:49,468 --> 01:02:53,371
>> OH, YES, THEY ARE.
AND THEY HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE I
WAS A GIRL.

935
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:55,880
>> YEAH, I MEAN, WHAT DO THEY
EVEN TEACH KIDS ANYMORE?

936
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:00,237
>> WELL, DEFINITELY NOT THAT THE
DIPPERS ARE SERVICING EACH
OTHER.

937
01:03:00,237 --> 01:03:03,364
>> BOO, CRUDE VERSION.

938
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:06,031
>> THAT'S ENOUGH WITH THE
DIPPERS, I THINK, OKAY?

939
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:08,408
>> YEAH, YEAH, WHY DON'T WE LOOK
AT SOMETHING ELSE?

940
01:03:08,408 --> 01:03:13,559
>> YEAH, WELL, IF YOU LOOK HERE,
I'LL SHOW YOU THE CONSTELLATION
LEO.

941
01:03:14,492 --> 01:03:16,937
YOU GUYS SEE THE LION?

942
01:03:17,147 --> 01:03:21,868
>> YES, YES.
BUT IF WE LOOK CLOSER WE CAN
LEARN A VALUABLE LESSON HERE.

943
01:03:21,868 --> 01:03:26,731
>> THE GREATEST JOY IN LIFE
COMES FROM HELPING A FRIEND IN
NEED.

944
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:30,661
>> OH, MY GOD.
GUYS, COME ON, THAT'S
DISGUSTING.

945
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:35,066
>> DISGUSTING?
SUCKS TO BE HIS WIFE.

946
01:03:35,066 --> 01:03:39,585
>> WELL, I'M NOT MARRIED.
>> OH, I THINK I KNOW WHY.

947
01:03:40,235 --> 01:03:43,588
>> YOU DON'T GO DOWN.
AM I RIGHT, LADIES?

948
01:03:43,588 --> 01:03:47,115
>> OH, OH, NO.
WE'RE MORE LIKE HIM THAN YOU,

949
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:52,591
>> OH, LOOK.
I SEE SCORPIUS RIGHT OVER THERE.

950
01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:56,831
>> YEAH, THAT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT.
YOU GUYS SEE HOW IT'S A
SCORPION?

951
01:03:56,831 --> 01:04:00,048
>> OH, I SEE MUCH MORE THAN
THAT.

952
01:04:00,676 --> 01:04:03,310
>> OH, PLEASE DON'T.
THIS ONE'S MY FAVORITE.

953
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:08,423
>> MINE TOO, SEE?
IT TEACHES AN IMPORTANT LESSON

954
01:04:08,423 --> 01:04:11,866
ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF
PARTNERSHIP.

955
01:04:11,866 --> 01:04:17,057
>> IS THAT --
>> A MAN TRYING TO REACH
HIMSELF, YES.

956
01:04:17,057 --> 01:04:20,855
>> WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH THE STRENGTH OF
PARTNERSHIP?

957
01:04:20,855 --> 01:04:27,185
>> BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW HARD A
MAN TRIES, HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO REACH HIMSELF.

958
01:04:27,185 --> 01:04:31,253
FOR THAT KIND OF SATISFACTION,
YOU NEED A PARTNER.

959
01:04:31,253 --> 01:04:35,456
>> WELL, THIS SUCKS.
CONSTELLATIONS ARE WHAT I LIVE
FOR.

960
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:37,586
AND YOU HORNY OLD FREAKS HAVE
RUINED IT.

961
01:04:37,586 --> 01:04:42,060
>> YEAH, YOU GUYS JUST LOOK UP
AT NIGHT AND PERV OUT ON THE
STARS?

962
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,146
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
FOR.

963
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:48,713
>> YOU SEE, IN OUR DAY THERE WAS
NO INTERNET TO SATIATE OUR
HORNS.

964
01:04:48,713 --> 01:04:51,569
>> WE HAD TO PROJECT OUR
FANTASIES ONTO THE STARS.

965
01:04:51,569 --> 01:04:56,633
>> YES.
WE'D GO OUTSIDE AS A GROUP AND
STARE AT THE STARS UNTIL
EVERYONE SCREAMED.

966
01:04:56,633 --> 01:05:00,995
>> SWEET HUSBAND, I -- I WANT TO
SCREAM AT THE STARS RIGHT NOW.

967
01:05:00,995 --> 01:05:03,277
>> I WANT TO HELP YOU SCREAM AT
THE STARS.

968
01:05:03,277 --> 01:05:06,689
>> WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?

969
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:12,085
>> RIGHT HERE?
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE THAT.

970
01:05:27,418 --> 01:05:29,621
>>> HEY, WHAT'S UP,

971
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:31,783
THANK YOU, COLDPLAY.

972
01:05:34,015 --> 01:05:37,378
I TOLD YOU IT WAS GOING TO BE
TIGHT.

973
01:05:37,378 --> 01:05:40,123
THAT'S IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
