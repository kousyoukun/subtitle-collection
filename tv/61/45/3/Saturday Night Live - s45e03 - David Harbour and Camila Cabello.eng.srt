00:00:02,815 --> 00:00:06,538
LAST ONE STANDING GETS THE OH,
SO, ILLUSIVE GAY VOTE.

3
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:11,966
IT'S THE CNN TOWN HALL
EQUALITY IN AMERICA WITH
ANDERSON COOPER.

4
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:23,200
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M ANDERSON COOPER.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,484
THIS TOWN HALL WILL DISCUSS
THE ISSUES AFFECTING OUR COMMUNITY.

6
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:30,640
LGBTQ AND STRAIGHT GIRLS
THAT MAKE PRIDE ABOUT THEM.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,108
AND SINCE WE'LL NEVER DO
THIS AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT

20
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:25,531
>> HI SENATOR. MY QUESTION IS,

21
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,300
HAVE YOU ALWAYS
BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE GAY
COMMUNITY?

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,611
>> ABSOLUTELY, YES I HAVE
NOTHING BUT RESPECT SINCE DAY
ONE.

23
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:37,369
>> BUT-- BUT IN 1992 ‐‐
>> UH‐OH.

24
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:42,620
>> YOU PUBLISHED AN OP‐ED WHERE
YOU SAID SOME VERY DEROGATORY
THINGS ABOUT THE GAY COMMUNITY.

25
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,382
>> NOW, I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I'M
DODGING THE QUESTION.

26
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:50,779
SO I'M GOING TO GO NOW.

27
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:55,125
>> OUR NEXT CANDIDATE
IS PLAYING WITH A
HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE.

28

>> YES, REPRESENTING
HOUSE OF BOOTY-GIG IT'S...

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,937
MAYOR PETE!

30
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:11,067
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.

31
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:15,311
I ‐‐ I WENT TO HARVARD, BUT THEY
DON'T TEACH YOU WHERE TO PUT
YOUR ARMS.

32
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:18,105
>> OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM
DANIEL.

33
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:23,239
>> YEAH.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THOSE WHO
SAY YOU'RE NOT GAY IN THE RIGHT
WAY?

34
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,163
>> YOU KNOW, I'VE HEARD THAT,
BUT THERE'S NO
WRONG WAY TO BE GAY.

35
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:31,228
UNLESS YOU'RE ELLEN THIS WEEK.

36
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:34,699
>> ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

37
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:37,202
>> OH. YOU KNOW,
ACTUALLY, ANDERSON, I HAVE ONE.

38
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:39,920
WHY AM I NOT WINNING THIS?
YOU KNOW?

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,672
I'M A VETERAN, I'M UNDER THE
LEGAL RETIREMENT AGE

40
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:46,072
AND WHEN I
TALK IT MAKES SENSE.

41
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:48,047
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME

42
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:53,624
>> NO ‐‐ NO.
YOU'RE GREAT GUY, JUST LIKE, AS
A FRIEND, NOT FOR PRESIDENT.

43
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:55,584
>> OH. OK.
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

44
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:59,046
>> CAN I CALL YOU AN UBER?
>> OH NO.
I DROVE.

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,564
>> WELL, I HOPE YOU DIDN'T FILL UP ON SNACKS,

46
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:14,000
BECAUSE NOW IT'S
TIME FOR THE MEAT AND POTATOES.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,294
>> WARRENING ‐‐ WARRENING ‐‐

48
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:21,782
THE SENTANTOR IS HERE!

49
00:03:21,782 --> 00:03:26,060
SHE'S GOT A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE!

50
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,654
IT'S ELIZABETH WARREN!

51
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:43,754
>> THANK YOU, BILLY.
THANK YOU, ANDERSON.

52
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:45,146
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

53
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:50,571
I HAD SOME APPLES SLICES
BACKSTAGE, AND THEY'RE HITTING
ME LIKE COCAINE!

54
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:56,214
Y'ALL KNOW, I AM NOT A LESBIAN,
BUT ALL THE INGREDIENTS ARE
THERE.

55
00:03:56,214 --> 00:03:57,747
LET'S RIDE.

56
00:03:57,747 --> 00:03:59,982
>> WHO WOULD LIKE TO ASK A
QUESTION?

57
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:03,399
>> SO, SENATOR, LET'S SAY YOU'VE
BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

58
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:06,662
>> YEAH. YEAH!
I-- UH-- I HAVE.

59
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:09,188
>> HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND IF
SOMEONE SAID TO YOU,

60
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:14,435
I'M
OLD‐FASHIONED AND MY FAITH
TEACHES ME THAT MARRIAGE IS
BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN?

61
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:18,108
>> LOOK, I'M GOING TO
ASSUME IT'S A GUY ASKING.

62
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:23,382
>> OOH, SNAP!
THE LIBRARY IS OPEN, AND MISS THING
IS ABOUT TO GET READ!

63
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,839
>> I WOULD SAY,

64
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:32,254
SIR, TELL ME
YOUR BUS STOP, BECAUSE I WANT TO
KNOW WHERE YOU GET OFF.

65
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:34,500
WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE?

66
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,703
IF SOMEONE DOESN'T WANT TO
SERVE GAY PEOPLE AT THEIR SMALL BUSINESS

67
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:40,751
I BET THAT'S NOT THE
ONLY THING THAT'S SMALL.

68
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:47,600
AND WHEN PEOPLE SAY, GAY AND
TRANS PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE
INCLUDED IN CIVIL RIGHTS
ACT PROTECTIONS...

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,463
WELL, I WISH THEIR PARENTS HAD
USED PROTECTION.

70
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,426
>> YES! YES!
WORK IT OUT, WORK IT OUT!

71
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:08,922
AND NOW FROM THE HOUSE OF URBAN DELICIOUSNESS

72
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:12,321
IT'S JULIAN CASTRO.

73
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:30,648
>> SO HAPPY TO BE HERE, AND
LOOK, I EVEN GOT A PARTICIPATION
RIBBON.

74
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:33,028
NOW, COME ON.
CUT TO THE CHASE.

75
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:36,883
WHEN DO THE "QUEER EYES" GUYS
COME OUT?
I WANT TO GO ROCK CLIMBING WITH
KARAMO.

76
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:39,323
>> THIS ISN'T "QUEER EYE"
SENATOR.

77
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:43,041
>> ACTUALLY IT'S SECRETARY.
>> I WOULDN'T TELL PEOPLE THAT.

78
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,113
>> OKAY, NEXT QUESTION.

79
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:49,886
>> MY QUESTION IS, IF ELECTED
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO BRING QUEER
VOICES INTO YOUR CABINET?

80
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:53,126
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, GRACIAS.

81
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:58,106
AS A DEMOCRAT, I WANT TO
APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING
GAY...

82
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:03,349
BUT I PROMISE TO DO BETTER
IN THE FUTURE.

83
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:08,415
HOWEVER, I AM LATINO, WHICH WE
CAN ALL AGREE IS SOMETHING.

84
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:11,880
LOOK, I'M YOUNG.
I'M DIVERSE.

85
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,248
I'M LATINOBAMA.

86
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,965
LET'S GET THE HASHTAG GOING ‐‐
#LATINOBAMA. PLEASE.

87
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:19,307
>> ALRIGHT. ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D
LIKE TO SAY?

88
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:23,238
>> YOU KNOW THERE WAS ONCE
ANOTHER MAN WHO LEFT HIS MARK ON
THIS NATION'S HISTORY,

89
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:25,611
BUT HE
NEVER BECAME PRESIDENT.

90
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,223
>> HOW DOES--
>> REALLY?

91
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:31,708
>> I WAS GONNA SAY AL GORE!
I WAS GONNA SAY AL GORE!

92
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,034
COME ON!

93
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:35,261
>> THANK YOU, SECRETARY CASTRO.

94
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,836
>> SO REMEMBER TO VOTE FOR ME FOR
VICE PRESIDENT ‐‐

95
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:40,169
PRESIDENT! DAMMIT!

96
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,034
>> YES, YES, YES!

97
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:47,684
AND NOW THE DELAWARE DADDY

WHO'S ONLY VICE IS THE CHOO CHOO
TRAIN!

99
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:57,131
IT'S VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN,
Y'ALL!

100
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,771
>> HI, ANDERSON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

101
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,941
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

102
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:15,640
>> TOO CLOSE, MR. VICE
PRESIDENT.
TOO CLOSE.

103
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,316
HOW ARE YOU TONIGHT?
>> UM, I'M GLAD WE'RE DOING THIS.

104
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:22,885
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN
AMERICA ARE NOT HOMOPHOBIC.

105
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:25,309
THEY'RE JUST SCARED OF GAY
PEOPLE.

106
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:27,892
>> THAT'S WHAT HOMOPHOBIC MEANS,
JOE.

107
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:32,066
>> LOOK, YOU KNOW ME.
I WENT TO BAT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY

108
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:34,228
AND I BELIEVE WE'RE ALL EQUAL.

109
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:38,869
WHETHER YOU'RE GAY,
LESBY, TRANSGENITAL, OR QUEEF.

110
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:41,452
YOU'RE OKAY WITH JOE.

111
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:45,804
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A SECOND
TO RESET AND GO TO AN AUDIENCE
QUESTION.

112
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:48,206
>> HI, MR. VICE PRESIDENT.

113
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,923
>> OH, LOOK AT YOU.

114
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:56,068
IF I TOLD YOU, YOU HAD A
BEAUTIFUL BODY, WOULD YOU HOLD
IT AGAINST ME?

115
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:59,635
>> SURE.
MR. VICE PRESIDENT ‐‐

116
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:03,545
‐‐ HOW CAN YOU DEFEND YOUR
PAST SUPPORT OF DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL?

117
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:05,800
I'M GLAD YOU HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION

118
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,153
AND LET ME ANSWER BY
TELLING YOU A FALSE MEMORY.

119
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:14,606
NOW, THE YEAR WAS 19 ‐‐

120
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:23,584
26, AND I WAS IN DOWNTOWN DOVER
WITH MY FATHER,

121
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:26,254
AND WE SEE TWO
WELL DRESSED MEN ‐‐

122
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:29,094
VERY WELL DRESSED MEN.

123
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:32,638
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY WELL
DRESSED?
RIGHT?

124
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,424
ANYWAY ‐‐

125
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:39,554
WHO'S NERVOUS ABOUT THIS STORY?
SHOW OF HANDS.

126
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:42,901
>> WE'RE ALL NERVOUS, JOE.
>> THEN I'LL KEEP GOING.

127
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:46,457
AND THESE MEN TURNED THE CORNER
AND KISS.

128
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:51,067
AND I TURNED TO MY DADDY AND
I SAY, "WHAT THE HUH?"

129
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:54,724
AND HE SAID, "BABY, THEY WERE
BORN THIS WAY."

130
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:57,872
AND THAT WAS DELAWARE 19
CLICKITY CLACK.

131
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:00,252
>> OKAY JOE...
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

132
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:04,963
>> AND THANK YOU FOR
EVERYONE THAT PLAYED TONIGHT
BUT WE ALL KNOW I'M YOUR GUY.

133
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:10,963
SO IN CLOSING, EVER BEEN KISSED
BY A VP BEFORE?

134
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:17,147
>> YOU JUST HELPED ME WIN A BET, JOE.
YOU JUST HELPED ME WIN A BET.

135
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:19,839
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.
>> YEAH, AND ‐‐

136
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,841
>> All: LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT"!

137
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:04,300
MUSICAL GUEST, CAMILA CABELLO,

138
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:09,154
AND YOUR HOST, DAVID HARBOUR.

139
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,735
>> Announcer: LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN ‐‐
DAVID HARBOUR.

140
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,604

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
VERY MUCH.

142
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:38,793
I'M DAVID HARBOUR.

143
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:44,115
NOW, I PLAY CHIEF HOPPER ON
THE SHOW "STRANGER THINGS".

144
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:51,616
MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS,
BUT I ACTUALLY PUT ON 20 POUNDS
FOR THAT ROLE.

145
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:55,328
NOBODY ASKED ME TO DO THAT, BUT
I DID THAT.

146
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:59,140
IT'S A GREAT SHOW.
I GET TO ACT WITH A BUNCH OF AMAZING KIDS

147
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,100
WHO ARE ALL GOING

UPDATE" WITH COLIN JOST AND
MICHAEL CHE.

00:31:29,128 --> 00:31:31,487
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

I'M MICHAEL CHE.

458
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:39,615
ACCORDING TO A FOX NEWS POLL 51%
OF AMERICANS SUPPORT IMPEACHING
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

459
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:43,780
AND YOU KNOW IT'S BAD CAUSE FOX NEWS
BARELY TALKED ABOUT THEIR OWN
POLL.

460
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:49,350
I SAW THE POLL ALL OVER MSNBC
WHEN I FLIPPED OVER TO FOX NEWS THEY
WERE DECORATING CAKES.

461
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,532
MEANWHILE, CNN I SAW THIS
HEADLINE.

462
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:58,102
TRUMP LOSES FIVE COURT CASES IN ONE DAY
AS HE DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM GIULIANI

463
00:31:58,102 --> 00:31:59,395
AND I COULDN'T READ
ANYMORE.

464
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:04,521
IT'S NEVER GOOD WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH
BAD NEWS CNN HAS TO SWITCH TO A
SMALLER FONT TO FIT IT ALL.

465
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:08,885
AND IT'S DEFINITELY ABOUT TO GET
WORSE FOR TRUMP BECAUSE OF
THESE TWO SHREKS.

466
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:14,634
TWO SOVIET-BORN ASSOCIATES
OF RUDY GIULIANI
IGOR FRUMAN AND LEV PARNAS

467
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:18,158
WHO WERE SOMEHOW NOT KILLED BY
JOHN WICK ‐‐

468
00:32:19,476 --> 00:32:23,314
WERE ARRESTED IN DULLES AIRPORT
IN WASHINGTON

469
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:26,669
FOR ALLEGEDLY
FUNNELING RUSSIAN MONEY TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

470
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:29,368
WHICH AS YOU
MIGHT HAVE GUESSED IS VERY
ILLEGAL.

471
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:32,715
AND BEFORE TRUMP SAYS,
"I DON'T EVEN KNOW THESE GUYS,

472
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:35,762
HERE'S A QUICK SLIDE SHOW
I PUT TOGETHER.

473
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:48,390
>> GOD, THEY PHOTOGRAPH WELL.

474
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,133
GIULIANI'S TWO ASSOCIATES ARE
ALSO SUCCESSFUL
ENTREPRENEURS.

475
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:58,625
IGOR, THE HANDSOME ONE, OWNS A
CLUB IN UKRAINE THAT'S CALLED MAFIA RAVE,

476
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:01,803
WHICH I THINK COUNTS
AS A FULL CONFESSION.

477
00:33:01,803 --> 00:33:06,157
AND THEN LEV, THE SHY ONE,
OWNS A SECURITY BUSINESS CALLED,

478
00:33:06,157 --> 00:33:09,109
I SWEAR TO YOU,
FRAUD GUARANTEE.

479
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:14,473
AND SO MY GUARANTEE IS THAT
TRUMP IS ABOUT TO LOSE
COURT CASE NUMBER SIX.

480
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:20,297
>> FIRST OF ALL, BRAVO TO THE
CASTING AGENCY THAT FOUND THESE
TWO THUMB-BREAKERS.

481
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:23,726
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY USE
VODKA AS COLOGNE.

482
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:27,694
THESE GUYS HAVE DEFINITELY WORN
TRACK SUITS TO THEIR DAUGHTER'S
WEDDING.

483
00:33:27,694 --> 00:33:32,834
I KNOW THESE ARE EASY JOKES BUT I'M
JUST SURPRISED THESE GUYS WERE HELPING THE PRESIDENT

484
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:38,403
AND NOT, I
DON'T KNOW, HELPING
GEORGE COSTANZA GET THAT FROGGER
MACHINE ACROSS THE STREET.

485
00:33:38,403 --> 00:33:42,787
>> AND HOW IS DONALD TRUMP
HANDLING IMPEACHMENT?

486
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,426
WELL, I WOULD SAY NOT GREAT

487
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:47,928
BASED ON WHAT HE DID AT HIS
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT RALLY ON
THURSDAY.

488
00:33:47,928 --> 00:33:50,380
THIS IS AN ACTUAL HEADLINE ABOUT
THE RALLY.

489
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:55,884
TRUMP APPEARS TO DO BIZARRE
IMPRESSION OF FBI AGENTS HAVING
SEX."

490
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:58,854
AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, THAT'S GOT
TO BE AN EXAGGERATION.
RIGHT?"

491
00:33:58,854 --> 00:34:00,341
THEN I SAW THE CLIP.

492
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:04,120
>> I LOVE YOU, PETER.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, LISA.

493
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,781
LISA, I ‐‐ LISA, LISA,

494
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:10,180
OH, GOD. I LOVE YOU, LISA.

495
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,298
>> FIRST OF ALL, HE'S KILLING.

496
00:34:15,298 --> 00:34:18,428
LIKE, THE AUDIENCE LOVES IT.
I'M ACTUALLY JEALOUS.

497
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:23,526
THAT RALLY WAS LIKE "SHOWTIME AT
THE APOLLO" EXCEPT, YOU KNOW,
OPPOSITE.

498
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:31,719
ALSO, THE CROWD IS LAUGHING
ALONG WITH THIS BIT LIKE THEY HAVE
ANY IDEA WHO THESE FBI AGENTS ARE.

499
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:37,628
I BET TRUMP'S IMPRESSION OF
THOSE TWO AGENTS IS ABOUT AS
ACCURATE AS MY IMPRESSION OF
PETE BUTTIGIEG.

500
00:34:40,816 --> 00:34:46,401
>> DEMOCRATS ARE CALLING
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR UNCONSTITUTIONAL

501
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:50,676
TO WHICH TRUMP
RESPONDED, "YOU'RE RIGHT.
I HAD NO IDEA.
AND I'M SORRY."

502
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:52,612
I'M JUST KIDDING.
YOU KNOW THAT BOY AIN'T RIGHT.

503
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:58,825
DO YOU THINK AFTER THIS WHOLE
IMPEACHMENT THING IS OVER WE CAN
JUST TAKE A YEAR OFF
FROM PRESIDENTS?

504
00:34:58,825 --> 00:35:03,600
JUST TO CLEAR OUR HEADS A LITTLE.
YOU KNOW, NOT RUSH INTO SOMEONE
ELSE HORRIBLE?

505
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,027
RIGHT NOW MY STANDARDS ARE SO
LOW, I SAW BERNIE SANDERS HAVE A
HEART ATTACK

506
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:11,052
AND I WAS LIKE,
MAYBE HIM!
HE SEEMS TOUGH.

507
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:13,972
I MEAN WE CAN AFFORD A BREAK.
RIGHT?
AS A COUNTRY.

508
00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:19,865
WHY DON'T JUST TAKE SOME OF THAT
OLD FREE COTTON MONEY AND COAST
FOR AWHILE UNTIL WE GET OUR
GROOVE BACK?

509
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,581
CAN'T SAY COTTON MONEY ON NBC?

510
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:32,574
>>> TRUMP THEN EXPLAINED
WITHDRAWING TROOPS FROM NORTHERN SYRIA SAYING

511
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:35,702
THAT WE DIDN'T NEED
TO DEFEND OUR KURDISH ALLIES
BECAUSE QUOTE,

512
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:37,715
"THEY DIDN'T HELP US IN
WORLD WAR II."

513
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:42,517
BUT WITH WORLD WAR II, IT'S KIND OF
HARD TO KNOW WHO TRUMP MEANS BY
US.

514
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:49,260
>>> IN OTHER FOREIGN NEWS,
AFTER BEING ASKED ABOUT THE
WIFE OF A U.S. DIPLOMAT IN BRITAIN

515
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,603
STRIKING AND KILLING A TEENAGER WHILE
DRIVING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD,

516
00:35:52,603 --> 00:35:54,366
PRESIDENT TRUMP
SAID THIS.

517
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:57,325
>> AND THE WOMAN WAS DRIVING ON
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD

518
00:35:57,325 --> 00:36:01,247
AND THAT CAN HAPPEN.
YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE
THE OPPOSITE ROADS.
THAT HAPPENS.

519
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:04,673
I WON'T SAY IT EVER HAPPENED TO
ME, BUT IT DID.

520
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,981
>> I'M SORRY
IT DID HAPPEN TO YOU?

521
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:15,880
I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S CRAZIER, THAT THE
PRESIDENT STRAIGHT UP ADMITTED TO
VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER ON LIVE TV

522
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,528
OR THAT HE'S PRETENDING HE EVER
DROVE A CAR?

523
00:36:19,528 --> 00:36:25,121
>> CNN HELD AN EQUALITY TOWN
HALL WITH NINE OF THE DEMOCRATIC
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

524
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:29,209
ANSWERING QUESTIONS
ABOUT THEIR VIEWS ON LGBTQ
ISSUES.

525
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:32,474
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.
MAYOR PETE DID ESPECIALLY
WELL.

526
00:36:32,474 --> 00:36:36,775
I'VE HEARD PEOPLE ASK IF
AMERICA'S READY TO HAVE IT'S
FIRST GAY PRESIDENT?"

527
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:41,205
BUT THERE'S NO WAY WE
HAVEN'T ALREADY HAD OUR FIRST GAY
PRESIDENT.

528
00:36:41,205 --> 00:36:43,911
WE'VE PICKED 45 GUYS IN A ROW.

529
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:47,252
THE BETTER QUESTION IS, WHICH
ONE?

530
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:50,232
MY GUESS IS ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

531
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:54,449
WELL HE GOT SHOT AT THE
THEATER.
THAT'S A PRETTY GAY WAY TO GO.

532
00:36:57,001 --> 00:37:01,240
I BET JOHN WILKES BOOTH WAS
LIKE, "I KNOW WHERE THAT BITCH IS.

533
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,557
HE'S WATCHING "KINKY BOOTS"
AGAIN.

534
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:11,527
>> JOE BIDEN ‐‐ JOE BIDEN FOR
THE FIRST TIME CALLED FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BE IMPEACHED AND REMOVED FROM OFFICE

535
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:16,723
AFTER HE
FINALLY REALIZED THAT THE
JOE BIDEN TRUMP KEEPS ATTACKING
WAS HIM.

536
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:21,814

I'M LIKE, LIGHT?

MOVIES HAVE YOU SEEN RECENTLY?

548
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:08,700
>> OKAY. UM, WELL
SO I SAW "IT CHAPTER TWO."

549
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,983
AND I DON'T KNOW, IT WAS LIKE,
AWKWARD!

550
00:38:11,983 --> 00:38:17,753
OH MY GOD, LIKE ‐‐ PENNYWISE YOU

>> I GET THAT. WELL...
HAVE YOU SEE ANYTHING ELSE?

553

>> OH YEAH, SO UM ‐‐
SO I SAW "JUDY."

554
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:30,679
IT'S LIKE AWKWARD.
THE SINGING WAS THIRSTY.

555
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:33,789
IT'S LIKE ‐‐ I'M IN JAZZ CHOIR TOO.

556
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:38,262
BUT I DIDN'T MAKE A WHOLE JAZZ
CHOIR MOVIE ABOUT IT.

557
00:38:38,262 --> 00:38:42,325
>> ALL RIGHT.
DID YOU SEE THE "JOKER"?
LOTS OF PEOPLE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
JOKER.

558
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:46,734

SO, I GUESS I SAW IT

559
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:52,183
AND, YEAH,
IT WAS LIKE "PSYCHO" BUT LIKE, IT'S
NOTHING I CAN'T HANDLE.

>> WHAT?
BAILEY?
DO YOU LIKE THE JOKER?

LIKE HIM.
I JUST LIKE THINK I COULD HELP
HIM.

563
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,518
AND, LIKE, YEAH, ARTHUR AND I HAVE A
LOT IN COMMON.

LIKE, WE'RE SILLY.
WE'RE FIT.
WE HAVE GOOD LOOKS.

565
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:13,755

CROCODILE COSBY.

YEAH, AND I MIGHT HAVE CREATED MY OWN,

626

BUT EVERY SINGLE TIME I JUST
PRAY I ONLY GET THE ONES YOU JUST MENTIONED

627
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:39,359
BECAUSE YOU CAN
JUST TAKE A PILL AND KEEP
ROLLING THE DICE.
YOU KNOW?

628
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,321
YEAH, THE FLU CAN LAST LIKE A MONTH.

629

BUT SYPHILIS IS LIKE, FOUR DAYS.
BRING IT ON.

630

THE FLU IS LIKE FOUR SYPHILISES.

>> I GUESS THAT'S LIKE A REALLY OPTIMISTIC
WAY OF LOOKING AT IT.
>> THE ONLY WAY, COLIN.

632

IT'S LIKE HELPING. YOU KNOW?

637
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:17,696
WAY MORE PEOPLE ARE DATING, LIKE,
OUTSIDE THEIR RACE AND THEIR
SOCIAL CLASS AND RELIGION.

638
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:21,852
YOU'RE GOING TO RISK ALL THAT
ETHNIC HARMONY JUST TO STOP A FEW
BUSTED PIPES FROM DRIPPING?

639
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:23,276
I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR.

640
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:28,133
>> WHAT?
>> FINE.
PENIS.
YOU CHILD.

641

THEY DON'T LET US SAY ANY OF THE
FUN WORDS.

642
00:44:30,676 --> 00:44:34,200
YOU THINK, "BUSTED PIPES DRIPPING"
WAS MY FIRST CHOICE?

643
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,984
>> I'M WORRIED YOU MAY BE GIVING
PEOPLE BAD ADVICE.
>> YEAH DEFINITELY

644
00:44:38,984 --> 00:44:42,794
BUT LISTEN. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A BAD THING

645
00:44:42,794 --> 00:44:46,470
THAT ALL OF THESE
DISEASES ARE BACK AFTER SO MANY YEARS.

646
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,958
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
GONORRHEA.

647
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:51,000
DOES EVERYTHING IN MY GENERATION,
HAVE TO BE A REBOOT?

648
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,874
LIKE THE CLAP AND RAMBO CAME
BACK IN THE SAME YEAR.

649
00:44:54,874 --> 00:44:58,981
AND NEITHER OF THEM WERE WANTED.

653
00:45:10,131 --> 00:45:15,420
SO, NO.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'M SAYING TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU,
YOU SHOULD WEAR YOU KNOW, WEAR A CONDOM,

654
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:21,654
BUT SINCE YOU WON'T, YOU
KNOW ‐‐
CALL YOUR DOCTOR AND GET
ANTIBIOTICS.
THAT'S ALL.

655
00:45:21,654 --> 00:45:24,885

>> YES.
THAT'S REALLY IT.

661
