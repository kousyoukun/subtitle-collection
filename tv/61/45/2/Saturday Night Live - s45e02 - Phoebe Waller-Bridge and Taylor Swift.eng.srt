1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
OFFICE

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,489
>>> RUDY, ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR,
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.

3
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:14,375
AS YOU KNOW, THIS IMPEACHMENT
FARCE IS GROWING WORSE BY THE
DAY.

4
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,055
AND NOW A SECOND WHISTLE‐BLOWER
IS COMING FORWARD.

5
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:22,030
>> AND IT'S ALL HAPPENING DURING
MY BUSY SEASON ‐‐ HALLOWEEN.

6
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:27,380
>> WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT, MIKE?
>> HE HAS MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
TO DEAL WITH.

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,702
HE'S MEETING WITH AN ALLIGATOR
BREEDER ABOUT FILLING A MOAT AT
THE BORDER.

8
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:37,505
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.
I KNOW A COUPLE OF GATORS FROM
WHEN I LIVED IN THE CENTRAL PARK
ZOO.

9
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:41,508
>> RUDY, WE NEED TO GET AHEAD OF
THIS STORY BEFORE IT SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL.

10
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,717
DID YOU SEE THE TEXT MESSAGES THEY UNCOVERED?

11
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:48,083
>> WHAT!
THEY TOTALLY EXONERATE US.

12
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,567
>> REALLY? WHAT DO THEY SAY?

13
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:54,829
>> THIS ONE SAYS, I THINK WE
SHOULD STOP TEXTING ABOUT THE
CRIMES

14
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,226
AND MAYBE TELL THE CRIMES OVER THE PHONE

15
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:02,466
SO THAT THE
CRIMES DON'T LEAVE LITTLE CRIME
FOOTPRINTS.

16
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:04,486
SEE, IT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

17
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:09,765
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE SEEING THE
NEW JUDY GARLAND MOVIE WITH
MOTHER.

18
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:15,082
>> YOU WORRY TOO MUCH, MIKE.
PRESIDENTS GET IMPEACHED EVERY
30 OR 40 YEARS.

19
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:18,807
NOW, COME ON, RELAX, HAVE
ANOTHER GLASS OF MILK.

20
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:21,915
>> WELL, IT'S 5:00 SOMEWHERE.

21
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:28,336
>> MR. VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARY
MIKE POMPEO HAS RETURNED FROM
GREECE AND IS HERE TO SEE YOU.

22
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:33,428
>> THANKS.
GOOD TO BE BACK.

23
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:40,431
>> MIKE, WEREN'T YOU SUBPOENAED
BY CONGRESS?

24
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:43,643
>> I WAS, BUT I THINK I BOUGHT
MYSELF A LITTLE TIME.

25
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:48,350
>> THIS MEETING OF THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WILL NOW
COME TO ORDER.

26
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:56,795
POMPEO.
POMPEO.
POMPEO.

27
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:04,969
>> LISTEN, I'VE BEEN ASKING
AROUND AND I THINK THAT THIS
WHOLE IMPEACHMENT THING COULD BE
REALLY BAD.

28
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:08,985
>> WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
>> LIKE, AMERICA.

29
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:12,519
>> NOT ACCORDING TO THIS
BREITBART OFFICE POLL

30
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:17,621
THAT SAYS 121% OF PEOPLE WANT BIDEN
IMPEACHED.

31
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:22,376
>> MAYBE WE SHOULD LISTEN TO
MIKE.
AFTER ALL, HE IS SECRETARY OF ‐‐

32
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,028
>> STATE, I THINK?
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

33
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:28,413
MY I. D. JUST SAYS BIG MIKE.

34
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:33,592
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THE ONLY ORIGINAL CABINET MEMBER
LEFT IS BEN CARSON.

35
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:36,466
>> DID SOMEBODY SAY MY NAME?

36
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:41,189
>> THAT'S OKAY, BEN.
THIS ISN'T YOUR JOB.

37
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:45,261
>> OKAY.
BUT I'VE BEEN SITTING IN MY
EMPTY OFFICE FOR LIKE THREE
YEARS.

38
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:48,314
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT MY JOB IS
SUPPOSED TO BE?

39
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:50,212
>> NO IDEA.
ANYONE?
>> I DON'T KNOW.

40
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,408
NO

41
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:56,646
>> EVEN IF SOMEBODY COULD GIVE
ME MY PASSWORD TO MY COMPUTER,
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT HELP.

42
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:59,232
>> I BETTER SHOW MR. CARSON OUT.

43
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:02,429
>> BUT YOU'LL BE BACK, RIGHT?
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS
HERE.

44
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:06,526
>> OH, FOR SURE, 100%.
SEE YOU SOON.

45
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:12,317
>> LISTEN, GUYS, WE'RE GOING TO
JUST FINE.
WE NEED TO CLOSE RANKS, YOU KNOW?

46
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,883
LIKE THE MAFIA.

47
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:18,577
>> UH, YEAH, EXCEPT THE MAFIA
WAS LIKE, SMART.

48
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:23,240
THEY DIDN'T GO ON FOX NEWS AND
TELL PEOPLE THE CRIMES BEFORE THEY DID THEM.

49
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,791
>> OH, THAT REMINDS ME, I
PROMISED HANNITY I WOULD GO ON
HIS SHOW TONIGHT.

50
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:30,245
makeup

51
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:34,550
WHILE I'M GOING, YOU GUYS SHOULD
GET YOUR STORIES STRAIGHT,

52
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,209
HOW HUNTER BIDEN STARTED PIZZA GATE

53
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,645
OR HOW THIS CAN ALL BE TRACED BACK TO ‐‐

54
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:45,290
TEXT IT TO ME SO THE
FEDS HAVE A RECORD.

55
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,281
I'LL BE BACK.

56
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:52,705
>> HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT ABOUT
GETTING OUR STORIES STRAIGHT.

57
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:59,076
>> YES, BECAUSE EVEN IF THEY'RE
NOT STRAIGHT NOW, THEY COULD
STILL BE CONVERTED TO STRAIGHT,
RIGHT?

58
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:08,353
>> YOU KNOW, THOUGH, THE OTHER
THING WE COULD DO IS JUST FLEE THE COUNTRY.

59
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:11,595
THERE'S WHOLE LIST OF COUNTRIES
THAT WOULD LOVE TO HAVE US.

60
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:16,097
NORTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA.
END OF LIST.

61
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:21,018
>> I'M SORRY, WHO IS THIS GUY?
>> I'M THE PRESIDENT OF FINLAND.

62
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:25,312
>> OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE STILL HERE?
FROM THE PRESS CONFERENCE?

63
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:29,423
>> YES.
MR. TRUMP KEPT SCREAMING AND THEN HE JUST WALKED OFF

64
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:32,375
AND I
DID NOT KNOW IF IT WAS OVER OR WHAT.

65
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,193
>> YOU CAN GO.
YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

66
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:40,391
>> WELL, I JUST WANT TO SAY THE
CONCEPT OF DIPLOMACY IS VERY
IMPORTANT.

67
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,441
>> OH, THAT'S CUTE.

68
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:45,378
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO WALK THIS GUY OUT.

69
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:50,022
SO WHAT'S FINLAND LIKE? I MEAN TO LIVE IN.
>> IT'S NICE.

70
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:52,308
>> WAIT.
YOU'RE COMING BACK, RIGHT, MIKE?

71
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:55,946
BECAUSE IF THINGS GO BAD FOR
TRUMP, THEN I'M PRESIDENT.

72
00:04:55,946 --> 00:04:58,976
>> OH, YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S GREAT,
THAT'S GOING TO WORK OUT JUST GREAT.

73
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:01,436
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

74
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:05,197
AND HEY, IMPEACHMENT MOVES
PRETTY FAST.

75
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:08,512
IF YOU DON'T STOP AND LOOK
AROUND, MIGHT MISS IT.

76
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:16,520
>> WOW, IT LOOKS LIKE I'M HERE ALL ALONE.

77
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:21,326
>> ACTUALLY, SIR, STEPHEN MILLER
WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

78
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:24,742
FANTASTIC.
>> HERE HE IS.

79
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,566
>> OH, THANKS FOR COMING BY,
STEPHEN.

80
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:30,694
DO YOU HAVE ANY WAY OUT OF THIS
IMPEACHMENT?

81
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,488
OH, REALLY?

82
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:37,248
BIDEN, CORRUPTION?

83
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:42,157
GET NICOLAS CAGE TO STEAL THE
CONSTITUTION AND BLAME IT ON
IMMIGRANTS?

84
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:44,884
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT WILL
WORK?

85
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:49,800
GOD, HE'S GOOD.
HE'S GOOD.

86
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,100
>> AND SPEAKING OF GOOD, RUDY
GIULIANI IS BACK FROM HIS
APPEARANCE ON FOX NEWS.

87
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,744
HE'S STILL IN STAGE MAKEUP.

88
00:05:58,252 --> 00:06:00,995
>> I KILLED ON HANNITY.

89
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:05,727
>> DID YOU SAY KILLED?
>> THAT'S RIGHT, AND I'LL KILL
AGAIN.

90
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:10,280
>> LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

91
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:50,499
MUSICAL GUEST, TAYLOR SWIFT.

92
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:56,038
AND YOUR HOST,
PHOEBE WALLER‐BRIDGE.

93
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:04,144
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PHOEBE WALLER‐BRIDGE.

94
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:28,489
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
HELLO, EVERYONE.

95
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:31,422
MY NAME IS PHOEBE WALLER‐BRIDGE.

96
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:35,756
I'M HONORED TO BE HERE HOSTING
SNL.

97
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:43,105
I'M FROM THE U. K., WHICH MEANS I
FIND EVERYTHING
EMBARRASSING.

98
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:47,315
AND THIS MONOLOGUE IS PROBABLY
THE MOST EMBARRASSING THING I'VE EVER DONE.

99
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:51,320
AND STANDING IN FRONT OF A JAZZ
BAND IN HIGH HEELS, LIVE
TELEVISION,

100
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,485
JOKING ABOUT MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS ‐‐

101
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:55,749
ACTUALLY THAT
SOUNDS PRETTY FUN.

102
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:58,600
ANYWAY, WHEN I ASKED, DO WE HAVE
TO DO THIS BIT?

103
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,943
THEY SAID, YES, IT'S PART OF
YOUR VISA.

104
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,596
I WROTE AND ACTED IN A TV SHOW
CALLED "FLEABAG."

105
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:14,983
IT'S ABOUT A WOMAN WHO IS TRYING
TO NAVIGATE HER LIFE IN LONDON.

106
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:18,121
PEOPLE OFTEN ASSUME THAT I'M
LIKE THE CHARACTER, FLEABAG.

107
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,496
SIMPLY BECAUSE I WROTE IT.

108
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:22,842
SEXUALLY DEPRAVED, FOUL MOUTHED,
AND DANGEROUS.

109
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:26,428
AND I ALWAYS HAVE TO SAY, YES,

110
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:28,036
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

111
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:32,990
IN FACT, EVERYTHING I WRITE HAS
A KEG OF TRUTH.
AND EVERY PROJECT IS DIFFERENT.

112
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,446
I'M NOT A SEX ADDICT BECAUSE I WROTE "FLEABAG"

113
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:38,765
BUT I DID WRITE
KILLING EVE BECAUSE I'M A PSYCHOPATH.

114
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:44,203
MY MOST EXCITING EX‐BOYFRIEND
WROTE NOTHING BUT WAS BOTH.

115
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:54,754
IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE A
PSYCHOPATH RIGHT NOW.

116
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:57,944
THEY'RE REALLY HAVING A MOMENT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

117
00:09:57,944 --> 00:10:02,205
WHEN I WAS WRITING "KILLING
EVE," I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH ON
PSYCHOPATHS.

118
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:06,988
SO MUCH SO THAT I DID ACTUALLY
START TO BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE
IN MY LIFE WAS ONE.

119
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,946
I TOLD MY HOUSEMATE, I THINK YOU
MIGHT BE A PSYCHOPATH

120
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:14,231
AND HE RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY WITH, I
HAVE EMPATHY.

121
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:19,022
WHICH I FOUND A LITTLE
UNNERVING.

122
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:21,905
SO, YOU KNOW, SEXY.

123
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:25,299
FLEABAG CAME FROM A VERY
PERSONAL PLACE FOR ME.

124
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:29,982
IT BEGAN AS A WAY TO GET
ANDREW SCOTT TO DRESS UP AS A
PRIEST AND TELL ME THAT HE LOVES ME.

125
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:35,268
IT TOOK ME SIX YEARS.
AND TWO
SEASONS TO ACHIEVE IT BUT I DID IT.

126
00:10:38,724 --> 00:10:43,027
I DON'T CARE ABOUT AWARDS, I
JUST
WANT GAY MEN TO LOVE ME.

127
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:48,224
I CALLED THE CHARACTER "PRIEST"
IN THE SCRIPT BUT EVERYONE
STARTED CALLING HIM "HOT
PRIEST."

128
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:53,930
OBVIOUSLY, ANDREW IS HOT.
BUT THIS PRIEST CHARACTER CAUSED
SUCH A HORN STORM.

129
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,417
ANDREW AND I WERE TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS ABOUT HIM
THAT WAS DRIVING WOMEN SO MENTAL.

130
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:02,042
AND WE BOILED IT DOWN AND REALIZED,

131
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:05,954
IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS
DOING THIS ONE THING ‐‐

132
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,207
LISTENING.

133
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,821
JUST REALLY, REALLY LISTENING.

134
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:19,374
TRY IT, GUYS.

135
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:21,989
BUT
WE ALL FIND WEIRD THINGS SEXY.

136
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:25,325
AND WOMEN CAN NOW SPEAK MUCH
MORE OPENLY ABOUT THEIR DESIRES,

137
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:28,785
ABOUT BEING BURNED AT THE STAKE,
WHICH IS NICE.
I LOVE THAT.

138
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:34,216
BACK IN THE DAY, HORNY WOMEN
WERE TO BE FEARED AND NOW
THEY'RE GIVEN EMMYS.

139
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:43,574
SEXUAL CONVERSATION FOR WOMEN
IS EXPANDING.

140
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:47,880
THE WEIRDER YOUR FANTASY, THE
MORE OPEN YOU ARE ABOUT IT, THE
COOLER YOU ARE.

141
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,189
OH,
YOU LOCKED YOUR HUSBAND IN THE
ATTIC?
ROCK ON, SISTER.

IT'S KIND OF INCREDIBLE HOW
LITTLE ATTENTION WE ACTUALLY PAY
OUR GENITALS.

148
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:22,637
WHEN WE FOCUS ON THEM OR IF THEY
GET SICK OR SOMETHING, THEN IT'S ALL ABOUT THEM.

149
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:26,564
THE REST OF THE TIME, THEY'RE JUST SITTING THERE.

HE MAY STOP REFERRING TO THE MEDIA AS "FAKE
NEWS" AND START CALLING THEM CORRUPT NEWS.

CALLING HIM

USED TO IT.
IT'S LIKE PUTTING ON A SUIT."

FEEL LIKE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE BUSIER THAN CHRISSY TEIGEN.

516
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:15,884
BUT IF THE PRESIDENT IS AS STRONG AS I THINK HE IS,

YOU HAD SAID IT AT ANY OTHER
TIME IN HISTORY,

WOULD HAVE
MEANT THAT YOU WERE IN THE
MIDDLE OF A STROKE.

522

I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT
NICKELBACK IS CANADIAN.

523
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:45,584

SO YOU RAISED ALL OF THIS MONEY WITHOUT ANY CORPORATE DONATIONS,
IS THAT RIGHT?

533
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:31,979
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S GREAT ROOTS.

OH, DO YOU MIND IF I DO A
THOUSAND MORE?

548
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,012
>> NO, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR A
THOUSAND, I'M SORRY.

549
00:41:26,012 --> 00:41:29,865
THERE'S BEEN SOME BIG MONEY

OH, NO!

553
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:46,521
LOOK, I'M GOING TO TELL THEM THE
SAME THING MY GRANDSON TOLD ME

554

WHEN HE TOOK ME TO "AVENGERS

THIS AIN'T FOR YOU.

556
00:41:52,538 --> 00:41:56,726
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

557
00:41:56,726 --> 00:42:04,314
BUT THEN AGAIN, TAKING BIG
CHECKS FROM WALL STREET WORKED
GREAT FOR THE LAST LADY RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT.

558
00:42:06,606 --> 00:42:12,941
LET ME JUST SKIP WISCONSIN AND
CHANGE MY NAME TO EMAIL BENGHAZI WHILE I'M AT IT.

559
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,031
YOU'VE ALSO BEEN IN THE NEWS
BECAUSE A FRINGE CONSPIRACY THEORIST

560
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:27,447
ACCUSED OF YOU HAVING A
BDSM RELATIONSHIP WITH A
24‐YEAR‐OLD MARINE.

561
00:42:32,034 --> 00:42:36,385

00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:46,746
LOOK, RUMORS HAVE POWER WHEN THEY FEEL TRUE.

564
00:42:46,746 --> 00:42:51,900
WHAT HAS EVER FELT LESS TRUE
THAN ANY SINGLE PART OF THAT?

565
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,438
IF YOU THINK I'M IN A ROOM WITH
A VETERAN AND I DON'T
IMMEDIATELY THANK HIM FOR HIS SERVICE

566
00:42:56,438 --> 00:42:59,700

567
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:06,019
ALSO, 24?

DAY IS MY GRANDSON.

568
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:11,523

I AM INTO BDSM.

569

BANK‐DESTROYING, AND SAVING
MEDICARE.

BROUGHT THUNDER STICK OVER, I WAS A BIT SKEPTICAL,

721
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:48,890
MAINLY BECAUSE HE THREW A BAG OF COCAINE ON THE TABLE, AND SAID,

TAKE A LOOK AT
MY BIG BLACK ASS.

747
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,125
>> AND IN THE END WE DRIFTED
APART.

748
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:47,023
