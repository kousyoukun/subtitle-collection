00:00:00,513 --> 00:00:04,066
AL

2
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:08,097
>> HELLO EVERYONE.

3
00:00:08,097 --> 00:00:11,625
HELLO AND HELLO, NEW MEXICO.

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,759
BY FAR, MY FAVORITE MEXICO.

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,380
SO GREAT TO BE HERE IN THE GREAT
CITY OF ALBACORE.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,569
TUNA CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES.

7
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:25,837
I CAME BACK FOR A SURPRISE RALLY
BECAUSE I HEARD THEY'RE BUILDING
A WALL.

8
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:29,600
ON THE BORDER OF COLORADO.
TO KEEP THE NEW MEXICANS OUT.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,739
CAN WE BRING OUT THE MAP,
PLEASE?

10
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,903
AS YOU CAN SEE, MOST OF AMERICA
IS GOOD.

11
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:39,686
EXCEPT FOR THE PARTS THAT ARE
BAD OR LAKES.

12
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:43,253
I MEAN, WHAT IF WE HAD PUT
CALIFORNIA IN THE OCEAN?

13
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:47,643
THANK YOU, RAQUEL.
RAQUEL IS A FORMER MISS TEEN USA

14
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:51,130
AND OUR CURRENT SECRETARY OF
ENERGY.

15
00:00:52,447 --> 00:00:56,565
AS YOU KNOW, MY LYING
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY CONTINUES.

16
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:59,500
AND WHAT IS IT REALLY, FOLKS?
>> A WITCH HUNT!

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,701
>> AND THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO?
>> NO COLLUSION.

18
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:04,751
>> NO NO, THE NEW ONE.
THERE WAS NO ‐‐
>> QUID PRO QUO.

19
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:07,029
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

20
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:10,227
NO QUID BRO CODE.

21
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:14,300
THESE DEMOCRATS LED BY ADAM
SHIFTY‐SCHIFT,

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,315
HE'S A REAL
SCHIFF‐HEAD, IT'S A DEEP‐STATE
CONSPIRACY,

23
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:21,489
AND TONIGHT I'D
LIKE TO BRING UP SOME OF MY LOYAL FOLLOWERS

24
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:24,591
TO EXPLAIN
WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IN THIS
COUNTRY.

25
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:27,476
FIRST UP, WE HAVE CHRISTINE FROM
LAS CRUCES.

26
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:31,846
>> YES, I AM!
AND I AM PROUD THAT YOU
ASKED ME UP HERE!

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,405
>> UH, I THINK YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF
TYPOS ON THAT SHIRT.

28
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:40,322
>> NOPE, THIS WAS TAKEN VERBATIM
FROM ONE OF YOUR TWEETS,
THEREFORE IT'S CORRECT.

29
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:45,095
THE WORDS NEED TO CHANGE,
BECAUSE YOU SAID SO, SIR!

30
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:50,884
>> OKAY, WELL EXPLAIN TO EVERYONE
WHAT THE DEMS ARE DOING WITH
THIS IMPEACHMENT.

31
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:55,777
>> THIS MAN IS UNDER ATTACK!
IT'S DEEP STATE LIZARD
CONSPIRACY.

32
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:59,520
AND EVERYONE'S IN ON IT!
THE CIA, THE FBI!

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,598
THE M-I-C, THE K-E-Y,
AND THE M-O-U-S-E!

34
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:07,301
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.
>> NO, THANK YOU, SIR!

35
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:11,256
WHO'S NEXT?
WHO'S NEXT?

36
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,859
>> I AM, SIR.
I'M WITH BIKERS FOR TRUMP.

37
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:20,387
AND IF THEY TRY TO GET RID OF
YOU, THEN ALL OF US BIKERS, WE'RE
GOING TO RIDE.

38
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:22,960
>> WHAT IF THEY DON'T TRY TO GET
RID OF ME?

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,101
>> WE'RE GOING TO RIDE.
KIND OF THE ONLY THING WE DO.

40
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:30,200
>> RIGHT.
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY'RE
DOING THIS TO ME?

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,240
>> I DO, SIR, BECAUSE I WATCHED
IT IN A NEWS MACHINE.

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,644
ALL THIS MAN DID WAS SHAKE DOWN
A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO GET DIRT
ON HIS POLITICAL ENEMY.

43
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:41,753
I MEAN, IS THAT WRONG?
>> YES!

44
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:45,036
>> NO, NO, NO, THE ANSWER IS NO.
>> SORRY, NO!

45
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:47,722
>> I FORGIVE YOU.
I FORGIVE YOU.

46
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:50,940
HERE ARE SOME SNICKERS AND JUUL
PODS.

47
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:54,575
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

48
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:59,251
>> SIR, I LOVE YOU, AND I DON'T
CARE WHAT THEY SAY, I KNOW IT'S
BIG.

49
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:01,688
>> LET'S GIVE ANOTHER PERSON UP
HERE, PLEASE.

50
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:04,683
>> YES.
YES, HELLO.
I LOVE YOU.

51
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:08,321
AND I WORSHIP YOU AS THE ONE
TRUE WHITE LORD!

52
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:13,299
>> THANK YOU.
WHAT KIND OF REAL NEWS HAVE YOU
HEARD OUT THERE?

53
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:18,434
>> OH, YEAH, WELL, I HEARD THAT
IF YOU READ THE TITLE OF
MICHELLE OBAMA'S "BECOMING" BACKWARDS

54
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:20,354
IT SPELLS,
GNI MOC EB

55
00:03:20,354 --> 00:03:23,565
WHICH I LOOKED UP IN A
WITCH TH-- THESAURUS,

56
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:27,270
AND IT'S A
SYNONYM FOR ANOTHER WITCH WORD
SNART.

57
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,443
AND IF YOU SPELL SNART BACKWARDS
THAT SPELLS "TRANS"

58
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,523
SO YEAH,
THEY'RE COMING FOR US!

59
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:34,700
>> OKAY. OKAY, THAT'S
A VERY SMART POINT.

60
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,528
YOU SEE MY FOLLOWERS LOVE BOOKS.
EXCEPT THE NEW ONE ANONYMOUS BOOK
ABOUT ME CALLED, "A WARNING"

61
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:44,631
MY LAWYERS TOLD ME NOT TO SAY
THIS, BUT IF I FIND OUT WHO THE AUTHOR IS,

62
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:46,376
I'M GOING TO SHOOT THEM
IN THE FACE ON FIFTH AVENUE.

63
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,868
>> OH YEAH. AND I'D BE HONORED IF YOU
USED MY GUN.

64
00:03:48,868 --> 00:03:51,584
>> NO, NO, NO. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
JUST KEEP THAT GUN, OKAY?

65
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:53,035
OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

66
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:56,236
>> OKAY. WELL, THE EARTH IS FLAT AND
BEYONCE IS WHITE!

67
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:00,899
>> OKAY, WHO'S NEXT?
YOU, SIR, PLEASE.

68
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:04,622
>> SO GREAT TO SEE A YOUNG TRUMP
SUPPORTER.
>> OH, THANK YOU.

69
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:06,998
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
THANK YOU.

70
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:10,903
>> AND WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
NEW MEXICO?
>> ISIS!

71
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:14,508
YEAH, I WAS A PRISONER IN SYRIA
UNTIL LAST WEEK WHEN YOU FREED ME,

72
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:18,721
SO, I JUST WANTED TO SAY,
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING JOBS
BACK.

73
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:20,429
TO ISIS.

74
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:24,411
AND I PROMISE THAT I WILL MAKE
ISIS GREAT AGAIN!

75
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,657
>> TERRIFIC.
WHAT A GREAT GUY.

76
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:30,094
ISIS IS BACK IN A BIG, BIG WAY,
FOLKS.

77
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:32,580
AND WE LOVE THAT, DON'T WE?
OKAY.

78
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,877
BUT, WAIT, WHO'S COMING UP NOW?
DID SECURITY VET THIS GUY?

79
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:38,800
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW ME.
I'M LINDSEY GRAHAM.

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,981
>> LINDSEY, I'M SO SORRY,

81
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,387
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A SCOOP OF ICE
CREAM MELTING INTO A SUIT.

82
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:49,253
>> THAT'S CAUSE I'M SWEATING PROFUSELY
ALL THE TIME.

83
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:53,699
EVEN MY BODILY FLUIDS ARE TRYING
TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM ME.

84
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,817
>> I HAVE TO THANK YOU AND THE
REPUBLICANS FOR ALWAYS DEFENDING
ME.

85
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:03,310
>> WELL, I AM A TRUE SOUTHERNER
AND I STANDS BY MY MANS.

86
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,176
>> WELL, THANK YOU FOR COMING.
SIR?

87
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:09,490
>> MAY I DO A QUICK SOLILOQUY
FROM A TENNESSEE PLA--

88
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,494
>> SURE.
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.
>> OKAY.

89
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:19,600
I WAS ALWAYS A SHY CHILD.
I KEPT TO MYSELF MOSTLY.

90
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,822
MY ONLY FRIENDS WERE MY GLASS
ANIMALS.

91
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:27,814
MAMMA SAID, GO TO TYPING
SCHOOL LAURA,
SO YOU CAN CATCH
YOURSELF A GOOD HUSBAND,

92
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:29,828
BUT I'M
JUST TOO TERRIBLY SHY.

93
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:32,926
EXCEPT WITH MY GLASS ANIMALS.

94
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:35,774
>> THANK YOU, LINDSEY.

95
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:38,648
THIS IS RARE AT MY RALLIES.

96
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:41,797
WE'VE GOT SOMEONE FROM THE TECH
WORLD, TOO

97
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:47,230
IN CONGRESS, IN THESE CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS,
HE GOT
HIS ASS COMPLETELY OWNED BY AOC,

98
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,586
WHICH MEANS HE'S ONE OF US NOW.

99
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:51,984
PLEASE WELCOME MARK ZUCKERBERG.

100
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,452
>> HELLO.
PROJECT.

101
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,266
EYE CONTACT.

102
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,596
FRIENDLY LAUGH.

103
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:11,157
>> MARK, I WANT TO THANK
FACEBOOK FOR RUNNING OUR RUSSIAN
CAMPAIGN FOR US.

104
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:15,765
FACEBOOK ISN'T PRO‐RUSSIA, IT'S
JUST NOT ANTI‐RUSSIA.

105
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:19,200
>> I'M SURE THAT NUANCE WILL
REALLY REGISTER WITH THE PEOPLE.

106
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,423
>> LOOK, FACEBOOK ONLY CARES
ABOUT THE TRUTH.

107
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:26,696
THAT'S WHY WE'VE CREATED AN
INDEPENDENT FACT‐CHECKING REVIEW
BOARD THAT'S EXTREMELY RIGOROUS.

108
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:30,712
>> OH, YEAH, I'M ON THAT.
IT'S DOPE.
I LET EVERYTHING THROUGH.

109
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:34,067
>> THANK YOU, ZUCKMAN!
>> ANGRY DAB!

110
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:39,245
>> AND THIS GENTLEMEN HAS BEEN
WAITING PATIENTLY, ALL NIGHT TO
SAY SOMETHING.

111
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,575
YES, YOU SIR, PLEASE COME UP HERE.

112
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:51,320
YES, HELLO, AMERICA.
>> BILL CLINTON, EVERYBODY!

113
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,438
WHY ARE YOU ‐‐ BILL, WHY ARE YOU
AT A TRUMP RALLY?

114
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:58,148
>> IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
I JUST FOLLOWED THE PARTY.

115
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:02,524
BUT, MAN, I WISH I WOULD HAVE
KNOWN THAT A PRESIDENT COULD BE
ON THE ROAD LIKE THIS, DOING
RALLIES.

116
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:08,468
CAN YOU IMAGINE?
OH, MY LORD, I WOULD NEVER COME
HOME.

117
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:12,192
>> BUT, BILL, YOU KNOW I'M
GETTING IMPEACHED, RIGHT?
>> YOU ARE?

118
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,552
YOU DIRTY DOG.

119
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:19,241
>> NO, NO, IT'S NOT FOR THAT.
THEY DON'T MIND WHEN I DO THAT,
TRUST ME.

120
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:23,182
>> WELL, THAT IS PROGRESS.

121
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:26,170
OKAY, THANKS, BILL.

122
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,503
I WANT TO BRING UP A NEW FRIEND
OF MINE.
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN OF TURKEY.

123
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:35,432
HELLO

124
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:37,247
>> IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU,
DONALD.

125
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:40,414
COME ON, GIVE THIS TURKEY SOME
GRAVY.

126
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:47,208
DON'T WORRY, WE'RE TREATING THE
KURDS REALLY WELL.
>> GREAT STUFF.

127
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,923
ERDOGAN AND I ARE SUCH GOOD
FRIENDS NOW.

128
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:53,929
>> YES, IT'S LIKE WHEN FRANCO
AND MUSSOLINI WOULD TAKE
VACATIONS TOGETHER.

129
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:59,091
>> OF COURSE.
SOME PEOPLE LIKE OUR GENERALS OR
VA-GENERALS, AS I CALL THEM,

130
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:01,228
ARE MAD THAT WE PULLED OUT OF
SYRIA.

131
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:05,589
>> USUALLY PEOPLE ARE MAD WHEN
YOU DON'T PULL OUT.

132
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:07,413
>> THIS GUY'S INCREDIBLE.

133
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:11,638
BUT, AGAIN, I HAVE NOTHING TO
GAIN FINANCIALLY FROM THIS
DECISION.

134
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:16,180
>> NOW, HOW WOULD HE PROFIT FROM
THIS?
HE'S A TERRIBLE BUSINESSMAN AND
VERY POOR.

135
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,430
>> WELL, NO, ACTUALLY, I'M-- I'M RICH.

136
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,966
>> YEAH, RIGHT, YOU ONLY HAVE
WHAT, 100 BILLION?

137
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:23,218
>> WELL, NOT EXACTLY, BUT IT'S
DEFINITELY BILLIONS.

138
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:25,300
>> HE'S BEING MODEST.
I'M SURE IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

139
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,400
SHOW THEM YOUR TAX RETURNS.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
STOPPING BY.

140
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,364
>> AND WE'RE STILL WORKING ON
GETTING THAT DIRT ON BIDEN,

141
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:35,597
BUT
I WANTED TO THROW OUT THAT WE
COULD JUST MAKE HIM DISAPPEAR.

142

VERY BIG HAS JUST HAPPENED,"

A HEARING ROOM DURING TESTIMONY
DURING THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY,

SO CALM AND
MEASURED AND HE TOLD US NOT TO
WORRY.

I'M LIKE, WAIT, DID THIS GUY
