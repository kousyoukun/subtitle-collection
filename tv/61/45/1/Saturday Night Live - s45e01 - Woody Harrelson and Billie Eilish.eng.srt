1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:03,425
OVAL

2
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:14,244
>>> GET ME RUDY GIULIANI ON THE
PHONE.

3
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:18,514
>> OH, HEY, MR. TRUMP.
WHAT'S NEW?

4
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:22,770
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT'S NEW,
RUDY?
I'M BEING IMPEACHED.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,582
IT'S THE GREATEST PRESIDENTIAL
HARASSMENT OF ALL TIME.

6
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:30,238
I WOULD KNOW.
I'M LIKE THE PRESIDENT OF
HARASSMENT.

7
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,336
>> YOU GOTTA RELAX, MR. TRUMP.
WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT.

8
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:38,578
NOBODY'S GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT
OUR ILLEGAL SIDE DEALINGS WITH
THE UKRAINE.
>> GOOD.

9
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:42,245
>> OR HOW WE TRIED TO COVER UP
THOSE SIDE DEALINGS.
>> GREAT.

10
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:44,510
>> OR HOW WE PLANNED TO COVER UP
THE COVER‐UP.

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,526
>> RUDY, WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT
NOW?
>> I'M ON CNN RIGHT NOW.

12
00:00:49,526 --> 00:00:51,285
LET ME PUT YOU ON SPEAKER.

13
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:55,500
>> RUDY, GET OUT OF THERE.
AND WHATEVER YOU DO, STAY OFF
THE PHONE.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,899
I'VE GOT ANOTHER CALL.

15
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,541
WHO'S THIS?
>> IT'S ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR.

16
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:05,560
>> BILL, I'M REALLY STARTING TO WORRY.
>> WELL, STAY CALM, MR.
PRESIDENT.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,445
I KNOW THINGS LOOK BAD RIGHT
NOW.
BUT I GOT OUR TOP GUY ON THIS.

18
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:11,870
>> GOOD.
WELL, LET'S GET HIM ON THE
PHONE, TOO.

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,752
>> HELLO!
>> DAMN IT, NOT RUDY!

20
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:19,645
OH, HEY, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> RUDY, YOU'RE NOT STILL ON
CNN, ARE YOU?

21
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:21,604
>> OF COURSE NOT.
>> GOOD.

22
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:24,634
>> I'M ON THE "JOE ROGAN
PODCAST."

23
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:28,345
>> RUDY, HANG UP THE PHONE AND
GET OUT OF THERE.

24
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:32,549
>> BILL, YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO
NEED SOMEBODY TO TAKE THE BLAME
FOR THIS.

25
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,071
>> YEAH.
BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO FIND
A SACRIFICIAL PATSY THAT WILL DO
ANYTHING YOU SAY?

26
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:42,412
NOT IT.
>> DON'T WORRY, I'VE GOT THE
PERFECT STOOGE.

27
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:47,885
>> HELLO?
>> BIG MIKE, HOW'S CHURCH GOING?

28
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:50,169
STILL WAITING ON WHAT'S HIS FACE
TO COME BACK?

29
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:53,502
>> YOU MEAN JESUS, SIR?
>> YEAH. THAT'S THE GUY. SURE.

30
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:57,998
LISTEN, I'M JUST CALLING
ABOUT THIS WHOLE UKRAINE
WHISTLE‐BLOWER THING.

31
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:00,010
IT'S LOOKING PRETTY BAD FOR YOU.

32
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,924
>> FOR ME?
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BROKE THE
LAW.

33
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:06,596
>> HEY WAIT A MINUTE.
DON'T TRY TO DRAG ME INTO YOUR
MESS.

34
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:09,153
HOLD ON MIKE, I'M GETTING A CALL FROM
THE BOYS.

35
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:10,714
HELLO.

36
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,985
>> DAD, IT'S YOUR SONS.

37
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:16,214
>> AND ERIC.

38
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:20,631
>> DAD, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THE
LAMESTREAM MEDIA'S

39
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:25,279
FOCUSED ON
YOU AND NOT ON THE CORRUPTION OF
JOE BIDEN'S SON.

40
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:29,885
>> I KNOW.
BY THE WAY, DID YOU TAKE CARE OF
THAT THING IN RUSSIA FOR ME?

41
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:32,999
>> HA-HA. WHAT THING IN RUSSIA?

42
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,901
>> THE TREASON.
>> ERIC!

43
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,229
>> HANG ON, BOYS, I'M GETTING A
VERY IMPORTANT CALL FROM THE
CHAIRMAN.

44
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,874
CHAIRMAN KIM.
>> WAZZZUP!

45
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:50,657
>> THANKS FOR GETTING BACK TO
ME.
I NEED SOME ADVICE.

46
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:53,133
HOW DO YOU HANDLE A
WHISTLEBLOWER?

47
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:58,882
>> OH, THAT'S EASY.
YOU HAVE A BIG OCEAN IN YOUR
COUNTRY?
>> YES.

48
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:02,331
>> SEND WHISTLE‐BLOWER TO THE
BOTTOM OF THERE.

49
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:06,174
>> OH, WOW.
I WISH MY COUNTRY WAS AS COOL AS
YOUR COUNTRY.

50
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:09,238
HANG ON.
I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS.

51
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:12,615
KANYE, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN MY MAN?

52
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:15,118
>> A LOT BETTER, BRO, ACTUALLY.

53
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:18,805
YOU REMEMBER THOSE PILLS I WAS
SUPPOSED TO TAKE, HUH?

54
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:22,183
IT TURNS OUT I'M SUPPOSED TO
TAKE THEM EVERY DAY.

55
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:25,060
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
>> THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.

56
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,565
>> ACTUALLY, THAT'S THE REASON
I'M CALLING YOU.

57
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:31,266
I DON'T THINK WE CAN BE FAM
NO MORE, FAM.

58
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,152
>> WHAT? WHY NOT?

59
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:34,975
>> GIVE ME THE PHONE.

60
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:36,739
ONLY IN AMERICA.

61
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,749
>> DON KING, DON'T TELL ME YOU
DUDES ARE PARTYING WITHOUT ME.

62
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:42,631
IS RODMAN THERE AND TYSON TOO?

63
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:46,987
>> YEAH.
WE WERE JUST HAVING AN EMERGENCY
MEETING OF THE BLACK
WHACKADOOS.

64
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:51,577
AND WE ALL DECIDED THAT THIS
WHOLE IMPEACHMENT THING IS
HURTING OUR BRAND.

65
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:55,855
>> OH, DON'T BAIL ON ME NOW.
I NEED MY URBANS.

66
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,518
KANYE, JUST TELL ME WHO YOU WANT
OUT OF JAIL THIS TIME.

67
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:04,543
ASAP ROCKY AGAIN?
OR HOW ABOUT THAT LITTLE GIRL
TERIYAKI 69?

68
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,911
>> LOOK FAM, WE GOT TO GO.
SAY GOODBYE TO THE DOUCHEBAG.

69
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:15,182
>> YEAH.
TERRENCE HOWARD IS UP ON THE ROOF
WITH AN UMBRELLA
TRYING TO PROVE
THAT GRAVITY DON'T EXIST.

70
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:16,908
ONLY IN AMERICA.

71
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,114
>> WAIT.

72
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:23,614
THIS WHISTLEBLOWER'S STARTING
TO RUIN EVERYTHING FOR ME.

73
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:27,204
HELLO?
>> WITCH HUNT!

74
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:29,320
>> HEY! JUDGE JEANINE.

75
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,140
THINGS ARE NOT GOING SO GREAT.

76
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,914
I'M REALLY FEELING DOWN.
I COULD REALLY USE A PEP TALK.

77
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:37,831
>> WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'VE
COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

78
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:42,556
WHO'S MY SPECIAL BEAUTIFUL BOY?
>> I AM.

79
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:48,393
>> WHO MAKES EVERY WOMAN'S EYES
POP OUT OF HER SKULL AND GO

80
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:52,139
>> I DO.
>> DAMN RIGHT YOU DO.

81
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:58,333
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT DUMPS LIKE A
TRUCK TRUCK AND THIGHS LIKE WHAT
WHAT.

82
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,760
>> THANKS.
I REALLY NEEDED THAT.

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,360
THIS WHISTLE‐BLOWER THING, IT
JUST WON'T GO AWAY.

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,058
>> WELL, IF YOU REALLY WANT
SOMEONE TO GO AWAY, YOU KNOW WHO
TO CALL.

85
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,559
>> RIGHT.
THAT'S GENIUS.
I'LL CALL HIM RIGHT NOW.

86
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:15,056
>> HELLO?

87
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:23,731
>> YES.
IS THIS RAY DONOVAN?

88
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:27,787
>> EXCUSE ME?
>> RAY DONOVAN THE FIXER?

89
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:31,344
THE GUY WHO TAKES CARE OF STUFF
WINK WINK?

90
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,826
>> I TOLD YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
RAY DONOVAN IS A FICTIONAL
CHARACTER.

91
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:40,188
I'M LIEV SCHREIBER, THE ACTOR.

92
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:45,252
>> OH, OF COURSE.
RIGHT.
I KNEW THAT.

93
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:48,519
BUT IF YOU CAN'T DO IT, CAN
YOU CONNECT ME WITH JOHN WICK?

94
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,084
>> HE'S FAKE.
HE'S FAKE TOO, MR. PRESIDENT.

95
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:55,800
>> WHAT ABOUT LIAM NEESON?
>> LI-- OH-- ACTUALLY, LIAM MIGHT DO IT.

96
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,800
>> FINE.
THAT'S GOOD.
I'LL GET HIM.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

97
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,365
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

98
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:43,241
MUSICAL GUEST
BILLIE EILISH,

99
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:48,583
AND YOUR HOST ‐‐
WOODY HARRELSON.

100
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:57,708
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ‐‐
WOODY HARRELSON.

101
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:24,599
>>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

102
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,217
WHAT AN HONOR TO BE HERE ON THIS STAGE

103
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:31,171
HOSTING THE SEASON
PREMIERE OF "SATURDAY NIGHT
LIVE."

104
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:37,887
NOW, I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR A
LONG TIME.

105
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,913
AND I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU I'M THE
SAME OLD WOODY YOU KNOW AND
LOVE.

106
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:45,375
BUT NEVER BEFORE IN THE 34 YEARS

107
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:50,136
SINCE THE MANTLE OF FAME WAS
THRUST UPON THESE OVERBROAD SHOULDERS

108
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:52,581
HAVE I BEEN WHAT I AM
NOW.

109
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:55,082
A FASHIONISTA.

110
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,519
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

111
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:01,894
I'M A DAMN COVER BOY.

112
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:06,314
THE BEST‐DRESSED LIST IS NEW
TERRITORY FOR ME.

113
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:11,887
I'VE BEEN ON THE WORST‐DRESSED
LIST MANY TIMES.
FOR GOOD REASON.

114
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,611
YOU KNOW, I NEVER ‐‐ I NEVER
USED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I WORE.

115
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:20,544
I GUESS I WAS ANTI‐FASHION.

116
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:24,465
BECAUSE IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME
THERE WERE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
TO FOCUS ON.

117
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:28,291
THE ICE IS MELTING.
THE AMAZON IS BURNING.

118
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,570
OUR WATER, FOOD, AND AIR ARE
POLLUTED.

119
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,586
BUT NOW THAT I'M A FASHIONISTA
ALL THAT'S FORGOTTEN.

120
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:39,485
BECAUSE NOW I CARE ABOUT ONE
THING AND ONE THING ONLY.

121
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:42,002
LOOKING GOOD.

122
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:50,099
SO I ASKED MY BUDDY DAPPER DAN
TO REALIZE MY DREAM OF THE
ULTIMATE IN EVENINGWEAR.

123
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:55,140
AND I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS
TUX, BY THE WAY.

124
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:17,753
PAJAMAS!
THEIR TIME HAS COME.

125
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:21,140
NOW, I'VE BEEN AN ACTOR FOR A
LONG TIME.

126
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,146
I USUALLY PLAY MURDERERS OR THE
PEOPLE THEY MURDER.

127
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:30,314
SO I'M USED TO SAYING OTHER
PEOPLE'S WORDS.

128
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:33,799
I'LL EVEN DO IT LATER IN THE
SHOW.
YOU'LL SEE.

129
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,649
BUT THE MONOLOGUE IS THE ONLY
TIME I'M SPEAKING FOR MYSELF.

130
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:42,890
NOW, WRITERS HERE KEPT OFFERING
TO HELP ME TO MAKE SURE I DON'T
SAY THE WRONG THINGS.

131
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,021
BUT AS A FASHION ICON

132
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,238
I'M POISED.

133
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:53,666
I DON'T WEAR THE WRONG THING.
AND I DON'T SAY THE WRONG THING.

134
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,369
I MEAN I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY.

135
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,950
I DIDN'T JUST GET OFF THE BOAT.

136
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,034
OH, GEEZ.
THAT'S IRONIC.

137
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:06,585
THAT SOUNDS LIKE I'M SLANDERING
IMMIGRANTS.
I'M NOT.

138
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:10,511
I THINK IMMIGRANTS MAKE THIS
COUNTRY GREAT.

139
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,122
BUT LET'S FACE IT.
MOST OF THEM DON'T COME BY BOAT
ANYMORE.

140
00:11:21,122 --> 00:11:23,707
YOU KNOW, THEY JUST WALK RIGHT
IN.
RIGHT?

141
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:29,156
WE SEE THAT EVERY DAY ON THE
NEWS.
WELL, FOX NEWS ANYWAY.

142
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:36,009
OH, GEEZ.
IF WHAT I JUST SAID OFFENDED FOX
NEWS VIEWERS, I APOLOGIZE.

143
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:40,945
AND IF I HURT THE ONE FOX VIEWER
WHO IS ALSO AN IMMIGRANT,

144
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:44,649
WELL,
I APOLOGIZE TO YOU, MADAM FIRST
LADY.

145
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,133
BUT SHE IS AN IMMIGRANT.

146
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:55,679
YOU KNOW, A WHITE IMMIGRANT.
BUT I GUESS THAT STILL COUNTS.

147
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,691
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE
WORRIED ABOUT MEXICO

148
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:02,649
BECAUSE THE
CHINESE ARE TAKING OVER
EVERYTHING.

149
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:05,361
THEY TOOK OVER MY WHOLE HOUSE.

150
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:08,672
MY WIFE'S ASIAN.
MY DAUGHTERS ARE ASIAN.

151
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:12,500
AND I CAN SAY THIS BECAUSE I'M
ASIAN.

152
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,849
CAUCASIAN.

153
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:19,838
YOU KNOW ME.
I'M STRAIGHTFORWARD.

154
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:22,118
I DON'T PUSSYFOOT AROUND.

155
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:27,146
OH, MY GOD.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY PUSSYFOOT.

156
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,386
I MISSPOKE THERE.

157
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:34,858
AND IF I HURT ANYONE WHO HAS
PUSSYFEET

158
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:38,005
I APOLOGIZE TO YOU
PEOPLE.

159
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:41,377
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY YOU
PEOPLE.

160
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:43,694
I'M JUST MAKING IT WORSE.
OKAY?

161
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:45,869
SO MAYBE LET'S JUST SKIP AHEAD.

162
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:48,468
YEAH.
NEXT CARD.

163
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:52,008
NEXT ONE.
KEEP GOING.

164
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:54,545
OH, THANK GOD I DIDN'T SAY THAT
ONE.

165
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:58,077
YOU KNOW WHAT, WALLY, JUST DROP
ALL THE CARDS.
OKAY?

166
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:03,392
LOOK, WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW
TONIGHT.
BILLIE EILISH IS HERE!

167
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:13,727
IF YOU CHOOSE TO STICK AROUND,
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

168
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,452
>>> IT'S THE IMPEACHMENT TOWN
HALL!

169
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,652
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M ERIN BURNETT.

170
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:30,553
THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES HAVE UNITED TOGETHER

171
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:34,444
AND DECIDED TO
HANDLE THE IMPEACHMENT THE ONLY
WAY THEY KNOW HOW.

172
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:37,490
WITH A MUDDLED TEN‐PERSON TOWN
HALL DEBATE.

173
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,745
>> FIRST, PLEASE WELCOME GUY WHO
TRAGICALLY MISREAD OUR
ENTHUSIASM FOR HIM,

174
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:44,774
BETO O'ROURKE.

175
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:53,264
>> YEAH, UH...
THANKS FOR STILL LIKE HAVING ME
AROUND.
THIS IS RAD.

176
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,781
NOW, COULD I SAY A FEW WORDS IN
EIGHTH GRADE SPANISH?

177
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:58,764
>> WE REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME FOR
THAT.

178
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:07,622
>> NEXT, HE WAS ASKED TO BE
INTRODUCED AS THE ASIAN BAD BOY OF TECH,

179
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:10,932
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO
SAY ANDREW YANG.

180
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:14,548
>> YOU THINK MY CANDIDACY IS
GOING WELL?

181
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:20,356
I'M LITERALLY GIVING FREE MONEY
TO PEOPLE AND I'M STILL IN SIXTH
PLACE.

182
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:24,240
>> NEXT, NEW JERSEY SENATOR
CORY BOOKER.

183
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,843
>> I'M BLESSED TO BE HERE.

184
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:31,205
>> AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT
WE'RE LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF
TIME YOU CAN SPEAK

185
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,490
BASED ON HOW
WELL YOU'RE DOING IN THE POLLS.

186
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,075
SO CORY, YOU GET FIVE WORDS.

187
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:40,231
IMPEACH TRUMP NOW BECAUSE
TROUBLE.

188
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:43,836
>> THANK YOU, CORY.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEAVE NOW TO
BEAT TRAFFIC?

189
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:45,827
>> I WOULD.

190
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:52,141
>> NEXT, WE HAVE THE MAYOR OF
SOUTH BEND, INDIANA,
PETE BUTTIGIEG.

191
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,817
>> HI.

192
00:14:55,063 --> 00:15:00,339
>> IT'S BUTTIGIEG, RIGHT?
AM I PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY?
>> SURE.

193
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:06,869
>> AND APPEARING TONIGHT LIVE
VIA ASTRAL PROJECTION IS
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON.

194
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:10,070
>> KONNICHIWA, GIRLFRIEND.

195
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,918
HERE'S HOW I WILL IMPEACH
DONALD TRUMP.

196
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:15,989
I WILL TRAP HIS SOUL INSIDE THIS
CRYSTAL.

197
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:19,276
WHICH I SHOULD WARN YOU IS ALSO
A YONI EGG.

198
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:22,280
SO THIS ELECTION, VOTE FOR
MAGIC.

199
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,413
GOOD MORNING.

200
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,004
>> AND NOW LET'S MEET THE ACTUAL
CANDIDATES.

201
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:34,725
SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN.

202
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:42,827
I HOPE YOU GUYS ENJOYED HOT GIRL
SUMMER.

203
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:46,992
BECAUSE NOW IT'S SCHOOL
LIBRARIAN FALL.

204
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:52,590
I HAVE THE ENERGY OF A MOTHER OF
FIVE BOYS WHO ALL PLAY A
DIFFERENT SPORT.

205
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,328
LET'S DO THIS.

206
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,316
>> SENATOR FROM VERMONT
BERNIE SANDERS.

207
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:07,872
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE BACK.

208
00:16:07,872 --> 00:16:11,010
AND TO RUIN THINGS A SECOND
TIME.

209
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:15,086
>> WE ALSO HAVE THE CURRENT
FRONT‐RUNNER IN THE POLLS.

210
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:20,559
HE WENT TO THE DENTIST AND SAID
GIVE ME THE HIGH BEAMS.
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.

211
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:28,505
>> THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY
ANYMORE.
DADDY'S HERE.

212
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:32,816
AMERICA, I SEE YOU.
I HEAR YOU.

213
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:37,647
I SNIFF YOU
AND I HUG YOU FROM BEHIND.

214
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:42,774
NOW, AS I ASK ANYTIME I WALK INTO A ROOM,

215
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:47,247
WHERE AM I AND WHAT
THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?

216
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:52,897
>> WE'D ALSO LIKE TO WELCOME
CALIFORNIA SENATOR
KAMALA HARRIS.

217
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:09,393
>> NOW, ERIN, THAT LITTLE GIRL
YOU JUST INTRODUCED ‐‐

218
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:12,582
THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS ME.

219
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:14,534
>> YES, I KNOW, SENATOR.

220
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:19,422
>> OKAY.
JUST CHECKING.
BECAUSE I'M NOT JUST THAT LITTLE
GIRL.

221
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:23,087
I'M ALSO AMERICA'S COOL AUNT.

222
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:27,898
A FUN AUNT.
I CALL THAT A FUNT.

223
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:33,727
THE KIND OF FUNT THAT WILL GIVE
YOU WEED BUT THEN ARREST YOU FOR
HAVING WEED.

224
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:37,945
CAN I WIN THE PRESIDENCY?
PROBABLY NOT.
I DON'T KNOW.

225
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:41,580
CAN I SUCCESSFULLY SEDUCE A MUCH
YOUNGER MAN?

226
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,396
YOU BETTER FUNTING BELIEVE IT.

227
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:51,843
>> OKAY.
THANK YOU, SENATOR HARRIS.
AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR
CANDIDATES.

228
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:55,072
OUR FIRST QUESTION IS FROM
DENISE REYNOLDS.

229
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:57,716
>> MY QUESTION IS FOR SENATOR
HARRIS.

230
00:17:57,716 --> 00:18:01,213
YOU SAID YOU'D GO PAST
IMPEACHMENT AND PROSECUTE TRUMP
DIRECTLY.

231
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,907
DO YOU STILL STAND BY THAT?
>> OH, HELL YEAH.

232
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,935
I'M A SMOOTH‐TALKING LADY
LAWYER.

233
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,927
I'M RIZZOLI AND I'M ISLES.

234
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:13,390
I'M A WALKING, TALKING TNT SHOW.

235
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,241
DON'T YOU WANT FOUR MORE YEARS
OF ME DRESSING DOWN OUR ENEMIES
LIKE THIS?

236
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:21,341
YOU CALL THAT HUMAN RIGHTS,
CHINA?

237
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:24,851
I CALL IT HUMAN WRONGS.

238
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:28,981
KAMALA, SUNDAYS ON TNT.

239
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:34,846
>> AND OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM
CALVIN MILLETT.

240
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:38,580
>> YEAH, MY QUESTION IS FOR
SENATOR SANDERS.

241
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,000
THE DEMOCRATS SAID THEY'RE GOING
FORWARD WITH IMPEACHMENT QUICKLY

242
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,876
BUT DO YOU HAVE THE
PATIENCE TO SEE THAT THROUGH?

243
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:49,211
>> PATIENCE?
DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT PATIENCE.

244
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:53,391
IT TAKES ME 40 MINUTES TO FIGURE
OUT HOW TO TURN ON THE TV

245
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:55,690
EVERY
SINGLE TIME!

246
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,232
IF I ACCIDENTALLY HIT INPUT,
THAT'S A WHOLE DAY.

247
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:03,498
GONE.
GONE.

248
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:10,366
SOMETIMES I SIT ON THE PORCH AND
DO LITERALLY NOTHING FOR SIX
HOURS.

249
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:14,249
I DON'T TALK TO PEOPLE.
I DON'T LOOK AT STUFF.

250
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:20,049
I JUST SIT SO STILL PEOPLE GET
SCARED...

251
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:23,094
AND CALL 911.

252
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,314
AND NOT FOR THE AMBULANCE.
FOR THE CORONER.

253
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:31,134
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR SANDERS.

254
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:32,979
NEXT QUESTION.
YES?

255
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:37,539
>> WHAT IF JOE BIDEN GETS
IMPLICATED IN THIS UKRAINE
SCANDAL IN SOME WAY?

256
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:40,432
>> OH, NO.

257
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:45,265
THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE.
NOT JOE BIDEN.

258
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:49,343
>> VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, DO YOU
HAVE A RESPONSE?

259
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:52,397
>> DO I HAVE TIME FOR A VERY
LONG STORY?

260
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:57,091
>> YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS.
>> I'M GOING TO BLOW RIGHT BY
THAT.

261
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:02,456
THE YEAR IS 1962.
I'M LIFEGUARDING.

262
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:05,326
NO SHIRT.
TAN CHEST.

263
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:07,591
MEDIUM NIPS.

264
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:12,512
OH, AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT IT WAS A SEGREGATED POOL,

265
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:15,722
JUST
TO PUT EVERYONE ON THE EDGE FOR
THE REST OF THE STORY.

266
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:20,292
SO I'M LIFEGUARDING AND WHO
WALKS IN BUT CORN POP?

267
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:22,303
>> I'M SORRY, CORN POP?

268
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:25,757
>> SO I SEE CORN POP,

269
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,453
AND HE'S CARRYING A SWITCHBLADE

270
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:32,722
NEXT TO A KID NAMED DRUMSTICK WEARING
BRASS KNUCKLES.

271
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:35,460
AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THE RACES OF THE KIDS,

272
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,328
BUT FROM THE
NICKNAMES AND THE TYPES OF WEAPONS
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
FILL IN THE BLANKS.

273
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:42,291
>> MR. VICE PRESIDENT ‐‐

274
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:46,389
>> OKAY, SORRY, ANYWAY, LONG
STORY SHORT ‐‐

275
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:48,474
BARACK.

276
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:54,527
>> HEY.
REMEMBER WHEN EVERYONE THOUGHT I
WAS GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO
SEEMED OUT OF TOUCH?

277
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:57,634
THIS GUY MAKES ME LOOK LIKE
DRAKE.

278
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:02,478
>> MR. VICE PRESIDENT, I NEED TO
SAY SOMETHING TO YOU.

279
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:08,822
THAT CORN POP IN YOUR STORY WAS
ME.

280
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,029
THAT LITTLE CORN POP WAS ME.

281
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:20,534
CORN POP.
TUESDAYS AT 10:00 ON USA.

282
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:25,262
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S JUST GO TO CLOSING
STATEMENTS.

283
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:28,623
BUT JUST FROM THE FOUR
CANDIDATES WHO ACTUALLY HAVE A
SHOT AT THIS THING.

284
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:30,618
SENATOR WARREN, WE'LL START WITH
YOU.

285
00:21:30,618 --> 00:21:33,545
>> LOOK.
HEY, LOOK.

286
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:36,438
AMERICA, I'M FUN, RIGHT?

287
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:39,946
I'M LIKE A BRISK WALK.

288
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:43,029
I KNOW ALL THE BIG DONORS ARE
TURNING AGAINST ME.

289
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:45,302
BUT I'M FOCUSED ON THE SMALL
DONORS.

290
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:49,101
$3 FROM ANDREW AT THE CIRCLE K.

291
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:53,135
53 CENTS FROM A THIRD‐GRADER IN
ILLINOIS.

292
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:57,709
$800 FROM AN IMMIGRANT AND
STAY‐AT‐HOME MOM NAMED MELANIA.

293
00:21:57,709 --> 00:22:01,275
SHE FIGHTIN' THE FIGHT.

294
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,458
>> OKAY.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO VICE
PRESIDENT BIDEN.

295
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:10,012
>> LOOK.
I'M LIKE PLASTIC STRAWS.
I'VE BEEN AROUND FOREVER.

296
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:13,520
I'VE ALWAYS WORKED.
BUT NOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME?

297
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:23,523
DRINK UP, AMERICA.

298
00:22:23,523 --> 00:22:26,526
IN CLOSING I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY
ONE MORE TIME...

299
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:28,331
BARACK.

300
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:31,705
>> SENATOR SANDERS, CLOSING
STATEMENT?

301
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:35,783
>> AMERICA.
HERE IS MY PROMISE TO YOU.

302
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:39,152
FREE COLLEGE.
FREE HEALTH CARE.

303
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:43,656
FREE REFILLS ON ANY MEDIUM SIZE
SOFT DRINK.

304
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,741
LAST TIME MY SLOGAN WAS "FEEL
THE BERN."

305
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,883
THIS TIME IT'S "LET'S BERN THIS
PLACE TO THE GROUND!"

306
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:57,097
>> SENATOR HARRIS, YOUR CLOSING
STATEMENT, PLEASE.

307
00:22:57,097 --> 00:23:01,331
>> THIS FUNT WOULD LIKE TO TAKE
THIS OPPORTUNITY

308
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:04,322
TO SPEAK
DIRECTLY TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.

309
00:23:04,322 --> 00:23:09,668
MR. TRUMP, NO ONE IS ABOVE THE
LAW.

310
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:14,595
ABOVE THE LAW.
THURSDAYS ON NBC.

311
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:16,711
GONK GONK.

312
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:22,527
>> AND THOSE ARE OUR CHOICES,
AMERICA.
GOOD LUCK.

313
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:34,051
>>> YOU'RE TUNED IN TO SUN'S OUT
NEVADA.

314
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:36,159
THANKS YOU, GUYS!

315
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:39,735
>> WELCOME BACK.
WEATHER AND TRAFFIC ARE JUST
AHEAD.

316
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:42,015
SPOILER ALERT ‐‐ THERE'S
NEITHER.

317
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:47,400
>> AND LATER, AUTHOR DAV PILKEY
JOINS US TO CHAT ABOUT HIS NEW CHILDREN'S BOOK,

318
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,069
"CAPTAIN
UNDERPANTS: RISE OF HERSHEY
SQUIRT."

319
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:53,445
EXCITED TO PICK HIS BRAIN.

320
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:58,307
>> BUT FIRST, TIME FOR "JO ON
THE GO" WITH OUR ROVING REPORTER JO ANN BATTING

321
00:23:58,307 --> 00:24:02,343
WHO'S LIVE ON
INTERSTATE 15 WITH HER YUMMIEST
SCOOP YET.

322
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:07,278
>> THANKS, GUYS.
WELL, IN BETWEEN LOS ANGELES AND LAS VEGAS

323
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:12,017
A NEW ATTRACTION WILL
OFFER ROAD TRIPPERS A CHEESY
PHOTO OP.

324
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:16,424
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST CHEETO
MUSEUM HAS IT'S GRAND OPENING
TODAY.

325
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:20,400
AND I AM HERE NOW WITH THE PROUD
OWNERS, THE HODDER FAMILY.

326
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,822
REESE, LINETTE, AND THEIR SON
P RYAN.

327
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:26,019
CONGRATS ON YOUR BIG DAY.

328
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:29,809
NOW REESE, YOU FIRST HAD THE
IDEA FOR ALL THIS FIVE YEARS
AGO.

329
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:35,389
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO LOOK AT THAT
GIGANTIC CHEETO TODAY?
BESIDES HUNGRY.

330
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:42,367
>> WELL, YOU'RE QUICK.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ON TV AND I
OWN THE CHEETO.

331
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:47,373
ANYWAY, IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.
IT TOOK A LOT OF WORK.

332
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:52,449
AND OUR ENTIRE SAVINGS TO BUY
THE CHEETO AND BUILD THE MUSEUM.

333
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:56,119
BUT TODAY I THINK IT'S SAFE TO
SAY IT WAS WORTH IT.

334
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,789
RIGHT, SWEETHEART?
>> SURE.

335
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:04,394
>> LYNETTE, ARE YOU AS EXCITED
AS YOUR HUSBAND?

336
00:25:04,394 --> 00:25:06,103
>> NO.

337
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:11,242
>> NOW, P. RYAN, I GOT TO ASK.
HOW DO YOU KEEP FROM EATING THIS
THING?

338
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:15,050
>> I ACTUALLY GET THAT QUESTION
A LOT.
AND I ALWAYS SAY, YOU KNOW,

339
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:20,135
I
WONDER IF THEY ASK PEOPLE
WORK AT THE LOUVRE IF THEY WANT
TO EAT THE MONA LISA.
YOU KNOW?

340
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:24,371
>> WELL, NO, BECAUSE IT'S A
PAINTING AND NOT A GIANT CHEETO.

341
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:28,200
>> RIGHT.
YEAH.
BUT IT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING.
>> IT'S NOT.

342
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,468
LATER ON, THE CHEETO WILL BE MEASURED

343
00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:36,123
BY THIS JUDGE FROM THE
GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS,
MR. HUNTINGTON BOOTH.

344
00:25:36,123 --> 00:25:37,800
>> DR. HUNTINGTON BOOTH.

345
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,258
AND I MUST SAY THIS CHEETO IS
SPECTACULAR.

346
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:45,166
I ONCE SAW A 40‐FOOT HOT DOG
THAT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

347
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:48,428
AND I AM GETTING A VERY SIMILAR
FEELING FROM THE CHEETO.

348
00:25:48,428 --> 00:25:52,741
>> EXCITING STUFF.
ALRIGHT, WE'LL SEE YOU SOON FOR THE
OFFICIAL MEASUREMENT, MR. BOOTH.

349
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:54,923
>> DR. BOOTH!

350
00:25:54,923 --> 00:26:01,511
>> WELL, IT'S ALMOST 9 O'CLOCK.
IS IT TIME TO OFFICIALLY OPEN
THE MUSEUM FOR THE FIRST TIME?

351
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:04,726
>> IT SURE IS.
OH, BOY.

352
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:07,373
SON, YOU WANT TO TURN ON THE
FAN?

353
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:10,734
>> OKAY.
FANS ARE ON, DAD.

354
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:15,300
>> LADIES AND GERMS, THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST CHEETO MUSEUM

355
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,688
IS
OFFICIALLY OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

356
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:22,024
GOD BLESS YOU, CHEETO.
I LOVE YOU.

357
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:41,780
>> UH, A LITTLE HICCUP OVER AT
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST CHEETO
MUSEUM.

358
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,973
>> EVERYTHING OKAY THERE, JO?

359
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:47,154
>> YEAH, EVERYONE'S OKAY.

360
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:51,193
EXCEPT FOR THE CHEETO WHICH FELL
INTO THE FAN.

361
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:56,246
WELL, WE WERE SUPPOSE TO TAKE
THE GUINNESS WORLD RECORD
MEASUREMENT HERE.

362
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:58,601
THAT STILL HAPPENING?
>> NO.

363
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:01,246
>> RIGHT. WELL, NOT THE BEST GRAND
OPENING.

364
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:04,229
HOW YOU DOING REESE?
>> BAD.

365
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:09,024
DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF BACKUP
PLAN?
NO, WE WERE ALL IN ON THE
CHEETO.

366
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:13,500
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT ALL
NEW BUSINESSES GO THROUGH GROWING PAINS

367
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,003
AND I ACTUALLY
THINK THIS CHEETO CAN BE FIXED.
>> WELL, IT CAN'T.

368
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:21,560
>> I STILL THINK PEOPLE WILL
COME ON DOWN.
>> THEY WILL NOT.

369
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,432
NOW, LYNETTE, WHAT'S NEXT FOR
YOU?

370
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:28,302
>> DIVORCE.
>> MAKES SENSE.
I WOULD DO THE SAME.

371
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:30,417
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

372
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:43,311

WEEKEND UPDATE WITH COLIN JOST
AND MICHAEL CHE.

415
00:31:33,031 --> 00:31:36,800
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

416
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:39,190
WELL ‐‐ EASY.

417
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:44,930
THIS WEEK PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS
ACCUSED OF A SHADY MAFIA‐STYLE
SHAKEDOWN OF THE UKRAINE.

418
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:49,205
BUT LUCKILY TRUMP'S LAWYER WAS
ABLE TO SMOOTH IT OVER WITH
PROFESSIONALISM AND CLASS.

419
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:51,988
>> SHUT UP, MORON.
SHUT UP.

420
00:31:51,988 --> 00:31:54,078
>> SHUT UP.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

421
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,878
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, IDIOT.

422
00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:01,362
>> BY THE WAY, IT LOOKS LIKE THE
WORLD'S ANGRIEST GAME OF GUESS
WHO.

423
00:32:01,362 --> 00:32:04,485
AND NOW DEMOCRATS ARE MOVING
TOWARD IMPEACHING TRUMP,

424
00:32:04,485 --> 00:32:07,509
WHICH
SHOULD FEEL LIKE A HUGE HISTORIC MOMENT

425
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,998
BUT WITH TRUMP EVEN
IMPEACHMENT JUST FEELS SILLY.

426
00:32:09,998 --> 00:32:14,059
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE MOVIE "NIXON"
WAS A SERIOUS FILM DIRECTED BY
OLIVER STONE.

427
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:18,811
THE MOVIE ABOUT TRUMP IS GOING
TO BE FROM THE DUDES WHO BROUGHT
YOU "AMERICAN PIE."

428
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:23,935
AND BY THE WAY, THE ONE THING WE
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE ALL WEEK ABOUT THIS IS A
DENIAL.

429
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:28,028
TRUMP JUST KEEPS SAYING THAT ALL
THE INFORMATION IS BAD BECAUSE
IT'S ALL SECONDHAND.

430
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:30,855
IT'S LIKE IF THE COPS ASKED IF
YOU MURDERED SOMEONE

431
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:35,481
AND
INSTAED SAYING NO I DIDN'T YOU
SAID WHO TOLD YOU THAT, RON?

432
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:39,610
>>> ALRIGHT, MAYBE I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND POLITICS WELL

433
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,336
BECAUSE
WHEN THEY SAID TRUMP IS GETTING IMPEACHED

434
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:45,590
I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT
GREAT, TRUMP'S FIRED, LET'S GET
DRUNK.

435
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,911
BUT THEY'RE LIKE NO, HE'S JUST
BEING IMPEACHED BUT HE AIN'T
EXACTLY PEACHED YET.

436
00:32:50,911 --> 00:32:52,930
IT'S STILL GOING TAKE ANOTHER
YEAR OR SO.

437
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,640
AND I'M LIKE DAMN, THAT SUCKS,
LET'S GET DRUNK.

438
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:01,222
I MEAN, THE PRESIDENT IS ONLY A
FOUR‐YEAR JOB BUT IT FEELS LIKE
IT'S TAKING THEM FIVE YEARS TO
JUST FIRE HIS ASS.

439
00:33:01,222 --> 00:33:06,416
IT'S FRUSTRATING.
YOU KNOW, I BET SOMEBODY
EXPLAINED HOW LONG IMPEACHMENT
TAKES TO JOHN WILKES BOOTH

440
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:09,728
AND
HE WAS LIKE OKAY, WELL, WHERE IS
HE AT RIGHT NOW?

441
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:19,061
>>> TRUMP ALSO ATTACKED CNN
FOR SAYING HE SPELLED THE WORD
LITTLE WRONG.

442
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:20,088
LOOK AT THIS INSANITY.

443
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:23,212
"I USED THE WORD LIDDLE', NOT LIDDLE

444
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:26,841
IN DESCRIBING CORRUPT
CONGRESSMAN LIDDLE' ADAM SCHIFF.

445
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:30,100
LOW RATINGS CNN PURPOSELY TOOK THE HYPHEN OUT

446
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,911
AND SAID I
SPELLED THE WORD LITTLE WRONG."

447
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:37,005
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S AN
APOSTROPHE, NOT A HYPHEN.

448
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:42,423
I'M SORRY TO BE A GRAMMAR NAZI.
I KNOW YOU HATE ONE OF THOSE
THINGS.

449
00:33:43,863 --> 00:33:49,332

00:33:49,332 --> 00:33:54,219

IF JOE BIDEN WAS A REPUBLICAN
HE'D BE GETTING THE ELECTRIC
CHAIR.

451
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:59,947
THOUGH IN FAIRNESS BOTH TRUMP
AND BIDEN ARE GOING TO BE IN
ELECTRIC CHAIRS PRETTY SOON.

TRIED TO KILL YOU.

460
00:34:37,573 --> 00:34:41,158
>> THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
>> OH, YOU THINK, BRO?

461
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:44,098
I HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL IN
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

462
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:45,822
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY GOT IN THE
HOSPITAL THERE?

463
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:47,819
>> WHAT?
>> THEY GOT MOFONGO.

464
00:34:56,543 --> 00:35:00,482
AND IN THE IV YOU KNOW WHAT THEY
GIVE YOU?
>> WHAT, LIKE A SALINE SOLUTION?

466
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,654
>> THEY HAVE THAT AT THE
HOSPITAL?
>> AT THE DOMINICAN HOSPITAL
THEY DO.

467
00:35:07,654 --> 00:35:09,871
THAT'S WHY I GO TO THE BOSTON
HOSPITAL NEXT.

468
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:12,000
YEAH, YOU GO WHAT THEY GOT AT THE
BOSTON HOSPITAL?

>> WELL, I HOPE YOU STAY SAFE
FROM NOW ON.
>> ME TOO BRO.

471
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:23,371
THAT'S WHY I'M MORE CAREFUL NOW.
WHEN I GO OUT I WEAR A DISGUISE.

472
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:27,746
I GET THEM ALL FROM THE SAME
PLACE.

BURGER.

479

YOU MEAN THE IMPOSSIBLE BURGER.
>> NO.

480
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,035
POSSIBLE BURGER.

481

BEEF FROM THE BACK OF A PICKUP
TRUCK?

482
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:58,249
IT MIGHT NOT BE REAL MEAT.
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE.

483
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:04,862
>> I'M GLAD YOU'RE STAYING
POSITIVE ABOUT THIS.

00:41:57,245 --> 00:42:00,132
>> AND HOW OLD IS SHE?
IF YOU DO THE MATH ‐‐

569
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:01,697
>> DON'T DO THE MATH!

570
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:04,165
GUYS ‐‐
>> THE VEIN WAS OUT?

571
00:42:04,165 --> 00:42:06,827
>> ENOUGH.
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS.

572
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:11,010
NOW, LET'S GET OUR HEADS IN THE
GAME, OUR EYES ON THE PRIZE, AND
OUR FEET ‐‐

573
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,587
>> HOLD UP.

574
00:42:13,587 --> 00:42:17,016
ARE Y'ALL FOLLOWING ME OR AM I
BACK IN THE SAME ROOM?

575
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:21,240
>> MISS TRINITY, WHEN YOU SAY
THE VEIN WAS OUT ‐‐

576
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,173
>> I MEAN, IT WAS OUT.
IT WAS LIKE MM‐MM,

577
00:42:27,216 --> 00:42:30,110
AND THEN THE TOP WAS LIKE FOLDED

578
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:34,777
AND THEN HE
SAID CALL MY GRANDMA, SHE'LL
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

579
00:42:34,777 --> 00:42:37,455
>> WHY WOULD YOUR GRANDMA KNOW
WHAT TO DO, COACH?

580
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,822
>> SHE'S KNOWN MY BODY THE
LONGEST.

581
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:42,829
>> AND WITH THAT I QUIT.

582
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:46,206
BABE, LOOK WHAT YOU DID.
LEAVE.

583
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:48,225
I CAN'T HAVE YOU TALKING TO ME
ON THE JOB.

584
00:42:48,225 --> 00:42:53,414
>> OH OKAY.
BIG MAN ACTING TOUGH BECAUSE HIS
THING'S IN ONE PIECE AGAIN.

585
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:58,008
BUT DON'T COME CRAWLING BACK TO
ME WHEN IT SCREAMS

586
00:42:58,984 --> 00:43:03,810
WHICH WE KNOW IS GONNA HAPPEN
AND IT'S GONNA FALL OFF
CAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S WHERE IT'S HEADED TOO.

587
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,773
BYE GUYS!

588
00:43:04,773 --> 00:43:06,993
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO FALL OFF!

589
00:43:06,993 --> 00:43:11,490
ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN.
I NEED YOU ALL TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT MY THING

590
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,802
AND GET YOUR
HEADS BACK IN THE GAME.

591
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,499
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING I
KNOW ‐‐

592
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:22,149
>> YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP FIGHTING
NO MATTER WHAT.

593
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:27,020
>> COACH, I THINK YOUR THING
MAKING THAT SOUND.
>> I KNOW.

594
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,889
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S SAYING?
WIN.

595
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,748
>> WIN THE GAME.

596
00:43:34,691 --> 00:43:38,179
>> YEAH!
>> LET'S GO.

597
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:42,055
LET'S GO.

598
00:43:42,055 --> 00:43:45,737
>> OH, YEAH.
THAT'S CLEAN OFF.

599
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:57,400
>>> GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO INSIDE THE BELTWAY

600
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,330
WHERE WE
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING UP IN
WASHINGTON.

601
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:01,600
I'M DENISE CRAW.

602
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,903
JOINING ME AS ALWAYS ARE WALTER
DALE FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR.

603
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:09,016
FROM THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS
CONNIE BRASHERES.

604
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:13,867
AND CHAIR OF
AFRICAN‐AMERICAN STUDIES AT
RICE UNIVERSITY, QUINCY MADDOX.

605
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:16,748
WOW, IT'S BEEN A HISTORIC WEEK

606
00:44:16,748 --> 00:44:20,132
AS THE HOUSE LAUNCHED AN
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTO THE
PRESIDENT.

607
00:44:20,132 --> 00:44:23,046
IT'S REALLY SHAKING
WASHINGTON UP.
HASN'T IT, WALTER?

608
00:44:23,046 --> 00:44:28,893
>> IT SURE HAS.
I'VE GOT TO SAY, THIS FEELS LIKE
A REAL TURNING POINT IN THE
TRUMP PRESIDENCY.

609
00:44:28,893 --> 00:44:35,427
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S GRATIFYING TO
SEE OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND
BALANCES FINALLY WORKING THE WAY
IT'S INTENDED.

610
00:44:35,427 --> 00:44:37,803
>> AIN'T NOTHING GONNA HAPPEN.

611
00:44:40,006 --> 00:44:45,573
>> COME ON, QUINCY,
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THERE'S
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS UKRAINE
STORY.

612
00:44:45,573 --> 00:44:51,400
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEEM TO
UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF IT
RIGHT AWAY.

613
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,270
>> YEAH.
I SEE THAT.

614
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,021
BUT AIN'T NOTHING GONNA HAPPEN.

615
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:59,500
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
IT ACTUALLY SEEMS THE PRESIDENT
IS IN REAL TROUBLE HERE.

616
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:04,625
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, UKRAINE IS
LIKELY TO BE ONE OF MANY REASONS
CITED IN THE ARTICLES OF
IMPEACHMENT.

617
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:08,536
I MEAN, THIS ISN'T HIS FIRST
OFFENSE.
OKAY?

618
00:45:08,536 --> 00:45:12,956
I MEAN, REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
FIVE MONTHS AGO.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

619
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:20,988
>> WE BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS
ABOVE THE LAW, INCLUDING THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

620
00:45:20,988 --> 00:45:25,884
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
IS ENGAGED IN A COVER‐UP.

621
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:31,802
>> AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.
THE FULL MUELLER REPORT IS OUT,

622
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:34,623
AND IT CITES TEN INSTANCES OF
OBSTRUCTION.

623
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:37,978
IT'S REALLY SHAKEN WASHINGTON
UP, HASN'T IT, WALTER?

624
00:45:37,978 --> 00:45:44,099
>> IT SURE HAS.
YOU KNOW, THIS FEELS LIKE A REAL
TURNING POINT IN THE TRUMP
PRESIDENCY.

625
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,572
>> AIN'T NOTHING GONNA HAPPEN.

626
00:45:54,674 --> 00:45:58,833
>> OKAY.
WOW.
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT LAST PART.

627
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:01,918
BUT WE ALL MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE MUELLER REPORT

628
00:46:01,918 --> 00:46:05,685
IS BUT ONE
STAIN ON AN ALREADY TARNISHED
PRESIDENCY.

629
00:46:05,685 --> 00:46:10,511
>> I MEAN, THERE'S ALSO THE
GENUFLECTING TO MURDEROUS
DICTATORS.
>> WORD.

630
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:14,114
>> CALLING WHITE SUPREMACISTS
VERY FINE PEOPLE.
>> COME ON.

631
00:46:14,114 --> 00:46:18,128
>> AND LYING ABOUT HUSH MONEY TO
COVER UP AN AFFAIR.
>> FOR REAL?

632
00:46:18,128 --> 00:46:21,251
>> WITH AN ADULT FILM STAR.
>> OH, DAMN!

633
00:46:21,251 --> 00:46:26,696
>> AND THIS NEW STORY ABOUT
TRUMP TELLING THE RUSSIANS
HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ELECTION
INTERFERENCE.

634
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:29,915
>> OH, SNAP.
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE ‐‐

635
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:32,161
AIN'T NOTHING GONNA HAPPEN.

636
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:38,500
>> QUINCY, PLEASE.
THIS UKRAINE EPISODE IS A CLEAR
A VIOLATION OF THE OATH OF OFFICE,

637
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,214
AND THERE ARE
TRANSCRIPTS.

638
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,175
>> UH‐OH.
HERE COME THE TRANSCRIPTS.

639
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,730
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING
AMERICANS LOVE, IT'S READING.

640
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:52,673
>> AND KEEP IN MIND, IMPEACHMENT
GIVES CONGRESS MORE POWERS THAN
THEY PREVIOUSLY HAD.

641
00:46:52,673 --> 00:46:56,974
ADAM SCHIFF SAYS, AND I QUOTE,
"THE BIG CLUB HAS BEEN BROUGHT
OUT."

642
00:46:56,974 --> 00:47:02,105
>> OH, SNAP.
ADAM "THE HAMMER" SCHIFF?
SAID THAT?!

643
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:03,816
WELL, THAT'S ALL YOU HAD TO SAY.

644
00:47:03,816 --> 00:47:06,401
>> QUINCY, YOU KNOW HOW THIS
WORKS.

645
00:47:06,401 --> 00:47:09,403
IT HAPPENED IN WATERGATE.
IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN.

646
00:47:09,403 --> 00:47:13,050
FIRST THEY SEND OUT THE
SUBPOENAS.
THEN THERE'S HEARINGS.

647
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,454
QUINCY.
QUINCY.

648
00:47:15,454 --> 00:47:18,024
QUINCY, STOP.
>> NO, NO, NO.
TELL ME WHAT'S NEXT.

649
00:47:18,024 --> 00:47:21,340
>> PUT DOWN THE POPCORN.
ALRIGHT FINE.
>> THANK YOU.

650
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:25,742
NOW, AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT THIS
WHISTLE‐BLOWER WHO HAS AGREED TO
TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS.

651
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:29,610
>> A WHISTLE‐BLOWER?
OH, HE GOING TO GO MISSING.

652
00:47:30,378 --> 00:47:32,872
>> WHAT?
>> NOTHING.

653
00:47:32,872 --> 00:47:35,967
>> WELL, UNLIKE YOU, I HAVE
FAITH IN THE PROCESS.

654
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:39,667
THE SYSTEM MIGHT TAKE A WHILE,
BUT IT IS WORKING.

655
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,724
>> OH, IT'S WORKING.
FOR TRUMP.

656
00:47:41,724 --> 00:47:43,742
'CAUSE AIN'T NOTHING GONNA
HAPPEN.

657
00:47:43,742 --> 00:47:48,141
>> WELL, MR. MADDOX, IN LIFE
SOMETIMES PEOPLE SURPRISE US.

658
00:47:48,141 --> 00:47:53,312
AND I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
SOME REPUBLICANS ARE ABOUT TO
HAVE A MOMENT OF REAL MORAL CLARITY.

659
00:47:53,312 --> 00:47:57,062
>> OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?
NOW LET'S ROLL THAT CLIP
FROM 2016.

660
00:47:57,062 --> 00:47:59,318
>> OKAY.
I'M THE HOST.

661
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,750
>> THEY'RE BRINGING DRUGS.
THEY'RE BRINGING CRIME.

662
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,950
THEY'RE RAPISTS.

663
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,939
>> HE'S A WAR HERO 'CAUSE HE WAS
CAPTURED.

664
00:48:08,939 --> 00:48:11,800
I LIKE PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T
CAPTURED.
OKAY?
I HATE TO TELL YA.

665
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,546
>> YOU OUGHT TO SEE THIS GUY.
"OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
AH."

666
00:48:14,546 --> 00:48:16,604
>> GRAB THEM BY THE [ BLEEP ].

667
00:48:16,604 --> 00:48:19,162
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

668
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,852
>> WOW.
JUST APPALLING.

669
00:48:22,852 --> 00:48:26,162
>> I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD ANY
MAN TALK LIKE THAT.

670
00:48:26,162 --> 00:48:32,329
>> IT'S REVOLTING.
IT FEELS LIKE A REAL TURNING
POINT IN THE TRUMP CANDIDACY.

671
00:48:33,008 --> 00:48:35,199
HE GONNA WIN.

672
00:48:55,529 --> 00:49:01,005
>> MR. MADDOX.
I'LL ADMIT THAT YOU WERE ON TO
SOMETHING BACK THEN.

673
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:05,455
BUT I BELIEVE ‐‐

674
00:49:07,287 --> 00:49:11,723
I BELIEVE THAT THE ARC ‐‐

675
00:49:11,723 --> 00:49:16,846
I BELIEVE THAT THE
ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE IS LONG

676
00:49:16,846 --> 00:49:20,180
BUT IT BENDS TOWARDS
JUSTICE.

677
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,548
>> HEAR HEAR.
>> WELL SAID, DENISE.
