In bed eight o'clock on the dot,
just like you said.

Excuse me, you haven't seen a small
boy - brown hair, freckles,

63
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,739
was playing with some other kids,
have you?

I have not lost our son.

Look, you don't want to blow it
with Santa

73
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:56,219

this year, right?

The victim is Stuart Fullwell,

00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,139
here on a Christmas break
with his fiancee.

112
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:03,099
He got dressed up to go to
the bar for a drink last night.

113
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,019
Half past nine, he headed back
to his bedroom to get changed.

114
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,339
Wasn't seen again until his body was
spotted by one of the other guests.

Yeah, I'm at the airport now.

If I can actually get
out of the taxi.

124
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:56,779
Listen, mate, I don't want to say
it's been the holiday from hell,

125
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,379
but it's not far off.

No, no, the...

127

No, the people are nice enough,

128
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,139
but it's like everything
moves at half the normal speed.

129
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:14,459
Seriously, it's like stepping back
in time.

130

'Scuse me.

131

The important thing is
I managed to change my flight.

00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:22,739
Yeah.

133
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,499
Of course it cost me extra,

134
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,819
but worth it if it gets me
out of here, right?

135
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:29,379
Hello?

136
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,459
Great.

00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,179
You still there?

138
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,459
Yeah, that's the other thing -
the signal out here's terrible.

139
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,659
God knows how they manage.

140
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:44,179
Listen, I'm calling the guv
the second I land, mate,

141
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,019
let him know I'm returning early.
CALL WAITING BEEP

142
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,539
Hang on, mate.

143
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:51,699
That's funny,
that's him calling now.

144
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,339
Listen, let's grab a beer
when I get back, all right?

145
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,779
Yeah, see you.

146
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,539
Guv, I was just talking about you.

147
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:04,659
Yeah, yeah, I am in Saint Marie now,
but I'm...

148
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,819
Me?

149
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:11,059
Listen, guv, I would love to,

150
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,859
but the thing is,
I'm actually leaving early.

151
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:15,419
Can't someone else do it?

152
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:19,859
But I'm actually on the plane
right now.

153
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,339
It's literally about to take off.

154
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,179
Come on, guv, you're not seriously
going to make me

155
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:26,019
get off the plane now, are you?

156
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:38,019
Yeah, no, it's all good, guv.

157
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,699
Like you said, hopefully it'll be
done and dusted

158
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:42,539
and I'll be home in no time.

159
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:43,819
OK.

160
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,059
Unbelievable.

161
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:56,579
<font color="#00ff00">Come on, Ollie, don't be shy.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Tell them what you saw.</font>

162
00:09:58,579 --> 00:09:59,899
<font color="#ffff00">So you're a sheriff?</font>

163
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:03,139
<font color="#00ff00">Me? No, I work</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for the local council.</font>

164
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:05,099
<font color="#00ff00">Oh! Oh, sorry, him! Yes, yes.</font>

165
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:07,979
<font color="#00ff00">He's, er... He loves cowboys,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">all that stuff.</font>

166
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,419
<font color="#ffff00">We're kind of like sheriffs.</font>

167
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,419
<font color="#ffff00">See?</font>

168
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,699
<font color="#ffff00">And you want to help</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the good guys, right?</font>

169
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,379
<font color="#00ff00">You were asleep, weren't you, bud?</font>

170
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,179
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font> There was a bang outside,
like a gun,

171
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:25,219
so I went onto the balcony.

172
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:30,259
I saw this man. He looked hurt.

173
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,259
He fell back, didn't move again.

174
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,299
<font color="#00ffff">And was anyone else there?</font>

175
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,819
Someone ran away,
but I couldn't see who it was,

176
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:41,699
so I went downstairs
to the reception.

177
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:45,379
I think there's a dead man
on the beach.

178
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,179
<font color="#00ffff">Do we know what time this was?</font>

179
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:51,859
<font color="#ffff00">Darlene checked the security</font>
<font color="#ffff00">camera footage,</font>

180
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,939
<font color="#ffff00">and it was 17 minutes past</font>
<font color="#ffff00">10 when Ollie appeared.</font>

181
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:57,899
<font color="#00ff00">It only takes a couple of minutes</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to get to reception.</font>

182
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:01,659
<font color="#ffff00">That means the shooting must have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">happened about 10:15.</font>

183
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,779
<font color="#00ffff">Miss Reed, can you think of any</font>
<font color="#00ffff">reason as to why someone</font>

184
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:11,059
<font color="#00ffff">would want to do this</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to your fiance?</font>

185
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,899
No.

186
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:16,419
We've only been here for a few days.
We don't know anyone.

187
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:33,339
<font color="#00ff00">Excuse me.</font>

188
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:36,299
<font color="#00ff00">Hi. Um, I didn't want to say</font>
<font color="#00ff00">anything in there,</font>

189
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:40,459
<font color="#00ff00">because it might be nothing,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">but it's about Miss Reed.</font>

190
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:45,819
<font color="#00ff00">Yesterday afternoon I overheard her</font>
<font color="#00ff00">on the phone to her friend.</font>

191
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,699
I don't know what to do, Ali.

192
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,739
Yeah, but I just...I just want it
all to go away.

193
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,339
<font color="#00ff00">She was in a state.</font>

194
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,579
What am I going to do?

195
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:57,099
<font color="#00ff00">Saying she didn't want to be</font>
<font color="#00ff00">with her fiance any more,</font>

196
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:58,779
<font color="#00ff00">but she didn't know how to end it.</font>

197
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:01,899
<font color="#00ff00">I just thought I should mention it.</font>

198
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:03,219
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

199
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,259
PHONE RINGS

200
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,019
<font color="#ffff00">Shall I go speak with her, sir?</font>

201
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:12,899
<font color="#00ffff">Officer Curtis?</font>

202
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:16,299
Commissioner, we've had another
murder called in.

203
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:22,899
Only, the thing is, this one is also
dressed as Santa Claus.

204
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:42,739
Yeah. Yeah, I know I checked out
this morning,

205
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,419
but now I need my room back again.

206
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:47,059
Yeah, well, believe me,

207
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,619
we all get thrown curve balls
from time to time.

208
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:55,099
But, look, listen,
you've got my number, yeah?

209
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,659
Well, just call me or text me
if there's a problem, OK?

210
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,219
OK, thank you. Thank you.

211
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,779
Commissioner Peterson.

212
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:07,139
<font color="#00ffff">Patterson.</font>
Patterson?

213
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,019
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font> Oh. Must have misheard.

214
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,619
The signal round here is well dodgy.

215
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,099
<font color="#00ffff">This is Detective Sergeant</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Naomi Thomas.</font>

216
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:16,299
<font color="#ffff00">Inspector.</font>

217
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,539
There isn't anywhere round here I
can get a takeaway coffee, is there?

218
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:23,019
Actually, you know what?
Forget that. Stupid question.

219
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:26,339
Um, let's go and see this
dead Santa of yours, yeah?

220
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,219
<font color="#00ffff">Right.</font>

221
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,259
Well, this is a first.

222
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:38,819
And the other guy, the other Santa,
he was shot as well?

223
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,659
<font color="#00ffff">Both in the chest.</font>

224
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:43,699
<font color="#ffff00">We've asked the lab to prioritise</font>
<font color="#ffff00">comparing both bullets</font>

225
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,859
<font color="#ffff00">once they've been recovered.</font>

226
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,259
But the likelihood is
the same person shot both of them?

227
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:52,179
<font color="#00ffff">Inspector, Officer Darlene Curtis.</font>

228
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:54,339
<font color="#00ff00">A pleasure to meet you, sir.</font>
And you.

229
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:00,059
<font color="#00ff00">Our second victim's name is</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Tony Hurst.</font>

230
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:03,059
<font color="#00ff00">And get this - he's a songwriter.</font>

231
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:06,019
<font color="#00ff00">He only went and wrote my favourite</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Christmas song ever,</font>

232
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:08,459
<font color="#00ff00">A Christmas Paradise!</font>
Bit of a legend, then.

233
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:11,299
<font color="#00ff00">There's a framed platinum disc</font>
<font color="#00ff00">on the wall.</font>

234
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:22,779
<font color="#00ffff">So, what do you</font>
<font color="#00ffff">make of it, Inspector?</font>

235
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,299
<font color="#00ffff">Inspector?</font>

236
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:26,099
<font color="#00ffff">In... Inspec...?</font>

237
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,339
<font color="#00ffff">Where's he gone?</font>

238
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,179
<font color="#00ffff">Inspector!</font>

239
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:33,179
Gloves.

240
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:40,419
I want to see what gift our Santa
is holding in his hand.

241
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,619
<font color="#00ff00">His hand?</font>

242
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,139
Pen.

243
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,579
Ta.

244
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:53,779
I once chased a Santa Claus
down Oxford Street.

245
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,419
Shoplifting.

246
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:59,419
The department store staff thought
he worked in the grotto,

247
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,779
but he was just some bloke
in a Santa outfit.

248
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:05,699
Talk about hiding in plain sight.

249
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,859
Do you think the killer had
something he wanted us to see?

250
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:19,219
<font color="#00ffff">Please...don't do this.</font>

251
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,539
<font color="#00ffff">I'm begging you.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">You don't have to do this.</font>

252
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:25,419
<font color="#00ffff">Just tell me what it is you want</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and we can sort it out.</font>

253
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,059
GUNSHOT

254
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:31,659
<font color="#ffff00">Sir, look.</font>

255
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:35,459
<font color="#ffff00">10:15 - the same time our first</font>
<font color="#ffff00">victim was shot.</font>

256
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:36,579
For real?

257
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:39,659
<font color="#00ffff">If both murders</font>
<font color="#00ffff">happened at the same time,</font>

258
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,219
<font color="#00ffff">then we're dealing</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with two separate killers.</font>

259
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:46,859
Who seemingly agreed to kill their
victims at the exact same time,

260
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:50,659
in the exact same manner,
wearing the exact same costumes.

261
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:54,899
Interesting.

262
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,819
<font color="#00ffff">I just wanted to say that we</font>
<font color="#00ffff">appreciate you agreeing</font>

263
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,899
<font color="#00ffff">to stay on the island and help us</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with the investigation.</font>

264
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:10,739
<font color="#00ffff">Inspector?</font>

265
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,179
Er, sorry, where are we now?

266
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,699
ROOSTER CROWS

267
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:17,499
<font color="#00ffff">The police station.</font>

268
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:19,779
CHUCKLING
That's a police station?

269
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:24,219
Oh. That is the police station.

270
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,139
Right.

271
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:28,219
<font color="#00ffff">You're used to somewhere bigger?</font>

272
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,859
Well, kind of.

273
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,859
And the team - it's not just the two
of them, is it?

274
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,819
<font color="#00ffff">There is another</font>
<font color="#00ffff">uniform officer, Dwayne,</font>

275
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,219
<font color="#00ffff">but he's taken his</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Christmas holidays early.</font>

276
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,739
Yeah. I'm sure he's earned it.

277
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:43,659
You do still have air con in there,
though, right?

278
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,419
<font color="#00ff00">Excuse me, Commissioner.</font>

279
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,619
<font color="#00ff00">The press are wondering when there's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">going to be a statement made.</font>

280
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:55,179
<font color="#00ff00">There's already been talk of there</font>
<font color="#00ff00">being a Santa serial killer.</font>

281
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:57,859
So who's your media
and comms liaison officer?

282
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:01,979
You don't have one of them either.

283
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:08,979
<font color="#00ffff">Inspector, we are a small island,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with a small team,</font>

284
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:10,699
<font color="#00ffff">with a small budget.</font>

285
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,739
<font color="#00ffff">The sooner you get used to that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">fact, the better.</font>

286
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,459
<font color="#00ffff">Tell them I'll make a statement</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in due course.</font>

287
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:18,939
<font color="#00ff00">OK, sir.</font>

288
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,299
HE SCOFFS

289
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:28,499
<font color="#ffff00">Commissioner.</font>

290
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,259
<font color="#ffff00">I've updated Miss Reed</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on our second murder,</font>

291
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:34,139
<font color="#ffff00">and we're struggling to find</font>
<font color="#ffff00">any link</font>

292
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,219
<font color="#ffff00">between her fiance and Tony Hurst.</font>

293
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,059
<font color="#00ff00">I swear Stu never met this guy.</font>

294
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,419
<font color="#ffff00">We've checked Mr Fullwell's texts,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">call register,</font>

00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:45,419
<font color="#ffff00">emails, checked his bank account.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing.</font>

296
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,259
<font color="#ffff00">The only thing we do have...</font>

297
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,459
<font color="#ffff00">..is this.</font>

298
00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:54,659
<font color="#00ff00">DS Thomas mentioned about what</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Tony Hurst did,</font>

299
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,259
<font color="#00ff00">about how he wrote that song,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">A Christmas Paradise, and...</font>

300
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:00,579
STUART: # A Christmas paradise
in the sun for me and you... #

301
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:02,499
<font color="#ffff00">This was last night at the party.</font>

302
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,259
<font color="#ffff00">But we think it must...it must</font>
<font color="#ffff00">be a coincidence.</font>

303
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:11,379
So what's this I hear about you not
wanting to marry your fiance?

304
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,219
<font color="#00ff00">What? Sorry, who are you?</font>

305
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,299
DI Mervin Wilson. Nice to meet you.

306
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:20,579
So, apparently a witness heard you
saying you wanted to end things

307
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:24,019
with Mr Fullwell but didn't know how
to. That's right, isn't it?

308
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,299
<font color="#00ffff">It is.</font>

309
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,819
So come on, then, what's the deal?

310
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:28,739
<font color="#00ff00">Is he allowed to speak to me</font>
<font color="#00ff00">like that?</font>

311
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,299
<font color="#ffff00">Is it true?</font>

312
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,499
<font color="#00ff00">I just...</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I wanted it so much.</font>

313
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:43,539
<font color="#00ff00">You know, to be married and to have</font>
<font color="#00ff00">kids like everyone else,</font>

314
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:45,259
<font color="#00ff00">but I just do what I always do</font>

315
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,499
<font color="#00ff00">and stayed with someone for</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the wrong reasons and...</font>

316
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:52,299
So you didn't love him,
you just convinced yourself you did?

317
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:55,139
<font color="#00ff00">That's...</font>

318
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:59,059
<font color="#00ff00">That's why I had to call my friend,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">because I didn't know what to do.</font>

319
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:03,339
<font color="#00ff00">You know, calling off the wedding,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that was so huge and...</font>

320
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:07,579
<font color="#00ff00">..disappointing my family, again,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">another relationship down the drain,</font>

321
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,219
<font color="#00ff00">and it just - it all got too much.</font>

322
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,539
And now that's gone away.

323
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:13,859
<font color="#00ff00">What? No.</font>

324
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,699
<font color="#00ff00">No, I didn't. I...</font>

325
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:20,099
<font color="#00ff00">I wouldn't. That is not</font>
<font color="#00ff00">what happened.</font>

326
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:24,259
<font color="#00ffff">Commissioner, Inspector, Sarge,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the lab's just called.</font>

327
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,619
<font color="#00ffff">There's something you might</font>
<font color="#00ffff">want to know.</font>

328
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:36,139
Say that again.

329
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,299
<font color="#00ffff">The bullets recovered from both</font>
<font color="#00ffff">victims' bodies have been compared,</font>

330
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:41,739
<font color="#00ffff">and striation marks indicate...</font>

331
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,299
<font color="#00ffff">..they were fired from the same gun.</font>

332
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,099
<font color="#ffff00">But that can't be.</font>

333
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:48,419
<font color="#ffff00">Both victims were shot</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at the same time.</font>

334
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:52,019
How can the same gun be used in
two separate murders that were

335
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,939
committed at the exact same time
miles apart from each other?

336
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:58,219
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know, but that is</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what the lab is saying.</font>

337
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:29,219
<font color="#00ff00">It's over. Stuart, you stupid idiot.</font>

338
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:39,619
<font color="#ffff00">I feel I ought to say, on behalf of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the rest of the island,</font>

339
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:42,059
<font color="#ffff00">this really isn't one of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">our better hotels.</font>

340
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:49,019
<font color="#ffff00">In fact, I would go as far as to say</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's possibly the worst.</font>

341
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:50,739
Well, let's hope so, eh?

342
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,979
I'm still trying to work out
what this one star is for.

343
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,299
<font color="#ffff00">If you start to tire of its charms,</font>

344
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,939
<font color="#ffff00">there is somewhere we can put you.</font>

345
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:00,019
Good to know.

346
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,059
Anyway...<font color="#ffff00">Ah...</font>

347
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:06,299
<font color="#ffff00">If you don't mind me asking,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">how did you end up here?</font>

348
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:09,939
Oh, it was all a bit last-minute,
really,

349
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:12,299
and this was the only place that
still had a room,

350
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,539
I guess with it being Christmas.

351
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,699
<font color="#ffff00">I meant, um, Saint Marie.</font>

352
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,099
Oh, right.

353
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:22,859
A mate recommended it.

354
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,579
<font color="#ffff00">Ah. I see.</font>

355
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,099
Yeah, no other reason than that,
really.

356
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:29,619
<font color="#ffff00">But you haven't warmed</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to the island?</font>

357
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:33,299
I just wasn't feeling it, you know?

358
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:36,259
I mean, some places you take to
and some you don't, right?

359
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,339
<font color="#ffff00">Oh.</font>

360
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,939
<font color="#ffff00">And that's why you decided</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to leave early?</font>

361
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:42,099
Mm-hm.

00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:51,619

Speaking.

00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:01,059
<font color="#00ffff">Just to say we dropped your car off</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and left the keys with reception.</font>

368
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:04,059

<font color="#00ffff">the last few days, the blue one.</font>

369
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:06,179
OK. Thanks very much. Cheers.

Ah, it really is the season!

378
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:51,739
Old man, come and have
a look at this.

379
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:55,819
Old man!

380
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:57,379
Oh, God, where he gone now?

381
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:06,539
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, morning, Bertrise, Winton.</font>

382
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:10,099
<font color="#ffff00">Hope you'll make it this evening.</font>

<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">You coming to the Christmas fair?</font>

386
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,619
Ah, no, sorry, Catherine.

387
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,899
Me and my father are going out on
the boat and we won't be back

388
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:21,619
till Boxing Day.

389
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,019
<font color="#ffff00">I wondered if the Commissioner might</font>
<font color="#ffff00">have got you working on this</font>

390
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:26,459
<font color="#ffff00">double murder case.</font>

391
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:28,099
Why? What did he say?

392
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:30,579
It was him who signed off on
my holiday, you know.

393
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,979
And as far as I'm concerned
that's legally binding.

394
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:35,139
<font color="#ffff00">I haven't seen Selwyn.</font>

395
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,419
<font color="#ffff00">I just know they're very busy.</font>

396
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,579
Well, I'd made plans to go
fishing with my father,

397
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,579
and that's what we are doing.

398
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:44,099
If I can find him.

399
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:46,779
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, he's over there, talking</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with Tyrus.</font>

400
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:48,019
Tyrus?

401
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,299
That toerag is shadier than
a palm tree at high noon.

'Scuse me, Catherine.

<font color="#00ffff">me throw in a box of crackers.</font>

00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,059
Hey, what's going on here
with you two?

00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:04,179
<font color="#00ff00">You all right, son?</font>

00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:05,339
No.

00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,699
<font color="#00ffff">Officer Myers,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">always a pleasure.</font>

409
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,019
Hmm? Pleasure?

410
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,299
You still owe my Auntie Delilah
a refund for that old

411
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:14,219
broke-down rickety radio
you sold her.

412
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:16,339
She didn't get a peep out of it.

413
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:19,499
<font color="#00ffff">Well, if she has the receipt,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">me be glad to exchange it,</font>

414
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:21,099
<font color="#00ffff">but me na do refunds.</font>

415
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:24,419
You don't do receipts either,
so go figure that.

416
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:26,899
And now you're trying to
fleece my father!

417
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:29,939
<font color="#00ff00">Just some Christmas supplies,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Dwayne.</font>

418
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:32,219
<font color="#00ff00">A couple of bottles of rum,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">some cigars,</font>

419
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:34,059
<font color="#00ff00">so we can enjoy ourselves.</font>

420
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,499
Right.

421
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,299
It's bootleg!

422
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:40,299
<font color="#00ff00">Really?</font>

423
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,139
Now, you give him back his money,

424
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,579
or I'm going to arrest you for
selling counterfeit goods.

425
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:49,859
Your choice.

426
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:57,419
<font color="#00ffff">And a Merry Christmas</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to the both of you.</font>

427
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,139
And a Happy New Year to you!

428
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:01,219
And why are you dressed
like that anyway?

429
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:03,419
Haven't you seen the news?
<font color="#00ffff">What? No.</font>

430
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:05,099
<font color="#00ffff">Me TV don't work. Why?</font>

431
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:07,539
Then try reading a newspaper, then.

432
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:11,699
And you, you didn't even tell me
you were going...<font color="#00ff00">Ah, come on.</font>

433
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:14,059
HE LAUGHS
<font color="#00ff00">I'm all right.</font>

434
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,059
<font color="#00ffff">Yo, Anton?</font>

435
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,779
<font color="#00ffff">Let me see that for a second.</font>

436
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,099
<font color="#ffff00">I tell you, the island is really</font>
<font color="#ffff00">shaken up by these murders,</font>

437
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:33,339
<font color="#ffff00">and I have a list as long as</font>
<font color="#ffff00">my arm of people thinking that</font>

438
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:35,539
<font color="#ffff00">they know who the murderer is.</font>

439
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,619
<font color="#ffff00">I wouldn't be surprised if Santa</font>
<font color="#ffff00">himself doesn't make</font>

440
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,099
<font color="#ffff00">an appearance at some point.</font>

441
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:45,659
<font color="#00ff00">You're in early, sir.</font>

442
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:49,179
We've got another one.

443
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,459
<font color="#00ffff">I was heading home after work.</font>

444
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:04,139
That was the night before last,
when the other shootings happened.

445
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:06,499
<font color="#00ffff">No problem. Me have it all lined up.</font>

446
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,739
<font color="#00ffff">I just need this sorting</font>
<font color="#00ffff">before Christmas.</font>

447
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,579
Tell her what time it was.

448
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:12,739
<font color="#00ffff">10:15.</font>

449
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,259
<font color="#00ffff">I remember noticing.</font>

450
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:19,659
<font color="#00ff00">Hmm. And, ah, any reason why you</font>
<font color="#00ff00">were - are - dressed...</font>

451
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,299
<font color="#00ff00">..like this?</font>

452
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:25,659
<font color="#00ffff">Me own a stall down the harbour.</font>

453
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:29,619
<font color="#00ffff">Always like to spruce myself up</font>
<font color="#00ffff">this time of year,</font>

455
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:34,099
<font color="#00ffff">Too much gloom now in the world,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">right?</font>

456
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:37,939
<font color="#00ff00">So what exactly happened?</font>

457
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:40,459
<font color="#00ffff">Heard some movement over there.</font>

458
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:43,459
<font color="#00ffff">Somebody there?</font>

459
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:44,779
<font color="#00ffff">Then...</font>

460
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:47,539
<font color="#00ffff">Bang! First shot missed me.</font>

461
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,779
<font color="#00ffff">Second one clipped me.</font>
GUNSHOTS

462
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:53,379
<font color="#00ffff">Managed to get out</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the way before the third.</font>

463
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:54,979
And then what?

464
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,459
<font color="#00ffff">A car came round the bend.</font>

465
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:00,339
<font color="#00ffff">Reckon it spooked whoever</font>
<font color="#00ffff">was shooting at me.</font>

466
00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:02,059
<font color="#00ffff">I saw them running off.</font>

467
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:05,819
OK, Tyrus.

468
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,299
It's been two days, man.

469
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:10,659
Why are you only reporting this now?

470
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:13,499
And don't go thinking
you can fob me off.

471
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,859
I'm not as easy-going as this lot.

472
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:19,779
You see, in my experience,
people tend not to keep quiet

473
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,539
about being shot - unless they've
got something to hide themselves.

474
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:26,939
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I might owe a likkle money,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">if you get me.</font>

475
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,019
<font color="#00ffff">So at first I thought it was someone</font>
<font color="#00ffff">giving me a scare,</font>

476
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,579
<font color="#00ffff">a warning, you know?</font>

477
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,979
<font color="#00ffff">But then I read about</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the other shootings.</font>

478
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,299
<font color="#ffff00">Inspector!</font>

479
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:37,059
<font color="#ffff00">I've located one of the bullets.</font>

480
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:40,019
<font color="#ffff00">I'll get it down to the lab</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and then I'll keep looking.</font>

481
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:43,659
<font color="#00ffff">But what if whoever did this,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what if they're still out there?</font>

482
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:46,379
<font color="#00ffff">What if they want to finish off</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what they started?</font>

483
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:48,059
<font color="#00ffff">Is my life still in danger?</font>

484
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:51,619
HE CLEARS THROAT

485
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:05,939
He's right.

486
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:11,459
I mean, how can we know for certain
they won't come back and try again?

487
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:13,059
He's going to need protection.

488
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:16,779
<font color="#ffff00">But how are we expected</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to do that, sir?</font>

489
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:18,619
<font color="#ffff00">We're spread thin enough as it is.</font>

{\an8}MUSIC: Flying Home
by Tommy McCook

491
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:30,299
So, old man, what you reckon?

492
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:33,019
Some fishing and then a beer,

493
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,659
or a beer and then some fishing?

494
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:38,619
<font color="#00ffff">Definitely the second option.</font>

495
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:40,059
Yes I!

496
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:41,739
Hey.

497

Ah!

00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:47,019
So...

499

Oh, no.

Ah!

512

Are you serious? I have to spend
Christmas in a safehouse?!

And what about my father's life?

519
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:40,019
We're supposed to be spending
Christmas together.

520
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:41,979
I've got it all planned.

521

00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:57,779
Ah, you know what?
As quaint as that looks,

546
00:30:57,819 --> 00:30:59,779
I'll just stay here and, ah...

547
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:09,699
<font color="#ffff00">Commissioner?</font>

548
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:12,259
<font color="#ffff00">I called Darlene.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">She's on her way down.</font>

549
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:13,859
And the Inspector?

550
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:15,979
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, he's...</font>

551
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:18,859
<font color="#ffff00">..building up to it.</font>

552
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:23,059
<font color="#00ffff">Commissioner.</font>

553
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:25,859
<font color="#00ffff">It's Brianna Clemetson.</font>

554
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:28,419
<font color="#00ffff">You probably don't remember me,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but we've crossed paths at church</font>

555
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,739
<font color="#00ffff">a couple of times.</font>

556
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:31,059
<font color="#00ff00">Yes, of course.</font>

557
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,059
<font color="#00ffff">I wondered if you had a moment?</font>

558
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:38,259
<font color="#00ffff">I spoke with one of your officers</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about the two murders last night,</font>

559
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,179
<font color="#00ffff">but I know how busy you all are.</font>

560
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:45,499
<font color="#00ffff">There's someone I think you need to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">be considering as a suspect.</font>

561
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,539
<font color="#00ff00">Let's go and find somewhere</font>
<font color="#00ff00">quiet to talk.</font>

562
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:59,019
Imagine that.

563
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:01,659
Of all the people I get to spend
Christmas with,

564
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:04,299
Tyrus 'The Tealeaf' DeMille!

565
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,979
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, you think I'm thrilled</font>
<font color="#00ffff">about this?</font>

566
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:09,259
<font color="#00ffff">Take a look at the sleeping</font>
<font color="#00ffff">arrangements.</font>

567
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,659
So where you sleeping?

568
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,459
<font color="#00ffff">In the bed.</font>

569
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:17,499
I think we should take
turns on the sofa.

570
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:18,699
<font color="#00ffff">What sofa?</font>

571
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:28,619
There's no way on earth I'm sharing
that tiny thing with you.

572
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:33,619
<font color="#ffff00">Dwayne, I know it's not</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the Christmas you wanted,</font>

573
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:37,339
<font color="#ffff00">but, seriously, you need to stop</font>
<font color="#ffff00">being such a baby about it.</font>

574
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:41,979
<font color="#00ffff">He's obviously used to a more</font>
<font color="#00ffff">cosmopolitan environment than here.</font>

575
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:46,699
<font color="#ffff00">Is that DI fancy-pants</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you're talking about?</font>

576
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:50,699
<font color="#00ff00">Naomi was just saying he can be</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a little frank in his opinions.</font>

577
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:51,779
<font color="#ffff00">Hmm!</font>

578
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:54,259
<font color="#ffff00">Plain rude is what he is.</font>

579
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,299
<font color="#ffff00">Honestly, he makes another comment</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about how nothing out here</font>

580
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:02,539
<font color="#ffff00">works properly, I swear I'm going</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to get the pepper spray out.</font>

581
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:03,819
<font color="#ffff00">Serious!</font>

582
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,659
<font color="#00ffff">I just keep telling myself,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">"It's just one case,</font>

583
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:08,819
<font color="#00ffff">"and then he'll be gone." Yeah?</font>

584
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:10,339
OK, thank you.

585
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:13,819
<font color="#00ffff">Inspector, let me introduce you</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to Catherine.</font>

586
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,459
<font color="#00ffff">She's our town mayor and owns</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the best bar on the island.</font>

587
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:20,499
All right?<font color="#00ff00">It's so nice to meet...</font>
That was the lab on the phone.

588
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,019
The third bullet is
a match for the other two,

589
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:26,379
which means for definite all three
victims were shot by the same gun,

590
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:29,099
at the same time, in three
separate locations.

591
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,419
So riddle me that, DS Thomas.

592
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:32,819
<font color="#00ff00">Excuse me.</font>

593
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:34,539
<font color="#00ff00">I'm a host this evening.</font>

594
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:38,059
<font color="#00ff00">A pleasure meeting you, Mervin.</font>

595
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:44,219
<font color="#00ff00">Thank you to the</font>

596
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:47,899
<font color="#00ff00">and now a very special treat</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for us all -</font>

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

599
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:57,419
# O holy night

600
00:33:57,459 --> 00:34:01,739
# The stars are brightly shining

601
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:04,339
# It is the night... #
<font color="#ffff00">Hush now.</font>

602
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:06,899
# Of the dear Saviour's birth... #

603
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,059
<font color="#00ff00">And this man who has been parking</font>
<font color="#00ff00">on your street...</font>

604
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:14,619
<font color="#00ffff">Lurking.</font>

605
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,659
<font color="#00ff00">..why do you think he's a possible</font>
<font color="#00ff00">suspect for the recent murders?</font>

606
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:22,219
<font color="#00ffff">Because of the house</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he's parked outside.</font>

607
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:24,539
<font color="#00ffff">Old Mr Blanchard lives there,</font>

608
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:28,019
<font color="#00ffff">and he works as a Father Christmas</font>
<font color="#00ffff">for the grotto</font>

609
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:30,259
<font color="#00ffff">at the supermarket up</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in Port Royal.</font> <font color="#00ff00">Mm.</font>

610
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:35,939
<font color="#00ff00">Can you give me a description of</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the man you've seen on your road?</font>

611
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:37,179
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, he's...</font>

612
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,939
<font color="#00ffff">He's right there.</font>

613
00:34:44,979 --> 00:34:47,099
<font color="#00ff00">Ah, sorry...</font> <font color="#00ffff">That's him.</font>

614
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:50,059
<font color="#00ffff">That man over there</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in the green hat,</font>

615
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,099
<font color="#00ffff">he's the one who has been</font>
<font color="#00ffff">committing these murders.</font> <font color="#00ff00">I-I...</font>

616
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,979
<font color="#00ff00">I promise...</font>
PEOPLE MURMUR

617
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:58,979
INDISTINCT CHATTER

618
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:03,579
What's going on?

619
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:08,219
<font color="#00ffff">I think they're saying that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you're the killer, sir.</font>

620
00:35:08,259 --> 00:35:10,019
<font color="#00ff00">Believe me, believe me...</font>

621
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:30,579
This is crazy.

622
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:32,859
You don't actually believe her,
do you?

623
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:34,379
<font color="#00ff00">Of course not.</font>

624
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:37,259
<font color="#00ff00">But I do need to know why you were</font>
<font color="#00ff00">hanging around this street.</font>

625
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:40,259
<font color="#00ff00">Unless you deny it.</font>

626
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:42,179
Look, it's not illegal, is it?

627
00:35:42,219 --> 00:35:44,859
I mean, I'm not actually breaking
any laws, so...

628
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:46,979
So what's the big deal?

629
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,939
<font color="#00ff00">This is a small island, Inspector.</font>

630
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:51,699
<font color="#00ff00">People talk.</font>

631
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:55,979
<font color="#00ff00">And the last thing I need is them</font>
<font color="#00ff00">talking about you as a suspect</font>

632
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:57,699
<font color="#00ff00">in our murder case.</font>

633
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,499
This is ridiculous, all right?

634
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:03,979
I mean, it's nobody's business
what I was doing here -

635
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,059
including yours, with respect.

636
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,019
So if you don't mind...<font color="#00ff00">Inspector.</font>

637
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,539
<font color="#00ff00">And with equal respect,</font>

638
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:18,859
<font color="#00ff00">I'm afraid to say it is my business,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">as your senior officer,</font>

639
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:22,099
<font color="#00ff00">heading up an investigation</font>
<font color="#00ff00">in which your name</font>

640
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,259
<font color="#00ff00">has come under the spotlight.</font>

641
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:28,299
<font color="#00ff00">I have every right to insist</font>
<font color="#00ff00">you explain yourself.</font>

642
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:34,019
<font color="#00ff00">Inspector...</font>

643
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:39,019
<font color="#00ff00">..please.</font>

644
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:40,459
<font color="#00ff00">Tell me.</font>

645
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:47,459
All right. Erm...

646
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:52,099
I, erm...

647
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:55,219
I think...

648
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:58,739
I think that's my mother's house.

649
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:02,899
<font color="#00ff00">Sorry?</font>

650
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:06,259
My mum lives there, I think.

651
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:07,819
<font color="#00ff00">You think?</font>

652
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,339
Well, I mean...

653
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:11,059
I'm sure she does,

654
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:14,339
but without actually knocking
on the door and asking,

655
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:15,899
I can't be 100%.

656
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:20,259
I've never met her.

657
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:24,339
Yet.

658
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:29,979
Ever.

659
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:32,939
<font color="#00ff00">So...</font>

660
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,059
<font color="#00ff00">..that's why you came out here.</font>

661
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,819
And that's why I was about
to fly home,

662
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,099
because I realised it was all
a big mistake coming here, yeah?

663
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:47,979
And then my boss called
and "asked me" to stick around

664
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:49,739
and help with your investigation.

665
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:54,659
Look, I'm sorry, yeah?

666
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:57,539
I'm sorry if I scared that woman,

667
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:01,819
{\an8}but right now I'd rather put
this behind us so I can get on

668
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,539
{\an8}with the job of catching
your killer,

669
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:06,339
and then I can get the hell
out of here.

670
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:13,979
I'm going to walk back to
the hotel, yeah?

671
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:15,379
Thank you.

<font color="#00ff00">Morning, Mrs Hammond.</font>

680
00:39:10,419 --> 00:39:12,659
<font color="#ffff00">Hi. Just to let you know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'll be checking out</font>

681
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:14,499
<font color="#ffff00">this morning unexpectedly.</font> I see.

682
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:16,259
<font color="#ffff00">I've got to fly back</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to the UK today.</font>

683
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:18,139
OK, madam.<font color="#ffff00">Work reasons.</font>

684
00:39:24,979 --> 00:39:26,379
<font color="#00ffff">Morning, Inspector.</font>

685
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:29,579
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, wow.</font>

686
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:30,739
<font color="#00ffff">That's a...</font>

687
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,099
<font color="#00ffff">..big breakfast you've got there.</font>

688
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:40,699
<font color="#00ffff">So that was, ah, funny,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">yesterday evening.</font>

689
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:43,819
<font color="#00ffff">Everyone thinking you were</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the killer.</font>

690
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,179
Funny?

691
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:49,139
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I mean, not funny ha-ha</font>
<font color="#00ffff">exactly, but, um...</font>

692
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,259
<font color="#00ffff">..funny.</font>

693
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:53,859
<font color="#00ffff">Unexpected.</font>

694
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:55,099
Right.

695
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:57,619
<font color="#00ffff">The Commissioner said that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">there had been some mix-up</font>

696
00:39:57,659 --> 00:39:59,979
<font color="#00ffff">but it's all sorted now?</font>

697
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:01,379
Pretty much.

698
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:03,539
<font color="#00ffff">Strange, though, isn't it,</font>

699
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:05,939
<font color="#00ffff">why she thought you were the killer?</font>

700
00:40:05,979 --> 00:40:08,779
So, look, a new lead has come in.

701
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:11,579
A publisher in the UK has been
in contact.

702
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:14,419
Apparently Tony Hurst was
writing his memoir.

703
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:16,739
They asked us to email over
the latest draft,

704
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:18,419
said it was saved on his laptop.

705
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:22,339
Only, when I checked the crime scene
log Officer Curtis made,

706
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,579
there's no laptop on it.

707
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:25,979
See?

708
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:28,019
<font color="#00ffff">You think his laptop was stolen?</font>

709
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,779
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, we're leaving?</font>

710
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:33,419
<font color="#00ffff">But you haven't even finished</font>
<font color="#00ffff">your breakfast. Sir...</font>

711
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,139
SHE SIGHS
<font color="#00ffff">Off we go again.</font>

712
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:41,579
So I went back to Tony Hurst's
villa, dusted the desktop

713
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,899
and surrounding area
for fingerprints.

714
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:45,499
<font color="#00ffff">And did you find anything?</font>

715
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:49,019
Karla Hammond, shoplifting charge
back in the UK in her teens.

716
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:50,539
<font color="#00ffff">And who's she?</font>

717
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,059
She's a successful businesswoman,
runs an online luxury

718
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:56,939
design company, but it's who
she was that's of more interest.

719
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:59,579
40 years ago,
under a different name,

720
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:02,739
Karla Hammond recorded
A Christmas Paradise.

721
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:04,059
<font color="#00ffff">She sang that?</font>

722
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:06,979
Mm-hm, and a few days ago
she arrived on this island.

723
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:20,459
Karla Hammond?

724
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:22,139
DI Wilson, DS Thomas.

725
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,259
We'd like to have a little chat.

726
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:26,619
<font color="#00ffff">And we'd also like to take</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a look into those suitcases.</font>

727
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:32,699
<font color="#00ffff">Well...</font>

728
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:36,059
<font color="#00ffff">..it's definitely his.</font>

729
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:41,219
<font color="#00ffff">So at the very least</font>
<font color="#00ffff">we're looking at theft.</font>

730
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:43,219
<font color="#00ffff">Do you want to tell us what</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you're doing in possession of</font>

731
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:46,659
<font color="#00ffff">Tony Hurst's laptop, Miss Hammond?</font>

732
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:51,099
Karla, we know about the memoir
Mr Hurst was writing,

733
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:54,139
which I'm assuming you must get
a mention or two in.

734
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:00,659
You look very different these days.

735
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:05,019
I mean, to how you looked
when the song came out.

736
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,699
Unrecognisable.

737
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:08,539
<font color="#ffff00">It was 40 years ago, Inspector.</font>

738
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:10,499
Yeah, yeah, I know that,
but it's more than that.

739
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:12,099
It's more than just age.

740
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:16,259
I looked at the website
for your business.

741
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:17,339
Impressive.

742
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:20,699
But there isn't one mention of
who you used to be, you know,

743
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,619
your past celebrity.

744
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:26,139
In fact, I'd go as far as to say
you tried very hard to pretend

745
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:28,099
it never happened.

746
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:30,699
Which makes me wonder if
there's something in that memoir

747
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:32,059
you didn't want coming out.

748
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,499
And what might that be, exactly?

749
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:43,099
<font color="#ffff00">That it wasn't me that sang</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the vocal on A Christmas Paradise,</font>

750
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:46,139
<font color="#ffff00">that a session singer</font>
<font color="#ffff00">recorded the song</font>

751
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:49,219
<font color="#ffff00">and I was just the pretty face</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that mimed along.</font>

752
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:53,019
And by that look on your face,

753
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:55,179
I'm guessing he wasn't
making that up.

754
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:01,779
<font color="#ffff00">I was a model back in 1984,</font>

755
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:05,099
<font color="#ffff00">and the real singer, they paid</font>
<font color="#ffff00">her off because she didn't have</font>

756
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:09,659
<font color="#ffff00">the looks - Tony's words, not mine -</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and I was offered</font>

757
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:11,779
<font color="#ffff00">the opportunity instead.</font>

758
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:13,619
<font color="#00ffff">So why reveal it now?</font>

759
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:16,899
<font color="#ffff00">Well, despite appearances,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Tony was in need of money.</font>

760
00:43:16,939 --> 00:43:19,539
<font color="#ffff00">His royalties didn't bring in</font>
<font color="#ffff00">what they used to,</font>

761
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:23,139
<font color="#ffff00">so he did a deal on his memoir.</font>

762
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:26,539
<font color="#ffff00">The publishers wanted all</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the juicy secrets.</font>

763
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,779
<font color="#00ffff">So you flew out here to convince him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">not to go through with it?</font>

764
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,499
<font color="#00ff00">There's nothing I can do about it.</font>

765
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:34,499
<font color="#00ff00">The publishers have got it.</font>

766
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:37,419
<font color="#ffff00">Please, Tony, I'm begging you.</font>

767
00:43:38,779 --> 00:43:40,219
<font color="#ffff00">And you're right.</font>

768
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:43,059
<font color="#ffff00">The last thing I need is to be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">thrust into the spotlight after all</font>

769
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:47,539
<font color="#ffff00">these years, press at my door,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">photo in the news,</font>

770
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,379
<font color="#ffff00">outing me as a liar.</font>

771
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,899
<font color="#ffff00">I don't need to be made a fool of,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Inspector.</font>

772
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:54,939
<font color="#ffff00">"The ditsy model who mimed along</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to a pop song."</font>

773
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,619
<font color="#ffff00">Well, obviously</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not her any more.</font>

774
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:02,179
So how did you get hold of
his laptop, then?

775
00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:07,659
<font color="#ffff00">That night, I admit,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I went to see Tony again.</font>

776
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:11,259
<font color="#ffff00">Tony, I am not going to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">take no for an...</font>

777
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:14,939
<font color="#ffff00">But when I got to his villa,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he was already dead.</font>

778
00:44:14,979 --> 00:44:20,099
<font color="#ffff00">And I realised nobody else knew</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I was here on the island,</font>

779
00:44:20,139 --> 00:44:24,779
<font color="#ffff00">and if I took the only</font>
<font color="#ffff00">copy of the memoir</font>

780
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:27,339
<font color="#ffff00">no-one would ever know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">where it went.</font>

781
00:44:27,379 --> 00:44:29,259
And your secret would be safe.

782
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:38,139
<font color="#00ffff">Darlene, we're emailing over</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a copy of Tony Hurst's memoir.</font>

783
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:41,579
<font color="#00ffff">We need you to tell us exactly</font>
<font color="#00ffff">what it says about Karla Hammond.</font>

784
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:43,459
<font color="#ffff00">Doing it right now, honey.</font>

PHONE VIBRATES

SHE SIGHS
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, what does he want now?</font>

788
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:55,099
<font color="#ffff00">Dwayne, is everything all right?</font>

789
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:56,739
Yes, Darlene.

790
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:59,219
I'm just having some tinned soup.

791
00:45:00,419 --> 00:45:02,619
And you called me to tell me that?

792
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:06,339
Honestly, honey, I am in the middle
of a murder investigation here.

793
00:45:06,379 --> 00:45:09,619
<font color="#ffff00">OK, look,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I was asking after my father.</font>

795
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:14,819
He's at my auntie's right now.

796
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:17,139
But why don't you just give him
a call?

797
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:19,099
I'm sure he's missing you.

798
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,219
<font color="#ffff00">Is everything OK?</font>

00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:42,019
<font color="#00ffff">I guess you could call it</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a kind of party, I mean,</font>

806
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:44,219
<font color="#00ffff">not a big one.</font>

00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:08,859
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, you legend.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">on here? Who's that?</font>

820
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:17,779
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, just a friend of mine.</font>

821
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:20,099
<font color="#00ff00">He getting me</font>
<font color="#00ff00">some last-minute Christmas shopping.</font>

822
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:22,259
<font color="#00ff00">A few presents me ask him</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to pick up.</font>

823
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:24,779
<font color="#ffff00">And how did he know you was here?</font>

824
00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:27,139
<font color="#00ff00">Well, I might have</font>
<font color="#00ff00">used your phone for calling</font>

825
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:28,739
<font color="#00ff00">when you weren't looking.</font>

826
00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:30,099
<font color="#ffff00">And compromise your own safety?</font>

827
00:46:30,139 --> 00:46:31,499
<font color="#00ff00">Marcel's cool, man.</font>

828
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,779
<font color="#00ff00">He na tell.</font>

829
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,179
<font color="#ffff00">Who are these presents for?</font>

830
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:36,499
<font color="#00ff00">No-one.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Just gifts.</font>

831
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:39,499
<font color="#ffff00">Show me.</font> <font color="#00ff00">No, it's personal.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Tyrus!</font>

832
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:45,299
BARKS

833
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:47,139
<font color="#ffff00">What kind of Christmas</font>
<font color="#ffff00">present is that?</font>

834
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,859
<font color="#00ff00">It's for me daughter.</font>

835
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:50,699
<font color="#00ff00">She really wanted a puppy.</font>

836
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,499
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't know you had a daughter.</font>

837
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:54,619
<font color="#00ff00">Well, now you do.</font>

838
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:56,779
<font color="#ffff00">So how was you going to get them</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to her</font>

839
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:59,939
<font color="#ffff00">if you're stuck out here with me,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">hmm?</font>

840
00:46:59,979 --> 00:47:02,459
<font color="#ffff00">You were going to make a break for</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it, wasn't you?</font>

841
00:47:02,499 --> 00:47:04,339
<font color="#ffff00">Now I'm going to have to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">confiscate the puppy.</font>

842
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:05,859
<font color="#00ff00">No way, man!</font>

843
00:47:05,899 --> 00:47:07,979
<font color="#ffff00">Tyrus, I'm here to protect you,</font>

844
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:10,619
<font color="#ffff00">and I can't do that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">if you go off gallivanting.</font>

845
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,539
QUIET CRYING

846
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:29,539
<font color="#ffff00">Now I've got to look after</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the both of you, huh?</font>

847
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:35,619
So, what have we got?

848
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:39,539
We've got three victims in Santa
Claus outfits, all of whom were

849
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:47,139
shot with the same gun, at the same
time, in three different locations.

850
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,099
Stuart Fullwell was at his hotel.

851
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:51,139
GUNSHOT

852
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:55,859
Tony Hurst was at his villa.

853
00:47:55,899 --> 00:47:57,379
<font color="#ffff00">Don't do this.</font>

854
00:47:57,419 --> 00:47:59,499
GUNSHOT

855
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:01,459
And Tyrus Demille was walking home.

856
00:48:01,499 --> 00:48:03,579
GUNSHOT

857
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:06,179
So, questions... How?

858
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:09,899
How did our killer manage to fire
the same gun in three

859
00:48:09,939 --> 00:48:13,619
different locations at the exact
same time?

860
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:16,019
And what does our killer
have against people

861
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,299
dressed as Santa Claus?

862
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,699
<font color="#ffff00">I have another question.</font>

863
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:29,699
<font color="#ffff00">Um... Why are we here?</font>

864
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:32,579
<font color="#ffff00">And I don't mean in a</font>
<font color="#ffff00">"what's the meaning of life?"</font>

865
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:38,899
<font color="#ffff00">kind of way, just,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">why are we here, in the market,</font>

866
00:48:38,939 --> 00:48:41,059
<font color="#ffff00">and not at the police station?</font>

867
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,059
<font color="#ffff00">That's usually where we do</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this kind of thing.</font>

868
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:44,459
Ah, yeah, right.

869
00:48:44,499 --> 00:48:46,219
Um, I just prefer it here.

870
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,939
<font color="#ffff00">Right.</font>

871
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:51,379
Yeah, reminds me
a bit of being back in London.

872
00:48:51,419 --> 00:48:55,739
I find it easier to think
when there's busyness, you know,

873
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:58,299
people about, bustle, noise.

874
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:01,299
<font color="#ffff00">You're missing it there?</font>

875
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:04,539
I'm looking forward to getting back,
put it that way.

876
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:09,219
<font color="#ffff00">So what's a Mervin Wilson Christmas</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like back in London?</font>

877
00:49:09,259 --> 00:49:11,099
Nothing special, really.

878
00:49:11,139 --> 00:49:12,259
Quiet.

879
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:15,859
<font color="#ffff00">Thought you didn't like quiet.</font>

880
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:20,739
I work...over Christmas, usually.

881
00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:22,819
I take the Christmas Day shift.

882
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,019
<font color="#ffff00">How come?</font>

883
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:28,619
I live alone. So...

884
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:33,299
..yeah. What about you?

885
00:49:33,339 --> 00:49:37,379
What does
a DS Thomas Christmas look like?

886
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:40,699
<font color="#ffff00">Well, if I can, I go back to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">St Barnabas.</font>

887
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:42,179
<font color="#ffff00">That's where I grew up.</font>

888
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:46,019
<font color="#ffff00">Spend it with my family,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">my uncle's family, um...</font>

889
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:48,539
<font color="#ffff00">..nothing special, you know.</font>

890
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:50,779
<font color="#ffff00">We spend the day cooking, talking.</font>

891
00:49:52,459 --> 00:49:55,099
<font color="#ffff00">That's what Christmas is about.</font>

892
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:57,619
<font color="#ffff00">Spending time with the people</font>
<font color="#ffff00">who love you.</font>

893
00:49:57,659 --> 00:49:59,459
<font color="#ffff00">Right?</font>

894
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:02,419
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

895
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:19,419
<font color="#ffff00">So, what's he called, then?</font>

896
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:21,139
<font color="#00ff00">Huh?</font> <font color="#ffff00">Your puppy.</font>

897
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:25,699
<font color="#00ff00">Er...Tyrus.</font>

898
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:30,059
<font color="#ffff00">You named him after a fool?!</font>

899
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:39,179
<font color="#00ff00">It's so she remembers me. Jasmine.</font>

900
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:44,779
<font color="#00ff00">Me and her mother aren't together</font>
<font color="#00ff00">any more, so she na see me as much.</font>

901
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,219
<font color="#00ff00">That's why I got her all</font>
<font color="#00ff00">those presents.</font>

902
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,659
<font color="#00ff00">I just really wanted to make it</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a special day, you know?</font>

903
00:50:56,539 --> 00:50:58,779
<font color="#ffff00">I'd made plans like that, myself.</font>

904
00:51:00,419 --> 00:51:04,099
<font color="#ffff00">Me and my father,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">just the two of us.</font>

905
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:05,379
<font color="#ffff00">Huh..</font>

906
00:51:05,419 --> 00:51:10,819
<font color="#00ff00">Well, I guess we're both missing out</font>
<font color="#00ff00">this Christmas, stuck in here.</font>

907
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:54,539
<font color="#ffff00">Everything all right?</font>

908
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:58,899
<font color="#ffff00">Commissioner Patterson said you know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">someone on this street.</font>

909
00:52:00,779 --> 00:52:03,739
<font color="#ffff00">It's not Dorna, is it?</font>

910
00:52:03,779 --> 00:52:05,619
Dorna Bray, yeah.

911
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:08,099
You know her?
I just came to visit her.

912
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:12,219
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, but Dorna passed away.</font>

913
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:15,739
<font color="#ffff00">A few months back, it was.</font>

914
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:21,819
<font color="#ffff00">Are you a friend of hers?</font>

915
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:27,299
Um...
no, not-not really.

916
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:32,339
Thanks, anyway.

917
00:52:32,379 --> 00:52:33,779
Sorry to disturb you.

918
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,579
<font color="#ffff00">Excuse me, I'll come back.</font>

919
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:03,859
<font color="#ffff00">I have to take this.</font>

920
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:09,659
<font color="#ffff00">Miss Clemetson,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is everything all right?</font>

921
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:18,299
PHONE BUZZES

922
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:24,379
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, how's the party going?</font>

923
00:53:24,419 --> 00:53:26,979
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, it's all right, you know.</font>

924
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:28,419
<font color="#00ffff">Everyone is enjoying themselves.</font>

925
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:29,899
<font color="#ffff00">Are you OK?</font>

926
00:53:29,939 --> 00:53:31,899
<font color="#ffff00">Don't forget,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">if you're not feeling well,</font>

927
00:53:31,939 --> 00:53:33,379
<font color="#ffff00">take one of your tablets, you know.</font>

928
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:34,659
<font color="#00ffff">No, I'm all right.</font>

929
00:53:34,699 --> 00:53:38,859
<font color="#00ffff">It's just, it's not the same, is it?</font>

930
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:40,579
<font color="#00ffff">It's someone else's family.</font>

931
00:53:41,779 --> 00:53:43,579
<font color="#00ffff">At Christmas, anyway.</font>

932
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:45,819
<font color="#ffff00">Tell me about it.</font>

933
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:48,019
<font color="#ffff00">I know it wasn't what we planned,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you know.</font>

934
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:51,459
<font color="#ffff00">But hey...maybe next year, huh?</font>

935
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:54,619
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. Maybe next year.</font>

936
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:08,859
KNOCK ON DOOR

937
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:14,499
Commissioner.

938
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:15,859
<font color="#ffff00">May I come in?</font>

939
00:54:15,899 --> 00:54:17,499
Yeah, sure.

940
00:54:22,499 --> 00:54:25,339
Excuse the, er, mess.

941
00:54:25,379 --> 00:54:30,339
<font color="#ffff00">I think it's actually worse</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on the inside than the outside.</font>

942
00:54:30,379 --> 00:54:33,259
Yeah.
Quite an achievement, right?

943
00:54:33,299 --> 00:54:38,059
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't realise your mother</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was Dorna Bray.</font>

944
00:54:40,419 --> 00:54:42,379
<font color="#ffff00">I-I didn't know her well, but...</font>

945
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:46,019
<font color="#ffff00">..I'm so sorry.</font>

946
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:47,499
Ah, don't worry about it.

947
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:49,019
It's all good.

948
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:50,979
I'm fine.

949
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:52,939

I mean, I didn't actually know her,
did I?

00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:58,019

What's your name, then?

DARLENE SINGS ALONG

996
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:31,139
<font color="#ffff00">So I've been speaking with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Tony Hurst's record company,</font>

997
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:34,579
<font color="#ffff00">and Kenny Simmons sampled the chorus</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from A Christmas Paradise</font>

998
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:37,939
<font color="#ffff00">and used it in a track</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he released on social media.</font>

999
00:59:37,979 --> 00:59:40,419
<font color="#ffff00">Six million likes.</font>

1000
00:59:40,459 --> 00:59:42,539
<font color="#ffff00">It was going to be a big</font>
<font color="#ffff00">hit for Kenny.</font>

1001
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,779
Going to be?

1002
00:59:43,819 --> 00:59:46,579
<font color="#ffff00">Well, Kenny initially released</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the track without ever seeking</font>

1003
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:48,539
<font color="#ffff00">Tony Hurst's permission to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">use the sample.</font>

1004
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:51,059
<font color="#ffff00">When the song started getting</font>
<font color="#ffff00">some attention,</font>

1005
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:52,979
<font color="#ffff00">the record company became aware.</font>

1006
00:59:53,019 --> 00:59:55,499
And Tony Hurst refused to grant it,
right?

1007
00:59:55,539 --> 00:59:58,979
<font color="#ffff00">Unless it was for the right fee,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">which Kenny couldn't afford.</font>

1008
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:00,619
And now Tony Hurst is dead.

1009
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:02,699
<font color="#ffff00">According to Kenny's lawyers,</font>

1010
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:06,059
<font color="#ffff00">the record company are keen to get</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the process moving again.</font>

1011
01:00:06,099 --> 01:00:08,739
I'll bet they are.

1012
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:13,379
<font color="#00ff00">Do we really have to do this now?</font>

1013
01:00:13,419 --> 01:00:15,099
<font color="#00ff00">It's Christmas Day.</font>

1014
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:17,659
<font color="#00ff00">There's children in there</font>
<font color="#00ff00">waiting for their presents.</font>

1015
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:20,139
And how thrilled will their parents
be if they find out

1016
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:22,979
the police let an unknown killer
play Santa's little helper?

1017
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,419
<font color="#00ff00">I didn't kill anyone.</font>

1018
01:00:24,459 --> 01:00:26,979
But you have benefited from
Tony Hurst's death, haven't you?

1019
01:00:28,979 --> 01:00:30,539
<font color="#ffff00">Your song.</font>

1020
01:00:30,579 --> 01:00:32,979
<font color="#ffff00">Tony Hurst ruined any</font>
<font color="#ffff00">chance of it being released.</font>

1021
01:00:33,019 --> 01:00:35,099
But that's all changed now,
hasn't it?

1022
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:36,619
Now he's no longer with us.

1023
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:38,499
<font color="#00ff00">Well, nothing's been signed,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">all right?</font>

1024
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:40,219
<font color="#00ff00">These things are complicated.</font>

1025
01:00:40,259 --> 01:00:41,659
Well, not in your case, they're not.

1026
01:00:41,699 --> 01:00:44,339
You see,
we've spoken to the record company,

1027
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:47,099
and we know they're keen,
and you're definitely keen.

1028
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:48,939
So let's skip the modesty, yeah?

1029
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,179
Cos you're about to become
seriously minted, right?

1030
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:56,299
<font color="#00ff00">I could do all right for myself.</font>

1031
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:59,619
<font color="#00ff00">Give me what I've always</font>
<font color="#00ff00">wanted - a singing career.</font>

1032
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:02,819
<font color="#00ff00">Make something of my life.</font>

1033
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,779
Leave all this behind, yeah?

1034
01:01:04,819 --> 01:01:06,779
<font color="#00ff00">I guess.</font>

1035
01:01:06,819 --> 01:01:09,579
Look, you can
deny actually murdering Mr Hurst,

1036
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:10,979
because of course you would,

1037
01:01:11,019 --> 01:01:13,259
but don't tell me his death isn't
something you desired.

1038
01:01:13,299 --> 01:01:15,339
Because it's about to
change your whole life.

1039
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:17,179
<font color="#00ff00">I didn't kill him.</font>

1040
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:18,619
<font color="#00ff00">I have to get back to work.</font>

1041
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:23,859
<font color="#00ffff">Inspector, I found</font>
<font color="#00ffff">something in Tony Hurst's memoir.</font>

1042
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:27,659
<font color="#00ffff">It's to do with Jamie Barton.</font>

1043
01:01:40,299 --> 01:01:41,979
Just got to nip out for a bit,
bud, OK?

1044
01:01:42,019 --> 01:01:43,339
<font color="#ffff00">But you said you would play.</font>

1045
01:01:43,379 --> 01:01:45,939
Yeah, I will,
as soon as I get back, all right?

1046
01:01:45,979 --> 01:01:47,219
I promise.

1047
01:01:49,299 --> 01:01:50,939
I won't be long.

1048
01:01:56,139 --> 01:01:59,019
<font color="#ffff00">This can't be a coincidence,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that he's here on the island</font>

1049
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:00,859
<font color="#ffff00">and never even mentioned it to us.</font>

1050
01:02:00,899 --> 01:02:03,579
HE CLICKS BUTTON REPEATEDLY

1051
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:07,419
<font color="#00ffff">Sir, that's not going to make it</font>
<font color="#00ffff">come any quicker.</font>

1052
01:02:25,379 --> 01:02:27,099
CHILD:<font color="#00ff00">Who is it?</font>

1053
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:29,339
<font color="#ffff00">Ollie, it's the police.</font>

1054
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:32,339
<font color="#ffff00">Do you remember me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from the other day? DS Thomas.</font>

1055
01:02:38,779 --> 01:02:40,419
<font color="#00ff00">Happy Christmas.</font>

1056
01:02:40,459 --> 01:02:42,459
<font color="#ffff00">Did Santa bring you that?</font>

1057
01:02:42,499 --> 01:02:44,659
<font color="#ffff00">You look like a real sheriff now.</font>

1058
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:46,459
Do you want to get to the point?

1059
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,179
<font color="#00ffff">With respect, Inspector,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">maybe just zip it right now.</font>

1060
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:58,739
<font color="#ffff00">So, er, is your dad not here?</font>

1061
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:00,819
<font color="#00ff00">He's downstairs.</font>

1062
01:03:00,859 --> 01:03:02,339
<font color="#ffff00">OK.</font>

1063
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:05,779
<font color="#ffff00">Um, why don't you guys go and look</font>
<font color="#ffff00">if you can find Mr Barton</font>

1064
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:07,379
<font color="#ffff00">and I'll stay here with Ollie?</font>

1065
01:03:17,979 --> 01:03:20,419
Please don't do that, Mr Barton!
Put the gun down.

1066
01:03:20,459 --> 01:03:22,779
<font color="#00ff00">I wasn't going to, I swear.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I'm not going to hurt you.</font>

1067
01:03:22,819 --> 01:03:24,019
<font color="#00ff00">That's not who I am.</font>

1068
01:03:24,059 --> 01:03:25,339
Then put it down.

1069
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:29,499
Now step away.

1070
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,619
<font color="#00ff00">This isn't what you think.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I know it looks bad now, but...</font>

1071
01:03:31,659 --> 01:03:33,459
We know about your mum, Mr Barton.

1072
01:03:33,499 --> 01:03:36,499
She sang that famous song that
Tony Hurst wrote.

1073
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:39,059
Are you telling me it's pure chance
that you're here on this island

1074
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:40,579
and he's been shot?

1075
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:42,059
And now we find a gun.

1076
01:03:43,179 --> 01:03:45,739
Is that what you're telling me?

1077
01:03:45,779 --> 01:03:50,739
<font color="#00ff00">I just wanted money, that's all,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">what she's owed.</font>

1078
01:03:50,779 --> 01:03:53,059
<font color="#00ff00">He made a fortune off that song</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and she got nothing.</font>

1079
01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:55,459
<font color="#00ff00">The only reason</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I came here was for the money.</font>

1080
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,339
<font color="#00ff00">All Mum wanted was to sing.</font>

1081
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:58,899
<font color="#00ff00">That was her dream.</font>

01:04:18,499 --> 01:04:20,179
Yeah, what you got?

01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:22,059
<font color="#ffff00">Apparently Jamie has a gun.</font>

1090
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:23,459
Did Ollie tell you that?

OK.
Thank you.

<font color="#00ff00">What's going on?</font>

1101
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:49,819
Ollie said he found your gun,
the same night Mr Fullwell was shot.

1102
01:04:52,699 --> 01:04:57,099
Mr Barton, your kid is now involved.

1103
01:04:57,139 --> 01:04:59,939
Do you understand?
That's where we are now.

1104
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,739
So, the truth, please.

1105
01:05:01,779 --> 01:05:03,419
Now.

1106
01:05:07,059 --> 01:05:11,499
<font color="#00ff00">Ol, he knew what</font>
<font color="#00ff00">he was getting for Christmas.</font>

1107
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:14,579
<font color="#00ff00">It's a cowboy set, you know,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">toy guns.</font>

1108
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,059
<font color="#00ff00">He went looking</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and he found it and...</font>

<font color="#00ff00">..and...</font>

1110
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:20,819
So you're saying that it
was Ollie that...<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

1111
01:05:20,859 --> 01:05:23,139
<font color="#00ff00">No, no, no, no. I swear that's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">not what happened.</font>

1112
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:25,219
<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>
What then?

1113
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:27,419
<font color="#00ff00">Stuart.</font>

1114
01:05:27,459 --> 01:05:30,659
<font color="#00ff00">He saw Ollie with the gun</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and he realised it wasn't a toy.</font>

1115
01:05:32,379 --> 01:05:34,019
<font color="#00ffff">Wait a minute, let me see that.</font>

1116
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:35,899
So if Mr Fullwell threatened to go
to the police,

1117
01:05:35,939 --> 01:05:37,819
that gives you motive.
<font color="#00ff00">No, I would never do that.</font>

1118
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:39,179
<font color="#00ff00">I would never do that.</font>

1119
01:05:39,219 --> 01:05:41,299
We know you've got motive to
kill Tony Hurst.

1120
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:42,979
<font color="#00ff00">I told you,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I just wanted to scare him.</font>

1121
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:45,379
<font color="#00ff00">I just wanted to pressure him</font>
<font color="#00ff00">into giving my mum what he owes her.</font>

1122
01:05:45,419 --> 01:05:47,499
<font color="#00ff00">I didn't want to kill him.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I didn't want to kill him.</font>

1123
01:05:47,539 --> 01:05:48,819
<font color="#00ffff">Inspector...</font>

1124
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,739
<font color="#00ffff">I think he might be telling</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the truth.</font>

1125
01:05:57,339 --> 01:05:58,939
What?

1126
01:05:58,979 --> 01:06:02,979
<font color="#00ffff">This gun - it didn't fire the shot</font>
<font color="#00ffff">recovered from Tony Hurst's</font>

1127
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:05,699
<font color="#00ffff">body, or Stuart Fullwell's.</font>

1128
01:06:05,739 --> 01:06:07,259
Sorry, what?

1129
01:06:07,299 --> 01:06:09,579
<font color="#00ffff">I measured the barrel of the gun,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">sir.</font>

1130
01:06:09,619 --> 01:06:12,299
<font color="#00ffff">It's not a match for any</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of the bullets that we found.</font>

1131
01:06:12,339 --> 01:06:13,699
<font color="#00ffff">It's a different calibre.</font>

1132
01:06:14,859 --> 01:06:16,779
<font color="#00ffff">He is not the killer.</font>

1133
01:06:20,819 --> 01:06:22,419
He's not the killer.

1134
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:30,259
At every single turn, with every
piece of evidence we uncover,

1135
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:32,699
it makes less and less sense.

1136
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:43,899
It's so damn quiet here.

1137
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:49,379
I mean, look,
there's literally no-one around.

1138
01:06:49,419 --> 01:06:51,459
<font color="#ffff00">Well, it is Christmas Day, sir.</font>

1139
01:06:52,419 --> 01:06:55,099
<font color="#ffff00">And do you have to keep criticising</font>
<font color="#ffff00">every single thing about</font>

1140
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:56,259
<font color="#ffff00">this island?</font>

1141
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:58,739
<font color="#ffff00">Because when you do it's very hard</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for us not to take it personally.</font>

1142
01:07:00,739 --> 01:07:01,779
Pull over.

1143
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:02,859
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

1144
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:04,139
Pull over. Now!

1145
01:07:05,979 --> 01:07:07,299
Basketball.

1146
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:18,019
FYI, it isn't personal.

1147
01:07:19,219 --> 01:07:21,859
All right?
And I'm sorry you felt that.

1148
01:07:21,899 --> 01:07:23,579
It wasn't intended.

1149
01:07:23,619 --> 01:07:27,379
cos, for the record, the only
thing that's made it vaguely

1150
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:30,899
bearable, the last few days,
is the fact that you

1151
01:07:30,939 --> 01:07:33,459
and Officer Curtis do actually
seem to know what you're doing.

1152
01:07:33,499 --> 01:07:36,419
Anyway, as I was saying, basketball.

1153
01:07:36,459 --> 01:07:38,499
<font color="#ffff00">But why are you going to the...?</font>

1154
01:07:40,379 --> 01:07:42,459
<font color="#ffff00">Really wish he'd stop doing that.</font>

1155
01:07:47,019 --> 01:07:50,459
<font color="#00ffff">No, the boy's mother is already</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on a flight over.</font>

1156
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:53,779
<font color="#00ffff">We just need some care for him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">temporarily.</font>

1157
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,499
<font color="#00ffff">He's in the hotel</font>
<font color="#00ffff">creche at the moment.</font>

1158
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:00,139
<font color="#00ffff">Yes. Thank you. Bye.</font>

1159
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:05,299
<font color="#ffff00">Inspector Wilson?</font>

1160
01:08:05,339 --> 01:08:06,739
<font color="#00ffff">No idea.</font>

1161
01:08:06,779 --> 01:08:09,419
<font color="#00ffff">He and DS Thomas should have been</font>
<font color="#00ffff">back a while ago.</font>

1162
01:08:12,139 --> 01:08:15,179
PHONE RINGS

1163
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:21,219
<font color="#ffff00">Where are you both? Sorry?</font>

1164
01:08:23,419 --> 01:08:24,499
<font color="#ffff00">Where?</font>

1165
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:36,099

01:08:37,499 --> 01:08:40,099
<font color="#00ffff">He just stood there</font>
<font color="#00ffff">staring for a while,</font>

1168
01:08:40,139 --> 01:08:42,579
<font color="#00ffff">then moved around the court a bit,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and now...</font>

01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:45,619
<font color="#00ff00">He's not very good, is he?</font>

1170
01:08:49,379 --> 01:08:50,939
Commissioner.

1171
01:08:50,979 --> 01:08:52,379
<font color="#ffff00">Inspector.</font>

1172
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:54,939
<font color="#ffff00">Is it normal for you to play</font>
<font color="#ffff00">basketball in the midst</font>

1173

<font color="#ffff00">of a murder case?</font>

1174
01:08:56,379 --> 01:08:59,019
I've never played before in my life,
to be honest with you.

1175
01:08:59,059 --> 01:09:01,579
Probably explains why
I keep missing, right?

1176
01:09:01,619 --> 01:09:03,859
<font color="#ffff00">That doesn't answer my question.</font>

1177
01:09:05,459 --> 01:09:07,179
Visualisation.

1178
01:09:07,219 --> 01:09:10,219
Um, three victims, one gun.

1179
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:12,139
Three hoops, one ball.

1180
01:09:12,179 --> 01:09:17,779
How can I shoot three hoops with one
ball at the exact same time?

1181
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:19,499
<font color="#ffff00">You can't.</font>
Exactly.

1182
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:23,499
<font color="#ffff00">Inspector.</font>

1183
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:26,379
<font color="#ffff00">This case is proving to be...</font>

1184
01:09:26,419 --> 01:09:27,819
How?

1185
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:30,099
<font color="#ffff00">..increasingly challenging.</font>

1186
01:09:30,139 --> 01:09:31,619
I know, right?

1187
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:40,259
<font color="#ffff00">I came here because I've been</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in contact with the team in London,</font>

1188
01:09:40,299 --> 01:09:44,739
<font color="#ffff00">and they have a detective ready to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">fly over here this evening.</font>

1189
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:48,779
What? Why?

1190
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:50,259
<font color="#ffff00">To take over the case.</font>

1191
01:09:53,019 --> 01:09:54,819
Why would they do that?

1192
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:57,779
<font color="#ffff00">In light of your personal</font>
<font color="#ffff00">circumstances,</font>

1193
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:01,379
<font color="#ffff00">I feel I have a duty of care.</font>

1194
01:10:01,419 --> 01:10:05,099
<font color="#ffff00">And considering all you've been</font>
<font color="#ffff00">through in the last few days,</font>

1195
01:10:05,139 --> 01:10:08,339
<font color="#ffff00">perhaps you are not the best</font>
<font color="#ffff00">person to be leading such</font>

1196
01:10:08,379 --> 01:10:11,059
<font color="#ffff00">a demanding investigation.</font>

1197
01:10:11,099 --> 01:10:14,539
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe it was just not meant to be.</font>

1198
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:21,499
<font color="#00ff00">I swear, I'm not going to hurt you.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">That's not who I am.</font>

1199
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:23,819
<font color="#00ffff">Half past nine, he headed back</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to his bedroom to get changed.</font>

1200
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:25,939
<font color="#00ffff">I measured the barrel of the gun,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">sir.</font>

1201
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:27,699
<font color="#00ffff">It's a different calibre.</font>

1202
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:29,139
<font color="#ffff00">Inspector?</font>

1203
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:36,379
Maybe it wasn't meant to be.

1204
01:10:38,659 --> 01:10:41,859
And if it wasn't meant to be,
then what was?

1205
01:10:41,899 --> 01:10:43,419
And-and when?

1206
01:10:45,739 --> 01:10:47,459
OK.

1207
01:10:50,059 --> 01:10:53,019
Yes!
Victim number one.

1208
01:10:53,059 --> 01:10:55,699
<font color="#00ff00">I have no idea what's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">going on right now.</font>

1209
01:10:55,739 --> 01:10:59,379
<font color="#00ff00">And judging by the Commissioner's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">face, he doesn't either.</font>

1210
01:10:59,419 --> 01:11:02,219
<font color="#00ffff">But something tells me HE does.</font>

1211
01:11:05,299 --> 01:11:07,219
I need the other ball.

1212
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:10,019
Come on!

1213
01:11:12,859 --> 01:11:14,619
It wasn't meant to be.

1214
01:11:14,659 --> 01:11:15,979
Your words.

1215
01:11:16,019 --> 01:11:17,859
And that's the point, isn't it?

1216
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:20,619
Yeah, because if things don't go
the way you expect it to,

1217
01:11:20,659 --> 01:11:22,819
then all you can do is play
the hand you're dealt.

1218
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:25,539
And that's what our killer did.

1219
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:30,019
Victim number two.

1220
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,899
When I say shoot,
I want you to shoot.

1221
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:38,379
Yeah? Please, sir.

1222
01:11:41,619 --> 01:11:43,579
Victim number three.

1223
01:11:45,619 --> 01:11:47,219
Ready?

1224
01:11:48,899 --> 01:11:50,019
Shoot!

1225
01:11:52,579 --> 01:11:54,499
That's how!

1226
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:57,539
<font color="#00ffff">That means the shooting must have</font>
<font color="#00ffff">happened about 10:15.</font>

1227
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,139
<font color="#00ff00">10:15.</font>

1228
01:11:59,179 --> 01:12:01,659
<font color="#ffff00">10:15,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I remember noticing.</font>

1229
01:12:01,699 --> 01:12:05,259
All three victims were shot
by the same gun, at the same time,

1230
01:12:05,299 --> 01:12:07,219
in three separate locations.

1231
01:12:07,259 --> 01:12:08,859
That's exactly how.

1232
01:12:12,139 --> 01:12:14,299
It is NOT impossible.

1233
01:12:15,659 --> 01:12:17,579
<font color="#ffff00">You know how it was done?</font>

1234
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:21,299
I know how it ALL was done.

1235
01:12:21,339 --> 01:12:26,099
But, um, Officer Curtis, I need you
to do something for me first.

1236
01:12:26,139 --> 01:12:29,699
Um, Jamie Barton's gun - I need you
to check it for fingerprints,

1237
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:33,339
because I don't think it's
Jamie's gun.

1238
01:12:33,379 --> 01:12:34,899
<font color="#00ffff">Sure, Inspector.</font>

1239
01:12:36,339 --> 01:12:41,299
If I'm right, and I think I am, then
we should go and make an arrest.

1240
01:12:41,339 --> 01:12:44,499
<font color="#ffff00">Uh-uh-uh, actually, Inspector,</font>

1241
01:12:44,539 --> 01:12:47,739
<font color="#ffff00">we tend to do things a little</font>
<font color="#ffff00">differently here.</font>

1242
01:12:48,979 --> 01:12:51,659
Sorry? What do you mean?

1243
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:58,179
Why can't I just write it
up in the case file?

1244
01:12:58,219 --> 01:13:00,499
I mean, that is
standard procedure, right?

1245
01:13:01,739 --> 01:13:04,419
<font color="#ffff00">Let's say it's a</font>
<font color="#ffff00">matter of tradition.</font>

1246
01:13:05,659 --> 01:13:06,739
<font color="#ffff00">If you would?</font>

1247
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:12,059
Ahem.

1248
01:13:16,699 --> 01:13:22,779
I assume you're all wondering why
you're gathered here like this.

1249
01:13:24,139 --> 01:13:26,699
I'm wondering the same thing myself,
to be honest.

1250
01:13:26,739 --> 01:13:30,859
But as this case has confounded us
at every turn,

1251
01:13:30,899 --> 01:13:33,939
I suppose one last surprise
shouldn't be too unexpected.

1252
01:13:33,979 --> 01:13:35,579
And you know what?

1253
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:37,939
In a funny way,
that's what this has all been about.

1254
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:39,499
Expectation.

1255
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:43,019
What we think is going to happen,
and what does.

1256
01:13:43,059 --> 01:13:44,819
I mean, take me, for instance.

1257
01:13:44,859 --> 01:13:48,139
A few days ago, here I was on this
island, a mere tourist.

1258
01:13:49,539 --> 01:13:52,979
And yet now, I'm heading up
one of the most puzzling murder

1259
01:13:53,019 --> 01:13:54,539
cases I've ever encountered.

1260
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:58,299
Didn't see that one coming
a mile off.

1261
01:13:58,339 --> 01:14:00,899
But then, as I said to
Commissioner Patterson,

1262
01:14:00,939 --> 01:14:03,619
we play the hand we're dealt,

1263
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:09,139
and that's the key to understanding
this case, because as planned as

1264
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:14,499
it may seem - three victims in Santa
Claus outfits, all of whom were

1265
01:14:14,539 --> 01:14:18,619
shot at the exact same time in three
different locations with just

1266
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:24,019
one gun - as contrived as it may
appear,

1267
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,859
none of it was meant to
happen.

1268
01:14:25,899 --> 01:14:29,499
Let's go back to the evening
it all started.

1269
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:33,579
At 9:30, Stuart Fullwell headed
back to his hotel...

1270
01:14:37,699 --> 01:14:41,339
{\an8}Stuart Fullwell headed back
to his hotel to get changed

1271
01:14:41,379 --> 01:14:44,139
{\an8}out of his Santa Claus outfit.

1272
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:48,179
{\an8}And on the way he comes
across a little boy, your son Ollie,

1273
01:14:48,219 --> 01:14:51,499
out playing cowboys near the beach.

1274
01:14:51,539 --> 01:14:54,499
And when Stuart notices the gun that
little Ollie was playing with

1275
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:56,019
was real...

1276
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:58,139
..he becomes concerned.

1277
01:14:58,179 --> 01:15:01,259
Now, that gun, let's call it Gun A.

1278
01:15:02,659 --> 01:15:05,059
That wasn't the gun we found you
with earlier this morning,

1279
01:15:05,099 --> 01:15:06,579
was it, Mr Barton?

1280
01:15:06,619 --> 01:15:08,859
Despite you leading us
to think it was,

1281
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:11,899
it was a different gun, you acquired
to threaten Tony Hurst.

1282
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:14,979
And when Stuart confronted
you about seeing little

1283
01:15:15,019 --> 01:15:17,939
Ollie in possession of it, I think
you sent Ollie back

1284
01:15:17,979 --> 01:15:20,939
to your hotel room, and the two
of you went somewhere quiet to talk.

1285
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:22,419
<font color="#00ffff">I'm taking this to the police.</font>

1286
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:25,179
<font color="#00ff00">No, please, I'll be arrested.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">No, you can't.</font>

1287
01:15:25,219 --> 01:15:27,539
I don't believe you intended to
shoot Stuart.

1288
01:15:27,579 --> 01:15:29,539
Like you said, you're not a killer.

1289
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:31,459
It's just not in you.

1290
01:15:31,499 --> 01:15:34,539
But I think you tried to get
the gun off him.

1291
01:15:34,579 --> 01:15:36,619
<font color="#00ff00">You can't - you can't do this.</font>

1292
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:39,459
<font color="#00ff00">Just, please...</font>
GUNSHOT

1293
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,699
In that tussle, the gun went off.

1294
01:15:48,379 --> 01:15:52,339
<font color="#00ff00">I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.</font>

1295
01:15:53,579 --> 01:15:56,219
<font color="#ffff00">So it was an accident?</font>

1296
01:15:56,259 --> 01:15:58,979
But the other two
shootings were not.

1297
01:16:00,339 --> 01:16:03,779
And now we know there was a second
gun involved, it's not too

1298
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:06,339
much of a leap to work out there was
a second person involved.

1299
01:16:06,379 --> 01:16:08,899
Isn't that right, Kenny Simmons?

1300
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,699
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry?</font>

1301
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:14,819
We know you had very good
reason for wanting Tony Hurst dead.

1302
01:16:14,859 --> 01:16:18,379
With him out of the way, his record
company would let you release

1303
01:16:18,419 --> 01:16:21,659
your song, which was guaranteed to
make you a small fortune.

1304
01:16:21,699 --> 01:16:24,539
And Stuart Fullwell's death
provided some useful

1305
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:27,059
misdirection for Tony Hurst's
murder.

1306
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:28,539
<font color="#00ffff">I didn't do anything.</font>

1307
01:16:28,579 --> 01:16:30,099
Yes, you did, Kenny.

1308
01:16:30,139 --> 01:16:33,739
We found your fingerprints on the
gun we recovered from Mr Barton

1309
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:36,259
this morning, so we have evidence
you were involved.

1310
01:16:36,299 --> 01:16:39,619
And assuming Mr Barton here wants to
receive the smallest sentence

1311
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:42,219
he can get, I don't think he's
going to take the rap for all this.

1312
01:16:42,259 --> 01:16:44,459
Are you, Mr Barton?
<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

1313
01:16:45,859 --> 01:16:47,139
No.

1314
01:16:47,179 --> 01:16:50,099
So...here's what happened.

1315
01:16:51,379 --> 01:16:55,539
I think Kenny witnessed what took
place on the beach that night...

1316
01:16:55,579 --> 01:16:56,939
..when the gun went off
accidentally.

1317
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,699
GUNSHOT

1318
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,339
And in that moment, his plan
began to form.

1319
01:17:01,379 --> 01:17:03,019
<font color="#00ff00">I didn't mean to.</font>

1320
01:17:04,779 --> 01:17:06,379
<font color="#00ffff">I know what to do.</font>

1321
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:11,099
A plan to make three different
shootings look like they all

1322
01:17:11,139 --> 01:17:13,699
happened at the same time.

1323
01:17:13,739 --> 01:17:17,219
We know that Stuart Fullwell left
the bar at 9:30 and,

1324
01:17:17,259 --> 01:17:19,899
it turns out,
was shot not long after.

1325
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:21,979
Not at 10:15.

1326
01:17:22,019 --> 01:17:25,339
<font color="#ffff00">But Ollie said that he came straight</font>
<font color="#ffff00">down to reception after it happened.</font>

1327
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:27,339
He lied.

1328
01:17:27,379 --> 01:17:30,379
He simply waited
and went down to reception later.

1329
01:17:30,419 --> 01:17:33,139
Why? Because that's what his dad
told him to do.

1330
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:37,979
<font color="#00ffff">I think there's a dead man,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on the beach.</font>

1331
01:17:38,019 --> 01:17:40,739
And who would disbelieve
a seven-year-old kid?

1332
01:17:40,779 --> 01:17:42,339
We certainly didn't.

1333
01:17:42,379 --> 01:17:45,259
In fact, all throughout the case,
we took little Ollie at his word,

1334
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:50,619
working on the basis that the first
"murder" happened at 10:15.

1335
01:17:50,659 --> 01:17:53,139
Which brings us to the
second shooting,

1336
01:17:53,179 --> 01:17:55,179
which did happen at that time -
10:15.

1337
01:17:55,219 --> 01:17:57,539
GUNSHOT

1338
01:17:57,579 --> 01:18:01,099
It was Kenny who took that same gun
that accidentally killed

1339
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:05,779
Stuart Fullwell, Gun A,
and used it to shoot Tony Hurst.

1340
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:10,099
I assume, having used his track on
your own song, done your research,

1341
01:18:10,139 --> 01:18:13,899
you already knew that Tony kept
the costume he wore 40 years ago.

1342
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,179
<font color="#00ffff">Get inside.</font>

1343
01:18:16,619 --> 01:18:21,099
It wasn't vital to the plan, but it
added another layer of mystery

1344
01:18:21,139 --> 01:18:24,179
that would add to our confusion.

1345
01:18:24,219 --> 01:18:26,899
And so while it was being
recorded on camera...

1346
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:29,219
<font color="#00ff00">Don't do this.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I'm begging you.</font>

1347
01:18:29,259 --> 01:18:31,739
<font color="#00ff00">You don't have to do this.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Just tell me what it is you want.</font>

1348
01:18:31,779 --> 01:18:33,019
<font color="#00ff00">We can work something out.</font>

1349
01:18:33,059 --> 01:18:34,459
GUNSHOT

1350
01:18:38,179 --> 01:18:44,219
Which leaves us our third
and final victim - Tyrus Demille.

1351
01:18:44,259 --> 01:18:47,059
The solution to which can be
found in the fact that there was a

1352
01:18:47,099 --> 01:18:50,099
second,
different gun at play - Gun B,

1353
01:18:50,139 --> 01:18:53,539
if you will - which
I believe belongs to you, Kenny.

1354
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:56,219
And so,
while you were about to murder

1355
01:18:56,259 --> 01:19:00,899
Tony Hurst on the dot of 10:15,
you told Jamie to follow Tyrus as

1356
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:04,939
he headed home, and at that exact
same time, at 10:15, fire off a

1357
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:08,979
few rounds in his general direction
with Gun B, but without killing him.

1358
01:19:10,299 --> 01:19:11,659
<font color="#ffff00">Somebody there?</font>

1359
01:19:11,699 --> 01:19:14,379
GUNSHOT

1360
01:19:15,859 --> 01:19:18,379
I believe, Jamie,
once Tyrus had fled,

1361
01:19:18,419 --> 01:19:21,899
you recovered the three bullets
you'd fired from Gun B, and on

1362
01:19:21,939 --> 01:19:25,699
the way back from Tony Hurst's
villa, you released three rounds

1363
01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:28,539
from Gun A into the same place,
so that when we found them,

1364
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:30,139
they would be a match for the

1365
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:33,179
bullets fired into the first two
victims.

1366
01:19:33,219 --> 01:19:36,499
I assume you agreed not to talk or
interact with each other

1367
01:19:36,539 --> 01:19:39,139
when it was done,
so as not to raise any suspicion.

1368
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:42,299
But it did mean you were each left
with the other's gun,

1369
01:19:42,339 --> 01:19:44,939
and that's why we found you still
in possession of it, Mr Barton,

1370
01:19:44,979 --> 01:19:47,739
waiting to return it to Mr Simmons.

1371
01:19:47,779 --> 01:19:50,259
<font color="#00ff00">But why shoot another person?</font>

1372
01:19:50,299 --> 01:19:54,379
To confuse us, the police, with
none of the victims or the suspects

1373
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:57,579
having any apparent connection
to Tyrus Demille.

1374
01:19:57,619 --> 01:20:00,019
That was the whole point, wasn't it?

1375
01:20:00,059 --> 01:20:03,139
None of it was meant to make any
sense at any point at all.

1376
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:06,059
You just wanted to send us
on a merry dance,

1377
01:20:06,099 --> 01:20:08,859
going round in round in circles
endlessly.

1378
01:20:08,899 --> 01:20:11,499
An unsolvable case.

1379
01:20:11,539 --> 01:20:13,139
And you know what?

1380
01:20:13,179 --> 01:20:18,459
I'll admit it, it almost,
very nearly, had me beat.

1381
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:21,779
Well and truly.

1382
01:20:22,779 --> 01:20:25,059
<font color="#00ffff">Then I guess it was worth a try.</font>

1383
01:20:27,579 --> 01:20:29,299
You can make your arrest.

1384
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:35,139
<font color="#00ff00">He is annoying, but he's good, eh?</font>

1385
01:20:37,979 --> 01:20:40,179
<font color="#00ff00">You do not have to say anything...</font>

1386
01:20:40,219 --> 01:20:44,619
<font color="#ffff00">Well done, Inspector.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">And - thank you.</font>

1387
01:20:44,659 --> 01:20:47,499
Sure.<font color="#00ff00">..you later rely on in court.</font>

1388
01:20:47,539 --> 01:20:50,259
<font color="#ffff00">Is something the matter?</font>

1389
01:20:50,299 --> 01:20:53,019
Well, I just don't see why that was
entirely necessary.

1390
01:20:53,059 --> 01:20:55,379
I'd prefer to just write it
up in the case report.

1391
01:20:55,419 --> 01:20:57,099
<font color="#ffff00">We do that here as well.</font>

1392
01:20:58,819 --> 01:21:00,619
Well, each to his own, I suppose.

1393
01:21:02,339 --> 01:21:06,539
<font color="#ffff00">Officer Curtis, would you be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">so good as to let Officer Myers</font>

1394
01:21:06,579 --> 01:21:09,419
<font color="#ffff00">and Tyrus Demille know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">they are free to go?</font>

1395
01:21:09,459 --> 01:21:11,019
<font color="#00ff00">OK, sir. Come on.</font>

1396
01:21:28,819 --> 01:21:30,979
<font color="#00ffff">Thanks for what you did today.</font>

1397
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,579
<font color="#00ffff">You made me daughter's Christmas.</font>

1398
01:21:32,619 --> 01:21:36,299
<font color="#ffff00">No, you did, with a little</font>
<font color="#ffff00">bit of help from the puppy!</font>

1399
01:21:36,339 --> 01:21:37,699
<font color="#ffff00">Go on.</font>

1400
01:21:39,259 --> 01:21:42,339
<font color="#00ffff">Listen,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">if the radio is still not working,</font>

1401
01:21:42,379 --> 01:21:44,739
<font color="#00ffff">tell your auntie to bring</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it down the harbour.</font>

1402
01:21:44,779 --> 01:21:46,499
<font color="#00ffff">I'll sort it.</font>

1403
01:21:46,539 --> 01:21:48,139
<font color="#00ffff">No receipt required.</font>

1404
01:21:48,179 --> 01:21:50,179
<font color="#ffff00">I'll believe it when I see it.</font>

1405
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:52,499
<font color="#ffff00">Now go and spend some time</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with your daughter.</font>

1406
01:21:52,539 --> 01:21:53,899
<font color="#00ffff">Yes I.</font>

1407
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:58,099
<font color="#ffff00">Driver. Allez.</font>

1408
01:22:02,899 --> 01:22:04,859
<font color="#00ff00">How'd it go? Anything to report?</font>

1409
01:22:04,899 --> 01:22:06,299
<font color="#ffff00">Nope.</font>

1410
01:22:06,339 --> 01:22:07,459
<font color="#ffff00">Cool as ice.</font>

1411
01:22:07,499 --> 01:22:09,019
<font color="#ffff00">Just like me.</font>

1412
01:22:09,059 --> 01:22:11,059
<font color="#00ff00">So, here's a funny thing.</font>

1413
01:22:11,099 --> 01:22:14,339
<font color="#00ff00">There I was with the Inspector</font>
<font color="#00ff00">earlier today,</font>

1414
01:22:14,379 --> 01:22:17,859
<font color="#00ff00">on the hotel beach, dealing with</font>
<font color="#00ff00">quite an intense situation.</font>

1415
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:20,619
<font color="#ffff00">Oh?</font> <font color="#00ff00">I measured the barrel of the</font>
<font color="#00ff00">gun, sir.</font>

1416
01:22:20,659 --> 01:22:21,979
<font color="#00ff00">It's a different calibre.</font>

1417
01:22:22,019 --> 01:22:23,739
<font color="#00ff00">And what do you think I see?</font>

1418
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:25,899
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know, Darlene,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">what did you see?</font>

1419
01:22:25,939 --> 01:22:28,259
<font color="#00ff00">Three men on a boat...</font>

1420
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:34,179
<font color="#00ff00">..who all looked very familiar to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">me.</font>

1421
01:22:34,219 --> 01:22:36,259
<font color="#00ff00">One of them looked like your father.</font>

1422
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:38,379
<font color="#00ff00">One of them looked a bit like Tyrus.</font>

1423
01:22:38,419 --> 01:22:43,499
<font color="#00ff00">And one of them...looked like you,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Dwayne Myers.</font>

1424
01:22:43,539 --> 01:22:47,539
<font color="#00ff00">So much so that</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I almost thought it was you.</font>

1425
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:52,859
<font color="#00ff00">But then I remembered, you were</font>
<font color="#00ff00">locked away in the safehouse, so...</font>

1426
01:22:52,899 --> 01:22:54,459
<font color="#00ff00">..it can't have been.</font>

1427
01:22:54,499 --> 01:22:57,059
<font color="#ffff00">That's the strangest thing I've</font>
<font color="#ffff00">ever heard in my life.</font>

1428
01:22:57,099 --> 01:22:59,659
<font color="#ffff00">In fact,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's almost impossible to believe!</font>

1429
01:23:03,899 --> 01:23:06,019
SHE SUCKS HER TEETH

1430
01:23:06,059 --> 01:23:07,259
<font color="#00ff00">Huh!</font>

1431
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:16,299
# You can take a boy from the
country... #

1432
01:23:18,219 --> 01:23:19,859
<font color="#ffff00">Inspector.</font>

1433
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:22,859
Commissioner.

1434
01:23:22,899 --> 01:23:24,779
<font color="#ffff00">Just thought I'd pop by.</font>

1435
01:23:24,819 --> 01:23:28,019
<font color="#ffff00">Wanted to make sure you're</font>
<font color="#ffff00">positive you won't join us</font>

1436
01:23:28,059 --> 01:23:29,619
<font color="#ffff00">for Christmas dinner.</font>

1437
01:23:29,659 --> 01:23:31,379
Er, yeah, I'm positive.

1438
01:23:31,419 --> 01:23:35,259
I mean, thanks again, but
I need to finish this case report.

1439
01:23:35,299 --> 01:23:40,099
Sooner it's done,
sooner I'm out of here, right? What?

1440
01:23:41,299 --> 01:23:44,899
<font color="#ffff00">Just to say there is no great</font>
<font color="#ffff00">rush for you to leave.</font>

1441
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:46,979
Meaning?

1442
01:23:47,019 --> 01:23:49,859
<font color="#ffff00">We are still in need</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of a permanent DI here.</font>

1443
01:23:54,139 --> 01:23:57,339
Me? You're joking.

1444
01:23:57,379 --> 01:23:58,379
Right?

1445
01:23:59,619 --> 01:24:00,819
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

1446
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:03,059
No.

1447
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:06,499
Right, well, I'm surprised you
think that's a good idea,

1448
01:24:06,539 --> 01:24:08,299
to be honest with you.

1449
01:24:08,339 --> 01:24:12,859
<font color="#ffff00">I thought you might be, but I think</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you might make a good fit here.</font>

1450
01:24:14,859 --> 01:24:17,579
It's like you don't know me at all.

1451
01:24:20,579 --> 01:24:25,219
<font color="#ffff00">I know you feel this island doesn't</font>
<font color="#ffff00">offer as much as it did</font>

1452
01:24:25,259 --> 01:24:26,219
<font color="#ffff00">when you arrived.</font>

1453
01:24:27,779 --> 01:24:29,419
<font color="#ffff00">But is that a reason to leave?</font>

1454
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:36,739
<font color="#ffff00">Perhaps by getting to know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Saint Marie, the island where</font>

1455
01:24:36,779 --> 01:24:41,939
<font color="#ffff00">your mother spent her life, you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">might get to know a little of her?</font>

1456
01:24:43,179 --> 01:24:44,779
OK, look, um...

1457
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:49,619
I'm flattered and everything,
but it's just not an option.

1458
01:24:49,659 --> 01:24:53,419
I just want to get back to
London, ASAP.

1459
01:24:53,459 --> 01:24:55,139
<font color="#ffff00">I understand, Inspector.</font>

1460
01:24:59,779 --> 01:25:02,339
<font color="#ffff00">Merry Christmas.</font>

1461
01:25:02,379 --> 01:25:04,059
And to you, sir.

1462
01:25:09,019 --> 01:25:11,499
<font color="#00ffff">So what do you reckon?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Get back out...</font>

1463
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:14,539
<font color="#00ffff">..to sea tomorrow, catch ourselves</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a few snapper?</font>

1464
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:16,419
<font color="#ffff00">Sounds like a good plan to me.</font>

1465
01:25:16,459 --> 01:25:19,699
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, and just to let you know, we are</font>
<font color="#ffff00">going to be having quite</font>

1466
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:22,139
<font color="#ffff00">a few more days like that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">ahead of us in the future.</font>

1467
01:25:22,179 --> 01:25:23,739
<font color="#00ffff">Oh?</font> <font color="#ffff00">Mm.</font>

1468
01:25:23,779 --> 01:25:25,699
<font color="#ffff00">I've already told the Commissioner.</font>

1469
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:29,579
<font color="#ffff00">I've officially told him that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going to be handing my badge in.</font>

1470
01:25:29,619 --> 01:25:35,579
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. I've just realised that there</font>
<font color="#ffff00">are far more important things</font>

1471
01:25:35,619 --> 01:25:38,139
<font color="#ffff00">I need to be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">doing in my life right now.</font>

1472
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:40,099
<font color="#00ffff">Sounds like a good plan to me.</font>

1473
01:25:40,139 --> 01:25:43,339
<font color="#ffff00">Mm.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, they're waiting.</font>

1474
01:25:43,379 --> 01:25:45,539
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, here they come.</font>

1475
01:25:46,859 --> 01:25:50,579
<font color="#00ff00">Just...in time.</font>

1476
01:25:52,019 --> 01:25:56,339
<font color="#00ff00">Thank you.</font> <font color="#ffff00">So, where's this new</font>
<font color="#ffff00">detective?</font>

1477
01:25:56,379 --> 01:25:59,059
Mervin declined
the offer of Christmas dinner.

1478
01:25:59,099 --> 01:26:00,419
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, really?</font>

1479
01:26:00,459 --> 01:26:03,219
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, he's...he's a bit like that.</font>

1480
01:26:03,259 --> 01:26:04,539
Rude!

1481
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:07,859
<font color="#00ffff">He just likes to do his own thing.</font>

1482
01:26:12,259 --> 01:26:15,259
<font color="#00ff00">A little bird tells me</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that you're hanging up your uniform,</font>

1483
01:26:15,299 --> 01:26:16,859
<font color="#00ff00">to spend more time with your father.</font>

1484
01:26:16,899 --> 01:26:18,659
<font color="#ffff00">Mm.</font>

1485
01:26:18,699 --> 01:26:20,979
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I couldn't do both things.</font>

1486
01:26:22,299 --> 01:26:25,219
<font color="#00ff00">You know, I never thought I'd</font>
<font color="#00ff00">actually say this,</font>

1487
01:26:25,259 --> 01:26:28,939
<font color="#00ff00">but...you are a good man,</font>
