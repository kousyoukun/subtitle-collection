00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,448
Agent Lewis
uncovered a mass grave.

3
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,073
She'll be staying
in Washington State.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,341
I'm gonna need some help.

5
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,009
Tara Lewis.

6
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,236
Looks like there's been

7
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,688
an active killer
up here for decades.

8
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,081
We got 16 dead bodies
in a buried shipping container.

9
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,468
When's the last time
David Rossi was in the office?

10
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,694
People are saying
this past year,

11
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,420
Agent Rossi's been obsessed.

12
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,665
All those years working in
the basement caught up with him.

13
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,833
What're you working on?

14
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,426
Westbrook family in Alexandria.

15
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,228
This isn't about invasion.

16
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,697
It's about destruction
of a family.

17
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,135
Chrissy Delaney was targeted
on "SOAR."

18
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,237
That's impossible.
Luke, "SOAR" is unhackable.

19
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,614
I know.
I'm the one that secured it.

20
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,708
It's sophisticated
for a 19-year-old kid.

21
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,043
What are the chances
we have identical foot lockers

22
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,211
on opposite coasts?

23
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,647
We need all eyes on this.

24
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,433
What...

25
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:07,734
What is...

26
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,139
I don't feel so good.

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,780
One, two, three.

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,391
What's... What's going on?

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,662
What...

30
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,831
What are you...

31
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,834
Can you feel that?

32
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,436
No.
Good.

33
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,172
No, man, I c...
I can't feel anything.

34
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,374
Wh...

35
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,710
Wait, wait, wait, no!
P-P-Please stop!

36
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,512
Stop! What are you doing to me?
Shh! Shh!

37
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,547
What are you doing?

38
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,584
Shh! I want you to listen
very carefully.

39
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,525
Because you have
a choice to make.

is our 13-year-old's friend

00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,510

'Cause I got us a table at
that new Italian place tonight.

00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,548
Ooh, Italiano.

70
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,882
Yeah.

71
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,484
Tonight.

72
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,420
Yeah, tonight's date night.

73
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,992
Uh, another body
turned up this morning.

74
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,927
Rock Creek Park.

75
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:21,994
Alright.

00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,397
It's alright.

77
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,300
Uh, hey, hang on.

78
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,770
Might be able to shuffle
some things... around.

79
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,972
No, don't do that.

80
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,908
But can you, uh,
confirm something for me?

81
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,544
So I can tell myself
I'm not going crazy?

82
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,016
You've had a lot on your
shoulders since we got back.

83
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,385
Like, a lot.

84
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,655
And I know you're supermom
and the boys aren't suffering.

85
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,425
But, um...

86
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,531
Um, you're talking about us?

87
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,999
Yeah.

88
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,834
Kinda.

89
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,473
Okay, just...

90
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,842
Just give me...
Give me a chance.

91
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,578
Alright?
To make it up to you.

92
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,614
I will.

93
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,016
I swear.

94
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,785
Okay.

95
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,453
Have a good day.

96
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,634
Morning.
How was your night?

97
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,369
Fine.
How was yours?

98
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,737
Good.

99
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:42,341
You, uh, still living
out of that hotel, Dave?

100
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,578
What's the case?

101
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,780
This one is in our backyard.

102
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,750
Four days ago,
Alex Arnold was dumped

103
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,453
at a rest stop
outside of Silver Spring.

104
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,988
Cause of death
was a severed spinal cord.

105
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,759
Last night, it went serial
with Steve Duncan.

106
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,862
Same COD, severed spinal cord.

107
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,864
Good-looking men in their 30s,

108
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,100
not a victimology
we see a lot of.

109
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,068
They're usually the UnSubs.

110
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,772
Well, these two were targeted
for a very specific reason.

111
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,776
They both had apps
like Tinder, Feeld,

112
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,878
Adult Friend Finder
on their phone.

113
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,048
That is where they advertise
their services as bulls.

114
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,584
Are bulls the same thing
as studs?

115
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,785
Close.

116
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,154
In the kink known as cuckolding,

117
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,690
wives cheat on
their husbands with bulls.

118
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,125
Men like this.

119
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,627
No money trades hands.

120
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,663
It's all legal and consensual.

121
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,565
The UnSub could have been
burned by that.

122
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,400
Now he's taking his revenge.

123
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,903
There is another reason
why we have to take this case.

124
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,672
Our last UnSub, Rory Gilcrest,

125
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,675
he switched cars
at a Wal-Mart parking lot.

126
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,912
This UnSub did the same thing.
Down to the Wal-Mart.

127
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,414
We profiled that Rory
had a partner.

128
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,749
But, I mean...

129
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,584
Is this our
shipping container guy?

130
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:59,919
I checked with Tara.

131
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,054
None of the bodies
in the shipping container

132
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,557
have severed spinal cords.

133
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,026
Yes, this is
a very specific signature,

134
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,797
but we can't ignore
what's in front of us.

135
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,699
Details from our last case
are showing up here.

136
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,536
Then there's another theory
we have to consider.

137
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,504
Who's ever behind
the shipping container

138
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,706
doesn't have one partner.

139
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,008
He has two.

140
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,013
So, the plan here
is standard operating procedure.

141
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,648
We are processing
the photographs,

142
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,917
but our main focus
is a complete DNA breakdown.

143
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,685
Once the samples
are crossed and typed,

144
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,489
we can ID bodies and then,
fingers crossed, our UnSub.

145
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,458
Locard's Exchange Principle
says that a perpetrator

146
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,094
takes and leaves something
at every crime scene.

147
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,864
If this guy revisited this
for 17 years,

148
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,033
there's gonna be
some piece of him in there.

149
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,468
Prentiss?
What did you do?

150
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,905
Director Bailey, sir, I had to
move this from Washington State.

151
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,241
The locals didn't have
the resources necessary

152
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,642
to investigate it fully.

153
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,044
And I get it.
I love it.

154
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,779
I love the enthusiasm.

155
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,882
But the brass is not
gonna like this.

156
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,151
The body count's
already gone up to 24,

157
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,652
not counting the bones.

158
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,120
I-I want to be clear here.

159
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:13,125
The brass doesn't want the BAU
solving this case?

160
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,594
It's not that simple.

161
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,731
Let me run it up the flagpole.

162
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,666
Just hope it's worth it.

163
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,803
Get me Director McNamara
in Resource Management.

164
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,574
Man.
You deal with that every day?

165
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,710
Every day.

166
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,546
As if this job
wasn't hard enough.

167
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,773
<i>I want you to listen
very carefully.</i>

168
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,943
<i>Because you have
a choice to make.</i>

169
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,111
<i>I'm going to cut
your spinal cord.</i>

170
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,580
<i>Oh, God.</i>

171
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,785
<i>You can either live
as a quadriplegic.</i>

172
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,355
<i>Control nothing
from the neck down.</i>

173
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,291
<i>Or I kill you.</i>

174
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,061
<i>So what's your choice?</i>

175
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,632
<i>Kill me.</i>

176
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,252
<i>It is claimed
that Oscar Wilde wrote,</i>

177
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:30,056
<i>"Everything in the world
is about sex, except sex.</i>

178
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,992
<i>Sex is about power."</i>

179
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,427
<i>Except he didn't.</i>

180
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,129
<i>Nobody knows who wrote it.</i>

181
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,733
So I combed through
our two victims' cellphones.

182
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,234
And, uh, these bulls,

183
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,438
they made a large number
of women very, very happy.

184
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,006
What're you, jealous?
No.

185
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,075
I respect the sanctity
of marriage too much

186
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,277
to mess with married women.

187
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,712
I was looking for overlap
between the wives.

188
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,481
If the UnSub is
a cuckolded husband,

189
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,350
I figured that's the place
to start, but so far, nothing.

190
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,952
How about a tox screen?

191
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,154
This UnSub said must be
using heavy-duty narcotics.

192
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,461
Still waiting.
But you're right.

193
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,224
If he's performing back surgery,

194
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,293
it's gonna take a lot more
than a bonk on the head.

195
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,427
Where are we with hotels?

196
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,862
Number one was no help.

197
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,497
But number two had the receipts.

198
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,833
So Steve Duncan
didn't pay for the room.

199
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,368
His lady friend did,
Julie Sullivan.

200
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,037
Why does she look familiar?

201
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,072
That's 'cause she's married
to this guy.

202
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,976
Jack Sullivan, City Councilman
for the District of Columbia.

203
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,177
Bring them both in.

204
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,779
The councilman
will stonewall us,

205
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,081
but we might be able
to get something from the wife.

206
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,283
It'd be nice if we could
get some background intel

207
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,452
on the both of them,
but without Penelope...

208
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,020
We don't have time.

209
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,323
Guys, I know
the BAU is different.

210
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,425
I miss Reid.
I miss Simmons.

211
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,360
And we all miss Penelope.

212
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,098
But we're gonna have to
solve this case without them.

213
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,800
Okay, pals,
you're all wonderful,

214
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,969
but these little boxes
are making my brain wobbly.

215
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,270
And I'm sure it's not just me.

216
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,172
So let's pick this up tomorrow,
okay?

217
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,108
<i>Penelope,
I'm still getting a 503</i>

218
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,210
<i>when I use
the automated interface.</i>

219
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,346
Oh, Riley, I feel your pain.

220
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,780
I'll tell you what,

221
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,849
I will e-mail you
my diagnostic checklist.

222
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,293
Still no bueno, give me a call.
Okay?

223
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,461
Except not between
12:00 and 1:00

224
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,820
because that is my picnic time.

225
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,021
Alright?
Bye!

226
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,322
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

227
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,868
Who is this?

228
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,982
Who are you, please?

229
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:57,970
Oh.

230
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,880
Look, I cannot help you.

231
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:12,351
What you're asking me about,
it will destroy my career.

232
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,020
Then help yourself out,
Councilman.

233
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,355
Let's start here.

234
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,057
You tell me where you were
last night.

235
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,458
And if we can back up
your story,

236
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,028
then your private life
stays private.

237
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,864
I was at home waiting.

238
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:26,932
For Julie?

239
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,934
Jack waits for me.

240
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,439
And when I'm with,
you know, other men,

241
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,509
I-I send him videos.

242
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:42,982
Doesn't your husband get jealous
when you do this?

243
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,383
Angry?

244
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,018
No.

245
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,519
It was my idea.

246
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,623
I didn't think she would
like it, but, uh...

247
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,891
I do.

248
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,226
Because when he comes home,

249
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,630
it's like he has to
win me over again.

250
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,131
It's none of my business, okay?

251
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,499
I'm not here to kink-shame you.

252
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,967
But I've got to be honest.

253
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,270
A lot of men have killed
over less.

254
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,604
That's not me.

255
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,172
I'm not a killer.

256
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,674
Can you prove it?

257
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,250
There's one last video Jack got.

258
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,454
I'll have him show it to you.

259
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,323
Is it of you and Steve?

260
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,125
No.

261
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,560
It was from<i> him.</i>
The man you're looking for.

262
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,130
I'm sorry. I know we should have
come forward sooner.

263
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,974
The killer sent you a video?

264
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,551
Wait a minute. Wait, what?
H-How do you know?

265
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,077
Your wife just told me.

266
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,612
We need your phone right now.

267
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,647
I can't.
I-If anyone finds out...

268
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,549
If you don't, we'll arrest you

269
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,117
for withholding
material evidence

270
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,054
in a homicide investigation.

271
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,622
You know what happens then?

272
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,490
Everyone finds out.

273
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,229
You can't be serious.

274
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,698
I'm just the messenger.

275
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,333
But the higher-ups
were very clear.

276
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,668
All costs associated with moving
the shipping container

277
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,670
come out of the BAU's budget.

278
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,006
Director, with all due respect,

279
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,108
this team has done
everything you've asked.

280
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,078
We've done more with less,
we've scrimped, we've saved.

281
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,746
And as section chief,

282
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,748
I am allowed
discretionary spending.

283
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,316
I made that point.

284
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,086
They said you don't have
that much discretion.

285
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,987
I'm sorry, Emily.

286
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,323
We can't win against
the bean counters.

287
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,128
What a crock of shit.

288
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,032
It's like we're being punished
for being good at our job.

289
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,600
Do you know Rebecca Wilson?

290
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,469
At the DOJ?
Yeah. She's a friend.

291
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,571
Want me to have her ask around,
find out what's up?

292
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,373
God, yes, please.

293
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,142
And please tell me we caught
a break with the container.

294
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,677
I wish I could.

295
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,012
We have covered every corner,
swabbed every corpse.

296
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,714
We triple-checked
that foot locker.

297
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,781
Nothing.

298
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,650
Locard can kiss my ass.

299
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,754
Come on.
Nobody's that good.

300
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,322
You want to bet?

301
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,160
He double- and sometimes
triple-reinforced the metal

302
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,495
to prevent leaks.

303
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,597
He wiped down every surface
with bleach

304
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,332
to destroy third-party DNA.

305
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,802
He wanted this place
as airtight as possible.

306
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,370
Safe, secure.

307
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,239
If the bodies were trophies,
like you thought,

308
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,145
he'd want to preserve them
as long as possible.

309
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,409
You know, I-I did think that.

310
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,177
But now I think
they were experiments,

311
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,479
because he never repeated
the same pattern.

312
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,483
I mean, he stabbed that guy,
shot her, strangled him.

313
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,052
And then there's this guy.

314
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,721
What did he do to this guy?

315
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,458
He poured Sicarius spiders
down this victim's throat.

316
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,360
They're an incredibly
poisonous genus

317
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,228
related to the brown recluse.

318
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,506
Some of the lab techs
are starting

319
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,498
to call this UnSub that,
"Sicarius."

320
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,833
I hate spiders.

321
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,370
Yeah.

322
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,806
Okay, looks like JJ and Alvez
had a break in their case,

323
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,309
but they need to talk to
the entire team, including you.

324
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:01,613
<i>You can either live
as a quadriplegic.</i>

325
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,184
<i>Control nothing
from the neck down.</i>

326
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,188
<i>Or I kill you.</i>

327
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,591
<i>So what's your choice?</i>

328
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,566
Paralyzation or death.

329
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,801
Giving Steve Duncan
an impossible choice

330
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,204
only heightens
the UnSub's sadism.

331
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,638
Does he reveal his face?

332
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,875
No, but he does reveal
something else

333
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,411
as he's turning the video off.

334
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,850
Right...

335
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,651
here.

336
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,454
Whoa.
That's another kill kit.

337
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,190
Yeah. We thought these cases
were connected...

338
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,892
The shipping container,
Rory Gilcrest,

339
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,327
our spinal cord guy.

340
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,563
And now we have our smoking gun.

341
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,365
Hmm.

342
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:57,369
Dave, what are you thinking?

343
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,871
All my years as a profiler,

344
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:02,374
I studied killers
under all kinds of pressure.

345
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,911
But I never studied what
a pandemic would do to them.

346
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,313
They couldn't move,
they couldn't hunt.

347
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,682
But that compulsion
would still drive them,

348
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,919
and they would need
some sort of an outlet.

349
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,154
So they started communicating,

350
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,424
helping each other
to become better predators.

351
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,226
We've got two.

352
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,795
And if we follow the bread
crumbs, we'll find our third.

353
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,398
No, no, no. This is
too organized, too connected.

354
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,833
There's more.

355
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,701
We don't know that for sure.

356
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,272
Think about what we do
know about him so far.

357
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,407
He's controlled, disciplined.

358
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,175
He knows how to hide.
Right?

359
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,411
He knows if there's no body,
there's no crime.

360
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,280
But he's a hunter, restless.

361
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,415
Always looking for a better way.

362
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:47,286
So let's apply that behavior
to his followers.

363
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,754
I see what Rossi's saying.

364
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,924
Why would he be content
with just two?

365
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,692
He isn't with the killings.

366
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,263
So these aren't
just connected cases.

367
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,865
This is a network.

368
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,722
I don't understand.

369
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,333
Why can't we tell
Director Bailey what we have?

370
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,901
Because it's not enough.
How can you say that?

371
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,560
This is the biggest case
we've ever had.

372
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,263
O-Okay, so let's just stick
to what we can prove.

373
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,532
We thought the shipping
container ended in 2020

374
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,867
because of the pandemic,
but it didn't.

375
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,637
Instead, the UnSub
gathered followers.

376
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,539
Followers that he's
now activating.

377
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,841
And if that's
what he gets off on,

378
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,410
he might reactivate himself.

379
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,414
Israel Keyes placed kill kits
across the country,

380
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,316
all for his own use.

381
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,319
Emily, we need more resources.
You know that.

382
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,856
I also know that every time
I try to get those resources,

383
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,257
Bailey screws us.

384
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,627
What we need
is a way around him.

385
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,295
Have any ideas?

386
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,663
No.

387
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,033
But she might.

388
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,436
Prentiss, Rossi, this is
Rebecca Wilson with the DOJ.

389
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,271
Hi, Emily.

390
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,773
Agent Rossi, big fan.

391
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,410
Likewise if you can get some
FBI bureaucrats off our back.

392
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,647
I got the download
on Director Bailey.

393
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,751
He climbed the ladder at DOJ
by being an efficiency expert.

394
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,388
Slashes budgets, reduces staff,
takes the credit when he can,

395
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,556
and passes the buck
everywhere else.

396
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,558
Now that he's Deputy Director
for the Bureau,

397
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,461
he sees a path to becoming AG.

398
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,697
So the BAU's
a political football.

399
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,032
More like a chess piece.

400
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,534
Explain something to me
like I'm five.

401
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,569
The unit gets results.

402
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,005
Where others see monsters,
we see patterns.

403
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:51,009
We understand how psychopaths
think and we stop them.

404
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,011
Why fix what's not broken?

405
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,579
I can ask around.

406
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,381
There's nothing on the table.

407
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,750
But there could be something
in the works.

408
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,020
There's always something
in the works.

409
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,789
Thanks, Rebecca.
Yeah.

410
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,996
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding?

411
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,931
Ow. What?

412
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,900
Y-You and her.

413
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,601
You're so a thing.

414
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,737
No!
W-What?

415
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,674
Oh, God.
Is it that obvious?

416
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,576
I mean, the temperature
in the room went up

417
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,812
like 10 degrees
when you two walked in.

418
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:30,515
How long has this been going on?

419
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,784
A couple months.
Cards on the table.

420
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,453
This is not my first time
dating a woman,

421
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
but, oh, man,

422
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,123
it is my first time
being this happy.

423
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,525
Oh, that's good.

424
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,762
Oh, we could use some happiness
around here.

425
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:47,399
Besides, we're gonna give you
so much shit for this.

426
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,567
Ugh.

427
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,687
What is it?

428
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,456
When do I get to go again?

429
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,659
I told you.
Not yet.

430
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,394
That's not fair.
There's someone I want.

431
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,563
Robert, are you disobeying me?

432
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,465
<i>No, of course not.</i>

433
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,702
But why are we stopping now?

434
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,804
It's not a stop.
It's a pause.

435
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,472
Somebody took something of mine.

436
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,474
I need to make sure
that can't happen again.

437
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,477
And then you can go again.

438
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,446
When?

439
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,182
Soon.

440
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,684
I need to do
some shopping first.

441
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,767
Okay, that's 10 rolls
of duct tape,

442
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,804
6 rolls of electrical tape,
10 toggle switches,

443
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,873
4 bags of wire nuts,
wire cutters,

444
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,442
2 small 12-volt batteries.

445
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,444
That'll be $449.49.

446
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,612
Do you take cash?

447
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,117
Sure.

448
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,959
Sorry. Got to make sure
you're not a counterfeiter

449
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,561
or drug dealer.

450
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,029
Definitely not that interesting.

451
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,964
Uh, network security, you know,

452
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,176
making sure people don't get
hacked, that sort of thing.

453
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,003
You need duct tape
for network security?

454
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,873
No, I need duct tape
for a personal project

455
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,145
that engages my mind because
network security is very boring.

456
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,680
Especially during the pandemic.

457
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,582
You'd be shocked
how careless people get

458
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,885
when you give them instructions
over the Internet.

459
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,653
Look where I work.

460
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,488
I can totally believe it.

461
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,561
Hey, you can get that.
It's fine.

462
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,497
Nah. Work.
It's always work.

463
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,799
Don't worry about it.

464
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,868
Did you want to join
our rewards program?

465
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,736
No, I'm good.
You sure?

466
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,105
'Cause, I mean, you get 20% off
and you have a huge order.

467
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,941
I said I'm good!

468
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,510
Um, my bad.

469
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:15,981
Sorry.

470
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,817
Who's that?

471
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,852
Ah, that's Moose.

472
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,153
He's my floof.

473
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,058
You know, network security,
home security,

474
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,860
we work hand in hand.

475
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,163
Security cameras,
motion-sensor lights.

476
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,165
It's all the same.
Nothing beats a dog.

477
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:37,035
Not Moose.
He's a big old goofball.

478
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,171
You don't say?

479
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,040
Mm-hmm.

480
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,543
Well, Tawny,
thank you for everything.

481
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,890
What if who's ever running the
network is as good as Garcia?

482
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,926
You know, our spinal-cord guy

483
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,661
knew the Sullivans'
phone number.

484
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,163
He knew when and where
they were meeting their bulls.

485
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,933
So far, our remote Garcias
have found nothing.

486
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,936
If Sicarius and his followers
are as good at hacking

487
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,939
as they are at murder,
we're in trouble.

488
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,640
Who's Sicarius?

489
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,609
Uh, Tara said that's
what they're naming

490
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,077
the shipping container UnSub.

491
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,613
I'm not gonna name this jag-off.

492
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,282
Fuckhead! Okay?
Call him that.

493
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,084
I want to know how to catch him.

494
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,820
Go about that the same way
we would a terrorist cell

495
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,755
or a Mafia family, right?

496
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,958
One case at a time
and hope that our UnSub

497
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,926
gives us the whole network.

498
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,629
Well, then let's focus
on this case.

499
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,064
Where are we with the profile?

500
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,333
Still nowhere on
the jealous-husband front.

501
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,867
I mean, the guys
that I questioned,

502
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,236
they're all beta males,
nonviolent type.

503
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,771
I'm beginning to think

504
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,215
we're looking in
the wrong suspect pool.

505
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,708
Yeah, I am, too.

506
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,777
Especially after watching
that murder video.

507
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,781
Okay, so sending the husband
homemade porn

508
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,184
is part of the cuckold kink,
right?

509
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,153
The bull gets off
on the power and control.

510
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,855
That's why our profile's off.

511
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,858
If we rebuild the profile
based around the theory

512
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,365
that it's a bull
killing other bulls,

513
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,762
I think we'll get farther.

514
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,263
Do it.

515
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,204
Penelope?

516
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,339
Garcia:
<i>I need to see you.</i>

517
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,108
I don't know what it is.

518
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,044
Just material evidence
in an FBI investigation.

519
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,747
However, 13 additional
encryption links

520
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,148
are embedded in there.

521
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,250
My guess is it's more
coordinates, but mnh.

522
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,853
You should have the me's-who-
are-not-as-good-as-me crack it.

523
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,721
That's kind of suspicious,
don't you think?

524
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,224
I mean, somebody e-mails
this to you on the same day

525
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,794
that we uncover
a serial killer network?

526
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,130
Suspicious, coincidence,
not my department anymore.

527
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,765
Well, maybe it ought to be,

528
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,876
'cause this is the second time
they've pulled you in.

529
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,369
And now somebody
is feeding you clues.

530
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:55,807
We need you to get
to the bottom of this.

531
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,675
Mm.

532
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,944
What?

533
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,945
Nothing.

534
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,147
No.
Hey, hey, hey.

535
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,915
What? No, wait.
You can tell me.

536
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,450
Talk to me.
What?

537
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,021
Have you gone to therapy
since Krystall died?

538
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,332
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

539
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,034
You said I could say it.
Yeah, well, alright.

540
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,435
Well, that's a little judgy,
don't you think?

541
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,394
I am not judgy.
I think that you are.

542
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,164
I'll grieve in my own way.
Thank you very much.

543
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,466
And I wish other people
would respect that.

544
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,101
I do.
I do respect it.

545
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,437
It's just that I've been
going to therapy, okay?

546
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,272
And... And one of the things

547
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,183
that my licensed clinical social
worker, Tristan, helped me see

548
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,818
after they picked their jaw
up off the floor

549
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,844
from learning of all the things
I've survived,

550
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,047
I have been absorbing trauma
since I was really young

551
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,025
and thinking I was some sort
of hero for doing it.

552
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,787
And then I got a job
for 15 years

553
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,065
where even when you do
the right thing,

554
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,957
even when you stop
serial killers,

555
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,892
your body is absorbing
that trauma.

556
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,028
And I'm not a hero
for holding on to it

557
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,963
because trauma
has to be off-loaded.

558
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,033
It has to be transformed,
or your body will destroy you.

559
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:01,306
And Dave, when I look at you...

560
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,142
ever since you found out
about Krystall's diagnosis...

561
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,944
I think it's better
we don't go there.

562
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,278
Right. Okay.

563
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,114
What I mean is, you know
how everybody's life

564
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,415
fell apart during the pandemic

565
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,817
but then there was
a handful of people

566
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,420
that were thriving
from sheltering in place?

567
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,255
I am one of those people.

568
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,923
My resting heart rate
is stellar.

569
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,792
I'm eating even more
phytonutrients.

570
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,228
I-I'm meditating.

571
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,930
You should try that, actually.

572
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,999
I did.
I kept falling asleep.

573
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,343
Me too.
That was happening to me.

574
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,503
You need to... Not the point.

575
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:38,076
My point right now is,
I miss the team every day.

576
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,946
I miss you every day.

577
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,848
But I don't miss the work.

578
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:55,093
Can I give you a hug
so I know we're okay?

579
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,862
I'm gonna take your silence
as consent.

580
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,270
This is how I profile people.

581
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,980
I really am happy for you.

582
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,216
More than that, I'm jealous.

583
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,553
I want what you have.

584
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:26,357
But right now
I've got a job to do.

585
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,359
You got to go catch a bad guy.

586
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,940
Aah! No!
Help!

587
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,315
He took a woman this time?

588
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,559
Are we sure it's the same UnSub?

589
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,185
Yeah.
Michelle Tucker.

590
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,419
Lives in Frederick, Maryland.

591
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,188
Her husband
reported her missing.

592
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,423
Police found her abandoned car
at a Costco.

593
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,325
Not a Wal-Mart,
but close enough.

594
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,527
That's a huge shift
in victimology.

595
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,629
Why change now?

596
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,664
I'm thinking because he had to.

597
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,899
We got the tox screen
results back,

598
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,644
and the drugs that he uses
for the surgeries,

599
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,504
they're paralytics
to immobilize the victim, sure,

600
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,906
but they're typically prescribed

601
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,508
to treat pain
from a back injury.

602
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,477
So if this medication is his,

603
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,479
his condition could tell us
something about him.

604
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,514
There's only so many
200-pound men

605
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,150
a guy with a back injury
can carry around.

606
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,485
So he took Michelle.

607
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,387
Maybe that was
out of convenience,

608
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,956
but we can't rule out
a personal connection.

609
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,493
It's like his kink
got turned inside out.

610
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,161
What do you mean?

611
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:14,666
One side effect of back injuries
is erectile dysfunction.

612
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:18,069
Our fears come out
in our sex lives.

613
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,371
We hate to admit it,
but it's true.

614
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,141
He can't perform anymore.

615
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,276
So he's punishing anyone
who still can.

616
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:30,214
Severing the spinal cord
is his only way to feel virile.

617
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,051
Is the husband on his way in?

618
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,152
Yeah.
Just landed.

619
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,453
Give him our profile.

620
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,290
Somehow he and Michelle
know this guy.

621
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,159
No, no, this can't be happening.

622
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,995
Mr. Tucker,
we're doing everything we can,

623
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,332
but our best hope depends on you
being completely honest here.

624
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,335
Yeah, yeah, whatever you need.

625
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,470
Who was Michelle seeing
last night?

626
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,208
This guy.

627
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,280
Wait a minute.
That's the same number

628
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,482
that sent the video
to the Sullivans.

629
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,518
Gonna do a reverse
image search here.

630
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,093
This is from a sexy
firefighters calendar.

631
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,495
You and Michelle were catfished.

632
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,564
What?

633
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,702
Mr. Tucker, Michelle
was targeted for a reason.

634
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,238
Maybe because you'd seen
this bull before.

635
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,174
A man who recently suffered
a back injury

636
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,710
who can't perform anymore.

637
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,779
Does any of this ring a bell?

638
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,618
Robert Harris.

639
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,720
Okay.

640
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,356
Who is he?

641
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,359
He promised the best sex
Michelle was ever gonna have.

642
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:52,096
But a couple months ago, he got
into a motorcycle accident,

643
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,532
so we found another bull.

644
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,334
Salt in the wound.

645
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,069
Telling him
he's not good enough.

646
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,270
He'd attack that.

647
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,781
Okay, we need everything
you have on him.

648
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,342
Phone number, address,
car, anything. Yeah.

649
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,546
<i>You might
feel intrusive thoughts.</i>

650
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:11,182
<i>That's perfectly natural.</i>

651
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,288
<i>Just observe those thoughts.</i>

652
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,291
<i>Like a twig floating
on a stream.</i>

653
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,102
Yeah, Riley?
How are you?

654
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,403
Riley?

655
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,472
<i>HelperCat 220?</i>

656
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,107
Y-Yes?

657
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,743
<i>Did you decrypt it?</i>

658
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,211
Oh, my God, it's you.

659
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,846
<i>Did you decrypt it?</i>

660
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,714
No.
I mean, yes, but no.

661
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,082
<i>Why not?</i>

662
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,384
Because I gave it to the FBI.

663
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,453
<i>You what?</i>
Gave it to the FBI.

664
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,388
Look, whoever you think I am,
I am not.

665
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,423
<i>Then who are you?
Don't you understand?</i>

666
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,901
<i>You're the only one
who could help me.</i>

667
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,261
<i>Now, because you didn't,
people are gonna die!</i>

668
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,569
H-Hello?

669
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,708
P-Please, I-I don...
I don't know what this is.

670
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,451
Why can't I move?

671
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,190
Do you feel that?
No.

672
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,125
Why are you doing this to me?

673
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,532
Because you need to learn
who's in charge.

674
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,513
Do you need my login or passwo...

675
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,281
Huh.

676
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,549
What?

677
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:32,917
Each link has a different key.

678
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,861
That means each one goes
to a different recipient.

679
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:35,987
13 in all.

680
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,623
Can you crack it?

681
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,691
Can you turn this on, please?

682
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,893
Turn the volume all the way up.

Yeah, Tara?

712
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,762
Something in the kill kit
just went active.

713
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,430
Those are transponders.

714
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,698
This is how the UnSubs

715
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,934
are finding they kill kits
he's burying.

716
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,001
Are you sure?

717
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,104
Yeah, because JJ and Alvez

718
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,673
are heading for one right now.

<i>wanted in association

<i>and the abduction
of Michelle Tucker.</i>

723
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,548
You don't have to do this.

724
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,784
Okay?

725
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,119
Whatever I did, I'm...
I'm sorry.

726
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,802
What?

727
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,603
You broke the rules, Robert.

728
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,573
No, I didn't.

729
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,609
I told you to pause,
and you didn't.

730
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,646
I told you to work
from a secondary location,

731
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:49,847
and you didn't.

732
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,449
And do you know how I know that?

733
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,585
Because of the fucking beeping

734
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,012
that we are both hearing
right now!

735
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,997
I-I didn't do this.
I don't know how that happened.

736
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,599
I do.
You got sloppy.

737
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,968
And now the police
are on their way to you.

738
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,237
And you know what that means.

739
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,209
I-I can't.

740
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:22,146
Well, if you can't, then I will.

741
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,957
Now, let me talk you through it.

742
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,749
Robert Harris killed himself.
Same as Rory Gilcrest.

743
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,885
And just like Rory, nothing
about him profiled as suicidal.

744
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,988
Whoever Sicarius is, he must
have something on these guys.

745
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,324
Or that's the Devil's Bargain
for joining the network.

746
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,726
Kill yourself
before you get caught.

747
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,129
Good for him.
Bad for us.

748
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,064
We just lost our best lead.

749
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,033
It's okay.
We've got others.

750
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,134
We do?

751
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,869
I'll explain.

752
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:55,806
Go interview them first
so they can go home.

753
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,809
Hey, guys.

754
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,316
This is bad.

755
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,756
<i>Bull sharks can live
in both salt and fresh water.</i>

756
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,092
Hi, baby. Come here.
<i>Its diet consists of fish,</i>

757
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:19,163
<i>stingrays, crustaceans.</i>
Hi.

758
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,332
Moose, good boy!

759
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,636
<i>Other small shark species.</i>

760
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:29,807
<i>The bull shark prefers to hunt
by itself in murky waters</i>

761
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,343
<i>so its prey is unable to see it.</i>

762
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,044
<i>It commonly utilizes...</i>

763
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,715
13 signals just went to 12.

764
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,984
11.
What the hell?

765
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,853
We turned them on,
and now someone turned them off,

766
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,089
which means he knows
that we're on to him.

767
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,830
Did I just make things worse?

768
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,064
No.

769
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,700
You did what you always do.

770
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,236
You helped.

771
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,379
Can you stop them without me?

772
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,214
Honestly?

773
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,283
I don't know.

774
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,287
I need a moment.

775
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:45,816
Yeah. This is Mr. Rossi,
Room 1805.

776
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:49,253
I'm gonna be checking out.

777
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,788
Thanks.

778
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,310
You're home.

779
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,046
Yeah.
I didn't want to wake you.

780
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,514
When'd you get in?
Just now.

781
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,017
I missed my connecting.
I'm lucky I got a flight in.

782
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,119
You want me to pour you a cup?
No, I'm good.

783
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,564
I got enough gas in the tank
to make breakfast for the girls.

784
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,557
Then I'll hit the hay.
Wait, are you sure?

785
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,859
Because that would be
a really big help.

786
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:09,927
Yeah, sure I'm sure.

787
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,995
Aww.

788
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,463
Best husband ever.

789
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,474
The boys are out the door,
so I'm gonna head into work.

790
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,246
Uh, yeah.
Thanks.

791
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,517
You doing alright?

792
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:40,023
Do you think our fears
come out in our sex life?

793
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,928
Am I in trouble?

794
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,098
No.

795
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,868
That's good.

796
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,372
I think about
our life sometimes,

797
00:47:55,439 --> 00:48:00,611
and I realize it's crazy
that we ever made it.

798
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:04,181
And now our whole reality
is this giant clock

799
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,517
counting down the seconds
between school drop-off

800
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,186
and... and family dinners and...

801
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,587
Dead bodies.

802
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,257
Yeah, that too.

803
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:17,361
And the truth is,
there isn't enough time.

804
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,198
There never is.

805
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:23,967
And that...

806
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,136
That's my fear.

807
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:29,306
We have full-time jobs
and two kids.

808
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,275
We're doing the best we can.

809
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,623
Maybe.

810
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,026
Maybe we could do better.

811
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,469
If we can't...

812
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:03,106
make date night...

813
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,375
we could always do date morning.

814
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,651
Morning.

815
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,687
Glad you're back.

816
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,722
I never left.

817
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,292
Hello.
How are we doing?

818
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,628
You look great.

819
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,164
Oh, come on.
What?

820
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,133
Is everybody around here
getting laid except me?

821
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,469
Well, I'm not.

822
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,438
Wow.
I'm sorry.

823
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,640
Gallows humor, but it's all
I've got right now.

824
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,576
You know what? I will take
gallows humor over no humor.

825
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,111
What do we have?

826
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,722
Tara's girlfriend needs
to tell us something

827
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,181
about Director Bailey.

828
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,450
Good news or bad news?

829
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,519
Wait, did you say girlfriend?

830
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,725
Hey, can we, uh, close the door?

831
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,499
What I'm about
to tell you is classified.

832
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,569
If anyone finds out this came
from me, I'll be fired.

833
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,170
Understood.

834
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,474
Part of Doug Bailey's skill set

835
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,609
is knowing
where the department's focus is

836
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,479
because funding follows focus.

837
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,414
And as I'm sure you've read,

838
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,416
the FBI considers
domestic terrorism

839
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,419
to be the fastest growing threat
to this country.

840
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,055
There's money
in fast-growing threats.

841
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,290
There's none in serial killers.

842
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,192
He wants to shut down the BAU.

843
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,627
Not shut down.

844
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,464
The proposal I saw
calls for a reorganization.

845
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,534
The unit would be folded
under Domestic Terrorism.

846
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,269
He can bring in new leadership

847
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,205
if he can show that
the current one is wasteful.

848
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,373
But we're not.

849
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,275
You are as of his last budget.

850
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,577
Something about
a shipping container.

851
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,112
Son of a bitch.

852
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,115
He's been setting us up
this whole time.

853
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:53,750
What happens with us?

854
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:58,188
Reassigned.

855
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,423
Replaced.

856
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,226
Retired.

857
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,231
Rebecca, thank you.

858
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,167
I need to speak with the unit,
please.

859
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,240
So is... is this it?

860
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,443
Is it over?

861
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,144
No, it's not over.

862
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,379
We're just getting started.

863
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,723
Yeah, but what moves do we have?

864
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,649
I mean, the guy's
the Deputy Director.

865
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,118
We use his own argument
against him.

866
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,586
He wants domestic terrorism.

867
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,288
We have
a serial-killing network.

868
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,223
That<i> is</i> domestic terrorism.

869
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:37,093
If we catch them,
if we shut down the network,

870
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,196
if we stop Sicarius...

871
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,831
We justify what we do.

872
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,200
Not even Bailey can touch us.

873
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,701
So it's a race.

874
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,170
We've got to get to those
kill kits before the UnSubs.

875
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,306
Yeah, and with no margin
for error.

876
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:50,841
Once Bailey knows
what we're up to,

877
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,176
he'll use any mistakes
against us.

878
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,544
Maybe.

879
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,880
But we have a secret weapon.

880
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,722
Let's get to work.
