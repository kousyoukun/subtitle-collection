101
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,780
这个是在我们的后院。

死因是脊柱断裂。

108
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,100
不是我们经常看到的受害者。

109
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,068
他们通常是UnSubs。
They're usually the UnSubs.

110
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,772
好吧，这两个人被盯上了，有一个非常具体的原因。
Well, these two were targeted for a very specific reason.

111
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,776
他们都有像Tinder、Feeld这样的应用程序。
They both had apps like Tinder, Feeld,

112
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,878
他们的手机上有成人朋友搜索器。
Adult Friend Finder on their phone.

113
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,048
这就是他们为自己的服务做广告的地方，作为公牛。
That is where they advertise their services as bulls.

114
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,584
公牛和种马是一回事吗？
Are bulls the same thing as studs?

115
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,785
接近。
Close.

116
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,154
在被称为 "戴绿帽子 "的怪癖中，妻子对丈夫进行欺骗。
In the kink known as cuckolding,

117
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,690
妻子用公牛欺骗她们的丈夫。

118
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,125
男人喜欢这样。
Men like this.

119
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,627
没有金钱交易。
No money trades hands.

120
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,663
这都是合法的，而且是双方同意的。
It's all legal and consensual.

121
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,565
UnSub可能会因此被烧死。
The UnSub could have been burned by that.

122
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,400
现在他正在进行报复。
Now he's taking his revenge.

123
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,903
还有一个原因，我们必须接手这个案子。
There is another reason why we have to take this case.

124
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,672
我们的上一个UnSub，Rory Gilcrest，
Our last UnSub, Rory Gilcrest,

125
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,675
他在沃尔玛的一个停车场换了车。
he switched cars at a Wal-Mart parking lot.

126
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,912
这个UnSub也做了同样的事情。下到沃尔玛超市。
This UnSub did the same thing. Down to the Wal-Mart.

127
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,414
我们剖析，罗里有一个合作伙伴。
We profiled that Rory had a partner.

128
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,749
但是，我的意思是...
But, I mean...

129
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,584
这是我们的海运集装箱的家伙吗？
Is this our shipping container guy?

130
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:59,919
我跟Tara查过了
I checked with Tara.

131
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,054
集装箱里的尸体都没有

132
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,557
都没有切断脊柱。

133
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,026
是的，这是一个非常特殊的签名。
Yes, this is a very specific signature,

134
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,797
但我们不能无视眼前的事实。
but we can't ignore what's in front of us.

135
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,699
我们上一个案子的细节在这里显示出来。
Details from our last case are showing up here.

136
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,536
那么还有一个我们必须考虑的理论。
Then there's another theory we have to consider.

137
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,504
这个集装箱背后的人
Who's ever behind the shipping container

138
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,706
并非只有一个伙伴。
doesn't have one partner.

139
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,008
他有两个。
He has two.

140
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,013
所以，这里的计划是标准操作程序。
So, the plan here is standard operating procedure.

141
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,648
我们正在处理这些照片。
We are processing the photographs,

142
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,917
但我们的主要重点是完整的DNA分解。
but our main focus is a complete DNA breakdown.

143
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,685
一旦样本被交叉和分型，
Once the samples are crossed and typed,

144
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,489
我们可以识别尸体，然后，手指交叉，我们的UnSub。
we can ID bodies and then, fingers crossed, our UnSub.

145
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,458
Locard的交换原则说，犯罪者在每个犯罪现场都会拿走和留下一些东西。
Locard's Exchange Principle says that a perpetrator

146
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,094
在每个犯罪现场都会带走和留下一些东西。
takes and leaves something at every crime scene.

147
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,864
如果这家伙17年来都在重访这个案子
If this guy revisited this for 17 years,

148
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,033
一定会有他的一部分在那里的
there's gonna be some piece of him in there.

149
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,468
Prentiss? 你做了什么?
Prentiss? What did you do?

150
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,905
贝利局长, 长官, 我不得不把它从华盛顿州转移过来。
Director Bailey, sir, I had to move this from Washington State.

151
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,241
当地人没有必要的资源
The locals didn't have the resources necessary

152
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,642
来全面调查它
to investigate it fully.

153
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,044
我也明白。我喜欢它。
And I get it. I love it.

154
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,779
我喜欢这种热情。
I love the enthusiasm.

155
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,882
但上级不会喜欢这样。
But the brass is not gonna like this.

156
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,151
尸体数量已经上升到24具。
The body count's already gone up to 24,

157
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,652
还没算上尸骨。
not counting the bones.

158
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,120
我想把话说清楚。
I-I want to be clear here.

159
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:13,125
上头不希望BAU来解决这个案子？
The brass doesn't want the BAU solving this case?

160
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,594
没那么简单。
It's not that simple.

161
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,731
让我把它放在旗杆上。
Let me run it up the flagpole.

162
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,666
希望它是值得的。
Just hope it's worth it.

163
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,803
给我接资源管理部的McNamara主任。
Get me Director McNamara in Resource Management.

164
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,574
伙计。你每天都在处理这个问题？
Man. You deal with that every day?

165
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,710
每一天。
Every day.

166
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,546
好像这工作还不够难似的。
As if this job wasn't hard enough.

167
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,773
我希望你仔细听好。
I want you to listen very carefully.

168
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,943
因为你要做一个选择。
Because you have a choice to make.

169
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,111
我将切断你的脊髓。
I'm going to cut your spinal cord.

170
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,580
哦，上帝。
Oh, God.

171
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,785
你可以选择以四肢瘫痪的方式生活。
You can either live as a quadriplegic.

172
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,355
从脖子以下什么都不能控制。
Control nothing from the neck down.

173
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,291
或者我杀了你。
Or I kill you.

174
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,061
那么你的选择是什么？
So what's your choice?

175
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,632
杀了我。
Kill me.

176
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,252
据称，奥斯卡-王尔德写道：
It is claimed that Oscar Wilde wrote,

177
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:30,056
"世界上的一切都与性有关，除了性。
"Everything in the world is about sex, except sex.

178
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,992
性是关于权力的。"
Sex is about power."

179
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,427
除了他没有。
Except he didn't.

180
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,129
没有人知道是谁写的。
Nobody knows who wrote it.

181
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,733
所以我梳理了我们两个受害者的手机。
So I combed through our two victims' cellphones.

182
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,234
还有，呃，这些公牛。
And, uh, these bulls,

183
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,438
他们让很多女人都非常非常开心。
they made a large number of women very, very happy.

184
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,006
你是什么人？ 嫉妒吗？不是。
What're you, jealous? No.

185
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,075
我太尊重婚姻的神圣性了
I respect the sanctity of marriage too much

186
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,277
不敢惹已婚妇女。
to mess with married women.

187
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,712
我在寻找妻子们之间的重叠部分。
I was looking for overlap between the wives.

188
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,481
如果UnSub是一个戴绿帽子的丈夫，
If the UnSub is a cuckolded husband,

189
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,350
我想这就是开始的地方，但到目前为止，什么都没有。
I figured that's the place to start, but so far, nothing.

190
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,952
毒物屏幕怎么样？
How about a tox screen?

191
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,154
这个UnSub说一定是在使用重型麻醉剂。
This UnSub said must be using heavy-duty narcotics.

192
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,461
还在等待。但你是对的。
Still waiting. But you're right.

193
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,224
如果他要做背部手术
If he's performing back surgery,

194
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,293
那就不能只在头上打一拳了
it's gonna take a lot more than a bonk on the head.

195
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,427
酒店的情况如何？
Where are we with hotels?

196
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,862
第一家没有帮助。
Number one was no help.

197
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,497
但二号有收据。
But number two had the receipts.

198
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,833
所以史蒂夫-邓肯没有支付房间的费用。
So Steve Duncan didn't pay for the room.

199
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,368
他的女性朋友付了，朱莉-沙利文。
His lady friend did, Julie Sullivan.

200
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,037
为什么她看起来很眼熟？
Why does she look familiar?

201
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,072
那是因为她嫁给了这个人。
That's 'cause she's married to this guy.

202
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,976
杰克-沙利文，哥伦比亚区的市议员。
Jack Sullivan, City Councilman for the District of Columbia.

203
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,177
把他们两个带进来。
Bring them both in.

204
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,779
那位议员会阻挠我们的。
The councilman will stonewall us,

205
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,081
但我们也许能从他妻子那里得到些什么。
but we might be able to get something from the wife.

206
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,283
如果我们能得到一些关于他们俩的背景资料就好了
It'd be nice if we could get some background intel

207
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,452
但没有佩内洛普...
on the both of them, but without Penelope...

208
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,020
我们没有时间了。
We don't have time.

209
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,323
伙计们，我知道BAU是不同的。
Guys, I know the BAU is different.

210
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,425
我想念Reid 我想Simmons
I miss Reid. I miss Simmons.

211
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,360
我们都想念佩内洛普
And we all miss Penelope.

212
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,098
但我们必须在没有他们的情况下解决这个案子。
But we're gonna have to solve this case without them.

213
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,800
好了，伙计们，你们都很好。
Okay, pals, you're all wonderful,

214
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,969
但这些小盒子却让我的大脑摇摇欲坠。
but these little boxes are making my brain wobbly.

215
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,270
我相信这不仅仅是我的问题。
And I'm sure it's not just me.

216
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,172
所以，我们明天再继续吧，好吗？
So let's pick this up tomorrow, okay?

217
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,108
佩内洛普，当我使用自动界面时，我仍然得到一个503
Penelope, I'm still getting a 503

218
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,210
当我使用自动界面时，我仍然得到503。
when I use the automated interface.

219
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,346
哦，莱利，我明白你的痛苦。
Oh, Riley, I feel your pain.

220
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,780
我告诉你吧。
I'll tell you what,

221
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,849
我会把我的诊断清单发给你。
I will e-mail you my diagnostic checklist.

222
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,293
还是不行，给我打电话。好吗？
Still no bueno, give me a call. Okay?

223
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,461
但不要在12点和1点之间
Except not between 12:00 and 1:00

224
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,820
因为那是我的野餐时间。
because that is my picnic time.

225
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,021
好吗？再见！
Alright? Bye!

226
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,322
再见！
Auf Wiedersehen!

227
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,868
这是谁？
Who is this?

228
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,982
你是谁，请问？
Who are you, please?

229
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:57,970
哦。
Oh.

230
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,880
听着，我不能帮你。
Look, I cannot help you.

231
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:12,351
你问我的事，会毁了我的事业。
What you're asking me about, it will destroy my career.

232
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,020
那就帮帮你自己吧，议员。
Then help yourself out, Councilman.

233
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,355
让我们从这里开始。
Let's start here.

234
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,057
你告诉我你昨天晚上在哪里。
You tell me where you were last night.

235
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,458
如果我们能证明你的故事，
And if we can back up your story,

236
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,028
那么你的私生活就能保持隐私。
then your private life stays private.

237
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,864
我在家里等待。
I was at home waiting.

238
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:26,932
为朱莉？
For Julie?

239
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,934
杰克在等我。
Jack waits for me.

240
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,439
当我和，你知道，其他男人在一起时，
And when I'm with, you know, other men,

241
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,509
我给他发视频。
I-I send him videos.

242
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:42,982
你这样做的时候，你丈夫不会吃醋吗？
Doesn't your husband get jealous when you do this?

243
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,383
生气吗？
Angry?

244
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,018
不会。
No.

245
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,519
这是我的主意。
It was my idea.

246
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,623
我不认为她会喜欢它，但是，呃... ...
I didn't think she would like it, but, uh...

247
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,891
我喜欢。
I do.

248
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,226
因为当他回家的时候，
Because when he comes home,

249
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,630
就像他必须再次赢得我的信任。
it's like he has to win me over again.

250
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,131
这不关我的事，好吗？
It's none of my business, okay?

251
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,499
我不是来让你感到羞愧的。
I'm not here to kink-shame you.

252
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,967
但我得说实话。
But I've got to be honest.

253
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,270
很多人都为小事而杀人。
A lot of men have killed over less.

254
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,604
那不是我。
That's not me.

255
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,172
我不是一个杀手。
I'm not a killer.

256
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,674
你能证明这一点吗？
Can you prove it?

257
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,250
有一个最后的视频，杰克得到了。
There's one last video Jack got.

258
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,454
我会让他给你看的。
I'll have him show it to you.

259
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,323
这是你和史蒂夫的录像吗？
Is it of you and Steve?

260
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,125
不是。
No.

261
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,560
是他给的。你要找的那个人。
It was from him. The man you're looking for.

262
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,130
我很抱歉。我知道我们应该早点站出来。
I'm sorry. I know we should have come forward sooner.

263
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,974
凶手给你发了一个视频？
The killer sent you a video?

264
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,551
等一下。等等，什么？你怎么知道的？
Wait a minute. Wait, what? H-How do you know?

265
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,077
你的妻子刚刚告诉我。
Your wife just told me.

266
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,612
我们需要你的手机，现在。
We need your phone right now.

267
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,647
我没办法。如果有人发现了...
I can't. I-If anyone finds out...

268
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,549
如果你不说，我们会逮捕你
If you don't, we'll arrest you

269
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,117
隐瞒重要证据的罪名
for withholding material evidence

270
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,054
在谋杀案调查中隐瞒重要证据。
in a homicide investigation.

271
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,622
你知道那时会发生什么吗？
You know what happens then?

272
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,490
每个人都会发现的。
Everyone finds out.

273
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,229
你不会是认真的吧。
You can't be serious.

274
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,698
我只是个传话人。
I'm just the messenger.

275
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,333
但上级领导说得很清楚。
But the higher-ups were very clear.

276
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,668
所有与移动集装箱有关的费用
All costs associated with moving the shipping container

277
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,670
从BAU的预算中支出。
come out of the BAU's budget.

278
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,006
主任，恕我直言，
Director, with all due respect,

279
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,108
这个团队已经完成了你所要求的一切。
this team has done everything you've asked.

280
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,078
我们少花钱多办事，我们节衣缩食，我们节省了。
We've done more with less, we've scrimped, we've saved.

281
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,746
而且作为科长
And as section chief,

282
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,748
我被允许自由支配的开支。
I am allowed discretionary spending.

283
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,316
我提出了这个观点。
I made that point.

284
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,086
他们说你没有那么多自由裁量权。
They said you don't have that much discretion.

285
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,987
我很抱歉，艾米丽。
I'm sorry, Emily.

286
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,323
我们不可能赢过豆类计算员的。
We can't win against the bean counters.

287
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,128
真是一派胡言。
What a crock of shit.

288
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,032
这就像我们正在被惩罚，因为我们的工作做得好。
It's like we're being punished for being good at our job.

289
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,600
你认识Rebecca Wilson吗？
Do you know Rebecca Wilson?

290
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,469
在DOJ？认识。她是我的朋友。
At the DOJ? Yeah. She's a friend.

291
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,571
要不要我让她去打听一下，看看有什么事？
Want me to have her ask around, find out what's up?

292
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,373
上帝，是的，请。
God, yes, please.

293
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,142
请告诉我，我们在集装箱方面获得了突破。
And please tell me we caught a break with the container.

294
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,677
我希望我可以。
I wish I could.

295
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,012
我们已经覆盖了每一个角落，对每一具尸体进行了拭擦。
We have covered every corner, swabbed every corpse.

296
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,714
我们三番五次地检查了那个鞋柜。
We triple-checked that foot locker.

297
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,781
什么都没有。
Nothing.

298
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,650
洛克德可以吻我的屁股。
Locard can kiss my ass.

299
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,754
来吧。没有人是那么好的。
Come on. Nobody's that good.

300
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,322
你想打赌吗？
You want to bet?

301
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,160
他在金属上做了两次，有时甚至三次加固
He double- and sometimes triple-reinforced the metal

302
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,495
以防止渗漏。
to prevent leaks.

303
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,597
他用漂白剂擦拭了每个表面
He wiped down every surface with bleach

304
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,332
以破坏第三方的DNA。
to destroy third-party DNA.

305
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,802
他希望这个地方尽可能地密不透风。
He wanted this place as airtight as possible.

306
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,370
安全，可靠。
Safe, secure.

307
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,239
如果这些尸体是战利品，就像你想的那样。
If the bodies were trophies, like you thought,

308
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,145
他想尽可能长时间地保存它们。
he'd want to preserve them as long as possible.

309
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,409
你知道，我确实这么想。
You know, I-I did think that.

310
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,177
但现在我认为它们是实验品。
But now I think they were experiments,

311
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,479
因为他从不重复相同的模式。
because he never repeated the same pattern.

312
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,483
我是说，他刺伤了那个人，射杀了她，勒死了他。
I mean, he stabbed that guy, shot her, strangled him.

313
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,052
然后是这个人。
And then there's this guy.

314
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,721
他对这个人做了什么？
What did he do to this guy?

315
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,458
他把Sicarius蜘蛛倒进这个受害者的喉咙。
He poured Sicarius spiders down this victim's throat.

316
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,360
它们是一个令人难以置信的有毒的属种
They're an incredibly poisonous genus

317
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,228
与棕色隐士有关。
related to the brown recluse.

318
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,506
一些实验室的技术人员开始
Some of the lab techs are starting

319
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,498
开始把这只 "不明生物 "叫做 "西卡利斯"。
to call this UnSub that, "Sicarius."

320
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,833
我讨厌蜘蛛。
I hate spiders.

321
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,370
是的。
Yeah.

322
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,806
好吧，看起来像JJ和Alvez有一个突破，在他们的案件，
Okay, looks like JJ and Alvez had a break in their case,

323
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,309
但他们需要和整个团队谈谈，包括你。
but they need to talk to the entire team, including you.

324
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:01,613
你可以选择以四肢瘫痪的方式生活。
You can either live as a quadriplegic.

325
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,184
脖子以下什么都不能控制。
Control nothing from the neck down.

326
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,188
或者我杀了你。
Or I kill you.

327
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,591
那么你的选择是什么？
So what's your choice?

328
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,566
瘫痪或死亡。
Paralyzation or death.

329
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,801
给予史蒂夫-邓肯一个不可能的选择
Giving Steve Duncan an impossible choice

330
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,204
只会加剧UnSub的虐待狂。
only heightens the UnSub's sadism.

331
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,638
他露出了他的脸吗？
Does he reveal his face?

332
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,875
没有，但他确实透露了一些别的东西
No, but he does reveal something else

333
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,411
在他关闭视频的时候。
as he's turning the video off.

334
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,850
对...。
Right...

335
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,651
这里。
here.

336
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,454
哇。这是另一个杀人工具。
Whoa. That's another kill kit.

337
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,190
是的。我们认为这些案件有联系...
Yeah. We thought these cases were connected...

338
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,892
那个集装箱，Rory Gilcrest。
The shipping container, Rory Gilcrest,

339
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,327
脊柱的家伙。
our spinal cord guy.

340
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,563
现在我们有了确凿的证据
And now we have our smoking gun.

341
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,365
嗯。
Hmm.

342
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:57,369
戴夫，你在想什么？
Dave, what are you thinking?

343
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,871
我做了这么多年的侧写员
All my years as a profiler,

344
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:02,374
我研究过各种压力下的杀手。
I studied killers under all kinds of pressure.

345
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,911
但我从未研究过大流行病会对他们造成什么影响。
But I never studied what a pandemic would do to them.

346
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,313
他们不能移动，不能狩猎。
They couldn't move, they couldn't hunt.

347
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,682
但这种强迫性仍会驱使他们。
But that compulsion would still drive them,

348
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,919
而且他们需要某种出口。
and they would need some sort of an outlet.

349
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,154
所以它们开始交流。
So they started communicating,

350
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,424
互相帮助，使之成为更好的捕食者。
helping each other to become better predators.

351
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,226
我们已经有了两个。
We've got two.

352
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,795
如果我们跟着面包屑走，我们会找到第三个。
And if we follow the bread crumbs, we'll find our third.

353
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,398
不，不，不。这太有组织了，太有联系了。
No, no, no. This is too organized, too connected.

354
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,833
还有更多。
There's more.

355
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,701
我们还不确定。
We don't know that for sure.

356
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,272
想想我们到目前为止对他的了解。
Think about what we do know about him so far.

357
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,407
他是有控制的，有纪律的。
He's controlled, disciplined.

358
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,175
他知道如何隐藏。对吗？
He knows how to hide. Right?

359
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,411
他知道如果没有尸体，就没有犯罪。
He knows if there's no body, there's no crime.

360
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,280
但他是个猎人，不安分。
But he's a hunter, restless.

361
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,415
总是在寻找一个更好的方法。
Always looking for a better way.

362
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:47,286
所以让我们把这种行为运用到他的追随者身上。
So let's apply that behavior to his followers.

363
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,754
我明白罗西的意思。
I see what Rossi's saying.

364
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,924
为什么他只满足于两个人？
Why would he be content with just two?

365
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,692
他并不满足于这些杀戮。
He isn't with the killings.

366
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,263
所以这些不只是有联系的案件。
So these aren't just connected cases.

367
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,865
这是个网络。
This is a network.

368
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,722
我不明白
I don't understand.

369
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,333
为什么我们不能告诉贝利局长我们所掌握的情况？
Why can't we tell Director Bailey what we have?

370
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,901
因为这还不够。你怎么能这样说呢？
Because it's not enough. How can you say that?

371
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,560
这是我们有史以来最大的案子了
This is the biggest case we've ever had.

372
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,263
好吧，那么我们就坚持我们能证明的东西。
O-Okay, so let's just stick to what we can prove.

373
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,532
我们认为海运集装箱在2020年结束
We thought the shipping container ended in 2020

374
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,867
因为大流行病，但事实并非如此。
because of the pandemic, but it didn't.

375
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,637
相反，UnSub聚集了追随者。
Instead, the UnSub gathered followers.

376
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,539
他现在正在激活的追随者。
Followers that he's now activating.

377
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,841
如果这就是他的乐趣所在
And if that's what he gets off on,

378
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,410
他可能会重新激活自己。
he might reactivate himself.

379
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,414
伊斯雷尔-凯伊斯在全国各地放置了杀人工具。
Israel Keyes placed kill kits across the country,

380
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,316
都是为他自己所用。
all for his own use.

381
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,319
艾米丽，我们需要更多的资源。你知道这一点。
Emily, we need more resources. You know that.

382
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,856
我也知道，每次我试图获得这些资源时，
I also know that every time I try to get those resources,

383
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,257
贝利就会耍我们。
Bailey screws us.

384
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,627
我们需要的是一个绕过他的方法。
What we need is a way around him.

385
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,295
有什么想法吗？
Have any ideas?

386
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,663
没有。
No.

387
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,033
但她可能有。
But she might.

388
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,436
Prentiss, Rossi, 我是司法部的Rebecca Wilson.
Prentiss, Rossi, this is Rebecca Wilson with the DOJ.

389
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,271
嗨, Emily.
Hi, Emily.

390
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,773
Rossi探员, 我是你的粉丝
Agent Rossi, big fan.

391
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,410
如果你能让一些FBI的官僚们离开我们，也是同样的道理。
Likewise if you can get some FBI bureaucrats off our back.

392
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,647
我拿到了关于Bailey局长的下载。
I got the download on Director Bailey.

393
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,751
他通过成为效率专家在司法部爬上了阶梯。
He climbed the ladder at DOJ by being an efficiency expert.

394
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,388
削减预算，减少人员，有功劳就拿，没功劳就推。
Slashes budgets, reduces staff, takes the credit when he can,

395
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,556
并在其他地方推卸责任。
and passes the buck everywhere else.

396
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,558
现在，他是该局的副局长。
Now that he's Deputy Director for the Bureau,

397
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,461
他看到了一条成为总检察长的道路。
he sees a path to becoming AG.

398
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,697
所以BAU是一个政治足球。
So the BAU's a political football.

399
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,032
更像是一个棋子。
More like a chess piece.

400
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,534
解释给我听，就像我是五岁小孩一样。
Explain something to me like I'm five.

401
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,569
该单位得到的结果。
The unit gets results.

402
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,005
别人看到的是怪物，我们看到的是模式。
Where others see monsters, we see patterns.

403
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:51,009
我们了解精神病患者的思维方式，我们阻止他们。
We understand how psychopaths think and we stop them.

404
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,011
为什么要修复没有损坏的东西？
Why fix what's not broken?

405
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,579
我可以四处打听。
I can ask around.

406
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,381
桌子上没有任何东西。
There's nothing on the table.

407
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,750
但可能有一些事情正在进行中。
But there could be something in the works.

408
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,020
总有一些东西在工作中。
There's always something in the works.

409
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,789
谢谢你，丽贝卡。是啊。
Thanks, Rebecca. Yeah.

410
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,996
你在跟我开玩笑吗？你在开玩笑吗？
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding?

411
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,931
嗷。什么？
Ow. What?

412
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,900
你 -你和她。
Y-You and her.

413
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,601
你们是一对。
You're so a thing.

414
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,737
不！什么？
No! W-What?

415
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,674
哦，天哪。有那么明显吗？
Oh, God. Is it that obvious?

416
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,576
我的意思是，房间里的温度上升了
I mean, the temperature in the room went up

417
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,812
你们两个进来的时候，温度上升了10度。
like 10 degrees when you two walked in.

418
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:30,515
这事发生多久了？
How long has this been going on?

419
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,784
几个月了。桌子上的牌。
A couple months. Cards on the table.

420
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,453
这不是我第一次和一个女人约会。
This is not my first time dating a woman,

421
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
但是，哦，伙计，
but, oh, man,

422
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,123
这是我第一次这么开心。
it is my first time being this happy.

423
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,525
哦，那很好。
Oh, that's good.

424
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,762
哦，我们可以使用一些快乐在这里。
Oh, we could use some happiness around here.

425
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:47,399
此外，我们会给你这么多的狗屎。
Besides, we're gonna give you so much shit for this.

426
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,567
唉。
Ugh.

427
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,687
怎么了？
What is it?

428
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,456
我什么时候能再去？
When do I get to go again?

429
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,659
我告诉过你。还没有。
I told you. Not yet.

430
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,394
这不公平。有一个人是我想要的。
That's not fair. There's someone I want.

431
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,563
罗伯特，你是在违抗我的命令吗？
Robert, are you disobeying me?

432
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,465
不，当然不是。
No, of course not.

433
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,702
但为什么我们现在要停下来？
But why are we stopping now?

434
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,804
这不是一个停止。是暂停。
It's not a stop. It's a pause.

435
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,472
有人拿走了我的东西。
Somebody took something of mine.

436
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,474
我需要确保这不会再发生。
I need to make sure that can't happen again.

437
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,477
然后你就可以再去了。
And then you can go again.

438
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,446
什么时候？
When?

439
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,182
很快。
Soon.

440
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,684
我得先去买点东西。
I need to do some shopping first.

441
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,767
好的，那是10卷胶带。
Okay, that's 10 rolls of duct tape,

442
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,804
6卷电工胶带，10个拨动开关。
6 rolls of electrical tape, 10 toggle switches,

443
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,873
4袋电线螺母，剪线钳。
4 bags of wire nuts, wire cutters,

444
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,442
2个12伏的小电池。
2 small 12-volt batteries.

445
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,444
这将是449.49美元。
That'll be $449.49.

446
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,612
你收现金吗？
Do you take cash?

447
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,117
当然。
Sure.

448
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,959
对不起。必须确保你不是一个造假者
Sorry. Got to make sure you're not a counterfeiter

449
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,561
或毒贩。
or drug dealer.

450
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,029
绝对不是那么有趣。
Definitely not that interesting.

451
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,964
呃，网络安全，你知道，
Uh, network security, you know,

452
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,176
确保人们不被黑客攻击，诸如此类的事情。
making sure people don't get hacked, that sort of thing.

453
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,003
你在网络安全方面需要胶带？
You need duct tape for network security?

454
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,873
不，我需要胶带来做一个个人项目
No, I need duct tape for a personal project

455
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,145
因为网络安全是非常无聊的。
that engages my mind because network security is very boring.

456
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,680
特别是在大流行期间。
Especially during the pandemic.

457
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,582
你会震惊于人们的粗心大意。
You'd be shocked how careless people get

458
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,885
当你通过互联网给他们指示时。
when you give them instructions over the Internet.

459
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,653
看看我工作的地方。
Look where I work.

460
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,488
我完全可以相信它。
I can totally believe it.

461
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,561
嘿，你可以得到这个。这很好。
Hey, you can get that. It's fine.

462
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,497
不。工作。它总是工作。
Nah. Work. It's always work.

463
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,799
不用担心。
Don't worry about it.

464
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,868
你想加入我们的奖励计划吗？
Did you want to join our rewards program?

465
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,736
不，我很好。你确定？
No, I'm good. You sure?

466
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,105
因为，我的意思是，你得到20％的折扣，你有一个巨大的订单。
'Cause, I mean, you get 20% off and you have a huge order.

467
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,941
我说我很好！
I said I'm good!

468
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,510
嗯，我的错。
Um, my bad.

469
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:15,981
对不起。
Sorry.

470
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,817
那是谁？
Who's that?

471
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,852
啊，那是Moose。
Ah, that's Moose.

472
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,153
他是我的小伙伴。
He's my floof.

473
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,058
你知道，网络安全，家庭安全。
You know, network security, home security,

474
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,860
我们携手并进。
we work hand in hand.

475
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,163
安全摄像机，运动感应灯。
Security cameras, motion-sensor lights.

476
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,165
这都是一样的。没有什么能胜过一条狗。
It's all the same. Nothing beats a dog.

477
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:37,035
麋鹿不是。他是一个大的老笨蛋。
Not Moose. He's a big old goofball.

478
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,171
你不觉得吗？
You don't say?

479
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,040
嗯，嗯。
Mm-hmm.

480
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,543
好吧，托尼，谢谢你做的一切。
Well, Tawny, thank you for everything.

481
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,890
如果有一天谁在管理网络的时候和加西亚一样好呢？
What if who's ever running the network is as good as Garcia?

482
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,926
你知道吗，我们的脊梁骨医生
You know, our spinal-cord guy

483
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,661
知道Sullivans家的電話號碼
knew the Sullivans' phone number.

484
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,163
他知道他们何时何地与他们的公牛见面。
He knew when and where they were meeting their bulls.

485
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,933
到目前为止，我们的远程Garcias没有发现什么。
So far, our remote Garcias have found nothing.

486
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,936
如果Sicarius和他的追随者在黑客方面和谋杀方面一样出色
If Sicarius and his followers are as good at hacking

487
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,939
我们就有麻烦了
as they are at murder, we're in trouble.

488
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,640
谁是Sicarius?
Who's Sicarius?

489
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,609
呃 Tara说他们给那个集装箱命名为
Uh, Tara said that's what they're naming

490
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,077
船运集装箱UnSub
the shipping container UnSub.

491
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,613
我才不会给这个垃圾箱起名字呢
I'm not gonna name this jag-off.

492
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,282
笨蛋! 好吗？就这么叫他。
Fuckhead! Okay? Call him that.

493
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,084
我想知道如何抓住他。
I want to know how to catch him.

494
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,820
就像我们抓捕恐怖组织或黑手党一样
Go about that the same way we would a terrorist cell

495
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,755
或者黑手党家族，对吗？
or a Mafia family, right?

496
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,958
一次一个案子，希望我们的UnSub能给我们整个网络。
One case at a time and hope that our UnSub

497
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,926
希望我们的UnSub能给我们整个网络。
gives us the whole network.

498
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,629
好吧，那么让我们专注于这个案子。
Well, then let's focus on this case.

499
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,064
我们的情况如何？
Where are we with the profile?

500
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,333
在嫉妒的丈夫方面还是没有进展。
Still nowhere on the jealous-husband front.

501
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,867
我的意思是，我询问过的那些人，
I mean, the guys that I questioned,

502
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,236
他们都是beta型男性，非暴力型。
they're all beta males, nonviolent type.

503
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,771
我开始觉得
I'm beginning to think

504
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,215
我们在寻找错误的嫌疑人。
we're looking in the wrong suspect pool.

505
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,708
是的，我也这么认为。
Yeah, I am, too.

506
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,777
特别是在看了那个谋杀视频之后。
Especially after watching that murder video.

507
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,781
好吧，那么给丈夫发送自制的色情制品
Okay, so sending the husband homemade porn

508
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,184
是绿帽子的一部分，对不对？
is part of the cuckold kink, right?

509
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,153
公牛对权力和控制感到兴奋。
The bull gets off on the power and control.

510
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,855
这就是为什么我们的资料被关闭了。
That's why our profile's off.

511
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,858
如果我们在理论的基础上重新建立档案
If we rebuild the profile based around the theory

512
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,365
它是一头公牛杀死其他公牛。
that it's a bull killing other bulls,

513
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,762
我想我们会走得更远。
I think we'll get farther.

514
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,263
做吧。
Do it.

515
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,204
佩内洛普？
Penelope?

516
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,339
我需要见你。
Garcia: I need to see you.

517
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,108
我不知道是什么事。
I don't know what it is.

518
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,044
只是联邦调查局调查中的重要证据。
Just material evidence in an FBI investigation.

519
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,747
然而，还有13个加密链接
However, 13 additional encryption links

520
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,148
嵌入在那里。
are embedded in there.

521
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,250
我猜是更多的坐标，但MNH。
My guess is it's more coordinates, but mnh.

522
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,853
你应该让那些不如我的人去破解它。
You should have the me's-who- are-not-as-good-as-me crack it.

523
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,721
这有点可疑，你不觉得吗？
That's kind of suspicious, don't you think?

524
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,224
我是说，有人在我们发现一个连环杀手网络的同一天给你发了邮件
I mean, somebody e-mails this to you on the same day

525
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,794
我们发现了一个连环杀手网络?
that we uncover a serial killer network?

526
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,130
可疑的，巧合的，不是我的部门了。
Suspicious, coincidence, not my department anymore.

527
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,765
好吧，也许它应该是。
Well, maybe it ought to be,

528
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,876
因为这已经是他们第二次把你拉进来了
'cause this is the second time they've pulled you in.

529
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,369
现在有人在给你提供线索。
And now somebody is feeding you clues.

530
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:55,807
我们需要你把事情查个水落石出。
We need you to get to the bottom of this.

531
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,675
嗯。
Mm.

532
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,944
什么？
What?

533
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,945
没什么。
Nothing.

534
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,147
没有。 嘿，嘿，嘿。
No. Hey, hey, hey.

535
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,915
什么？不，等等。你可以告诉我。
What? No, wait. You can tell me.

536
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,450
跟我说话。什么？
Talk to me. What?

537
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,021
克劳特死后你去治疗了吗？
Have you gone to therapy since Krystall died?

538
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,332
这到底是什么意思？
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

539
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,034
你说我可以说的。是啊，好吧，好吧。
You said I could say it. Yeah, well, alright.

540
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,435
好吧，这有点评判性，你不觉得吗？
Well, that's a little judgy, don't you think?

541
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,394
我没有评判。我认为你是。
I am not judgy. I think that you are.

542
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,164
我将以我自己的方式悲伤。非常感谢你。
I'll grieve in my own way. Thank you very much.

543
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,466
我希望其他人能尊重这一点。
And I wish other people would respect that.

544
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,101
我是这么想的。我确实尊重它。
I do. I do respect it.

545
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,437
只是，我一直在接受治疗，好吗？
It's just that I've been going to therapy, okay?

546
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,272
而且... 而其中一件事
And... And one of the things

547
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,183
我的持牌临床社会工作者崔斯坦帮助我看到
that my licensed clinical social worker, Tristan, helped me see

548
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,818
在他们把下巴从地上捡起来之后
after they picked their jaw up off the floor

549
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,844
从了解到我所经历的所有事情后。
from learning of all the things I've survived,

550
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,047
我从很小的时候就一直在吸收心理创伤
I have been absorbing trauma since I was really young

551
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,025
并认为我是某种英雄的做法。
and thinking I was some sort of hero for doing it.

552
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,787
然后我找了一份工作，做了15年
And then I got a job for 15 years

553
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,065
即使你做了正确的事情，
where even when you do the right thing,

554
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,957
甚至当你阻止连环杀手时，
even when you stop serial killers,

555
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,892
你的身体正在吸收这种创伤。
your body is absorbing that trauma.

556
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,028
我并不是一个坚持不懈的英雄。
And I'm not a hero for holding on to it

557
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,963
因为创伤必须被卸下。
because trauma has to be off-loaded.

558
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,033
它必须被转化，否则你的身体会摧毁你。
It has to be transformed, or your body will destroy you.

559
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:01,306
而戴夫，当我看着你...
And Dave, when I look at you...

560
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,142
自从你发现了克洛特的诊断结果后...
ever since you found out about Krystall's diagnosis...

561
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,944
我想我们最好不要去那里。
I think it's better we don't go there.

562
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,278
好吧 好的。
Right. Okay.

563
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,114
我的意思是，你知道在大流行病期间，每个人的生活如何
What I mean is, you know how everybody's life

564
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,415
在大流行病期间分崩离析
fell apart during the pandemic

565
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,817
但也有少数人
but then there was a handful of people

566
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,420
但却有一小部分人因就地避难而生活得很好？
that were thriving from sheltering in place?

567
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,255
我就是这些人中的一个。
I am one of those people.

568
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,923
我的静息心率很高。
My resting heart rate is stellar.

569
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,792
我正在吃更多的植物营养素。
I'm eating even more phytonutrients.

570
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,228
我在冥想。
I-I'm meditating.

571
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,930
你应该试试，实际上。
You should try that, actually.

572
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,999
我试过。我一直睡着了。
I did. I kept falling asleep.

573
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,343
我也是。那是发生在我身上的事。
Me too. That was happening to me.

574
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,503
你需要... 不是问题的关键。
You need to... Not the point.

575
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:38,076
我现在的重点是，我每天都想念这个团队。
My point right now is, I miss the team every day.

576
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,946
我每天都想念你。
I miss you every day.

577
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,848
但我不想念工作。
But I don't miss the work.

578
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:55,093
我可以给你一个拥抱吗，这样我就知道我们没事了？
Can I give you a hug so I know we're okay?

579
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,862
我把你的沉默当作同意。
I'm gonna take your silence as consent.

580
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,270
这就是我对人的简介。
This is how I profile people.

581
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,980
我真的很为你高兴。
I really am happy for you.

582
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,216
不仅如此，我还很嫉妒。
More than that, I'm jealous.

583
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,553
我想要你拥有的东西。
I want what you have.

584
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:26,357
但现在我有个工作要做。
But right now I've got a job to do.

585
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,359
你得去抓一个坏人。
You got to go catch a bad guy.

586
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,940
啊，不，帮助！
Aah! No! Help!

587
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,315
这次他带走了一个女人？
He took a woman this time?

588
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,559
我们确定是同一个UnSub吗？
Are we sure it's the same UnSub?

589
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,185
是的。米歇尔-塔克。
Yeah. Michelle Tucker.

590
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,419
住在马里兰州的弗雷德里克。
Lives in Frederick, Maryland.

591
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,188
她的丈夫报告说她失踪了。
Her husband reported her missing.

592
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,423
警方在一家好市多发现了她被遗弃的汽车。
Police found her abandoned car at a Costco.

593
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,325
不是沃尔玛，但足够接近。
Not a Wal-Mart, but close enough.

594
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,527
这是受害者研究中的一个巨大转变。
That's a huge shift in victimology.

595
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,629
为什么现在改变？
Why change now?

596
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,664
我想是因为他不得不这样做。
I'm thinking because he had to.

597
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,899
我们得到了毒物筛查的结果。
We got the tox screen results back,

598
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,644
还有他用来做手术的药物。
and the drugs that he uses for the surgeries,

599
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,504
他们是麻痹剂，用来固定受害者的身体，没错。
they're paralytics to immobilize the victim, sure,

600
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,906
但它们通常是用来
but they're typically prescribed

601
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,508
但通常是用来治疗背部受伤的疼痛。
to treat pain from a back injury.

602
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,477
因此，如果这种药物是他的。
So if this medication is his,

603
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,479
他的情况可以告诉我们一些关于他的信息。
his condition could tell us something about him.

604
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,514
一个有背伤的人只能携带这么多200磅重的人
There's only so many 200-pound men

605
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,150
一个有背伤的人可以随身携带的东西。
a guy with a back injury can carry around.

606
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,485
所以他服用了米歇尔。
So he took Michelle.

607
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,387
也许那是出于方便。
Maybe that was out of convenience,

608
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,956
但我们不能排除有个人关系。
but we can't rule out a personal connection.

609
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,493
这就像他的癖好被翻了出来。
It's like his kink got turned inside out.

610
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,161
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

611
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:14,666
背部受伤的一个副作用是勃起功能障碍。
One side effect of back injuries is erectile dysfunction.

612
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:18,069
我们的恐惧会在我们的性生活中表现出来。
Our fears come out in our sex lives.

613
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,371
我们不愿意承认，但这是事实。
We hate to admit it, but it's true.

614
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,141
他不能再表演了。
He can't perform anymore.

615
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,276
所以他在惩罚那些仍然可以的人。
So he's punishing anyone who still can.

616
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:30,214
切断脊髓是他感受到阳刚之气的唯一途径。
Severing the spinal cord is his only way to feel virile.

617
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,051
丈夫在来的路上吗？
Is the husband on his way in?

618
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,152
是的。刚刚落地。
Yeah. Just landed.

619
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,453
把我们的资料给他。
Give him our profile.

620
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,290
不知何故，他和米歇尔认识这个人。
Somehow he and Michelle know this guy.

621
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,159
不，不，这不可能发生。
No, no, this can't be happening.

622
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,995
塔克先生，我们已经尽力了。
Mr. Tucker, we're doing everything we can,

623
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,332
但我们最大的希望取决于你在这里完全诚实。
but our best hope depends on you being completely honest here.

624
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,335
是的，是的，无论你需要什么。
Yeah, yeah, whatever you need.

625
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,470
米歇尔昨天晚上和谁在一起？
Who was Michelle seeing last night?

626
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,208
这个人。
This guy.

627
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,280
等一下。那是同一个号码
Wait a minute. That's the same number

628
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,482
发送视频给Sullivans的那个号码。
that sent the video to the Sullivans.

629
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,518
我要在这里做一个反向图片搜索。
Gonna do a reverse image search here.

630
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,093
这是从一个性感的消防员日历。
This is from a sexy firefighters calendar.

631
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,495
你和Michelle被骗了。
You and Michelle were catfished.

632
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,564
什么？
What?

633
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,702
塔克先生，米歇尔被盯上是有原因的。
Mr. Tucker, Michelle was targeted for a reason.

634
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,238
也许是因为你以前见过这头牛。
Maybe because you'd seen this bull before.

635
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,174
一个最近背部受伤的人
A man who recently suffered a back injury

636
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,710
他不能再表演了。
who can't perform anymore.

637
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,779
这有什么印象吗？
Does any of this ring a bell?

638
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,618
罗伯特-哈里斯。
Robert Harris.

639
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,720
好的。
Okay.

640
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,356
他是谁？
Who is he?

641
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,359
他承诺过米歇尔会有最好的性生活。
He promised the best sex Michelle was ever gonna have.

642
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:52,096
但几个月前，他遇到了一场摩托车事故，
But a couple months ago, he got into a motorcycle accident,

643
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,532
所以我们找到了另一个公牛。
so we found another bull.

644
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,334
在伤口上撒盐。
Salt in the wound.

645
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,069
告诉他他还不够好。
Telling him he's not good enough.

646
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,270
他就会攻击这个。
He'd attack that.

647
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,781
好的，我们需要你掌握的关于他的一切信息。
Okay, we need everything you have on him.

648
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,342
电话号码，地址，汽车，任何东西。是的。
Phone number, address, car, anything. Yeah.

649
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,546
你可能会感到侵入性的想法。
You might feel intrusive thoughts.

650
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:11,182
这是很自然的。
That's perfectly natural.

651
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,288
只要观察这些想法。
Just observe those thoughts.

652
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,291
就像一根树枝漂浮在溪流上。
Like a twig floating on a stream.

653
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,102
什么事，莱利？你还好吗？
Yeah, Riley? How are you?

654
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,403
莱利？
Riley?

655
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,472
HelperCat 220？
HelperCat 220?

656
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,107
是的，是的？
Y-Yes?

657
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,743
你解密了吗？
Did you decrypt it?

658
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,211
哦，我的上帝，是你。
Oh, my God, it's you.

659
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,846
你解密了吗？
Did you decrypt it?

660
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,714
没有，我是说，有，但没有。
No. I mean, yes, but no.

661
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,082
为什么没有？
Why not?

662
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,384
因为我把它交给了FBI。
Because I gave it to the FBI.

663
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,453
你说什么？把它给了FBI
You what? Gave it to the FBI.

664
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,388
听着，不管你认为我是谁，我不是。
Look, whoever you think I am, I am not.

665
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,423
那你是谁？你不明白吗？
Then who are you? Don't you understand?

666
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,901
你是唯一能帮助我的人。
You're the only one who could help me.

667
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,261
现在，因为你没有，人们就会死！
Now, because you didn't, people are gonna die!

668
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,569
喂？
H-Hello?

669
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,708
拜托，我不... 我不知道这是什么。
P-Please, I-I don... I don't know what this is.

670
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,451
为什么我不能动？
Why can't I move?

671
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,190
你感觉到了吗？没有。
Do you feel that? No.

672
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,125
你为什么要这样对我？
Why are you doing this to me?

673
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,532
因为你需要了解谁在负责。
Because you need to learn who's in charge.

674
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,513
你需要我的登录名或密码...
Do you need my login or passwo...

675
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,281
嗯。
Huh.

676
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,549
什么？
What?

677
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:32,917
每个链接都有一个不同的密钥。
Each link has a different key.

678
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,861
这意味着每一个人都会有不同的收件人。
That means each one goes to a different recipient.

679
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:35,987
总共13个。
13 in all.

680
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,623
你能破解它吗？
Can you crack it?

681
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,691
请你把这个打开好吗？
Can you turn this on, please?

726
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,802
什么？
What?

727
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,603
你违反了规则，罗伯特。
You broke the rules, Robert.

728
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,573
不，我没有。
No, I didn't.

729
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,609
我让你暂停，你却没有。
I told you to pause, and you didn't.

730
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,646
我让你在第二地点工作，而你没有。
I told you to work from a secondary location,

731
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:49,847
而你没有。

732
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,449
你知道我怎么知道的吗？
And do you know how I know that?

733
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,585
因为那该死的嘟嘟声

734
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,012
我们现在都在听！
that we are both hearing right now!

735
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,997
我，我没有这样做。我不知道那是怎么发生的。
I-I didn't do this. I don't know how that happened.

736
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,599
我知道。你太马虎了。
I do. You got sloppy.

737
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,968
而现在警察正在去找你的路上。
And now the police are on their way to you.

738
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,237
而你知道这意味着什么。
And you know what that means.

739
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,209
我不能。
I-I can't.

740
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:22,146
好吧，如果你不能，那么我会的。
Well, if you can't, then I will.

741
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,957
现在，让我给你讲讲。
Now, let me talk you through it.

742
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,749
罗伯特-哈里斯自杀了。和Rory Gilcrest一样
Robert Harris killed himself. Same as Rory Gilcrest.

743
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,885
就像Rory一样 他没有任何自杀的迹象
And just like Rory, nothing about him profiled as suicidal.

744
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,988
不管Sicarius是谁，他一定有这些人的资料。
Whoever Sicarius is, he must have something on these guys.

745
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,324
或者这就是加入网络的 "魔鬼交易"。
Or that's the Devil's Bargain for joining the network.

746
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,726
在你被抓之前自杀。
Kill yourself before you get caught.

747
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,129
对他有好处 对我们不利
Good for him. Bad for us.

748
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,064
我们刚刚失去了最好的线索
We just lost our best lead.

749
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,033
没关系的。我们还有其他人。
It's okay. We've got others.

750
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,134
我们有吗？
We do?

751
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,869
我来解释。
I'll explain.

752
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:55,806
先去采访他们，这样他们就可以回家了。
Go interview them first so they can go home.

753
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,809
嘿，伙计们。
Hey, guys.

754
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,316
这可不好。
This is bad.

755
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,756
斗牛鲨可以生活在咸水和淡水中。
Bull sharks can live in both salt and fresh water.

756
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,092
嗨，宝贝。到这里来。它的食物包括鱼，
Hi, baby. Come here. Its diet consists of fish,

757
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:19,163
黄貂鱼，甲壳类动物。嗨。
stingrays, crustaceans. Hi.

758
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,332
麋鹿，好孩子!
Moose, good boy!

759
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,636
其他小鲨鱼种类。
Other small shark species.

760
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:29,807
牛头鲨喜欢在阴暗的水域中独自狩猎
The bull shark prefers to hunt by itself in murky waters

761
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,343
这样它的猎物就无法看到它。
so its prey is unable to see it.

762
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,044
它通常利用...
It commonly utilizes...

763
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,715
13个信号刚到12个。
13 signals just went to 12.

764
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,984
11. 搞什么鬼？
11. What the hell?

765
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,853
我们把它们打开了，现在又有人把它们关掉了。
We turned them on, and now someone turned them off,

766
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,089
这意味着他知道我们在盯着他。
which means he knows that we're on to him.

767
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,830
我只是让事情变得更糟了吗？
Did I just make things worse?

768
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,064
没有。
No.

769
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,700
你做了你一直做的事。
You did what you always do.

770
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,236
你帮了忙。
You helped.

771
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,379
没有我，你能阻止他们吗？
Can you stop them without me?

772
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,214
说实话？
Honestly?

773
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,283
我不知道。
I don't know.

774
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,287
我需要点时间。
I need a moment.

775
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:45,816
是的。我是罗西先生，1805室。
Yeah. This is Mr. Rossi, Room 1805.

776
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:49,253
我要去退房了。
I'm gonna be checking out.

777
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,788
谢谢。
Thanks.

778
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,310
你回来了
You're home.

779
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,046
是的，我不想吵醒你。
Yeah. I didn't want to wake you.

780
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,514
你什么时候进来的？刚到。
When'd you get in? Just now.

781
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,017
我错过了转机。我很幸运能搭上飞机。
I missed my connecting. I'm lucky I got a flight in.

782
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,119
你想让我给你倒杯酒吗？不用了，我很好。
You want me to pour you a cup? No, I'm good.

783
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,564
我的油箱里有足够的油，可以给女儿们做早餐。
I got enough gas in the tank to make breakfast for the girls.

784
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,557
然后我就去睡大觉。等等，你确定吗？
Then I'll hit the hay. Wait, are you sure?

785
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,859
因为这将是一个非常大的帮助。
Because that would be a really big help.

786
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:09,927
是的，我确定。
Yeah, sure I'm sure.

787
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,995
哦。
Aww.

788
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,463
有史以来最好的丈夫。
Best husband ever.

789
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,474
孩子们都出门了，所以我要去上班了。
The boys are out the door, so I'm gonna head into work.

790
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,246
呃，好的。谢谢。
Uh, yeah. Thanks.

791
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,517
你还好吗？
You doing alright?

792
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:40,023
你认为我们的恐惧会在我们的性生活中表现出来吗？
Do you think our fears come out in our sex life?

793
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,928
我有麻烦了吗？
Am I in trouble?

794
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,098
没有。
No.

795
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,868
那就好。
That's good.

796
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,372
我有时会想到我们的生活，
I think about our life sometimes,

797
00:47:55,439 --> 00:48:00,611
我意识到，我们能做到这一点是很疯狂的。
and I realize it's crazy that we ever made it.

798
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:04,181
而现在我们的整个现实就是这个巨大的时钟
And now our whole reality is this giant clock

799
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,517
倒数着放学的时间
counting down the seconds between school drop-off

800
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,186
和... ...和家庭晚餐和...
and... and family dinners and...

801
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,587
死尸。
Dead bodies.

802
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,257
是的，那也是。
Yeah, that too.

803
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:17,361
而事实是，时间不够。
And the truth is, there isn't enough time.

804
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,198
从来就没有。
There never is.

805
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:23,967
而这...
And that...

806
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,136
这是我的恐惧。
That's my fear.

807
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:29,306
我们有全职工作和两个孩子。
We have full-time jobs and two kids.

808
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,275
我们正在尽力而为。
We're doing the best we can.

809
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,623
也许吧。
Maybe.

810
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,026
也许我们可以做得更好。
Maybe we could do better.

811
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,469
如果我们不能...
If we can't...

812
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:03,106
做好约会之夜...
make date night...

813
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,375
我们总是可以做约会的早晨。
we could always do date morning.

814
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,651
早晨。
Morning.

815
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,687
很高兴你回来了。
Glad you're back.

816
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,722
我从未离开过。
I never left.

817
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,292
你好。我们怎么样了？
Hello. How are we doing?

818
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,628
你看起来很好。
You look great.

819
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,164
哦，来吧。什么？
Oh, come on. What?

820
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,133
除了我，这里的每个人都在做爱吗？
Is everybody around here getting laid except me?

821
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,469
嗯，我没有。
Well, I'm not.

822
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,438
哇。我很抱歉。
Wow. I'm sorry.

823
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,640
胆小鬼的幽默，但这是我现在唯一的办法。
Gallows humor, but it's all I've got right now.

824
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,576
你知道吗？我愿意接受绞刑架式的幽默，而不是毫无幽默感。
You know what? I will take gallows humor over no humor.

825
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,111
我们有什么？
What do we have?

826
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,722
Tara的女朋友需要告诉我们一些
Tara's girlfriend needs to tell us something

827
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,181
关于Bailey主任的事
about Director Bailey.

828
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,450
好消息还是坏消息？
Good news or bad news?

829
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,519
等等，你说女朋友？
Wait, did you say girlfriend?

830
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,725
嘿，我们能不能，呃，把门关上？
Hey, can we, uh, close the door?

831
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,499
我要告诉你的事是机密。
What I'm about to tell you is classified.

832
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,569
如果有人发现是我说的，我就会被解雇。
If anyone finds out this came from me, I'll be fired.

833
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,170
明白了。
Understood.

834
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,474
道格-贝利的部分技能
Part of Doug Bailey's skill set

835
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,609
就是知道部门的重点是什么
is knowing where the department's focus is

836
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,479
因为资金是由重点组成的。
because funding follows focus.

837
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,414
我相信你已经读过了
And as I'm sure you've read,

838
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,416
联邦调查局认为国内恐怖主义
the FBI considers domestic terrorism

839
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,419
是对这个国家增长最快的威胁。
to be the fastest growing threat to this country.

840
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,055
快速增长的威胁是有钱的。
There's money in fast-growing threats.

841
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,290
连环杀手则没有。
There's none in serial killers.

842
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,192
他想关闭BAU。
He wants to shut down the BAU.

843
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,627
不是关闭。
Not shut down.

844
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,464
我看到的提案要求进行重组。
The proposal I saw calls for a reorganization.

845
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,534
该部门将被并入国内恐怖主义部门。
The unit would be folded under Domestic Terrorism.

846
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,269
他可以引入新的领导层
He can bring in new leadership

847
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,205
如果他能证明目前的领导层是浪费的。
if he can show that the current one is wasteful.

848
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,373
但我们不是。
But we're not.

849
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,275
从他的最后一次预算来看，你是。
You are as of his last budget.

850
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,577
关于一个运输集装箱的事情。
Something about a shipping container.

851
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,112
狗娘养的。
Son of a bitch.

852
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,115
他一直在陷害我们。
He's been setting us up this whole time.

853
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:53,750
我们会怎么样？
What happens with us?

854
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:58,188
重新分配。
Reassigned.

855
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,423
被替换。
Replaced.

856
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,226
退役。
Retired.

857
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,231
丽贝卡，谢谢你。
Rebecca, thank you.

858
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,167
我需要和单位说话，请。
I need to speak with the unit, please.

859
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,240
那么... ... 就这样了吗？
So is... is this it?

860
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,443
结束了吗？
Is it over?

861
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,144
不，还没有结束。
No, it's not over.

862
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,379
我们才刚刚开始。
We're just getting started.

863
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,723
是的，但我们有什么动作？
Yeah, but what moves do we have?

864
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,649
我是说，这家伙是副局长。
I mean, the guy's the Deputy Director.

865
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,118
我们用他自己的说法来反对他。
We use his own argument against him.

866
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,586
他想要国内恐怖主义。
He wants domestic terrorism.

867
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,288
我们有一个连环杀人网络。
We have a serial-killing network.

868
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,223
这就是国内恐怖主义。
That is domestic terrorism.

869
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:37,093
如果我们抓住他们，如果我们关闭这个网络，
If we catch them, if we shut down the network,

870
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,196
如果我们阻止西卡利斯...
if we stop Sicarius...

871
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,831
我们就能证明我们所做的是正确的
We justify what we do.

872
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,200
甚至贝利也不能碰我们。
Not even Bailey can touch us.

873
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,701
所以这是一场比赛。
So it's a race.

874
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,170
我们必须在UnSubs之前拿到那些杀戮工具。
We've got to get to those kill kits before the UnSubs.

875
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,306
是的，而且不允许有任何差错。
Yeah, and with no margin for error.

876
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:50,841
一旦贝利知道我们在做什么，
Once Bailey knows what we're up to,

877
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,176
他就会利用任何错误来对付我们。
he'll use any mistakes against us.

878
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,544
也许吧。
Maybe.

879
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,880
但我们有一个秘密武器。
But we have a secret weapon.

880
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,722
让我们开始工作吧。
Let's get to work.
