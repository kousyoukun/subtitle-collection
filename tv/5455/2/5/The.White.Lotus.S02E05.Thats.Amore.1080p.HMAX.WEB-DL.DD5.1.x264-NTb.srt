1
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:07,920
- Are you gonna come for me?
- Yeah.

2
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,463
Yeah.

3
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,510
Oh, my G... Oh, my God.

4
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,324
Hello?

5
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,126
Hey! The gays invited us to Palermo.

6
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,201
What?

7
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,513
We're gonna go on their yacht.

8
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,247
We're gonna spend two
nights at Quentin's palazzo.

9
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,808
He said he might
even throw me a party.

10
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,477
You're gonna need to
bring some cute things.

11
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,793
Do you have any cute things?

12
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,296
Uh, yeah, yeah.

13
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,007
You sure?

14
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,134
Mm-hmm. Yeah, actually.

15
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,858
We're leaving right
after breakfast, so...

16
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,430
come on, get over here.

17
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,514
Okay.

18
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,140
Bye.

19
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,685
Harper?

20
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,105
What is this?

21
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:35,860
You tell me.

22
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,194
Where did you get it from?

23
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,488
I found it yesterday.

24
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:43,658
Where?

25
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,971
Okay, look, it's
not what you think.

26
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,766
I haven't done anything. Okay?

27
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,853
It wasn't me.

28
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,612
It was him. I swear to God.

29
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,238
Uh...

30
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,122
He had sex on the couch?

31
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,875
- In here?
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,627
With who?

33
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,879
With these...

34
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:41,341
with these Italian girls
that we met at the bar.

35
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,223
They were... you know,
they were hookers.

36
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,851
Yeah.

37
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,521
You met two hookers at the
bar, and brought them back

38
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,981
to our room, and Cameron
had sex with them on the couch?

39
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:00,401
I can't remember 'cause,
like, I was wasted, but...

40
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,403
What were you doing?
Were you just watching?

41
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,173
I was... Honestly, I
was just, like... I mean,

42
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,824
I... I... I was
just sitting there.

43
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,576
I... I... I wa... I... I
was going to bed.

44
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,471
They came in, and
then... I mean, I don't know.

45
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,288
I can't remember. I
was really out of it.

46
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,541
And you didn't do anything
with these hookers?

47
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,709
No. I didn't do
any of the sex stuff.

48
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,504
I mean, one of them,
like, at one point,

49
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,730
one of them tried to kiss me,

50
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,966
but I freaked out, so
nothing happened. I promise.

51
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,178
Okay, look, w...
we took Molly...

52
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,016
I mean, I know that
sounds bad, but...

53
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,452
Yeah, it sounds
really fucking bad.

54
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,019
I was gone for
one fucking night,

55
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,689
and you did Molly with hookers?

56
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,707
- Yeah... But...
- And I come back and find a condom wrapper on the couch?

57
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,127
- What the fuck?
- Yeah, but, look... I swear

58
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,651
to you, I didn't do
anything. Okay?

59
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,071
- I'm not lying.
- You already have lied to me.

60
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,738
No, I have not. When
have I lied to you?

61
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,091
- I haven't lied to you.
- Yes, you have!

62
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,968
- When?
- I gave you every chance yesterday to tell me

63
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,995
what happened, and
you fucking bullshitted me.

64
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,706
Well, I didn't tell
you everything, yeah,

65
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,082
- because...
- To say the least.

66
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,130
He begged me not
to tell anyone, okay?

67
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,278
I don't know. I
guess I was worried

68
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:08,238
that if I told you, then
you would talk to Daphne,

69
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,305
and then it would become

70
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,057
- this whole dumb thing.
- That was your worry?

71
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,685
I'm sorry. I fucked up. Okay?

72
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,228
I should've talked
to you. But...

73
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,901
honestly, I kind of think you
should feel good about this.

74
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,403
I mean, I didn't do anything.

75
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,240
All of that was going... Like,
under those circumstances,

76
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:31,076
- and then I didn't do anything?
- It just...

77
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,286
it sounds insane. But...

78
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,956
okay.

79
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,586
Don't make a bigger deal
out of this than it is. Please.

80
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,588
- Please.
- Okay. Okay.

81
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,048
Okay? I didn't do anything.
I'm not lying to you.

82
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,716
Okay.

83
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,052
You know I don't lie to you.

84
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,555
Okay.

85
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,519
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:08,154
Okay, I'm going to go.

87
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,406
Can I, uh... Can
I see you again?

88
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,242
I, um...

89
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:16,079
I have to hang out with
my family today, but...

90
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,374
I don't know, maybe...
maybe tonight?

91
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,293
Yes. Yes, of course.

92
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,504
Okay. All right.

93
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:28,425
Yeah. That was, um... That
was fun. Yeah. It was cool.

94
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,386
- Yeah, cool.
- Yeah.

95
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,931
Um...

96
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,267
Do you...

97
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,601
do you have my money?

98
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,230
Money?

99
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:46,527
It's 2,000 for overnights. Um...

100
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,613
Uh... I'm sorry, for what?

101
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,365
For me.

102
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,625
I'm sorry, I
thought you knew it.

103
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,253
I... I had no idea.

104
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,131
It's okay.

105
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,427
It's okay, it's um... It's okay.

106
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,571
No, I just... Sorry, I just... I...

107
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,472
I've never done
anything like that...

108
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,975
before. So, I just...
I don't know, I just...

109
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,245
- I didn't... I...
- You didn't know.

110
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,354
- You didn't know.
- I didn't know. Yeah.

111
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,355
It's okay. I had fun.

112
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,484
I like you. You're nice.

113
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,485
You don't have to pay for this.

114
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,573
No. I mean now, I feel bad.

115
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,326
- So...
- It's just,

116
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,995
there is a man who will
ask me for the money

117
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,871
and, uh, he's crazy, you know?

118
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,414
- Um...
- Okay,

119
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,560
I'm gonna go to the... I'll go to
the bank. I'll get the money from...

120
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,227
- the bank, I'll...
- It's okay. It's okay.

121
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,921
Maybe we can
still meet later, or...

122
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,052
You don't want to see
me again. I understand.

123
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,697
- No, no, no. I wanna se...
- I understand.

124
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,139
I wanna see you again.

125
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,515
Sure, I wanna see
you again. For sure.

126
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,602
I do like you.

127
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,020
I like you, too.

128
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,692
- Great.
- Great. Okay.

129
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,152
- So... Yeah.
- Uh...

130
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,697
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

131
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,076
No. It's... It's my fault.

132
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,083
Arrivederci.

133
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,504
See you later. Bye.

134
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,822
You
know, I talked to Billy Offer

135
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,182
last night about getting
the marriage annulled.

136
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,186
How did I not see
the signs, Portia?

137
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,898
Do you think I'm oblivious?

138
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,193
No.

139
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,279
You know, sometimes, I think...

140
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,533
I should've started
that spa for poor women

141
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,785
with that girl from Maui.

142
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,706
You know, 'cause she
was like a real healer.

143
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,085
The real deal. But you know,

144
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:13,173
sometimes I think those
healers are a little witchy.

145
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,591
Hm.

146
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,136
Maybe she put a curse on me.

147
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,229
How was your
night? You have fun?

148
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,654
I need to go the bank. I need,

149
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,134
- um... I need to get some euros.
- Yeah, sure.

150
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,033
I can give you, uh, 200.

151
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,663
I need more than that.

152
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,709
For what?

153
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,336
For whatever. Something. I
don't know. Does it matter?

154
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,754
I need to go to the bank.

155
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,427
What?

156
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,211
Daph's pissed at me.

157
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,794
Yeah, I am.

158
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,174
They had their big
night without us. Uncool.

159
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,551
Yeah, so,

160
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,886
I booked a car, so we
can head out to Etna.

161
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,250
Check out some
of these wineries,

162
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,432
little day-drinking,
little wine-tasting.

163
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,058
Apparently, the wine
has, like, a bunch

164
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,062
- of volcanic minerals in it.
- Yeah. Healthy wine.

165
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,313
So, we can get drunk,
and then tomorrow our skin,

166
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,316
and our hair, and our
nails will be glowing.

167
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,399
What do you guys think?

168
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,804
Huh?

169
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:58,986
E?

170
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:00,739
Yeah, sure.

171
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,700
If it's good with Harper.

172
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,745
Yeah, yeah, why not? Let's
get drunk.

173
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,248
Maybe we can find some
Molly and really rage.

174
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,023
Hmm.

175
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,915
Oh, no.

176
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,629
Scusi!

177
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,645
No.

178
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,610
No.

179
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,614
No.

180
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,183
Hi.

181
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,061
- Hi.
- How are you?

182
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,604
Well.

183
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,192
Uh, have you been
charging stuff to my room?

184
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,822
Oh, not much. Just...
just little food. Yeah.

185
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,823
- Is it a problem?
- No, no. It's not a problem.

186
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,552
You wanna charge a
little food, that's fine.

187
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,578
- Thank you.
- Uh, maybe, in exchange, um,

188
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:13,996
you stay away from my son.

189
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,668
Whatever you do,
please do not say anything

190
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,297
to him about, you know,
you and me. Okay?

191
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,487
Have you been going
in my father's room?

192
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,971
No.

193
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,057
No?

194
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,893
Just one time. But
we took showers.

195
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,520
Do not go in my father's
room. That is not cool.

196
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,147
You wanna hang out here? Uh...

197
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,484
Fine, but we can't create
a situation. Okay? Please.

198
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,071
Okay.

199
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,866
- Buona giornata.
- Buona giornata a te.

200
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,270
- Oh, my God. Hey.
- Hey.

201
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,438
- Hey.
- Oh.

202
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,566
Are you, um... are you leaving?

203
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,193
Uh, we're going to Palermo
for two nights. Yeah.

204
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,822
Um, but then we're
coming back. Yeah.

205
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,866
Hey, I just wanted to say,

206
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,784
I'm sorry for yesterday.

207
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:37,496
I was planning on hanging
out and everything. I just...

208
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,250
you know, couldn't
get away, and...

209
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,335
- So...
- No. Yeah, that's fine. Um.

210
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,463
Yeah, I saw that
you were... busy.

211
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,716
Yeah, I guess...

212
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,302
Busy. And, um, you seemed

213
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,681
like you got a little bit
busy yourself.

214
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,515
Yeah.

215
00:16:58,894 --> 00:16:59,894
Yeah.

216
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,730
Yeah, well.

217
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,528
Seriously, though,
have a... have a nice life.

218
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,321
Yeah, I'll try.

219
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,655
And you too.

220
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,367
- Bye, Portia.
- Yeah.

221
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,855
Ciao.

222
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:47,858
Ciao, Isabella.

223
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,202
Oh. Oh. Grazie.

224
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,702
- Ready, honey?
- Yeah.

225
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,145
Guys.
Guys.

226
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:07,771
- Sorry.
- Oh.

227
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,400
So, we will start
with our Etna Bianco.

228
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,567
Mm.

229
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,944
It is juicy on the palate,
and it has notes of plums,

230
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,364
and prickly pears. Oh.

231
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,574
- Oh.
- Oh. Oh.

232
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,657
A bit more.

233
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,996
- Cheers, party people.
- Cheers.

234
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,998
- Cheers.
- La dolce vita!

235
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,628
Cheers.

236
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,715
What's next?

237
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,931
Mm. Yums.

238
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,768
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

239
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,758
Did you knit your little cap?

240
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,554
He doesn't understand
English. Or Italian half the time.

241
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,347
The boat is beautiful.

242
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,308
But does it go any faster?

243
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:30,438
To mm a so!
Make it go faster!

244
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,357
He's just gonna show
me around downstairs.

245
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,444
Wow. I think your
nephew and Portia

246
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,323
- are really hitting it off.
- Yes.

247
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,157
- Wow.
- I think it's nice for him

248
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,077
to have someone of
his own age to play with.

249
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:48,414
I'm just dying to know.
How did you end up in Sicily?

250
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,084
My father moved
here in about 1982.

251
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,712
- Oh.
- And then when I was about 32,

252
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,047
the silly old sausage died,

253
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,882
leaving me his
rather wonderful villa

254
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,634
and its never-ending upkeep.

255
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,970
- And you love it here, right?
- Oh, yes.

256
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,816
Come on. Let me
show you the bedrooms.

257
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,692
They're very fucking posh.

258
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,368
Hey, Rocco.

259
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,374
Si?

260
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,156
Rocco. Prego.

261
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:36,564
What was your guys' favorite?
I think mine was the Eruzione.

262
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:37,688
I liked the one in

263
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,858
I think that glass. Which
one was that, Cam?

264
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,736
I don't remember,
babe. We'll buy a case.

265
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,445
- Okay.
- I have a question.

266
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,531
Yeah, what's your question?

267
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,786
Have you two ever
slept with the same girl?

268
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,913
- What?
- What?

269
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,582
Just curious.

270
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,542
- Where did that come from?
- Yeah.

271
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,502
In college, come on.

272
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,880
Be honest.

273
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,092
Well, there wasn't exactly
a lot of overlap, you know?

274
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,218
Different dating pools.

275
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,011
Really?

276
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,807
You never invited a girl
over to your dorm room?

277
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,932
Played Naked Twister?

278
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,227
Naked Twister?

279
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,311
Come on. You guys
never had one orgy?

280
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,521
Just tell us!

281
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:19,648
- Yeah, Cam...
- No.

282
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,901
- Did you have orgies?
- No, only in my dreams, honey.

283
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,611
Never a threesome?

284
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,339
- No.
- No, not that I recall.

285
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,715
- Right?
- Cameron would always sleep

286
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,241
with the girls that I liked,
but before I could get to them.

287
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,118
If I ever told him
that I liked a girl,

288
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,954
he would swoop in and have
sex with them within a week.

289
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,208
- Oh.
- Cameron. Rude.

290
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,836
You have a bad case of
something called mimetic desire.

291
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,441
If someone with higher status
than you wants something,

292
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,884
it means it's more likely
that you'll want it, too.

293
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:49,596
You did not have
higher status than me.

294
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,556
Not then, maybe.

295
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,558
I mean, I was smarter than you.

296
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,210
Maybe you thought
that fucking women

297
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,355
I had a connection with
would make you smarter.

298
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,067
You guys ever watch
each other have sex?

299
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,694
- Oh, my God.
- Me and E?

300
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,530
- Yeah.
- Harper, what is with these questions?

301
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,950
I mean, it was college, right?
We didn't have our own room.

302
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:13,118
So, probably.

303
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,246
So, I guess old
habits die hard, huh?

304
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:22,377
Mm. You guys wanna
hit up another winery or what?

305
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,087
Yeah!

306
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,594
Come on, let's go.

307
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,020
Welcome to Palermo.

308
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,606
You've never seen
a freak show like this.

309
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,237
- Hey!
- Hey.

310
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,655
Where have you been?

311
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:53,034
Um, he was just giving
me a tour of the cabin.

312
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:57,704
This whole time?

313
00:24:58,998 --> 00:24:59,999
Mm-hmm.

314
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,461
You two have been
having sex on the boat.

315
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,962
That's what you've been doing.

316
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,131
No.

317
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,215
I'm jealous.

318
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,219
I'm jealous.

319
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,945
What happened to your head?

320
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,174
I banged
it on a corner of a nightstand

321
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,909
looking for the remote.
It's just a little scratch.

322
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,787
I'll feel better
after a martini.

323
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,217
I think I'm gonna
eat lunch at the pool.

324
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,095
Why not with us?

325
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:58,641
Well, that girl's over there.
The girl from last night.

326
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,103
You know, I... I... I don't
know how I feel about you

327
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,230
spending a lot of time
with those girls, Albie.

328
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,231
Why? What's the problem?

329
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,862
I think because they're escorts.

330
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,239
How do you know?

331
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,781
Well, because...

332
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,578
Because what?

333
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:23,415
Because I wasn't born
yesterday, and it's fairly obvious.

334
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,544
So what if they are?

335
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,712
I mean, you'll
sleep with escorts,

336
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,965
- but then you'll judge them?
- Who says I sleep with escorts?

337
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,551
I'm sure you've both
slept with escorts.

338
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,780
Albie, I... I just don't think
your mother would be happy

339
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,806
if she knew I was letting
you run around Sicily

340
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,141
with a couple of escorts.

341
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,559
Mom's not happy
because you cheat on her

342
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,604
with whoever you
can get your hands on.

343
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,981
And it's pretty hypocritical
that you would judge them.

344
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:51,652
I'm not judging them.
I'm just looking out for you.

345
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,195
They probably don't
wanna be escorts.

346
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,784
They're just poor and
victims of a fucked-up system.

347
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,996
Women aren't all saints,
Albie. They're just like us.

348
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,540
Have a good lunch.

349
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,666
Where you going?

350
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,881
Dad, what is the
matter with you?

351
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,423
I... I mean, you almost just...

352
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,928
- Just what?
- You know what.

353
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,763
I'm trying to smooth things
over with Albie and with everyone,

354
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,765
and that would,

355
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,517
you know... that would
really not be good.

356
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,769
I can't be responsible
for everything I say,

357
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,104
I'm concussed.

358
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,314
- I just hit my head.
- Yeah.

359
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,175
Oh, my God. Here, here.

360
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,034
I like it.

361
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,954
What the fuck! You told her?

362
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,332
You left a condom wrapper
on the fucking couch,

363
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,500
and she found it!

364
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,961
- What?
- Yeah!

365
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,255
What was I supposed to
do? She thought it was me.

366
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,483
- Are you sure it doesn't...
- I think she still does.

367
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,174
- Oh, shit.
- No.

368
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,426
How do you miss that?

369
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,971
I don't fucking
know, all right? I...

370
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,013
- Cameron!
- Sorry. I...

371
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,473
Coming.

372
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,946
- Are you okay?
- Wow. Wow. Wow.

373
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,282
Yeah. Strong as an ox.

374
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,784
I'm so sorry about the bag.

375
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,744
- I tried not to over pack.
- Nah, you're all right.

376
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,913
It's not a problem.

377
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,664
You got a fucking
dead body in here?

378
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,084
Oh, my God.

379
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,802
My God.
Are you kidding me?

380
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,346
Look at that pool.

381
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,851
Hey. I mean, these
are some high-end gays.

382
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,230
Oh, it's a good feeling
when you realize

383
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:52,940
that someone has money.

384
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,318
'Cause then you don't have to
worry about them wanting yours.

385
00:28:56,402 --> 00:29:00,740
- Mm. Must be such a relief.
- It is. It is.

386
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,201
God, will you look at this?

387
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,577
Oh, my God. Don't
steal anything.

388
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,913
Come in. Come in.

389
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,663
Oh, my God.

390
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,559
You must have dumped
a fortune into this place.

391
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,666
- Hey.
- You all right?

392
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,478
Oh, yes, a
little one. I was hoping to get

393
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,022
some heritage subsidies
from the government,

394
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:16,814
but they said we had
to open it to the public.

395
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,799
So... that's not going to
happen.

396
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,178
Oh, yeah. You don't
want the public in here.

397
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,055
No. The public are not welcome,

398
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,767
but you are. Come. Sit, sit.

399
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,269
Would you like some
tea, some Moscato?

400
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,438
I would like a
splash of Moscato.

401
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,692
Now...

402
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,237
you know, after hearing
the story of your love life,

403
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,738
we decided you were like

404
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,031
a tragic heroine
in a Puccini opera.

405
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,367
I told you this.

406
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:49,121
Yeah, but...
Is that a compliment?

407
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,207
- Oh, yes.
- It is?

408
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,542
So, we decided
it would be very fitting

409
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,211
while you're here if we
took you to the opera.

410
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,048
And tonight they're going
to show Madame Butterfly,

411
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,008
which will be fantastic.

412
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,676
- Mm.
- Would you like that?

413
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,762
- Hm?
- Hm?

414
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,765
- To the opera!
- All'opera!

415
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,349
The opera? Sounds like a fucking

416
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,660
shit idea. So, I say...

417
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,936
That we... we ditch the gays,

418
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,648
I can show you around
town. Get us in trouble.

419
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,067
What do you reckon?

420
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,403
I reckon that sounds great.

421
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,073
- You takin' the piss outta my accent?
- Yeah, maybe a little.

422
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,909
All right, fuck these lot. Hm.

423
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,959
- Yes, yes. Maybe.
- Oh, yeah.

424
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,461
- Yeah.
- Oh, I, uh,

425
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:39,588
I went to the bank.

426
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:41,757
I have the money.

427
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,720
Did you like last night?

428
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:51,142
- Very much. Very much so.
- Hmm. So did I.

429
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,685
What about tonight?

430
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,607
Yeah, um...

431
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,109
I... I don't mind paying.

432
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:08,617
I just... I would feel weird
being part of some situation.

433
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:12,913
Like, if you're being
exploited by some guy.

434
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,757
Do... do you know... Do
you know what I mean?

435
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,791
Yeah.

436
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:21,672
Yeah, but, I mean, I don't
want money. I like you.

437
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:27,219
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Very much.

438
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,055
Hey!

439
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,618
Isabella?

440
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:40,250
Ciao, buonasera.

441
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,421
Buonasera.

442
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:52,054
Ah. E Rocco?

443
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,222
E, Rocco...

444
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,526
Vai.

445
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,808
Wow.

446
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:41,936
That is absolutely incredible.

447
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:44,939
Wow.

448
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:52,990
Can you believe it?

449
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,284
We're finally free,
just you and me.

450
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,578
- Do you like arancini?
- Arancini. Yeah, totally.

451
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,539
- Nice.
- What is it?

452
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,459
It... Fuck's sake.

453
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,419
- It's like a rice ball.
- Oh!

454
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,921
- Yeah.
- A rice ball!

455
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,672
I love a good rice ball.

456
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,132
Bet you do,

457
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,384
you fuckin' slag.-

458
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,012
Well, the best rice
balls are down here.

459
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,554
They're the best in the world.

460
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,766
You're gonna love 'em!

461
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,947
- I sit here?
- Yes. Look up.

462
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,739
Look up.

463
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,244
Wow.

464
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:45,000
Oh, my gosh.

465
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:48,628
Hey.

466
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,422
Who's the lady?

467
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,550
Is it the Queen of Sicily?

468
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,679
Yes.

469
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:03,893
Psst. Psst.

470
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,501
Here we go.

471
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,809
Hey, uh, I'm gonna hit the
head. I'll see you guys over there.

472
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,293
- Sure.
- Okay.

473
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,925
Just... just a second, okay?

474
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,177
- So sorry.
- Okay.

475
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:24,682
Come on.

476
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,535
You can't be giving me looks
like that in front of my wife.

477
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,061
I don't care. Where is my money?

478
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,313
I know, okay? Just...
just relax, okay?

479
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,166
You're gonna get your
money. I've just been busy.

480
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,900
It's 1,300 euros.

481
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,360
Thirteen hundred...
It's nothing.

482
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,820
Okay? I just need
to go to a bank.

483
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,989
- All right? Just... Relax.
- No. Give me your number.

484
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,282
No!

485
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:44,161
- I want it! I want your number.
- No. Jesus Christ.

486
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,121
I'm here with my
wife. All right? I can't.

487
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:48,456
And I can't be talking to you.

488
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:55,838
- Hey.
- Hey.

489
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,759
- Sorry.
- Um. Who was that?

490
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,510
Um...

491
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,889
He owes me money.

492
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:08,018
- He hired you?
- Yeah.

493
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,478
And he didn't pay you?

494
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:15,025
And, um, Alessio is
asking me for the money.

495
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,278
Threatening me and...

496
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,579
Is there anything I can do?

497
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:33,043
No, no. It's not your
problem. Really.

498
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,797
- Okay.
- Yeah.

499
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,449
You can't really be surprised,

500
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:07,327
- can you?
- By what?

501
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:11,956
Well, that he's running around
with an escort.

502
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:13,083
What do you mean?

503
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,085
You've normalized it for him.

504
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,965
Right, like you
normalized it for me.

505
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:23,092
Oh, I never ran
around with hookers.

506
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:24,969
I don't run around
with hookers either.

507
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:31,059
Dom. Didn't you run around
with that exact hooker?

508
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:35,105
You gave her the key to my room.

509
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,070
You know the reason I am
the way I am is because of you.

510
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,572
You're blaming me

511
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,284
for your situation? That's rich.

512
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,494
Do you think you
were so discrete?

513
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,164
Do you? I mean, how
many nights did I hear Mom

514
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:56,668
cry herself to sleep? Get real.

515
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:59,253
Everybody knew, Dad.

516
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,130
Everybody knew.

517
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:04,300
- Everybody knew.
- We had a great marriage.

518
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:07,096
Oh, my God. You are deluded.

519
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,849
You made her life hell
my entire childhood.

520
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,978
Do you have amnesia?

521
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,021
If I made her life hell,

522
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:19,148
- why'd she stay with me?
- I have no idea.

523
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:23,027
She didn't know any better.
She was a martyr. I don't know.

524
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,695
She loved me.

525
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,824
She was a bitter woman.

526
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,119
And she died a bitter woman,

527
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:33,496
and she knew about
everything you did. Believe me.

528
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,958
You were just too
self-involved to even notice that.

529
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,585
Yeah, and you know what, I...

530
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,922
I don't blame you

531
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,800
for my situation, but
I sure fucking could.

532
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,637
Because you never...

533
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,264
showed me how to love a woman.

534
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,684
You never... showed
me how to be intimate.

535
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,018
You never showed me
how to put others first.

536
00:39:56,103 --> 00:40:01,023
You always put yourself first.
Always. So I did the same thing.

537
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,903
I loved your mother.

538
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,239
And she loved me.

539
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,742
It's not that simple.

540
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,036
Yes, it is.

541
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,061
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

542
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,670
To volcanos, and all
the threesomes of past,

543
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,672
and...
present, and future.

544
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,969
I feel like you sow your
oats when you're young,

545
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:32,054
and then you just, you know,
you get it out of your system.

546
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:33,681
I don't know.

547
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,684
- Not sure it works like that.
- I know, but that's the idea.

548
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,271
Well, it's kinda like
food, you know?

549
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,606
You... gorge yourself
until you're sick.

550
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,610
You swear you'll never
eat another bite, and then...

551
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,695
few days later,
you're hungry again.

552
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,865
So, Harper.

553
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,869
You've grilled me and E
all day. What about you?

554
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,413
What about me?

555
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,208
You ever had a threesome?

556
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,291
Yes.

557
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,418
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

558
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,257
- Maybe.
- Really?

559
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,467
With who?

560
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,094
- Uh, with my friend Paola...
- Mmm, Paola?

561
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:16,432
- Mm-hmm? Oh.
- And this guy Oscar.

562
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,813
This was in San Juan.

563
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,207
Were they your
cousins or something?

564
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,733
Very funny.

565
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,985
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay. How old were you?

566
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,909
Um...

567
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,204
I don't know. I was, um...

568
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,791
I was in college.

569
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,545
Were you a good
girl or a bad girl?

570
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,047
I mean, I wasn't...

571
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,052
I wasn't bad, but I had fun...

572
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,094
in college.

573
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,972
In college?

574
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,306
What, not now?

575
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:59,809
No, I mean it's just hard
to... You know, Ethan...

576
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,561
Ethan loves his porn, you
know? So, it's just hard to compete

577
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:05,231
with "Slutty intern gets triple banged..."

578
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:06,942
"For not listening
to her bosses."

579
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,985
Maybe we should
slow down on the wine.

580
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,068
No, let's not slow down.

581
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:11,506
- Let's keep it going, right?
- Yeah, fuck it.

582
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,532
- Yeah! Why not?
- Right? Why not?

583
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,744
Ah. Camerieri.

584
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,036
Okay.

585
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:22,791
Let's see what you
have. Give it a little twirl. Okay?

586
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,934
Perfecto.

587
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,311
- It's okay?
- What's your name?

588
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,335
Luca.

589
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,378
- Luca.
- Yes.

590
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,106
- My name is Harper.
- Nice to meet you.

591
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,675
Piacere...

592
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,360
Grazie, Valentina.
Grazie Mille! Grazie.

593
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:00,282
Grazie, Valentina.

594
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,536
Grazie!

595
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:07,581
Grazie, grazie!

596
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:14,628
Let's go.

597
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,630
I've never eaten
so fast in my life.

598
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:17,840
Seriously, you were right.

599
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:18,842
That was the...

600
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,204
Best rice ball I've ever had.

601
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,219
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

602
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:23,847
Palermo's amazing. Seriously,

603
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,099
there's, like, so much
going on all the time.

604
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,809
I think there's, like, uh, a
club somewhere around here.

605
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,021
But, it's a bit early.

606
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,023
They don't really get
going until 2:00 A.M. here.

607
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:33,981
Hm.

608
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,483
Hey!

609
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:36,669
Oh, keep walking, keep walking,

610
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,003
keep walking.

611
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,379
- Wait, what?
- Hey!

612
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,114
- Come on, run, run, run!
- What's happening?

613
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,452
Go, go! Get behind
that bin there.

614
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:48,663
Wait, what?
What are we doing?

615
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,081
- Okay, get down. Relax.
- What's that? What...

616
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,894
- You all right?
- Why is he chasing us?

617
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:56,045
All right.

618
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,773
All right, we're good.
We're good, we're good.

619
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,798
Whoo!

620
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,427
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What just happened?

621
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:06,222
Well, I forgot my wallet.

622
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:07,932
- I could've paid.
- Nah.

623
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:10,811
- Yeah.
- Wouldn't ask you to pay. You're a lady!

624
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,605
How'd you run in them
things anyway? I'm impressed.

625
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,398
Ow, yeah. My
feet do really freaking hurt.

626
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:17,817
- Do they?
- Yes.

627
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,921
It's all right, I can lick
'em better later if you want.

628
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,588
- Will you?
- Give 'em a little massage.

629
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,032
- Yeah?
- You like that?

630
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,594
Thank you. Thank you.

631
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,532
Okay. Grazie.

632
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:55,331
Hi.

633
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:56,750
Nice.

634
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,007
- Where'd they go?
- To find cigars.

635
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:05,800
Mm.

636
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,141
You okay?

637
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,820
I think something happened.

638
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,239
When we were in Noto.

639
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:34,244
Like what?

640
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:46,382
I'm sure whatever
happened wasn't a big deal.

641
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:57,101
And if anything ever
did happen, you just...

642
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,481
do what you have to do to
make yourself feel better about it.

643
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:13,326
I have this trainer in the city.

644
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,704
Lawrence. He's so handsome.

645
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:19,916
He has blonde hair and
these, like, big, blue eyes.

646
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,255
He's really funny, too.

647
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:28,173
I spend more time with him
than Cameron sometimes.

648
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,592
'Cause he's so busy at work.

649
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,724
Such a cutie. Wanna see a pic?

650
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,076
This is just a
picture of your kids.

651
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,204
Is it? Whoopsie.

652
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,210
We'll find it later.
Anyway, the point is...

653
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,297
maybe you should get a trainer.

654
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,715
This is the best gelato

655
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,175
- you can have in Taormina.
- Really?

656
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,282
- Yeah.
- In just Taormina?

657
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,577
Um, no, I mean,
in all of Sicily.

658
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,536
- Mm. Well, I would hope so...
- Yeah.

659
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:41,748
Because it took us,
like, an hour to get it, so...

660
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:42,998
Lucia!

661
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,211
Oh, no.

662
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:51,800
I'll be right back. Just...
just stay here, okay?

663
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,259
Okay. Yeah.

664
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,278
Sorry.

665
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,365
Who is that?

666
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,744
Alessio.

667
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:21,663
Is everything okay?

668
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,414
I just don't want
to talk about it.

669
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:25,791
Okay.

670
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,177
Poor Madam Butterfly.

671
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:42,724
Seppuku.

672
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,938
I can relate.

673
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,650
Gore Vidal, who is a friend...

674
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,153
Actually, he used to sleep
in the room you're staying in.

675
00:51:56,697 --> 00:52:01,577
He once said, "I can
understand companionship."

676
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:05,081
I can understand bought
sex in the afternoon.

677
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,251
"But I cannot understand
the love affair."

678
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,215
I'm the same.

679
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,135
You've never been in love?

680
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:19,971
Ever?

681
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:22,806
Once, yes.

682
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,143
Before I got wise.

683
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:28,855
I was young.

684
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:33,483
- Who was he?
- He was an American, actually.

685
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:43,161
I was... restless, and I'd
read too much beat poetry.

686
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:46,246
And I decided to go bumming
around the American West

687
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:49,708
in the hopes of
out-scandalizing my father.

688
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,630
And I met this young
cowboy in Wyoming.

689
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,090
- Hm.
- And I fell absolutely

690
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:58,467
head over heels for him.

691
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,472
And of course, he
was heterosexual

692
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:05,724
and completely uninterested,

693
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,561
which only added to
the torturous pleasure.

694
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:13,815
I'd have done anything for him.

695
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,702
And the amazing thing is
after 30 odd years, I still would.

696
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,708
Well, whatever happened to him?

697
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,336
Well, he got old.

698
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,590
Which, though unforgivable,

699
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:40,635
is not strictly-speaking
his fault.

700
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:45,722
No, no.

701
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:46,932
Other than the cowboy,

702
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:49,309
love's never been
my Achilles heel.

703
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,690
It was always beauty.

704
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,735
Hm. I live for beauty.

705
00:53:58,987 --> 00:54:00,070
I know you do.

706
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,159
I do. Hm.

707
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,871
I'd also die for
beauty. Wouldn't you?

708
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,170
Hm.

709
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,298
A world without beauty...

710
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,387
is not a world I
want to live in.

711
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:26,597
Well...

712
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:32,728
you couldn't ask for a
more beautiful world...

713
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:34,896
than this.

714
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,027
Here's to beauty.

715
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:40,987
To beauty.

716
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,121
- You want a fag?
- Yes.

717
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,501
Oh, that was a wild
night, weren't it?

718
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:58,045
Can't believe you
almost got me arrested.

719
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,672
Thought I gave zero
fucks, but you give, like,

720
00:55:00,757 --> 00:55:02,507
negative fucks.

721
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:04,802
- Is that a problem?
- No.

722
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:09,639
Well, you
ain't seen nothin' yet.

723
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,936
- I'll be back, yeah?
- You're not coming in?

724
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:17,565
Oh, I gotta go do
something for my uncle, but...

725
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:19,692
keep your door unlocked, yeah?

726
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:20,818
'Kay.

727
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,445
Hi, this is Abby.

728
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,738
I can't take your
call right now,

729
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,931
so leave me a message.
