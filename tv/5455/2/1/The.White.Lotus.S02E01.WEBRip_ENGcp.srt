1
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,998
Anyways, I feel like
I can't even go back

2
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:04,958
and get married to him.

3
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,501
Pretend like
we never have to go back

4
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,585
to America.

5
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,671
I think so.

6
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,423
- I know, I think...
- Did you guys just get here?

7
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,425
Yeah, we... we just
in flew this morning.

8
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,680
Oh, I'm so jealous.
We leave in a few hours.

9
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,223
So, did you have a good time?

10
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:24,143
We had the best time.
Have you guys been here before?

11
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,228
No.

12
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,356
The hotel's perfect,
and the staff is excellent.

13
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,776
The food is amazing.

14
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,821
- I've heard.
- And the wine. I mean...

15
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,865
We are so excited.

16
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,285
Italy's just so romantic.
Oh, you're gonna die.

17
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,048
They're gonna have
to drag you out of here.

18
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,872
Oh, I'm sure.

19
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,418
Well, I'm gonna get
in the water one last time.

20
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,253
But...

21
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,130
you guys are gonna
have such an amazing trip.

22
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,923
- Thank you. Nice to meet you.
- Thanks.

23
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,425
- You too.
- Safe travels.

24
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,176
- Thanks. Bye!
- Bye!

25
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,630
Oh, what the fuck was that?

26
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,970
Holy fuck.
Oh, my fucking God.

27
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,265
Holy fucking shit.

28
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:50,146
Help! Help! Help! Help!

29
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,692
Help! Help!

30
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,736
Help!

31
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,120
Valentina.

32
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,541
You must stay behind there.

33
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,301
- Allora!
- Oh.

34
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,552
Mia.

35
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,222
Huh?

36
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,488
Sì!

37
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,464
Signori Di Grasso.

38
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,592
Welcome to the White Lotus.

39
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,219
I am Valentina,
the resort manager.

40
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,054
- Ah.
- How was your boat ride?

41
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,723
It was bellissimo.

42
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,642
I mean, I'm impressed
that you are even here.

43
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,852
Why are you impressed?

44
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,854
It's a long trip
from Los Angeles,

45
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,190
and you are quite old, no?

46
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,776
Anyway, Isabella here
will take you up to the hotel...

47
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,820
and bring you
to your beautiful rooms.

48
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,697
Can I offer you
a glass of Prosecco?

49
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,783
Oh. Thank you, dear.
You're a sight for sore eyes.

50
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,035
Thank you.

51
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,036
- Cheers.
- This way.

52
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,037
- Thank you.
- You like it?

53
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,538
Yeah. Thanks.

54
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,664
Hello, darling.

55
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,207
Oh.

56
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,377
Hey. Welcome to Sicily.

57
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,758
Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan.

58
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,596
You must be
Mr. and Mrs. Spiller?

59
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,515
How was your flight?

60
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,892
- It was fine.
- Yeah.

61
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,810
But they did lose
Cameron's bag in Rome.

62
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:44,232
Oh, never transfer through Rome.
Fiumicino always loses bags.

63
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,316
Oh.

64
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,151
You should have
flown through Munich.

65
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,464
- Thanks for the tip.
- Yeah. Next time.

66
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,739
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

67
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,200
Please, some Italian Prosecco?

68
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,327
- Let's toast, people.
- No, thanks.

69
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,913
- I think I'll just wait.
- Harper... You don't want one?

70
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,581
No. I don't want one.

71
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,768
- They wanna do a toast.
- Can you hold the glass for me?

72
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,168
I haven't eaten in six hours.

73
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,003
- I don't need any more drinks.
- Sorry.

74
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,672
Just hold it.

75
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,800
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

76
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,802
- Cheers. We made it.
- Cheers.

77
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,513
Welcome
to the White Lotus in Sicily.

78
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,681
Mm. Thank you.

79
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,224
If your bag will ever arrive,

80
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,268
- we'll let you know right way.
- Okay.

81
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,644
If you believe in miracles.

82
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,396
Okay, thank you.

83
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,524
You're welcome.
So, you don't like Prosecco?

84
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,651
- No, no, it's fine. Thank you.
- Yeah.

85
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,948
- Okay. Okay. Thank you.
- Okay, careful.

86
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,285
Ah! Ah! Oh.

87
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,619
Mrs. McQuoid-Hunt!

88
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,996
Ooh.

89
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,956
Welcome
to the White Lotus in Sicily.

90
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,710
You guys just really...

91
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,878
Just pull out all the stops.
You really do.

92
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,172
Whenever I stay
at a White Lotus,

93
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,217
I always have
a memorable time. Always.

94
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,303
And you are
in our Blossom Circle.

95
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,596
So, you are
very important to us.

96
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,683
Mm. But I was a Petal,

97
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,728
and I've worked
my way up to Blossom. Yeah.

98
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,773
You know that your husband
is already here?

99
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,442
Good. Because...

100
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,402
he hasn't been responding
to my texts.

101
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,987
Shall we?

102
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,698
Yeah, okay. Okay,
Portia, do you get service here?

103
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,408
Yeah, I think
we both have full service.

104
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,368
Maybe we could take it
to AT&T or something.

105
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,121
Wow.

106
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,540
This hotel is so cool.

107
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, originally,
it was a convent.

108
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,710
Honey, check out this view.

109
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,464
- Whoa. Is that a volcano?
- Mount Etna.

110
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,591
Hey, what is with these
head things?

111
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,093
We keep seeing them everywhere.

112
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,386
Testa di Moro.

113
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,596
- Testa di Moro?
- Yeah. Well, the story is

114
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,475
a Moor came here a long time ago
and seduced a local girl.

115
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,520
But then she found out
that he had a wife

116
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,063
and children back home.

117
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,025
So, because he lied to her,
she cut his head off.

118
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,235
- Oh.
- Jesus.

119
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,004
So if you put one
of those outside of your house,

120
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,071
what are you saying?

121
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,954
If you come into my house,
don't fuck my wife.

122
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,396
It's a warning
to husbands, babe.

123
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,303
Screw around and you'll end up
buried in the garden.

124
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,204
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, before I forget.

125
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,914
I'll show you a special feature.

126
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,749
- Cool.
- If I open this door,

127
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,251
you can connect the two rooms.

128
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,561
- Should I show you?
- Oh! Yeah, cool.

129
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,337
No, no, that's okay.
I doubt we'll use that.

130
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,759
Okay.

131
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,304
I mean, it's possible
at some point. I don't know.

132
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,014
It's good to have
the option, yeah?

133
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,141
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

134
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,809
You never know.

135
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,896
- Guys, we did it!
- Yeah!

136
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,998
Come on! We're finally here!

137
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,417
We've been talking
about this forever.

138
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,043
This is awesome. Oh!
I'm so happy we're here.

139
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,777
- It's gonna be great.
- Yeah.

140
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,861
Yeah, totally.

141
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,217
- Let me show you your rooms.
- Yeah!

142
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,534
Let's go.

143
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,053
You go first. All right, guys.
See you later.

144
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,204
Yeah. See you.

145
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,585
What?

146
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,258
Oh. I should tell you.

147
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,510
Both my parents
were born in Sicily.

148
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,720
- Oh.
- Yeah, they came

149
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,848
to the States as children.
Yeah, so we are Sicilian,

150
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,016
just like you.

151
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,185
Although I'm not from Sicily.
I am from Milan.

152
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,437
Oh, you do have more
of a Northern look.

153
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,608
Beautiful hazel eyes.
Wonderful smile.

154
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,486
- You're very kind.
- You must be very popular.

155
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,364
- All right, Dad.
- Ah.

156
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,118
Anyway, we're here because
we're gonna visit the town

157
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,620
- my grandmother's from.
- Oh!

158
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,998
It's a little town,
uh, Testa dell'Acqua.

159
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,750
Yeah, that sounds very special.

160
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,092
Hopefully, um,
we can find some people there

161
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,719
who can speak English, you know,

162
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,888
maybe help us track down
some distant relatives.

163
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,571
'Cause we definitely
don't speak Italian.

164
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,059
Oh, you should come, Isabella.

165
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,145
You could be our translator.
We need you.

166
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,438
- Dad.
- Hmm?

167
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,357
Leave her alone.
We'll take it from here.

168
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,775
Okay, thank you.

169
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,610
Shall I show you how
to close the curtains?

170
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,237
There's a button
over there on the...

171
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,589
That's okay.
We'll figure it out.

172
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,949
I'd like to know.
Where is this button, Isabella?

173
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,993
Dad! I'm gonna help
you find it, okay?

174
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,080
- Thank you very, very much.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

175
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,873
- Thank you.
- You're very lovely.

176
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,874
Thank you.

177
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,085
They are lucky
to have you working here.

178
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,254
Be our translator...

179
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,633
You slammed the door
in that poor girl's face!

180
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,552
You were harassing her.

181
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,888
- How? I was not.
- You kinda were. And farting.

182
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,099
It's the Prosecco.

183
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,660
Okay. Albie and I
are gonna go to our rooms.

184
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,894
We'll come back for you
in a bit. You gonna be okay?

185
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,396
- Uh...
- Great.

186
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,780
Why did we do this?

187
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:29,785
It's nice, Dad.
It's a nice thing to do.

188
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:32,496
I got a migraine.
I'm gonna go lay down.

189
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,667
Okay. Well, I'm probably
gonna head down to the pool.

190
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,087
Um, and then what time
did you wanna meet up for...

191
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,613
The most ancient art
is 14th century.

192
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,032
- Oh, my God. Really?
- Yeah. Oh.

193
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,784
- Your missing husband is here.
- Oh!

194
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,162
- Oh, ho!
- Hey.

195
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,289
Hi!

196
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,458
- How was the flight? Mm.
- I missed you so much.

197
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:22,838
Hey, uh, yeah, you know
I texted you a bunch of times.

198
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,131
And you never texted me back.

199
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,758
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

200
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,801
We just had a flare-up
at work, it was...

201
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,304
Shall I show
you your room, or...

202
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,514
Oh. Yeah, definitely.

203
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,266
What the hell is she doing here?

204
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,351
What?

205
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,731
Yeah, uh, well, look.

206
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,566
I'm traveling by myself...

207
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,069
You bring your assistant
to a vacation with your husband?

208
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,238
Anything you need,
I'll be there. Okay?

209
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,050
Well, I just don't know
what the big deal is.

210
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,593
I mean, I don't know
why you're so bothered.

211
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,743
Because I said no!

212
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,873
Because it's supposed
to be romantic.

213
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:01,877
Because it's a vacation,
in Sicily, for us.

214
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,045
I mean it's...

215
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,755
I mean,
it's not like she's, like,

216
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,715
gonna be in our bed
and stuff, you know?

217
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,468
- I mean, she has her own room.
- Tanya.

218
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,513
Get rid of her.

219
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,140
All right, I'll get rid of her.
I'll get rid of her. All right?

220
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,725
- All right.
- Put her on a plane.

221
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,772
Hey. Um...

222
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,068
You're gonna have to get lost.

223
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,446
Okay. Yeah.

224
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,825
So, what do you mean?
I'd see you in a week, then?

225
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,160
No, no, no, no.
I want you to stay... stay close,

226
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,579
'cause I might need you.
But just lay low

227
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,207
and... and not come out
of your room. Okay?

228
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,752
I gotta go. I gotta go!

229
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,298
I did it. I did it.

230
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,842
Oh. Hi, Portia.

231
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,344
Do you want a drink?

232
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,637
I'm hungry.

233
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,932
Well, we have these
little... little things here.

234
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,225
I just think it's like,

235
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,519
you sold your company,
you got rich,

236
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,397
and now he's your best friend?
That's just...

237
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,065
Are you taking
that side of the bed?

238
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,900
I always sleep on that side.

239
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,902
Okay. Which is it a big deal?

240
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,988
Yeah, I wanna sleep
on my side of the bed.

241
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,994
Okay.
I'll sleep over there.

242
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,164
Yeah, I think that's better.

243
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,335
Also, they're so
touchy-feely. Right?

244
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,797
Like, do you notice that?
It feels performative.

245
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,508
- Like, who does that?
- Happily married couples?

246
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,261
Couples that have been
married for five years?

247
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,804
No way. It feels fake.

248
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,389
You're so quick to judge people.

249
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,475
Yeah, people that brag
about taking helicopters

250
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,601
to the Hamptons

251
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,728
and being friends
with Jeff Bezos. I mean...

252
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,396
Look, Cameron
is the kinda guy who,

253
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,999
if you can put up
with him for five minutes,

254
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,484
you can put up with him forever.
He is consistent.

255
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,651
A consistent douche?

256
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,988
Yeah. He's crazy, it's funny.

257
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,659
- Was he like that in college?
- Way worse.

258
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,328
Why were you
even friends with him?

259
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,682
We weren't friends,
we were roommates.

260
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,208
And then, you know how it is.

261
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,127
You kind of become friends,
and now we're friends.

262
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,677
At some point,
he is gonna approach you

263
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,554
with some kind
of money-making scheme

264
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,516
or some kind of favor
or something.

265
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,079
There's a reason
they invited us here.

266
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,022
Well, that's my prediction.
So, we'll see.

267
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:29,399
Can you just please
try to make an effort?

268
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,610
Or else this is gonna
be a very awkward week.

269
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,321
When do I ever
make things awkward?

270
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,260
Could you put these...
These are hers.

271
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,079
Just put them on the couch
or the... anywhere. Thank you.

272
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,039
Grazie! Thank you!

273
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,533
Hey!

274
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,923
What?

275
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,634
Well, we got here in one piece.

276
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,135
My dad's not in the best shape

277
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,137
and he's already getting
on my nerves, but...

278
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,556
I'm in the middle
of something, Dom, okay?

279
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,974
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

280
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,809
Um, well...

281
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,562
I was thinking of you. You know?

282
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,273
We planned this together
and I, uh,

283
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,858
just really wish you were here.

284
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,070
Yeah, right.
Okay. Whatever, Dom.

285
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,655
No. Not whatever.

286
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,449
Yes, whatever.
Just fuck off!

287
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,079
Okay. Um,

288
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,247
listen, Cara is not answering
my calls.

289
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,416
Well, she doesn't want
to talk to you, so,

290
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,793
I... I don't know.

291
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,170
Well, you should
encourage her to talk to me.

292
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:58,131
You know what? I'm not
getting involved in that.

293
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,133
But you are getting involved,

294
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,511
or why else would
she be mad at me?

295
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,263
Because of this latest
fucking bullshit, Dom!

296
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:09,434
And everything else over
the last ten fucking years!

297
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,728
Do you really think you
should be telling her all this?

298
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,854
Why not?

299
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,649
I have nothing to be ashamed of!
And I'm honest.

300
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,151
I don't keep fucking secrets
from my family!

301
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,237
You should try it sometime!

302
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,572
Well, Albie's here.
He's not upset.

303
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,449
Yes, he fucking is!

304
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,743
He's just... he just doesn't want
to fight you.

305
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,121
He's a sweet,
sensitive young man.

306
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,373
And I honestly don't know
how it happened.

307
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,125
Sure as hell
didn't get it from you.

308
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,876
Okay. Jesus. Um...

309
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,840
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

310
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,508
And I still love you...

311
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,511
Shut the fuck up, Dom.

312
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,515
Shut up with the fucking
sorrys already, okay? Enough!

313
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,642
Okay.

314
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,395
I'll let you know
how it all goes.

315
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,522
I don't fucking care, Dom!

316
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,441
I've wasted enough of my life.

317
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,027
I don't want you
calling me anymore!

318
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,781
Oh, my God, please.
It's fucking done! Okay?

319
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,534
Leave me alone.
Seriously! Fuck you!

320
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:11,121
Go fuck yourself. You fucking
piece of fucking shit!

321
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:53,497
This is such a fucked situation.
I feel like I've just been stuck

322
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,916
at home, just doom-scrolling
on my phone

323
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:56,917
the last three years,

324
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,877
and I finally get out
of there...

325
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,170
and I'm in Italy,

326
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,464
and she just told me
that I have to stay in my room

327
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,548
the whole time!

328
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,752
They're both fucking psycho.

329
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,968
It's fucked! Like,
the job is a joke!

330
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,013
- Then quit.
- She's a f... She's a mess.

331
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,099
She's a miserable mess.

332
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,017
If I had a half
a billion dollars,

333
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,770
I would not be miserable.
I would be enjoying my life!

334
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:21,691
It's... so unfair,
and I'm so tired.

335
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,610
Oh, don't worry about her.

336
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,112
Just go get some dick.

337
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,824
I know! That's...
I know! That's what I...

338
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,576
That's what I wanted.
I wanna do...

339
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,662
get thrown around
by some hot Italian guy,

340
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,414
and now I'm just gonna be
sitting in my room eating pasta.

341
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,500
The menu's all pasta!
I'm gonna be so bloated.

342
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,545
- This sucks.
- Oh, shit. Portia.

343
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,131
- Portia, I gotta get to work.
- Oh, right. Okay.

344
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,673
Love you.

345
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,342
- Love you. Text you later.
- Bye!

346
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,177
Bye.

347
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,975
Hey, Harper, I just realized.

348
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,899
I know someone
that knows you from law school.

349
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,361
Uh, Kevin Kourepenos.
He actually says hi.

350
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,737
Do you want me to say hi?

351
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,032
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Um, tell him I said hi,

352
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,660
and congrats
on not getting disbarred.

353
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,914
Okay. I'll tell him.

354
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,251
So, you do employment law.
So interesting.

355
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,712
Mm-hmm.
What is that exactly?

356
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,547
Um, we, you know,

357
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,008
we take on clients
that are suing their employers

358
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,802
for discrimination,
sexual harassment,

359
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,138
wrongful termination,
stuff like that.

360
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,223
Amazing.

361
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,975
- What? What is that face?
- No, no, no.

362
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,185
Nothing. Just, um...

363
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,936
We've been dealing

364
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,897
with a bunch
of bogus claims lately.

365
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,773
- I mean, everyone has.
- Ah! Hmm.

366
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,400
I mean, even when they
have zero merit

367
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,777
and they get thrown out
in summary judgment,

368
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,696
you still have to go through
all the depos

369
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,781
and the internal investigations.

370
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,074
It's a total time suck.

371
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,368
Not to mention a huge waste
of money. I mean...

372
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,452
God.

373
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,371
Mm.

374
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,586
Well, they're not all bogus.

375
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,338
- No.
- No! God, no. Fuck.

376
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,464
Of course they're not.

377
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,174
Harper, no,
of course they're not.

378
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,800
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

379
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,884
Sorry.

380
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,928
All good.

381
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,598
I bet you're really tough.

382
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,951
I bet your clients
are really happy

383
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,994
to have you in their corner.

384
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,229
Yeah. God,
wouldn't wanna mess with you.

385
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,856
She's like the star of her firm.
Wins every case.

386
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,274
Of course you are.

387
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,827
Are you okay?

388
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,414
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

389
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,416
I... I just am dealing
with some...

390
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
work stuff.

391
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,212
It's... It's nothing.
It's dumb...

392
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,005
Thank you for asking.

393
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,428
I think I saw you
and your cute grandfather

394
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,552
on the boat on the way in.

395
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,306
- Yeah. I... I saw you, too.
- Yeah.

396
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,976
- I'm Portia.
- Albie.

397
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,435
- Hey. Yeah.
- Hey.

398
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,234
- Where are you from?
- Los Angeles.

399
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,486
- Cool.
- Yeah. What about you?

400
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,904
San Francisco.

401
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,365
I love San Francisco.
It's beautiful.

402
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,868
Yeah. Yeah.

403
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,954
I... I actually spent
a lot of time there

404
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,455
because I went
to a school nearby.

405
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,082
Oh, yeah? What school?

406
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,210
I... went to... Stanford.

407
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,839
Don't be so ashamed.

408
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,259
Wha... I... I'm not, it's just...

409
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,095
I went to Chico State, so...

410
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,305
Oh, cool.

411
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,724
Yeah. "Cool."

412
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,852
Cool.

413
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,148
- Uh, what do you do now?
- Um, for work?

414
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,024
Yeah.

415
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,401
I... I act... I work
for this company

416
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,153
that does urban
planning consulting.

417
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,112
Hmm.

418
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,364
I'm just an intern
at this point, so...

419
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,450
So you can go
on vacation for a week

420
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,494
- and no one gives a shit.
- Basically. Yeah.

421
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,582
Oh. There's your grandfather.

422
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,500
He's truly such an adorable man.

423
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,670
Yeah. He's a lot...

424
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,882
My dad and I brought him here
because we're Sicilian...

425
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,675
Or we have Sicilian heritage.

426
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,719
Um, our last name's Di Grasso.

427
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,681
And we're taking him
to the town where his, um,

428
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,850
grandmother was born.

429
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,396
Cool. That's... so nice.

430
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,939
Oh, my God!

431
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,316
Your grandfather just fell!

432
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,193
Oh, no.

433
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,694
- Nonno!
- Nonno, are you okay?

434
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,778
- Huh?
- You okay?

435
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,405
- Yeah, no, no. I'm fine. I...
- Sir?

436
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,740
I tripped.

437
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,343
Did you hit your head or anything?
Oh, my gosh.

438
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,594
- No, no. No, no.
- Your hand, it's...

439
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,536
- It's fine, it's fine.
- Are you okay?

440
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,538
Uh, oh, no, darling, thank you.

441
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,499
- Hello.
- Hi.

442
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,042
Are you... are you sure
you're good?

443
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,919
I mean, I'm so sorry you fell.

444
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,837
Just came to see the view,
I mean...

445
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,231
Yeah, I'll...
I'll walk with you, Nonno.

446
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,295
- There's a good view this way. Come on.
- Huh? Okay.

447
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,717
Oh, my hat.

448
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,927
Oh, I'll get... Yeah. Oh.

449
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,010
Yeah.

450
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:00,929
- Here you go.
- Okay.

451
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,156
Uh, maybe I'll see you around.

452
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,140
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll... I'm just...
- Okay.

453
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,683
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

454
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,327
- Gonna get a drink.
- Who's the girl?

455
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,079
Hi.

456
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,950
Right now?

457
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,253
Hey, where you going?

458
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,255
Oh, don't you want me
to wash up first?

459
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,923
It's hot out!

460
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,550
I got swamp crotch.

461
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,221
Yeah.

462
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,391
God, he's always thinking of me.

463
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,769
Totally disregard
my text about the Ambien.

464
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,855
I have located my Ambien.

465
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,690
- Oh, my gosh! I'm so glad.
- Thank God.

466
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,151
'Cause we don't have any,
so I'm sorry about that.

467
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,487
Oh. Really? You guys
don't take sleeping pills?

468
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,863
No.

469
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,823
- Ever?
- Nope.

470
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,159
- You have trouble sleeping?
- Mm.

471
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,452
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

472
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,037
Why?
Why can't you sleep?

473
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,872
Just, like work stuff?

474
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,460
Yeah, but also just...

475
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,795
I don't know, just
everything that's going on...

476
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,464
in the world.

477
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,051
What do you mean?
What's going on?

478
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,181
Oh, I don't know. Just,
like, the end of the world.

479
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,935
Oh. No, Harper!
Oh, come on!

480
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,621
The world's not ending,
it's not that bad.

481
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,623
Honestly, Cam and I don't even
watch the news anymore.

482
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,523
Yeah.

483
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,358
- You don't follow the news?
- No.

484
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,443
- What?
- Like, I'm just so over

485
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,736
the whole news cycle, you know?

486
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,321
It's... it's like, gimme a break.

487
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,965
They're just trying
to freak everybody out.

488
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,867
Yeah. They're just polarizing
society by making us

489
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,869
glued to their apocalyptic
soap opera, you know?

490
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,330
- It's like...
- Yeah. And even if it was

491
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,706
as bad as they say it is,

492
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,726
- I mean what can you really do, you know?
- Right.

493
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,752
We vote, we donate money.
You can't obsess.

494
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:41,047
- Did you vote, babe? Be honest.
- I did.

495
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,715
Doesn't matter.

496
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,301
I voted. Didn't I?

497
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,888
- I don't think you did.
- I think I did. I did.

498
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,265
I don't know.

499
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,018
Mm. Okay, so you guys
don't watch the news.

500
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,398
Um... What do you do,
like, all day?

501
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,650
Oh. Well, I mean,
I'm... I'm home with the kids.

502
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,860
- I mean, mostly. Yep.
- Oh, right. Of course. Right.

503
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,487
We do a lot of Dateline.

504
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:08,199
I love it.
Husbands murdering their wives.

505
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,451
Happens a lot on vacation.

506
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,078
Scuba diving.

507
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,956
He'll just unplug her oxygen
while she's underwater.

508
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,500
Happens more than you think.

509
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,712
Why... why are you looking at me?

510
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,255
Why are we all looking at you?

511
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,840
Yeah.

512
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,676
Cameron really likes
to watch macho reality TV.

513
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,969
The guys are really ugly.

514
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,472
Oh, my God. That sounds
so bad, but they are.

515
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,016
Honey, the people on Dateline

516
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,475
aren't exactly
attractive either.

517
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,978
At least
they're murdering each other.

518
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,606
What do you watch, Ethan?

519
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,650
Uh, what do we watch?
Like, documentaries.

520
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,655
Ted Lasso, sometimes.

521
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,049
- We love Ted Lasso.
- Love Ted Lasso. Gotta.

522
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,283
- Mm.
- Oh, you like it?

523
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,468
- Yeah, man.
- Yes, of course.

524
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,572
- So likable, right?
- Yeah.

525
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,846
- I don't watch Ted Lasso.
- No?

526
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,080
- Yeah, such a good guy.
- Yeah.

527
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,309
So much content now. It's like
there's billions of shows,

528
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,626
everyone's trying to keep up.

529
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,228
It's kinda suffocating, honestly.
Yeah. Too much.

530
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,521
It's too much.
It's like we're all

531
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,214
entertaining each other
while the world burns, right?

532
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,550
We're all just zombies, you
know, like...

533
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,676
Hmm.

534
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,389
I love a binge.

535
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,601
I don't. Yeah...

536
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,686
Anyway.

537
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,688
Okey dokey. Well...

538
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,607
if I can't get a swim in,

539
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,194
I may as well get a tan, right?

540
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,237
Hey, you know you can
just borrow one of my suits.

541
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,906
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I'd love a swim-in.

542
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,324
- That'd be great.
- Yeah?

543
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,302
Weren't you gonna go up to
get some sunscreen anyway?

544
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,036
- Oh, yeah.
- You could grab it for him.

545
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,913
Oh, yeah. I'll come up
with you actually,

546
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,332
'cause I gotta change
into it anyway.

547
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,085
- Another round of Spritzes, E?
- Sure, I'm on it!

548
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,463
Another round?

549
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,399
Yeah, he likes to order
'em before they're gone.

550
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,557
Yeah.

551
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,563
Yeah.

552
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,900
Yeah.

553
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,288
What are you...

554
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,501
What the fuck?

555
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,962
Oh, my God.

556
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:31,008
I... I... I must have
been disassociating.

557
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,514
I was seeing
all these faces of men

558
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:41,227
with these very
effeminate hairstyles.

559
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,604
And then...

560
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,441
I saw you,

561
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:51,571
and your eyes were
like shark eyes,

562
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,449
like just completely dead.

563
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,159
Just like, dead.

564
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,453
Well, you really know
how to pump a guy up.

565
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,414
Must've been the Bonine
that I took before the flight.

566
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,584
I didn't get to finish.

567
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,336
I need to take a breather.

568
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,850
Making love
In the afternoon with Tanya...

569
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,272
Tanya?

570
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:27,981
Yeah?

571
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,652
You ate all
the macaroons, didn't you?

572
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,613
What macaroons?

573
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,823
How do you expect
to lose weight if you inhale

574
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:40,119
five macaroons
and not even remember?

575
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,959
There were only three.

576
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,045
There were five.

577
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,464
Did you drink
the champagne, too?

578
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,273
I think he put them in here.

579
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,195
Yeah.

580
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,655
- Oh, washing bag?
- Yes.

581
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,366
Hey, uh, listen.

582
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,952
I know we don't know
each other that well,

583
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,538
but I really appreciate you
being here.

584
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,331
You know, it means a lot.

585
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,750
Ethan never really
brought around a lot of girls,

586
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,628
so I'm just so happy
that he found someone.

587
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,879
I think it's great.

588
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,550
Well, thanks for inviting us.

589
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,551
Sure.

590
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,052
- It'll be fun.
- It will be.

591
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:39,720
- I'm gonna get the sunscreen.
- Yeah.

592
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,468
Hey.

593
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,928
- Hey!
- What do you think?

594
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,430
Little snug, right?

595
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,266
I think they're fine.

596
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,642
Yeah? Hmm.

597
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,604
Can't find the sunscreen.

598
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,582
You know what? They probably
have a bunch of that

599
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,815
by the pool.

600
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,692
- I'm gonna keep looking.
- Yeah.

601
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,487
- Hey, I'll see you down there.
- Hmm.

602
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,462
- Hi.
- Hey, um,

603
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,130
Nonno fell by the pool.

604
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,007
- What?
- He's fine. Um,

605
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,637
but I think he hit his head.
He could have a concussion.

606
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,139
I'm thinking someone
should sleep with him tonight.

607
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,308
- Keep an eye on him.
- Yeah. Good idea.

608
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,769
Um...
Uh, we'll put him in your room.

609
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,564
I got work stuff. L.A. will
still be up. I'm gonna be up

610
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,108
and around all night.
So let's just, uh...

611
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,277
We'll put him
in your room. Okay?

612
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,946
Okay.

613
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,322
- Anything else?
- No.

614
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,075
What do you say, dinner at 8:00?

615
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,744
- Yeah. Sure.
- All right.

616
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,334
Hmm.

617
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,067
- Hmm.
- LUCIA:

618
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:45,906
Niente.

619
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,291
Mia.

620
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,023
Non dimenticar

621
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,317
Means don't forget you are

622
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,612
My darling...

623
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,081
- Hmm?
- Mia.

624
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:43,380
No.

625
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,972
Only just tonight dear

626
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,311
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Hunt.

627
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,647
- Ah, Mikael. This is my wife, Tanya.
- Welcome.

628
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,524
Nice to meet you, Mrs.
Tanya. Hi. Hi.

629
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,733
How are you today?

630
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,610
- I heard a lot about you.
- Oh.

631
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,946
Nice to meet you.
How was your day today?

632
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,740
Oh, it was a... it was a...
It was a good day.

633
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,617
One sec. Did you watch
the football today?

634
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,161
No, well, my country has a whole
different kind of football.

635
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,622
I told you to stay in the room.

636
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,040
I had to eat.

637
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,002
Oh, my God.
He's gonna flip the fuck out.

638
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,924
What are you... Shit!
Here. Hold that.

639
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,388
Anyway. Here she is.

640
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,681
Sorry. Shall we go to the table?

641
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,075
- Yeah, why not? Let's eat.
- Please.

642
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,201
Okay. I'll take
you to the table.

643
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,144
- Follow me, please.
- Oh, my God.

644
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:43,190
- Thanks, I love it.
- I got it, I got it.

645
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,905
We just flew
all the way in from Los Angeles.

646
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,326
Just to be here in Sicily.

647
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,997
Because we are Sicilian.
Are you Sicilian?

648
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,042
- Yes, from Catania.
- Ah. Are you married?

649
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,879
Dad, why don't you let her
put our order in

650
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,338
so I can get a drink?

651
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,216
My son is a big muckity-muck
in Hollywood,

652
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,803
- so he's very impatient.
- I'll bring you your drinks.

653
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,388
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Sorry.

654
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,557
Thank you.

655
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,894
- Dad, you gotta knock it off.
- Oh. What's the problem?

656
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,522
What are you doing?
I mean, what's... the point?

657
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,774
Flirting is one
of the pleasures of life.

658
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,735
Do you actually think
you have a chance

659
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,903
with any of these women?

660
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:29,986
Oh, don't be rude.

661
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,031
I'm just saying,
you're 80 years old.

662
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:36,243
Well, I'm still a man.
And I get older and older,

663
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,330
but the women I desire
remain young.

664
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,415
Natural, right?

665
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,000
You can relate to that.

666
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,088
Can you still get...

667
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,593
- Or... Do you still get...
- What? Hard?

668
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,677
Erections?

669
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,013
Sure. Like that.

670
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,598
- Really?
- Albie.

671
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,351
Do you still, like, jerk off?

672
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:04,063
Doctors say you need
to release once a day...

673
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,233
- otherwise you get backed up.
- Wait a second.

674
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,443
Doctors say you need
to jerk off once a day?

675
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,904
- That's right. That's right.
- Which doctors say that?

676
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,240
You need to drain the sack.

677
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,160
- They say that?
- Mm-hmm.

678
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,578
Common knowledge.

679
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,330
God. It just seems like the body

680
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,249
would naturally stop
getting horny

681
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,585
once you're past the age
of procreation, you know?

682
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,629
Like at 50, you would just stop.

683
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,048
Fifty? Fifty's not that old.

684
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,343
- It just seems undignified.
- I'm still virile, by the way.

685
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,844
I could still impregnate
a woman.

686
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,638
- Oh.
- No girl

687
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,724
should have to be exposed
to an old guy's junk.

688
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,813
It's not like it was ever
so beautiful to look at anyway.

689
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,607
I mean, it's a penis.
It's not a sunset.

690
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,786
Hookers.

691
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,829
Really?

692
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,001
Oh, yeah.

693
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,586
Looks like a couple of locals.

694
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,341
Buona sera.

695
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,427
Just because you're here

696
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,804
Come on, man.
You don't recognize a hooker?

697
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,348
So innocent, man.

698
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,641
Just like in college.

699
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,312
Ethan was the original incel.

700
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,105
What are you talking about?
No, I wasn't.

701
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,607
Yeah, you were.
Come on, man.

702
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,693
No, I'm... I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, man.

703
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,976
I'm joking, all right? Look,
you could have gotten laid.

704
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,339
- He's a handsome guy, right?
- Yeah.

705
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,698
Jesus Christ, look at you.

706
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,409
You're a handsome guy.
I'd do ya.

707
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,454
You're just such
a workhorse, man.

708
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,955
You never came out of your room.

709
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,625
Well, he's still like that.

710
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,506
Okay, I think we should
split the arugula salad

711
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,716
and the beet salad,

712
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,094
and then maybe get
the raviolo and the vitello.

713
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,472
I kinda wanted
to try the fish, but...

714
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,307
- The whitefish?
- Yeah.

715
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,809
Hmm.
No, I feel it'll be too fishy.

716
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,894
Okay.

717
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,108
I mean, it's whitefish,
it's pretty light.

718
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,611
It's not a very fishy fish.

719
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,280
Well, you can get it tomorrow.
We're gonna be here all week.

720
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,656
Okay. All right. Yeah.

721
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,830
Or we can have the whitefish.
Let's do it.

722
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,391
I just don't like it
when it's too fishy.

723
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,209
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, sure.

724
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,878
- Great.
- Great. It sounds good.

725
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,670
Let's do it.

726
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,799
- Neat.
- Wine, people?

727
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:37,925
Yes.

728
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,928
- What do we want?
- I like white.

729
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,931
Me too. I prefer white.

730
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,517
Non dimenticar

731
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,105
Although you travel far
My darling

732
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,985
It's my heart you own

733
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,780
So I'll wait alone

734
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,199
Non dimenticar

735
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,878
I don't know
what they're clapping for.

736
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,964
This singer's abominable.

737
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,716
Sounded okay to me.

738
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,532
Go to your room.

739
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:48,203
Go. Your room.
Your room.

740
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:54,668
You're not feeling sluggish
or not concentrating?

741
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,004
Head is fine.
And it's not gonna happen again.

742
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,672
It was a little fall, nothing.

743
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,466
You should sleep
with Albie anyway.

744
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,592
All right.

745
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,309
How was your caprese?

746
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,144
Hmm.

747
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:15,647
I was told that the cheese here
was made by a blind nun

748
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,857
in a basement.

749
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,132
Hey!

750
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:39,731
You know,
I... I think you're fine.

751
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:43,777
You... you didn't hit your head
that hard or... you know,

752
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,572
so, I should...
I'm just gonna go.

753
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,826
So, I'll see you in the morning.

754
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,247
- Good night.
- Good night, Nonno. Sleep well.

755
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,824
Buona sera.

756
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,376
Grazie.

757
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,343
Oh, grazie.

758
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,205
Hmm.

759
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,052
Hmm?

760
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,269
No. No, no, no, no.

761
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,902
Mm-hmm.

762
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,032
Hmm?

763
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,760
She was definitely
more talkative by the pool.

764
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,554
And at dinner,
she was actually kinda nice.

765
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,057
Well...
now that he's loaded,

766
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,351
do you think
he regrets marrying such a dud?

767
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,562
Cam, I wanna FaceTime
them again.

768
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,105
- What?
- Please?

769
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,898
Honey, come on.
We just hung up.

770
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,358
I know, but I miss Emma so much.

771
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,568
I know.
Of course you do.

772
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:30,920
But that's not the point,
all right?

773
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:35,198
The point is...
we're in Italy, honey. Okay?

774
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,908
Mm-Hmm.
We're on vacation.

775
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,827
- Just you and me.
- Yeah.

776
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,080
- We need to enjoy it.
- Okay.

777
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,832
- Just me and my baby.
- Ooh.

778
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,334
- And you know what that means.
- What?

779
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,670
- You need something.
- Mm-hmm.

780
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,380
You need...

781
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,757
- a tickle attack.
- No!

782
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,967
No!

783
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,050
- Please! Stop!
- Tickle, tickle, tickle. I got you!

784
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,639
No, stop it!

785
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,433
Hey, hey!

786
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:04,227
Is he hurting her?

787
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,522
- No! No...
- Hey! Tickle attack!

788
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,610
Monkey man, monkey man!

789
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:12,778
No.

790
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,870
Thanks for making more
of an effort.

791
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,582
I mean, yeah, they kind
of live in a bubble, but...

792
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,293
they're fun, right?

793
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,837
They don't vote, Ethan.

794
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:35,217
I know. What the fuck?
They don't read the news.

795
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,426
They don't read.

796
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:40,138
It's like,
what do they even talk about?

797
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,349
Is that what happens

798
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,619
when you're rich for too long,
your brain just atrophies?

799
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,979
I mean, they seem happy.

800
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,650
No way. It's a front.

801
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:57,739
It's good to have, you know,
diverse friends, I guess.

802
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:01,493
Yeah, I think
we're their diverse friends.

803
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,079
Their White-passing
diverse friends.

804
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,872
Yeah, you're right.

805
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,727
When we came up here
to get the suit,

806
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,956
he just took all
of his clothes off

807
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,732
in the middle of the room.
Like, naked.

808
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,903
And then you...
Like, where were you?

809
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,113
In the bathroom.

810
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,785
Doesn't seem that weird.

811
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,497
Just getting changed.

812
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,065
Baby, come here!
Baby, come on.

813
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,400
No!

814
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,025
Wow.

815
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,126
All right, look.

816
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,295
Look. Listen,
I don't wanna fucking talk

817
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,255
about this right now, okay?

818
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:25,345
Yes, I'm going to. Yeah.
This is not the time.

819
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,139
Yes.

820
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,892
Fuck.

821
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,563
- Hi.
- Hey.

822
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,856
Who are you talking to?

823
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,733
It's work. It's Bob.

824
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:42,237
Oh, Bob. Well,
why were you whispering?

825
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,990
I... I thought you were trying
to get ready for bed.

826
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:48,368
Oh, well. Guess what?

827
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,495
- Huh?
- Look what I found.

828
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,625
- Oh, okay.
- Two macaroons!

829
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,710
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah.

830
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,294
I really did only eat three.

831
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,879
Oh. Well, great.

832
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,589
You had a whole
panna cotta at dinner.

833
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,427
Well, eat them,
'cause you wanted 'em.

834
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,636
I don't want them now.

835
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,263
Why? Yeah, take them,
they're good.

836
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,224
Tanya, I just brushed my teeth.
I'm on the phone.

837
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:19,190
Uh, Bob, I gotta go...

838
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,890
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

839
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,266
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

840
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,909
I went down to the dock
when your boat arrived.

841
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,288
I wanted to see
what you looked like.

842
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,957
What'd you think?

843
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,628
Very handsome.

844
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:28,301
Thank you.

845
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:31,679
And you're from Los Angeles.

846
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:35,058
It's amazing. I always dreamt
of going to Los Angeles.

847
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,267
It is my dream.

848
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,065
Uh, I mean...

849
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,236
You should go.

850
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,491
I don't have the money.

851
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,135
You seem like
a very nice person. Um...

852
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,764
I'm just going through a lot
right now in my life.

853
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:19,727
So, it's... it's, um...

854
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,355
hard for me
to make conversation right now.

855
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:27,986
But you are very, uh, beautiful.

856
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:34,784
I'm glad you're here.

857
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:43,710
Allora...
