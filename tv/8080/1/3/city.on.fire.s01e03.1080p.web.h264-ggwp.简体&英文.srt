00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,850
小萨一直都在这里 没有谁比她更爱音乐了
Sam was here all the time. No one loves the music like her.

5
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,530
对于小萨来说 音乐就是信仰
For Sam, it's a religion.

6
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,530
无论有多拥挤 她总能想办法到最前面
Doesn't matter how crowded it is, she always finds her way to the front.

7
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,510
她从不错过任何一场演出 每晚的演出都更精彩
She never missed a show. Every night was better than the last.

8
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,950
4号那天晚上 有一支乐队在这里表演 他们名叫从无到有
The night of the 4th, a band was playing here, called Ex Nihilo.

9
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,280
你见到萨曼莎了吗
You see Samantha?

10
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,580
是的 但是她没留下来看演出 这很不像她
Yeah, but she didn't stay for the show, which was unlike her.

11
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,550
一定是有其他重要的事
Must've had somewhere real important to be.

12
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,130
她说要去上城 但是会回来
Said she was going uptown, but she'd be back.

13
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,550
但我没有再见过她 她还好吗
But I didn't see her again. Is she okay?

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,810
萨曼莎来的时候是一个人吗
Was Samantha alone when she came by?

15
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,100
和一个小伙子一起
With a young dude.

16
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
他进去了 不确定他什么时候离开的
He went inside. Not sure when he left.

17
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,610
穿28号的牛仔裤  可能会小便失禁的那种男生吗
Size 28 jeans? Type of guy who might piss himself?

18
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,190
听起来是的
Sounds about right.

19
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,110
你能向人像画师形容他的样子吗
You think you can describe him to a sketch artist?

20
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,070
你肯定养成了记人脸的习惯
Bet you make it a habit to remember faces.

21
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,360
但我不习惯告诉警察
But not talk to cops.

22
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,790
来警局吧 别人不需要知道
Come by the station. No one has to know.

23
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,970
嘿 查理 你醒了
Hey, Charlie. You're awake.

24
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,010
你是说有意识了
You mean conscious?

25
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,850
在被你的男友击昏后
After being knocked unconscious by your boyfriend?

26
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,140
好吧 索尔没有用很大力
Okay, Sol didn't hit you that hard.

27
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,730
相信我 我觉得你只是累了
Trust me. Think you were mostly tired.

28
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,780
我的手机和钱包也不见了
I'm also missing my cell phone and my wallet.

29
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,490
我被绑架了吗
Have I been kidnapped?

30
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,160
好 听着 如果扣押我是为索取赎金
Okay, look. If you're holding me for ransom,

31
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,620
我的妈妈可没钱
my mom doesn't have any money.

32
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,660
可不是 你看起来并不是“高价值目标”
Yeah, no shit. You don't exactly scream "high-value target."

33
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,040
我们只是想问问你昨晚看到了些什么
We just have some questions about what you saw last night.

34
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,510
我什么都没看到
I didn't see anything.

35
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,380
我们知道这不是真的
We know that's not true.

36
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,140
那...我的意思是 我见到的东西 我...
Well-- What I meant was, what-- What I did see, I'm--

37
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,470
我并不明白那是什么 而且我很愿意把它抛到脑后
I didn't understand, and I'm more than willing to forget it.

38
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,310
是吗 那你为什么一开始 就在那里鬼鬼祟祟的
No? Why were you creeping around in the first place?

39
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,850
你可以把那玩意放下了
And you can drop that right fucking now.

40
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,730
在我把它从你的小鸡爪子里 抢过来再插进你屁股之前
Before I rip it from your bony hands and shove it up your ass.

41
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,320
我...但是我不是鬼鬼祟祟 我是来找人帮忙的
I-- But I wasn't creeping. I came for help.

42
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,490
帮什么忙
What kind of help?

43
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,410
小萨出事了 听说了吗
Did you guys hear about Sam?

44
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
我们的小萨
Our Sam?

45
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,090
一个女孩在中央公园被枪击
A girl got shot in Central Park.

46
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,140
什么
What?

47
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,890
小萨中枪了
Sam got shot.

48
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,970
小萨没事吧
Is Sam okay?

49
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,180
是 她还活着
Yeah, she's alive.

50
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,190
她处于昏迷状态
She's in a coma.

51
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,690
但是 我去过公园 我找到她了
But I was there in the park, I found her.

52
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,780
该死 查理哥们
Damn, Charlie man.

53
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,490
你还看到什么了吗
Did you see anything else?

54
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
有
Yeah.

55
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,290
那里有个男的站在她旁边
There was this guy standing over her.

56
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,160
他看起来很难过 但...
He seemed upset, but--

57
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,750
但更像是他发现了她 而不是伤害了她
but maybe more like he found her than he hurt her.

58
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,420
我不清楚
I don't know.

59
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,630
我听到警车的声音就跑了 但...
I heard police sirens and then I ran, but...

60
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,420
那里有...
There was a...

61
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,760
她的脑门有个孔
a hole in her forehead.

62
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,310
那里到处是血
There was blood everywhere.

63
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,480
如果我按时赶到 你知道 要是我...
I mean, if I'd been on time, you know, if only I'd--

64
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,730
可是我却在跳舞 偷喝酒 还嗑嗨了
Instead I was dancing, and stealing drinks and getting high.

65
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,780
但我只是想有好玩的故事 可以讲给她听
But I just wanted a good story to tell her, you know.

66
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,160
她爱听有趣的故事
She loves a good story.

67
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,000
你为什么来这里
Why did you come here?

68
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,750
我不知道还能去哪
I mean, I didn't know where else to go.

69
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,040
但是 你们认识小萨
But, I mean, you guys know Sam.

70
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
对吗
Right?

71
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,170
也许你们知道为什么 她原计划和我们一起玩 却离开了
You might know why she made plans to hang out and then just took off?

72
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,010
她为什么把我留在夜店
Why she left me at that club

73
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,430
然后去了一个我们从没 去过的地方 还被枪击了
and then went somewhere we'd never gone before and got shot?

74
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,010
拜托了 你们一定要帮我
Please, you guys have to help me.

75
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,770
我没有别的人可问了 我的...妈妈 她只会将我永久禁足
I-I have no one else. My-- My mom, she'll just ground me forever.

76
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,190
我的心理医生只会告诉我 说我试图救小萨
My therapist will just tell me that I'm trying to save Sam

77
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,900
因为我当初无法救我爸爸 或别的...
because I couldn't save my dad, or some--

78
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,230
你爸爸怎么了
What happened to your dad?

79
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,950
他...
He...

80
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,740
他死在了北塔
He died in North Tower.

81
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,080
天
Oh, fuck.

82
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
查理哥们
Charlie man?

83
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,430
你来对地方了 我们会查清楚的
You came to the right place. We're gonna figure this out.

84
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,520
(剧场)

85
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,450
我不敢相信我被你说服了
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.

86
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,160
是布鲁诺 你爱布鲁诺啊
It's Bruno. You love Bruno.

87
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,910
布鲁诺爱布鲁诺 他是我的艺廊经营者
Bruno loves Bruno. He's my gallerist.

88
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,580
他只在乎一件事 那就是他能卖出去的艺术品
He only cares about one thing and that is art he can sell.

89
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,790
他还带了珍妮来
And he brought Jenny.

90
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,460
艺廊女生是最糟的
Gallery girls are the fucking worst.

91
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,670
她们会讨好你 告诉你你是天才
How they fawn over you and tell you you're a genius.

92
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,760
那真糟糕啊
That's terrible.

93
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,720
- 嗨 你好吗  - 嗨
- Hi. How are you? - Hi.

94
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,350
- 这发型啊 - 别说啦
- This hair, though! - Stop it.

95
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,640
是你自己弄的
Did you do that yourself,

96
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,140
- 还是找人弄的呀  - 拜托
- or did you bring somebody over? - Please.

97
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,060
- 绝对是专业人士 - 专业人士
- Professional all the way. - Professional.

98
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,860
你想知道威廉的问题在哪里吗
You wanna know the problem with William?

99
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,610
我给你解释 墨瑟 好吗
I'll explain it to you, Mercer. Okay?

100
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,030
拜托 他很清楚我的缺点
Please. He's very familiar with my flaws.

101
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,360
他太有天赋了
He was too naturally talented.

102
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,120
那...真可悲
That's-- How tragic.

103
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,740
- 别说了 - 很可怕 真的
- Stop. - It's awful. Really.

104
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,240
不 我认真的 好吗
No. It's true. Okay?

105
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,460
他拥有一切 轻而易举 对吗
Everything has happened for him. Without any effort, right?

106
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,420
含着金汤匙出生 这辈子从不需要工作一天
Born to great wealth. Never needed to work a day in his life.

107
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,880
所以当他遇到困难 他视其为失败
So when he struggles, he views this as a failure,

108
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,050
而不是过程的一部分 懂吧
instead of part of the process. You see?

109
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,210
行 搞心理治疗呢
Okay, therapy.

110
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,300
你不能怪他
You can't blame him.

111
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,180
他的乐队出了一张专辑 那专辑帮助定义了一代人
His band made one album, it helped define a generation.

112
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,760
然后他放弃音乐 转向绘画
Then he gives up music to paint,

113
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,260
他的首场展览就上了《艺术论坛》的封面
and his first show gets the cover of Art Forum.

114
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,770
对 从迈阿密到北京 每一位收藏家
Yes, and every collector from Miami to Beijing

115
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,980
都在争抢他的作品
is fighting over his pieces.

116
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,600
不过只有一个小问题
Except, there's only one little problem--

117
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,480
要开始了 来了
Here we go. It's coming.

118
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,110
他们等待 但是再也没有作品了
They wait, but then there's no more art.

119
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,490
要来了 作品要来了
It's coming, the art is coming.

120
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,240
- 我只需要再多几个月... - 你总是这么对我说
- I just need a few more months-- - This is what you always say to me,

121
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,820
所以我也这么和买家说
and so this is what I tell the buyers.

122
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,240
但你知道吗 没有作品 在他们看来 我就成了骗子
But you know what? When there's nothing, they look at me like I'm a liar.

123
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,330
- 这 我... - 其实
- Well, I-- - Actually,

124
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,120
通常是我和客户打电话联络
I'm usually the one on the phone dealing with the clients.

125
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,710
你一定有什么可以展示给他们
You must have something you're ready to show them.

126
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,290
他所有时间都花在工作室里 他每天好几个小时都在里面
He spends all of his time in the studio. He's there every day for hours?

127
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,550
我手头是有创作中的作品 对
There are some things that I am working on, yes.

128
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,430
有想法 其实更像是...概念
There are ideas. They're more like-- More of concepts, really.

129
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,140
我非常想看到它们实现潜力
I am very excited for them to reach their potential.

130
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,930
但是正如我说的 我需要更多时间
But, as I've said, I need a little more time.

131
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,560
不 听着 没有时间了 好吗
No. Look, there is no more time, okay?

132
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,690
拜托了 威廉 已经有人开始问 你是不是死了
Please. William, people are starting to ask me if you died.

133
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,030
真是个混蛋 嘿 累积需求越多越好 对吧
What a bastard. Hey! The more pent-up demand is, right?

134
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,820
- 这样价格越高 - 拜托 他只是在谦虚
- The higher the price is. - Come on. He's just being modest.

135
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,620
他从不认为自己的作品出色
He never thinks anything he does is any good.

136
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,830
好吧 这交给我们评判
Okay, well, we will be the judge of that.

137
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,200
本
Ben.

138
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,830
- 那是什么意思 你在做什么  - 什么 我们走了
- What does that mean? What are you doing? - What? We're leaving.

139
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,460
- 我们去哪里  - 我们去工作室
- Where are we going? - We're going to the studio.

140
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,500
我们都得看看你在创作些什么
We all must see what it is that you have been creating.

141
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,380
不过我先喝杯浓缩咖啡
I'm gonna get an espresso first, though.

142
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,880
听着 大家来这里是因为我们都支持你
Look, everyone is here because we are rooting for you.

143
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,170
好吗 我们爱你 威廉
All right? We love you, William.

144
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,470
- 还需要什么吗  - 不
- Would you like anything else? - No.

145
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,430
- 动身 走吧 - 走 去叫辆德士
- Come on. Let's go. - Go, get a cab.

146
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,310
我们外面见 好吗 我去洗手间
I'll meet you outside, okay? I'm gonna hit the head.

147
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,390
好的
Okay.

148
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,950
我妈有夜惊的毛病 会做梦梦见我死去
My mom has night terrors. Like, dreams where I die.

149
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,870
所以她就连让我去上学 都要挣扎一番 你知道吗
So it's hard for her to even let me go to school, you know?

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,460
所以她讨厌小萨
Which means she hated Sam.

151
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,090
因为小萨将我拉进那个世界
'Cause Sam pulled me into the world.

152
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:20,180
拉进了她的世界 而那个世界嘛 不太安全
Into Sam's world, which is not exactly risk-free.

153
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,310
所以发生的事可以说是 拉蒙娜威斯巴格最坏的噩梦了
So what happened was basically Ramona Weisbarger's worst nightmare,

154
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,690
只不过是发生在小萨身上
except it happened to Sam.

155
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,820
而我也有责任
No thanks to me.

156
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,950
你真以为自己能够保护她
You really think you could have protected her?

157
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,990
- 扳倒一个带枪的家伙  - 不...我...
- Taken down a guy with a gun? - No. I--

158
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,660
但如果我在场 我愿意为她挡下子弹
But I would have taken a bullet for her if I was there.

159
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,120
自责
Guilt.

160
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,790
解释了你为什么带着这个
Explains why you've been carrying this around.

161
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,380
(钦定版圣经)

162
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,090
先知查理
Charlie, the Prophet.

163
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,970
不是的 我读都没读过
No. I haven't even read it.

164
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,550
我都不确定如果读了我是否会相信 但...
I'm not sure if I'd even believe it if I did. But...

165
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,140
我猜里面有关于宽恕的话
presumably, there's something about forgiveness in there.

166
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,020
你现在需要那个吗
That's what you need right now?

167
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,400
非常需要 我甚至无法呼吸
So bad I can hardly breathe.

168
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,690
查理 好的 闭上眼睛
Oh, Charlie. Okay, close your eyes.

169
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:27,160
想着萨曼莎 让她充满你的思绪
You think of Samantha. Let the thought of her fill you up.

170
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,080
现在睁开眼睛
Now, open your eyes.

171
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,590
看着我 直直看着我 别移开目光
Look at me. Right at me. Don't look away.

172
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,050
《圣经》说所有真正忏悔的罪孽者
The Bible says that all sinners who truly repent,

173
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,510
应被施以极大的慈悲 被宽恕所有的罪行
shall be granted great mercy and forgiven all offenses.

174
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,060
无论我们做了什么或为什么做
Doesn't matter what we've done, or why we did it.

175
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,520
这是上帝的律法
This is the law of God.

176
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,440
当然 我不是牧师
Now, I'm no priest.

177
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,530
不过是一个有在主日学校好好听课的小孩
Just a kid who paid attention in Sunday school.

178
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,320
但这里就我们两个男人
But I am the only other guy here,

179
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,660
意味着赦罪的职责只能落在我肩上
which means the job of absolution falls on me.

180
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,710
查理威斯巴格 我赦免你的罪
Charlie Weisbarger, I absolve you.

181
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,420
你已被赦免
You are absolved.

182
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,510
嘿 小子 发生在小萨身上的事 并不是你的错 听到了吗
Hey, kid, what happened to Sam is not your fault. You hear me?

183
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,550
说出来
Say it.

184
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,140
- 发生在小萨身上的事不是我的错 - 不 要真的相信
- What happened to Sam was not my fault. - Nah, a little more like you mean it.

185
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,390
发生在小萨身上的事不是我的错
What happened to Sam was not my fault.

186
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,440
站起来 喊出来
You stand up and yell it.

187
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,610
- 发生在小萨身上的事不是我的错 - 喊出来
- What happened to Sam was not my fault. - Yell it.

188
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,530
- 发生在小萨身上的事不是我的错 - 大声
- What happened to Sam was not my fault. - Louder!

189
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,990
发生在小萨身上的事不是我的错
What happened to Sam was not my fault!

190
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,050
显然 它还处在理论阶段
Obviously, it's living in a theoretical space.

191
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,130
(点)

192
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,510
它变得更具体有形的生命之旅刚开始
Just beginning its life journey into a more tangible form.

193
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,720
所以这是个停车标志
So that's a stop sign?

194
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,770
曾经是停车标志 现在是“点”标志
I mean, it was a stop sign, but now it is a "spot" sign.

195
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,110
拜托 哟 就...
Come on. Yo, just--

196
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,200
想象一下 在纽约街头遇到这个
Imagine encountering this in the streets of New York City.

197
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,990
对 因为街道是唯一一个
Yes, because the streets is the only place

198
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,290
人们会见到这种垃圾的地方
where anyone is going to see this piece of shit.

199
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,540
威廉 你还有别的作品吗
Do you have anything else, William?

200
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,210
没有已经完成到这一步的
I mean, nothing that is as far along as this.

201
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,380
没有比“点”标志更完整的作品  我不懂了 威廉
Far along as a "spot" sign? I don't understand, William.

202
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,090
你总是泡在这里
After all the time you've been spending here,

203
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,260
这就是你唯一能交出来的东西
this is all you have to show for it?

204
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,720
拜托 墨瑟 别说了 好吗
Please. Mercer, please. Okay?

205
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,060
他显然只是来这里吸毒
It is obvious he has been coming here only to get high.

206
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,440
而且你现在已经嗑嗨了 对吧
Not to mention that you are high right now, huh?

207
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,570
对 你瞧 你浪费了我的时间
Yeah. See? You have wasted my time.

208
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,110
但是更糟的是你浪费了自己的才华
But worse, you are wasting your talent.

209
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,910
有争议 但我挺喜欢的
Controversial, but I kind of love it.

210
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,930
所以你在剧场餐厅的洗手间注射毒品了
So, you shot up in the bathroom at Odeon?

211
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,520
我又没办法在桌子上弄
It's not like I could've just done it right there at the table.

212
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,020
麦克纳利对那种行为不待见
McNally sort of frowns at that.

213
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,730
- 你说过要戒的 - 我会戒的
- You said you were quitting. - I will.

214
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,440
我在戒 好吗 宝贝 我真的想戒 我会的
I am, okay? Babe. I really want to. I'm going to.

215
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,120
我想要的是不再为了这件事争吵
What I want is to stop having this fight.

216
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,910
我们这样要怎么走下去
How are we supposed to go on like this?

217
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,420
也许我们不该走下去
Maybe we're not supposed to.

218
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,800
你在走一条黑暗的道路 威廉
You're going down a dark road, William.

219
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,300
尽头是一个“点”标志
One that ends in a "spot" sign

220
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,220
除此之外什么都没了
and nothing else.

221
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,120
蕾根 我们不知道你会来 亲爱的
Regan, we weren't expecting you, dear.

222
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,420
尝尝鸡蛋 口感像云一样很松软
Try the eggs. It's like eating a cloud.

223
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,210
不 我不会留下
No, I'm not staying.

224
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,050
我来这里只是因为我觉得让爸爸和我
I'm just here because I thought it might be nice for Daddy and I

225
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,590
一起走进办公室比较好
to walk into the office together.

226
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,300
这对他来说会是艰难的一天
It's gonna be a rough day for him,

227
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,050
因为有人把审前传讯泄露给媒体了
since someone leaked the pretrial arraignment to the press.

228
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,100
(汉密尔顿斯维尼集团老板 因欺诈指控被起诉)

229
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,680
我看到了 真是卑鄙
I saw. Nasty stuff.

230
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,690
我还以为我们人缘很好
And I thought people liked us.

231
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,270
人们喜欢丑闻 无论谁受损
People like scandal at anyone's expense.

232
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,400
嗨 亲爱的
Hi, honey.

233
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,030
嗨 爸爸 你没穿好衣服
Hi, Daddy. You're not dressed.

234
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,030
艾莫里和菲莉希亚没告诉你
Amory and Felicia didn't tell you?

235
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,370
我今天不去上班 或者说 以后也不去
I'm not going in today. Or ever.

236
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,990
没人告诉过我啊
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

237
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,660
我的错 这是他审前释放的条件之一
My failing. It's a condition of his pretrial release.

238
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,330
不 我读过协议 上面根本没提到
No, I read the agreement and it said nothing about him

239
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,880
他不去办公室
not going into the office.

240
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,550
是在附件备忘录里写的 以防协议被泄露
It was in a side memo in case the agreement was leaked,

241
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,760
也的确被泄露了 那帮秃鹰
as it was, the fucking vultures.

242
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,300
就当是退休吧 我已经开始策划派对了
We'll call it retirement. I've already started planning the party.

243
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,510
派对
A party.

244
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,520
唯一比你父亲的辩护更重要的是他的健康
The only thing more important than your father's defense is his health.

245
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,390
这样他可以同时关注于两件事
This way, he can focus on both.

246
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,570
律师可以来这里办事 一切都是私下处理 舒舒服服
The lawyers can come here to work. Everything very private, comfortable.

247
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,410
爸 这是你想要的吗
Dad, is that what you want?

248
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,200
亲爱的 这是大家想要的
Darling, it's what everyone wants.

249
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,370
你努力工作 创造美好的人生 然后终于能享受了
You work hard to create a beautiful life, then you finally get to enjoy it.

250
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,870
要我说 越早享受越好
The sooner the better, I say.

251
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,670
亲爱的 你去 照常工作
You go, sweetie. Business as usual.

252
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,710
董事会得看到你可以处理好事务 在没有我的情况下
The board needs to see that you can handle things. Without me.

253
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,470
我会打电话给你的 我爱你
Well, I'll call you. I love you.

254
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,630
我也爱你
Love you too.

255
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,310
如果你不给我她的号码 请直接打给她 这事很重要
If you won't give me her number, please just call her, it's important.

256
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,470
- 再说一次 我叫墨... - 墨瑟
- Once again my name is M-- - Mercer.

257
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,650
抱歉 兰普莱特太太 我不知道你认识他
Sorry, Mrs. Lamplighter. I didn't realize that you knew him.

258
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,360
真的吗 为什么
Oh, really? And why is that?

259
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,070
嘿 我可投票给了丁肯斯
Hey. I voted for Dinkins.

260
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,360
好吧
Okay.

261
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,610
我只是来看我父亲 你为什么来这
I was just stopping by to see my father. What are you doing here?

262
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,200
我只知道在这个地方能找到你 这事不能等 是关于威廉
It was the only place I knew to find you. It couldn't wait. It's William.

263
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,830
我们今晚会在我们的公寓组织戒毒干预会
We're having an intervention at our apartment tonight.

264
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,790
不 他会很不喜欢的
No. He's gonna hate that.

265
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,580
他更不喜欢的是死
Not as much as he'll hate being dead.

266
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
已经那么严重了
It's that bad?

267
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,970
我知道他想要帮助
I know he wants help.

268
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,220
即使他不开口要求
Even if he won't ask for it.

269
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,760
所以我承担下责任 去找任何还在乎威廉的
So I've just been tasked with finding any of William's friends and family

270
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,100
朋友和家人
who still care about him.

271
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,230
- 是 - 希望这包括你
- Yeah. - I hope that includes you.

272
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,980
(前事追溯 《黄铜战术》)

273
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,170
小萨是一位艺术家
Sam is an artist.

274
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,050
把这里用作她的工作室 也可能是储藏间
Used this place as her studio, or maybe a storage locker,

275
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,640
但是 我不知道这有什么重要的
but not sure how any of this matters.

276
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,680
我的直觉是小萨认识开枪的人
My instinct is Sam knew her shooter.

277
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,930
感觉这不是意外
This doesn't feel like a "wrong place, wrong time" situation.

278
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,480
萨曼莎没有被袭击 没有物品被偷走
Samantha wasn't assaulted. Nothing was stolen.

279
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,860
第一枪打偏了 第二枪击中了她 但是没有要她的命
First shot went wide, second one got her, but didn't kill her.

280
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,610
那个枪击者没有留下来确认这一点
Fact that the shooter didn't stick around to verify, you know,

281
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,660
还好如此
very thankful for that,

282
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,910
但这让我觉得 这是私人恩怨 但是业余人士做的
but it makes me think that this was personal, but amateur.

283
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,880
有动机的枪手 但没什么经验
A shooter with a motive, but not a lot of experience.

284
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,290
不幸的是
Now, unfortunately,

285
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,750
本案的大部分物证都用不上
most of the physical evidence in this case is shit.

286
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,300
所以我们找到这凶手的途径就是动机
So, the way we find this perp is motive.

287
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,220
也就是说要尽可能了解关于你女儿的一切
That means learning everything we can about your daughter.

288
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
有孩子吗
Got any kids?

289
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,310
还没有 正在努力
Not yet. I'm working on it.

290
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,440
那你完全不懂我的心情
Then you've no goddamn clue.

291
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,200
他们一出生起 你就尽一切努力去保护他们
Moment they're born, you do everything you can to protect them,

292
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,530
然后却发生了这样的事
and then something like this happens.

293
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,080
杨先生
Look, Mr. Yeung.

294
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,040
这是你经历过最艰难的一件事
This is the hardest thing you're ever gonna go through.

295
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,010
每个人都需要依靠些什么来支撑自己
And everybody needs something to lean on.

296
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,090
来维持信念 对我来说 我相信的是一位父亲的爱
To believe in. For me, I believe in a father's love.

297
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
我相信你
I believe in you.

298
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,980
我们要找到对她做了这事的人 但没有你的帮助就做不到
We're gonna find who did this to her, but not without your help.

299
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,730
没有谁比你更了解萨曼莎
You know Samantha better than anyone.

300
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,400
那是她最喜欢的
That one's her favorite.

301
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:32,250
我听说音乐对于昏迷中的人来说有益
You know, I think I heard that music is good for people in comas.

302
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,080
让他们与现实保持联结
Keeps them connected.

303
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,420
你找到手机了吗
You find a cell phone?

304
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,050
没有 她有手机吗
No. Did she have one?

305
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,550
从没给我她的号码 但我见她用过几次手机
Never gave me her number, but I saw her on it a couple times.

306
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,760
这样啊 也许是某个 不希望我们知道她和谁交朋友的人
Could be someone who didn't want us to know who her friends were.

307
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,600
你会想看看这个的
You'll wanna see this.

308
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,610
她叫这个杂志
She calls it a zine.

309
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,490
总是在弄这个
Was always working on it.

310
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,660
总是去金考店打印
Heading over to Kinko's all hours, making copies.

311
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,540
如果你想了解我的女儿 那信息都在这里面
If you wanna know my daughter, it's in there.

312
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,340
那么 你为什么会在这里
So, how'd you end up down here?

313
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,800
应该是因为我喜欢过山车吧
I guess because I love roller coasters.

314
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,350
我妈妈在我16岁时去世
My mom died when I was 16.

315
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,400
没有爸爸 所以在那之后 我就从路易斯安那一路北上流浪了
No dad, so I just kind of drifted up north from Louisiana after that.

316
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,940
从孟菲斯 到纳什维尔 辛辛那提 清理旅店房间
Cleaned motel rooms from Memphis to Nashville to Cincinnati.

317
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,570
然后我听说俄亥俄桑达斯基的杉点游乐园
Then I heard about Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio.

318
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,950
我想一个有18个世界级过山车
Figured a place with 18 world-class roller coasters

319
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,790
和一个水上乐园的地方应该不会太糟
and a water park couldn't be all bad.

320
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,790
但我错了
But I was wrong.

321
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,170
我不知道你对清理旅店房间 有什么了解 查理
I don't know what you've heard about cleaning motel rooms, Charlie,

322
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,590
但是这是个低工资 高风险的职业
but it's a low-pay, high-risk profession.

323
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,840
只能在短时间内赚到钱
Math only goes your way for so long.

324
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,930
然后发生了什么
And then what happens?

325
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,800
然后就不赚钱了
Then it goes the other way.

326
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
所以
So...

327
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,400
这是他们叫你“下水道女孩”的原因
that's why they call you Sewer Girl?

328
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,740
因为你住在下水道或...
'Cause you were, like, living in the gutters or--

329
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,820
不是
No.

330
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,280
不 尼基说我困在 某种较低水平的意识层面上
No, Nicky says I'm stuck on a lower level of consciousness.

331
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,290
我仍然会因为可爱的动物照片而感动
I still get sentimental about cute animal pics

332
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,660
还有我的星座这类玩意
and my horoscope and shit.

333
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,370
他说等我成长后我可以选个新的名字
He says I can pick a new name once I evolve,

334
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,630
但我好像习惯这名字了
but I don't know, kinda used to it.

335
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,250
好的 抱歉 那么 尼基是怎么回事
Okay, sorry, wha-- So, what's the deal with Nicky?

336
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,420
我以为他是翻唱乐队的主唱
I thought he was, like, the lead singer in a cover band?

337
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,510
你不懂 查理
You don't get it, Charlie.

338
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,640
但你会懂的 乐队只是个幌子
But you will. The band is the cover.

339
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,320
跟我来
Come with me.

340
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,400
立刻
Now.

341
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,410
跟上
Come on.

342
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,050
好的 这是乐队的排练地点 但我们正在翻改
Okay. This is the band's rehearsal space, but we're converting it.

343
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,800
你不需要知道改成什么
To what, you don't need to know.

344
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,260
但这些设备都要搬到地下室
But all this equipment goes into the basement,

345
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,470
窗户得封上 地毯得移除
the window needs to be covered and the carpet has to go.

346
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
好多地毯
That's a lot of carpet.

347
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,520
那你最好马上开始干活
Then you better get started.

348
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,770
等等 我要一个人做吗
Wait, I'm doing this all by myself?

349
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,480
这是尼基的主意
Was this Nicky's idea?

350
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,990
这里发生的一切都是尼基的主意
Nothing happens here that isn't Nicky's idea.

351
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,310
嘿 是给我的吗
Hey. Is that for me?

352
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,520
这是什么和你一点也无关
It's none of your goddamn business is what it is.

353
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,120
(证据)

354
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,450
(乌托邦 破裂的混沌)

355
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,540
(假装不孤独)

356
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,920
他很笨拙 像只小狗 眼神无辜 面带微笑
He was awkward. Like a puppy. Sweet-eyed. Smiley.

357
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,010
也许有些雀斑
Maybe some freckles.

358
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:20,680
他的头发是卷的 白人男孩的卷发 拖把发型
And his hair was curly. White boy curly. A mop.

359
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
像这样吗
Like this?

360
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,390
就是他
That's him.

361
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,140
真准啊 那孩子就是只小奶狗
Nailed it. That kid's a fucking labradoodle.

362
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,980
等等 枪击 什么枪击
Wait. A shooting? What shooting?

363
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,110
就在派对外面 中央公园的女孩
The-- Right outside the party. The girl in Central Park.

364
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,650
可怜的孩子是纽约大学的学生
Poor thing was an NYU student.

365
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,820
墨瑟发现了她 把外套盖在她身上
Mercer found her and put his jacket over her.

366
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,160
那是...威廉的外套 因为是他借的
Well, it's like-- It was William's jacket, 'cause he borrowed it.

367
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,370
然后 当警察找到毒品
And then when the cops found the drugs,

368
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,250
墨瑟意识到威廉是个瘾君子
that's when Mercer realized that William's a fucking junkie.

369
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,090
那女孩 她还好吗
Is she okay, this girl?

370
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,090
你还知道关于她的其他信息吗
You know anything else about her?

371
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,090
她处于昏迷状态
I mean, she's in a coma.

372
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,010
他们不会公布其他信息
And they're not releasing any other information.

373
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,930
据说她是大一生 我不清楚
Apparently she's a freshman, I think. I don't know.

374
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,020
她是大一生
She's freshman.

375
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,850
有什么区别呢 对吧
What difference does it make, really, right?

376
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,980
你说得对 是啊 就是个悲剧
You're right. Yeah, it's tragic.

377
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,320
天啊 我好紧张 我太紧张了
Oh, my God. I'm so nervous. I am so fucking nervous.

378
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,780
我懂
I get it.

379
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,030
你好
Hello.

380
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,110
蕾根
Regan,

381
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,120
要召开紧急董事会会议 我们得在办公室开会
there's an emergency board meeting. We need to convene at the office.

382
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,290
- 今晚吗  - 恐怕如此 时间紧迫
- Tonight? - Afraid so. It's time-sensitive.

383
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,960
我不能去 重新安排时间吧
I can't. Just reschedule.

384
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,170
让吉斯看孩子没问题吧
Well, surely Keith can watch the children.

385
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,290
正如我们担心的
As we feared,

386
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,000
董事会非常担忧比尔面临的指控
the board is extremely concerned about the charges against Bill.

387
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,340
那就向他们保证他是无辜的
So then reassure them that he's innocent.

388
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,050
- 你能不能... - 我...
- Can you get--? - Well, I--

389
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,470
- 我显然一再保证了 但... - 孩子
- Obviously, I have, strenuously, but-- - Kids.

390
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:48,640
艾莫里 是威廉的事 他遇到麻烦了 我得去帮他
Amory, it's William. He's in trouble, and I need to be there.

391
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,690
威廉 我不知道你们有联系
William. I hadn't realized you'd connected.

392
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,480
很抱歉让你为难
I'm sorry to put you in this position

393
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,440
逼你在父亲和弟弟之间做选择
having to choose between your father and your brother,

394
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,320
但这是目前的现实
but this is where we are.

395
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,030
如果你需要 随时找我
I'm here if you need me.

396
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,280
再见 艾莫里
Goodbye, Amory.

397
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,200
如果我想说 我会的 好吧
If I wanted to share, I would. Okay.

398
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,460
亲爱的 你的最爱
My dear, your favorite.

399
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,630
- 三文鱼 - 好吧
- Salmon. - Okay.

400
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,460
天啊 我不能迟到 我得走了
Oh, my God. I cannot be late. I have to go.

401
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,420
但你会留下 妈妈 对吗
But you're staying. Right, Mom?

402
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,970
不 宝贝 对不起 我不能
No. Sweetie, I'm sorry. I can't.

403
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,510
我只是来给你们做晚餐的
I just came to make you dinner.

404
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,430
我们应该感谢妈妈做晚餐
Which we should thank her for.

405
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,100
我说了 凯特 放弃吧 他们不会复合的
I told you, Cate. Give it up. They're not getting back together.

406
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,350
- 嘿 我们又不知道 - 我们知道
- Hey, we don't know that. - Yeah, we do.

407
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,940
无论如何 没什么比家庭更重要的
Still, there's nothing more important than family.

408
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,610
好吗
Okay?

409
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
我爱你们俩
I love you both.

410
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,610
威尔 尝尝吧 拜托了
Will, just try it, please.

411
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,640
你今天看够了 欣赏得开心吗
You got an eyeful today. Like what you saw?

412
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,600
我没说不喜欢 我只是不懂
I didn't not like it. I just don't understand.

413
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,770
你是索尔的女友 对吧  所以你也和尼基在一起
You're Sol's girl, right? So, are you with Nicky too, or what?

414
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,780
我可没有你那种乡巴佬式的玻璃心 我不会为此道歉
I won't apologize for not conforming to your delicate suburban sensibilities.

415
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,900
一夫一妻只是父权制度资本主义的工具
Monogamy is just a tool of patriarchal capitalism.

416
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,330
听起来像是小萨会说的话
That sounds exactly like something that Sam would say,

417
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,490
我则会假装理解
and that I would, like, pretend to understand.

418
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,660
小萨是个笃信者
Sam is a believer.

419
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,040
笃信什么 随便和人上床
A believer in what, sleeping around?

420
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,840
要我说 小萨在守身
If you ask me, Sammy's saving herself.

421
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
为谁守身
For what?

422
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,760
谁知道 也许是你呢 查理哥们
Who knows? Could be you, Charlie man.

423
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,050
嘿 过来
Hey. Come over here.

424
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,980
我们开始这场革命时 就知道会有代价
When we started this revolution, we knew it would have a cost.

425
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,980
今晚 我们要致敬 一位正在为自己的生命而战的受伤战士
And tonight, we celebrate a wounded warrior fighting for her life.

426
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,650
敬小萨 今晚是献给她的
To Sam. Tonight's for her.

427
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,610
- 敬小萨 - 小萨
- To Sammy. - To Sam. - To Sammy. - Sam.

428
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,580
什么叫为了小萨 我们在做什么
What's for Sam? What are we doing?

429
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,330
我们都不认识这小子
We don't even know this fucking kid.

430
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,000
他以非常快的速度进入了我们的圈子
He has had a rather rapid ascent into our good graces,

431
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,840
但他给我们带来什么好处了吗
but what does he bring to the table, really?

432
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,920
小萨喜欢他
Sam likes him.

433
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,800
所以呢 她什么都没和他说 那我们为什么要说
Yeah? Well, she didn't tell him shit. So, why should we?

434
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,180
好的 无论小萨知道什么 我也想知道
All right, well, whatever Sam knew, I wanna know too.

435
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,060
把我打晕 将我锁起来 逼我做苦工
Knock me out. Lock me up. Force me into hard labor.

436
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,940
随便什么 我什么都行
Whatever. I'm all in.

437
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,690
该死
Oh, shit.

438
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
他什么都行
He's all in.

439
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,450
我们走着瞧吧
Guess we'll see about that.

440
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,080
零点即将到来
The zero hour is upon us.

441
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,000
我们玩点好玩的吧
Let's have some fun.

442
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,720
- 别紧张 威廉不会敲门的 - 好的
- Relax. William wouldn't knock. - Right.

443
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,810
- 嗨 - 嗨
- Hi. - Hey.

444
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,520
- 真感谢你来 - 是
- Thank you so much for coming. - Uh-huh.

445
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,150
蕾根 这是维纳斯德尼龙
Regan, this is Venus De Nylon.

446
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,400
嗨 我是威廉的姐姐
Hi. I'm William's sister.

447
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,780
我不知道他有个姐姐
Didn't know he had a sister.

448
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,070
维纳斯曾是前事追溯的键盘手
Venus played keyboard for Ex Post Facto.

449
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,870
必须由我代表乐队来
Had to represent.

450
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,370
原乐队的人要不就是比比利的情况更严重
Everyone from the original band's either more fucked up than Billy,

451
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,250
要不就是恨他或是已经死了
hates him or is already dead.

452
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,090
我们还在世的人只能尽我们所能了
Well, we who are living will have to do everything that we can.

453
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,500
你好 嗨
Hello. Hi.

454
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
来
Come.

455
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,090
- 请坐 - 谢谢
- Have a seat. - Thanks.

456
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
嘿
Hey.

457
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,060
我只想说声谢谢你
I just wanted to say thank you

458
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,310
感谢你在威廉身边没人的时候 陪伴和支持他
for being there for William when no one else was.

459
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,900
当然
Of course.

460
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,980
大家都准备好了吗
So, everyone ready?

461
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,030
- 是 - 对
- Yes. - Yeah.

462
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,150
威廉随时可能走进来
Any moment now, William's gonna walk through that door,

463
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,320
他大概不会喜欢眼前的景象
and he is probably not gonna like what he sees.

464
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,370
因为你们是来这里告诉他你们爱他
Because you're here to tell him that you love him.

465
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,620
爱意味着要承担责任
Love makes people accountable.

466
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,100
(中央公园枪击案尚无嫌犯)

467
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,060
嗨 我是小萨 请留言
Hey, you've reached Sam. Please leave a message,

468
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,230
你也可以用怀旧的方式 打我的传呼机
or you can do it the old-fashioned way and page me.

469
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,820
语音信箱已满 无法接收任何讯息...
The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages--

470

(西西亚罗意大利餐厅)

471
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,760
- 你好 - 嗨 桑托斯太太
- Hello. - Hey, Mrs. Santos.

472
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,430
希望我的电话不算太迟
I hope I haven't called too late.

473
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,800
嗨 威廉 我叫厄尔
Hello, William. My name's Earl.

474
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,130
今天这些善良的人们聚在这里
These good folks here gathered today

475
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,470
是因为他们担心你会死去
because they're afraid that you're gonna die.

476
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,180
你想坐下吗
Would you like to have a seat?

477
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,940
不 厄尔 我不坐下
No, Earl, I would not.

478
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,070
好吧 威廉 听我说 这是我的主意
Okay, listen. This was my idea, William.

479
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,400
你可以生我的气 但是最重要的是 你需要生自己的气
So you can be mad at me, but mostly, you need to be mad at yourself.

480
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,700
因为你的毒瘾正在削弱 你作为艺术家的作品
Because your addiction is diminishing your work as an artist,

481
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,870
但你的谎言则在削弱你的人格
but your lying, your lying is diminishing you as a person.

482
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,750
所以求求你 不要表现得 像是你不需要这次干预
So please, please don't act like you are better than this.

483
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,580
说完了吗
You're done?

484
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,680
厄尔只是在尽本职 我很感谢他
Earl here is just doing his job. And I appreciate that.

485
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,680
就算是布鲁诺 我也理解
Fuck. I mean, Bruno, I understand.

486
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,140
我没有作品给你售卖
I have nothing for you to sell,

487
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,480
因此 我对你来说没有价值
and therefore I am of no value to you.

488
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,120
但是你 宝贝
But you, babe.

489
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,330
你
You?

490
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,290
你真觉得这会有用
Did you really think this was gonna work?

491
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,050
他不认为这会有用
He didn't think this would work.

492
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,670
他只是没别的办法向你表达他爱你了
He's just running out of ways to show you that he loves you.

493
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,840
你是哪位啊
Who are you exactly?

494
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,390
请...别这样
Don't-- Please don't do that.

495
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,850
我可真佩服
I'm impressed.

496
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,350
嘿 小蕾
Hey, Reegs.

497
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,900
有多久了 15年了吧
What-- What has it been, 15 years, right?

498
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,610
对 差不多吧
Yeah. Give or take.

499
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,450
天啊
Wow.

500
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,570
我用了那么久时间找到你
That's how long it took me to find you.

501
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,080
真的
Really?

502
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,500
别这样 别离开 不
Don't do that. Don't go. No.

503
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,420
我很想你
I miss you.

504
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,840
- 我的天啊 - 不 我非常想你
- Oh, my God. - No, I miss you so much.

505
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,220
- 我现在不能做这件事 我做不到 - 我从没停止想念你
- I can't do this right now. I can't. - I never stopped missing you.

506
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,050
找到我并没那么难
I wasn't that hard to find.

507
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,520
- 所以无论这是在做什么... - 不
- So whatever this is... - No.

508
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,560
- 我之前有个乐队 我们出了一张专辑 - 我知道
- I was in a band. We made an album. - I know.

509
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,110
我在一家画廊开了展览
I had a show at a gallery that was reviewed

510
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,610
《纽约时报》都登了评论
by The New York fucking Times.

511
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,280
我距离你从来都不超过20分钟
I was never more than 20 minutes away from you.

512
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,540
你走路就能找到我
You could have walked.

513
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,620
我有个家庭 我有两个孩子 我之前结婚了 有工作 我...
I had a family. I had two kids. I was married. I had a job. I was--

514
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,120
我就在原地
I was right fucking there.

515
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,250
- 就在你离开我的地方 没有动过 - 在...
- Right where you left me. Right there. - Where--

516
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,340
在我离开你的地方
Where I left you.

517
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,600
我希望你和我一起离开
I wanted you to come with me.

518
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,980
我乞求你和我一起离开 我只是想要保护你
I fucking begged you to come with me. I just wanted to protect you.

519
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,400
我希望我们的父亲保护你
I wanted our father to protect you.

520
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,360
我不知道还能做什么 我如履薄冰
I didn't know what else to do. I was hanging on by a fucking thread.

521
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,620
我必须想办法生存下去 我...
I had to find a way to survive. I didn't--

522
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,330
- 恭喜你啊 小蕾 - 拜托
- Well, congratulations, Reegs... - Please.

523
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,250
你活下来了 你熬出头了
...that you survived. You did it.

524
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,290
拜托
Please.

525
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:02,550
你什么都不用做
You don't have to do anything.

526
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,090
我爱你
I love you.

527
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,800
我都不认识这些人
I don't even know these people,

528
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,680
但我希望你明白我有多爱你
but I wish you understood how much I love you.

529
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,060

So, if I leave with Earl here, it's the only way you'll love me?

Your roommate's panda fetish isn't making this any less weird.

她去得梅因度假了
She's in Des Moines for the holidays,

- so you can focus on me, not her. - Okay.

570
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,680
你呢 你有什么癖好
What about you? What are you into?

571
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,310
因为看起来你都没在这里住
'Cause it looks like you don't even live here.

572
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,940
我的癖好是你 你知道我住在哪
I'm into you. And you know where I live.

573
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,620

我了解你后 我意识到我其实...
Now that I know you, I realized I don't--

我其实并不真的了解你 一个已婚的金融男
I don't really know you. A married finance guy.

577
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,550
你为什么会闯入我的世界
How did you end up on my doorstep?

578
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,560
有秘密的不只是你
You're not the only one with secrets.

579

我 我没有秘密
Who, me? I'm an open book.

580
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,030
这是你说过最大的谎了 瞧瞧你说得多么自然
That's the biggest lie you've told yet. Look how easily it came.

581
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,080
- 告诉我你为谁工作 - 没有谁 我是自雇人士
- Tell me who you work for. - No one. I'm self-employed.

582
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,660
每个人都有顶头上司
Everyone answers to someone.

583
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,060

I was just wondering if you knew how she's doing,

589
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,450
或是最近几天有没有见过她
or if you've seen her in the last couple of days.

590
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:09,120
对 警察也在好奇
Yeah, the cops wondered that too.

591
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,210
警察来过这里
The cops were here?

592
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,620

蕾根 和威廉的重聚怎么样

It was short-lived. And I see I'm too late.

Not at all. Amory has swooped in and saved the day.

在我们找到合适人选接任你父亲之前 他会担任临时主席
He's interim chair until we can find a suitable replacement for your father.

604
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,410

The board is very happy. The ship has been steadied.

605
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,330
对 或是被劫持了
Yeah, or hijacked.

606
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:39,170
你逼迫我父亲退休
I mean, you force my father into retirement

607
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,260
然后首席执行官的职位 就自然而然落到你头上
and then the CEO job just falls right into your lap.

608
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,510
临时的 在我们找到永久替任人选之前

Ne cede malis. Means "yield not to evil."

618

查理哥们 怎么了

621
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,550
我不懂我们在这做什么
I don't understand what we're doing here.

622
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,930
小萨热爱音乐 她不喜欢暴力
Sam loves music. She's not into violence.

623
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,260
- 她不会伤害任何人 - 我们也不会
- She'd never hurt anybody. - And neither would we.

624
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,760
没关系的 查理 那栋楼里没人住
It's okay, Charlie. No one lives in that building.

625
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,180
那为什么
Then why?

626
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,520
小萨也问过同样的问题
Sam asked the same questions you are.

627
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,530
我尽力回答了 我们爱这座城市
I tried my best to answer. We love this city.

628
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,280
我们认为它应该属于音乐人和艺术创造者
We think it should belong to the musicians and the artists.

629
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,370
属于黑人和棕色人种
To the Black and the brown folks.

630
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,040
属于梦想者 瘾君子和诗人
To the dreamers, the junkies, the poets.

631
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,670
但是一些很坏的人 正试图将城市从我们手中夺走 而...
But some very bad people are trying to take that away from us, and...

632
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,170
我们只是在反击
we're just fighting back.

633
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,090
通过放火
By setting it on fire?

634
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,880
嘿 你必须相信我 先知
Hey, you're gonna have to trust me, Prophet.

635
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,470
我们有计划
There's a plan.

636
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,890
为民众守住这座城市的计划
A plan to keep this city for the people

637
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:00,100
并将那些偷走我们岛屿的混蛋们关进去
and lock up those bastards who are stealing our island.

638
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,650
我们正在建造一个新世界
We're building a new world

639
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,520
而那需要先摧毁旧世界
that requires the destruction of the old one.

640
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,280
而且烧毁东西的感觉妙极了
Also, it feels really fucking good to blow shit up.

641
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,320
- 太美妙了 - 可不是
- So fucking good. - Hell yeah.

642
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,830
我们唱和这有关的歌
We sang songs about it.

643
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,040
如果你问的是“小萨会怎么做 ”
If the question you're asking is, "What would Sam do?"

644

我觉得大家都知道答案 小萨曾是我们的一份子
I think we all know the answer. Sam was one of us,

645
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,090
如果你反其道而行 你是无法接近真相
and you're not gonna get closer to the truth of what happened to her

646
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,220
查出她发生了什么
running in the other direction.

647
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:40,640
来吧 查理 加入我们 让小萨看见你的本领
Come on, Charlie. Join us. Show Sam what you're made of.
