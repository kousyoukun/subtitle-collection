1
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:12,012
<i>Something is wrong
with Gizmo lately.</i>

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,752
<i>He's morose, distracted.</i>

3
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:15,406
Like a man with a secret.

4
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:17,713
<i>I mean, he's still
a perfectly adequate familiar.</i>

5
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:20,150
<i>But there's just something
not right about him.</i>

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,152
<i>What it is, I don't know,</i>

7
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:23,675
<i>but I intend to find out.</i>

8
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:25,503
So we're all here.
That's good.

9
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:27,984
- If I can have
your undivided attention
-  What?

10
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:29,855
- for a few minutes?
- Absolutely not.
-  No.

11
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:32,380
So, aren't you
actually a vampire now?

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,512
- Hmm?
- Didn't you pay
your friend Derek

13
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:37,167
- to turn you into a--
- We're not talking
about that right now.

14
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:38,864
<i>He's behaving unusually.</i>

15
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,214
If there's anyone that can get

16
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:41,345
to the bottom of this
kind of thing, it's me.

17
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:43,260
Why? 'Cause I'm
the king of bottoms.

18
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,658
<i>♪ Don't sing if you want
to live long ♪</i>

19
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:53,009

20

<i>♪ You're dead

26
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:22,082
- As I was saying--
-  Couple of questions.
First one:

27
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,779
- Why? And also,
- Okay, you know what?

28
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:25,694
- who gives you the right?
-  Okay, I was just--

29
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:27,348
I have a follow-up
to that.

30
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:28,479
Okay.

31
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:30,655
Yeah.

32
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:32,744
Nadja, Laszlo,
Colin Robinson, please.

33
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:35,051
I would like to hear
what Guillermo has to say.

34
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:37,619
<i>A lot has changed</i>

35
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,316
<i>since you last saw me.</i>

36
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:41,710
I'm in a really good place.

37
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,234
And it is all thanks
to an ancient book of wisdom

38
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:47,672
<i>I discovered
that laid buried in Laszlo's</i>

39
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:50,719
<i>library of precious volumes
for years and years.</i>

40
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,242
<i>This book has</i>

41
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:54,853
taught me to focus
on what is really important,

42
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:59,684
<i>like who is okay
and who is not okay.</i>

43
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:01,425
Thank you for sharing, Guillermo.

44
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,253
You are okay.

45
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:06,691
- I didn't say anything yet.
- Then that is okay.

46
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:10,042
Okay. I want to talk about
something very important.

47
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:12,001
If this about
my sexual intercourse,

48
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,829
I saw the doctor
and took the test.

49
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:15,570
No, that was a <i>Cosmo</i> quiz
that you took

50
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,920
called "Which <i>Sex and the City</i>
Icon Are You?"

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,965
- And I was Kim Cattrall.
- Ooh.

52
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,184
- Ooh.
-  Now, I haven't
got a clue who

53
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,098
that is,
but as long as she's sexy

54
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:24,013
and down to fuck, bingo.

55
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:26,276
- Fine diagnosis.
-  Okay, the thing
I want to talk about is

56
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:27,625
- vampire safety.
-  Go on.

57
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,105
You're all becoming very sloppy

58
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,672
covering your vampirisms
in public, okay?

59
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:31,847
It's becoming very dangerous.

60
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:33,588
What is the big deal?

61
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,242
If anyone notices,
we just hypnotize them

62
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,634
- like we always do.
-  No,

63
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,201
you've been doing that
way too much lately.

64
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:42,118
Yes, but I have getting
really okay at it.

65
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,903
- You okay?
- I am fine.

66
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:47,210
No, no, no. No, no.

67
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,648
- You will all forget

68
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:54,086
that someone tripped
and who it was.

69
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:56,176
I just fear that
the hypnosis is making

70
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,655
the borough dumber and dumber.

71
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:00,571
We live in Staten Island.
Nobody will notice.

72
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,834
There are just some things
you will never understand

73
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:05,533
- because you're not a vampire.
-  Yeah.

74
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,491
-  Very good point.

75
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:09,189
But even if I was a vampire, I--

76
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:17,501
We are not laughing with you,
we are laughing at you.

77
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,155
You know what?
Enough, okay?

78
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:21,026
Don't count on me to always
be here to protect you.

79
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,985
I'm not gonna be around forever.

80
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:25,248
Really? Where will you go,
David Attenborough?

81
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,293
-  Right now?
- Yes.

82
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:28,338
- Out of this room.
- Oh, finally.

83
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:29,818
And that is okay.

84
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:32,342
Look, guys, please, can I just
have, like, a minute?

85
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,170
Please, can--
You know what, fine.

86
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,345
Fine.
Let's get this over with.

87
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,391
Lock the door.

88
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,522
Lock the--
Please look the door.

89
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,698
So, yeah, 16 days ago,

90
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:43,484
I made an impulsive decision
to have Derek...

91
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:44,659
Make me a vampire.

92
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,008
Sure, man.

93
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,403
- Oh. Whoa. Not yet, sorry.
-  Just a...

94
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:51,840
I know, but just
gonna take my...

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,320
- cardigan off.
- Yeah, of course, of course.

96
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,669
Just don't want anything on it.

97
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,148
- My grandma gave it to me.
- Mm.

98
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,324
<i>And...</i>

99
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:58,760
I was a little nervous at first,

100
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,850
and your first time
I guess always... is?

101
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,722
Uh... Okay.

102
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:05,810
- Here we are.
- Yes.

103
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,942
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

104
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:10,206
I'm ready.

105
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:13,818
-  Derek,

106
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:15,429
customer toilet
is clogged again.

107
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:16,865
You know what?
I got to take care of this.

108
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,040
Wait, what? Now?

109
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,563
If I don't do it now,
people just go

110
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,348
on top of what's already there,
and believe me,

111
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:22,697
- then no one's happy.
- Derek,

112
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:24,655
later.
After...

113
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:25,874
Oh, yes, of course, yes.

114
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,005
You know what?
Trevor's always telling me

115
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,006
I have bad task management

116
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,094
skills, you know?

117
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:31,183
First, turn you into a vampire.

118
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:33,098
- Yes.
- Then I'll clean the toilets.

119
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,883
I'm ready.

120
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:36,319
<i>Derek moved in,</i>

121
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,321
and finally--

122
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,892
What are you doing?

123
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,766
Just... showing off your...
your sound machine.

124
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:50,420
Why do you have it on

125
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,293
"rainy night at
the leaky castle" setting?

126
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,295
- Ah...

127
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,471
The creatures of the night.

128
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,604
Such beautiful music they make.

129
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:04,129
It also has a setting
for "banshee wail"

130
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:07,307
- It's white noise.
- and "abandoned orphanage."

131
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,569
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

132
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,832
- Very creepy.
- Master, is there something that

133
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,703
you needed to discuss with me?

134
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,792
Yes.

135
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,099
There is.

136
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,232
Guillermo...

137
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:23,105
we know why
you have been acting so

138
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:25,237
oddly lately.

139
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:26,891
- You do?
- Mm.

140
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,067
Are you-are you mad?

141
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,721
Yes.

142
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:33,376
We are mad at ourselves

143
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,770
for forgetting your birthday.

144
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,469
I am okay and you are okay,
but this is not okay.

145
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:40,818
<i>For a human,</i>

146
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:43,212
a birthday is a terrible day.

147
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:46,520
- We have forgotten his birthday.
- Oh, yes.

148
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,913
<i>No, I really don't think
it's about his birthday.</i>

149
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:51,394
And if it is, what a bitch.

150
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,962
- When is his birthday?
- Uh...

151
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:55,877
I don't know, to be honest.

152
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,444
<i>Poor creatures
only live for, like,</i>

153
00:05:57,444 --> 00:06:00,316
two, 300 years, tops.

154
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,231
So we are taking you out
for a birthday dinner.

155
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,364
Change into your nicest
shitty sweater

156
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,627
- and we will see you
at the restaurant.
- What...

157
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,455
What restaurant?

158
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:14,156
<i>So, full disclosure:</i>

159
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:17,202
I am back in the workforce.

160
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:21,163
I'm Colin Robinson.
I'll be taking your order today.

161
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:24,384
So, what are we thinking about
munching on?

162
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,517
I decided to take a break
from the office life.

163
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:30,955
How about we set you two up
with some pro-sexy?

164
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:33,828
It's a fun way
of saying prosecco.

165
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,307
- Prosecco is...

166
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:38,354
<i>Simply because
the opportunities to feed</i>

167
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:42,967
in the service industry
are so incredible.

168
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,926
Dressing on the side. Ugh.

169
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:46,797
Uh, I can ask the chef,

170
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:49,017
but it's probably a no go.

171
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,149
- I hate to see you cry.
- I'm not crying.

172
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,629
I just...
I want...

173
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:53,804
Pardon my reach.

174
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,893
Oops.

175
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:57,634
Just wanted to check in
on you two,

176
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,157
see how everything's tasting.

177
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:02,073
Think about desert.

178
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:03,597
- Strip steak.
- Uh-huh.

179
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:04,946
Medium-well.

180
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:08,602
The Caesar salad
but with no croutons.

181
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,865
Are you sure
you're getting all this?

182
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:13,694
Yeah, I-I never
write anything down.

183
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:16,261
I got it.
I think I know you want.

184
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:17,872
Bon appétit.

185
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,528
Hey, folks, my name is Colin.

186
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,878
I'll be your server
this evening.

187
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:25,488
Has your whole party arrived?

188
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:28,970
No. Tonight,
Gizmo arrives upon an Uber.

189
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,755
- Mm-hmm.
-  Okay. They're really
not supposed to

190
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:33,670
seat you until your
entire party has arrived.

191
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,238
Can I ask you to go stand
in the crowded alcove

192
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,109
where the cigarette smoke
comes in?

193
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:40,329
Fuck off.
Just get us anything

194
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,983
so it looks like we're eating.

195
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:44,681
Okey dokey, jalapeño poppers,
jalapeño poppers,

196
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,335
jalapeño poppers,

197
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,642
and one more <i>per la tavola.</i>

198
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:52,036
<i>Koúkla mou,</i> do you want
to come up and join us?

199
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,430
- No, I hate you
and I want to die.

200
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,388
When I was running
the vampire nightclub

201
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,521
I may have got a little bit

202
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,958
too much into the old, uh,

203
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:01,742
<i>liquor blood.</i>

204
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:06,790
And then, one night,
I got so shit off my faced...

205
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,967
...that I sat on my dolly

206
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,448
and I minced her legs
with my wagon.

207
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,058
Don't be such a Debbie Downer.

208
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:17,061
- Come and join in the human
birthday party.
- Yes, eh?

209
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:19,716
What you've done to my legs
is unforgivable.

210
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,284
Nadja absolutely crushed
my lower body.

211
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,851
There's nothing wrong
with my butt.

212
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:26,244
Eh, I'll be the judge of that.

213
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:27,942
<i>And Colin Robinson's solution</i>

214
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:31,075
is something I very much
do not like.

215
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,817
Come on, you can be the queen
of the restaurant, huh?

216
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,079
- Push the button, my darling.
-  Don't you dare

217
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,907
press the button on my toe.

218
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:38,430
Oh, come on, it's so fun.

219
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,084
-<i>♪ I feel good... ♪</i>

220
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:41,303
- No! I don't actually
feel good at all!

221
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,218
<i>♪ I knew that I would, now... ♪</i>

222
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:45,916
I will never forgive you for
destroying my-- <i>♪ I feel good ♪</i>

223
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,615
- Wow! Peekaboo!
Queen of Soul in the house.
-<i>♪ So good... ♪</i>

224
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,573
- Fuck-fuck-fuck you all!
<i>♪ So good ♪</i>
-  I think so.

225
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,314
<i>♪ I got you. ♪</i>
Ow!

226
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:53,881
- Ow! Stop!

227
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,796
Put me back under the table.

228
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:58,276
- Oh, what have I done?
- You know what you did.

229
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,800
You're never
going to forgive me, are you?

230
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:01,802
Colin Robinson.

231
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,325
- Yes, sir?
-  Are those

232
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:06,502
"yalapeño" whatevers--
are they coming any time soon?

233
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:08,417
Oh, I'll ask your server
to check on those.

234
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,636
I thought you were our server.

235
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,159
I'm on break.

236
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,205
- My darling,
what is on your mind?
-  Yes.

237
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,468
It's nothing, I just...

238
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,166
I can't get something
out of my mind that

239
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,168
that little pipsqueak Gizmo
said about

240
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:22,953
not being around forever.

241
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,303
I mean, he could mean
that he's gonna die soon.

242
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,609
- Right.
- That's something that, uh,

243
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,654
- humans do.
-  All the time.

244
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,656
Or he could get his old job

245
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:31,048
at Panera Bread back.

246
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,876
That's another thing
all humans do

247
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:35,096
- at some point. Or...
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

248
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:38,534
I suppose eventually,
perhaps, he could...

249
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,972
...become a vampire himself.

250
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:44,322
- Fuck, no.

251
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:47,587
- What an idiot.
- It could happen.
It could happen.

252
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,980
I don't understand why.
Why do you keep asking that?

253
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,852
You were there,
you saw what happened.

254
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,157
- Why are we going to--
-  Guillermo,
we're just trying to

255
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:55,072
understand it from
your point of view.

256
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:56,508
Derek leaned in...

257
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:57,335
Wait, stop!

258
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,120
- Oh, what?!
- Sorry.

259
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,251
Have you done this before?

260
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,514
Yeah.
Tons of ti--

261
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:03,907
Like, many dozens of times.

262
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:05,169
- Derek.
- I'm-- No.

263
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,476
I haven't. No.
Um, have you?

264
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,653
Why doesn't Andy just do this?

265
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,960
- Who?
- Your master.

266
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:15,484
You mean Nandor?

267
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:17,399
Oh-- Okay.

268
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,401
That clears up so much for me.

269
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:20,707
I mean, I kept thinking,

270
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:23,013
"A vampire named Andy?
That's so random."

271
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:24,275
It's not like
he doesn't want to.

272
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,537
It's, like, he always says

273
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:27,670
he's gonna get around
to it, you know?

274
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,498
He actually cares
about me a lot,

275
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:30,673
and he does a lot of

276
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:33,284
- really nice things for me.
- Oh.

277
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:38,899
Oh, sorry, I'm just pausing.

278
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,465
It's for the editors.

279
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,032
They insert, probably, like,
a cute montage or something,

280
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:43,817
of all the stuff
he's done for me

281
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:46,733
- over the years,
so, might take a second.
- Okay.

282
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,995
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

283
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,568
Are you sure
you want to do this?

284
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:58,092
Yes.

285
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,094
No, I still absolutely
want to be a vampire.

286
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,312
I just didn't think it would

287
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:03,184
- happen like this.
- Mm.

288
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,273
I don't know, maybe it's, like,
deep down inside,

289
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:06,796
my psyche is just
telling me that

290
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:09,538
I'm really not ready to, like--

291
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,932
Oh, shit!
What the fuck are you doing?!

292
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,891
- Oh, oh, oh.

293
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,284
I'm sorry, I-I thought
you said you were ready.

294
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,851
I wasn't ready!

295
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,374
I heard "ready!"
I just heard "ready!"

296
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:20,636
I think he hit an artery.

297
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:21,724
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

298
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:22,986
<i>!¡Puta madre!</i>

299
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:24,814
Oh!

300
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,034
And it was just like...

301
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:30,733
Aah! Fucking shit! Oh!

302
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,735
Be honest with me. Is it bad?

303
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,736
Hold still, let me look.

304
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,346
Uh, yeah, it's bad.

305
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:37,914
- Oh! <i>!¡Puta madre!</i>

306
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,176
Okay, I got to drink your blood.

307
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:41,222
Ooh. That is gonna be
a sticking point for me.

308
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:43,224
- Why is that?
- Because I'm a bit of a fainter.

309
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:45,269
- I have low blood pressure.
- What?

310
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:48,403
If I'm being honest, you people
can be real parasites.

311
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,013
I mean, why do I need
to repeat myself?

312
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,754
You were there,
you saw the blood.

313
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:54,148
- Thank you so much, and
I will be giving you five stars.
- Yeah.

314
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:55,758
And you know what? I'm done.
I'm off to my birthday dinner

315
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:57,020
when it's not really
my birthday.

316
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,239
<i>Imagine Guillermo</i>

317
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:01,633
flying around
in his little short legs.

318
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,940
- I enjoy that joke.
- That's made my night.

319
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,812
What's so funny?
What'd I miss?

320
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:07,988
Hey, gang.

321
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:11,469
Hi. Do you mind if I borrow?
Thank you so much.

322
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:13,645
- That's me.
- What's so funny?

323
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,256
Oh, nothing.

324
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,953
We were doing the joke
where we imagine

325
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:19,477
that you have become a vampire.

326
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:22,654
I don't know why
that's so laughable.

327
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:25,092
- Could you imagine
Grahame as a vampire?
- I know!

328
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,964
He would be just a little bat
with diarrhea, like...

329
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,966
Flying and then...

330
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:32,142
Why do I always shit
in your scenarios?

331
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:33,970
Guillermo, I'm sorry.
Eventually, of course,

332
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,668
I will definitely be
turning you into a vampire

333
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,148
when the time is right.

334
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:39,802
But you got to admit,
it's a funny image.

335
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,501
With the big glasses.

336
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,721
Or a shitty woolen cape.

337
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,157
What if-what if I didn't wait

338
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,116
till I felt like you thought
the time was right?

339
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:51,161
-  What do you mean?
-  What if, hypothetically,

340
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,642
walking down the street,
and then Dracula--

341
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:56,514
- Dracula?
-  He says,

342
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:59,126
"Do you want me to make you
into a vampire?"

343
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,824
And I said yes?

344
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:12,661
A familiar going to a vampire
who is not his master

345
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,663
and asking him to turn him?

346
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:17,622
Now, I am a fan of edgy comedy,

347
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:20,190
but that is no laughing matter.

348
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,626
I'm not entirely sure
we should be

349
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:24,151
talking about any of this
out loud.

350
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,152
But it's okay.

351
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:26,457
I was just saying hypothetically.

352
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:27,458
Hypothetically,

353
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,764
what you are talking about

354
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,853
is the greatest humiliation

355
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:34,161
a familiar could bestow
upon his master.

356
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:37,686
If that were to happen, Guillermo...

357
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,343
...then I will kill you.

358
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,738
I would not like to do it,
but I would have to do it.

359
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,523
And then I would kill myself,

360
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,786
which I would not like either.

361
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:53,528
There are some things
about which

362
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,747
we do not joke.

363
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,053
Obee-kaybee.

364
00:13:57,053 --> 00:14:00,840
I have six plates
of veggie dumplings

365
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,363
and a chocolate pudding.

366
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:05,192
-  That looks...
-  Mm, brown.

367
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,411
- Thank you.
-  ...like shit.

368
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:14,984
Well, it was a nice dinner,
so you have had a happy birthday

369
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,073
to distract you from the fact
you will soon die.

370
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,119
- You are welcome.
- Hear, hear. Well said.

371
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,164
And, for your birthday wish,

372
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:23,732
we all promise
to do a much better job

373
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:25,777
of blending in,
as you requested.

374
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,910
I guess I'll see you
back at the hou--

375
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,956
Okay. I'm just gonna
get some stuff at the mall.

376
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:33,611
What is "mawrl?"

377
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,180
-  [gasps] I have heard
-  Oh, ho!

378
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,314
about this thing called mall.

379
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:43,534
But I thought
it was a myth, a rumor,

380
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:47,016
a fairy tale made up
by an insane child.

381
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,366
- This, I have to see.
-  Maybe I shouldn't

382
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:50,802
have mentioned anything
about the mall. That's on me.

383
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,195
I take responsibility for that.

384
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:55,546
Okay, this is the mall.

385
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:59,376
Just sit down and people-watch,
do whatever you want

386
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:00,725
while sitting down.

387
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:02,989
I'm gonna get some new glasses
and a footlocker

388
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,947
- and then we can go home.
- It is rising!

389
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:05,948
-  That's an elevator.
- Ah.

390
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,558
So just stay here.

391
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:10,083
- Great.
- Yes, we understand.
-  Okay, great.

392
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,085
- I'll be right back.
-  All right. Yeah.

393
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:13,303
I'm gonna get you
some new knickers.

394
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,914
What is Sephora?

395
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,569
Gilly's Gifts. Very nice.

396
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,050
This mall has
a Guillermo's Gifts?

397
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,922
Uh, I'm not sure.

398
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,489
That is fine.
I will explore.

399
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:28,928
I would like you to tell me
more about this product.

400
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,104
-  Well, that's Shrek.
- Great.

401
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:32,148
Ring me up.

402
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,802
And also...

403
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:36,892
I would like you to honor
these special coupons.

404
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,981
I will honor this coupon

405
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,765
for a free oil change

406
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:43,899
that expired 18 years ago,

407
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:46,075
- Yes.
- and this one that's

408
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:50,253
just a cut-out photo of
Ryan Seacrest from a magazine.

409
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:54,040
- Will it work?
- Yes, of course it will work.

410
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,217
We are going to fix this,
and this is how we do it.

411
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:58,958
Sorry about that.

412
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,960
- So, did we make a selection?
- Yes.

413
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,745
I am looking for
the exact proportions of

414
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:07,227
Venus herself when her pussy
was serving witches tea,

415
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,925
nipples so sharp they're on
the most wanted list,

416
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:12,406
and a taint that can sign
its own checks.

417
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:16,758
Uh... I meant more like,
which hat did you want?

418
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:20,066
Oh, yes.
Rainbow sombrero for sure.

419
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,241
-  Okay.

420
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,591
- What is wrong now?

421
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:26,594
You didn't even
ask for my opinion.

422
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,117
What the hell are you
talking about?

423
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:30,685
Did you not hear
what I said about the taint?

424
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:33,514
Malls are fascinating places
full of fascinating things.

425
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,691
That's a baby village.

426
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:38,432
Makes sense to keep them all
in one place.

427
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:39,650
That's called London Shoes.

428
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,826
Now, if those shoes
were really from London,

429
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:43,306
they'd be covered in shit.

430
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:45,047
Bikini Warehouse.

431
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,745
- Must be a front for a brothel.
-  Excuse me.

432
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:50,487
- Hi. Would you like to sample
our new scent, Noir?
- No, fuck off.

433
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,186
Can't be sidetracked
with cheap sex potions.

434
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,839
Question still remains.

435
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,537
What is Gizmo up to?

436
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:07,678
Hyah!

437
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:10,420
Prepare to be pillaged!

438
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,509
- Laszlo!
- Shut up.

439
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,163
- I found John!
- Idiot.

440
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,469
-  It's John!
- Fucking idiot.

441
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:19,081
Make this thing go faster!

442
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:22,084
That was, uh, some pretty
heavy stuff at dinner, huh?

443
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:26,567
Just stuff I did not even,
I didn't even...

444
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,004
...know.

445
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,486
Sorry.

446
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,315
Where was I? Um...

447
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:37,882
I was hemorrhaging profusely,
uh, about to die.

448
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:40,189
- You good?
-  Yeah.

449
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,930
- Yeah, I think so.
- Well, that's good.

450
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,237
- 'Cause I haven't done it yet.
- Oh, dude.

451
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:45,934
Other people's blood
I'm fine with.

452
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,067
But the sight of my own?
No, thank you.

453
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,503
You know, when I think
about fainting, I faint.

454
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,724
It's really hard
to break the skin.

455
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,552
- Um...
- I'm running out of time
here, buddy.

456
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:57,728
Here. Why don't you slice me up
with this box cutter?

457
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,295
Are you sure?
It's gonna hurt.

458
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,863
- I'm a vampire.
I think I can handle it.
- Okay.

459
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:05,954
- Did you do it?
- Yeah, I did.

460
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,173
- But don't look because--
- Don't look at what?

461
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,391
- Oh, shit.
- No, Derek.

462
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,740
No.

463
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:18,706
The deed is done.
The die is cast.

464
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,316
There's no turning--

465
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:33,416
Derek. Toilet again.

466
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:36,332
Oh...

467
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:38,029
Okay, sorry, dude,
I got to go take care of this.

468
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:40,336
Oh, shit. Dude?

469
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,947
- Dude?

470
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,215
So, yeah.

471
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,305
That's where we're at.

472
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:56,047
<i>It seems to be</i>

473
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,571
a process.

474
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:01,227
I thought the transformation
would be faster,

475
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,403
but I haven't drank blood.

476
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,100
I can still eat human foods.

477
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,799
<i>In fact, my appetite
for very rare meat is ravenous.</i>

478
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,414
<i>My teeth are
totally normal and...</i>

479
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,720
I don't feel any sexier.

480
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,766
<i>I can still go out into the sun.</i>

481
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,901
I can't fly or turn into a bat.

482
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:24,902
<i>Yet.</i>

483
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,556
Bat!

484
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:27,905
Human form.

485
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:29,211
<i>I thought the transformation</i>

486
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:32,562
would be overnight,
but it's been 16 days.

487
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:34,608
Which is why I've been
keeping it a secret.

488
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,350
<i>I was kind of holding off
for that big</i>

489
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,439
"wow factor" for the reveal,
but at this point,

490
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,092
I don't even think
I should tell them because--

491
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,443
-  Mr. de la Corz?
- Uh, so sorry about that.

492
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:44,618
De la Cruz? That's me.

493
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:45,880
- De la Cruz.
- Hi.

494
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,403
How long have you been
wearing glasses

495
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:48,709
with this prescription?

496
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,319
Oh, since I was three or four?

497
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,668
I-I don't know
who screwed up here,

498
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:54,802
but you actually
don't need glasses at all.

499
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:56,586
According to the eye exam
you just did,

500
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:58,545
you have 20/20 vision.

501
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:00,242
It's actually better than
20/20 vision.

502
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,765
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

503
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:03,941
Well, that is...

504
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:06,683
a super power.

505
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:09,338
- Wow, that's... Wow.
- So, right now, you're wearing

506
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:11,601
a very strong prescription
for no reason.

507
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:12,950
- Let's stop doing that.
- Let's stop doing that.

508
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,125
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

509
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,302
Would it be possible
to just get a pair

510
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:18,042
without a prescription?

511
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,261
Just, I don't want
people to think

512
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,221
I look... different.

513
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,919
Uh, yeah. Sure.
You want the same frames or...

514
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,100
<i>Did you enjoy your birthday?</i>

515
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,015
It was all right, Master.

516
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:35,408
I guess I wasn't really
that hungry.

517
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:37,540
And that is okay.

518
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,889
Do the other side.

519
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:41,283
- Master?
- Mm-hmm?

520
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,459
If I accidentally

521
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,722
got made into a vampire...

522
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:46,984
- Mm-hmm?
- by somebody else,

523
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:48,508
you wouldn't really...

524
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,249
kill me, would you?

525
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,252
Accidentally, you say?

526
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:57,952
- Yes.
- Not intentionally?

527
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:02,130
No, I guess... not.

528
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,525
I'd still have to kill you.
What choice would I have?

529
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:09,093
What about "vampire shall not
kill other vampire"?

530
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:11,139
Guillermo, I don't like

531
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,359
hypothetical brain-ticklers
before bedtime.

532
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,099
- You know this.
- Right.

533
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:17,101
Makes my head heat up.

534
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:21,802
How's about
a nice bedtime story?

535
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:25,371
Okay. I did see
this very interesting movie

536
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:26,633
the other night.

537
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:29,549
- Oh, tell me.
- It was about this guy.

538
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:32,073
- And he got turned
into a vampire.

539
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:33,596
- Really?
- Yeah.

540
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:35,250
But then he realizes that maybe

541
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,775
he wasn't ready
to be turned into a vampire.

542
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,037
Why not?

543
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,953
He had his reasons.
But then

544
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,520
he tries to find a way to

545
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,740
stop the process of becoming
a vampire and rever--

546
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,002
Guillermo, please.

547
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:50,700
I don't like
science-fiction stories

548
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,528
before bedtime either.

549
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:55,662
- Yeah.
- That reminds me.

550
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:57,664
I got you a birthday present.

551
00:21:57,664 --> 00:22:00,231
I heard you when you said
you wanted a footlocker.

552
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:02,146
So I got you

553
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:04,671
a footlocker.

554
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:06,716
-  Thank you, Master.
- Yes.

555
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:09,719
You are welcome.
Close the lid.

556
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:22,776

00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,386
