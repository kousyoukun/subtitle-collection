00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,827
We have received this letter.

163
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,396
From Baron... Afanas.

164
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:41,618
Really?

165
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:44,316
Yes.

166
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,666
NANDOR:
How do you...

167
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:48,103
-GUILLERMO: Like that.
-Shh.

168
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:49,583
The Baron...

169
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,891
...is coming to visit us.

170
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:55,719
Holy shit.

171
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:56,938
Silence, Guillermo.

172
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,461
Vampire comments only.

173
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,028
The Baron never leaves
the old country.

174
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:02,639
Has he told us what the purposeof his visit is?

175
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:06,034
Uh...

176
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:07,688
No.

177
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,298
LASZLO:
The Baron is a firm believer

178
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,300
that vampires should rule
the world.

179
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:13,911
I think the main purpose
for the Baron's visit

180
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:16,305
is to find out whether
we as vampires

181
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,611
have populated America.

182
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:19,743
But as you can see,

183
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,745
the place is fucking massive.

184
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,617
When is he coming, exactly?

185
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,575
-Tomorrow.
-Shit.

186
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:26,750
NANDOR:
Why didn't you give this
to me earlier?

187
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:28,491
It arrived this morning, Master.

188
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:29,840
[hisses]

189
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:30,972
NADJA:
Baron Afanas is...

190
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:34,758
a very charming member
of the vampire royalty.

191
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:36,368
A few hundred years ago,

192
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:39,371
we enjoyed a very intense,
very long sexual affair.

193
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:40,503
It was pretty wild.

194
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,592
Lots of acrobatic stuff.

195
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:43,941
This could make it awkward,

196
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:46,901
to see him with Laszlo...

197
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,729
present.

198
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:50,774
LASZLO:
Just between you and I,

199
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:52,776
a while back, the Baron and I

200
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,431
enjoyed a very intense
sex affair.

201
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,651
Very animalistic.

202
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,304
Acrobatic stuff, you might say.

203
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:00,567
So I, personally,

204
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,005
am very much looking forward
to reconnecting.

205
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:06,398
We should get a chariot led by

206
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,923
12 black alligators.

207
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,881
-I like that.
-That's a lot of alligators,

208
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:11,969
a lot of paint.

209
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,580
What about a van?

210
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:15,669
A van? [groans]

211
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:16,583
That's not the same, is it?

212
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,323
Can you at least make sure
it's black?

213
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:21,370
Yeah. Black van for tomorrow?

214
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:24,678
Excellent. Uh, what about
the Baron's bloodlust?

215
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,549
-Virgins.
-Oh, yes, let's do that.

216
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,551
Guillermo, two virgins
by tomorrow evening.

217
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,597
-[Nadja chuckling]
-Yes, when the Baron arrives

218
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,599
we shall feast on virgin blood.

219
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:33,904
[both cackling]

220
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,603
[vampires laughing]

221
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,562
[Guillermo chuckling]

222
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:42,260
Vampire only laughing.

223
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:43,784
-Should we tell Colin Robinson?-Laszlo,

224
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,699
-that is a terrible idea.
-[Laszlo clears throat]

225
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,701
He'll ruin the evening.

226
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:48,963
Uh, what would ruin the evening?

227
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,574
I told you-- didn't close
the door properly.

228
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:54,882
Are we having a house meeting?

229
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,973
-No.
-No.

230
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:01,410
So, your gathering here...

231
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,586
is just a coincidence?

232
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,457
Yes.

233
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,678
COLIN:
My name is Colin Robinson.

234
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,680
And I am what's known as

235
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,595
a psychic vampire.

236
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,379
Or energy vampire.

237
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,033
This is my office.

238
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:18,470
Also known
as the hunting ground.

239
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:20,516
Hi, Deb.

240
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,040
Energy vampires drain
people's energy

241
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,651
merely by talking to them.

242
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:27,741
Actual v. Budget,
year-to-date, no thanks.

243
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:28,959
You're gonna be at that all day.

244
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,961
We either bore you

245
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,963
with a long conversation...

246
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:35,531
Feeling better now, I was
a little sick this weekend.

247
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,272
[inhales sharply]

248
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:38,969
Hey, Don.

249
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,405
Don?

250
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,016
I have to pee, too.

251
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,278
Or...

252
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,322
Hey.

253
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,323
...we enrage you.

254
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,325
[sharpener whining, whirring]

255
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:50,633
In fact, you probably know
an energy vampire.

256
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,504
We're the most common kind...

257
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,289
of vampire.

258
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:55,856
[sharpener screeching, whirring]

259
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,467
We are day-walkers,
not affected by the sun.

260
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,425
[sharpener screeching]

261
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:03,690
And we are
the only kind of vampire

262
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,693
that can drain
another vampire's energy.

263
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,478
It's very cool.

264
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,875
The power grows stronger
in him by the night.

265
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:17,529
[snoring]

266
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:23,710
GUILLERMO: There's different kinds of jobs that I have to do.

267
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:26,930
Keep the house tidy.

268
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,149
Make sure there's no sunlight.

269
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,717
["Danse Macabre"
by Saint-Saens playing]

270
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,284
[mimicking Nandor]:
Sunlight! Why, Guillermo,

271
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:37,114
why?!

272
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,683
Not on my watch.

273
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,685
Getting rid of carcasses,

274
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,774
I feel, is a big one.

275
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,347
So, we are under the stairs
and this is my bedroom.

276
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,696
[chuckles softly]

277
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,612
This is a picture of me
as Armand

278
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,570
from Interview with the Vampire.

279
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,572
Played by Antonio Banderas.

280
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,966
That was the first time
I've ever seen

281
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,838
an Hispanic vampire

282
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:08,145
in mainstream, like, movies.

283
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:11,105
And I said,
"If he can do it, I-I...

284
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:12,715
[scoffs] I can do it."

285
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,848
Guillermo... boarded
this whole window up,

286
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,719
it's a huge sunlight risk.

287
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,329
We wouldn't want the Baron
waking up to sunlight

288
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,331
and being turned into
barbecue meat.

289
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,333
Yeah, really cover it.

290
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:23,944
He's made a lot of comments
recently, like,

291
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,381
"I'm going to make you
a vampire."

292
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:29,210
This is a little coffin toy
that, uh...

293
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:31,865
I hope to be
in one of these one day.

294
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,910
What ho, good friends.

295
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:35,607
LARPERS:
What ho!

296
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:38,915
There's still a few places
to find virgins.

297

LARPing stands for

In regular life,
I'm just Jonathan.

299
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,968
But here, I am
a very high-level paladin.

300
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,012
GUILLERMO:
I'm not a killer.

301
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:52,015
I find people who are easy...

302
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,539
to... kill.

303
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,019
Is that a 14th-century
battle-ax?

304

Oh, it's so exciting.

305
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,675
Uh, will we be able
to touch the swords?

306
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,809
Oh, you'll touch the swords.

307

NADJA:
We moved here from Europe

308
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:09,337
about 200 years ago
because there was

309
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,906
a lot of prejudice  against vampires at that time.

310

-[explosions, gunfire]
-[man groans]

312
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:19,260
They don't like
the color of our skin.

313
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,784
Or the fact that
we killed and ate people.

314
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,787
Probably more that.

315
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:27,834
LASZLO:
We're being very careful
not to stand out,

316
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,836
which is why
we're both dressed down.

317
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,839
-Uh, good evening.
-Go back to your own country.

318
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:34,797
What the fuck did you just say?

319
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,625
You heard me,
Ghost of Christmas Past bitch.

320
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:37,974
Oh, Mike, shut up.

321
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:40,890
Silence to you.
We've been here since 1861.

322
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:44,198
At least, our families have.

323
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,982
Begone.

324
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:48,289
We should just suck their blood,I'm absolutely starving.

325

He doesn't see me, though,
because I sneak behind him.

I watch him in the night,

In the old country,
centuries ago,

I was in a very passionate

with a human man called Gregor.

He was a knight.

He got decapitated
in battle.

I don't think I ever really
got over Gregor.

Even when I met Laszlo.

I think it is him.
