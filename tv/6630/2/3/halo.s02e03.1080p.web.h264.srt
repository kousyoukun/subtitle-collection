1
00:00:02,045 --> 00:00:03,699
- [士兵尖叫] - [戏剧性音乐]

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:04,787
- [枪声] - [士兵尖叫]

3
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:06,963
[剑呼啸]

4
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,794
我在庇护所看到了马克。

5
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:13,361
- 梅基死了。- 我知道。

6
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:15,319
我亲自开枪打死了她。

7
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:17,452
[Ackerson]你对庇护所事件的描述

8
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,280
已被证明是可疑的。

9
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:22,152
我知道你们这些混蛋是怎么想的。我曾经是你。

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,112
还有其他的事情要做，还有其他的生活方式。

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,201
- [Riz 咕哝] - [John] 你别放弃。

12
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,159
起床。

13
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:31,292
我知道凯瑟琳·哈尔西的位置。

14
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,989
对你来说这不是钱的问题，不是吗？

15
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,383
是关于她对你做了什么。

16
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,820
索伦永远不会抛下你们任何一个人。

17
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:40,170
[艾克森]你被捕了。

18
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:41,867
[女]鲁比·安买下了索伦的船员。

19
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:43,652
[凯斯勒] 当我爸爸回来时，他会保护我们。

20
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,698
他不会回来了！

21
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:49,310
我想向你介绍一个人。

22
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:52,095
这是朱莉娅。她将成为你的侍从。

23
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:53,227
她在哪？

24
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:55,490
科塔娜，她很安全。

25
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:58,754
我给你的问题你有进展吗？

26
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,409
我所有的模拟都返回相同的结果，

27
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:03,976
无论采取任何行动。

28
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,022
所以没什么可做的。

29
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,719
我正在扫描乐队，

30
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:10,418
我在干扰中听到了一些声音。

31
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:11,506
[精英怒吼]

32
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:12,942
[约翰]你听到一条消息。

33
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,639
这种情况还会再次发生。

34
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,119
我要你贴出你的证据

35
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,165
公约的其他活动。

36
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:20,210
按下按钮，我会找到你。

37
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:22,256
这个新人，他带领我们护送一支技术团队

38
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:24,214
执行一些修复任务。

39
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,694
如果您要将 Cobalt 发送到另一个通信阵列，

40
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:27,913
你最好告诉他们期待圣约的到来。

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,959
我无法授权银牌团队

42
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:31,569
执行战斗行动。

43
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:34,094
[电脑蜂鸣声]

44
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,487
[火箭呼啸]

45
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:39,142
- 我们已经准备好战斗了吗？- 是的。

46
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:42,928
[凯] 任务到底是什么？

47
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,497
圣约即将到来。

48
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:48,108
[尖叫]

49
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,979
- [门猛然打开] - [险恶的声音]

50
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,205
[风呼啸]

51
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,257
点击七次即可定位。

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,175
[微弱的嘎吱声]

53
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,092
米？

54
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,442
[Riz]钴三号，罗密欧，这是银三号，结束了。

55
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,357
[静电噼啪声]

56
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,490
任何钴元素，这就是银三。

57
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:24,796
我们正在前往您所在位置的途中，如何抄送？

58
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:29,236
- [静电爆裂声] - [约翰]尝试继电器。

59
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:31,368
[Riz]维谢格拉德接力赛，这是银三。

60
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:34,284
- 无线电检查，结束。 - [静电噼啪声]

61
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,938
[Kai] 我们为此获得空中支援？

62
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,461
[Riz]维谢格拉德接力赛，这是银三。

63
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:38,810
[凯] 大家都在哪里？

64
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,465
- 超过。 - 我们只能靠自己了

65
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:43,859
舰队司令部不相信星盟人在致远星。

66
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,209
他们只是认为钴不见了。

67
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:48,037
这是一次搜救任务

68
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:50,039
但我们需要为这种可能性做好准备

69
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,649
Cobalt 遇到了一些事情。

70
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:54,086
[是]有什么契约吗？

71
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,524
[约翰]指挥部认为这个星球是不可触及的。

72
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,613
他们没有看到我们所看到的，

73
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,745
他们不知道我们所知道的。

74
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:03,183
我会告诉你这一点，我们会联系的。

75
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,447
到那时，就只有我们了。

76
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:11,234
[凯] 这对你来说似乎是正确的？

77
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,454
[有轻微的咕哝声]

78
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:31,298
[静电噼啪声]

79
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:47,488
[阴郁的合唱音乐]

80
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,765
[静电噼啪声]

81
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:50,812
[手指敲击]

82
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,950
[关上门]

83
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:02,258
[脚步声]

84
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,491
[遥远的、回响的叮当声]

85
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,495
[叮当作响的脚步声]

86
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,457
[约翰] 看看你是否能通电。

87
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,632
[Riz] 收到，长官。

88
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:36,553
[有] 匆匆离开。

89
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,209
没有钴的迹象，也没有缺口痕迹——

90
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:42,907
[脉冲声]

91
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,607
[静电噼啪声]

92
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:53,701
[乱码]

93
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,401
[雷鸣般的隆隆声]

94
00:05:58,488 --> 00:05:59,794
[突然沉默]

95
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,796
[凯] 那到底是什么？

96
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:03,624
[Riz] 我不知道，我从来没有听说过这样的事。

97
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:06,975
[约翰] 我有，在庇护所。

98
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:11,153
[沉重的叮当声]

99
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,592
[不断敲门]

100
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,942
[Vannak] 你现在相信他了吗？

101
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,988
[持续稳定的撞击]

102
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:30,433
[手指敲击]

103
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:38,093
[持续稳定的撞击]

104
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:47,102
[手指敲击；远处的敲打]

105
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,322
[静电噼啪声]

106
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,461
[稳定的冲击力；附近静电爆裂声]

107
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:04,946
[音频失真]

108
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,348
[布里格斯]站住！

109
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,003
告诉你的团队放下武器，士官长。

110
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,744
[有]这是什么？

111
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,703
- 酋长？- 现在。

112
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,228
我什至无法描述你的处境有多糟糕。

113
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:27,490
[凯]我什至无法描述

114
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,144
你的脸上将会发生什么。

115
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,450
[Vannak] 这些人到底是谁？

116
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,190
我携带来自舰队司令部的优先命令。

117
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,583
- 什么命令？- 带你进来。

118
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,456
[约翰]你妨碍了我的使命，走开。

119
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,327
没有使命。

120
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,895
- 你偷了一只秃鹰。- 什么？

121
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:43,245
- 伪造飞行计划。- 她在说什么？

122
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:45,421
你现在甚至没有被授权穿那些套装

123
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,162
更不用说拿枪指着我的脸了。

124
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,252
因此，请退下，否则我们将与您接触。

125
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,296
[Riz] 祝你好运。

126
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,733
[有]组长，我们该怎么办？

127
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:56,954
[约翰]钴队在哪里？

128
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,261
- 最后的机会。- 约翰。

129
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,263
[约翰]告诉我钴在哪里，否则我就穿过那扇门。

130
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,134
[布里格斯]我给了你命令。

131
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,571
[有] 叫什么？

132
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,269
首席？

133
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:09,532
[不断敲门]

134
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,669
[布里格斯]啊，退下，别开火！

135
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,543
- 酋长。- 他们在这里。

136
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:22,893
我可以证明这一点。

137
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,765
[凯叹气]

138
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:28,420
[凯]不是这样的。

139
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,858
[忧郁的音乐]

140
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,648
我们在一千英尺高的地方，

141
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:42,260
风在抽打，电缆在呻吟。

142
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:44,349
那里的温度不可能超过两度。

143
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:48,397
- 一月，你知道吗？- 是的。

144
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,965
我再也坚持不住了。

145
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,968
我被绑在安全带上，低头看去，

146
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:56,536
我告诉亚瑟，我说，“我得走了。”

147
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:59,190
[笑]他要做什么？

148
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,496
你尿在亚瑟叔叔身上了？

149
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,978
我尿在他身上了 他能做什么呢？

150
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:06,720
好吧，抬起你的下巴，是的。

151
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,204
你到底怎么了？

152
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,032
这狗屎很有趣。

153
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,251
嗯，我以前听说过。

154
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,035
这有什么区别呢？

155
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:22,431
当我重复我的话时，你应该笑得很开心。

156
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:24,346
我就是那个老了的人。

157
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,782
我不知道你在抱怨什么。

158
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,044
我没有抱怨。

159
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,134
嗯，我的意思是，你愿意。

160
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,484
它是什么？

161
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,704
你的秘密在我这里很安全。

162
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,707
这是关于那件事吗

163
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,231
你不应该告诉我吗？

164
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:42,016
你不应该记得。

165
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,888
我不会选择我忘记的东西。

166
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:49,110
我可能不得不离开。

167
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,374
在哪里？

168
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:55,899
而且我不能带你一起去。

169
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,771
[忧郁的音乐]

170
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,907
- 我知道。- 我想要，但我不能。

171
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:08,564
你看到那座桥了吗？

172
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,957
[艾克森]我无法阻止，爸爸。

173
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,480
你知道那座桥是谁建的吗？

174
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,700
这不取决于我。

175
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,440
- 太晚了。- 那座桥是我建的。

176
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:18,879
我和你的亚瑟叔叔。

177
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,794
完工那天，

178
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:25,059
我和你妈妈还有你姐姐一起走过它。

179
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,845
她不可能超过3岁。

180
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,414
握住了她的小手。

181
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:33,850
她不让我去接她。

182
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:37,811
她想走完全程。

183
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,553
是的。[笑声]

184
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,686
好的。

185
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:45,209
那么她什么时候来？

186
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,212
你妹妹。

187
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,827
她走了，爸爸。

188
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,221
朱莉娅走了。

189
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:58,919
妈妈也是。

190
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:05,229
哦。

191
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:08,885
- 只有你和我。- 我知道。

192
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,234
我非常清楚这一点。

193
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:12,236
别以为我不知道这一点。

194
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:17,981
哦对不起。

195
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,156
[艾克森]没关系。

196
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:26,033
对不起，我只是，对不起，我有时会感到困惑。

197
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,861
没关系。

198
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:34,737
并不意味着我不知道什么是真实的。

199
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:41,004
明天见，好吗？

200
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:41,831
好的。

201
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,271
- 答应我... - 是的，我保证。

202
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:51,275
不，答应我，你不会让他们活捉我。

203
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,850
[凯斯]未经许可缺席，

204
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:03,418
未经授权部署武器系统，

205
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:06,421
违反、

206
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:09,337
我的意思是，你管什么叫偷他妈的秃鹰？

207
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:10,817
先生。

208
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:13,428
我正在查看 15 起 UCMJ 违规行为，

209
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,517
其中之一涉及指向已上膛的武器

210
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:16,561
当着军官的面？

211
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:17,649
我就是这么做的，先生。

212
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,521
先生，我有可靠的信息。

213
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:23,525
你有一种感觉。你有错觉。

214
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,746
你走出了链条。

215
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:29,487
不是吗？

216
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,318
是的先生。

217
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,497
立即生效，

218
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:41,543
白银队被暂停参加战斗行动，

219
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,674
直至另行通知。

220
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,720
凯斯海军上将，我知道——

221
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:48,463
你什么都不知道，因为知道不是你的工作。

222
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,769
这是我的。

223
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,466
你的工作就是服从命令。

224
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,816
钴在维谢格拉德，长官。

225
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:00,867
那是什么？

226
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:05,480
四天前，Cobalt 被部署到 Aktis IV。

227
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,964
不，这是不对的。

228
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,619
我看到了钴的飞行计划。

229
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,665
- [他们是] 酋长。- 我看到了。

230
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,275
他们改变了它！

231
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:21,061
[忧郁的音乐]

232
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,066
我知道我看到了什么。

233
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:33,508
John-117 被解除现役，

234
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,292
并将被限制在军营内

235
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:38,513
直到他通过精神病学评估。

236
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,036
一个什么？

237
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:41,733
117 将接受神经化学检查——

238
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,431
这是你，还是艾克森？

239
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,085
约翰，停下来。

240
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,652
收起你的西装，解雇。

241
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,572
你甚至试图保护我们吗？

242
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,098
我是你没有面临军事法庭的唯一原因

243
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,540
你对我们撒谎了。

244
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,324
我告诉了你完成任务需要知道的事情。

245
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:10,284
- 没有任务。- 钴在维谢格拉德。

246
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,938
- 队长，我可以和你谈谈吗？- 这就是 ONI，这一切。

247
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,505
- 这是艾克森。- 来吧，酋长。

248
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,203
- 你认为他为什么在这里？- 我不能听这个。

249
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,987
你觉得你正在去往哪里？

250
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,946
是！

251
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,948
- 你失控了。- 什么？

252
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,645
你的思维不清晰，你的思维飘忽不定。

253
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:26,343
你从什么时候开始质疑我的判断了？

254
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,260
自从你开始见到死人。

255
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:33,960
我没有告诉任何人你说你在庇护所看到了玛基。

256
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:38,051
约翰，我正在努力帮助你。

257
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,401
我想以你的朋友的身份与你交谈。

258
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:44,622
我不需要朋友，中士，我需要一个斯巴达战士。

259
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,015
你为什么不尝试这样做呢？

260
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,673
125，你没有被解雇！

261
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,284
[忧郁的音乐]

262
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,948
[模糊的喋喋不休]

263
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,604
[男人] 嘿！

264
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,525
[液体咕噜声]

265
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:20,876
[悬疑音乐]

266
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:30,407
【人】她是谁？

267
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,148
[莱拉喘息]

268
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:33,845
[两人都咕哝着]

269
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,196
[刀声]

270
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:38,502
- [刀子叮当声] - [莱拉咳嗽]

271
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,201
[莱拉气喘吁吁]

272
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:43,855
- 鸡蛋？- 嘘！

273
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,554
[附近的声音]

274
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,818
你在做什么？

275
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,428
- 你有危险了。- 我理解了。

276
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:52,864
不是来自鲁比·安。

277
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,866
我说的是你的船员。

278
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,564
[诡异的音乐]

279
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:58,958
鲁比·安买下了他们。

280
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,003
- 他们摆脱了索伦。- 什么？

281
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,787
- 你是下一个。- 什么？

282
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:06,966
- 索伦是吗—— - 我不知道。

283
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,794
你必须带凯斯勒走。

284
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:13,885
【模仿枪声】

285
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:22,416
- 来吧，伙计，我找到你了。- 没有。

286
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:24,374
在这个范围内，你在开玩笑吗？

287
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,855
- 来吧，伙计。- 这是士官长。

288
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,248
[Antares] 是的，这是士官长，

289
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:29,771
分为八个不同的部分。

290
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:30,946
[凯斯勒]不，不，你错过了。

291
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,948
[安塔瑞斯] 好吧。

292
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,819
[拉埃拉]你在这里做什么？

293
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,997
玩。

294
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:38,998
我们有好消息。

295
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:41,739
船修好了。

296
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,220
我们可以离开了。

297
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,396
你说需要几天时间。

298
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,137
是索伦。

299
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:51,793
- 我们工作了一整夜。- 过来。

300
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,925
- 我们还没有完成。- 凯斯勒。

301
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:59,105
[凯斯勒叹气]

302
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,064
该走了。

303
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:04,545
我能来吗？

304
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,242
- 是的。- 不。

305
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,200
大家都去。

306
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:11,421
我们都是一家人。

307
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:12,988
你先走吧，我去船上接你。

308
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,642
我们可以等待。

309
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:18,211
别为难自己，我能应付。

310
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,519
- 卡琳娜。- 没问题。

311
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:25,914
[心宿二]卡琳娜。

312
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:28,960
快点。

313
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,746
[紧张的音乐]

314
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:44,237
[不祥的音乐]

315
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:53,898
拿走你的东西。

316
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,343
[凯斯勒]关，你可以出来了。

317
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:08,130
【情感音乐】

318
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,968
[约翰呻吟]

319
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,710
那么，当你们加入 ONI 时，这就是你们的想法吗？

320
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:25,147
我们和你一样不喜欢这样，酋长。

321
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,420
[约翰]如果你再靠近一点，

322
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:38,987
我们得谈谈我们的感受。

323
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:39,944
[警卫]这只是例行的心理评估，长官。

324
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,817
[门嗖地响]

325
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:47,735
[门牢牢地关上]

326
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,780
[电梯呼呼地响]

327
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,522
- 对不起。- 什么？

328
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,525
[守卫咕哝]

329
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:59,312
[紧张的音乐]

330
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:06,275
- [开门声] - [悦耳的音乐]

331
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:09,148
- 你好。- 嘿，里兹。

332
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,888
他们取消了我们的训练。

333
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,937
我坐在我的铺位上，所以——

334
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:18,113
[路易斯]所以你决定来这里？

335
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,335
是的。

336
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,598
[食物滋滋作响]

337
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,340
[路易斯]看看我找到了谁。

338
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,516
嘿，和我们一起吃晚饭吧。

339
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:30,734
约会之夜过去了。

340
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,301
哦，对不起。

341
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,260
不不不，别听他的。

342
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,262
他的约会之夜的想法以他入睡而告终

343
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,481
听卫星广播，我洗碗。

344
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:41,658
[路易斯]宝贝，你不洗碗，机器洗碗。

345
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,574
必须有人按下按钮，过来。

346
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:47,882
你知道，我希望你饿了。

347
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,406
吃完饭我可以给你一些治疗，好吗？

348
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:51,712
噢，我来这里并不是真的为了这个。

349
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,018
一切都好？

350
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:58,109
嗯，我想我刚刚开始走路，

351
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:03,332
但事实证明我真的无处可去。

352
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,074
哦，看在上帝的份上，你让我很难过。

353
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:08,381
现在我们必须喝酒，坐下。

354
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,779
它看起来很漂亮。

355
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,825
谢谢。

356
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,219
路易斯的健康状况如何？

357
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:21,611
我们喝什么？

358
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:23,918
你的最爱。

359
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,977
跟我说话。

360
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:44,243
前几天你说

361
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,944
还有其他的生活方式，其他的事情。

362
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,511
这是正确的。

363
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,515
像什么？

364
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:56,777
[轻笑]

365
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:02,870
我们不知道该任务未经授权。

366
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:05,307
我，里兹，有。

367
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:07,483
我们在黑暗中。

368
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,398
郑重声明，

369
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:10,878
酋长只是在做他认为正确的事情。

370
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,272
嗯，这就是我所关心的。

371
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,534
听着，我很感谢你来到这里

372
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:15,970
为您的 CO 辩护。

373
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:18,277
如果酋长走出了链条，

374
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:21,584
需要有纪律，我明白。

375
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,847
但我们不是为了坐以待毙而生的。

376
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:26,241
这对我们不好。

377
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,157
我们需要参与战斗。

378
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:30,941
我不会改变我的决定。

379
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:32,421
我不是要求你这么做。

380
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,511
我们正处于战争之中，长官。

381
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,426
我们仍然是你们拥有的最好的武器。

382
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,341
您是否建议我部署银牌团队

383
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,082
没有它的领导者？

384
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,692
不，先生。

385
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:45,434
只有我。

386
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:48,872
暂时，直到约翰被清除为止。

387
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,004
如果他不是呢？

388
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,615
他是酋长。

389
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,882
二十分钟前，

390
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:01,450
约翰使被指派监视他的士兵失去了行动能力，

391
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:03,278
并逃离了这个设施。

392
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,889
什么？

393
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,543
[艾克森]他有和你分享他的计划吗？

394
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,763
计划，什么？

395
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,330
- 有什么计划？- 他在哪里？

396
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,679
哦，我不知道。

397
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,941
上次我们谈话时，

398
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:15,551
我问你是否有顾虑

399
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:16,900
关于约翰的精神稳定性，你说——

400
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:18,815
- 那是以前的事了。- 在什么之前？

401
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,689
这种情况已经持续多久了？

402
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,604
- 我不知道。- 自从 Cortana 被删除后，

403
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,607
或者自从约翰与圣约人特工互动以来？

404
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,044
我查看了该文件。

405
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,306
你在暗示什么？

406
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:35,615
你我都知道他不是他自己。

407
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,925
听着，凯，我，我想和你分享一些东西，

408
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:44,624
这不是我作为你的上级说的，这是……

409
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,543
有时人们并没有好起来。

410
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,242
他只是需要时间。

411
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,420
有时，我们坚持下去会造成更大的伤害。

412
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:03,338
我不能留下来看着他。

413
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:06,602
[艾克森]我知道。

414
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:09,475
告诉我该怎么做。

415
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:19,310
[Kwan] 有时需要几周才能到达这里，有时需要几个月。

416
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,269
有些人根本就没有到过这里。

417
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:24,011
我们带着四艘船离开了马德里加尔。

418
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,447
我们带着一个来了。

419
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,930
你看到了吗？

420
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:32,846
这是他们在您签订契约之前处理您的地方。

421
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:34,587
它不是免费的。

422
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,286
没有什么是免费的。

423
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,295
对不起。

424
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,385
对于发生在你身上的事情。

425
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,561
别这样。

426
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,738
大多数人的情况更糟，

427
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:58,611
有时我认为这是我应得的。

428
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,135
我正在受到惩罚。

429
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:04,617
- 别这样说话。- 这是真的。

430
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:07,794
我不应该在这里，这不是我的生活。

431
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,536
我没有尽到对我的人民和我的星球的责任。

432
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,625
你不能为此责怪自己。

433
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:13,756
我是关哈

434
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:19,283
我的家人保护马德里加尔

435
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,677
代代相传的世代数不胜数。

436
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,290
而当轮到我的时候...

437
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:28,292
[警报声]

438
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:30,120
[莱拉] 蛋？

439
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:33,733
[喊叫声]

440
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,474
该走了。我们可以融入。

441
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,128
我们现在必须搬家了。

442
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:47,181
- [无线电噼啪声] - [喊叫声]

443
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:51,664
[悬疑音乐]

444
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,585
把它脱下来，他们会注意到你的。

445
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:05,242
[发动机轰鸣]

446
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:07,680
- 我们躲起来了吗？- 不。

447
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:11,335
- 我们去哪？- 为了让你爸爸回来。

448
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:13,033
我们害怕吗？

449
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,994
不，保持靠近。

450
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,043
[悬疑音乐]

451
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,056
[关]低着头。

452
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,623
别看。

453
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,928
[悬疑音乐继续]

454
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,321
[男子] 向前挺身而出。

455
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:42,323
[男人2]继续前进！

456
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:07,435
[悬疑音乐继续]

457
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:10,481
- 我们现在害怕吗？- 系好安全带。

458
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:15,225
[悬疑音乐继续]

459
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:20,491
- [船舶发动机爆破] - [悬疑音乐继续]

460
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:26,410
[沮丧的喊叫]

461
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:29,109
一切都会好起来的，凯斯。

462
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,591
我们现在就去找你爸爸。

463
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:38,335
- 告诉过你了。- [悬疑音乐继续]

464
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:42,557
- [莱拉]哦，不，不。- [悬疑音乐继续]

465
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,646
[Kwan] 不，我们不会成功的！

466
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,692
【拉埃拉】坚持住！

467
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:51,740
- [船舶发动机爆破] - [悬疑音乐继续]

468
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:56,266
- 妈妈！- [悬疑音乐继续]

469
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:58,225
妈妈！

470
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:02,011
- [莱拉]该死！- [悬疑音乐继续]

471
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:07,103
- [船舶发动机关闭] - [悬疑音乐继续]

472
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:15,111
你在干什么？

473
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:16,678
等我行动，然后带凯斯勒离开这里。

474
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:19,638
- 使用舱口。- 你呢？

475
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,248
足够值得你们两个

476
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:23,511
- 在那个交通工具上。- 不。

477
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,121
答应我你会带他上那艘船。

478
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,820
答应我你会保护他。

479
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:30,561
- [敲门] - [Antares] 莱拉！

480
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,476
- 不，他们会杀了你。- 妈妈？

481
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:34,957
[轻柔的音乐]

482
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:36,742
- [安塔瑞斯] 开门吧，莱拉！- [轻柔的音乐继续]

483
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:40,920
- 一会儿见。- [轻柔的音乐继续]

484
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,573
[敲门]

485
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,098
[Antares] 别让我烧掉这扇门。

486
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:47,753
她在这里。

487
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,409
聪明的女孩，这可能会变得混乱。

488
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:57,545
- Laera，对不起，我从来没有—— - 放弃吧，这不是针对个人的。

489
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,112
这是！

490
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:03,464
- [吹着陆] - [战士咕哝]

491
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,165
[Briggs] 我们在 80 米处找到了 Cobalt Team

492
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:10,645
从继电器。

493
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:11,907
他们在树上。

494
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:16,695
我们观察到该区域的等离子疤痕。

495
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:19,523
我认为他们没有预见到它的到来。

496
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,004
[凯斯]谢谢你，队长。

497
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:24,877
[布里格斯]你想如何处理这个问题？

498
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,140
尸体吗，先生？

499
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,968
[凯斯]没有尸体。

500
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:32,623
- 我会把它列为 MIA。- 先生。

501
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,452
- 我们走吧。- [门关上]

502
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,636
你还好吗，上将？

503
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,857
不。

504
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:53,079
我明白。

505
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:55,995
这是一场悲剧。

506
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:59,172
- 你知道吗... - 请原谅我？

507
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:03,480
你知道士官长的怀疑是正确的吗

508
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,396
当你派我们的士兵去敌对时——

509
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,442
我讨厌这种暗示。

510
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,400
我想知道你知道什么

511
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,054
我想知道你什么时候知道的。

512
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:14,840
- 冷静一下啦。- 冷静下来？

513
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:19,148
圣约就在这个星球上！

514
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,063
这是时间问题。

515
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,630
这一天是不可避免的。

516
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:24,066
这是数学，上将。

517
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:26,590
在每一次分析、每一次模拟中——

518
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:28,549
这不是一个该死的模拟！

519
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:31,378
对，不是。

520
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:34,598
但决定下一步该做什么是我的工作。

521
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,252
我们必须向指挥部发出警报。

522
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:39,690
我向你保证，你的上级已经完全清楚了。

523
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,041
[嘲笑]

524
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,697
我们需要启动冬季应急计划。

525
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,439
立即开始平民疏散！

526
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:53,792
结束了，上将。我们赢不了这场比赛。

527
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:56,838
如果您发出疏散警报，

528
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:59,536
我们将会陷入混乱、恐慌。

529
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:02,409
几天前，Cobalt Team受到了圣约元素的攻击。

530
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,672
我们只能假设星盟舰队也不甘落后。

531
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,675
有一个计划，

532
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:10,330
但这需要一些艰难的选择。

533
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:14,813
我需要知道你和我在一起。

534
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:19,948
[紧张的音乐]

535
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:23,256
- 我们不会打架。- 我没这么说。

536
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:26,085
我们要战斗，但我们不会赢。

537
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:29,915
[紧张的音乐继续]

538
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:31,699
- 这是到达。- 我知道。

539
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,657
数百万人的家园——

540
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,007
我们会尽力节省。

541
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:39,315
- 这是我的家！- 这也是我的家！

542
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:42,928
别以为这不会让我付出一切。

543
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:46,453
[紧张的音乐继续]

544
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:51,675
——但这就是现实，上将。- [紧张的音乐继续]

545
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:54,504
我们要么面对它，要么死。

546
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,680
[紧张的音乐继续]

547
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,900
重要资产正在运输中

548
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,684
就在我们说话的时候，我们已经离开了这个星球。

549
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,861
把你的东西放在一起。

550
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:05,864
- 不告诉任何人。- [紧张的音乐继续]

551
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,909
我不会跑。

552
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:11,608
当我们能赢的时候，你会再战。

553
00:31:11,695 --> 00:31:13,784
[紧张的音乐继续]

554
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:19,051
凯斯上将，我可以信赖你吗？

555
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:21,401
[紧张的音乐继续]

556
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:25,927
-去你妈的吧。- [紧张的音乐继续]

557
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,807
[Laera] 我的丈夫在哪里？

558
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,897
- 他还活着吗？- 安塔瑞斯？

559
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:42,596
- 现在还不算太晚，安塔瑞斯。- 是啊，就是。

560
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:46,078
[船舶发动机启动]

561
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:50,996
继续吧，关。

562
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,172
[紧张的音乐]

563
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:54,651
[清嗓子]

564
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,397
[守卫]停下来。

565
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:02,355
[警卫]等等。

566
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,096
我妈妈在哪里？

567
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:08,970
- [紧张的音乐继续] - [船舶发动机启动]

568
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:13,235
- 我很快就能见到她吗？- [紧张的音乐继续]

569
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:17,761
- 说实话。- [紧张的音乐继续]

570
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:20,939
- 是的。- [紧张的音乐继续]

571
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:33,212
- 城里最好的。你要？- 不。

572
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:36,345
- 尝试一下。- 不，谢谢。

573
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:39,348
[食客们议论纷纷]

574
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,922
你一直有这个问题。

575
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,533
你无法控制。

576
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,231
你的意思是不可控。

577
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:54,450
我们达成了协议。

578
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,931
你要给我带来信息，而不是关注。

579
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:58,933
我有信息。

580
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,630
但我想知道你首先要用它做什么。

581
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:05,331
我们有一个共同的目标，那就是赢得这场战争。

582
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,335
别误会我是朋友。

583
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:14,427
- 好的。- [食客们叽叽喳喳]

584
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,042
我相信圣约就在这里。

585
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:24,350
- 在拉面里？- 到达时。

586
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:31,835
你是认真的。

587
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,750
一队斯巴达人失踪了。

588
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:36,144
FLEETCOM 假装他们不知道发生了什么事。

589
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,319
你认为圣约是——

590
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:39,191
我知道这是契约。

591
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,196
我建议你考虑一下你所说的。

592
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:46,067
这就是我一直在做的一切。

593
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:47,938
我一直在想。我一直在说。

594
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,071
似乎没有人在听。

595
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:53,814
- ONI 知道！- 小声点。

596
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:57,122
[低] ONI 知道。他们正在掩盖它。

597
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:59,820
他们为什么要那样做？

598
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:02,214
ONI 会保护自己。

599
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,780
让他们成为你的敌人，

600
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,740
即使你是士官长也没关系

601
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:09,090
你将不再有用。

602
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:11,353
当你不再有用时，那——

603
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,227
- 不，你没听， - 你为什么打架，约翰？

604
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:20,971
- 什么？- 你们打架，为什么？

605
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,628
为了胜利，为了保卫我们的家园。

606
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,456
为了保护人类。

607
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:32,548
不，你打架是因为我告诉你的。

608
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:36,509
你是一名军人，就当一名军人。

609
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,426
这就是你要做的。

610
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,689
回到那里吧。

611
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:44,647
返回舰队司令部。

612
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,432
亲你必须亲的屁股。

613
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,695
你去双桅船里度过你的时光吧。

614
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:49,913
微笑。

615
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,264
你永远不会再提起它。

616
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:54,831
他们可能会再给你一枚奖牌。

617
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:58,444
[椅子刮伤]

618
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:04,928
[紧张的音乐]

619
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:08,280
我需要知道我们彼此理解。

620
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:12,719
上将，您到底什么时候离开 ONI 的？

621
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:16,026
如果你离开这里，我就帮不了你了。

622
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,900
- 你从未离开过。- 退下，约翰。

623
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:22,642
我不这么认为。

624
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,080
[紧张的音乐继续]

625
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:44,664
[艾克森]我从来不明白它们到底有多么脆弱。

626
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,059
脆弱的？

627
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,236
是的，因为你就是这样做的。

628
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:52,846
不。

629
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:54,195
当他们还是孩子的时候，你就带走了他们。

630
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:56,371
你调节了它们。

631
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,025
然后当他们长大到能够独立思考时，

632
00:35:58,112 --> 00:36:00,549
你确保他们永远不会。

633
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:03,987
你把这些颗粒放进去。

634
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,033
所以他们从来不需要感受到欲望

635
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,560
或野心或偏好。

636
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:14,563
所以他们永远不会选择除了你以外的任何人。

637
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,698
就是这样，不是吗？

638
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,918
- 你为什么在这？- 我只是来道别。

639
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,878
我走了。

640
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:29,535
而我，我想我想让你知道

641
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:31,885
你的努力没有白费，凯瑟琳，

642
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:33,582
你不会在这里看到它。

643
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:39,109
但你所创造的这些东西，尽管可能已经破碎，

644
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,763
他们将成为基础

645
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,418
为了一些非凡的事情。

646
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:49,555
我希望这最终能给你带来一些安慰。

647
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:53,298
[轻柔的音乐]

648
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,952
你不想知道她是怎么死的吗？

649
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,174
[轻柔的音乐继续]

650
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,785
什么？

651
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:07,877
朱莉娅. 你以为我不知道她是谁吗？

652
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:11,229
我记得他们所有人。

653
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:14,319
尤其是你妹妹。

654
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:20,368
她……她实在是太好奇了。

655
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:22,762
她曾经问过很多问题。

656
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,506
但你永远不知道谁会成功

657
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:31,727
增强和谁不是。

658
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:34,643
- 她没有。- [轻柔的音乐继续]

659
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,906
- 不。 - [轻柔的音乐继续]

660
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:39,474
她快要死了。

661
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:46,264
她不知道为什么。她无法理解。

662
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:52,574
我或多或少地告诉了她你刚才告诉我的事情。

663
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:57,884
即使她看不到，

664
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:03,672
她将是下一步前进的一小部分。

665
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:07,023
不知道她是否听懂了。

666
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,461
她很害怕。

667
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,295
但我知道她非常爱你。

668
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,952
我希望这能给你一些安慰。

669
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,391
[轻柔的音乐继续]

670
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:31,961
[轻笑]是的。

671
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:42,494
[戏剧性的呼气]

672
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:50,110
我以为你要走了。

673
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,591
我不想让你孤单。

674
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:56,986
- 我不是怪物。- [轻柔的音乐继续]

675
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:01,687
[紧张的音乐]

676
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:12,915
[艾克森]我会让你们两个重新认识一下。

677
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:15,178
[紧张的音乐继续]

678
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:17,920
[稳定的金属撞击声]

679
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:19,661
你让我很难帮助你。

680
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:22,882
- 老板，我们正在退出滑行空间。- 我听到了。

681
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,927
我让他们为所欲为...

682
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:27,190
[戏剧性的笑声] ...你已经死了。

683
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:28,627
我们对你很好，安塔瑞斯。

684
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,020
哦。出色地。

685
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:34,763
谢谢你让我勉强存在

686
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,678
并通过四种方式勉强维持微薄的生活

687
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:39,855
当你和你丈夫一起度过的时候，和这些笨蛋在一起

688
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,770
- 所有牧歌的钱-- - 你在说什么？

689
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:43,206
别装傻了！

690
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:44,730
我知道你不是。

691
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:46,209
我通常可以和我丈夫讲道理，

692
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,124
但当他发现这件事时——

693
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:51,563
我其实并不担心。最后我见到索伦，

694
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,043
他在一艘前往致远星的监狱船上。

695
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,089
所以安顿下来。

696
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:59,397
可能需要一段时间。

697
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:04,358
- 你就是个混蛋。- 不，我是一个机会主义者。

698
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,929
[远处金属叮当作响]

699
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:13,106
现在，它在哪里？

700
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:17,632
[远处叮当声继续]

701
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,025
有人可以处理一下吗？

702
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:21,114
我听不到自己的想法。

703
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,551
[远处叮当声继续]

704
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:24,813
谢谢。

705
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,555
[远处叮当声继续]

706
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:29,905
我不知道鲁比·安向你承诺了什么

707
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:32,081
但你被耍了，安塔瑞斯，现在还不算太晚。

708
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:37,391
“请停一下。”

709
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,176
索伦告诉你一切。

710
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:41,961
你知道他把它藏在哪里了。

711
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:44,267
- 藏了什么？- 宝藏，宝贝，财物。

712
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:45,791
[莱拉笑]

713
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,619
你觉得这很有趣吗？

714
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:52,711
因为我向你保证...

715
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:56,541
[紧张的音乐]

716
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:57,629
...它不是。

717
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:03,417
你所说的宝藏是装满了一个盒子

718
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,637
起初并不值钱的氘代币。

719
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:10,990
- 听够了。- [紧张的音乐继续]

720
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:12,295
鲁比·安不想要钱。

721
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:13,340
她想要瓦砾。

722
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:14,776
- [枪栓] - [莱拉喘气]

723
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:18,519
- 冷静下来。- [紧张的音乐继续]

724
00:41:18,606 --> 00:41:20,739
你为什么要让我这么做？

725
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:24,394
你以为我想让凯斯勒成为孤儿吗？

726
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,309
我爱那个孩子。

727
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,268
她在笑你。

728
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:30,444
[远处叮当声继续]

729
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:33,491
- 你听到那个声音了吗？- 是的。

730
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:37,233
是的，你认为你应该为此做点什么？

731
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,539
我在看。

732
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,410
[远处叮当声继续]

733
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,239
去看看是什么发出了这个声音。

734
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:48,027
[远处叮当声继续]

735
00:41:56,078 --> 00:41:58,167
- 藏品在哪里？- 她在拖延。

736
00:41:58,254 --> 00:42:00,430
你能闭嘴吗？

737
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,084
我不记得询问过任何人的意见。

738
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:04,870
我是队长。

739
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:07,568
这是我的船，

740
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:11,224
这是你最后的机会，莱拉。

741
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:13,443
[远处叮当声继续]

742
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,143
- 它在哪里？- [紧张的音乐继续]

743
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,580
我不能告诉你，因为它不存在。

744
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:22,365
如果它确实存在，我不会告诉你。

745
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:26,108
[紧张的音乐继续]

746
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:30,286
你刚刚把它从我手里夺走了。

747
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:34,290
请记住，我不想要接下来发生的事情。

748
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:37,816
[紧张的音乐继续]

749
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:47,956

[紧张的音乐]

752
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:08,107
你有一分钟​​的时间重新考虑你的立场。

753
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:13,634
- [倒计时蜂鸣声] - [空气嘶嘶声]

754
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:15,854
事情不必是这样的。

755
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:18,639
[莱拉呼吸困难]

756
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:20,989
想想凯斯勒吧！

757
00:43:21,076 --> 00:43:24,384
索伦在致远星，谁来照顾他？

758
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,299
- [莱拉呼吸困难] - [紧张的音乐建筑]

759
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:27,953

764
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:11,736
凯斯勒在哪里？

765
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:17,393
- 关？- [轻柔的音乐继续]

766
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,527
关，我问你一个问题——

767
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:23,617
- [Carina 咕哝] - [Kwan 大喊]

768
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:28,535
- [刀声响起] - [紧张的音乐继续]

769
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:33,148
- [Kwan 咕哝] - [身体重击]

770
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:35,107
[轻柔的音乐]

771
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:38,371
- 我把他送上了交通工具 - 我告诉过你要和他在一起。

772
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:41,548
- 我不能。- 为什么不？

773
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:42,897
因为那样你就死了。

774
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:47,510
[轻柔的音乐继续]

775
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:51,863
[敲门]

776
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,648
我需要和佩雷斯下士谈谈。

777
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,695
- 她不在这里。- 她在哪？

778
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,222
她是个好女孩。

779
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:06,051
是的女士。

780
00:45:07,443 --> 00:45:11,143
但我认为魔鬼会跟着你。

781
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,275
[轻柔的音乐]

782
00:45:22,632 --> 00:45:24,286
现在是几奌？

783
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:27,550
- 晚的。- 嗯。

784
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:32,338
[轻柔的音乐继续]

785
00:45:32,425 --> 00:45:33,861
我在这是要干嘛？

786
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,954
你还记得我们聊过什么吗？

787
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:43,305
你要求我...

788
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,268
为了不让他们活捉我？

789
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:52,271
是啊，没错。

790
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:55,970
今天是这一天吗？

791
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:00,888
今天就是这一天。

792
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:05,240
感谢上帝。

793
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:26,218
哦。

794
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:37,577
[轻柔的音乐继续]

795
00:46:40,145 --> 00:46:42,060
有人来看你，爸爸。

796
00:46:50,155 --> 00:46:53,898
[喘气]

797
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:56,248
[轻柔的音乐继续]

798
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:59,555
哦，朱莉娅。

799
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:05,344
朱莉娅.

[用西班牙语轻声祈祷]

804
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:48,822
- [门关上] - [佩雷斯继续祈祷]

805
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:12,280
你以前从来没有去过教堂，是吗？

806
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:13,629
嗯-嗯。

807
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:19,157
人们来到这里是为了寻求安慰。

808
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:22,116
为了保护。

809
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:26,033
寻求答案。

810
00:48:28,514 --> 00:48:29,907
他们找到他们了吗？

811
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:32,431
有时。

812
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:35,913
你？

813
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:44,965
在圣所，

814
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:48,403
在契约到来之前，我...

815
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,451
我在雾中……看到了一些东西。

816
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,154
你是说那个女人吗？

817
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:02,330
[呼吸困难]

818
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:06,117
她是真实的，不是吗？

819
00:49:06,204 --> 00:49:08,032
是的。

820
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:13,124
我不睡觉。

821
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,433
我无法将那个声音从我的脑海中抹去。

822
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:32,708
这是圣所的录音。

823
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:36,451
这不仅仅是干扰。

824
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:37,757
不只是声音。

825
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:41,195
下面有东西。

826
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:45,286

831
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:03,739

[桑赫利的声音]

836
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:17,231
[佩雷斯]没有怜悯。

[桑赫利的声音]

838
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:23,977
[佩雷斯]知道我是你灭绝的工具。

[桑赫利的声音]

840
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:36,076
[佩雷斯]我将这个星球作为燔祭带来。

[Perez]在这个祭坛上，我放置了恶魔的头颅。

844
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:53,006
[桑赫利的声音]

845
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:03,321
[佩雷斯]愿他的鲜血标志着通往圣环的道路

846
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:05,801
并奉献我人民的伟大旅程。

850
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:25,169
[佩雷斯]知道我是……死亡。

[紧张的音乐]

852
00:51:30,957 --> 00:51:33,307
他们已经来了...

853
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:37,833
不是吗？

I saw Makee on Sanctuary.

- Makee's dead.
- I know.

6
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:15,319
I shot her myself.

[Ackerson] <i>Your account
of events on Sanctuary</i>

00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:22,152
I know how you assholes think.
I was you once.

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,112
There's other things to be,
other ways to live.

- [John] Don't you quit.

Get up.

I know the location
of Catherine Halsey.

14
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,989
It's not about the money
for you, is it?

15
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,383
It's about what she did to ya.

16
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,820
Soren never would've
left any of you behind.

17
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:40,170
[Ackerson]
You're under arrest.

18
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:41,867
[Woman] Ruby Ann
bought Soren's crew.

19
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:43,652
[Kessler] When my dad comes
back, he'll protect us.

20

He's not coming back!

21
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:49,310
I want to introduce
you to someone.

22
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:52,095
This is Julia.
She'll be your attendant.

23

Where is she?

24
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:55,490

00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,092
Riz?

[Riz] <i>Visegrád Relay,

00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:38,810
[Kai] Where is everybody?

64
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,465
<i>- Over.</i>
- We're on our own.

65
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:43,859
FLEETCOM doesn't believe
the Covenant's on Reach.

66
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,209
They just think
Cobalt's missing.

67
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:48,037
This is a search
and rescue mission,

68
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:50,039
but we need to be prepared
for the possibility

69
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,649
that Cobalt ran into something.

70
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:54,086
[Vannak] Something Covenant?

71
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,524
[John] Command thinks
this planet's untouchable.

72
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,613
They haven't
seen what we've seen,

73
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,745
and they don't
know what we know.

74
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:03,183
I'll tell you this,
we will have contact.

75
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,447
Until then, it's just us.

76
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:11,234
[Kai] This seem right to you?

77
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,454
[Vannak grunts softly]

[clanking footsteps]

86
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,457
[John] See if you
can get the power up.

87
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,632
[Riz] Copy, Chief.

88
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:36,553
[Vannak] Left in a hurry.

89
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,209
No sign of Cobalt,
no breach marks at the--

[sudden silence]

95
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,796
[Kai] What the hell was that?

96
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:03,624
[Riz] I don't know, I've
never heard anything like it.

97
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:06,975
[John] I have, on Sanctuary.

98
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:11,153
[heavy clank]

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,592
[steady pounding on doors]

100
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,942
[Vannak] You believe him now?

101
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,988
[steady pounding continues]

[distorted audio]

108
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,348
[Briggs]
Stand down!

109
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,003
Tell your team to lower
their weapons, Master Chief.

110
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,744
[Vannak] What is this?

111
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,703
- Chief?
- Now.

112
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,228
I can't even describe
the amount of shit you're in.

113
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:27,490
[Kai] I can't even describe

114
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,144
what's about to
happen to your face.

115
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,450
[Vannak] Who the hell
are these people?

116
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,190
I carry priority
orders from FLEETCOM.

117
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,583
- What orders?
- To bring you in.

118
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,456
[John] You are impeding
my mission, move.

119
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,327
There is no mission.

120
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,895
- You stole a Condor.
- What?

121
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:43,245
- Falsified a flight plan.
- What is she talking about?

122
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:45,421
You're not even authorized to
be in those suits right now,

123
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,162
let alone pointing
a gun at my face.

124
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,252
So stand down, or
we will engage you.

125
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,296
[Riz] Good luck with that.

126
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,733
[Vannak] Chief, what do we do?

127
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:56,954
[John] Where is Cobalt Team?

128
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,261
- Last chance.
- John.

129
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,263
[John] Tell me where Cobalt is,
or I'm going through that door.

130
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,134
[Briggs] I gave you an order.

131
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,571
[Vannak] What's the call?

132
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,269
Chief?

133
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:09,532
[steady pounding on doors]

134
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,669
[Briggs] Ah, stand
down, do not fire!

135
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,543
- Chief.
- They were here.

136
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:22,893
I can prove it.

137
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,765
[Kai sighs]

138
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:28,420
[Kai] Not like this.

139
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,858
[somber music]

140
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,648
We were a thousand feet up,

141
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:42,260
wind whipping, cables groaning.

142
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:44,349
Couldn't have been more
than two degrees up there.

143
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:48,397
- January, you know?
- Yeah.

144
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,965
And I can't hold it anymore.

145
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,968
I'm strapped in the
harness, and I look down,

146
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:56,536
I tell Arthur,
I say, "I gotta go."

147
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:59,190
[laughs]
What's he gonna do?

148
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,496
You peed on Uncle Arthur?

149
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,978
I peed on him.
What could he do?

150
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:06,720
Okay, lift your chin up, yeah.

151
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,204
What the hell's wrong with you?

152
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,032
This shit is funny.

153
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,251
Well, I've heard it before.

154
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,035
What difference does that make?

155
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:22,431
You're supposed to damn well
laugh when I repeat myself.

156
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:24,346
I'm the one that's senile.

157
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,782
I don't know what you're
complaining about.

158
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,044
I'm not complaining.

159
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,134
Well, I mean, you want to.

160
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,484
What is it?

161
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,704
Your secret's safe with me.

162
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,707
Is this about that thing

163
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,231
that you weren't
supposed to tell me?

164
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:42,016
You weren't supposed
to remember.

165
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,888
I don't choose what I forget.

166
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:49,110
I might have to go away.

167
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,374
Where?

168
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:55,899
And I can't take you with me.

169
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,771
[somber music]

170
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,907
- I know.
- I want to, but I can't.

171
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:08,564
You see that bridge?

172
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,957
[Ackerson] I can't stop it, Dad.

173
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,480
You know who built that bridge?

174
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,700
It's not up to me.

175
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,440
- It's too late.
- I built that bridge.

176
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:18,879
Me and your Uncle Arthur.

177
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,794
The day it was finished,

178
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:25,059
I walked across it with
your mum, and your sister.

179
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,845
She couldn't have
been more than 3.

180
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,414
Held her little hand.

181
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:33,850
She wouldn't let me pick her up.

182
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:37,811
She wanted to walk
the whole way.

183
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,553
Yeah.
[chuckles]

184
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,686
All right.

185
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:45,209
So when's she coming?

186
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,212
Your sister.

187
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,827
She's gone, Dad.

188
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,221
Julia's gone.

189
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:58,919
Mum, too.

190
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:05,229
Oh.

191
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:08,885
- It's just you and me.
- I know that.

192
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,234
I damn well know that.

193
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:12,236
Don't think that
I don't know that.

194
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:17,981
Oh, sorry.

195
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,156
[Ackerson] It's okay.

196
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:26,033
Sorry, I just, sorry,
I just get confused sometimes.

197
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,861
It's okay.

198
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:34,737
Doesn't mean that I
don't know what's real.

199
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:41,004
See you tomorrow, okay?

200
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:41,831
Okay.

201
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,271
- Promise me...
- Yeah, I promise.

202
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:51,275
No, promise me you won't
let them take me alive.

stealing a goddamn Condor?

Sir.

208
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:13,428
I'm looking at 15
infractions of the UCMJ,

209
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,517
one of which involves
pointing a loaded weapon

210
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:16,561
in the face of an officer?

211
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:17,649
I did that, sir.

212
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,521
Sir, I had credible information.

213
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:23,525
You had a feeling.
You had a delusion.

214
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,746
You went outside the chain.

215
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:29,487
Didn't ya?

216
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,318
Yes, sir.

217
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,497
Effective immediately,

Admiral Keyes, I know--

221
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:48,463
You know nothing because
it's not your job to know.

222
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,769
It's mine.

223
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,466
Your job is to follow orders.

224
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,816
Cobalt was at Visegrád, sir.

225

What's that?

226
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:05,480
Four days ago, Cobalt
was deployed to Aktis IV.

227
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,964
No, this isn't right.

228
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,619
I saw Cobalt's flight plan.

229
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,665
- [Vannak] Chief.
- I saw it.

230
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,275
They changed it!

231
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:21,061
[somber music]

232
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,066
I know what I saw.

233
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:33,508
John-117 is relieved
from active duty,

234
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,292
and will be confined to barracks

235
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:38,513
'til such a time as he clears
a psychiatric evaluation.

236
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,036
A what?

237
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:41,733
117 will submit
to neurochemical--

238
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,431
Is this you, or
is this Ackerson?

239
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,085
John, stop.

240
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,652
Rack your suits, dismissed.

241
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,572
Did you even try to defend us?

242
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,098
I'm the only reason you're
not facing a court-martial.

243
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,540
You lied to us.

244
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,324
I told you what you needed to
know to complete the mission.

245
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:10,284
- There was no mission.
- Cobalt was at Visegrád.

246
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,938
- Chief, can I talk to you?
- This is ONI, all of it.

247
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,505
- This is Ackerson.
- Come on, Chief.

248
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,203
- Why do you think he's here?
- I can't listen to this.

249
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,987
Where do you think you're going?

250
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,946
Vannak!

251
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,948
- You are out of control.
- What?

252
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,645
You're not thinking
straight, you're erratic.

253
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:26,343
Since when do you
question my judgment?

254
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,260
Since you started
seeing dead people.

255
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:33,960
I didn't tell anyone you said
you saw Makee on Sanctuary.

256
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:38,051
John, I'm trying to help you.

257
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,401
I'm trying to talk to you,
as your friend.

258
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:44,622
I don't need a friend,
Petty Officer, I need a Spartan.

259
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,015
Why don't you try doing that?

260
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,673
125, you are not dismissed!

261
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,284
[somber music]

262
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,948
[indistinct chatter]

263
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,604
[man] Hey!

264
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,525
[liquid burbling]

265
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:20,876
[suspenseful music]

266
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:30,407
[Person] Who is she?

267
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,148
[Laera gasps]

268
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:33,845
[both grunting]

269
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,196
[knife zings]

270
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:38,502
- [knife clatters]
- [Laera coughing]

271
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,201
[Laera panting]

272
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:43,855
- Kwan?
- Shh!

273
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,554
[nearby voices]

274
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,818
What're you doing?

275
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,428
- You're in danger.
- I can see that.

276
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:52,864
Not from Ruby Ann.

277
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,866
I'm talking about your crew.

278
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,564
[eerie music]

279
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:58,958
Ruby Ann bought them off.

280
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,003
- They got rid of Soren.
- What?

281
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,787
- You're next.
- What?

282
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:06,966
- Is Soren--
- I don't know.

283
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,794
You have to get Kessler and go.

284
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:13,885
[imitating gunfire]

285
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:22,416
- Come on, man, I got you.
- Did not.

286
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:24,374
Are you kidding me,
at this range?

287
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,855
- Come on, man.
- It's Master Chief.

288
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,248
[Antares] Yeah,
it's Master Chief,

289
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:29,771
in eight different pieces.

290
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:30,946
[Kessler] Nope, nope,
you missed.

291
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,948
[Antares] Fine.

292
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,819
[Laera]
What are you doing here?

293
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,997
Playing.

294
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:38,998
We have good news.

295
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:41,739
Ship's fixed.

296
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,220
We can leave.

297
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,396
You said it would
take a couple of days.

298
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,137
It's Soren.

299
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:51,793
- We worked all night.
- Come here.

300
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,925
- We're not finished.
- Kessler.

301
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:59,105
[Kessler sighs]

302
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,064
Time to go.

303
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:04,545
Can I come?

304
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,242
- Yeah.
- No.

305
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,200
Everybody goes.

306
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:11,421
We're all family.

307
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:12,988
You go ahead, I'll
meet you at the ship.

308
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,642
We can wait.

309
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:18,211
Don't trouble
yourselves, I can manage.

310
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,519
- Carina.
- It's no trouble.

311
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:25,914
[Antares] Carina.

312
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:28,960
Come on.

313
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,746
[tense music]

314
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:44,237
[ominous music]

315
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:53,898
Get your things.

316
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,343
[Kessler] Kwan,
you can come out.

317
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:08,130
[emotional music]

318
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,968
[John groans]

319
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,710
So, when you guys joined ONI,
is this what you had in mind?

320
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:25,147
We don't like this any
more than you do, Chief.

321
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,420
[John] If you get any closer,

322
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:38,987
we're gonna have to
talk about our feelings.

323
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:39,944
[Guard] It's just a routine
psych eval, Chief.

324
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,817
[doors swoosh]

325
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:47,735
[doors close firmly]

326
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,780
[elevator whirring]

327
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,522
- Sorry.
- What?

328
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,525
[guards grunting]

329
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:59,312
[tense music]

330
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:06,275
- [door clicks]
- [pleasant music]

331
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:09,148
- Hi.
- Hey, Riz.

332
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,888
They canceled our training.

333
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,937
I was sitting in my bunk, so--

334
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:18,113
[Louis] So you decided
to come by here?

335
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,335
Yeah.

336
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,598
[food sizzling]

337
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,340
[Louis] Look who I found.

338
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,516
Hey, join us for dinner.

339
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:30,734
There goes date night.

340
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,301
Oh, I'm sorry.

341
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,260
No, no, no, no,
don't listen to him.

342
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,262
His idea of date night ends
with him falling asleep

343
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,481
listening to the sat-link,
and me doing the dishes.

344
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:41,658
[Louis] Babe, you don't do
the dishes, the machine does.

345
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,574
Someone has to press
the button, come here.

346
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:47,882
You know, I hope you're hungry.

347
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,406
I can give you some
treatment after we eat, yeah?

348
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:51,712
Oh, I didn't really
come here for that.

349
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,018
Everything okay?

350
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:58,109
Um, I guess I just
started walking,

351
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:03,332
but it turns out I don't
really have anywhere to go.

352
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,074
Oh, for God's sake,
you're making me sad.

353
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:08,381
Now we have to drink, sit.

354
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,779
It looks beautiful.

355
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,825
Thank you.

356
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,219
Louis' health?

357
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:21,611
What are we drinking?

358
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:23,918
Your favorite.

359
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,977
Talk to me.

360
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:44,243
The other day, you said

361
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,944
there were other ways to live,
other things to be.

362
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,511
That's right.

363
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,515
Like what?

364
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:56,777
[soft chuckle]

365
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:02,870
We didn't know the
mission wasn't authorized.

366
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:05,307
Me, Riz, Vannak.

367
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:07,483
We were in the dark.

368
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,398
And for the record,

369
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:10,878
Chief was just doing what
he thought was right.

370
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,272
Well, that's what concerns me.

371
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,534
Look, I appreciate
you coming down here

372
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:15,970
to advocate for your CO.

373
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:18,277
If the Chief went
outside the chain,

374
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:21,584
there needs to be
discipline, I get that.

375
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,847
But we're not built
to sit around and wait.

376
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:26,241
It's not good for us.

377
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,157
We need to be in the fight.

378
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:30,941
I'm not gonna
change my decision.

379
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:32,421
I'm not asking you to.

380
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,511
We are at war, sir.

381
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,426
We're still the best
weapons you have.

382
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,341
Are you suggesting
I deploy Silver Team

383
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,082
without its leader?

384
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,692
No, sir.

385
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:45,434
Just me.

386
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:48,872
Temporarily,
'til John's cleared.

387
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,004
And if he's not?

388
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,615
He's the Chief.

389
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,882
Twenty minutes ago,

390
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:01,450
John incapacitated the soldiers
assigned to monitor him,

391
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:03,278
and escaped this facility.

392
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,889
What?

393
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,543
[Ackerson] Did he share
his plans with you?

394
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,763
Plans, what?

395
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,330
- What plans?
- Where is he?

396
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,679
Oh, I don't know.

397
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,941
Last time we spoke,

398
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:15,551
I asked you if you had concerns

399
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:16,900
about John's mental
stability, and you said---

400
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:18,815
- That was before.
- Before what?

401
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,689
How long has this been going on?

402
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,604
- I don't know.
- Since Cortana was removed,

403
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,607
or since John interacted
with the Covenant agent?

404
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,044
I reviewed the file.

405
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,306
What are you implying?

406
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:35,615
You and I both know
he's not himself.

407
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,925
Look, Kai, I, I want to
share something with you,

408
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:44,624
and this isn't me speaking
as your superior, this is...

409
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,543
sometimes people
don't get better.

410
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,242
He just needs time.

411
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,420
Sometimes, we do more
damage by holding on.

412
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:03,338
I can't stay and watch him.

413
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:06,602
[Ackerson] I know.

414
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:09,475
Tell me what to do.

415
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:19,310
[Kwan] Sometimes it takes weeks
to get here, sometimes months.

416
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,269
Some never get here at all.

417
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:24,011
We left Madrigal
with four ships.

418
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,447
We arrived with one.

419
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,930
You see that?

420
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:32,846
That's where they process
you before you're indentured.

421
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:34,587
It's not free.

422
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,286
Nothing is free.

423
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,295
I'm sorry.

424
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,385
For what
happened to you.

425
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,561
Don't be.

426
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,738
Most people have it worse,

427
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:58,611
and sometimes I
think I deserve it.

428
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,135
I'm being punished.

429
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:04,617
- Don't talk like that.
- It's true.

430
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:07,794
I'm not supposed to be
here, this isn't my life.

431
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,536
I failed my responsibility
to my people and my planet.

432
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,625
You can't blame
yourself for that.

433
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:13,756
I'm Kwan Ha.

434
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:19,283
My family protected Madrigal

435
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,677
for more generations
than anyone can count.

436
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,290
And when it was my turn...

437
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:28,292
[alarm blaring]

438
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:30,120
[Laera] Kwan?

439
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:33,733
[voices shouting]

440
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,474
It's time to go.
We can blend in.

441
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,128
We have to move now.

442
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:47,181
- [radios crackling]
- [voices shouting]

443
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:51,664
[suspenseful music]

444
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,585
Take it off, they'll notice you.

445
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:05,242
[engine rumbling]

446
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:07,680
- Are we hiding?
- No.

447
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:11,335
- Where are we going?
- To get your dad back.

448
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:13,033
Are we scared?

449
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,994
No. Stay close.

450
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,043
[suspenseful music]

451
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,056
[Kwan] Keep your head down.

452
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,623
Don't look.

453
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,928
[suspenseful music continues]

454
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,321
[man]
Rising forward.

455
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:42,323
[man 2]
Keep moving!

456
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:07,435
[suspenseful music continues]

457
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:10,481
- Are we scared now?
- Strap in.

458
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:15,225
[suspenseful music continues]

459
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:20,491
- [ship engine blasting]
- [suspenseful music continues]

460
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:26,410
[dismayed shouting]

461
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:29,109
Everything's gonna be okay, Kes.

462
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,591
We're gonna get your dad now.

463
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:38,335
- Told you.
- [suspenseful music continues]

464
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:42,557
- [Laera] Oh, no, no.
- [suspenseful music continues]

465
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,646
[Kwan] No, we're
not gonna make it!

466
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,692
[Laera] Hold on!

467
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:51,740
- [ship engine blasting]
- [suspenseful music continues]

468
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:56,266
- Mom!
- [suspenseful music continues]

469
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:58,225
Mom!

470
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:02,011
- [Laera] Damn it!
- [suspenseful music continues]

471
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:07,103
- [ship engine powers down]
- [suspenseful music continues]

472
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:15,111
What are you doing?

473
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:16,678
Wait for my move,
then get Kessler out of here.

474
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:19,638
- Use the hatch.
- What about you?

475
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,248
It's worth enough
to get both of you

476
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:23,511
- on that transport.
- No.

477
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,121
Promise me you'll
get him on that ship.

478
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,820
Promise me you'll protect him.

479
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:30,561
- [banging on door]
- [Antares] Laera!

480
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,476
- No, they'll kill you.
- Mom?

481
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:34,957
[gentle music]

482
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:36,742
- [Antares] Open up, Laera!
- [gentle music continues]

483
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:40,920
- I'll see you soon.
- [gentle music continues]

484
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,573
[banging on door]

485
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,098
[Antares] Don't make
me torch this door.

486
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:47,753
There she is.

487
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,409
Smart girl, this
could have got messy.

488
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:57,545
- Laera, I'm sorry, I never--
- Give it up, it's not personal.

489
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,112
It is!

490
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:03,464
- [blows landing]
- [fighters grunting]

491
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,165
[Briggs] We found
Cobalt Team 80 meters

492
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:10,645
from the relay.

493
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:11,907
They were in the trees.

494
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:16,695
We observed plasma
scarring in the area.

495
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:19,523
I don't think they
saw it coming.

496
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,004
[Keyes] Thank you, Captain.

497
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:24,877
[Briggs] How would you
like to handle this?

498
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,140
The bodies, sir?

499
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,968
[Keyes] There are no bodies.

500
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:32,623
- I would list it as MIA.
- Sir.

501
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,452
- Let's go.
- [door closes]

502
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,636
You all right, Admiral?

503
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,857
No.

504
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:53,079
I understand.

505
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:55,995
It's a tragedy.

506
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:59,172
- Did you know...
- Pardon me?

507
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:03,480
Did you know that Master Chief's
suspicions were valid

508
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,396
when you sent our soldiers
out into a hostile--

509
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,442
I resent the implication.

510
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,400
I want to know what you knew,

511
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,054
and I want to know
when you knew it.

512
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:14,840
- Just calm down.
- Calm down?

513
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:19,148
The Covenant is on this planet!

514
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,063
It was a matter of time.

515
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,630
This day was inevitable.

516
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:24,066
It's mathematics, Admiral.

517
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:26,590
In every analysis,
every simulation--

518
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:28,549
This is not
a goddamn simulation!

519
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:31,378
Right, it's not.

520
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:34,598
But it's my job to
decide what to do next.

521
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,252
We have to alert command.

522
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:39,690
I assure you, your superiors
are already fully aware.

523
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,041
[scoffs]

524
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,697
We need to initiate
the Winter Contingency.

525
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,439
Begin immediate
civilian evacuation!

526
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:53,792
It's over, Admiral.
We don't get to win this one.

527
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:56,838
If you send out
an evacuation alert,

528
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:59,536
we'll have chaos, panic.

529
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:02,409
The Covenant element hit
Cobalt Team days ago.

530
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,672
We can only assume the Covenant
fleet isn't far behind.

531
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,675
There is a plan in place,

532
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:10,330
but it's going to require
some hard choices.

533
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:14,813
I need to know that
you're with me.

534
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:19,948
[tense music]

535
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:23,256
- We're not gonna fight.
- I didn't say that.

536
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:26,085
We're going to fight, we're
just not going to win.

537
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:29,915
[tense music continues]

538
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:31,699
- This is Reach.
- I know.

539
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,657
Home to millions of people--

540
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,007
And we will save what we can.

541
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:39,315
- This is my home!
- It is my home too!

542
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:42,928
Don't think for a second this
doesn't cost me everything.

543
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:46,453
[tense music continues]

544
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:51,675
- but this is reality, Admiral.
- [tense music continues]

545
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:54,504
We can either face it or we die.

546
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,680
[tense music continues]

547
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,900
Essential assets are
being transported

548
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,684
off the planet as we speak.

549
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,861
Get your things together.

550
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:05,864
- Tell no one.
- [tense music continues]

551
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,909
I won't run.

552
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:11,608
You'll fight another
day when we can win.

553
00:31:11,695 --> 00:31:13,784
[tense music continues]

554
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:19,051
Admiral Keyes,
can I count on you?

555
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:21,401
[tense music continues]

556
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:25,927
- Go fuck yourself.
- [tense music continues]

557
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,807
[Laera] Where's my husband?

558
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,897
- Is he alive?
- Antares?

559
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:42,596
- It's not too late, Antares.
- Yeah, it is.

560
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:46,078
[ship engines power up]

561
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:50,996
Go on, Kwan.

562
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,172
[tense music]

563
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:54,651
[voice clears throat]

564
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,397
[guard]
Halt.

565
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:02,355
[guard]
Wait.

566
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,096
Where's my mom?

567
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:08,970
- [tense music continues]
- [ship engine powers up]

568
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:13,235
- Will I see her soon?
- [tense music continues]

569
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:17,761
- Tell the truth.
- [tense music continues]

570
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:20,939
- Yes.
- [tense music continues]

571
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:33,212
- Best in the city. You want?
- No.

572
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:36,345
- Try it.
- No, thank you.

573
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:39,348
[diners chatter]

574
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,922
You've always had this problem.

575
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,533
You are not in control.

576
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,231
You mean not controllable.

577
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:54,450
We had an agreement.

578
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,931
You were to bring me
information, not attention.

579
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:58,933
I have information.

580
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,630
But I wanna know what you're
gonna do with it first.

581
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:05,331
We have a common
goal to win the war.

582
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,335
Don't mistake me for a friend.

583
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:14,427
- Okay.
- [diners chatter]

584
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,042
I believe the Covenant is here.

585
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:24,350
- In the ramen?
- On Reach.

586
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:31,835
You're serious.

587
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,750
A team of Spartans went missing.

588
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:36,144
FLEETCOM is pretending they
don't know what happened.

589
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,319
And do you think it's
the Covenant that--

590
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:39,191
I know it's the Covenant.

591
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,196
I suggest you consider
what you're saying.

592
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:46,067
That's all I've been doing.

593
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:47,938
I've been thinking it.
I've been saying it.

594
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,071
And nobody seems
to be listening.

595
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:53,814
- ONI knows!
- Keep your voice down.

596
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:57,122
[low] ONI knows.
They're covering it up.

597
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:59,820
Why would they do that?

598
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:02,214
The ONI protects itself.

599
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,780
Make them your enemy,

600
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,740
and it won't matter that
you're Master Chief,

601
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:09,090
you will cease to be useful.

602
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:11,353
And when you cease
to be useful, that--

603
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,227
- No, you're not listening,
- Why do you fight, John?

604
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:20,971
- What?
- You fight, why?

605
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,628
To win, to defend our home.

606
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,456
To preserve humanity.

607
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:32,548
No, you fight
because I tell you to.

608
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:36,509
You are a soldier, be a soldier.

609
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,426
This is what you will do.

610
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,689
Go back there.

611
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:44,647
Go back to FLEETCOM.

612
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,432
Kiss whatever ass
you have to kiss.

613
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,695
You go do your time in the brig.

614
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:49,913
Smile.

615
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,264
You'll never speak of it again.

616
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:54,831
They will probably
give you another medal.

617
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:58,444
[chair scrapes]

618
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:04,928
[tense music]

619
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:08,280
I need to know we
understand each other.

620
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:12,719
When exactly did you
leave ONI, Admiral?

621
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:16,026
If you walk out of here,
I won't be able to help you.

622
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,900
- You never left.
- Stand down, John.

623
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:22,642
I don't think so.

624
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,080
[tense music continues]

625
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:44,664
[Ackerson] I never understood
how fragile they really are.

626
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,059
Fragile?

627
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,236
Yes, because you
made them that way.

628
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:52,846
No.

629
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:54,195
You took them when
they were children.

630
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:56,371
You conditioned them.

631
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,025
And then when they were old
enough to think for themselves,

632
00:35:58,112 --> 00:36:00,549
you made sure they never would.

633
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:03,987
You put in those pellets.

634
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,033
So they never had to feel desire

635
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,560
or ambition or preference.

636
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:14,563
So they would never choose
anyone other than you.

637
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,698
And that's it, isn't it?

638
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,918
- Why are you here?
- I just came to say goodbye.

639
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,878
I'm leaving.

640
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:29,535
And I, I suppose
I wanted you to know

641
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:31,885
that your efforts weren't
in vain, Catherine,

642
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:33,582
you won't be here to see it.

643
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:39,109
But these things that you
made, broken as they may be,

644
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,763
they're going to
become the foundation

645
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,418
for something extraordinary.

646
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:49,555
And I hope that gives you
some comfort in the end.

647
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:53,298
[gentle music]

648
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,952
Don't you want to
know how she died?

649
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,174
[gentle music continues]

650
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,785
What?

651
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:07,877
Julia. Did you think I didn't
know who she was?

652
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:11,229
I remember all of them.

653
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:14,319
Especially your sister.

654
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:20,368
She was... she was so curious.

655
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:22,762
She used to ask
so many questions.

656
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,506
But you never know
who's going to make it through

657
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:31,727
the augmentation and who isn't.

658
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:34,643
- And she didn't.
- [gentle music continues]

659
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,906
- No.
- [gentle music continues]

660
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:39,474
She was dying.

661
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:46,264
She didn't know why.
She couldn't understand.

662
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:52,574
I told her more or less
what you just told me.

663
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:57,884
That even though
she wouldn't see it,

664
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:03,672
she would be this small part
of the next step forward.

665
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:07,023
I don't know if she understood.

666
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,461
She was so scared.

667
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,295
But I do know that she
loved you very much.

668
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,952
And I hope that gives
you some comfort.

669
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,391
[gentle music continues]

670
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:31,961
[soft chuckle]
Yeah.

671
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:42,494
[dramatic exhalation]

672
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:50,110
I thought you were leaving.

673
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,591
I didn't want you to be alone.

674
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:56,986
- I'm not a monster.
- [gentle music continues]

675
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:01,687
[tense music]

676
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:12,915
[Ackerson] I'll let
you two get reacquainted.

677
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:15,178
[tense music continues]

678
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:17,920
[steady, metallic pounding]

679
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:19,661
You are making it very
difficult for me to help you.

680
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:22,882
- Boss, we're exiting slip space.
- I heard you.

681
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,927
I let them have their way...

682
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:27,190
[dramatic chuckle]
...you'd already be dead.

683
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:28,627
We were good to you, Antares.

684
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,020
Oh. Well.

685
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:34,763
Thank you for
allowing me to barely exist

686
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,678
and to scrape out a meager
living split four ways

687
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:39,855
with these bozos while you
and your husband spent

688
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,770
- all that Madrigal money on--
- What are you talking about?

689
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:43,206
Don't play stupid!

690
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:44,730
I know you're not.

691
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:46,209
I can usually reason
with my husband,

692
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,124
but when he finds
out about this--

693
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:51,563
I'm not really worried.
Last I see Soren,

694
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,043
his was on a prison
ship headed for Reach.

695
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,089
So settle in.

696
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:59,397
It could be a while.

697
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:04,358
- You're a son of a bitch.
- No, I'm an opportunist.

698
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,929
[distant metallic clanking]

699
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:13,106
Now, where is it?

700
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:17,632
[distant clanking continues]

701
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,025
Would somebody please
deal with that?

702
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:21,114
I can't hear myself think.

703
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,551
[distant clanking continues]

704
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:24,813
Thank you.

705
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,555
[distant clanking continues]

706
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:29,905
I don't know what
Ruby Ann promised you,

707
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:32,081
but you are getting played,
Antares, and it's not too late.

708
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:37,391
Stop, please.

709
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,176
Soren tells you everything.

710
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:41,961
You know where he's stashed it.

711
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:44,267
- Stashed what?
- The treasure.

712
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:45,791
[Laera laughing]

713
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,619
You think this is funny?

714
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:52,711
Because I guarantee you...

715
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:56,541
[tense music]

716
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:57,629
...it's not.

717
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:03,417
What you call a treasure
was a box full

718
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,637
of deuterium tokens that wasn't
worth much to begin with.

719
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:10,990
- Heard enough.
- [tense music continues]

720
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:12,295
Ruby Ann doesn't want the money.

721
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:13,340
She wants The Rubble.

722
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:14,776
- [gun cocks]
- [Laera gasps]

723
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:18,519
- Calm down.
- [tense music continues]

724
00:41:18,606 --> 00:41:20,739
Why are you making me do this?

725
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:24,394
You think I want to
leave Kessler an orphan?

726
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,309
I love that kid.

727
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,268
She's laughing at you.

728
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:30,444
[distant clanking continues]

729
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:33,491
- You hear that sound?
- Yeah.

730
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:37,233
Yeah, you think you should
do something about it?

731
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,539
I'm watching.

732
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,410
[distant clanking continues]

733
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,239
Go see what's making that sound.

734
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:48,027
[distant clanking continues]

735
00:41:56,078 --> 00:41:58,167
- Where's the stash?
- She's stalling.

736
00:41:58,254 --> 00:42:00,430
Would you shut up?

737
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,084
I don't remember asking
anyone's opinion.

738
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:04,870
I'm the captain.

739
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:07,568
This is my ship,

740
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:11,224
and this is your
last chance, Laera.

741
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:13,443
[distant
clanking continues]

742
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,143
- Where is it?
- [tense music continues]

743
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,580
I can't tell you
because it doesn't exist.

744
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:22,365
And if it did exist,
I wouldn't tell you.

745
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:26,108
[tense music continues]

746
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:30,286
You've just taken
it outta my hands.

747
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:34,290
Just remember, I didn't
want what happens next.

748
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:37,816
[tense music continues]

749
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:47,956
- [dramatic music]
- [Laera groaning]

750
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,880
- [door beeping]
- [hydraulics hissing]

751
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:03,624
[tense music]

752
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:08,107
You have one minute
to rethink your position.

753
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:13,634
- [countdown beeping]
- [air hissing]

754
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:15,854
It doesn't have to be this way.

755
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:18,639
[Laera struggles to breathe]

756
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:20,989
Think of Kessler!

757
00:43:21,076 --> 00:43:24,384
With Soren on Reach,
who's gonna look after him?

758
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,299
- [Laera struggles to breathe]
- [tense music building]

- Kwan?
- [gentle music continues]

766
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,527
Kwan, I asked you a question--

772
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:41,548
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

773
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:42,897
'Cause then you'd be dead.

774
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:47,510
[gentle music continues]

775
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:51,863
[banging on door]

776
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,648
I need to speak
with Corporal Perez.

777
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,695
- She's not here.
- Where is she?

778
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,222
She's a good girl.

779
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:06,051
Yes, ma'am.

780
00:45:07,443 --> 00:45:11,143

Do you remember
what we talked about?

787
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:43,305
You asked me to...

788
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,268
To don't let them
take me alive?

789
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:52,271
Yeah, that's right.

790
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:55,970
Today's the day?

Oh, Julia.

00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:12,280
Never been in a church before,
have you?

Mnh-mnh.

807
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:19,157
People come here for comfort.

808
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:22,116
For protection.

809
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:26,033
For answers.

810
00:48:28,514 --> 00:48:29,907
Do they find them?

811
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:32,431
Sometimes.

812
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:35,913
Do you?

813
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:44,965
On Sanctuary,

814
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:48,403
before the Covenant came, I...

815
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,451
I saw something... in the fog.

816
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,154
You mean the woman?

[labored breathing]

818
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:06,117

Yes.

820
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:13,124
I don't sleep.

821
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,433
I can't get that
sound outta my head.

822
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:32,708
This is a recording
from Sanctuary.

823
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:36,451
It's not just interference.

824
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:37,757
Not just a sound.

825
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:41,195
