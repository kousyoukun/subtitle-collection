1
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:05,468
- You Bravo?
- Fog came in, comms went down.

2
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:07,209
Interference from the relay.

3
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:13,519
The Covenant was already there,

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,086
on Sanctuary
before they glassed it.

5
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:17,349
Perez.

6
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,525
<i>If your plan is to glass a
planet, why invade it first?</i>

7
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:21,005
Who the hell is this guy?

8
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,660
Mr. Ackerson is
Dr. Halsey's replacement.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,749
What do you think
they were after?

10
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:28,709
I think they were training
for something bigger.

11
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,667
He's got us escorting a tech
team on some fix-it mission.

12
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,495
What's he got you fixing?

13
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:33,714
Comms relay went down
in some nowhere system.

14
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:35,890
So why send Cobalt team?

15
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,153
Just tell 'em what they're
walking into. Tell Cobalt.

16
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:40,459
John, I never approved
of Halsey's methods.

17
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:42,157
- The Cortana system--
- No.

18
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:43,636
- Was never intended--
- You took her out.

19
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:45,900
I cannot authorize Silver Team

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,466
to perform combat operations.

21
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:50,034
You should have stayed with me.

22
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,906
<i>In exchange for asylum,</i>

23
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:55,518
these persons submit
to indentured service.

24
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:57,607
I don't know how it happened,

25
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:01,350
but the other families,
they're not afraid of you.

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,700
I have something you want!

27
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,050
<i>A bounty,
for Catherine Halsey.</i>

28
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,835
<i>I know where she is.</i>

29
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,314
Antares, what
the hell are you doing?

30
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:13,057
Soren-066?
You're under arrest.

31
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:15,364
<i>The only thing
the monster wants</i>

32
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:16,974
<i>is for you to know</i>

33
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:19,194
<i>that there's nothing
you can ever love</i>

34
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:21,500
<i>that it can't take away.</i>

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,328
<i>You believe me now,
don't you?</i>

36
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:40,563
Good afternoon.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,178
Two matcha tea cookies, two
macadamia nut, two shortbread--

38
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:49,833
And a blue nectarine tea.

39
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,921
It's my favorite.

40
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:54,795
Isn't it beautiful?

41
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:57,841
It's native only to Earth.

42
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:59,190
In seven months,
the orange flowers

43
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,844
are supposed to turn
into big red fruits,

44
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:02,541
and then when you take a bite,

45
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,413
the seeds just pop,
pop, pop in your mouth

46
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:06,371
like little balloons
filled with juice.

47
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,026
I also have this.

48
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:17,252
I think it's some kind of game.

49
00:02:17,252 --> 00:02:19,689
Oh, you already have one.

50
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,734
That's all right.

51
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:24,476
- Will you teach me?
- Yes.

52
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:28,350
But first I'd like
you to do something for me.

53
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,265
Of course.

54
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:32,963
I want you to tell me what
happens when you leave here.

55
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,749
Is that a problem?

56
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:39,840
I... I don't know
if I'm allowed to say.

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,842
Oh, I'm
sure it's all right.

58
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:45,541
There's another room.

59
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,936
- What kind of room?
- A big one.

60
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,633
I dunno what you'd call it.

61
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,071
What does this one do?

62
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:57,031
That allows the players
to bet on the outcome.

63
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:58,293
And then what happens?

64
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:00,948
We roll to see goes first?

65
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,951
No, what's beyond the room?

66
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,736
Oh, um, there's a hallway.

67
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:08,825
- Go on.
- There are many doors.

68
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:09,957
What's behind the doors?

69
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,134
I don't...

70
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:16,528
I'm not supposed to look.

71
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:18,617
Who told you not to look?

72
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,968
The man. I'll roll.

73
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:24,362
Tell me about him.

74
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,192
You'd like him, he's very nice.

75
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:31,543
He's the one who's been
sending you all the gifts.

76
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,901
I need you to tell me
about the man.

77
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,555
- My nose is bleeding.
- I know.

78
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,514
Tell me what he looks like.

79
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:47,385
I don't feel very good.

80
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:48,560
Tell me his name.

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,954
- I'm scared.
- I know.

82
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:54,131
The man, his name.

83
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:55,437
His name!

84
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:57,526
Tell me his name.

85
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:27,773
- What are you doing?
- Training.

86
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:30,863
You heard what Chief said.

87
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:32,604
How much longer are
you gonna keep this up?

88
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:35,085
They said I'm good to go.

89
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:39,916
Well, you could talk to
Ackerson, take some time,

90
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,571
- get a chance to--
- Time, for what?

91
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:45,269
To heal.

92
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:47,054
I don't even
notice it most days.

93
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,666
Well, we both know
that's not true.

94
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,624
I'm a Spartan, Kai.

95
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:53,756
We're at war.

96
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:59,849
You can put your pellet back in.

97
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:01,111
It will help with the pain.

98
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:06,856
They'll have to put
a bullet in me first.

99
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:21,218
How long are you planning
on staring at that thing?

100
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:26,832
Ackerson thinks there's
something wrong with me.

101
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,880
I never thought I'd miss Halsey.

102
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,188
It's like they don't trust us.

103
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:37,713
Do you?

104
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,629
Do I what?

105
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:42,196
Think there's something wrong?

106
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:47,244
It's only been
six months since...

107
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:48,941
since they took Cortana
out of your head.

108
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:51,161
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

109
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:54,860
I know you, John.

110
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,297
- We're more than just--
- I saw her.

111
00:05:58,386 --> 00:06:00,040
Who, you saw who?

112
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:09,005
Makee, on Sanctuary.

113
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:14,141
- Makee's dead.
- I know.

114
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,317
- I shot her myself.
- I know that.

115
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:19,189
Okay.

116
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,679
What are you doing?

117
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,292
- What?
-"Standby."

118
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:37,251
Why did
you change that?

119
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:39,122
Uh, well,
I think it means that--

120
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:41,298
They're still out there.
They haven't come back yet.

121
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:43,909
- You know that, right?
- Where's Cobalt?

122
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,824
- Look, I'm just doing my job.
- What's going on?

123
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:47,696
Yeah, that's what
we're trying to figure out.

124
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:50,046
What happened to Cobalt?

125
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:52,004
I have no idea.
They tell me

126
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:54,224
to change the board, so I,
I change the board.

127
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:57,184
Who tells you to change it?
Keyes, Ackerson?

128
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,537
Put that back.

129
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:22,617
Next.

130
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,862
Clive, we've got one.

131
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,044
Thank you, thank you.

132
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:23,068
Ah, come on.

133
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:26,115
Ah!

134
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,300
That doesn't belong to you.

135
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:42,653
But you belong to me.

136
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:44,307
You're indentured
to the Spiffs.

137
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:47,571
I don't think so.

138
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:51,880
Well,
your tag says otherwise.

139
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,887
Hey, stop!

140
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:00,280
Drop the gun!

141
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,542
Take the alley!

142
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,771
Stop, she's here!

143
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:14,816
She's here!

144
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,138
Ah!

145
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:50,547
Move!

146
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:01,515
She's there.
The disposal! Move!

147
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:24,233
Shut up. Did you hear that?

148
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,629
Take that side.

149
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,776
Animals.

150
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,880
Be a smart girl.

151
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,014
Ruby Ann bought Soren's
crew. he's not coming back.

152
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:17,329
Clive?

153
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:32,954
You slippery bitch.

154
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:36,610
That's a shame.
Now I won't even make it quick.

155
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:18,129
Stop.

156
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:19,217
I said stop.

157
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,440
How bad is it?

158
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,833
It's nothing.

159
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,574
You assholes.

160
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,227
At war your whole life,

161
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,360
surprised when
you break down.

162
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,884
- Let me help.
- Not here.

163
00:13:33,884 --> 00:13:36,496
I could recommend that
they pull your ass off the line.

164
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:38,628
And I could kill you.

165
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:40,630
There she is.

166
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,066
Relax, no one's looking.

167
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,503
How would you know?

168
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:52,947
- That hurt?
- No.

169
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:54,688
Dick!

170
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:56,820
- Be nice.
- Don't let them see.

171
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,692
It's cool, I got you.

172
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,522
Thanks.

173
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:04,915
You know you can't
do this forever.

174
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:06,743
Spartans never die.

175
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:08,484
I'm serious.

176
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:10,138
There's other things to be,

177
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:11,531
other ways to live.

178
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,315
You ever think about that?

179
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:15,622
Think about what?

180
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:18,059
Life without
all this Spartan shit.

181
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,104
You mean a life
that doesn't matter?

182
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:25,545
Louis, I'm sorry, I didn't--

183
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:26,894
- It's all right.
- I didn't mean...

184
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:29,679
I know how you assholes think.

185
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,115
I was you once.

186
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:32,682
You were great.

187
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:34,292
You were the best.

188
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:36,164
Don't blow smoke up my ass.

189
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,298
But it's true.

190
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:42,692
I wish you were
out there with us.

191
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:44,564
Yeah, I used
to wish that too.

192
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:48,045
What changed?

193
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,397
You wouldn't understand.

194
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,751
Where's Cobalt?

195
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:00,536
Do you want a drink?

196
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:02,669
I don't drink.

197
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,322
No, of course not.

198
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:06,716
What about food?
Do you eat?

199
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:08,326
What happened to Cobalt?

200
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:11,460
Are they still alive?

201
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,854
Well, as far as I know,
Spartans never die.

202
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,250
Clear us for action, or
I'll find somebody who will.

203
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,688
Are you threatening to
go over my head, John?

204
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:28,346
You like a hierarchy,
I respect that.

205
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:30,261
But make no mistake here, John.

206
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:33,177
The ONI is running the show.

207
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:36,441
And I am the ONI.

208
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:44,885
You sure I can't get
you something, hm?

209
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,280
Then allow me to be direct.

210
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,067
Your account of events on
Sanctuary has proven dubious.

211
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,634
What?

212
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,375
We were unable
to corroborate it.

213
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,856
Well, talk to that corporal,
Perez, she was there.

214
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:01,815
Yes, I did.
We spoke at length,

215
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:05,035
but these things
that you insist happened,

216
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,863
Covenant Elites
wiping out Marines?

217
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:08,604
Those Marines are dead.

218
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:10,214
What do you think
happened to them?

219
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:12,956
I think the Covenant
glassed the planet.

220
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:16,612
I think it was
a terrible tragedy.

221
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,614
But the fact remains,
the corporal

222
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:20,877
did not confirm your story.

223
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:22,836
What are you talking about?

224
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:24,838
What does that mean?

225
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:29,059
It means she has
absolutely no recollection

226
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,626
of what you say you
encountered on Sanctuary.

227
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:31,888
That's impossible.

228
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,022
She's lying.

229
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:44,205
Put yourself in
my position, John.

230
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,601
Given your recent behavior,
would you trust you?

231
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:54,563
Can't win this war
without us, sir.

232
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,565
You're right.

233
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:59,873
I need Master Chief.
We all do.

234
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:05,443
But John,
at the end of the day...

235
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:07,924
he's just a guy in a suit.

236
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:24,375
I brought you food.

237
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:27,030
What's wrong?

238
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:41,828
Laera, what are you
doing down here?

239
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,351
I told you I'd come get you
when the ship was ready.

240
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:44,613
You said it would
be ready today.

241
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,093
Yeah, I know what I said.

242
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:49,183
Um... we found a problem.

243
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:50,314
We found a crack in
the stream manifold.

244
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:52,316
How long?

245
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:53,753
There's a lot of debris
around that cargo ship,

246
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:55,319
took more hits than we realized.

247
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,539
- How long?
- It's hard to say.

248
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,062
A couple of days, maybe more.

249
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,765
We're doing
the best we can here.

250
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:07,201
You should go upstairs
and get some rest.

251
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:10,160
Soren never would've
left any of you behind.

252
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,642
That cargo ship was
in a decaying orbit.

253
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:17,646
We got hit, lost the gyro.
It was either detach or--

254
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:19,039
You said that.

255
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:24,174
- How's Kessler doing?
- Kessler's fine.

256
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,961
This sort of thing's
pretty hard on a kid.

257
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:31,660
- Soren is not dead.
- No, of course not.

258
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,488
He's alive,
do you understand me?

259
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,185
Yes.

260
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:38,275
Laera, we all
wanna find Soren.

261
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:40,364
You know this isn't
the only ship on the Rubble.

262
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:42,018
This is Soren's ship!

263
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:45,892
Your captain.

264
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:50,635
Wait.

265
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:56,032
<i>What happened to your ear?</i>

266
00:18:57,773 --> 00:18:59,862
Did I do something wrong?

267
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:03,387
Kwan?

268
00:19:03,387 --> 00:19:06,042
No, it's grown-up stuff.

269
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:08,915
I know grown-up stuff.

270
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:15,182
- I have to go.
- Why?

271
00:19:15,182 --> 00:19:18,663
Because... I just do.

272
00:19:18,663 --> 00:19:20,970
Bad people
are looking for you?

273
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,711
How do you--

274
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:23,973
I told you
I know grown-up things.

275
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,717
- You don't know anything.
- You're in danger.

276
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:30,806
You, your mom--

277
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:33,504
When my dad comes
back, he'll protect us.

278
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:35,332
He's not coming back!

279
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,079
Kessler.

280
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:30,692
- <i>Riz, I see you.</i>
- Shit!

281
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:32,476
Too slow.

282
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:34,783
I have PID on target,
taking the shot.

283
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:36,524
Chief!

284
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:49,145
Game over.

285
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:53,062
Tell me, what is it like?

286
00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:56,370
- What?
- Losing, I wouldn't know.

287
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,894
- You're insufferable.
- Because I've never lost.

288
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:00,156
- Yeah, I get it.
- So for me,

289
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:02,332
it'll be a new experience.

290
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:04,552
- Chief, make him stop.
- We're going again.

291
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:07,120
- Riz, you're up.
- Copy.

292
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,339
- Well, I can go, Chief.
- I said Riz.

293
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:10,645
- Chief!
- What?

294
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:13,778
Look at her.

295
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:16,564
Hey, you good?

296
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:17,739
Yes, Master Chief.

297
00:21:24,354 --> 00:21:25,877
Something you wanna say?

298
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:51,686
Come on.

299
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:55,168
- Vannak.
- I got her.

300
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:08,964
I have PID on target.

301
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:14,100
Come on, come on.

302
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:51,876
Riz!

303
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,235
Get up.

304
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:08,154
- Don't you quit.
- Chief.

305
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,460
- Get up!
- I can't.

306
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,114
You've gotta stop pushing her,

307
00:23:12,114 --> 00:23:14,421
we've been out here
all night training, why?

308
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:16,640
Because they're training!

309
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,294
I told you what I
saw on Sanctuary.

310
00:23:18,294 --> 00:23:20,644
Our enemy is out there.

311
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:23,212
They're getting close,
I can prove it.

312
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:25,562
How are you gonna do that?

313
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:27,216
I'm gonna find Cobalt.

314
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:30,219
Run it again.

315
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,977
Again.

316
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:50,979
The game's over.

317
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:53,024
But we're playing to 50.

318
00:23:53,024 --> 00:23:55,026
I got over 50.

319
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:57,333
I turned the doubling
cube each round,

320
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,075
and you accepted every time.

321
00:24:00,075 --> 00:24:03,034
Sometimes taking a small loss

322
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:05,646
is better than trying to win.

323
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,038
I understand.

324
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:09,519
Who's the man
who sent you here?

325
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,393
How do you know about him?

326
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:16,091
Well, these lovely gifts.

327
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:17,397
Someone must be
giving them to you.

328
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,618
It won't stop.

329
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:23,098
Tell me about the man.

330
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:25,709
He's...

331
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:27,450
Yes,
you said he's nice.

332
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,582
Yes, but describe him.

333
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:30,018
What's happening to me?

334
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:31,280
You're dying.

335
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:35,632
What?
Did I do something wrong?

336
00:24:35,632 --> 00:24:37,068
Look at me, look at me.

337
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,377
- I'm scared.
- I know.

338
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:43,901
- I'm very scared.
- Tell me his name.

339
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:46,469
Tell me the man, his name.

340
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:55,609
What's the point in this?

341
00:25:03,443 --> 00:25:05,836
Riz, relax.
You're good.

342
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:09,318
I shouldn't be here.

343
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:10,928
He's the only guy
that can help you.

344
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,539
How would you know that?

345
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:13,496
'Cause he's
the one who saved me.

346
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:18,240
Look, when we came
outta augmentation...

347
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,808
I felt completely new.

348
00:25:23,332 --> 00:25:25,682
Even when people
started getting sick,

349
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:27,771
I was invincible.

350
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:30,339
After a couple of days,

351
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:32,385
there was this darkness
at the edge of my vision.

352
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:36,040
I just pretended
like it wasn't there.

353
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:39,435
But it grew...

354
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:42,395
and it grew.

355
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:45,920
I never told anybody.

356
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:49,532
You could have told me.

357
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:52,448
- No, I couldn't.
- Why not?

358
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:55,451
'Cause then you'd know
I wasn't one of you.

359
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:58,367
I knew I only had a few days.

360
00:25:58,367 --> 00:25:59,542
I didn't wanna be
somebody going blind.

361
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:03,329
I wanted to be a Spartan.

362
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:07,420
Even if just for a little while.

363
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:13,295
You know, the last day I
could really see anything...

364
00:26:14,818 --> 00:26:16,211
I remember looking
at all of you...

365
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:19,519
how proud you were...

366
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,349
how beautiful.

367
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,574
Then it all went dark.

368
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:35,883
Be well.

369
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:38,755
Who's this?

370
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:41,932
She's a friend.

371
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:43,194
Hello, friend.

372
00:26:47,547 --> 00:26:50,637
<i>I am a bit
worried about John.</i>

373
00:26:50,637 --> 00:26:54,162
<i>Not Master Chief,
but John the man.</i>

374
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:57,165
And I know how long
you've been together.

375
00:26:57,165 --> 00:26:58,949
I know you care about him.

376
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,649
In fact, I venture to say

377
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:05,565
you probably know him
better than anyone.

378
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:08,829
- Do you agree?
- Well, I--

379
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:11,135
I thought
perhaps you might help me

380
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:13,964
to help him.

381
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:16,358
Is that something
you could do?

382
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,448
Of course.

383
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:25,062
<i>Have you
witnessed any behavior</i>

384
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:28,457
<i>that might indicate John could
be a threat to his team...</i>

385
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:30,981
or, God forbid, to himself?

386
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,075
No, sir.

387
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:41,818
That's a relief.

388
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:51,567
I just think it's a lot, sir.

389
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:55,441
<i>Carrying everything he carries,
seeing everything he's seen.</i>

390
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,747
Like what they did to him, sir.

391
00:28:01,925 --> 00:28:03,536
I just wonder sometimes...

392
00:28:06,582 --> 00:28:08,671
if he can let
the past become the past.

393
00:28:10,717 --> 00:28:13,763
Do you have concerns
about John's mental state?

394
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:23,164
No. Absolutely not, sir.

395
00:28:23,164 --> 00:28:26,950
The chief is solid.
He's the best we've got.

396
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,912
Well, I certainly understand
what he sees in you.

397
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:34,915
Thank you, sir.

398
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:37,526
I only hope he
values your loyalty.

399
00:28:40,224 --> 00:28:42,183
Will that be all?

400
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:43,576
Yes, dismissed.

401
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:49,277
My door is always open, Kai.

402
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:56,415
Why didn't you tell
Ackerson what you saw?

403
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:57,633
I'm sorry, this
isn't a good time.

404
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:59,287
No.

405
00:29:00,462 --> 00:29:02,072
Abuela, just go
back inside, okay?

406
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:04,074
Everybody's waiting.

407
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:07,382
He was just about to leave.

408
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,646
You are very large.

409
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:13,083
Yes, ma'am.

410
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,085
He's someone I work with.

411
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:18,088
You were there
on that planet with Talia?

412
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,744
Yes.

413
00:29:21,744 --> 00:29:23,354
Why are you standing out here?

414
00:29:23,354 --> 00:29:25,139
Come and join us,

415
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,445
we have a table full
of food up on the roof.

416
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:44,854
You're not the first
to come see me.

417
00:29:44,854 --> 00:29:49,032
You warriors think your
scars are on the outside,

418
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:50,643
but they're not.

419
00:29:57,954 --> 00:29:59,129
What is that?

420
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:06,963
What is that?

421
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,532
That's just your pain.

422
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:13,100
It's okay.

423
00:30:14,623 --> 00:30:15,581
Let it go.

424
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:21,151
Your life is yours.

425
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:22,588
It belongs to you.

426
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:27,593
I promise you,

427
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:28,681
it's yours.

428
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,198
<i>A ver,</i>

429
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:10,331
make sure our guest
gets enough to eat.

430
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:16,250
What's the story
with you two? Hmm? Hmm?

431
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,817
Can we just eat, please?

432
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:19,645
Look at this guy,

433
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,211
he must have women
climbing all over him.

434
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:23,126
Probably some men too.

435
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:25,825
Hey,
mind your business.

436
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:28,828
Come on, Talia never
brought anyone home before.

437
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:30,960
I didn't bring him home.

438
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,223
Yeah, and I think we all
deserve to know if they're...

439
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:34,877
Antonio?

440
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:36,792
<i>Basta,</i> Antonio.

441
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:40,448
Sorry.

442
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:43,320
Hey, what's your KDR?

443
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:47,498
Kill-Death ratio.

444
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:49,805
Come on, man, you don't
play Spartan Attack?

445
00:31:49,805 --> 00:31:50,850
I don't keep score.

446
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:07,910
Think I almost peed myself.

447
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:13,089
I told you,
he's one of them!

448
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:15,091
Oh! I'm calling Beto.

449
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:16,789
- No.
- Yeah, you should.

450
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:18,617
What? We have
a Spartan at our table.

451
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:20,053
Of course I'm gonna call him.

452
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,578
I'd like
to make a toast.

453
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:29,410
To Talia and her Marines,

454
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,238
and the Spartans.

455
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:34,894
We thank God for
their sacrifices.

456
00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:37,548
To Talia.

457
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:39,376
<i>- Salud.</i>
- Talia.

458
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:41,727
Little cousin who kicked
some serious Covenant ass.

459
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,079
Hey, what's your problem?

460
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,558
Way to go, asshole.

461
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:48,690
What did I do?

462
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,915
The comms
went down around the relay.

463
00:32:55,915 --> 00:32:58,047
I couldn't figure out
what was causing it.

464
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:04,967
I was scanning the band and...

465
00:33:07,274 --> 00:33:08,492
I heard something...

466
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:12,148
in the interference.

467
00:33:12,148 --> 00:33:13,541
What did you hear?

468
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:14,673
I don't know.

469
00:33:16,587 --> 00:33:18,372
I just knew we weren't alone.

470
00:33:21,854 --> 00:33:23,551
I knew there was
something out there.

471
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,381
I could feel it,

472
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,730
and Rand could feel it.

473
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:32,516
And I didn't see anything.

474
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,564
And now all my guys are gone.

475
00:33:37,957 --> 00:33:39,132
How do you explain that?

476
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:44,703
How do you explain why that
thing didn't kill me?

477
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:46,139
'Cause it should've killed me.

478
00:33:56,323 --> 00:33:58,368
That's why I didn't
tell Ackerson.

479
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,247
They gave me a medal.

480
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,251
I still don't know
what it's for.

481
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:16,473
Surviving?

482
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,130
Is that all I did?

483
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,307
No.

484
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:35,014
You heard a message.
This will happen again.

485
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:41,977
You'll think about it every day.

486
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:47,026
Their faces pop up
when you least expect.

487
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:50,072
Doesn't get better.

488
00:34:53,902 --> 00:34:55,425
Just gets further away.

489
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:13,095
It is strange.

490
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:15,750
The clones all
described a nice man.

491
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:19,667
And yet here you are.

492
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,800
Well, we both knew
I'd be here someday.

493
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,894
There was a pomegranate tree
in my father's garden

494
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,069
in Port Vernon.

495
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:35,248
He spent years cultivating it,

496
00:35:35,248 --> 00:35:38,991
even though they're
not native to Endymion.

497
00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:41,994
And he used to wake me up
a couple of hours

498
00:35:41,994 --> 00:35:45,911
before sunrise every day
to till the garden.

499
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:49,044
I resented him for this, I
thought the work was beneath me.

500
00:35:49,044 --> 00:35:54,702
And I remember one evening
there was a lightning storm,

501
00:35:54,702 --> 00:36:00,099
and I snuck out of my room,
and I set his tree on fire.

502
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,231
He never suspected
I had anything to do with it.

503
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,759
I have never told
anyone that story...

504
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:14,635
and yet somehow that tree...

505
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,248
There's only one person
who could know about it.

506
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:23,122
I assure you, any resemblance
is pure coincidence.

507
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,039
Where is she?

508
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,216
- Cortana? She's secure.
- Where's John?

509
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:32,653
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

510
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:34,611
What is it you want from me?

511
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:41,618
What I want is
to introduce you to someone.

512
00:36:44,795 --> 00:36:46,536
This is Julia.

513
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:49,670
She'll be your attendant.

514
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,370
I'm sure you two will enjoy
getting to know each other.

515
00:36:57,504 --> 00:36:58,635
Your tree.

516
00:37:47,423 --> 00:37:49,208
Show me the flight plan
for Cobalt team's mission.

517
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:54,213
<i>No missions
associated with that call sign.</i>

518
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:58,391
Show me all Spartan
flight plans.

519
00:37:58,391 --> 00:38:00,959
<i>Displaying Spartan flight plans.</i>

520
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:10,620
Hello, Cortana.

521
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,362
<i>Hello, Colonel Ackerson.</i>

522
00:38:13,362 --> 00:38:15,930
<i>Did you find the information
I provided useful?</i>

523
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,411
Quite, thank you.

524
00:38:18,411 --> 00:38:19,934
<i>Is there anything else
you would like to know</i>

525
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:21,980
<i>about Dr. Halsey?</i>

526
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,330
No, we can save that for later.

527
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:32,251
So, have you made any progress
with the problem I gave you?

528
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:35,645
<i>Yes, but it's
a complex simulation.</i>

529
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:37,734
<i>I could provide you with
a more accurate analysis</i>

530
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:39,998
<i>if you could give me
access to external systems.</i>

531
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:41,434
Well, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

532
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:43,044
<i>Oh.</i>

533
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:43,914
But give
it your best shot,

534
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:45,394
even with a margin for error,

535
00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:47,875
there's value
to your projections.

536
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,008
<i>Based on the data
available to me,</i>

537
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:53,228
<i>there's a 97% probability.</i>

538
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,018
And with the data
you've been given,

539
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:02,237
are there any viable
strategies you would recommend

540
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:04,544
to prevent that outcome?

541
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:06,459
<i>All of my simulations
return the same result</i>

542
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:09,592
<i>regardless of any action taken.</i>

543
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:11,246
I see.

544
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,774
So there's nothing to be done.

545
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:19,907
<i>I can continue
to run simulations.</i>

546
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:23,650
No, that won't be necessary.

547
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,565
<i>Are you
leaving already?</i>

548
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:27,175
Yeah.

549
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:29,569
I'll try and visit again.

550
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:31,484
<i>But you won't.</i>

551
00:39:31,484 --> 00:39:33,877
<i>You can't.</i>

552
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:35,009
<i>According to the simulations.</i>

553
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:36,141
I know.

554
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:40,014
It's just something people say.

555
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:50,068
Crosscheck
communications relays.

556
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:53,158
<i>There are
two active missions.</i>

557
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:57,597
<i>Meridian relay,
standard crew rotation.</i>

558
00:39:57,597 --> 00:40:00,600
<i>Unknown mission,
Epsilon Eridane system.</i>

559
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,298
Zoom in.

560
00:40:08,303 --> 00:40:11,089
<i>Mission time, 81 hours.</i>

561
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:12,916
- Identify call sign.
- <i>No call sign</i>

562
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:15,397
<i>associated with
this flight plan.</i>

563
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:18,748
They never left the planet.

564
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:21,621
<i>Hotel Victor 3-2,
this is Reach Flight Bravo.</i>

565
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:24,754
<i>You are cleared for Sector
Longhorn, heading 2-4-9'er.</i>

566
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:27,017
<i>Copy that, Bravo.
3-2 out.</i>

567
00:40:31,892 --> 00:40:34,199
<i>Autopilot disengaged, new course.</i>

568
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:44,992
- No training?
- What's going on?

569
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:47,386
I thought we were going
to Longhorn Valley.

570
00:40:47,386 --> 00:40:48,822
I was looking forward to
turning you all into chump bait.

571
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,129
- Change of plans.
- What?

572
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:54,306
- Where are we going?
- Visegrad Relay. Riz.

573
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:58,092
The comms array
on Sanctuary went down

574
00:40:58,092 --> 00:41:01,530
just before
the Covenant attacked.

575
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,272
Visegrad went down a few days
ago, and they sent Cobalt.

576
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:07,057
We're going to get 'em back.

577
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:11,279
So we're cleared for combat?

578
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:16,937
Affirmative.
Vic, ready.

579
00:41:16,937 --> 00:41:19,069
Vannak, conduct PCIs.

580
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:21,115
You got it, Chief.

581
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,212
What exactly is the mission?

582
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:37,392
The Covenant's on Reach.

583
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:46,967
Halt!

584
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:48,534
Make ready.

585
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,580
Jesus.

586
00:41:56,585 --> 00:41:57,891
Steady.

587
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:12,688
Cease fire! Cease fire!

588
00:42:12,688 --> 00:42:14,516
Cease fire!

589
00:42:14,516 --> 00:42:17,693
Oh, shit.

590
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:19,042
First squad.

591
00:42:25,397 --> 00:42:26,267
Easy.

592
00:42:41,717 --> 00:42:43,545
First squad, sit-rep!

593
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:46,722
Second squad, go!

594
00:42:55,035 --> 00:42:56,341
Contact!

595
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:17,144
Enough!

596
00:43:25,544 --> 00:43:30,070
There's no honor in this fight.

597
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,158
Door.

598
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:36,206
Please.
