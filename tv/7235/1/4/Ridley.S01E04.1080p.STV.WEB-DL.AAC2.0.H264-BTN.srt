00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,960
警报声响起。来吧。
ALARM BLARES Rise and shine. Come on.

2
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,520
来吧。
Come on.

3
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,400
囚犯喊叫
PRISONERS SHOUT

4
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,800
汽车驶来
CAR APPROACHES

5
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,360
教堂钟声响起
CHURCH BELLS TOLL

6
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,320
嘿，卡尔。
Hey, Cal.

7
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,439
很高兴见到你。
Good to see you.

8
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,880
你看起来很好。
You're looking well.

9
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,680
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

10
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,680
干得好。
Good job.

11
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,279
我们的姐姐，格洛丽亚-弗兰纳里，迈克尔和卡尔的挚爱母亲，
Our sister, Gloria Flannery, beloved mother of Michael and Cal,

12
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,560
已经在基督那里得到了安息。
has gone to her rest in peace with Christ.

13
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,679
愿主现在欢迎她到天堂里上帝的孩子们的餐桌。
May the Lord now welcome her to the table of God's children in heaven.

14
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,559
愿我们这些哀悼的人有一天能与格洛丽亚团聚。
May we who mourn be reunited one day with Gloria.

15
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,479
愿我们一起迎接基督耶稣
Together may we meet Christ Jesus

16
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,400
当他是我们的生命在荣耀中出现时。
when He who is our life appears in glory.

17
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,919
迈克尔。该走了。
Michael. Time to go.

18
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,120
只是......让我和我的兄弟谈一谈。
Just... give me a minute with my brother.

19
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,520
卡尔。你必须保持... 为我保持坚强。好吗？
Cal. You have to stay... stay strong for me. OK?

20
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,039
我保证 我保证。
Promise. I promise.

21
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,080
好孩子。
Good lad.

22
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,279
你能来真好，雷德利。哦，来吧。
So nice of you to come, Ridley. Oh, come on.

23
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,599
你知道我会来的。
You knew I'd be here.

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,080
这让她完蛋了。她的大儿子在监狱里。
It finished her. Her eldest boy in prison.

25
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,719
把她送进了一个早期的坟墓。
Sent her to an early grave.

26
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,159
你现在才想到这种事，有点晚了。
You're a bit late thinking about things like that.

27
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,360
螺丝钉甚至不让我留下来守夜。
The screws won't even let me stay for the wake.

28
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,559
我，呃，我看到亚当-唐纳利的一些同伙已经出现了。
I, er, I see some of Adam Donnelly's associates have showed up.

29
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,480
你去吧。
On you go.

30
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
汽车驶来
CAR APPROACHES

31
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,120
音乐响起，交谈声
MUSIC PLAYS, CHATTER

32
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,000
哦，看看这是谁！
Oh, look who it is!

33
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,359
看看这是谁！弗兰姆利仙女!
Look who it is! The Framley Fairy!

34
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,800
你藏到哪里去了？
Where have you been hiding?

35
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
轰！轰！轰
Boom!

36
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,240
响亮的敲门声
LOUD KNOCKING

37
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,840
敲门声继续
KNOCKING CONTINUES

38
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,759
争吵
ARGUING

39
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,119
离我远点。放开我！
Get off me. Get off!

40
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,999
Agh!
Agh!

41
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
响亮的撞击声
LOUD THUD

42
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,080
警察的无线电聊天
POLICE RADIO CHATTER

43
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,479
早上好。你没事吧？
Morning. You all right?

44
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,519
男性死亡。我们已经确认他是帕特里克-艾略特。
Male fatality. We've IDed him as Patrick Elliot.

45
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,359
住在十楼的一个公寓里。看门人今天早上发现了他。
Lived in a flat on the tenth floor. Caretaker found him this morning.

46
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,919
他整晚都在那里吗？尸体藏在这些灌木丛后面。
Has he been there all night? Body was hidden behind these bushes.

47
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,599
好的。开始四处打听。看看邻居们能不能给我们点启示。
OK. Start asking around. See if the neighbours can enlighten us.

48
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,239
我怀疑有人会跟我们说话，像这样的庄园。
I doubt anyone's gonna talk to us, an estate like this.

49
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,680
好吧，如果有人能吸引他们，达伦，我敢肯定是你。
Well, if anyone can charm them, Darren, I'm sure it's you.

50
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,200
纽斯通医生。
Dr Newstone.

51
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,439
凹陷性颅骨骨折。大脑挫伤。几根断骨。
Depressed skull fracture. Cerebral contusion. Several broken bones.

52
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,079
从任何高度坠落后的典型伤害模式。
Typical injury patterns after a fall from any height.

53
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,879
知道什么时候发生的吗？他已经死了好几个小时了。
Any idea when it happened? He's been dead for a few hours.

54
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,039
我想是昨天傍晚的某个时候。
I'd say sometime late yesterday evening.

55
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,319
我们认为他可能是跳楼了吗？
Do we think he could have jumped?

56
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,999
不太可能。颈部和躯干上部有一些瘀伤。
Unlikely. There's some bruising to the neck and upper torso,

57
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,439
与从任何高度坠落的情况不一致。他的衬衫也有破损。
inconsistent with a fall from any height. And a tear to his shirt.

58
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,079
这两点都表明有挣扎的迹象。
Both of which point to a struggle.

59
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,999
我们正在清查阳台。可能会给我们一些线索
We're doing a sweep of the balcony. Might give us some leads.

60
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,680
Ridley已经在上面了 谢谢。
Ridley's already up there. Thanks.

61
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
雷德利。卡罗尔。
Ridley. Carol.

62
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,159
所以，没有强行进入的迹象。他把这个地方锁上了，并闩上了门。
So, no sign of a forced entry. He kept the place locked and bolted.

63
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,479
看起来他有理由这样做。是的。那油漆不新鲜。
Looks like he had cause to. Yeah. That paint's not fresh.

64
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,400
也许是有人怀恨在心。
Somebody bearing a grudge, maybe.

65
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,159
那么，我们在想什么？ 抢劫？
So, what are we thinking - a robbery?

66
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,440
我不知道。如果是抢劫，他们就会拿走那个钱包。
I dunno. If it's a robbery, they'd have taken that wallet.

67
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,879
看起来他在杜松子诊所工作。
Looks like he worked at The Juniper Practice,

68
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,200
在Burmanton的那个治疗中心。临床心理学家。
that therapy centre up in Burmanton. Clinical psychologist.

69
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,639
那你和帕特里克-埃利奥特有多熟？
How well did you know Patrick Elliot, then?

70
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,759
住在我的楼层。
Lived on my floor.

71
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,999
住在我那层楼里。和他没有太多关系。
Few flats along. Didn't really have too much to do with him.

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,039
你昨天晚上有没有见到他？我在电梯旁撞见了他。
Did you see him at all last night? I bumped into him just by the lifts.

73
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,759
那是什么时候？我当时出去工作了。
And what time was this? I was off out to work.

74
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,599
一定是在七点之前。有人和他在一起吗？
Must have been just before seven. And was anybody with him?

75
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,159
没有，他肯定是自己一个人。有伙伴吗？
No. He was definitely on his own. What about a partner?

76
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,479
有什么人是我们要找的吗？
Anyone we should be talking to?

77
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,079
他并不缺少来电者。
He wasn't short of callers.

78
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,679
他们整天来来往往。我不能告诉你任何名字。
Coming and going all hours, they were. Couldn't give you any names.

79
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,240
那你在哪里工作？在社区中心。
Where is it you work, then? At the community centre.

80
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,919
需要我的时候就去帮忙。你知道，让孩子们远离麻烦。
Help out when I'm needed. You know, keep the kids out of trouble.

81
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,959
我们说的是什么样的麻烦？
What kind of trouble are we talking about?

82
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,359
就是一般的恶作剧。
Just the usual shenanigans.

83
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,000
他们在这里没有什么可做的。
Not much for 'em to do round here.

84
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,239
嘿... ... 他跳下去了，是吗？
Hey... jumped, did he?

85
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,599
你怎么会这么说？
What makes you say that?

86
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,880
他总是把世界的重量扛在肩上。
Always had the weight of the world on his shoulders.

87
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,359
我们在阳台上发现了两组鞋印。
We found two sets of shoe prints on the balcony.

88
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,119
地板上的这些擦痕，肯定是挣扎的痕迹。
These scuff marks on the floor, definite signs of a struggle.

89
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,879
我们将进行模式识别测试。
And we'll run a pattern recognition test,

90
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,999
但其中一个很可能是属于袭击者的。
but it's likely one of them belongs to our assailant.

91
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,039
还有什么我们可以利用的吗？
Is there anything else we can work with?

92
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,039
我们提取了一个手掌印，在玻璃外面。
We lifted a palm print, outside of the glass.

93
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,079
我们需要将其与死者的指纹进行比对。
We'll need to run it for a match with the deceased.

94
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,839
那么，他在阳台上，然后呢？他被催促了，是这样吗？
So, he's on the balcony, and what? He gets rushed, is that it?

95
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,479
他们必须很强壮才能把他推到边缘。
They'd have to be pretty strong to have pushed him over the edge.

96
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,519
血液突然涌向大脑会释放各种内啡肽。
Sudden rush of blood to the brain releases all sorts of endorphins.

97
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,599
所以，他失去了平衡。
So, he loses his balance,

98
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,279
试图阻止自己跌倒。
tries to stop himself from falling.

99
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,480
但到了那个阶段，已经太晚了。
But by that stage, it's too late.

100
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,999
嗨，我在找227房间。
Hi, I'm looking for room 227.

101
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,679
是的，就在你的左边。好的。谢谢你。
Yeah, just up there on your left. OK. Thank you.

102
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,680
哦，对不起。对不起。
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

103
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,319
哦，亲爱的，我很抱歉。我找不到一个停车位，而且... ...
Oh, babe, I'm so sorry. I couldn't get a parking space and...

104
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,159
她叹气
SHE SIGHS

105
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,600
我们要有一个小女儿了。真的吗？
We're going to have a little girl. Really?

106
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,040
哦，她太漂亮了。
Oh! She is gorgeous.

107
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,960
她就在那里！他们笑着说
She's there! THEY CHUCKLE

108
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,359
杜松子诊所是一个注册的慈善机构。
The Juniper Practice is a registered charity.

109
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,879
缓刑令，呃，法庭转介，大量的前罪犯。
Probation orders, erm, court referrals, plenty of ex-offenders.

110
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,839
是的，我们可能偷了他们中的一些人。
Yeah, we've probably nicked a few of them.

111
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,840
是的。他们报名参加咨询，为他们赢得了提前释放的机会。
Yeah. They sign up for counselling, earns them an early release.

112
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,639
帕特里克-埃利奥特在这个诊所工作了多长时间？
How long had Patrick Elliot been working at the practice?

113
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,279
他大约五年前加入我们。
He joined us around five years ago.

114
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,799
我亲自面试过他的工作。
I interviewed him myself for the job.

115
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,439
那你一定很了解他了？
Must have known him pretty well, then?

116
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,319
诊所的午餐。
Practice lunches.

117
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,879
下班后偶尔喝点酒。他昨天在工作吗？
Occasional drink after work. Was he working yesterday?

118
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,079
他下午来拿一些案件资料，很晚了。
He came in for some case files, late afternoon.

119
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,159
一个多星期以来我们第一次交谈。
First time we'd spoken in over a week.

120
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,240
所以他没有看任何病人？
So he hadn't been seeing any patients?

121
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,399
他有一些个人问题。
He'd been having some personal issues.

122
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,239
我建议他休一段时间的回家假。一些时间来总结一下。
I'd recommended a period of home leave. Some time to take stock.

123
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,640
什么样的问题？
What kind of issues?

124
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,160
边缘性抑郁症。焦虑症发作。
Borderline depression. Anxiety attacks.

125
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,119
工作的压力。这导致了一些错误的决策。
The stress of the job. It had led to some poor decision making.

126
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,720
你能详细说明一下吗？
Would you care to elaborate on that?

127
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,839
帕特里克有一个倾向，就是与他的病人过于投入。
Patrick had a tendency to get too involved with his patients.

128
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,080
你永远无法承担他们的问题。
You can never take on their problems.

129
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,519
那他的私人生活呢？我知道帕特里克是同性恋。
What about his private life? I know Patrick was gay.

130
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,519
他从未提到过他的伴侣。
He never mentioned a partner.

131
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,439
这些不允许他见的病人... ...
These patients that he wasn't allowed to see...

132
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,599
你认为他们中的任何一个都会被警察知道吗？
do you think any of them would've been known to the police?

133
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,799
我们通过咨询来帮助他们向前迈进。
We use counselling to help them move forward.

134
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,879
这将有助于我们推进调查
It would help us move this investigation forward

135
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,960
如果你能让我们看到这些病人的详细资料，将有助于我们推进调查。
if you let us see the details of the patients.

136
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,439
这将影响到我们在这里所做的一切。这是对信任的公然破坏。
That would compromise everything we do here. A blatant breach of trust.

137
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,559
他们的医疗记录将保持机密。
Their medical records would remain confidential.

138
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,199
我没有义务分享这些信息。
I'm under no obligation to share that information.

139
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
你和我一样清楚这一点。
And you know that as well as I do.

140
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,799
Patrick Elliot，36岁。
Patrick Elliot, 36.

141
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,119
尸体今早在Framley庄园被发现。
Body was discovered this morning on the Framley Estate.

142
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,159
他从十楼的阳台上摔下来，这是致命的。
He had a fatal fall from the tenth-floor balcony.

143
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,319
他有压力和抑郁症的困扰。
He was suffering from stress and depression.

144
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,719
所以我们不能排除自杀的可能？该公寓被洗劫一空。
So we can't rule out a suicide? The flat had been ransacked.

145
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,599
阳台上有打斗的痕迹。
There were signs of a struggle on the balcony.

146
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,319
他昨天的行动，我们是否确定了时间线？
And his movements yesterday, have we established a timeline?

147
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,599
我们知道他在下午5点左右去了杜松子诊所。
We know he went to The Juniper Practice at around 5pm.

148
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,799
他与那里的医务主任发生了冲突。
He had a run-in with the medical director there,

149
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,959
她拒绝让他回去工作。
when she refused to allow him to return to work.

150
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,999
萨曼莎-拉尔森医生。她是个坚强的人。
Dr Samantha Larsson. Bit of a tough cookie.

151
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,239
他毫不犹豫地回绝了我们所有的问题。
Had no problem stonewalling all of our questions.

152
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,799
我们从那个邻居戴安-布莱恩那里得到了一份声明。
We got a statement from that neighbour, Diane Blaine.

153
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,559
她说看到帕特里克在晚上7点左右到家。
She reported seeing Patrick arrive home around 7pm.

154
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,919
她确信他是一个人。据我们所知，他没有伴侣。
She was certain he was alone. No partner that we know of.

155
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,039
但我们已经确定帕特里克是同性恋。
But we have established that Patrick was gay.

156
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,039
这位邻居暗示他有定期的访客。
The neighbour implied he had regular visitors.

157
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,119
她没有详细说明，但大意很清楚。
She didn't elaborate, but the gist was clear.

158
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,039
联系他的服务提供商--电话记录，最近的通话记录。
Get on to his service provider - phone logs, recent calls.

159
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,519
看看他是否在使用任何约会应用程序。
See if he was using any dating apps.

160
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,799
死者的门最近被人用油漆涂抹过。
The deceased's door was recently defaced with paint.

161
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,039
根据看守人的说法。
According to the caretaker,

162
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,439
经常有反社会行为的报告。
there'd been regular reports of anti-social behaviour.

163
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,999
这个庄园确实有点名气。
That estate does have a bit of a rep.

164
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,599
让我们检查一下指挥和控制系统，达伦。
Let's check the command and control system, Darren.

165
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,959
最近是否有对该地址的出动。公寓内的闭路电视。
Any recent callouts to that address. CCTV from the flats,

166
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,559
那些门铃摄像头。让我们看看是否有什么线索。
those doorbell cameras. Let's see if that leads to anything.

167
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,319
如果没有，我们可以发出公开呼吁。
If not, we can issue a public appeal.

168
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,359
拉尔森医生还拒绝让我们
Dr Larsson also refused to allow us

169
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,039
拒绝让我们看到帕特里克-埃利奥特的病人的详细资料。
to see the details of Patrick Elliot's patients.

170
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,599
这让我们感到非常沮丧
Which was a great frustration to us

171
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,279
因为众所周知，该诊所为前罪犯提供服务。
because the practice is known to work with ex-offenders.

172
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,800
这可能值得研究，看看是否有名字出现。
It might be worth looking into, see if any names flag up.

173
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,159
好吧。我将申请法院命令。但让我们行使一些自由裁量权。
Fine. I'll apply for a court order. But let's exercise some discretion.

174
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,720
一个字？我的办公室。
A word? My office.

175
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,439
Michael Flannery的母亲。
Michael Flannery's mother.

176
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,399
听说你昨天参加了她的葬礼。
Heard you attended her funeral yesterday.

177
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,799
哦，我明白了，是的。不，我出现了。
Oh, I see, yes. No, I showed up.

178
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,479
公然和一个被定罪的杀人犯勾搭在一起。
Openly consorting with a convicted murderer.

179
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,519
我不会说这是勾搭，不。
I would not call it consorting, no.

180
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,039
这个顾问角色有一定的责任。
This consultancy role comes with certain responsibilities.

181
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,519
也许是这样，但人们必须搞清楚的是
That may be, but what people have got to get their head round

182
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,879
是我不再是一个工作的侦探了。
is that I am not a working detective any more,

183
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,039
我在自己的时间里做什么是我的事。
and what I do in my own time is my business.

184
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,439
如果它对这个警队有不好的影响，那就不是了。
Not if it reflects badly on this force, it isn't.

185
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,160
我们必须要小心。
We have to be careful.

186
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,359
好吧，对不起，我打断了公关活动。
Right, well, I'm sorry I interrupted the PR drive.

187
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,159
信不信由你，雷德利，我只是在为你着想。
Believe it or not, Ridley, I'm just looking out for you.

188
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,640
好吧。好吧，你的担心已经被注意到了。
OK. Well, your concern has been noted.

189
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,599
我听说伊芙-马布里对过失杀人罪认罪。
I hear Eve Marbury's pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

190
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,479
真的吗？
Really?

191
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,040
如此悲伤，整个事情，不是吗？
So sad, the whole thing, isn't it?

192
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,919
你知道，凯特之外，
You know, Kate aside,

193
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,639
你一直是一个糟糕的判断女人。
you've always been a poor judge of women.

194
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,479
哦。这对一个警察来说不是一个好的特征。
Oh. It's not a good trait in a copper.

195
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,919
没错。嗯，你知道，这也许能解释
Right. Well, you know, that'll maybe explain

196
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,519
我怎么会和你成为伴侣的。
how I ended up with you as a mate.

197
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,160
她笑着说，哦，哎哟！
SHE CHUCKLES Oh, ouch!

198
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,320
他叹气
HE SIGHS

199
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,920
Michael Flannery的母亲昨天下葬了。
Michael Flannery's mother was buried yesterday.

200
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,320
我和亚当-唐纳利的同事们发生了一点冲突。
I had a bit of a run-in with Adam Donnelly's associates.

201
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,520
他们在凯特和艾拉的坟墓上献了花。
They laid flowers on Kate and Ella's grave.

202
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,599
你认为那是某种威胁？
You think that's some kind of threat?

203
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,919
嗯，是我的证据把他打倒了，你知道。
Well, it was my evidence that sent him down, you know.

204
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,240
我估计他们知道我会出现在葬礼上。
I reckon they knew I'd show up at the funeral.

205
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,239
但现在你是个前警察，没有人保护你了。
But now you're an ex-copper, with no-one to watch your back.

206
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,000
是的，没错。不，他们只是在给我下套。
Yeah, right. No, they were just winding me up.

207
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,680
这很严重，亚历克斯。
This is serious, Alex.

208
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,799
我是说，你应该担心。
I mean, you should be worried.

209
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,959
我们应该担心。来吧。
We should be worried. Come on.

210
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,319
如果亚当-唐纳利和他的伙伴们想做什么，
If Adam Donnelly and his mates wanted to do something,

211
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,559
他们已经做了它现在。
they'd have done it by now.

212
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,239
好吧，我希望你是对的。
Well, I hope you're right.

213
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,600
因为我们两个人最不需要的就是更多的悲伤。
Because the last thing either of us need is any more grief.

214
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,480
爵士乐响起
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

215
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,399
你到底在做什么，来俱乐部？
What the hell are you doing, coming to the club?

216
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,759
他们已经为亚当-唐纳利的审判设定了日期。
They've set a date for Adam Donnelly's trial.

217
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,919
这就更说明了我们不应该说话。
All the more reason why we shouldn't be talking.

218
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,159
唐纳利并不傻。
Donnelly isn't stupid.

219
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,519
他将工作这一切了。我是你的消息来源。
He's going to work it all out. That I'm your source.

220
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,759
这可能是任何数量的人，好吗？
It could have been any number of people, all right?

221
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,479
我已经得到了数据库的访问。员工名册，PIN码。
I've got access to the database. Staff rosters, PIN codes.

222
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,319
我知道他是什么时候把这些货物带进来的。
I knew when he was bringing those consignments in.

223
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,359
听着，我告诉过你，我们的消息来源总是受到保护。
Look, I told you - our sources are always protected.

224
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
我已经向你保证了这一点，好吗？
I've given you my word on that, all right?

225
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,759
所以，只要保持你的头低。你只要保持距离就可以了。
So just keep your head down. You've just gotta keep your distance.

226
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,239
至少在我们把他打伤之前，好吗？所以，你去吧。
At least until we get him banged up, all right? So off you go.

227
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,039
去吧，回家吧。
Go on, get home.

228
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,119
还有，迈克尔。
And, Michael.

229
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,240
别再出现在这里了。
Don't ever show up here again.

230
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,319
所以，我们已经编好了所有的受伤程度
So, we've catalogued the full extent of the injuries

231
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,039
摔伤的程度。
sustained in the fall.

232
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,919
多处骨折，特别是胸椎和腰椎。
Multiple fractures, notably thoracic and lumbar spine.

233
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,639
广泛的腹部创伤。
Extensive abdominal trauma.

234
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,879
还有一些内脏器官的损伤。
And some visceral damage to the internal organs.

235
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,319
左边三角肌的组织也有撕裂。
There was also a tear to the tissue of the left deltoid.

236
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,519
这为他被推倒的理论增加了砝码。
Which adds weight to the theory he was pushed.

237
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,319
在他倒下之前，他一直坚持着自己的生命。
Hung on for dear life before he fell.

238
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,279
手掌印？证实与死者吻合。
The palm print? Confirmed as a match with the deceased.

239
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,039
死后的液体和组织中含有酒精。
Alcohol in the postmortem fluids and tissues.

240
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,119
还有羟考酮的痕迹。
Also traces of oxycodone,

241
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,439
一种处方类鸦片。
a prescription opiate.

242
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,119
毒品和酒的结合会让他变得昏昏沉沉。
And a combination of drugs and booze would have made him woozy.

243
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,279
你知道，可能会影响他的平衡。
You know, might have affected his balance.

244
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,199
鞋底有什么发现吗？第一套是属于死者的。
Any joy with the shoe treads? The first set belonged to the deceased,

245
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,199
他跌倒时穿的运动鞋。
the trainers he was wearing when he fell.

246
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,119
另一套是相当独特的。
The other set were quite distinctive.

247
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,919
我想说的是更正式的东西。
I'd say something more formal.

248
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,679
厨房里的玻璃杯已经被擦拭干净了。
Glass tumbler in the kitchen had been wiped clean.

249
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,599
所以有可能帕特里克认识凶手？
So chances are, Patrick knew his killer?

250
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,559
我确实找到了几个匹配的指纹
I did find a couple of matching prints

251
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,399
还没有找到
that haven't been accounted for.

252
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,599
你把它们与数据库进行了比对吗？没有，我怕。
Did you match them against the database? No joy, I'm afraid.

253
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,839
这就排除了我们的犯罪者有任何前科。
That rules out our offender as having any previous.

254
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,239
我们需要得到一份帕特里克-埃利奥特的病人名单。
We need to get a list of Patrick Elliot's patients.

255
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,239
必须让古德温去做这件事。是的，你和他的那次谈话。
Must get Goodwin going on that. Yeah, that chat you had with him.

256
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,959
有什么我应该知道的吗？没有。
Was it anything I should know about? No.

257
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,719
只是他想让我保持信息畅通。
Just him trying to keep me on message.

258
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,639
短信提示
TEXT ALERT

259
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,239
"开花"？
"Blossom"?!

260
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,599
一切都好吗？
Everything all right?

261
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,519
哦，盖瑞怀孕了。哦，祝贺你！
Oh, Geri's pregnant. Oh, congratulations!

262
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,239
谢谢。不过，她想出了一些很糟糕的名字。
Thanks. She's coming up with some god-awful names, though.

263
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,559
Bluebell, Coral, Meadow。
Bluebell, Coral, Meadow.

264
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,559
那就是小女儿了，是吗？是的。
Little girl, then, is it? Yeah.

265
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,879
又有一剂雌性激素要让杰克去应付了。
Another dose of oestrogen for Jack to contend with.

266
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,839
可怜的老杰克。不过我们能不能暂时保密？
Poor old Jack. Can we keep it between us for now, though?

267
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,799
哦，是的，当然可以。谢谢。
Oh, yeah, of course. Thanks.

268
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,679
老板？是的。
Boss? Yes.

269
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,279
我跟进了那些反社会行为事件
I followed up on those anti-social behaviour incidents

270
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,959
在Framley小区。嗯？
on the Framley Estate. Mm?

271
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,559
邻居警察被帕特里克-埃利奥特叫出去了
Neighbourhood police were called out

272
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,759
在三个不同的场合被Patrick Elliot叫了出来。
on three separate occasions by Patrick Elliot.

273
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,039
他声称他是庄园里一帮女孩的仇视同性恋的虐待受害者。
He claimed he'd been a victim of homophobic abuse

274
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,639
被庄园里的一帮女孩虐待。
by a gang of girls on the estate.

275
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,359
他还报告了6个月前的一次非法入侵。
He also reported a break-in six months ago.

276
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,999
一些个人物品被盗--一块手表和一个平板电脑
Some personal items were stolen - a watch and a tablet

277
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,479
和一些个人文件。我们得到了任何名字吗？
and some personal documents. Did we get any names?

278
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,319
头目是罗谢尔-布莱恩，帕特里克的邻居。
The ringleader's Rochelle Blaine, Patrick's neighbour.

279
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,039
我们已经得到了弗兰姆利庄园看守人的声明。
We've got a statement from the caretaker on the Framley Estate.

280
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,759
显然你和你的朋友
And apparently you and your friends

281
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,959
是一个经常性的麻烦源。
are a regular source of trouble.

282
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,879
我们从你们那里得到的只是悲痛。
All we ever get from your lot is grief.

283
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,199
帕特里克-埃利奥特在一些投诉中提到了你。
You were named by Patrick Elliot in a number of complaints

284
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,919
他向警方提出了一些投诉。
he made to the police.

285
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,639
与酒精有关的滋扰、刑事损害和仇视同性恋的虐待。
Alcohol-related nuisance, criminal damage and homophobic abuse.

286
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,599
我们时不时地给他说几句。有点戏谑，仅此而已。
We gave him a bit of lip, now and then. Bit of banter, that's all.

287
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,559
如今，这就是所谓的仇恨犯罪，罗谢尔。
These days that's what's known as a hate crime, Rochelle.

288
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,679
这为你赢得了犯罪行为令。
Which earned you a Criminal Behaviour Order.

289
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,959
像他这样的人。
People like him,

290
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,760
他这种人...
his sort...

291
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,159
有时他们就是在自找麻烦。
Sometimes they're just asking for it.

292
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,599
那会是什么样的人呢，罗谢尔？这是不对的。
And what sort might that be, Rochelle? It just wasn't right.

293
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,400
这就是她所说的。
That's all she's saying.

294
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,079
那六个月前的盗窃案呢？
What about this burglary, six months ago?

295
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,879
罗谢尔和那件事没有关系。
Rochelle had nothing to do with that.

296
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,799
我从你给Lakhan警官的陈述中看到，
I see from the statement that you gave DS Lakhan,

297
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,359
你没有提到
you failed to mention

298
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,959
你的女儿和死者有过节。
that your daughter and the deceased had history.

299
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,399
这让我觉得，你是在为她打掩护。
Which makes me think that you're trying to cover for her.

300
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,279
我不知道她已经出去了。直到我下班回到家才知道。
I didn't know that she'd been out. Not until I got back home from work.

301
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,919
所以你是在确认，为了记录，
So you're confirming, for the record,

302
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,439
你的女儿周一晚上不在家？
that your daughter wasn't home on Monday night?

303
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,279
有时很难对她进行监控。她让我疲于奔命。
It's hard to keep tabs on her sometimes. She runs me ragged.

304
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,039
是的，好吧，我想我可以帮助你。
Yes, well, I think I can help you with that.

305
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,119
这是一个闭路电视摄像头的屏幕截图。
Here's a screen grab from a CCTV camera,

306
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,159
显示罗谢尔和她的伙伴们在拘留所外。
showing Rochelle outside the lock-ups with her mates.

307
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,919
我们只是在聊天，仅此而已。
We were talking, that's all.

308
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,279
你对帕特里克-艾略特进行辱骂。
You were giving Patrick Elliot verbal abuse.

309
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,839
那也只是一点玩笑话吗？
Was that just a bit of banter, as well?

310
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,799
你的伙伴们也证实你在喝酒。
Your mates also confirmed you were drinking.

311
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,639
这两点都违反了你的犯罪行为令的条款。
Both of which breach the terms of your Criminal Behaviour Order.

312
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,079
我认为你和你的朋友跟着帕特里克-埃利奥特
I think you and your friends followed Patrick Elliot

313
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,959
回到了他的公寓，然后继续你们的工作。
back to his flat and just continued where you left off.

314
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,879
我们从未接近过他的公寓。
We never went anywhere near his flat.

315
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,919
问我的姑娘们。她们会告诉你。
Ask my girls. They'll tell you.

316
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,799
她们对那晚的所有描述似乎都是一致的。
All their accounts of that evening seem to tally.

317
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,839
在拘留所外与死者发生了争吵。
An altercation with the deceased outside the lock-ups.

318
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,759
虽然有一个女孩确实打破了僵局。
Though one girl did break ranks.

319
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,919
她说罗谢尔在8点半左右离开了这群人。
She said that Rochelle left the group around 8:30.

320
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,239
然后去见她的男朋友，贾里德-博克斯。
And went off to see her boyfriend, Jared Boakes.

321
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,599
他因与帕特里克-埃利奥特公寓的那起入室盗窃案有关而被询问。
And he was questioned in connection to that burglary

322
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,480
在帕特里克-埃利奥特的公寓里。
at Patrick Elliot's flat.

323
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,679
别这样。我什么都没做。
Come on. I've not done nothing.

324
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,600
小心你的头。注意你的头，Jared。
Watch your head. Mind your head, Jared.

325
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,919
我们收到了你一个朋友的证词
We've got a statement from one of your mates.

326
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,839
她说你在Patrick被杀的那天晚上和Jared Boakes见面了
She claims that you met up with Jared Boakes on the evening

327
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,279
她说你在Patrick被杀的那晚和Jared Boakes见面 那如果是我呢?
that Patrick was murdered. So, what if I did?

328
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,039
那就意味着你一直在对我们撒谎 Rochelle
Well, that would mean that you've been lying to us, Rochelle.

329
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,200
这也让人怀疑你对那晚的描述。
And it calls into question your account of that night.

330
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,359
我们在他的房间里呆了一段时间。 在庄园的车库里。
We spent some time at his lock-up. the garages on the estate.

331
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,640
你们当时在做什么？
What were you doing?

332
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,799
你想让我给你画一张画吗？
Do you want me to draw you a picture?

333
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,640
哦，罗谢尔！
Oh, Rochelle!

334
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,159
有人告诉你不要和Jared交往。
You were told not to associate with Jared.

335
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,199
这是你的CBO的一个条件。你以为我为什么不告诉你?
It was a condition of your CBO. Why do you think I didn't tell you?

336
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,799
这间禁闭室里有什么?
This lock-up, what's in it?

337
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,680
Jared把各种东西都放在里面。
Jared keeps all kinds of stuff in there.

338
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,720
让我们把它们装进袋子里并贴上标签
Let's get them bagged and tagged.

339
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,239
我们正在审问Rochelle Blaine
We're questioning Rochelle Blaine

340
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,279
与Patrick Elliot的谋杀案有关
in connection to Patrick Elliot's murder.

341
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,839
由于周一晚上你和她在一起 你是唯一能证明她在哪里的人
And as you were with her on Monday night, you're the one person

342
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,640
你是唯一能证明她在晚上8点半之后的行踪的人。
who can vouch for her whereabouts after 8:30pm.

343
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,799
好吧，我和她在一起。大约一个小时，最多。
OK, I was with her. About an hour, tops.

344
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,759
这直接违反了
Which directly contravenes the conditions

345
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,439
犯罪行为令的条件。
of the Criminal Behaviour Order.

346
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,799
反过来，这可能会使你被判处监禁。
Which, in turn, could earn you a custodial sentence.

347
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,239
现在，我们知道，罗谢尔
Now, we know that Rochelle

348
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,199
和帕特里克-艾略特在当晚早些时候发生了争吵。
and Patrick Elliot had an altercation earlier on that evening.

349
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,119
是的。她像往常一样对帕特里克口出狂言。
Yeah. She was mouthing off about Patrick as usual.

350
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,960
我告诉她，我不需要这种委屈。
I told her I didn't need the aggravation.

351
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,719
然后，可悲的是，几小时后，他被谋杀了。
And then, sadly, a few hours later he was murdered.

352
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,279
这与我毫无关系。
Which had nothing to do with me.

353
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,599
帕特里克-艾略特六个月前被盗。
Patrick Elliot was burgled six months ago.

354
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,839
你被当做嫌疑人审问。
You were questioned as a person of interest.

355
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,599
这和罗谢尔有什么关系？闯入帕特里克的公寓。
What's this got to do with Rochelle? The break-in at Patrick's flat.

356
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,960
一块手表是被报失的物品之一。
A wristwatch was one of the items that was reported stolen.

357
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,320
就是我们在你的房间里发现的那块表。
The same watch that we found hidden in your lock-up.

358
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,999
以前从未见过。真的吗？
Never seen it before. Really?

359
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,920
那就奇怪了... ... 因为上面都是你的指纹。
That's strange... cos your fingerprints are all over it.

360
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,359
星期一，我从未接近过那个地方。你认为我有那么傻吗？
Monday, I never went near the place. D'you think I'd be that stupid?

361
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,079
好吧，我想罗谢尔会很有说服力。
Well, I imagine Rochelle could be very persuasive.

362
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,759
充满了怨恨。怀有怨恨。不能见她的朋友。
Full of resentment. Bearing a grudge. Couldn't see her friends.

363
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,999
不能见她的伙伴们。不能见她的男朋友。
Couldn't see her mates. Couldn't see her boyfriend.

364
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,639
而这一切都是因为帕特里克-艾略特和他的抱怨。
And all because of Patrick Elliot and the complaint that he made.

365
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,920
就像他能看到它一样。
It was like he could see it.

366
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,560
她已经崩溃了。
That she was broken.

367
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,039
Chelle无法忍受这一点。
Chelle couldn't bear that.

368
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,319
所以她想她会去扳平比分。
So she thought she'd go and even the score.

369
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,399
而你是有承诺的，所以你就顺水推舟了。
And you were on a promise, so you just went along for the ride.

370
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,839
我们勾搭上了。我们亲热。
We hooked up. We made out.

371
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,240
我们回家了。
We went home.

372
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,119
Jared Boakes的指纹与公寓里的指纹不一致。
Jared Boakes' prints didn't match the one's at the flat.

373
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,759
我们在阳台上没有找到符合脚印的鞋子。
We didn't find any shoes that fit the tread on the balcony.

374
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,559
我们可以指控他盗窃手机。
We can charge him with the theft of the mobile phones.

375
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,319
让我们与正在调查入室盗窃的小组联系。
Let's liaise with the team who are investigating the burglary.

376
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,919
但我们知道那块手表是六个月前被偷的。
But we know that watch was stolen six months ago.

377
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,280
我们没有证据表明他与帕特里克的谋杀案有关。
We've got nothing to connect him to Patrick's murder.

378
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,039
Patrick Elliot的病人。法庭命令有进展吗?
Patrick Elliot's patients. Any joy with that court order?

379
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,919
医疗记录刚刚送来 在拉森医生的胁迫下交出来的
Medical records just came in. Handed over under duress by Dr Larsson.

380
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,199
我会好好看看这些资料的。机密信息，雷德利。
I'll have a good look through them. Confidential information, Ridley.

381
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,360
让我们确保它保持这种状态。
Let's make sure it stays that way.

382
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,959
听着，卡罗尔，我一直在寻找通过
Listen, Carol, I've been looking through

383
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,079
Patrick Elliot的病人档案
Patrick Elliot's patients' files.

384
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,919
让我眼前一亮的名字是卡尔-弗兰纳里。
The name that jumps out at me is Cal Flannery.

385
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,799
迈克尔-弗兰纳里的弟弟。
Michael Flannery's younger brother.

386
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,279
在过去的18个月里，他一直在接受咨询。
He's been in counselling for the last 18 months.

387
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,119
悲痛的创伤，愤怒的管理。
Grief trauma, anger management.

388
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,559
他最后一次预约是在两周前。
His last appointment was just over two weeks ago.

389
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,119
这就说得通了，帕特里克被解雇的时候。
Well, that makes sense, with when Patrick was furloughed.

390
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,399
是的，没错。然而，仅在上周就有五个电话打到帕特里克的手机上。
Yeah, exactly. However, there's been five calls to Patrick's phone

391
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,839
就在上周
in the last week alone.

392
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,479
来电者的身份已经被追踪到斯坦利角的一个地址。
And the caller's ID has been traced to an address in Stanley Corner.

393
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,639
24号。
Number 24.

394
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,679
那是Gloria Flannery的房子。好吗？
That's Gloria Flannery's house. OK?

395
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,519
所以他是一个被定罪的杀人犯的兄弟。
So he's the brother of a convicted murderer.

396
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,639
是的，但这并不意味着他犯了什么罪。
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that he's guilty of anything.

397
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,360
是的，我知道。我知道。我们还是要坚持到底，对吗？
Yeah, I know. I know. We still have to follow this through, right?

398
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,239
你真的认为他会和你谈吗？
Do you really think he'll talk to you?

399
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,559
他知道我还和迈克尔保持着联系。所以...
He knows I've still been in touch with Michael. So...

400
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,600
有一点共同点，不是吗？
there's a wee bit of common ground there somewhere, isn't there?

401
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,839
Cal Flannery? 是的，谁在问？
Cal Flannery? Yeah, who's asking?

402
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,240
法曼警官。科佩尔顿警察。
DI Farman. Copelton Police.

403
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,920
他在这里做什么?
What's he doing here?

404
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,159
他没有权利来这里，他。
He's got no right coming round here, him.

405
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,959
我们只是想问你几个问题。
We just want to ask you some questions.

406
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,680
也许我们最好在里面问。
Might be best if we do it inside.

407
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,879
这一切是怎么回事？
What's all this about?

408
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,559
我们知道，你是帕特里克-埃利奥特的病人之一？
We understand that you were one of Patrick Elliot's patients?

409
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,279
是的，社会服务部门让我与该中心取得联系。
Yeah, the social services put me in touch with the centre.

410
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,039
他们经常检查我和我妈妈的情况。
They used to check up on me and my mum.

411
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,639
哦，那么你见他有一段时间了，是吗？
Oh, so you'd been seeing him for some time, then?

412
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,359
我有一些问题需要解决。
I had a few issues that needed addressing.

413
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,079
听着，我看了你的进度报告。
Listen, I looked at your progress report,

414
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,879
那是很有趣的阅读。根据帕特里克的说法，
that made interesting reading. According to Patrick,

415
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,639
你的健康状况受到了质疑，是吗？
your well-being was called into question, is that right?

416
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,279
你在说什么？你不应该看这个。
What're you talking about? You shouldn't be looking at that.

417
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,479
那是私人的东西。
That's private stuff.

418
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,840
你一定知道他被停职了？
You must have known that he had been suspended?

419
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,119
是的。诊所联系过了。
Yeah. The practice got in touch.

420
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,879
那一定很艰难。不再需要他了。
That must've been tough. Didn't need him any more.

421
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,919
我认为这不是真的，是吗，卡尔？
I don't think that's really true, is it, Cal?

422
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,679
从帕特里克-艾略特的电话记录来看
It appears from Patrick Elliot's phone records

423
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,520
你们一直保持着联系。
that you had stayed in touch.

424
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,039
是的。可能偶尔会给他打电话。
Yeah. Might have rang him now and again.

425
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,159
他总是说，如果我需要谈话，那就可以。
He always said it was fine if I needed to talk.

426
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,399
去过他家吗？
Ever been round his house?

427
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,559
我甚至不知道他住在哪里。真的吗？
I didn't even know where he lived. Really?

428
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,040
星期一晚上你在哪里，卡尔？
Where were you on Monday evening, Cal?

429
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,599
我妈妈的葬礼。
My mum's wake.

430
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,719
问他。他会告诉你的。
Ask him. He'll tell you.

431
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
是的，他在那里，在葬礼上。你不在吗？
Yeah, he was there, at the funeral. Weren't you?

432
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,359
这个守夜仪式，是在当地举行的吗？
This wake, was it local?

433
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,759
Kirkhall Rise的社交俱乐部。
Social club on Kirkhall Rise.

434
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,119
我一定是最后一个离开的。
I must've been the last to leave.

435
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,199
那是帕特里克-艾略特被谋杀的那个晚上。
That was the evening Patrick Elliot was murdered.

436
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,519
这跟我有什么关系？
What's that got to do with me?

437
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,799
嗯，你看，这些电话使你成为我们感兴趣的人。
Well, you see, these phone calls make you a person of interest to us.

438
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,719
我们只是在问你一些问题，卡尔。
We're just asking you some questions, Cal.

439
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,399
一些例行调查。
Some routine enquiries.

440
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,479
我还在为我的母亲感到悲伤。
I'm still grieving me mum.

441
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,199
而且... ... 你们两个来这里问问题
And... and you two coming round here asking questions

442
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,160
我无法回答的问题，你想让我说什么？
that I can't answer, what do you want me to say?

443
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,159
我已经把她所有的衣服都装进袋子里了。
I've bagged up all of her clothes there.

444
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,199
准备带到慈善商店去。但它已经在那里放了好几天了。
Ready to take to the charity shop. But it's been sitting there days.

445
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,560
是啊。一定很艰难，你知道。
Yeah. Must be tough, you know.

446
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,879
就你一个人。大家都走了。没有人离开。
On your own. Everybody gone. Nobody left.

447
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,519
你知道他们威胁她了吗？
Do you know that they threatened her?

448
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,879
亚当-唐纳利的几个人，在他们把迈克尔送下去之后。
Couple of Adam Donnelly's lot, after they sent Michael down.

449
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,639
他们说她的儿子是借来的时间。你知道吗？
They said her son was on borrowed time. Do you know that?

450
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,920
你应该打电话给警察。这样做有什么好处？
You should have called the police. What good would that have done?!

451
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,600
我看到了你对迈克尔的所作所为。
I saw what you did to Michael.

452
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,079
你去参加了他母亲的葬礼？
You went to his mother's funeral?

453
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,559
这很复杂。是啊，你总是这样，雷德利。
It's complicated. Yeah, it always is with you, Ridley.

454
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,119
他在说谎，从他的牙齿。
He's lying through his teeth.

455
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,119
你没有权利提起他的医疗记录。
You had no right to bring up his medical records.

456
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,239
我做得很好。我们从他身上得到了启发。
It was a good job I did. We got a rise out of him.

457
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,079
我越早到这个社交俱乐部去，
The sooner I get down to this social club,

458
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,599
我就能越早查出他的不在场证明。
the sooner I can check out his alibi.

459
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,039
是的，我会穿上制服去的。但你要离开这里了。
Yes, I will get a uniform on to it. But you are stepping away from this.

460
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,279
好吧。
Fine.

461
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,960
好吧，好吧。这是你的案子。
Fine. It's your case.

462
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,399
我把Rochelle交给你照顾
I'm releasing Rochelle into your care

463
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,839
作为一个被调查的人
as a person under investigation.

464
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,079
她不会面临任何指控 Jared Boakes也不会。
She won't be facing any charges, and neither will Jared Boakes.

465
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,239
但他们都还在被怀疑之中。
But they are both still under suspicion.

466
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,600
罗谢尔？
Rochelle?

467
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,520
布莱恩夫人，你明白我在对你说什么吗？
Mrs Blaine, do you understand what I'm saying to you?

468
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,439
我确实给某人打过钟，那晚。
I did clock someone, that night.

469
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,119
什么，这只是在你女儿被牵连后才想起来的？
What, and this has only just come to mind

470
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,759
因为你女儿被牵连进来了？
since your daughter's been implicated?

471
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,079
他当时在入口处。没有靠近公寓的地方。
He was by the entrance bit. Nowhere near the flat.

472
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,599
你能描述一下他吗？
Can you describe him?

473
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,239
20岁左右。黑头发。
Late 20s. Dark hair.

474
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,799
你知道，看起来很有吸引力。
You know, attractive looking.

475
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,439
你以前见过他吗？
Had you seen him before?

476
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,199
不是本地人。
Wasn't local.

477
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,319
我认识庄园里的所有小伙子。
I know all the lads on the estate.

478
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,199
聪明的西装。黑领带。
Smart suit. Black tie.

479
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,120
这就是他脱颖而出的原因。
That's the reason he stood out.

480
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,079
我们有另一条潜在的线索。
We have another potential lead.

481
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,199
Michael Flannery的哥哥是Patrick的病人之一。
Michael Flannery's brother was one of Patrick's patients.

482
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,639
什么？没有记录。没有前科。
What? No record. No previous.

483
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,359
我们还在调查他在案发当晚的不在场证明。
We are still checking out his alibi on the evening of the murder.

484
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,800
你已经和他谈过了? Ridley坚持要我们问一些问题。
You've spoken to him already? Ridley insisted we ask some questions.

485
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,679
我想这是基于一些相关的情报吧?
I'm assuming this is based on some pertinent intel?

486
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,079
卡尔-弗兰纳里和帕特里克还保持着联系。
Cal Flannery and Patrick were still in touch.

487
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,999
他的医疗记录显示他的行为不稳定。
His medical notes reported erratic behaviour.

488
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,359
我需要的不仅仅是这些，卡罗尔。
I'll need more than that, Carol.

489
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,439
他也符合黛安-布莱恩刚刚给我的描述。
He also fits the description Diane Blaine just gave me.

490
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,200
她说她在案发当晚看到一个年轻男子。
A young male that she claims she saw on the evening of the murder.

491
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,239
好的。让我们把他带回来进行排查。
Right. Let's bring him back in for a line-up.

492
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,479
看看她能不能确认身份。
See if she can make an ID.

493
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,919
长官 Ridley之前和Cal Flannery的行为
Sir, Ridley's behaviour earlier with Cal Flannery,

494
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,279
令人担忧。
it was concerning.

495
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,599
他似乎想解决一些问题。我不得不警告他。
He seems to want to settle some scores. I had to warn him off.

496
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,799
我以前从未见过这种情况，但这让我很担心。
I've never seen it before, but it worries me.

497
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,919
你在负责这个案子，卡罗尔。我知道。
You're running this case, Carol. I know.

498
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,719
但这不是我想做的决定。
But it's not a call I wanna make.

499
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,000
那就让我替你做吧。先生。
Then let me make it for you. Sir.

500
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,999
雷德利？是吗？
Ridley?! Yeah?

501
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,639
很高兴我在你离开前抓住了你。
Glad I caught you before you left.

502
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,999
是的 我明天要在唐纳利的审判中提供证据
Yeah. I'm giving evidence in Donnelly's trial tomorrow.

503
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,239
有点轻松的阅读。CPS给我们扔了一个曲线球。
Bit of light reading. The CPS have thrown us a curveball.

504
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,559
他们担心我们的消息来源从未登记过。
They have concerns that our source was never registered.

505
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,359
担心我们的消息来源从未登记过？
Concerns our source was never registered?

506
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,199
弗兰纳里不会同意的。这一定是在书本之外。
Flannery would never have agreed to it. It's got to be off the books.

507
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,439
辩方会问你是如何得到这些证据的。
The defence will ask how you got hold of the evidence.

508
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,079
你得给他们一个名字，雷德利。哦，看在上帝的份上！
You'll have to give them a name, Ridley. Oh, for Christ's sake!

509
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,039
我向他保证过。
I gave him my word.

510
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,039
未经正当程序招募线人。
Recruiting an informant without due process.

511
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,679
没有授权，没有风险评估。
No authorisation, no risk assessment.

512
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,199
你违反了书中的所有规则。
You broke every rule in the book.

513
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,279
是的。你在当时没有问题！
Yeah. You'd no problem with it at the time!

514
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,399
没有问题采取的赞誉，当我们做了所有这些逮捕。
No problem taking the plaudits when we made all those arrests.

515
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,839
唯一重要的是让唐纳利下课。
The only thing that matters is getting Donnelly sent down.

516
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,800
我们已经很努力了，不能把这一切都抛弃了。
We've worked too hard to throw it all away.

517
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,799
没有名字，你说。
No names, you said.

518
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,879
你看。我们需要你的证据，把他送下来。
Look. We needed your evidence to send him down.

519
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,559
没有其他选择。
There was no other choice.

520
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,439
你觉得在这之后我还会安全吗?
D'you think I'm ever gonna be safe after this?

521
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,999
我们要把Adam Donnelly关很久。
We are going to put Adam Donnelly away for a long time.

522
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,439
让他不能碰你。他给我打电话了。
Somewhere he can't touch you. He called me.

523
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,799
从他的牢房里。
From his prison cell.

524
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,279
说他要把我剁了。我是个死人，雷德利。
Said he were going to chop me up. I'm a dead man, Ridley.

525
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,999
听着，我会和DCI谈谈。
Look, I will talk to the DCI.

526
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,959
我们会给你一个安全屋，直到这一切平静下来。一个安全屋？
We'll give you a safe house, till this all calms down. A safe house?

527
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,880
我需要证人保护。在离阿勒顿很远的地方。
I need witness protection. Somewhere a long way from Allerton.

528
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,959
这很复杂。听着，你从来都不是一个正式的线人。
It's complicated. Look, you were never an official informant.

529
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,199
那你... 你打算就这样把我的手洗掉？
So what, you... you're gonna just wash your hands of me?

530
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,919
不，不，我要解决这个问题。我向你保证我会解决这个问题。
No. No. I'm gonna fix it. I promise you I will fix it.

531
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,599
我已经听够了你的承诺。
I've heard enough of your promises.

532
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,039
似乎它们并不重要。
Seems like they don't count for much.

533
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,159
迈克尔...
Michael...

534
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,640
迈克尔！
Michael!

535
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,519
真的不需要法院的命令。
There was really no need for a court order.

536
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,079
嗯，你知道。
Well, you know.

537
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,599
警方认为你妨碍了谋杀案的调查。
The police felt that you were obstructing a murder enquiry.

538
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,959
所以我认为完全有必要。
So I think there was every need.

539
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,719
我是为我的病人着想。
I was looking out for my patients.

540
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,399
我想和你谈谈其中的一个病人。卡尔-弗兰纳里。
One of those patients I'd like to talk to you about. Cal Flannery.

541
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,319
我从不讨论个别案件。缺席的父亲。
I never discuss individual cases. Absent father.

542
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,360
弟弟在监狱里。两天前埋葬了他的母亲。
Brother in prison. Buried his mother two days ago.

543
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,440
好吧，在这里。
OK, in here.

544
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,279
他从来没有真正有任何人在他身边。
He's never really ever had anyone there for him.

545
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,199
是啊，帕特里克-埃利奥特曾在他身边。
Yeah, well, Patrick Elliot was there for him.

546
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,879
直到你做了那个干预。这都是有记录的。
Until you made that intervention. It's all on record.

547
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,399
卡尔是帕特里克过于亲近的那些病人中的一个吗？
Was Cal one of those patients that Patrick got too close to?

548
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,439
卡尔对帕特里克过于依恋。
Cal had grown too attached to Patrick.

549
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,199
他们的治疗变得过于紧张。不太合适。
Their sessions had become too intense. Inappropriate.

550
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,999
你在说什么？他们的关系是性关系？
What are you saying? That, er, the relationship was sexual?

551
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,599
这是帕特里克永远不会越过的界限。
That's a line Patrick would never have crossed.

552
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,079
好吧，我们知道他们保持着联系。
Well, we know that they kept in touch,

553
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,720
在帕特里克被停职的两个星期里。
the two weeks of Patrick's suspension.

554
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,439
你真的是在暗示卡尔可能已经杀了他吗？
Are you seriously suggesting that Cal might have killed him?

555
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,799
我只是说，以你的专业意见，
I'm just saying, in your professional opinion,

556
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,159
鉴于这种情况，
given the circumstances,

557
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,480
你会说卡尔有能力谋杀吗？
would you say that Cal was capable of murder?

558
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,480
这是一个警方需要回答的问题。
That's a question the police need to answer.

559
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,280
如果你不介意的话，我得去工作了。
If you'll excuse me, I need to get to work.

560
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,879
帕特里克-艾略特与卡尔-弗兰纳里的关系。
Patrick Elliot's relationship with Cal Flannery.

561
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,279
拉森博士说这是不恰当的
Dr Larsson called it inappropriate.

562
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,159
那你到底是怎么发现的？
And how exactly did you find that out?

563
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,399
我今天早上去看了她
Well, I went to see her this morning.

564
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,519
在我警告你不要插手此事之后？
After I warned you to step away from this?

565
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,720
我只是在追踪一条线索，仅此而已
Just following up a lead, that's all.

566
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,959
雷德利...
Ridley...

567
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,240
一个字，请。
a word, please.

568
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,039
是的 听着 如果这只是一帮住宅区里的孩子
Yeah, look, if it was just a bunch of kids on a housing estate,

569
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,119
那就会有更多的东西把他们和犯罪联系起来。
there'd be a lot more to connect them to the crime,

570
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,239
他们会偷走钱包和电话。
they'd have stolen the wallet, the phone.

571
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,560
好吧。卡罗尔告诉我你去见了卡尔-弗兰纳里。
OK. Carol tells me you went to see Cal Flannery.

572
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,719
哦，对。
Oh, right.

573
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,839
是的，我想她认为我将会受到影响。
Yeah, I think she thought I was gonna be compromised.

574
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,759
她的担心是对的。迈克尔-弗兰纳里的弟弟！
She was right to be concerned. Michael Flannery's brother!

575
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,439
是的 但是如果Cal Flannery
Yes, but what if Cal Flannery

576
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,160
和帕特里克-艾略特的关系不仅仅是职业关系呢?
and Patrick Elliot's relationship was more than just professional?

577
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,159
那么，什么，你说这是一个激情犯罪？
So, what, you're saying that this is a crime of passion?

578
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,479
嗯，这绝对是一个调查的方向。我肯定... ...
Well, it's definitely a line of enquiry. I definitely...

579
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,399
敲门 抱歉打扰了，先生。
KNOCK AT DOOR Sorry to intrude, sir.

580
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,840
黛安-布兰刚来参加VIPER的排查。
Diane Blaine's just arrived for the VIPER line-up.

581
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,840
不，不...
No.

582
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,040
不，不...
No... Wait.

583
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,800
七号。
Number seven.

584
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,600
绝对是他
It's definitely him.

585
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,199
拉森博士
Dr Larsson.

586
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,879
我接到了你们值班律师的电话
I got a phone call from your duty solicitor.

587
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,759
她告诉我你已经逮捕了卡尔-弗兰纳里。
She told me you'd arrested Cal Flannery.

588
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,119
是的。我们正准备就帕特里克的谋杀案对他进行审讯。
Yes. We're just about to question him in relation to Patrick's murder.

589
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,479
卡尔被诊断为脆弱的成年人。
Cal's been diagnosed as a vulnerable adult.

590
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,719
哦，我们逮捕他的时候他没有提到这一点。
Oh, he failed to mention that when we arrested him.

591
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,239
这让人怀疑他是否有能力参与
Which casts doubt on his ability to participate

592
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,839
这让人怀疑他是否有能力有效地参与到这个调查的相关程序中。
effectively in procedures related to this investigation.

593
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,879
是的，我熟悉PACE的实践准则。
Yes, I am familiar with PACE codes of practice.

594
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,799
我已经带来了我们自己的一名律师。
I've brought along one of our own solicitors.

595
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,359
他将接替卡尔的简报。
He'll be taking over as Cal's brief.

596
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,559
他需要进行适当的精神评估
He'll need a proper psychiatric assessment

597
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,760
以确定他是否适合接受审讯。
to determine his suitability for questioning.

598
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,359
她是在拖延时间。好吧，如果你没有激怒她，也许是这样。
She's playing for time. Well, maybe if you hadn't riled her.

599
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,439
如果我们按兵不动，我们可以搜查他的房子。
If we hold back, we can search his house.

600
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,920
当那个律师建议他接受无评论的采访时。
While that solicitor advises him to give a no-comment interview.

601
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,199
我们让他由医生签字。
Let's get him signed off by a doctor.

602
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,800
而当我们采访他的时候，你不会在任何地方接近他。
And when we do interview him, you won't be anywhere near him.

603
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,999
我们采访了几位参加你母亲葬礼的哀悼者
We spoke to several of the mourners

604
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,719
周一参加你母亲守灵的人。
who attended your mother's wake on Monday.

605
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,359
其中不少于三个人
And no less than three of them

606
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,119
确认你是在晚上8点半左右离开俱乐部的。
confirm that you left the club around 8:30pm.

607
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,919
他们肯定搞错了。
They must have got that wrong.

608
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,479
他们还说你喝了很多酒。
They also said you'd been drinking heavily.

609
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,280
我刚刚埋葬了我的母亲。
I'd just buried my mum.

610
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,239
你告诉我们，你不知道帕特里克-艾略特住在哪里。
You told us that you didn't know where Patrick Elliot lived.

611
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,079
这倒是。
That's right.

612
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,799
但我们在他的公寓里到处都发现了你的指纹。
But we found your prints all over his flat.

613
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,040
你能解释一下它们是怎么到那里的吗？
Can you explain how they got there?

614
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,360
你没有义务回答这个问题。
You're under no obligation to answer that.

615
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,800
我去了一趟，去归还我借的一本书。
I went round to, to return a book that I'd borrowed.

616
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,439
肯定是几周前。
Must have been a couple of weeks ago.

617
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,559
所以你告诉我们你从未去过那里时是在撒谎？
So you lied when you told us that you'd never been there?

618
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,399
我不应该和他有联系。
I wasn't supposed to be in contact with him.

619
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,199
我不想惹上麻烦。哪本书？
I didn't wanna get in trouble. Which book?

620
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,799
什么？书名是什么？
What? What was the title?

621
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,000
这是他的... ... 他的一本治疗书。
It was one of his... one of his therapy books.

622
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,319
他认为这本书对我有好处
He thought it might be good for me to read.

623
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,839
我们有一个证人可以证明你在Framley庄园
We have a witness who can place you on the Framley Estate

624
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,199
在帕特里克-埃利奥特被谋杀的那个晚上。
on the night that Patrick Elliot was murdered.

625
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,800
她从一排人中选出了你的脸。
She picked your face out of a line-up.

626
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,439
这就是... 这是... 这是他想...
This is... This is... This is him trying to...

627
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,239
试图陷害我。这就是他想做的事。
Trying to set me up. This is what he's trying to do.

628
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,360
戴-雷德利！他在试图陷害我！他在试图陷害我！
DI Ridley! He's trying to set me up! He's trying to set me up!

629
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,880
你们都没看到吗？
Can none of you see it?!

630
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,320
你知道吗... 你知道什么吗？
And do you know... Do you know something?

631
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,040
他对我一无所知。
He's got nothing on me.

632
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,719
我们有一个CSI小组，卡尔，在你母亲的房子周围。
We've got a CSI team, Cal, round at your mother's house.

633
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,359
他们正在寻找能把你和这件事联系起来的证据。
They're searching for evidence that can tie you to this.

634
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,000
嗯，他们不会找到任何东西。
Well, they're not gonna find anything.

635
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,519
你在你母亲的葬礼上穿的那些衣服。
Those clothes that you wore to your mother's funeral.

636
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,599
它们被装在袋子里准备处理。
They were bagged up ready for disposal,

637
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,279
昨天我们来找你谈话的时候，它们被装在袋子里准备处理，不是吗？
yesterday, when we came round to talk to you, weren't they?

638
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,879
我已经告诉你了--它们是我母亲的衣服。
I've told you - they were my mother's clothes.

639
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,080
你和帕特里克的关系曾经是性关系吗？
Was your relationship with Patrick ever sexual?

640
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,679
我认为这个问题不合适。
I don't think that question's appropriate.

641
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,480
除非他有什么要隐瞒的？
Unless he's got something to hide?

642
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,080
我们很亲密。
We were close.

643
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,600
我们建立了一种联系。
We'd made a connection.

644
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,399
也许他误读了这些迹象，我不知道。
Maybe he misread the signs, I don't know.

645
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,319
你是说他向你示好？
Are you saying that he came on to you?

646
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,919
因为我发誓我没有看到它的到来。
Cos I swear I didn't see it coming.

647
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,199
我以为我可以信任他。
I thought I could trust him.

648
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,840
他在啜泣
HE SOBS

649
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,560
问题是，卡尔...
The thing is, Cal...

650
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,519
...我认为帕特里克-艾略特不再接你的电话。
..I think that Patrick Elliot stopped taking your calls.

651
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,359
然后你就去了那里，和他吵了起来。没有。
And then you went over there to have it out with him. No.

652
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,039
他对你做了一个笨拙的传球，你失去了它。
And he made a clumsy pass at you, you lost it.

653
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,440
然后你就发火了。不，我不在那里！
And then you lashed out. No, I wasn't there!

654
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,479
我想我们应该休会一下。
I think we should take a short recess.

655
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
好吧。
OK.

656
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,719
你为什么要保护Cal Flannery?
Why are you protecting Cal Flannery?

657
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,719
他是一个脆弱的成年人，有一些根深蒂固的潜在创伤。
He's a vulnerable adult with some deep-rooted underlying trauma.

658
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,479
我的工作是确保他得到公正的听证。
It's my job to make sure he gets a fair hearing.

659
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,519
我们有电话。
We've got phone calls.

660
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,319
我们有指纹。我们已经得到了一个肯定的身份。
We've got fingerprints. We've got a positive ID.

661
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,319
而且与公众可能认为的相反，
And contrary to what the public might think,

662
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,479
我们不是在缝合人的业务。
we're not in the business of stitching people up.

663
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,079
卡尔表现出典型的自恋特征。
Cal displays classic traits of narcissism.

664
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,199
他自我陶醉，容易自怜自艾。
He's self-obsessed and prone to self-pity.

665
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,599
他缺乏同情心，很容易被人误解。
His lack of empathy could easily be misconstrued.

666
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,719
所以没有内疚。没有悔意。
So no guilt. No remorse.

667
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,040
也许应该质疑的是你的判断力。
Maybe it's your judgement that should be called into question.

668
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,040
你这样说到底是什么意思？对亚当-唐纳利的定罪。
What exactly do you mean by that? The Adam Donnelly conviction.

669
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,879
都是基于卡尔的哥哥提供的证据。
All based on evidence provided by Cal's brother.

670
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,319
迈克尔-弗兰纳里与此毫无关系。
Michael Flannery has nothing to do with this.

671
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,960
我读了关于火灾的资料，你的家人发生了什么。
I read up on the fire, what happened to your family.

672
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,879
像这样失去他们两个一定很痛苦。
It must have been so hard, losing them both like that.

673
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,439
是的。是的，我们... 我们正在努力克服它。是的。
Yeah. Yes, we are... We're working through it. Yeah.

674
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,639
如果你需要找人谈谈，我是个很好的倾听者。
If you needed to talk to someone, I'm a good listener.

675
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,639
是的。谢谢。谢谢你的提议。
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for the offer.

676
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,719
一个问题的分享。另一个观点。
A problem shared. Another perspective.

677
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,800
谈论它总是有帮助的。
It always helps to talk it out.

678
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,799
你从不记录你的会议吗？
Do you never record your sessions?

679
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,639
帕特里克是否记录过他的会议？
Does Patrick ever record his sessions?

680
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,519
他可能已经做了，偶尔会做。
He may have done, on occasion.

681
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,799
它们会被保存在哪里呢？在练习场？
And where would they be kept? At the practice?

682
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,280
这是不可能的。他把大部分的工作都带回家了。
It's unlikely. He'd taken most of his work home with him.

683
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,960
好的。
OK.

684
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,559
雷德利？哦。
Ridley? Oh.

685
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,799
还在努力工作吗？
Still hard at it?

686
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,119
我们要花几天时间来处理整个场景。
It will take us a few days to process the whole scene.

687
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,119
嗯。是的。
Mm. Yeah.

688
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,839
你介意我再看一下吗？
Do you mind if I have another look around?

689
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,079
我们已经把大部分东西装箱，作为证据记录下来了。
We've boxed most of it up and logged it as evidence,

690
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,799
但是，是的。
but yeah.

691
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,800
谢谢你。
Thank you.

692
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,279
卡尔："他们停止了我妈妈的治疗。
CAL ON TAPE: 'They're stopping my mum's treatment.'

693
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,519
PATRICK ON TAPE: '很抱歉听到这个消息，卡尔。
PATRICK ON TAPE: 'Sorry to hear that, Cal.'

694
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,600
'他们无能为力。
'Nothing they can do.'

695
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,519
我关心的每个人，他们最后总是要离开我。
Everyone I care about, they always end up leaving me.

696
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,079
你在我们的最后一次会议上告诉我
You told me in our last session

697
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,359
说是你哥哥把你带大的。
that it was your brother who brought you up.

698
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,680
我爸爸在我小的时候就离开了。
My dad left when I was small.

699
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,200
妈妈在那之后也放弃了。
Mum gave up after that.

700
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,760
你仰慕迈克尔？
You looked up to Michael?

701
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,559
对他感到抱歉。
Felt sorry for him.

702
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,040
你想谈谈他们把他送进监狱时你的感受吗？
Would you like to talk about how you felt when they sent him to prison?

703
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,080
我不想谈这个。
I don't want to talk about that.

704
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,880
'他谋杀了两个女人。
'He murdered two women.'

705
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,719
'他从不认为那晚有人在家。
'He never thought there was anyone home that night.'

706
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,719
没有开灯。
No light on.

707
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,760
车道上没有车...
No car on the driveway...

708
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,360
火焰在几秒钟内占据了上风。
Flames took hold in seconds.

709
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,560
'从未想过它会像这样被烧毁'。
'Never thought it would burn through like that.'

710
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,920
情绪激动地吸气
INHALES EMOTIONALLY

711
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,600
衣服有几周的汽油味。
Clothes stank of petrol for weeks.

712
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,639
我妈妈试图清洗它们。
Me mum tried to wash them,

713
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,520
但她无法洗掉衣服上的气味。只是......挥之不去。
but she couldn't get the smell out of them. Just... lingered.

714
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,519
你是不是想告诉我什么，卡尔？
Is there something you're trying to tell me, Cal?

715
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,040
你能把那东西关掉吗？
Will you turn that thing off?

716
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,160
警车警笛响起
POLICE CAR SIREN BLARES

717
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,039
不，雷德利！
No, Ridley!

718
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,319
等等，凯特！
Wait! Kate!

719
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,080
艾拉！凯特！
Ella! Kate!

720
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,759
不，不，不，不！
No! No! No!

721
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,199
玻璃碎裂
GLASS SMASHES

722
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,000
雷德利的声音
RIDLEY SOBS

723
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,319
你知道，我今晚可以一直呆在家里。
You know, I could always stay home this evening.

724
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,839
哦，你不觉得我们会想念你吗？
Oh, you don't think you'd be missed?

725
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,720
盛大的庆祝活动？是的。
The big celebration? Yeah.

726
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,359
艾拉怎么了？
What's going on with Ella?

727
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,959
我以为她和欧文是... ... 爱情的年轻梦想和所有这些。
I thought her and Owen were... love's young dream and all that.

728
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,719
显然，她和另一个女孩有一些历史。哦，我明白了。
Some history with another girl, apparently. Oh, I see.

729
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,040
我可以听到你，你知道吗？哦。
I can hear you, you know? Oh.

730
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,599
在我的时代，你会在这个时候送花的。
In my day, you'd've sent flowers at this point.

731
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,800
你太老派了，爸爸。这没什么不对的。
You're so old-school, Dad. Nothing wrong with that.

732
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,479
还是没有响起。哦，亲爱的。
Still hasn't rung. Oh, darling.

733
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,919
听着，等我回来的时候，这一切都会被解决的。
Look, by the time I get back, this'll all be sorted.

734
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,439
如果他还没有打电话来的话。
And if he hasn't phoned,

735
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,480
他不是那个人。再见，爸爸。
he's not the one. See you, Dad.

736
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,999
为什么我总是最后一个知道？
Why am I always the last to know?

737
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,639
因为你从来不在这里，亚历克斯。
Cos you're never here, Alex.

738
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,199
是啊，现在，我们已经得到了亚当・唐纳利撞了起来，
Yeah, well, now that we've got Adam Donnelly banged up,

739
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,399
在这里，是一个很大的平静。我可以告诉你。
be a lot calmer around here. I can tell you.

740
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,679
嗯！不知道有多少次我已经听到了。
Mm! Wonder how many times I've heard that before.

741
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,759
听着，我只是显示我在酒吧的脸。
Listen, I'll just show me face at the pub.

742
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,680
我很快就会回来。
I'll be back in no time.

743
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,760
哼！
Hm!

744
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,759
请大家注意，我可以吗？就一会儿。
Can I have everyone's attention? Just for a moment.

745
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,879
经过长达一年的调查，
After a year-long investigation,

746
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,319
我们已经成功地关闭了Adam Donnelly的组织。
we have managed to close down Adam Donnelly's organisation.

747
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,519
所以，让我们喝上几杯。这是你应得的。
So let's have a few drinks. You deserve it.

748
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,799
我只想提醒明天值班的警探们
I'll just remind any detectives who are on call tomorrow

749
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,959
你应该在午夜前上床睡觉。
that you should be tucked up in bed by midnight.

750
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,360
笑声
LAUGHTER

751
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,279
今天早上我在法庭上听了判决。
I was in court this morning for the verdict.

752
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,039
14年，雷德利。
14 years, Ridley.

753
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,719
是的，他表现好的话会被判十年。
Yeah. He'll do ten with good behaviour.

754
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,199
我们完成了工作。
We got the job done.

755
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,879
我一直在跟迈克尔-弗兰纳里说。
I've been speaking to Michael Flannery.

756
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,039
他告诉我唐纳利一直在威胁要杀他。
He tells me Donnelly's been threatening to kill him.

757
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,759
有任何威胁被证实了吗?
Have any threats been corroborated?

758
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,759
哦，来吧，保罗。这需要一个干预。
Oh, come on, Paul. This needs an intervention.

759
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,359
我保证过我们会保护他。
I promised we'd protect him.

760
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,359
你觉得Donnelly会放过这个机会吗?
You think Donnelly's gonna let this go?

761
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,239
你跑了他的书，雷德利，但确定。
You ran him off book, Ridley, but OK.

762
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,479
我会把它与ACC。看看她能不能拉点关系。
I'll bring it up with the ACC. See if she can pull some strings.

763
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,919
我希望如此。
Well, I hope so,

764
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,639
因为如果我们的线人最后脑袋中了子弹，
because if our source ends up with a bullet in his head,

765
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,960
这场庆祝会就会显得有点不伦不类了。
this celebration's gonna look a bit previous.

766
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,240
液体滴落
LIQUID TRICKLES

767
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,240
火柴敲击
MATCH STRIKES

768
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,240
火焰咆哮
FLAMES ROAR

769
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,200
火焰噼啪作响
FIRE CRACKLES

770
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,000
嗡嗡声
BUZZER

771
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,560
没想到会有人来访。
Wasn't expecting a visit.

772
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,480
你哥哥被逮捕了。
Your brother's been arrested.

773
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,120
他应该做什么？
What's he supposed to have done?

774
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,839
我们已经逮捕了他，与他的治疗师的谋杀案有关。
We've arrested him in connection with the murder of his therapist.

775
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,880
卡尔还没有得到它在他身上。
Cal hasn't got it in him.

776
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,439
但我们都知道这不是真的，迈克尔，不是吗？
Except we both know that's not true, Michael, don't we?

777
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,680
你说什么？你已经失去了我。
Sorry? You've lost me.

778
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,840
他的治疗师记录了他们所有的会议。
His therapist recorded all their sessions.

779
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,720
卡尔说的每一句话。
Everything Cal said.

780
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,800
火灾那晚？
The night of the fire?

781
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,959
他记得每一个细节。
He remembered every detail.

782
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,200
我有责任照顾他。
It were down to me to look after him.

783
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,439
让他远离麻烦。房子的主人，嗯？
Keep him out of trouble. The man of the house, eh?

784
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,719
必须有人站出来。
Someone had to step up.

785
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,119
什么，为你神圣的母亲分担负担？
What, to take the load off your sainted mother?

786
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,119
你不要把她扯进来。雷德利笑着说
You leave her out of this. RIDLEY CHUCKLES

787
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,199
我打赌，你被送下去的那天，她很高兴看到你的背影。
I bet the day you were sent down, she was glad to see the back of you.

788
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,119
闭嘴吧! 可悲的儿子的借口。
Shut up! Pathetic excuse of a son.

789
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,199
你为两起谋杀案背了黑锅，但你并没有犯罪。
You took the rap for two murders, you didn't commit.

790
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,039
什么样的男人会这么做？是我干的。是我。我杀了他们。
What kind of a man does that? I did it. Me. I killed 'em.

791
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,319
是的，只是你已经走了。
Yeah, except you were already gone.

792
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,839
我们接你的时候你已经在去伦敦的半路上了。
You were halfway down the road to London when we picked you up.

793
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,560
我弟弟在这里能活多久？不会持续一个星期！
How long would my brother survive here? Wouldn't last a week!

794
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,280
米歇尔-胡夫斯
MICHAEL HUFFS

795
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,960
在审判前的那几个月里。
All those months leading up to the trial.

796
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,879
所有那些监狱探访。你对我撒谎了。
All those prison visits. You lied to me.

797
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,520
我告诉你你想听的。他耍了你，迈克尔。
I told you what you wanted to hear. He played you, Michael.

798
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,800
就像他玩弄其他所有人一样。
Like he played everyone else.

799
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,159
他让你因为你没有犯下的罪行而被判终身监禁。
He got you sent down for life for a crime you didn't commit.

800
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,679
被关在隔离区，不敢到院子里去。
Banged up on the seg wing, afraid to go into the yard.

801
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,520
多亏了你。
Thanks to you.

802
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,679
你以为你在照顾他。
You think you're looking after him.

803
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,159
他为你做过什么？
What's he ever done for you?

804
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,080
把他交出来，迈克尔。告诉我们真相。
Give him up, Michael. Tell us the truth.

805
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,840
我想我们就到此为止了。
I think we're done here.

806
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,920
敲门
KNOCKS ON DOOR

807
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,359
你想和我谈谈？
You wanted to talk to me?

808
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,559
那间公寓被翻出来是有原因的。
There's a reason why that flat was turned over.

809
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,479
卡尔-弗兰纳里在找东西。
Cal Flannery was looking for something.

810
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,919
他在找这些东西。
He was looking for these.

811
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,439
这些是他和帕特里克-艾略特之间的录音记录。
These are the recording sessions between him and Patrick Elliot.

812
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,959
我在我们的一个证物箱里发现了它们的包装袋。
I found them bagged up in one of our evidence boxes.

813
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,239
你从犯罪现场拿走了证据？
You've removed evidence from a crime scene?!

814
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,119
不，不，听我说。听我说。
No, no, listen to me. Listen to me.

815
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:40,759
如果卡尔-弗兰纳里已经承认了之前的谋杀案，
If Cal Flannery had confessed to a previous murder,

816
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,279
那他就有足够的动机想要帕特里克-埃利奥特死。
that's motive enough for him to want Patrick Elliot dead.

817
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,319
等一下，以前的谋杀案？
Hang on, a previous murder?

818
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,040
雷德利 我们刚把他从拘留所放出来
Ridley, we've just released him from custody.

819
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,039
你们放了他？
You've let him go?!

820
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,079
也许如果你早点把证据带给我，
Maybe if you had brought me the evidence earlier,

821
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,959
我就有东西可以指控他了。
I would've had something to charge him with.

822
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,479
你把我赶出了这个案子，卡罗尔。
You threw me off the case, Carol.

823
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,399
你知道吗，你对古德温的态度超出了我的想象。
You know, you went over my head to Goodwin.

824
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,679
我为你出头了
I went out on a limb for you

825
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,719
当别人都说你是受损的货物时
when everyone else said you were damaged goods.

826
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,519
来吧，你需要我。每个人都需要我。
Come on, you needed me. Everybody needed me.

827
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,399
当你需要休息的时候，我就是你要找的人!
I'm who you go to when you need to catch a break!

828
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,920
这是严重的不端行为，我必须报告它。
This is serious misconduct, and I'm gonna have to report it.

829
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,160
卡尔-弗兰纳里谋杀了凯特和艾拉。
Cal Flannery murdered Kate and Ella.

830
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,119
而出于某种扭曲的原因，他的兄弟在为他打掩护。
And for some twisted reason, his brother is covering for him.

831
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,400
现在，看在上帝的份上，快去找他吧!
Now, for Christ's sake, get out there and find him!

832
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,759
你有一个来自迈克尔-弗兰纳里的电话。
OPERATOR: 'You have a call from Michael Flannery,

833
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,440
"布拉德菲尔德女王监狱的一名囚犯。
'an inmate of Her Majesty's Prison, Bradfield.

834
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,840
"如果你想接受这个电话，请按1。
'If you wish to accept this call, press one.'

835
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,159
迈克尔? 告诉我你没有杀他。
Michael? Tell me you didn't kill him.

836
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,839
没事的。他们让我走了。这不是我问你的，卡尔。
It's fine. They let me go. That's not what I asked you, Cal.

837
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,599
他把一切都记录下来了。
He had it all recorded.

838
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,639
他想去找警察。哦，上帝。
He wanted to go to the police. Oh, Jesus.

839
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,639
如果他们知道那些录音在哪里，
If they knew where those recordings were,

840
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,879
他们现在就已经起诉我了，不是吗？
they'd have charged me by now, wouldn't they?

841
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,719
雷德利来找过我。他已经听过它们了。
Ridley came to see me. He already listened to them.

842
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,120
你告诉他什么了？够了。
What did you tell him? Enough.

843
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,640
钮扣音
BUTTON TONE

844
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,520
卡尔？
Cal?

845
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,520
卡尔！
Cal!

846
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,359
他们在一个高速公路服务站把他接走了。
They picked him up at a motorway service station.

847
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,879
通过他的手机GPS找到了他。
Found him through his phone GPS.

848
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,719
他承认对纵火案负全责。
He's admitted sole responsibility for the arson attack.

849
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,680
我很抱歉，雷德利。I... 我不知道该说什么。
I'm so sorry, Ridley. I... I don't know what to say.

850
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,320
我只是不...
I just don't...

851
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,720
只是他做了什么...
Just what he did...

852
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,039
他怎么能伤害他们？
How he could hurt them?

853
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,200
他哭了
HE SOBS

854
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,840
我得问问...
I've got to ask...

855
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,519
卡尔-弗兰纳里的资料已经传给了所有的部队。
Cal Flannery's details have been circulated to all the forces.

856
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,719
听着 雷德利 我要把你从这次调查中撤出来
Look, Ridley, I'm removing you from this investigation.

857
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,959
我们需要讨论未来的顾问角色
We'll need to discuss any future consultancy role

858
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,000
如果你准备回来工作的话
if and when you're ready to come back to work.

859
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,039
你做了正确的事情，18个月前。
You did the right thing, 18 months ago,

860
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,760
以健康理由建议退休。
recommending retirement on medical grounds.

861
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,719
我真的对任何人都没有什么好处。
I really wasn't much good to anybody.

862
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,760
好吧，也许如果我听了你的警告...
Well, maybe if I'd listened when you'd warned me...

863
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,520
...他们今天还能活着。
..they'd still be alive today.

864
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,560
如果你没有阻止我，跑进那所房子...
And if you hadn't stopped me, running into that house...

865
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,920
...我可能已经和他们一起死在那里了。
..I might've died in there with them.

866
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,960
回家吧，雷德利。
Go home, Ridley.

867
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,800
CAL。雷德利？
CAL: Ridley?

868
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,520
雷德利？雷德利！
CAL SHOUTS: Ridley!

869
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,280
喊叫： 雷德利！
SHOUTS: Ridley!

870
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,400
砸碎玻璃
GLASS SMASHES

871
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,120
谢谢你。谢谢你。
RIDLEY: Thank you. Thank you.

872
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,480
有一辆巡逻车在路上。
There's a patrol car on the way.

873
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,319
他们会要一份声明。
They'll want a statement.

874
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,680
"没什么可担心的"，你说。
"Nothing to worry about", you said.

875
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,639
但这不是唐纳利的手笔。
But this wasn't Donnelly's handiwork.

876
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,639
好吧，有人要把我们吓坏了。
Well, someone is out to put the frighteners on us.

877
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,920
是啊... 现在我知道是谁了。
Yeah... and now I know who.

878
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,720
RATTLING
RATTLING

879
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,559
雷德利？
Ridley?

880
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,760
迈克尔-弗兰纳里为他的兄弟背了黑锅。
Michael Flannery took the rap for his brother.

881
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,440
是卡尔-弗兰纳里谋杀了凯特和艾拉。
It was Cal Flannery that murdered Kate and Ella.

882
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,959
但是，但是迈克尔认罪了。嗯，他认罪了。
But, but Michael confessed. Well, he pleaded guilty.

883
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,439
我当时在法庭上，我听到了他的话。
I was there in the court, I heard him.

884
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,479
他在证人席上描述了房子的情况。每一个细节。
He described the house in the witness box. Every detail.

885
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,159
我记得他的脸。
I remember his face.

886
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,279
他看着他母亲时的羞愧。
The shame when he looked at his mother.

887
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,919
我知道，但他从卡尔那里得到了所有这些东西。
I know, but he got all that stuff from Cal.

888
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,839
唐纳利是为了迈克尔的血。他想让他死。
Donnelly was after Michael's blood. He wanted him dead.

889
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,519
他告诉卡尔，这一切都归功于我。
And he told Cal it was all down to me.

890
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,759
而卡尔，他只是无法应付他哥哥背叛的想法。
And Cal, he just couldn't cope with the idea of his brother's betrayal.

891
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,799
所以他决定要报复。
So he decided to get even.

892
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,159
但为什么迈克尔要为他打掩护？在他所做的一切之后？
But why would Michael cover for him? After everything he'd done?

893
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,240
家人，安妮。
Families, Annie.

894
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,640
他们只会不择手段。
They just do whatever it takes.

895
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,480
你知道，自从...
You know, ever since...

896
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,200
...凯特和艾拉死后，你就像...
..Kate and Ella died, it's like you've just...

897
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,279
...你就一直把他们放在冰冷的地方。
..you've just kept them in aspic.

898
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,160
躲在所有那些案子后面。
Hiding behind all those cases.

899
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,120
别人的悲痛。

905
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,120
嗡嗡声
HUMMING

906
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,320
雷德利？
Ridley?

907
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,039
抬起头来。你没事吧？
'Ey up. You all right?

908
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,840
是的，你还好吗？是的，很好。

909
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,399
嘿，他很快就会回来了。他没有锁门。
Hey, he'll be home soon. He left the door unlocked.

910
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,200
是的，他总是把门打开。
Yeah, he always leaves it open.

911
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,119
你是他的朋友，然后呢？
You a friend of his, then?

912
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,559
他曾经和我哥哥一起敲打过。
He used to knock around with my brother.

913
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,999
哦，我只是过来在船上工作的。
Oh, I've just come over to work on the boat.

914
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,799
一直在一起做。

915
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,879
你有吗？是的。
Have you? Yeah.

916
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,440
他一定是忘了。我会试着给他打电话。
He must have forgotten. I'll try and call him.

917
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,000
我不能... 让你这么做。
I can't... let you do that.

918
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,920
把枪放在桌子上
TAPS GUN ON TABLE

919
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,359
DS Farman。

现在是探长。

你哥哥已经被抓起来了。他是三起谋杀案的嫌疑人。
Your brother's gone to ground. He's in the frame for three murders.

922
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,599
如果你有任何证据，你就不会放他走。
If you had any proof of that, you never would've let him go.

923
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,999
雷德利已经把那些录音交出来了。
Ridley's already handed those recordings over.

924
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,159
这足以让卡尔下台。让你清白。
That's enough to send Cal down. Puts you in the clear.

925
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,719
所以呢 你是来赔罪的 还是来给Ridley收拾烂摊子的?
So what, you're here to make amends, or to clean up Ridley's mess?

926
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,800
我们知道是你给卡尔通风报信 我让他去自首
We know you tipped Cal off. I asked him to turn himself in.

927
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,599
考虑到你以前对我们说过的那些谎言
Well, bearing in mind all those lies that you've told us before,

928
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,319
你可以理解为什么我们可能不相信你。

929
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,039
迈克尔，他已经杀了三个人。

930
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,440
你必须帮助我们找到他。

931
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:10,199
卡尔知道你在找他。没有什么可失去的了
Cal knows you're onto him. Nothing left to lose.

932
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,919
如果我了解我哥哥 他一定是去找Ridley了
If I know my brother, he's going after Ridley.

933
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,600
他可能有武器吗？

934
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,480
扣动扳机

01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,319
警报器响起
SIREN BLARES

I'm on route to The Boat House in Hepton Water.

We are dealing with a suspect in connection with a murder.

942
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,159
罪犯可能有武器。我重复，他可能有武器，而且很危险。

943
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,640
要求武装反应部队参加。
Requesting armed response unit to attend.

944
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,999
'卡尔？卡尔，我是雷德利。

945
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,639
'你在里面吗？
'Are you in there?'

946
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,440
听着，我已经去了俱乐部。我收到了你的信息。
Listen, I've been to the club. I got your message.

947
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,040

'你在里面吗？

01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,960
把枪放下！
Put that gun down!

952
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:32,479
听着，你要的是我，那个男孩与此无关。
Listen, it's me you want, that boy has got nothing to do with this.

953
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,959
我不在乎，他不应该来这里！
I don't care, he shouldn't have been here!

954
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,119
是的，我知道。但你不能用枪指着一个孩子的头。
Yes, I know. But you can't hold a gun to a child's head.

955
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,680
绑架未成年人对你来说不会有好结果，卡尔。
Abducting a minor is not gonna go good for you here, Cal.

956
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,999
让这孩子离开这里，让他走...
Just let the boy walk out of here, just let him go...

957
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,559
我们可以一起解决这个问题。
and we can sort this out together.

958

961
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,439
他认为你脑子不清楚。
He thinks you're not thinking straight.

962
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,319
他一直在照顾你，不是吗？
He's always looked after you, hasn't he?

963
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,999
不，不！不，迈克尔的问题是，他很脆弱。
No, no! No, the thing with Michael is, he's weak.

964
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,279
他是个软弱的人。他跑掉了，没办法解决。
He's a weak man. He ran away, couldn't hack it.

965
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,919
总得有人来还你钱。
Someone had to pay you back.

966

好吧，现在是你的机会。来吧，我在这里。
Well, now's your chance. Come on, I'm here.

让那个小伙子走吧！
Just let that lad go!

968
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,119
把枪放下。
Put the gun down.

969
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,679
我们可以一起解决这个问题。只是男人对男人。来吧。
We can sort this out together. Just man to man. Come on.

970
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,720

你跟杰克说了吗？'没有'。

I've tried his mobile and he isn't picking up.

974

我想他说他要去雷德利的地方了。
'I think he said he was going over to Ridley's place.'

975
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,800
你认为他们在整理船？
Think they were finishing the boat?

976
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,920
'我再给你打电话。

雷德利喊道。去吧，杰克！
RIDLEY SHOUTS: Go on, Jack!

987
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,760
发动机发出轰鸣声

988
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,559
滑行至停滞不前

哦，亲爱的。
Oh, sweetheart.

995
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,479
他和雷德利还在里面。他有一把枪。
He's in there with Ridley still. He's got a gun.

996
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,919
我需要你告诉我到底发生了什么，好吗？好吗？
I need you to tell me exactly what's happening, OK? All right?

997
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,960
好的。来吧，你做得很好。

998
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,519
你会试着说服我放弃的。
You're gonna try and talk me out of it.

999
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,400
这是计划吗？是的。
Is that the plan? Yeah.

1000
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,440
差不多吧，是的。卡尔笑着说

是的。非常安静。
Yeah. Very quiet.

1004
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,920
这是个漂亮的房子。
It's a beautiful house.

1005
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,880
它是否给你... ...一个机会去想他们？
Does it give you... a-a chance to think about them?

1006
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,480
是的。
Yeah.

1007
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:07,800

I've had a lot of time to think about my wife and daughter, Cal.

1008
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,279

我听了那些录音，卡尔。
I listened to those recordings, Cal.

1010
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,119
你和帕特里克-艾略特的录音。

SHOUTS: You murdered Kate and Ella!

1013
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,279
不，那是胡说八道！
No. That's bullshit!

1014
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,839
那份供词在法庭上是站不住脚的，永远站不住脚。永远站不住脚！
That confession would never, never hold up in court. Never stand up!

1015
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,959
那你为什么要杀帕特里克-艾略特？
So why did you kill Patrick Elliot?

1016
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,279
因为他背叛了我。
Because he betrayed me.

紧急敲门声

01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,880
听着... 你不能再到这里来了。
Look... You can't come round here any more.

1022
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,240
我已经告诉你了。感性地呼出一口气
I've already told you that. EXHALES EMOTIONALLY

1023
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,760
我妈妈死了。
My mum died.

1024
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,359
是的。来吧... 没关系的。来吧。
Yeah. Come on... It's all right. Come on.

1025
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,439
"我想他只是看穿了你。
'I think he just saw through you.'

1026
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,119
我想他看到了你真正的男人。
I think he saw the man that you really are.

1027
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,960
我告诉他一些我从未告诉过别人的事情。
EMOTIONALLY: I told him things I'd never told anyone.

1028
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,719
我一直在想我们上次的谈话。
I've been thinking about our last session.

1029
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,959
我们谈的那些事。是的。
The things we talked about. Yeah.

1030
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,679
我信任他。而他却陷害了我。
I trusted him. And he set me up.

1031
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,720
你需要向警方自首。

我一直认为我们在一起很好，你和我。

当然，我们是。

1167
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,520
我是说，这工作，这时间，你知道。
I mean, the job, the hours, you know.

1168
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,800
如果我可以回到过去，解决这一切... ...
If I could go back and fix all that...

1169
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,960
我真的很想你，凯特。
I really miss you, Kate.

1170
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:11,039
完成了那艘船，然后呢？是的，最终。

让我们把她开到岛上去。

1172
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,000
来吧！

1173
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,640
现在很美。
It's beautiful now.

1174
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,679
听说他们要让你出院了。
Heard they were discharging you.

1175
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,039
我真的很高兴看到我的背影，告诉你真相。
Really glad to see the back of me, to tell you the truth.

1176
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,359
你感觉如何？
How you feeling?

1177
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,959
嗯，很好。很好。
Yeah, fine. Good.

1178
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,919
我只是想感谢你把杰克安全地救出来。
I just wanted to thank you for getting Jack out of there safely.

1179
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,159
雷德利叹了口气，他的身体怎么样了？
RIDLEY SIGHS How's he bearing up?

1180
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,759
是的，他很好。他有点受惊，但...
Yeah, he's all right. He's a bit shaken up, but...

1181
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,919
很高兴听到这个消息。
Glad to hear it.

1182
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,919
我们都说了一些不是故意的事。
We both said some things that we didn't mean.

1183
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,159
那是一时冲动，不是吗？
It was the heat of the moment, wasn't it?

1184
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,719
哼！你想搭车吗？
Hm! Do you fancy a lift?

1185
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,999
今天天气不错，我很好。
It's a lovely day, I'm OK.

1186
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,159
周五晚上想去吃点东西吗？听起来像是个计划。
Fancy a bite to eat Friday night? Sounds like a plan.

1187
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,599
我有一个案子，我不介意和你谈谈。
I've got a case I wouldn't mind talking to you about.

1188
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,240
哈! 哦，是吗？
Ha! Oh, yeah?

1189
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,400
一颗子弹击中头部。
A bullet to the head.

1190
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,400
你现在明白了吗？
You see now?

1191
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,960
你明白我为什么要保护他了吧？
You see why I had to protect him?

1192
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,280
卡尔是为了报仇，迈克尔。
Cal was out for revenge, Michael.

1193
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,079
我可能已经阻止了他。如果我没有被关在这里的话。
I might've stopped him. If I hadn't been locked up in here.

1194
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,840
不，你无能为力。
No, there was nothing you could do.

1195
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,399
不管怎样，你不会被关得太久了。
And anyway, you won't be locked up for much longer.

1196
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,319
我听说已经为你的释放做了安排。
I hear arrangements have been made for your release.

1197
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,399
而亚当-唐纳利会等着我。
And Adam Donnelly will be waiting for me.

1198
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:48,280
不，DCI，他已经和公诉机关达成了协议。
No. The DCI, he's done a deal with the Public Prosecution Service.

1199
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,759
他们会给予你证人保护身份。
They're gonna grant you witness protection status.

1200
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,960
你会被送到Adam Donnelly永远找不到你的地方。
You're gonna be sent somewhere where Adam Donnelly can never find you.

1201
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,880
你这么做是为了我?
You did that for me?

1202
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,919
在发生了这么多事之后?
After everything that's happened?

1203
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:06,040
我是为了你才这么做的，因为已经发生的一切。
I'm doing it for you BECAUSE of everything that's happened.

1204
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,520
再见，迈克尔。
Bye, Michael.

1205
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,560
雷德利。
Ridley.

1206
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,560
爵士乐响起
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

1207
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,679
好吧，如果我知道你要来，我就会吹起几个气球。
Well, if I'd known you were coming, I'd have blown up a few balloons.

1208
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,759
这就是为什么我没有警告你我要来。
That's why I didn't warn you I was coming.

1209
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,759
你不是应该在家里翘着脚吗？
Shouldn't you be at home with your feet up?

1210
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,039
我已经在床上躺了两个星期了。无论如何，我已经回家了。
I've been in bed for two weeks. Anyway, I AM home.

1211
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,319
你让我担心了好一阵子。
You had me worried there for a while.

1212
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,319
哦，别担心，我想我能行。
Oh, don't worry, I think I'll manage.

1213
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,839
我还会在这里待上一段时间。
I'll be around for a bit yet.

1214
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,399
现在，你确定你可以唱歌了吗？
Now, are you sure you're all right to sing?

1215
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,839
我们不希望你撕开那些缝线。
We don't want you tearing those stitches.

1216
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,839
不，我想我能行，谢谢你。
No, I think I can manage, thank you.

1217
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,319
好吧，尽量不要从凳子上摔下来，好吗？
Well, try not to fall off that stool, OK?

1218
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,880
闭嘴，把外套给我。她笑着说
Shut up and just get me the jacket. SHE CHUCKLES

1219
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,720
