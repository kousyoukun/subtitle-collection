1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,038
薇薇安，你必须忘记我。他去了伦敦。雷德利路。
Vivien, you have to forget about me. He's gone to London. Ridley Road.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,678
我在找杰克-莫里斯。
I'm looking for Jack Morris.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,678
犹太人是欧洲的破坏者。
The Jews are the saboteurs of Europe.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,478
杰克？
Jack?

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,880
我对坏人做了坏事。
I do bad things to bad people.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,358
我们没有杰克的消息。你不知道怎么去找他。
We haven't heard from Jack. You have no idea how to get to him.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,038
如果他有一个女孩呢？她可能会意外地出现。
What if he had a girl? She could just turn up unexpectedly.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,798
跟我回去吧。你认为你可以带着你最好的玛丽莲印象来到这里
Come back with me. You think you can come here with your best Marilyn

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,598
勾引这些疯子放弃他们的观点？
impression and seduce these nutters out of their views?

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,318
你被我吓到了吗？没有。
Are you frightened of me? No.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,880
给你。一定是掉了。
Here you go. Must have dropped it.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,958
你有什么问题？
What's your problem?

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,518
到侧门去吧。你是个肮脏的犹太佬。
Make your way to the side door. You're a filthy Yid.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,998
李被打了，他起不来了。我们得走了，伙计。
Lee's been beaten and he can't get up. We gotta go, mate.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,358
我们不能就这样离开他，伙计。这栋楼就要烧起来了
We can't just leave him, mate. This building is about to go up

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,038
火焰中。犹太暴徒。
in flames. Jewish thugs.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,840
我们会给警察提供名字和地址，转移注意力。
We'll give the police names and addresses, divert attention.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,280
简？
Jane?!

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,640
很高兴能找到你。
Very glad I found you.

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,998
在格林斯泰尔路住着一位女士
There lives a lady in Greensheet Road

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,158
她成长，她成长，她成长得如此甜蜜。
She grows, she grows, she grows so sweet.

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,838
和我一起唱吧！
Sing with me!

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,638
她在街尾呼唤着梯子。
That she calls for a ladder at the end of the street.

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,158
你可以比这更大声。
You can be louder than that.

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,998
亲爱的，亲爱的，你愿意嫁给我吗？
Sweetheart, sweetheart, will you marry me?

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,958
是的，上帝，是的，先生，三点半。
Yes, Lord, yes, sir, half past three.

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,560
保罗。你在哪里？爸爸来了！
Paul. Where are you? Daddy's coming!

28
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,200
让我们把你整理好，亲爱的。就这样吧。好孩子。
Let's tidy you up, darling. That's it. Good boy.

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,638
我们来了。我们会再来的。
Wir kommen wieder. Wir kommen wieder.

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,480
我们又来了。
We come again.

31
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,720
我会让他准备好。
I'll get him ready.

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,038
别上当！他们在愚弄你！别上当！
Don't fall for it! They're fooling you! Don't fall for it!

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,358
这不是纵火案！这不应该是一个犯罪现场！
This isn't an arson attack! This shouldn't be a crime scene!

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,518
这只是又一次上演的诽谤犹太社区的戏码!
This is just another staged attempt to slander the Jewish community!

35
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,118
警察真可耻！
Shame on the police!

36
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,558
好吧，现在还有点早，不是吗？我还没喝粥呢。
All right, it's a bit early, innit? I haven't even had me porridge yet.

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,758
来吧，往后站，小伙子，你知道该怎么做。
Come on, stand back, lad, you know the drill.

38
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,960
抓住希特勒漏掉的那几个人！
Get the Yids that Hitler missed!

39
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,120
哦，是的，你当然知道。
Oh, yeah, course you did.

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,080
典型的该死的纳粹。
Typical bleedin' Nazi.

41
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,078
帮我个忙。
Do me a favour.

42
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,558
你在笑，不是吗？
You're having a laugh, ain't ya?

43
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,998
所罗门-马林诺夫斯基，我以纵火罪嫌疑逮捕你。
Solomon Malinovsky, I'm arresting you on suspicion of arson.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,438
你不必说什么，但你所说的一切
You do not have to say anything, but anything you do say

45
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,080
可以作为证据提供。这是个圈套。铐住他。
may be given in evidence. It's a set-up. Cuff him.

46
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,440
喂，你以为你在做什么？喂！
Oi, what do you think you're doing? Oi!

47
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,918
你把你的脏手从我的存款上拿开。
You get your filthy mitts off my savings.

48
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,718
犯罪所得，伙计。现在是警察的财产。
Proceeds of crime, mate. Police property now.

49
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,958
这是个合法的生意。是吗？来吧，那么。
This is a legitimate business. Is it? Come on, then.

50
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,278
我知道那里有多少钱，对吗？
I know how much is there, right?

51
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,800
都签好字了，也都说好了。来吧，那么。
It's all signed and accounted for. Come on, then.

52
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,398
现在，我正努力按照维维的做法去做，但我有我自己的方式。
Now, I'm trying to do it exactly as Viv did it but I do have me own way.

53
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,438
你知道，我们都是不同的，不是吗？
You know, we're all different, aren't we?

54
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,718
不同的人有不同的招数。
Different strokes for different folks.

55
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,238
薇薇安不可能选一个更糟糕的日子来擅离职守。
Vivien couldn't have picked a worse day to go AWOL,

56
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,558
跟你说实话。老板又要搬家了。第五次
to be honest with you. Boss is moving house again. Fifth time

57
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,558
今年的第五次。而她的儿子已经是第十三次被关进牢房了。
this year. And her son's up in the banger for the umpteenth time.

58
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,358
他的事永远不会结束。现在，你想看一下后面吗？
Never ends with him. Now, do you want to have a look at the back?

59
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,360
好啊。是的，这很好。
Yeah. Yeah, it's lovely.

60
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,480
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

61
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,918
他要我们都下楼。
He wants us all downstairs.

62
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,560
但你说你会玩。不会太久的。
But you said you'd play. Won't be long.

63
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,760
简。
Jane.

64
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,920
早上好，彼得。
Good morning, Peter.

65
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,758
虽然来的很晚，但舰队街终于到了。
Pretty late to the game, but Fleet Street got there at last.

66
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,198
"犹太复国主义分子的袭击使警方束手无策
"Police at loss as Zionist attacks

67
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,638
"摧毁了英国党在伦敦的私人住宅。"
"destroy private London residence of British Party."

68
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,640
干得好。头版。好样的。聪明，先生。
Well done. Front page. Nice one. Brilliant, sir.

69
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,878
领导？你有什么问题吗？
Leader? What's wrong with you?

70
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,918
拜托。李应该在医院里。
Please. Lee should be in a hospital.

71
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,200
有适当的医生。
With, like, proper doctors.

72
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,998
他在这里活不下去的，他的情况太糟糕了。
He won't make it in here, he's in too bad a way.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,038
考虑到我们的卫生服务部门对外来疾病的处理是多么的千疮百孔，
Given how riddled our health services are with exotic illnesses,

74
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,238
我想说的是，他在这里再安全不过了。
I'd say he couldn't be in safer hands.

75
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,598
现在，我希望尽快恢复训练... 告诉他。
Now, I want training to resume as soon as possible... Tell him.

76
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,120
去吧，告诉他。
Go on, tell him.

77
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,280
告诉他什么？
Tell him what?

78
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,240
说吧。
Go on.

79
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,918
这并不重要。他要离开他。
It doesn't matter. He was going to leave him.

80
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,518
彼得要离开李，让他死掉。什么？
Peter was going to leave Lee for dead. What?

81
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,320
我不是那个意思。你是什么意思？
I didn't mean it that way. How did you mean it?

82
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,638
老实说，我不是... 你为什么会说那样的话？
Honestly, I wasn't... Why would you say a thing like that?

83
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,360
彼得？你能解释一下吗？
Peter? Care to explain?

84
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,998
我在看守洛克威尔先生，先生。
I was guarding Mr Rockwell, sir.

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,158
在他那边事情变得严重之前 然后那些犹太人就开始了猛攻。
Before things got heavy on his side. Then the Yids started storming.

86
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,360
不是吗？如果你记得的话，那是一场混乱。是的。这就对了。
Didn't they? It was mayhem, if you recall. Right. That's right.

87
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,318
杰夫告诉我李受伤了，但我没有看到他。
Jeff told me Lee had been hurt, but I hadn't seen him.

88
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,958
我不知道他处于什么状态。
I didn't know what state he was in.

89
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,558
正是如此。他没有看到他，先生。是的，我并不担心，因为...
Exactly. He hadn't seen him, sir. Yeah, I wasn't worried cos...

90
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,278
...他是个斗士，不是吗？强壮的小伙子。
..he's a fighter, isn't he? Strong lad.

91
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,038
但一看到杰夫的脸，好吧。
But one look at Jeff's face, well,

92
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,558
我就直奔主题了。不是吗，杰夫？
I got straight round there. Didn't I, Jeff?

93
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,878
是的，没错。说实话，这没什么。
You did, yeah. What? Honestly, it's nothing.

94
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,960
你说... 你说感觉不对，这是你说的。
You said... You said it felt off, that's what you said.

95
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,598
好吧，我想当李醒过来的时候，
Well, I suppose when Lee wakes up,

96
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,560
他就能自己告诉我们了，不是吗？
he'll be able to tell us himself, won't he?

97
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,598
是的。正是如此。
Yeah. Exactly.

98
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,040
如果。如果他醒过来，
If. If he wakes up.

99
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,998
简会照顾他。什么？
Jane will nurse him. What?

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,358
不，不，不，拜托，不是她。
No, no, no, please, not her.

101
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,438
我有三个姐妹。我明白，你身体里的荷尔蒙
I have three sisters. I understand, the hormones in your body

102
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,878
正在做着惊人的事情。
are doing spectacular things.

103
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,200
尽量不要让自己处于一种状态。为了孩子的缘故。
Try not to get yourself in a state. For the baby's sake.

104
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,320
带她去火车站。不，不，请，请。不！
Take her to the train station. No. No, please, please. No!

105
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,080
李，你能听到我吗？
Lee, can you hear me?

106
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
李？只是去给你换一下敷料。
Lee? Just going to change your dressings.

107
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,920
对不起，杰夫，我真的很抱歉。
Sorry, Jeff, I'm really sorry.

108
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,280
该死的，杰夫，伙计，等一下。
Damn, Jeff, mate, hang on.

109
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,478
从公爵的图书馆来的。
From the Duke's library.

110
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,758
我很难带着它离开，不是吗？那是偷窃。
Can hardly leave with it, can I? That'd be stealing.

111
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,960
你不会太久的，是吗？两分钟。
You won't be long, will ya? Two minutes.

112
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
简，你能来吗？
Jane, can you come?

113
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,640
我不能，彼得。
I can't, Peter.

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
他们无处不在。来吧，请。
They're everywhere. Just come, please.

115
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,920
是你对他做的吗？
Did you do that to him?

116
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,120
是的。科林知道你是谁，维维安。
Yes. Colin knows who you are, Vivien.

117
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,400
你和那个克莱因男孩。他在《纪事报》上看到了。
You and the Klein boy. He saw it in the Chronicle.

118
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,638
杰里米？你的订婚公告被印在了报纸上。
Jeremy? Your engagement announcement was printed in the paper.

119
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,038
乔丹把它放在他的书房里。我在烧掉总部之前看到了它
Jordan had it in his study. I saw it before we torched HQ.

120
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,918
他知道。
He knows.

121
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,558
该你了，我的爱人。我很抱歉。他们得到了所有的犹太报纸。
You're up, my love. I'm sorry. They get all the Jewish papers,

122
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,438
杰克，这并不意味着他读了它。这并不意味着... 他在耍你！
Jack, that doesn't mean he read it. That doesn't mean... He's played ya!

123
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,598
他耍了你。别这么说。你为什么不听我的话？
He's played ya. Don't say that. Why didn't you follow my lead?

124
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,998
我是想把你弄出来。我想和你谈谈。
I was trying to get you out. I was trying to talk to you.

125
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,678
你为什么不听我说？我为什么不听你的？
Why didn't you listen to me? Why didn't I listen to you?

126
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,718
你，一个撒谎和消失的人
You, who lies and disappears

127
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,278
让我不得不来找你。
and gets so stuck I have to come and find you,

128
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,558
你把一个男孩打得遍体鳞伤，一旦他醒来，他的身份就会被揭穿。
who beats a boy so badly his cover will be blown

129
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,038
在他醒来的那一刻，他的身份就会暴露。我已经找到了我们需要的东西，让他被关起来。

130
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,920
我牺牲了。

131
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,718
我做了该做的事。
I did what needed to be done.

132
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,918
听我说。听着。无论你昨晚让他对你做什么，
Listen to me. Listen. Whatever you let him do to you last night,

133
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,518
我原谅你，好吗？我可以原谅你...
I forgive you, all right? I can forgive you...

134
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,398
我不是在请求你的原谅，杰克。
I'm not asking for your forgiveness, Jack.

135
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,358
我没有要求什么。

你现在需要听从我的领导。
You need to follow my lead now.

137
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,798
我告诉你，我在一个手提箱里找到了我们需要的所有东西 --
I'm telling you, I found everything we need in a suitcase -

138
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,478
武器发票，会员档案，银行转账，所有的东西。
arms invoices, membership files, bank transfers, everything.

139
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,000
我不能让你回去。我要回去了。他们会杀了你的。
I can't let you go back. I'm going back. They'll kill you.

140
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
他走了吗？他就来了。
Has he gone? He's coming.

141
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,320
不应该让他走。他要来了！好了吗？
Shouldn't have let him go. HE'S COMING! ALL RIGHT?!

142
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
该死的。该死的！
Dammit. Dammit!

143
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,838
你什么时候能玩？快了。
When can you play? Soon.

144
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,080
什么时候吃午饭？我想知道你父亲把那个箱子放在哪里。
When is lunch? I wonder where your father put that suitcase.

145
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,720
保罗？
Paul?

146
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,998
保罗，我在和你说话。什么事？
Paul, I'm talking to you. Yes?

147
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,958
你知道你父亲把那个旧皮箱放在哪里吗？
Do you know where your father put that old suitcase?

148
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,798
不喜欢醋栗。为什么所有的东西都有醋栗呢？
Don't like currants. Why does everything have currants in it?

149
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,480
我知道，我有一个很好的游戏。
I know, I have a great game.

150
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,240
彼得！
Peter!

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,240
找到彼得！
Find Peter!

152
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,038
如果我没有被起诉，我需要被释放。
If I'm not being charged I need to be released.

153
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,160
请解开你的长裤。

154
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
你想被限制住吗？
Do you want to be restrained?

155
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,120
坚持住。
Hang on.

156
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,560
早上好。早上好。

157
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,400
有薇薇安的消息吗？还没有。
Any word from Vivien? Not yet.

158
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,118
早上好，拉比。早。

159
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,880
索里在哪里？
Where's Soly?

160
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,680
他在哪里？
Where is he?

161
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,360
没人知道。钱不见了。
No-one knows. The money's gone.

162
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,040
他不会的。
He wouldn't have.

163
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,360
我女儿呢？
Where's my daughter?

164
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,918
哦。莉莎。不要告诉我谎言，南希。
Oh. Liza. Tell me no lies, Nancy.

165
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,360
我们进去吧。快点。
Let's get inside. Quickly.

166
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,678
民主是现代最大的骗局。
Democracy is the greatest deception of the modern age.

167
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,838
犹太人是飙升的移民率的幕后推手。
The Jews are behind the soaring immigration rates,

168
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,958
破坏了我们的市场力量的稳定，无休止的战争，
the destabilising of our market forces, endless wars,

169
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,758
不可饶恕的贫穷。我明白。
unforgivable poverty. I understand,

170
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,278
但你将如何做到这一点，先生？这似乎是不可逾越的。
but how will you do this, sir? It seems so insurmountable.

171
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,238
我们怎么能阻止这一切？
How can we stop this?

172
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,558
我很抱歉，莉莎。
I'm sorry, Liza.

173
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,838
我知道这很难让人接受。
I know it's a lot to take in.

174
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,720
你想再喝杯茶吗？请吧。
Would you like another cup of tea? Please.

175
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,558
我可以...吗？
Can I...?

176
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,800
我可以... ...把事情弄清楚吗？因为我不是...
Can I... just get this right? Cos I'm not...

177
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,678
我的丈夫...

178
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,398
...是一个文件伪造者
..is a documentation forger

179
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,080
为我哥哥经营的一个地下组织伪造文件。

180
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,918
还有我的小女儿，我的心肝宝贝。
And my youngest daughter, the apple of my eye,

181
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,278
敲开了你的门--
knocked on your door -

182
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,078
从未去过曼彻斯特的她
having never been of Manchester -

183
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,318
在短短的几天内，什么，几天？-
and in a matter of - what, a couple of days? -

184
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,838
你让她漂白了头发，采用了一个化名
You had her bleach her hair, adopt an alias

185
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,798
并派她去和一个十足的希特勒门徒打交道。
and sent her in to schmooze a full-blown Hitler disciple.

186
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,600
我说的对吗？
Have I got that right?

187
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,560
是的，这就对了。
Yeah, that's right.

188
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,120
南希。
Nancy.

189
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,998
你还记得你把你的罗尼送到我这里的时候吗？
Do you remember when you sent your Ronnie up to me,

190
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,918
那次你母亲生病了？
that time that your mother was ill?

191
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,398
是的，我记得。你还记得我把他带到哪里吗？
Yes, I do. Do you remember where I took him?

192
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,958
火车博物馆。
The train museum.

193
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,278
你说什么？去火车博物馆。
Beg your pardon? To the train museum.

194
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,360
火车博物馆。是的，南希。
The train museum. That's right, Nancy.

195
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,518
我们看了看那些老蒸汽机。
We had a look at the old steamers.

196
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,038
给他买了个铅笔盒。
Bought him a pencil case.

197
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,318
事后，我们去了里昂茶馆，吃了一个可爱的奶油蛋糕。
And afterwards, we went to Lyons Tea House and had a lovely cream cake.

198
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,878
你看到区别了吗？
Do you see the difference?

199
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,840
莉莎，拜托，我...
Liza, please, I...

200
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,598
你用一点重碳酸盐就能把它弄掉。
You'll get that off with a little bicarb.

201
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,080
现在，告诉我，我弟弟在哪里，南希。
Now, tell me where my brother is, Nancy.

202
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,440
我得打一个电话。
I've got to make a phone call.

203
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,758
我知道我的权利。

204
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,958
是的，是的，是的，索里，你去吧。

205
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,838
你好。
Hiya.

206
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,920
嗳！
Oi!

207
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,118
如果你不打算起诉我，你需要释放我。
If you're not going to charge me, you need to release me.

208
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,118
已经超过24小时了。要花多少时间就花多少时间。
It's been over 24 hours. It'll take as long as it takes.

209
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,758
特别是你的文书工作的状况。
Especially the state of your paperwork.

210
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,560
又改了地址？是的。
Changed address again? Yes.

211
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,878
这次又是什么？只是你的普通的骚扰行为。
What was it this time? Just your bog-standard harassment.

212
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,998
不是说你们这些人做了什么。你知道，如果我是你，我会改变
Not that you lot did anything about it. You know, I'd change

213
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,758
这种态度，如果我是你。
that attitude, if I were you.

214
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,918
严重的身体伤害是一种严重的罪行。
Grievous bodily harm is a serious offence.

215
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,838
洛克威尔先生是一位受人尊敬的美国政治家，我被告知。
Mr Rockwell is a respected American politician, I'm told.

216
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,318
那会传递出什么样的信息？
What kind of message does that send out?

217
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,678
我没有碰他，警官。我不需要。
I didn't touch him, Officer. I didn't need to.

218
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,558
他很害怕，这个愚蠢的纳粹自己摔了个狗吃屎。
He was so scared, the stupid Nazi fell on his arse all by himself.

219
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,720
他摔得很惨，就在他的屁股上。
He fell smack bang right on his arse.

220
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,838
他自己摔倒在屁股上了！
He fell on his arse all by himself!

221
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,198
混血儿！半种姓的孩子！
Oi! Half-caste! Half-caste boy!

222
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,800
哦，滚蛋吧，伙计。
Oh, sod off, mate.

223
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,958
那么我们找到箱子后会赢得什么？
So what do we win when we find the suitcase?

224
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,198
哦，一些非常，非常...
Oh, something very, very...

225
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,998
我能说句话吗，简？
Could I have a word, Jane?

226
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,320
我们正在进行一个游戏。
We're in the middle of a game.

227
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,078
什么事？
What is it?

228
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,078
伊利斯非常苦恼。
Elise was very distressed.

229
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,358
看着一个孕妇处于这样的状态是很难受的，你不觉得吗？
It's hard to watch a pregnant woman in such a state, don't you think?

230
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,880
嗯...
Well...

231
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,160
...他们希望在你的子嗣中获得更大的份额。
..they're expecting a greater share in your subs.

232
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,040
他们在你背后说得很清楚。
They made that very clear behind your back.

233
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,400
这是事实吗？
Is that a fact?

234
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,358
是的。李没有停止关于得到他的房子的行动。
Yes. Lee didn't stop going on about getting his house.

235
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,038
得到他的房子，然后退出，我想这就是计划。
Getting his house and calling it quits, I think that plan was.

236
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,880
我想，我们都有自己参与运动的理由。
We all have our reasons for getting involved in the movement, I suppose.

237
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,360
的确是这样。
Indeed we do.

238
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,558
她说她在一家沙龙里看到了你的外套。
She said she saw your coat in a salon.

239
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,438
那件有蝴蝶补丁的衣服很特别。
The distinctive one with the butterfly patch.

240
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,318
他们在那里从未听说过你。
They'd never heard of you there.

241
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,558
说是属于一个叫维维安-埃文斯的人。
Said it belonged to a Vivien Evans.

242
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,758
所有的美发师都是朋友。
All the hairdressers are friends.

243
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,040
我很了解维维安-埃文斯。

244
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,998
她很喜欢我的大衣，想买个配套的蝴蝶贴。
She loved my coat and wanted to get a matching butterfly patch,

245
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,680
所以我... 我给了她一个。
so I... I gave her one.

246
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,080
也许是你爸爸教你缝纫的。
Perhaps your dad taught you to sew.

247
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,760
你爸爸，那个邮递员。
Your dad, the postman.

248
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,480
或者你的爸爸，那个犹太裁缝。

249
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,960
我知道你是什么人。
I know what you are.

250
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,240
你对我一点都不了解。
You don't know anything about me.

251
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,520
你是个妓女。
You're a whore.

252
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,760
快起来。现在就起来。
Get up. Get up now.

253
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,758
我做不到。我很抱歉。
I can't. I'm sorry.

254
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,358
你知道... 你把我带到你的床上。
You knew... and you took me to your bed.

255
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,160
我当然知道。
Of course I knew.

256
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,718
我在里德利路游行前就知道了。
I knew before the Ridley Road march.

257
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,160
看着你走到那个犹太教堂，假装... ...
Watching you walk to that synagogue, pretending...

258
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,518
虽然我确实想知道你的感受，真的，在内心深处。
Though I do wonder how you felt, really, deep down.

259
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,558
我想知道你的一部分是否想成为我们中的一员。
I wonder if part of you wanted to be one of us.

260
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,680
在这样的力量和勇气中行走。
To walk among such strength and bravery.

261
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,280
我想，这与你那可悲的部落形成了鲜明的对比。
A stark contrast to your wretched tribe, I would imagine.

262
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,800
起床了!
Get up!

263
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,560
帮帮我！
Help me!

264
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,640
他在这里！我找到他了！
He's here! I found him!

265
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,598
保罗？保罗？保罗！
Paul? Paul? Paul!

266
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,160
保罗，你在哪里？
Paul, where are you?

267
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,600
告诉我你在哪里。保罗？
Tell me where you are. Paul?

268
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,560
保罗？
Paul?

269
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,560
抓到你了。
Caught you.

270
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,918
你拿着行李箱吗？
Have you got the suitcase?

271
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,520
我真的需要它，亲爱的。快一点。
I really need it, darling. Quickly.

272
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,000
把它给我，亲爱的。
Give it to me, darling.

273
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,798
如果我给你这个，你就会离开我，是吗？
If I give you this, you'll leave me, won't you?

274
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,520
哦，可怜的，可爱的孩子。
Oh, poor, sweet boy.

275
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,960
愿上帝保佑你。
May God bless you.

276
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
保守你。
And keep you.

277
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,800
让他的光照耀着你。
And shine His light on you.

278
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,800
并对你有恩典。
And be gracious to you.

279
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,640
愿他转向你...
May He turn towards you...

280
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,000
...并赐予你平安。
..and grant you peace.

281
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,440
谢谢你，亲爱的。
Thank you, darling.

282
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,918
保罗？
Paul?

283
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,158
不要那样做。
Don't do that.

284
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,840
求你了!
Please!

285
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,840
杰克。杰克！
Jack. Jack!

286
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,240
回到这里来。
Get back in here.

287
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,760
不，不！
No. No!

288
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,558
喂，混血儿！滚开！
Oi, half-caste boy! Sod off!

289
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,278
去吧，滚开，我说。
Go on, sod off, I said.

290
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,238
听着。我得告诉你一件事。
Listen. I gotta tell you something.

291
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,078
到里德利路去！闭嘴，犹太佬，我警告你！
Go to Ridley Road! Shut it, Yid, I'm warning ya!

292
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,238
闭嘴！别来烦我。
Shut up! Leave me alone.

293
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,478
他有个消息给你。
He's got a message for ya.

294
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,118
你要告诉他吗？雷德利路。
Are you telling him? Ridley Road.

295
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,318
他在说什么？他说，到里德利路去。
What's he saying? He says, get to Ridley Road.

296
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,518
你和我的侄女一起工作。他们撮合了我们。科林-乔丹...
You worked with my niece. They set us up. Colin Jordan...

297
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,478
我们的侄女薇薇安，她和他们在一起，我们无法联系到她。
Our niece Vivien, she's in with them, and we can't get hold of her.

298
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,638
你去... 够了！把管子放下。
You go to... That's enough! Pipe down.

299
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,320
你明白吗？
You got that?!

300
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,240
啊！
Ah!

301
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,760
啊。啊。
Ah. Ah.

302
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,280
继续前进！
Keep moving!

303
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,160
呃！
Uh!

304
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,360
呃！
Uh!

305
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,160
你被释放了。
You're released.

306
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,600
把毯子捡起来。
Pick the blanket up.

307
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,320
全部完成。
All finished.

308
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,758
你总是擅自做主。这越来越荒唐了。
You've always taken liberties. This is getting ridiculous.

309
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,398
你为什么要惩罚我？我不想惩罚你。
Why are you trying to punish me? I don't want to punish you.

310
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,398
我已经失去了一切。我已经失去了我的家庭，我的名字，我的女儿。
I've lost everything. I've lost my family, my name, my daughter.

311
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,238
求你了, Liza... 如果他们碰她的一根头发，
Please, Liza... If they touch a hair on her head,

312
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,718
我向上帝发誓，我将... 我会毁了你。
I swear to God, I will... I'll destroy you.

313
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,638
Liza, Liza, Liza. 你到底是谁？
Liza, Liza, Liza. Who the hell are you?

314
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,358
没事了。没事的，莉莎，我认识他。我认识他。
It's all right. It's all right, Liza, I know him. I know him.

315
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,998
他是沙龙的人。怎么了，孩子？
He's from the salon. What is it, son?

316
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,038
索里。索尔怎么样了?
Soly. What about Sol?

317
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,038
他被国家安全局的人缝起来了 什么? 他们昨天晚上进来了
He's been stitched up by the NSM. What? They got in here last night

318
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,518
他们陷害了他。他现在被拘留了
and they framed him. He's in custody now.

319
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,438
索里让我来警告你。他说他们会回来的。
Soly sent me to warn you. He says they will come back.

320
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,038
你要尽快离开这里。
You need to get out of here fast.

321
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,798
就这样吧。儿子... Stevie? 是史蒂文，对吗？
That's all. Son... Stevie? It is Stevie, isn't it?

322
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,680
等等，等一下。
Wait. Hold up.

323
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,800
他还好吗？
Is he all right?

324
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,478
她并不是说... 她不是怕你。
She didn't mean... She wasn't scared of you.

325
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,878
你今天冒着生命危险来这里。谢谢你。
You risked your neck coming here today. Thank you.

326
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,558
说到底，我们都是一样的，不是吗？
At the end of the day we're all the same, ain't we?

327
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,120
不，我们并不完全一样。
No, we're not quite the same.

328
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,360
但也许...
But maybe...

329
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,278
...我们在为同一场战斗而战。
..we're fighting the same fight.

330
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,800
是的。也许我们是。
Yeah. Maybe we are.

331
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,758
如果薇薇安成功了，你会让我知道的，是吗？
You'll let me know if Vivien makes it, won't you?

332
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,480
别等了。快离开这里。
Don't wait around. Get out of here.

333
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,678
有机会搭车去车站吗？
Any chance of a lift to the station?

334
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,880
我上班要迟到了。
I'm late for work.

335
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,960
上车吧。我看看能不能赶上半点。非常感谢你。
Get in. I'll see if I can make the half past. Thank you so much.

336
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,400
杰夫。
Jeff.

337
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,758
帮帮我。
Help me.

338
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,958
请不要让他们杀了我。
Please don't let them kill me.

339
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,440
你把我当成什么人了？我求你了。
What kind of mug do you take me for? I'm begging ya.

340
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,878
让我打开这扇门。你欺骗了我们。
Just let me open this door. You deceived us.

341
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,800
你应该得到应有的报应。
You deserve what's coming to ya.

342
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,518
你不需要他们。
You don't need them.

343
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,838
你不需要他们。我了解你。
You don't need 'em. I know you.

344
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,200
我知道你经历了什么。闭上你的嘴！
I know what you've been through. Shut your trap!

345
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,838
我知道你所过的生活。
I know the life you've lived.

346
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,198
被所有应该关心你的人辜负了。
Let down by everyone who should have cared for ya.

347
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,038
你自己的母亲破坏了你的信任。
Your own mother broke your trust.

348
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,200
你认为这个世界是腐朽的，是来抓你的。
You think the world's rotten, out to get ya.

349
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,758
以你的手艺，你是对的。
With the hand you've been dealt, you'd be right.

350
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,238
你应该对这个世界感到愤怒，当然你应该，但是... ...
You should be furious with the world, course you should, but...

351
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,798
...你不能认为乔丹就是答案。
..you can't think Jordan's the answer.

352
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,478
我会告诉他你在说什么。我会告诉他。
I'll tell him what you're saying. I'll tell him.

353
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,758
你完蛋了，伙计。你完蛋了。他在利用你。
You're done for, mate. You're finished. He's using ya.

354
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,478
你认为他为什么从不弄脏自己的手？
Why do you think he never gets his hands dirty?

355
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,118
他把你当做一个杯子。他不相信他的运气。
He's taking you for a mug. He can't believe his luck.

356
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,200
他在嘲笑你，杰夫。
He's laughing at ya, Jeff.

357
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,918
把车停下来。让我出去。
Stop the van. And let me out.

358
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,400
我相信你。
I believe in you.

359
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,520
你可以做到这一点。让我出去。
You can do this. Let me out.

360
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,520
杰夫！不！
Jeff! No!

361
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,558
呆在你的座位上。不要让一个场景。
Stay in your seat. Don't make a scene.

362
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,400
我会告诉你这是怎么一回事的。
I'll talk you through how this is going to play out.

363
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,638
要茶吗？不，谢谢你。
Tea? No, thank you.

364
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,880
茶？
Tea?

365
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,480
小姐？小姐？你说什么？
Miss? Miss? Excuse me?

366
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,038
你要告诉我是谁让你这样做的。
You're going to tell me who put you up to it.

367
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,398
你要告诉我你知道的一切。彼得在哪里？
You're going to tell me everything you know. Where's Peter?

368
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,200
你把他带到哪里去了？
Where did you take him?

369
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,238
我想那段小小的恋情现在已经结束了。
I think that little love affair is as good as over now,

370
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,160
现在你已经是受损的货物了。
now that you're damaged goods.

371
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,318
你们这种人有个特殊的地方，你知道的。
There's a special place for your kind, you know.

372
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,278
他们用墨水给你做了标记--Feldhure，野战妓女，横在胸前。
They marked you in ink - Feldhure, field whore, across the chest,

373
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,758
放在一个房间里，供士兵们下班后享用。
kept in a room for the soldiers to enjoy after hours.

374
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,878
甚至其他囚犯也会在集中营里向你吐口水。
Even the other inmates would spit at you in the camps.

375
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
对你们来说，这一切都结束了。
It's over for all of you.

376
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,080
我想你认为我是站在历史的错误一边的人。
I suppose you think I'm the one on the wrong side of history.

377
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,118
这对你来说很重要，不是吗？
That's got to you, hasn't it?

378
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,158
你们这些人的问题，是否认的问题。
The trouble with you lot, it's the denial.

379
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,238
看看周围。
Look around.

380
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,958
我们无处不在。
We are everywhere.

381
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,478
我们坐在这节车厢里。
We're sitting in this carriage.

382
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,478
我们在下议院里投票。
We're voting in the House of Commons.

383
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,678
我们在工厂里工作，在田间劳作。
We're working in the factories and toiling in the fields.

384
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,998
我们越来越接近
We are getting closer

385
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,918
越来越接近我们分娩的时刻。
and closer to our moment of delivery.

386
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,358
女士们，先生们，我需要你们的关注，请。
Ladies and gentlemen, I need your attention, please.

387
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,038
我现在处境非常危险。
I am in great danger.

388
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,318
坐在我旁边的这个男人不是我的丈夫。他想伤害我
This man sitting next to me is not my husband. He wants to hurt me

389
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,198
我需要一些帮助。亲爱的，请坐下。
and I need some assistance. Darling, do sit down.

390
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,838
求你了。求你了，难道没有人帮助我吗？请原谅我的妻子。
Please. Please, won't someone help me? Excuse my wife.

391
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,838
她感觉不舒服。不，请，请。
She's not feeling well. No, please, please.

392
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,040
下去吧，亲爱的。求你了！求你了！求你了！
Down you go, dear. Please! Please! Please!

393
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,080
求你了？
Please?

394
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,640
一定是失去了你的感觉。
Must be losing your touch.

395
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,798
女士们，先生们。
Ladies and gentlemen,

396
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,678
火车现在的终点站是拉什福德路。
the train now terminates at Rushford Road.

397
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,558
所有变化，所有变化。即将进入拉什福德路。
All change, all change. Coming into Rushford Road.

398
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,240
女士们先生们，列车在此终点站。
Train terminates here, ladies and gentlemen.

399
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,000
请原谅我。
Excuse me.

400
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,160
你忘了这个。
You forgot this.

401
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,160
太感谢了。
Thank you so much.

402
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,160
你能想象一下，如果我干涉了你的家庭？
Can you for a moment imagine if I'd interloped your family?

403
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,398
如果我是那个撒谎、欺骗的人？
If I had been the one to lie, to deceive?

404
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,158
你能想象吗，维维安？
Could you imagine, Vivien?

405
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,518
你当然不能，因为这个世界上唯一被允许的受害者
Of course you can't, because the only victims that are allowed

406
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,000
在这个世界上存在的唯一受害者就是你。
to exist in this world are you.

407
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,038
我所做的一切
All I am doing

408
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,920
是在保护我的儿子。
is protecting my son.

409
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,638
所有这些都是为了他。
All of this is for him.

410
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,478
我所做的一切是为了给他
Everything I do is to give him

411
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,718
一个更好的机会，一个更好的世界。
a better chance, a better world,

412
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,078
一个更公平的世界。
a fairer world.

413
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,920
就这么简单。
It's as simple as that.

414
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,758
你打算怎么做？
What did you intend to do?

415
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,000
让我的孩子反对我，拆散我的家庭？
Turn my child against me, break up my family?

416
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,560
没有必要。它已经破碎了。
There's no need. It's already broken.

417
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,000
如果你保持沉默，你就有机会了。
If you keep quiet, you have a chance.

418
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,118
不，不。我的伙计们都很忠诚。
No, no. Loyal to a fault, my lads are.

419
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,918
只要我说一句话，就不知道他们会对你做什么。
One word from me and there's no telling what they might do to you.

420
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,520
我们不希望这样，是吗？救命啊！
We don't want that, do we? Help!

421
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,200
啊！
Ah!

422
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,240
追上她！快走！
Get after her! Go!

423
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,158
你能把我藏起来吗？
Can you please hide me?

424
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,200
哦！
Oh!

425
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,640
婊子！
Bitch!

426
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
把它从她身上拿开！
Get it off her!

427
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,320
不，把她的手拿开。
No! Get her hands off it.

428
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,880
喂，别管她！
Oi, leave her alone!

429
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,320
把你的手从我身上拿开！
Get your hands off me!

430
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,400
这是我的国家！
This is my country!

431
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,678
这是我的国家！
This is my country!

432
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,480
请把我带到里德利路。来吧，亲爱的，跳进去。
Take me to Ridley Road, please. Go on, love, jump in.

433
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,640
哦。薇薇安。
Oh. Vivien.

434
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,040
杰克...
Jack...

435
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,360
...他在哪里？
..where is he?

436
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,240
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

437
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,638
你可以进去了，但她还没有离开床。没事的。
You can go in but she hasn't left the bed. It's all right,

438
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,160
我知道，我知道。可怜的女孩。我来处理吧。交给我吧。
I know, I know. Poor girl. I'll handle it. Leave it to me.

439
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,798
薇薇安？
Vivien?

440
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,638
薇薇安，亲爱的，有人来找你了。
Vivien, love, there's someone here to see you.

441
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,918
你好，我的爱人。只有我。
Hello, my love. Only me.

442
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,920
我完全知道你需要什么。
I know exactly what you need.

443
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,280
好点了吗？
Better?

444
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,278
好多了。
Much better.

445
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,560
更加... ... 有品位。谢谢你，芭芭拉。
More... classy. Thank you, Barbara.

446
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,398
你站在天使的正确一边，我的爱人。
You're on the right side of the angels, my love.

447
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,960
但你的包是一个绝对的耻辱。
But your bags are an absolute disgrace.

448
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,360
等一下。请你拿着那个，爱泼斯坦夫人？
One sec. Could you hold that, please, Mrs Epstein?

449
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,480
薇薇安，我们要把你打扮得漂漂亮亮的。
Vivien, we're going to fix you up good and proper.

450
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,798
...等着他。是的，但要等他来，然后你就知道了。
..Wait for him. Yes, but wait for him and then you'll know,

451
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,198
他会告诉你该怎么做。听你妈妈的话。因为这很有意义。
he'll tell you what to do. Listen to your mum. Because it makes sense.

452
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,158
为了把这个血淋淋的案子弄出来，我已经走到了地狱的深处。
I've been to the depths of hell to get this bloody case out.

453
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,238
薇薇安，语言。我一秒钟都不想再等了。
Vivien, language. I'm not waiting a second longer.

454
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,878
薇薇安，请。
Vivien, please.

455
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,840
谢谢你，琼斯夫人。他们在这里吗？是的。怎么样？爸爸？
Thank you, Mrs Jones. Are they in 'ere? Yes. Well? Daddy?

456
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,118
他们会看到她的。哦，我的神经。
They'll see her. Oh, my nerves.

457
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,398
呃，他的名字是麦克克拉肯侦探。
Er, and his name's Detective MacCracken.

458
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,798
呃，我听说他在特别部门工作，所以他会参加会议的。
Er, I'm told he works in Special Branch, so he'll take the meeting.

459
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,678
哦，薇薇安。她怎么做，大卫，她会马上去吗？
Oh, Vivien. Well, what does she do, David, does she go right away?

460
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,558
好吧，她不能自己去。 我可以，爸爸，我当然可以。我可以，爸爸，我当然可以。
Well, she can't go on her own. I can, Daddy, of course I can.

461
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,158
如果他们扣押证据或以非法侵入的名义逮捕你...
If they seize the evidence or arrest you for trespassing...

462
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,598
这次就不一样了。
It'll be different this time.

463
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,878
我们不能让你自己去。
We can't afford to let you go on your own.

464
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,038
如果我可以的话，我会带她去，但是... 我有前科。
I would take her if I could but... I have a record.

465
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,838
哦！这只是小事，但......这将危及一切。
Oh! It's only minor but... it would jeopardise everything.

466
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,640
会毁了她所有的巨大工作。
It would ruin all her tremendous work.

467
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,160
我去吧。我和你一起去，维维安。
I'll go. I'll go with you, Vivien.

468
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,638
好吗，姐姐？已经有一段时间了。
All right, sis? It's been a while.

469
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,478
他们又把你放出来了，是吗？是的，你知道我 --
They let you out again, then, did they? Yeah, you know me -

470
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,158
我有朋友，欠了人情。
I've got friends, owed favours.

471
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,360
就像孩子们说的那样，这一切都很有趣。
It's all groovy, as the kids say.

472
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,158
下午好，琼斯太太。
Afternoon, Mrs Jones.

473
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,878
伯恩斯先生。恐怕我现在不接待访客。
Mr Burns. I'm afraid I'm not receiving visitors presently.

474
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,198
哦，对不起。我只是路过而已。
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just passing.

475
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,718
只是我们在会议上错过了你。
Only we've missed you at the meeting.

476
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,518
艾瑟尔的维多利亚海绵不那么有弹性了。
Ethel's Victoria sponge isn't quite as bouncy.

477
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,118
我只是想确定你没事，就这样。
Wanted to make sure you were all right, that's all.

478
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,598
非常好，伯恩斯先生。嗯，就像一个人可以做的那样好
Quite all right, Mr Burns. Well, as all right as one can be

479
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,958
遇到这么多麻烦
with all the troubles that are going on.

480
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,038
哦，对不起，我不知道你有客人。
Oh, pardon me, I didn't know you had guests.

481
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,118
我们正在举行葬礼。什么--瓦？丧礼。
We're sitting a shiva. A what-va? A shiva.

482
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,438
为那位失去生命的年轻先生。
For the young gentleman who lost his life.

483
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,680
这是一个犹太习俗。
It's a Jewish custom.

484
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,358
对。好吧，我会在更方便的时候回来的。
Right. Well, I'll pop back at a more convenient time.

485
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,318
实际上，伯恩斯先生，如果你不介意的话，
Actually, Mr Burns, if you wouldn't mind,

486
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,600
你就别管它了
you can just sod off out of it.

487
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,918
请原谅，琼斯夫人？
Beg pardon, Mrs Jones?

488
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,518
我在战争中失去了三个儿子。
I lost three boys during the war,

489
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,398
我在战争中失去了三个儿子，因为要对抗像你这样邪恶的小丑。
fighting off vicious buffoons like you.

490
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,838
在我让历史重演之前，我已经在地下冷了很久了。
I'll be long cold in the ground before I let history repeat itself.

491
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,318
所以，如果你不介意的话，伯恩斯先生，跳下去吧。
So if you wouldn't mind taking a running jump, Mr Burns.

492
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,640
消失吧！坦率地说，在地狱里腐烂吧！
Clear off! And, quite frankly, rot in hell!

493
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,438
我又要上厕所了。你就憋着吧。
I need the toilet again. Just hold it in.

494
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,798
我已经有四个孩子了，维维安，我憋不住了。
I've had four children, Vivien, I can't hold it in.

495
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,678
麦克克拉肯探长。

你好。爱泼斯坦小姐。爱泼斯坦夫人。

497
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,998
我可以重申一下我的哀悼吗？
May I please reiterate my condolences?

498
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,078
我们试图取得关于杰克-莫里斯的证词，
We tried to get statements about Jack Morris,

499
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,638
但没有人愿意和我们交谈。
but no-one will talk to us.

500
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,478
我认为社区已经对这个系统失去了信心。
I think the community have lost all faith in the system,

501
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,438
说实话。
