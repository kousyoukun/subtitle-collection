Darren.

14
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,559
First lead on a murder case.

15
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,439
SHE SIGHS
Bit early.

16
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,719
Jesse Halpin. Sheep farmer.
Right.

17
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,359
This is his place.

18
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,959
Someone shot him last night.
He was walking home from the pub.

19
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,479
It's a bit out of the way,
these woods.

20
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,279
There's a footpath from the village.
Leads straight across his land.

21
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,319
Up through those trees
to the farmhouse.

22
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,680
Who called it in?
Farm worker.

23
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,639
Lorna Spalden.
She's given us a statement.

24
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,079
I still need to speak to her, yeah.

25
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,160
I'm gonna check in
with Dr Newstone first.

26
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,319
Dr Newstone.

27
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,439
Shotgun wounds to the upper torso.

28
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,559
No soot staining
or secondary projectile damage.

29
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,079
Any sign of a firearm?

30
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,079
Nothing yet.

31
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,079
What about these shoe treads?

32
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,839
We've ruled them out
as the victim's.

33
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,959
It's a public footpath.

34
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,559
Any number of people
will have traipsed all over it.

35
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,439
We'll get them photographed.

36
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,639
But we did find
some expended shell cases.

37
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,440
If we're lucky,
we might lift some latent prints.

38
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,879
So, whoever shot him
was standing here.

39
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,599
So he either chanced upon
his killer,

40
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,879
or someone was lying in wait.

41
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,200
That's a reasonably accurate
assessment.

42
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,320
This is hardly the time,
but well done with that promotion.

43
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
Thanks.

44
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,880
Ambitious new DI
with a point to prove.

45
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,640
Pretty much sums it up.

46
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,479
Ridley never let himself get carried
away with theories and guess work.

47
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,199
Well, Ridley isn't running
this case.

48
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,040
I'm not saying he was always right.

49
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,279
Play to your strengths.

50
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,680
You'll get there.

51
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,520
HE GRUNTS

52
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,240
SOFTLY: Oh, Jesus...

53
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,919
So, this is where
you've been hiding?

54
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,960
Jean.

55
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,000
What are you doing out here?
Oh, I've come to see you.

56
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,999
Can I come in?

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,319
Place is a bit of a mess.

58
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,560
I'll get my boots on,
we'll go for a walk.

59
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,119
Lorna, isn't it? DI Carol Farman.
Copelton Police.

60
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I understand
that you found the body?

61
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,520
Yeah, he was lying by the footpath.

62
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,679
Must've been there all night.

63
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,559
Do you always walk to work
along the footpath?

64
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,599
I've a place
down by Wensbeck Bridge.

65
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,519
Live-in tenant.

66
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,840
Edge of the woods?
That's right.

67
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,800
So, erm, how long have you
worked for the Halpins?

68
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,759
Must be 20-odd years now.

69
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,360
You'd have known Jesse Halpin
pretty well, then?

70
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,080
Well enough.

71
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,999
Is there anyone you can think of
that might have fallen out with him?

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,680
Well, people round here....

73
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,719
..they never had
a good word to say about Jesse.

74
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,800
Any of those people
I should be talking to?

75
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,000
Halpins keep themselves
to themselves.

76
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,240
It's just the way it's always been.
Hmm.

77
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,680
I'll let you get on.

78
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,239
How's your retirement shaping up?

79
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,079
Well, you know,
takes a bit of getting used to,

80
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,839
all this time on your hands.

81
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,999
Well, you cut adrift in your prime.

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,320
You've still got so much to offer.

83
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,559
"Access to pension
on medical grounds"

84
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
was the phrase
they used to dress it up.

85
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,999
Well, I used to run
a Major Crimes team.

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,439
And these days, the school run
is about as exciting as it gets. Ha!

87
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,680
The grandkids.

88
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,280
You gotta enjoy that.

89
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,319
Do you know, if I'm honest,
they make me feel old.

90
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,440
You miss it then. The job?

91
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,600
So much more than I thought I would.

92
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,560
Your presence was noted
at the funeral.

93
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,960
I should have come earlier, but...

94
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,679
To be honest,
I didn't know what to say to you.

95
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,040
Nothing anybody can say.

96
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,840
Won't bring them back.

97
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,879
He went to the pub after tea.

98
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,399
And that's The Mason's Arms
in Wensbeck?

99
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,759
20-minute walk
if you cut across the fields.

100
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,279
And when he didn't come home,
you rang the police?

101
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,639
He wasn't answering his mobile.

102
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,839
What time was this?

103
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,519
Must have been well after midnight.

104
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,279
And you were both here all evening?

105
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,519
We don't get out much.
The farm keeps us busy.

106
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,199
Mm.

107
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,360
You own most of the land
around the village.

108
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,719
Just shy of 300 acres.
Sheep farming, mainly.

109
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,119
I'm sorry to have to ask you this,
Mrs Halpin,

110
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,999
but, erm, is there anybody

111
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,520
who might have had a grievance
with your husband?

112
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,080
No-one I can think of.

113
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,000
The chances are
this wasn't a random shooting.

114
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,360
Well, we keep our own company.
Always have done.

115
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,439
Your tenant, Lorna Spalden,
hinted that there was tensions.

116
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,760
Neighbours in the village.

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,880
Best pay no heed to what Lorna says.

118
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,119
How long will they be out there
in the woods?

119
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,599
We've locked off the area
as a murder scene.

120
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,280
Crime Scene Investigators
are searching for evidence.

121
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,799
She's been up all night.
She's exhausted.

122
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,359
I understand.

123
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,599
We'll still need you
to identify your husband's body.

124
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,000
There's no rush.

125
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,199
I can speak
to a family liaison officer?

126
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,080
No, no. No need for any of that.

127
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,120
I'll see she's looked after.

128
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,160
Thank you.

129
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,279
You heard from
Carol Farman lately?

130
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,879
Carol. Yeah.

131
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,159
No, I suspect she's busy. You know,
with the promotion and that.

132
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,359
So you won't have heard about
last night's homicide?

133
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,040
Sheep farmer right in Wensbeck.
Jesse Halpin.

134
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,200
I thought it would be better
if you heard it from me.

135
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,039
Have they any idea who killed him?

136
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,479
Well, that's a question for the SIO.

137
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,440
So this wasn't a social call, Jean.

138
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,680
You came all the way out here what,
to warn me off, is that it?

139
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,480
It's just some friendly advice,
that's all.

140
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,479
From one ex-copper to another.

141
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,479
You can't solve them all, Ridley.

142
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,800
It doesn't pay to dwell on the past.

143
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,840
See you later.

144
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,439
Adless Woods homicide.
Victim's name was Jesse Halpin.

145
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,279
He's a sheep farmer from Wensbeck.

146
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,799
Last seen drinking
in The Mason's Arms in the village.

147
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,959
It appears
he was killed on the walk back home.

148
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,679
Fatal shotgun wound to the chest.

149
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,679
Body was discovered by Lorna Spalden
- one of his tenants.

150
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,959
Any names in the mix?
No-one so far.

151
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,999
It does seem that
the Halpins have a bit of a rep.

152
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,439
Chances are this was personal.
Someone with a grudge.

153
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,159
Someone local who knew the area.

154
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,359
So let's get some legs
over to Wensbeck.

155
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,079
I want house-to-house inquiries.

156
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,639
Cameras. Phone records. ANPR.

157
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,680
Who did Jesse Halpin talk to
last night?

158
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,520
Have a seat.

159
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,639
This stays strictly between us.

160
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,440
But it won't hurt
to give you the heads up.

161
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,759
Jesse Halpin was questioned
by DI Ridley

162
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,839
in connection with
the Zoe Lindsey case.

163
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,399
The three-year-old abducted
near Dunmore Sands.

164
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,079
Yeah, I know. Must've been...
14 years ago.

165
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,879
West Riding were running
that case.

166
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,279
My old stomping ground.
Lowly DS back then.

167
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,799
Why was Ridley anywhere near it?
He was asked to rule out Halpin

168
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,799
after his plates flagged up
near the crime scene.

169
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,759
And was he ruled out?

170
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,879
Ridley was convinced
he was somehow connected.

171
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,079
You clearly weren't in agreement.

172
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,959
A suspect had already been arrested,
Daniel Preston.

173
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,959
A lot of evidence pointed to him,
but the charge never stuck.

174
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,439
So Ridley might actually
have been on to something?

175

If Ridley gets wind of this, he's
bound to start stirring things up.

176
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,399
Wouldn't hurt to bring him in.
See what he can add to the mix.

177
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,759
He's just lost his wife and
daughter, Carol. Full on breakdown.

178
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,239
I hear he can barely get out of bed.

179
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,319
This might give him
something to focus on?

180
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,960
I don't want him anywhere near it!

181
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,400
Last thing we need is Zoe Lindsey
coming back to haunt us.

245
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,799
Jesse Halpin.
Someone shot him last night.

246
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,639
So, what, you thought I might be
able to shed a bit of light on it?

247
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,639
Goodwin warned me
not to talk to you.

248
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,879
But he said that you had concerns
about Halpin.

249
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,759
Yeah, I was always convinced
he'd taken her.

250
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,399
What made you so sure?

251
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,159
Well, apart from inconsistencies
in his statement,

252
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,439
he could never explain
what he was doing in the area.

253
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,759
I asked them to keep on,
but they never did.

254
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,599
But they arrested a suspect.
A convicted sex offender.

255
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,359
Yeah. Daniel Preston.

256
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,479
He's serving time
for an unrelated offence.

257
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,199
Indecently assaulting a minor.

258
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,839
CPS ruled there was insufficient
evidence to charge him

259
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,599
with Zoe Lindsey's abduction.

260
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,040
And you think he was innocent?

261
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,360
The investigation was flawed,
I know that much.

262
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,040
Perhaps they were in it together?
Halpin and Preston.

Sweeped down to the sea. #

we're barely breaking even.

you know, you see,

284
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,879
you're giving away
too many free drinks.

You want a return
on your investment?

286
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,080

a bit of support, Alex.

346
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,399
9.46pm on the night
of Jesse Halpin's murder.

347
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,319
And again, nearly two hours later,
heading back towards the village.

348
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,719
I went for a drive.

349
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,799
You told us
you were in the pub all night.

350
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,959
I knew if you found out
me and Jesse had previous...

351
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,280
Well, what previous is this?

352
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,799
My dog were injured
in one of his snare traps.

353
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,119
He sets them in the woods.

354
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,959
To keep scrotes like you
off his property?

355
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,559
I took it to your lot.
Official complaint.

356
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,719
And they said I couldn't prove owt.

357
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,799
Your relationship
with Catherine Halpin.

358
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,839
You didn't think
that was worth mentioning?

359
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,399
Let's just say
it wasn't common knowledge.

360
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,719
I'm guessing he warned you off?

361
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,759
Said his daughter
were too good for us.

362
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,479
Oh, that must've been
a blow to the ego.

363
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,319
You know,
they worked her like a skivvy.

364
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,719
Kept her locked up on that farm.

365
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,359
OK, so he's warned you off
his daughter. Nobbled your dog.

366
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,639
Chances are
you were looking to even the score.

367
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,040
I didn't even see him that night!
So what were you doing in the woods?

368
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,720
Me and a mate, we went lamping.

369
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,719
That's hunting after dark.
Yeah, I know what it is.

370
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,439
There's always plenty of bait there.

371
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,919
So we just placed
a few bets on the dogs.

372
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,399
What about a firearm,
were you carrying?

373
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,959
OK, we had a gun.

374
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,559
Well, it's licensed. You can check.

375
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,159
Oh, we will.
Look, we heard a shot.

376
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,199
So we ran because we thought
he was coming for us.

377
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,319
Called in the dogs
and drove back to the village.

378
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,119
What, and then
got your mum to cover for ya?

379
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,959
Look, Jesse Halpin was
a piece of work,

380
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,920
and I'm not sorry he's dead.

381
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,320
But I didn't kill him.

382
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,559
This mate of yours...

383
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,320
we're gonna need his name.

384
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,839
'I brought you some books.'

385
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,839
Some of those racing sagas
that you like to read.

386
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,520
Good of you to remember.

387
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,159
How are you bearing up?

388
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,759
Every visit,
same sanctimonious concern.

389
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,040
Be rude not to ask.

390
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
My request for a transfer
was refused.

391
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,399
I wasn't aware you'd made one.

392
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,279
Maybe you could put in
a word for me?

393
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,079
Man of your standing.
Ex-copper to boot.

394
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,120
Ex-copper.

395
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,279
I don't think my word
would count for much.

396
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,479
You think I'm going to be safe
in the seg wing?

397
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,959
Banged up with the fruit loops
and the nonces?

398
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,199
You know what they'll do to a grass.
You'll just have to watch your back.

399
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,520
In case you're forgetting,
you owe me.

400
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,279
We're serving this sentence
together.

401
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,080
It were your fault
what I did that night.

402
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,719
Listen,
you don't have to answer this,

403
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,639
but how did your dad seem
in the days before he was killed?

404
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,720
Hadn't really seen too much of him.

405
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,240
They were arguing, night he died.

406
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,279
I heard them downstairs.

407
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,720
What were they arguing about?

408
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,360
It was usually money.

409
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,359
They even talked about
selling the land.

410
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,160
Buying somewhere smaller
in the village.

411
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,200
There was always
something stopping 'em.

412
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Come on.

413
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,120
Get yourself inside.

414
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,039
You had no cause to speak to her.
Not without me there.

415
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,800
We were questioning Steve Parry in
relation to your husband's murder.

416
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,199
Parrys are bad news.

417
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,160
You must have known that Catherine
and Steve were seeing each other?

418
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,959
This is what happens
when you let people in.

419
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,040
Nothing good ever comes of it.

420
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,480
Ever come across Daniel Preston
on the seg wing?

421
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,359
A man like that,
you learn to keep your distance.

422
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,119
Did he ever talk about his crimes?

423
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,679
In case you'd forgotten,
I don't sing for you these days.

424
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,639
You must have heard something,
rumours.

425
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,439
He has a certain notoriety.

426
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,280
The numbers only talk to each other.

427
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,159
Always competing
for bragging rights.

428
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,800
Did he ever mention Zoe Lindsey?

429
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,800
Not to my knowledge. Why do you ask?

430
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,239
Two days ago,
a man was murdered on my old patch.

431
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,560
Jesse Halpin.

432
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,239
I interviewed him at the time, in
connection with Zoe's disappearance.

433
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,959
And you think Preston took her?

434
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,640
He's always maintained
his innocence.

435
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,399
The powers that be
sent all kinds in to visit him,

436
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,280
pushing him to tell them
what he'd done with her.

437
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,359
Maybe he finally gave 'em something?

438
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,519
What makes you say that?

439
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,400
They released him on parole
a few days ago.

440
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,520
DOOR BUZZES

441
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,920
Lowlifes like Preston,
best not to indulge 'em, huh?

442
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,520
He'll be back inside soon enough.

443
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,240
Thanks for the books.

444
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,639
Got you a coffee.

445
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,159
OK.

446
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,079
Daniel Preston was released
two weeks ago.

447
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,920
Ten days before Jesse Halpin
was murdered.

448
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,200
Let's go.

449
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,000
That's him.
Thanks.

450
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,199
Daniel Preston?

451
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,799
Detective Inspector Farman,
Copelton Police.

452
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,359
What's this about?

453
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,319
Well, we'd like to ask you
a few questions

454
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,720
in connection with the abduction
of Zoe Lindsey.

455
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,720
Yeah. I mean, we can do it here
or we can go somewhere more private.

456
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,519
In case you'd forgotten,
they threw out the charges.

457
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,199
Police tried to stitch me up.

458
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,679
We need to talk to you in light
of some recent developments.

459
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,039
Jesse Halpin. Does that name
mean anything to you?

460
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,280
No. Can't say it does.

461
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,519
You may have come across him
about 14 years ago.

462
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,160
Yeah. Yeah, the face... Yeah, maybe.

463
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,600
I think he, erm,
he worked at the park that summer.

464
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,479
Dunmore Sands?
Yeah.

465
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,359
Could only have been
a couple of weeks.

466
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,319
The manager took him on.

467
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,359
And what work
was he doing there exactly?

468
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,839
Odds and sods.
Wherever he was needed.

469
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,839
I didn't have anything
to do with him.

470
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,639
You know that Jessie Halpin was
questioned as a person of interest

471
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,799
during the time
of Zoe Lindsey's abduction.

472
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,040
What's that got to do with me?

473
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,400
He was murdered three nights ago.

474
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,640
A few days after
you got out of prison.

475
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,039
What, and you think I did it?

476
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:16,079
Well, if you knew who'd taken her,
you might want to even the score

477
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,760
for all the years everyone pointed
the finger at you.

478
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,880
7pm curfew.

479
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,080
I guess that puts me in the clear.

480
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,800
I've been reading
a list of your previous convictions.

481
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,439
Possession of child pornography.
Five counts of indecent assault.

482
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,440
Statuary rape of a minor.
Was that a stitch-up, too?

483
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Do you think you're the first person
to try and get me to confess?

484
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,279
I've been threatened, bribed,
all sorts of promises.

485
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,080
Well, maybe this is a chance
to clear your name?

486
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,599
Nah.

487
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,360
I'd rather take my chances.

488
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,239
We pulled out
Jessie Halpin's phone records.

489
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,039
Three unanswered calls from his wife
the night he died.

490
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,039
I ran a background check on
the daughter with social services.

491
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,599
The home-schooling flags up some
concerns. They queried neglect.

492
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,079
She also missed her MMR jabs,

493
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,239
several childhood
medical appointments

494
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,559
and developmental checks.

495
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,999
There don't seem to have been
any major issues.

496
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,599
I'm glad you think so, Darren.

497
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,439
I just meant...
How old is that lad of yours?

498
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,799
Well, he'll be four in a few weeks.

499
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,559
Well, why don't you run
this list by his mum.

500
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,200
And then you get back to me, yeah.
Carol! A word.

501
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,959
I just got a call from
Daniel Preston's probation officer

502
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,599
accusing us of police harassment.

503
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,640
I was all set to update you...
Well, I'm all ears.

504
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,639
Halpin worked at Dunmore Sands

505
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,519
the summer that Zoe Lindsey
went missing.

506
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,119
If Halpin and Preston
were acquainted,

507
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,799
his death could be connected to
Zoe's disappearance.

508
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,679
So, now Preston's in the frame
for his murder?

509
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,759
I just think that Ridley
might be on to something.

510
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,119
Well, this just gets better!

511
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,359
I might've known
he'd be pulling your strings!

512
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,960
We're obligated to investigate it.

513
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,400
That was my call to make -
not yours.

514
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,599
You worked the original case.
A case that was never solved.

515
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,999
If we could reopen it,

516
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,200
I really think
these cases could be connected.

517
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,400
I'd need to take it to the Super.
I still want Ridley in on this.

518
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,759
You really think
this is going to fix him?

519
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,039
He's going to go after Halpin anyway
and make some noise.

520
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,799
Surely, it's better
to have him onside?

521
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,280
I think he has something to offer.

522
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,839
Are you sure you wanna do this?

523
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,880
HE SCOFFS

524
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,279
It's too late to turn back now.

525
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,440
You've got nothing to prove
any more.

526
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,560
I don't know.

527
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,120
Mr Ridley,
we'll need to sign you in.

528
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,079
Oh, I wasn't expecting
a welcoming committee.

529
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,879
Thought I'd take the opportunity
to lay down some ground rules.

530
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,319
You will answer to Mr Ridley

531
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,079
as you're no longer
a working detective.

532
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,119
I've answered to worse.

533
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,999
No access to the PNC.
No powers of arrest.

534
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,359
You can question suspects out in
the field, but never under caution.

535
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,760
Hands off. Arm's length.
Hardly worth my while coming back.

536
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,079
Let's get one thing straight,
shall we?

537
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,719
I only cleared this
with human resources

538
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,359
after I guaranteed personally
that you're fit and able to work.

539
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,880
I put my neck on the line for you.
Don't let me down, Ridley.

540
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,999
Adless Woods homicide.

541
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,719
We are pursuing
a new line of inquiry.

542
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,479
A connection
to a well-known cold case.

543
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,399
We think it's possible
that Jesse Halpin

544
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,000
may have been involved in
the abduction of Zoe Lindsey and...

545
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,159
The three-year-old was abducted

546
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,239
from Dunmore Sands Caravan Park
where she lived.

547
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,039
Missing, presumed dead.

548
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,599
A 34-year-old male was arrested
on suspicion of her abduction.

549
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,919
Daniel Preston, a convicted sex
offender who worked at the park,

550
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,159
was never charged,
but remains under suspicion.

551
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,839
The evidence was circumstantial.

552
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,639
So what's Halpin's connection
to the cold case?

553
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,839
I interviewed him
at the time as a person of interest,

554
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,839
and his plates were flagged up
in the area where Zoe went missing.

555
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,439
He could never really explain
what he was doing there.

556
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,239
There were also inconsistencies in
his statement that raised concerns.

557
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,159
Concerns that were
taken on board at the time.

558
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,799
And subsequently disregarded.

559
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,360
He was clean. No previous.
Nothing that tied him to any crime.

560
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,679
Er, Preston claims that Halpin

561
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,839
worked at the caravan site
that summer.

562
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,559
A fact that was missing
in the initial investigation.

563
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,639
If the two of them
were acting together...

564
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,119
That's pure supposition.

565
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,360
Gives Preston a motive
for Halpin's murder.

566
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,919
We could be looking at extortion.
Reprisals.

567
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,639
A catch-up between
two guilty parties.

568
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,919
We can rule Preston out
as our murder suspect.

569
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,479
We've established that he was under
a Home Detention Curfew.

570
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,999
But he can place Halpin
in the caravan park.

571
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,039
So that puts Halpin
back in the frame for the abduction.

572
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,439
All right, everyone.

573
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,199
I don't want the press
getting wind of this.

574
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,319
Could blow up in our faces.

575
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,319
Over 100 people say
that they saw Zoe Lindsey

576
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,119
the day that she went missing.

577
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,719
Case files, statements, evidence.

578
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,679
Anything that might tie Jesse Halpin
to the Zoe Lindsey case.

579
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,119
Just to be clear, well,
is DI Ridley back on the team?

580
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,479
Mr Ridley is here in the role
of Investigative Support.

581
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,239
Temporary consultancy basis.

582
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,120
In case anyone's forgotten,
we've still got a murder to solve.

583
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,439
We were wiped out by foot and mouth.

584
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,639
They told us
we had to cull the whole flock.

585
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,359
That summer, we were flat broke.

586
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,400
And how did Jesse hear
about the job at the caravan park?

587
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,599
Saw it advertised in a local paper,
I think.

588
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,639
It was only a summer job.

589
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,800
He also visited Dunmore Sands
on a later occasion.

590
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,079
Same day, a three-year-old child
was abducted.

591
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,239
You're the copper
what questioned him.

592
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,799
The missing child.

593
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,239
Her name was Zoe Lindsey.
Jesse had nothing to do with that.

594
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,720
He also lied to the police about
his movements that day, Mrs Halpin.

595
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,759
He's not even gone to his grave.

596
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,799
And you come to my house
and drag it all back up again.

597
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,319
Did Jesse ever mention
a man named Daniel Preston?

598
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,959
What has this got to do
with the murder of my husband?

599
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
Just answer the question,
Mrs Halpin.

600
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,200
Not that I remember.

601
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,640
Now, if we're done here,
I've got work to do.

602
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,159
Her husband was murdered.

603
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,519
What happened
to compassionate policing?

604
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,479
Oh, come on, she's covering for him,
she must know something.

605
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,239
Is this really about
closing a cold case,

606
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,320
or is it actually about getting
one over on Goodwin?

607
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,719
This is about a parent
who lost a child 14 years ago.

608
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,599
But we've got nothing on Halpin.

609
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,919
Except that he worked there
that summer.

610
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,200
Well, maybe it's time we went back
to the crime scene.

611
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,800
Penny Lindsey?

612
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,400
This was the picture
they used on the posters.

613
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,080
She took that doll with her
everywhere.

614
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,960
She never let it out of her sight.

615
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,320
She had it with her the...

616
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,239
Look, we know it's gonna be
very difficult for you

617
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,799
to tell us what happened, but...

618
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,280
It helps... somehow.

619
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,840
Keeps her alive.

620
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,040
Can you tell us what you remember?

621
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,480
Er, she'd gone out to play
with her friends.

622
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,079
Kids on the park ran wild
in the summer.

623
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,999
It was a safe place.
A friendly place.

624
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,879
When she didn't come back home
for her tea,

625
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,479
I wasn't especially worried.

626
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,759
Then it went dark. Still no sign.

627
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,800
That's when they started the search.
Sorry, can I...?

628
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,480
They said it was neglect.

629
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,080
That I'd been drinking.

630
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,400
Even suggested
I might have hurt her. I...

631
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,720
Do you ever remember
seeing this man?

632
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
His name's Jesse Halpin.

633
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,640
We think he was working here
the summer that Zoe went missing.

634
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,919
Has someone come forward?
Is that why you're here?

635
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,159
We're just following up
some routine inquiries.

636
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,679
Yeah. He was questioned at the time
by detectives.

637
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,200
He was a person of interest.

638
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,279
But we all know who took her.

639
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,159
It was Daniel Preston.
Can you be so sure about that?

640
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,480
Something about him,
it just wasn't right.

641
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,560
Then the police found all that stuff
on his laptop.

642
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,559
You know, if I'd known what he was,

643
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,439
I'd have never let him
anywhere near her.

644
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,920
It wasn't your fault, you know,
what happened.

645
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,519
Well, she was my little girl.

646
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,399
Hm.

647
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,840
I couldn't protect her.

648
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,399
Right, Jesse Halpin.

649
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,519
Yeah, took him on for six weeks,
June 2007.

650
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,600
You're lucky
I've still got the book.

651
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,600
This about Zoe?
Only, I saw you talking to Penny.

652
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,799
We had a few questions we needed
to ask her, Mrs Moreland, yeah.

653
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,439
She used to leave her with me
in this office. Three years old.

654
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,119
Disappear to the pub.

655
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,599
Some days,
she'd even forget to feed her.

656
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,479
Daniel Preston,

657
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,759
that caretaker's job,
did you give him that?

658
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,040
References checked out.

659
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,039
None of us had any idea.

660
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,120
And I had a lad of my own
to look out for.

661
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,799
Yeah, Adam Moreland.
I remember his name on the file.

662
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,840
Well, he was with her
the day she was taken.

663
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,360
Followed him everywhere, she did.

664
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,199
And how old was Adam then?

665
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,199
Maybe six. Seven.

666
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,519
And did the police
take a statement from him?

667
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,639
Well, I know they asked him
some questions.

668
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,879
But they ruled him out
as a credible witness.

669
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,479
Oh, might be useful for us
to speak to him again.

670
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,199
You know, in light of
some recent developments.

671
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,399
Adam's only just about
getting his life together.

672
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,359
It'll do him no good
to go back there.

673
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:28,280
Well, we wouldn't ask, you know,
if it wasn't important.

674
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,679
We, er, got that statement
from Steve Parry's mate, sir.

675
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,240
Backed up his alibi.

676
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,879
Course he did.

677
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,679
We've got no evidence that ties him
to Halpin's murder.

678
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,359
What about the firearm?

679
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,840
Ballistic report shows it
wasn't the gun that killed Halpin.

680
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,680
Either we find something
solid to charge him with... Fine.

681
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,640
Get him signed out.
Sir.

682
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,960
I told the police what happened.
Over and over.

683
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,400
Not that it made much difference.
We're listening now.

684
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,400
And what makes you think
I want to talk about it?

685
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,559
Well, if it could help us
to find out what happened to Zoe.

686
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,680
One more time couldn't hurt, Adam.
Yeah?

687
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,840
It was baking that day.

688
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,000
Summer holidays.

689
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,840
Zoe said she wanted an ice cream.

690
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,679
I'd managed to cadge some money
off someone. I can't remember who.

691
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,640
I was stood in the queue
at the prom.

692
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,359
When I turned back to look for her,
she was talking to somebody.

693
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,639
He'd pulled up
in a white van by the slipway.

694
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,359
Did you recognise the driver?

695
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,559
I didn't see his face.

696
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,079
But the police said
it must have been Preston.

697
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,199
Oh, yeah.

698
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,959
But you couldn't say for sure?
No.

699
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,119
But he used his van
when he needed to move stuff.

700
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,079
Did you see what happened to Zoe?

701
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,279
By the time I'd bought
the ice cream, I looked back,

702
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,439
the van had gone.
She was nowhere to be seen.

703
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,799
But you think she got into
that vehicle? I don't know!

704
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,520
It's fine. It's OK.

705
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,639
Look...

706
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,360
need you to look at this photograph.
Do you recognise him?

707
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,040
Should I?
Name's Jesse Halpin.

708
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,519
She'd never have gone off
with a stranger.

709
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,159
We spoke to Daniel Preston.
He's out on parole.

710
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,639
He claims that Halpin
worked at the caravan site

711
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,439
the summer Zoe went missing.

712
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,079
Preston's out of prison?

713
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,680
Just need you to look
at the photograph, Adam.

714
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,719
I've spent 14 years
trying to forget what's happened.

715
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,680
Last thing I need is people
like you stirring it all back up.

716
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,680
I should get back to work.

717
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,759
The investigating team
just assumed the van was Preston's.

718
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,759
The van was taken apart.
Not a shred of forensic evidence.

719
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,319
Yeah, well, maybe they were looking
in the wrong place.

720
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,159
We've still got nothing
that ties this abduction to Halpin.

721
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,399
Haven't we?

722
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,599
Those plates that flagged
Halpin up as a possible suspect,

723
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,880
they were registered
to a white minivan.

724
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,239
We've got a statement
from Gill Moreland,

725
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,679
the manager of the caravan park,

726
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,719
confirming that Jessie Halpin worked
there for six weeks that summer.

727
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,799
He was probably
just casing the place.

728
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,159
Went back a few weeks later
and abducted Zoe.

729
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,399
I know this much, while
you've been off chasing shadows,

730
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,000
we're still no closer
to finding out who killed him.

731
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,239
You may not remember Gill's son,
Adam?

732
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,519
He was the little boy
who was with Zoe all that day.

733
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,079
He remembers her talking to someone
who pulled up in a white van.

734
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,559
Daniel Preston's van.
No! He did NOT say that

735
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,360
because he did not see his face.

736
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,679
That's the kind of evidence that
would have pushed us towards Halpin.

737
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,400
No decent copper
would have missed those connections!

738
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,799
You think I haven't questioned
my own mistakes?

739
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,159
The lack of a conviction,
our failure to find her,

740
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,759
every hour she was missing,
every dubious decision.

741
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,080
You think it hasn't stopped me
sleeping at night?

742
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,040
Well, if mistakes were made...

743
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,000
..maybe this is our chance
to put them right.

744
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,520
I'll apply for a warrant
to search the farm.

745
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,280
Boss!

746
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,999
The van was never used.
The clutch was buggered.

747
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,879
Should have been scrapped years ago.

748
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,719
So why did Jesse keep it locked up,
hidden, out of sight?

749
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,159
Because he was a hoarder.

750
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,759
All that junk in the farm yard,
could never throw anything away.

751
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,679
We will need to get it
checked over by forensics.

752
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,559
You had Steve Parry locked up.
It's him you should be talking to!

753
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,199
Oh, yeah, that complaint that
Steve Parry made against Jesse.

754
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,680
It was something and nothing.
Something and nothing?

755
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,839
His dog was injured by a snare trap.

756
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,480
He shouldn't have been in
them woods. Jesse warned him.

757
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,560
Any time now, if we're sharing?

758
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,279
You said the crime scene
didn't give us anything.

759
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,399
But it's the one thing
that connects the two cases.

760
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,639
Why was Halpin so desperate
to keep people out of these woods?

761
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,120
TWIG SNAPS

762
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,839
You check in here.

763
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,360
I'll go down to the shed.
OK.

764
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,120
Lorna?

765
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,160
It's DI Farman.

766
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,920
It's OK.

767
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,800
We just want to talk to you,
that's all.

768
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,480
Put the gun down, Lorna.

769
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,640
Put the gun down,
we don't want anybody else killed.

770
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,320
Just put the gun down.

771
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,360
That's it. I'll take that.

772
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,840
It's all right.

773
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,240
SHE EXHALES

774
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,519
Our ballistics team have confirmed

775
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,119
that the shotgun
found in your possession

776
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,559
was indeed the firearm used
to shoot Jesse Halpin.

777
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,239
Unless you can explain how that
came to be in your possession,

778
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,000
then I have reasonable grounds
to charge you with murder.

779
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,879
Well, I took it from the shed.

780
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,960
When did you take it?

781
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,199
Can't remember.

782
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,759
Also recovered were a pair of
Wellington boots from your property.

783
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,720
Sole treads matched those found
at the crime scene.

784
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,920
Well, I found him that morning.
I told you.

785
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,560
Well, I think that you killed him
the evening before...

786
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,119
..when he was coming back
from the pub.

787
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,719
And you left him for dead
on the path.

788
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,240
And then you went back the next
morning to cover up your tracks.

789
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,280
He said I'd have to leave the farm.

790
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,519
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

791
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,639
Was this the night he was murdered?

792
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,599
No!

793
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,600
No, it were years ago!
The day she...

794
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,960
Lorna, you're not making any sense.

795
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,240
He swore it were an accident.

796
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,959
Said he never would have hurt her.

797
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,160
The little girl.

798
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,920
Zoe Lindsey.

799
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,800
Look at the photograph, Lorna.

800
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,960
"I were part of it," he said.

801
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,320
Made me swear not to speak of it.

802
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,560
What did you do with the body,
Lorna?

803
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,319
Hm?

804
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,880
I know you want to tell us.

805
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,720
We put her in a box.

806
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,760
And we buried her.

807
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,040
That tree.

808
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,040
Yeah, it was here.

809
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,880
We'll need to lock this space down.

810
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,600
I've got to check in with Goodwin.
Come with me.

811
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,000
You know, my dad used to tell me
these woods were haunted.

812
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,360
Scared me half to death
when I were little.

813
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,600
Maybe he had his reasons.

814
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,199
I found a bird
with a broken wing once.

815
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,320
It had fallen
out of one of these trees.

816
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,679
I rescued it
and nursed it back to health.

817
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:23,240
And for a while, it was fine,
but then it died.

818
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,840
He told me that the bird
didn't need its body any more.

819
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,160
Its soul had flown away
and found someone else.

820
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,000
I don't think you should be here,
you know.

821
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,039
They're looking for a body,
aren't they?

822
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,519
Look, I'll take you back
to the house.

823
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,080
What, you think I can stand
to be near her after this?

824
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,160
FAINT: Ridley?

825
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,400
Ridley?

826
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,959
We're scanning the site
with a hyperspectral camera.

827
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,399
Could be hours before we find
anything. I'll call you when we do.

828
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,520
Thank you.

829
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,440
All right.
Hiya.

830
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,479
Are you all on your own?
Mum went out.

831
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,720
Work drinks, or summat.

832
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,440
You doing your homework?
Yeah.

833
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,760
How you getting on?
Gonna be a while yet.

834
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,399
Mum!
What?

835
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,319
You used to love it
when I mussed up your hair.

836
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,200
Yeah, when I was, like, five.

837
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,199
Why don't we order a pizza tonight?

838
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,080
Can't really be bothered to cook.
You never cook, Mum.

839
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,280
I'm sorry I haven't really
been around much lately.

840
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,999
I told Oscar and Jase
you'd been promoted.

841
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,159
Oh, yeah. Detective Inspector.
They said it was kind of sick.

842
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,839
SHE CHUCKLES
Yeah.

843
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,640
I suppose it is kind of sick
when you think about it.

844
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,960
You gonna drink that
or just stare at it all night?

845
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,840
I saw Michael Flannery.

846
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,000
What is this,
you just prolonging the agony?

847
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,479
Punishing yourself.

848
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,439
I don't pretend to understand it
myself, Annie,

849
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,879
to tell you the truth.

850
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,480
He killed your wife.
Your daughter. My best friend.

851
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,160
He doesn't deserve your forgiveness.

852
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,999
I've been thinking about that young
lad that Ella was going out with.

853
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,039
What was his name?
Owen.

854
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,199
Owen. Owen. Owen.

855
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,959
I've been thinking about them,
you know?

856
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,279
Would they have got together?

857
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,119
Would they have got married,
had kids?

858
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,919
They'd fallen out,
the night of the fire,

859
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,279
they'd fallen out.

860
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,879
I was down the station.
If only I'd stayed at home.

861
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,400
If only I'd stayed at home.

862
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,000
I picked up the phone
to call Kate last week.

863
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,080
Something trivial
I wanted to share with her.

864
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,200
And then I remembered
that she wasn't around any more.

865
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,840
Still hits me like a punch.

866
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,520
Same way it did when
you first told me they were dead.

867
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,120
It was me he was coming for, Annie.

868
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,920
When Flannery set the fire,
it was unfinished business.

869
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,840
It was me who should have burned
that night.

870
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,960
PHONE RINGS

871
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,399
We've recovered
the remains of a body.

872
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,680
We've reason to suspect
that it's Zoe Lindsey.

873
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,959
"Reasons to suspect."

874
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,159
You've got nothing.

875
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,479
We've also interviewed
Lorna Spalden,

876
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,000
who told us that
she helped Jesse bury the body.

877
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,479
Lorna'd say anything
if you asked her to,

878
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,319
if someone put her up to it.

879
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,599
Lorna was found in possession
of your husband's shotgun.

880
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,800
The weapon we now know
was used to kill him.

881
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,079
Jesse always kept it locked away.
Did Lorna have access to the keys?

882
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,879
They were kept on a hook
in the annexe.

883
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,559
She'll be making an appearance
in court later today.

884
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,360
We're looking for a warrant
for further detention.

885
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,119
Is Catherine home?

886
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,280
You shouldn't be alone
at a time like this.

887
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,960
Catherine's gone.

888
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,880
She took off last night.

889
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,680
Why couldn't you have
just left us alone to grieve?

890
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,320
Still leaving
a spare key under the mat?

891
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,639
The skeletal remains
of an infant child.

892
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,079
Shape of the pelvis would suggest
she was female.

893
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,799
Right, and how long do you think
she'd been down there?

894
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,599
I'd say somewhere between
10-15 years.

895
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,719
Is this a fracture?

896
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,600
I'm pretty certain
that's what killed her.

897
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,600
Any chance of a positive ID?

898
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,359
I might be able to extract
some mitochondrial DNA

899
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,119
from the marrow in the leg bones.

900
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,639
IF Penny Lindsey agrees
to provide us with a swab,

901
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,079
we can run it for a familial match.

902
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,519
It would tell us for certain
if they're related.

903
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,719
What do you think you're playing at
coming back here?

904
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,399
The police have been round
asking questions.

905
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,639
Jesse Halpin.
Hm.

906
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,359
They're saying
it was him that took her.

907
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:21,839
Well, we'll never know now, will we?
He's dead.

908
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,999
The last chance
of clearing your name.

909
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,359
I never laid a finger on Zoe.

910
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,120
You know that
better than anyone else.

911
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,999
I need you to tell 'em the truth.

912
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,360
What,
that you were with me that night?

913
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,519
Never gonna happen!

914
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,079
You know what they'd do
to a paedophile's girlfriend.

915
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,399
Thought I might get a place
round here

916
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,120
soon as my parole's up.

917
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,760
Get one of them caravans
down near the dunes.

918
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,600
Nothing too fancy.

919
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,360
We could pick up where we left off.

920
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,800
You disgust me.

921
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,120
Maybe I'll pass.

922
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,360
Place looks on its arse to me.

923
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,520
Preston!

924
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,160
Adam! No!

925
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,240
DOOR BUZZES

926
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,119
I was angry.

927
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,039
I lashed out.

928
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,639
What was Daniel Preston
even doing in the caravan park?

929
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,160
He'd been to see my mum.

930
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,759
Trying to wheedle his way back
into her good books.

931
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,640
Not to mention her bed.

932
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,280
Your mum and Daniel Preston?

933
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,520
Oh, I knew what they got up to.
Even as a kid.

934
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,799
It's the only reason
he got that caretaker job.

935
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,040
Did the police know about this
at the time?

936
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,160
That she was sleeping with the man
that took Zoe Lindsey?

937
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,359
Is he gonna be OK?

938
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,599
He's got a bleed on the brain.

939
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,560
You'd better hope
that he pulls through.

940
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,079
KNOCK ON DOOR

941
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,280
DOOR BUZZES

942
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,079
We found the body of a child...

943
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,559
buried up on Jesse Halpin's land.

944
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,880
No!

945
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,000
You think it might be Zoe?

946
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,279
Well, we can run a DNA test

947
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,480
to confirm
if there's a familial match. No.

948
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,959
Look...

949
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,799
I know it's gonna be hard, but...

950
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,200
You have no idea!

951
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,480
SHE SOBS

952
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,600
Wouldn't it be easier in the end,
Penny...

953
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,479
..to get to the truth
of what happened?

954
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,120
Then she's never coming back.

955
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,999
No.

956
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,919
No, I'm not sure
I'm ready for that.

957
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,200
SOBBING

958
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,760
I lost my wife and daughter.

959
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,920
They died in a terrible house fire.

960
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,800
I would do anything...

961
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,720
..anything...

962
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,480
..to get some answers to...

963
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,280
To get some closure, you know?
To move on.

964
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,279
How old was she, your daughter?

965
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,520
Ella, she was 19.

966
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,439
You had her for longer
than I had Zoe.

967
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,400
I did, yeah.

968
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,720
Anything'd be better than this,
Penny, wouldn't it?

969
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,840
Living in some kind of purgatory.

970
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,280
All I want is a swab.

971
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,920
Yeah?

972
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,159
14 years of hating Preston.

973
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,679
But now you're telling me
he might not have taken her,

974
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,880
that someone else...

975
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,799
The evidence that the police found
on Preston's computer.

976
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,559
How did you find out about that?

977
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,760
One of the detectives
must've told me.

978
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,039
It was the woman in charge.

979
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,840
DI Dixon?
Yeah.

980
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,119
I was very pleasantly surprised
when I got your message.

981
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,200
It's been a while
since I've been invited to lunch.

982
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,960
Forensics have discovered a body,
Jean.

983
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,240
It was buried up in Adless Woods.

984
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,599
Lured me here under false pretences.

985
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,520
We've also recovered a white van
hidden on Halpin's farm.

986
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,839
The same farm that I pushed you
to search 14 years ago.

987
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,519
We had no solid evidence.

988
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,959
You had a first-hand account

989
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,279
of Zoe Lindsey's abduction
from Adam Moreland.

990
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,639
A contradictory testimony
from a seven-year-old child.

991
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,440
That you manipulated
to suit your version of the truth.

992
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:34,639
Daniel Preston took Zoe.
That was always the consensus.

993
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,079
For Christ's sake, Jean.
"The consensus." You were the SIO!

994
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,359
And I needed an arrest!

995
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,719
So you found a suitable suspect
and you set about fitting him up.

996
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:47,239
You also shared confidential
information about a murder inquiry

997
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,879
with Penny Lindsey,

998
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,839
a mother
who wanted somebody to blame.

999
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,719
I did what I had to do.

1000
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,719
If you'd gone after Halpin,
Zoe Lindsey might still be alive.

1001
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,959
She'd been missing for days, Ridley.

1002
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,480
We both know she was already dead!

1003
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:15,239
WHISPERING: It was a... a moment.

1004
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,760
A misstep.

1005
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,640
You're stonewalled.
You're damaged goods.

1006
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,080
I don't need to tell you
how that feels.

1007
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,840
Oh, I know.

1008
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,400
All those years
of distinguished service.

1009
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,920
They don't count for much.

1010
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:44,200
WHISPERING: Let this go, Ridley.
For old time's sake.

1011
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,960
Sorry, Jean, I can't.

1012
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,520
After all that's happened,
there'll be an inquiry.

1013
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,720
You were never a team player.

1014
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,880
That was always your trouble.

1015
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,999
We ran tests on the clothing.

1016
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,079
Green cotton top.
Polyester trousers.

1017
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,199
Both of which were 80% decomposed.

1018
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,399
No traces of any fibres.
No skin cells. No bodily fluids.

1019
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,319
Any touch DNA we do lift
is likely to be seriously degraded.

1020
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,599
So, nothing to implicate Halpin,
then?

1021
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,399
Dental X-rays.

1022
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,639
The deciduous teeth
were all still in place.

1023
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,759
I can say with near certainty that
this child was under five years old.

1024
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,039
Zoe was three when she disappeared.

1025
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,159
Now, hang on a minute. Hang on.

1026
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,320
Zoe was missing a tooth
at this point, wasn't she?

1027
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,519
Which immediately rang
alarm bells.

1028
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,519
So, what are you saying,
that there might be some doubt?

1029
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,679
I ran the bone marrow DNA
against the sample

1030
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,639
we took from Penny Lindsey.

1031
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,919
They didn't match.

1032
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:02,200
What?!
The body we found isn't Zoe.

1033
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,640
The child that you buried
in Adless Woods...

1034
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,520
..wasn't Zoe Lindsey.

1035
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,159
You helped Jesse Halpin
bury that child, Lorna.

1036
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,000
Why won't you give us her name?

1037
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,999
I can't.

1038
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,720
We know she died
from a blow to the head.

1039
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,399
Were you with Jesse
when he killed her?

1040
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,800
Jesse... Jesse never killed anyone!

1041
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,159
She were already dead
when he found her!

1042
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,560
But you said it was an accident
the last time we spoke to you.

1043
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,160
He told me she'd fallen.

1044
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,440
Climbed up on the tractor
when no-one was looking.

1045
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,160
Wanted to sit with her dad.

1046
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,640
We... We carried her
into the farmhouse.

1047
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,120
Laid her out on the table.

1048
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,400
Still as stone, she was.

1049
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,639
Moll...

1050
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,960
Moll said a prayer to Our Lady.

1051
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,360
The same words over and over.

1052
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,520
"Blessed Mary, pray for us."

1053
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,200
She couldn't live
with what had happened.

1054
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,440
Sent her half mad with grief.

1055
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,520
SHE SOBS

1056
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,279
Let's get into the barn.

1057
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,639
Can you go to the barn as well,
please?

1058
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,920
Can you just lock it off here?

MUSIC BOX PLAYS

1060
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,400
Ridley?

1061
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,439
There's no sign of her outside.
The team are searching the farm.

1062
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,519
How old is Catherine Halpin?

1063
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,960
Social services report said
she's 17.

1064
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,760
Zoe Lindsey isn't dead, Carol.

1065
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:09,280
She's been hiding in plain sight
for 14 years.

1066
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,679
I wanted to take her to hospital,

1067
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,559
but Jesse said
there'd be too many questions.

1068
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,479
He never trusted outsiders.

1069
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,280
He said if we nursed her,
she'd get better.

1070
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,960
But she didn't get better, did she?

1071
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,720
But we were blessed
when God brought her back to us.

1072
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,759
And the accident that
led to your daughter's death,

1073
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,840
can you remember the date
that it happened?

1074
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,519
June 3rd.

1075
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,199
We were cutting the first grass
for haylage.

1076
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,639
And she would have been
how old then?

1077
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,080
She'd just turned three.

1078
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,200
But you must have known
she'd be missed.

1079
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,679
That people would start
asking questions.

1080
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,359
Only a matter of time, Jesse said.

1081
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,439
Yet, he went off
looking for work in Dunmore Sands?

1082
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,280
Where he found our little girl.

1083
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,719
Our little lost soul
made flesh and blood.

1084
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,840
So you knew he planned to take her?

1085
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,760
He did it for me.

1086
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:51,159
To save me, he said.
She was someone else's child.

1087
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,679
That woman never cared for her,
not the way we did.

1088
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:59,279
We gave her a good home.
A better life.

1089
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,959
Everything she needed.

1090
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,880
Daniel Preston, was he involved?

1091
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,799
Well... we'd heard
he'd been arrested.

1092
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,239
We saw it on the news.

1093
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,239
But...

1094
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,959
Jesse barely remembered him.

1095
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,440
That was handy, wasn't it?
A convicted sex offender.

1096
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,119
The man everyone assumed
had taken Zoe.

1097
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,839
Her name's Catherine!

1098
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:27,360
I take it "Catherine" is none
the wiser about who she really is?

1099
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,119
And Jesse wanted to tell her.

1100
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,839
Cos he couldn't live
with what he'd done.

1101
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,919
She's all grown up, Moll.
She's got her own life to live.

1102
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,199
Will you keep your voice down?

1103
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,439
We keep her locked up here,
she'll start resenting us.

1104
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,159
And how do you think she'll feel
if she found out the truth?

1105
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,079
Maybe she deserves to know.

1106
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,039
Maybe it's time she was told.

1107
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,879
Je... Jesse..

1108
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:51,599
I tried to make him see sense,
to see reason.

1109
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,440
But, no, he wouldn't listen.
He stormed off to the pub.

1110
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,640
Like he always did.

1111
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,039
So Lorna didn't kill him.

1112
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,040
She just took the gun afterwards.

1113
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,360
She was just looking out for us.

1114
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,800
The way she's always done.

1115
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,200
Who's there?

1116
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,960
Moll?

1117
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,240
HE GRUNTS

1118
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,200
I...

1119
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,400
I couldn't lose another child.

1120
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:14,560
Don't you see? I couldn't.

1121
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,959
Moll Halpin, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder

1122
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,559
and also
on suspicion of kidnapping.

1123
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,359
You have a right to remain silent.
You don't have to say anything,

1124
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,520
but anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1125
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:54,240
She needs to hear this from me,
from her mam.

1126
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,440
You'd do anything...

1127
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,840
..anything to get a child back.

1128
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,239
To fill the void.

1129
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:18,479
It could never justify
what Halpin did.

1130
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,200
No.

1131
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,800
He lost his daughter.

1132
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,720
He thought he was losing his wife.

1133
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,800
He must have thought
his whole world was ending.

1134
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,119
No, please.

1135
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,119
Catherine!

1136
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,000
I'm so sorry.

1137
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,840
I always knew
there was something.

1138
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,399
A distance.

1139
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,360
Like they never really knew me.

1140
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,640
None of it was real.

1141
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,240
They loved you, though.

1142
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,759
Despite what they did.

1143
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,360
I mean that was real, wasn't it?

1144
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,400
I don't know who I am any more.

1145
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,600

in all the pictures...

1148
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,200
..they stole her away.

1149
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,440
She's gone.

1150
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,479
Hey. I hope you're not leaving

Oh, I just didn't want to outstay
my welcome, that's all.

OK.

1153
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,639
You know,
if you hadn't contacted me,

1154
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,679
I would definitely
have come looking for you.

1155
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:49,439
Still got one more call to make if
you want to come along for the ride?

1156
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,240
No. I think you've got it covered.

1157
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,920
I'll catch you later, then, yeah?
Yeah.
