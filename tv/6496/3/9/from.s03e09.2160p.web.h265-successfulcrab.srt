前情提要...
Previously on From...

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,120
这就是你要离婚的原因
That's why you wanted a divorce

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,290
因为这样你就能轻易逃避
'cause it would be easier for you to cut and run,

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,380
不用努力重建我们的家庭
instead of trying to put our family back together!

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,420
和妻子在一起的时候
When you're with your wife,

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,130
你他妈应该闭嘴好好听她说
you should shut the fuck up and listen.

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,550
你现在的做法
What you're doing,

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,050
你这样紧紧抓住一切
how tight you're holding on to everything,

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,930
其实是因为你害怕
you're doing it because you're scared.

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,810
自从我醒来后 我就一直不对劲
Ever since I woke up, something has been happening to me.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,440
我能听到人们的尖叫声
I hear people screaming.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,360
勇敢一点 你一定能克服困难的
You're at a threshold. The hero has to be brave.

14

朱莉 朱莉
Julie! Julie!

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,780
是那个穿白衣的男孩
It was the boy in white.

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,660
是他在告诉克里斯托弗那些秘密
He was the one that was telling secrets to Christopher.

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,240
克里斯托弗不愿去那棵树那里 所以
Christopher wouldn't go to the tree, so...

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,080
什么
What?

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,750
我告诉了妈妈白衣男孩说的话
I told my mother what the Boy in White said.

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,580
帮帮我 埃尔金
Help me, Elgin.

21
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,130
我能救你们所有人
I can save all of you.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,430
这真的就是事发地点吗
Is this really where it happens?

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,640
我们当时在温室里
We were in the greenhouse.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,140
她想帮我
She was trying to help me.

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,770
法蒂玛
Oh, Fatima!

26
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,650
我让你走
I said go!

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,650
我控制不住自己
I couldn't stop.

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,190
要么是她体内有什么可怕的东西在生长
There is either something horrible growing inside of her

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,490
要么就是这个地方终于摧毁了她的理智
or else this place has finally broken her mind.

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,370
如果你不告诉所有人 那我来说
But if you are not gonna tell everyone, then I am.

31
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,910
我每周会在小屋给你留两次补给
I'm gonna leave supplies for you at the shack twice a week.

32
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,370
法蒂玛
Fatima!

33
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,040
只有那里对孩子来说是安全的
It's the only place that the baby will be safe.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,340
根本没有孩子
There is no baby!

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,500
有的
Yes, there is.

36
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,130
只是不是你的
It's just not yours.

37
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,680
让开
Out of my way!

38
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,720
不 不 不
No! No! No!

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,520
埃尔金 救命
Elgin! Help!

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,860
法蒂玛 法蒂玛
Fatima! Fatima!

41
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,070
天快黑了
Hey, it's getting dark.

42
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,400
不找到她我不会回镇上的 爸爸
I'm not going back to town without her, Dad.

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,490
听着 埃利斯 她带走了护身符
Listen, Ellis, she took the talisman.

44
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,320
那又怎样 她不会就这么离开的
So what? All right, she wouldn't just leave.

45
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,160
我们不知道 也许她
We don't know that. Maybe she

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,080
听我说 听我说
Hey, listen to me. Listen to me.

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,200
明早我们再来找 好吗
Look, we can come back out in the morning, okay?

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,870
不 我不能让她在外面过夜
No, I'm not leaving her out here overnight.

49
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,670
你想怎么办 你难道
What are you gonna do, huh? You just gonna You just

50
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,340
你的手怎么了

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,340

Nothing. Let's just, uh

52
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,090

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,560

Okay.

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,350

我给你拿了些东西
I got you some things

63
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,760
让你能舒服一点
to help you get a little more comfortable.

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,260
埃尔金
Elgin...

65
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,550
求你放我走吧
please, just let me go.

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,310
你不是囚犯 我说过
You're not a prisoner here. I told you,

67
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,600
这是为了你好
this is for your own good.

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,150
嘿
Hey.

69
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,230
我是在保护你
I'm trying to protect you.

70
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,070
埃尔金 听我说 我看见她了
Elgin, listen to me. I saw her.

71
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,410
那个一直在跟你说话的东西 我看见她了
That thing that's been speaking to you, I saw her.

72
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,450
她说的都不是真的
What she's saying isn't true.

73
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,500
我体内的这个东西不是好东西
This thing inside me, it's not good.

74
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,000
它不会做好事的 看看蒂莉的下场
It won't do good things. Look at what happened to Tillie.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,170
那是因为孩子害怕
That happened because the baby was scared.

76
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,920
埃尔金
Elgin... It was hungry.

77
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,090
你这样是因为它饿了
You know, you weren't feeding it.

78
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,640
你没有给它吃的
Fatima, you have to stop fighting.

79
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,680
嘿 等等 等等
Hey. wait, wait, wait.

80

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,690
听我说 听着 没事的 没事的
Just listen. Listen. It's okay. It's okay.

82
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,520
坐下
Just sit.

83
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,360
你需要吃东西
You need to eat.

84
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,280
你吃得越早 孩子才会越早长大
The sooner you eat, the stronger the baby will be,

85
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,580
我们才能越早回家
and before you know it, we'll be going home.

86
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,580
所有人
All of us.

87
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,290
孩子已经帮助过我们一次了
The baby already helped us once.

88
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,460
在我发现你怀孕的那天晚上
The night I found out you were pregnant,

89
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,850
我想起了我的梦 这样能帮助博伊德救了这个镇
I remembered my dream, and that helped Boyd save the town.

90
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,060
埃尔金 不要
Elgin, no.

91
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,140
它太饿了 法蒂玛
It's so hungry, Fatima.

92
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,310
就一点点
Just a little. No.

93
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,850
求你了
Please?

94
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,020
自从我来到这里 你一直在帮我
You helped me so much since I first got here.

95
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,980
请让我帮帮你
Please let me help you.

96
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,030

No.

97
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,870
来吧 就一点点
Come on. Just a little bit.

98
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,590
看到了吗
See?

99
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,680
维克托
Hey, Victor.

100
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,350
我不想再说了
I don't want to talk anymore.

101
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,510
我明白这对你来说很难
I understand this could be difficult for you.

102
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,980
但如果你记得的事能帮助我们了解
But if what you remember can help us understand

103
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,390
现在的情况
what's happening

104
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,650
不会的 我帮不了你们
No, it won't! I can't help you

105
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,690
因为我只会让事情变得更糟
'cause all I did is make things worse.

106
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,990
怎么说
How?

107
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,530
如果不是我 她就不会走
She never would've gone if I hadn't

108
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,700
我不想再回忆了
I don't want to remember anymore!

109
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,330
维克托 别这样
Come on, Victor!

110
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,340
我帮不了你们 我谁也帮不了
No, I can't help you. I can't help anyone.

111
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,380
抱歉
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,010
刚才发生什么事了
What happened just now?

113
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,510
碰到他时你感觉到了什么 嘿
When you touched him? Hey!

114
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,350
我不 我不知道
I don't I don't know.

115
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,940

Hey, you need to you need to get out to the clinic.

116
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,350
朱莉在林子里出事了
Something happened to Julie out in the woods.

117
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,400
什么
What?

118
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,610
对
Yeah.

119
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,740
好的 请看这里
Okay, and just look right here.

120
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,530
我要检查你的瞳孔
Gonna check your pupils.

121
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,910
很好
Good.

122
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,620
她没事吧
Is she okay?

123
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,040
没看到任何外伤迹象 这很好
Well, I don't see any signs of trauma, so that's good.

124
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,870
我说了 我真的没事
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

125
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,540
看吧 不用担心 好吗
See? Nothing to worry about, okay?

128
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,630
朱莉 能再跟我说一遍
Now, Julie, can you walk me through again

129
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,760
到底发生了什么吗
exactly what happened?

130
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,430
没什么好说的
There's not much to say.

131
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,430
我们到了废墟
Uh, we got to the ruins,

132
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,480
我刚走进去 就昏倒了
I walked inside, and then I blacked out.

133
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,730
你不记得其他事了吗
You don't remember anything else?

134
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,110
我做了一个很奇怪的梦
I... I had a really weird dream.

135
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,780
就这样
That's all.

136
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,910
我建议你在这住一晚
Okay, well, I'd like to keep you overnight,

137
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,320
你觉得可以吗
if that's okay with you.

138
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,410
好 好的 没问题
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Yeah.

139
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,080
那我们给你们留点空间
'Kay, we'll give you folks some space.

140
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,960
谢谢
Thank you.

141
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,470
你和伊森在外面干什么
What were you and Ethan doing out there?

142
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,600
我很傻 我们
It was stupid. We...

143
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,100
昨天我和兰德尔去了林子
I went to the woods yesterday with Randall

144
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,610
然后我们到了废墟
and then, we got to the ruins

145
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,440
等 等 等 你说什么
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. With...

146
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,030
你和兰德尔一起去的
You were out there with Randall?

147
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,440
爸爸 事情不是你想的那样
Look, Dad, it's not like that.

148
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,650
朱莉
Julie?

149
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,280
嗨 妈妈
Hi, Mom.

150
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
怎么回事 你还好吗
What happened? Are you okay?

151
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,030
我很好 我一会就回来
Yes. Yeah, I'm fine. I'll be right back.

152
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,790
好的
Okay.

153
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,120
怎么了 你受伤了吗
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

154
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,870
没有 我只是晕倒了一下
No. I passed out a little.

155
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,290
什么叫晕倒了一下
What do you mean, "a little"?

156
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,340
没事的
It's okay.

157
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,810
天啊 来吧
Ugh! Come on!

158
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,160
兰德尔 你在里面吗
Randall, are you in there?

159
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,550
有什么事吗
Something I can do for you?

160
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,340
你和朱莉去林子里干什么了
What were you and Julie doing out in the woods?

161
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,340
她说我们在林子里干什么了
What did she say we were doing in the woods?

162
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,100
我正在问你
I'm asking you.

163
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,850
听着 如果这是你那套大家长作风
Look, if this is your version of the big bad dad routine,

164
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,430
我他妈现在没心情奉陪 明白吗
I'm not in the fucking mood, all right?

165
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,020
之前你和玛丽艾尔还有朱莉发生那事后
After what happened with you and Marielle and Julie...

166
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,190
她不愿说这件事
She won't talk about it.

167
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,240
我知道她经历了一些
And I know she's going through something that...

168
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,910
我无法理解的事 但我觉得你能理解
I cannot understand, but I figured you might.

169
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,490
我在教她开车 老兄
I was teaching her how to drive, man.

170
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,580
什么 她说她没有
What? She said she didn't have

171
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,750
考过驾照 所以我们偷了群居屋的面包车
her learner's permit, so we boosted the Colony House van.

172
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,580
我
I...

173
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,920
因为某些事情很害怕 就到了林子里
freaked out about something and we ended up in the woods.

174
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,220
那你看到的废墟呢
And the ruins that you saw?

175
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,590
听着 伙计 我不是故意混蛋
Look, man, I don't mean to be a dick,

176
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,260
但我也有自己的烦心事 好吗
but I got my own shit going on, all right?

177
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,390
你想让我解释发生了什么 我也说不清
You want me to explain what happened to us? Well, I can't.

178
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,600
对于那该死的废墟我也不知道
And I don't know about those fucking ruins,

179
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,730
但我告诉过她别再去那了
but I told her not to go back out there.

180
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,940
为什么
Why?

181
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,070
因为那里
Because they...

182
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,070
感觉就是不对劲
They just felt wrong.

183
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,070
怎么不对劲
How?

184
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,080
就是很不对劲 吉姆
They just fucking did, Jim.

185
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,290
我就知道这些
That's what I got.

186
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,120
谈完了吗
Are we done?

187
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,880
你想听我的建议吗
You want my advice?

188
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,760
开着面包车去教你女儿开车吧
Go get the van and teach your kid how to drive,

189
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,890
因为其他事你什么也做不了
because there is fuck all you can do about the rest.

190
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,940
我们谁也活不到最后
None of us are getting out of here alive.

191
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,360
我不接受这种说法
I don't accept that.

192
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,240
对你来说很好
It's good for you.

193
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,530
好吧
All right.

194
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,950
是的
Yeah.

195
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,370
保重
Take it easy.

196
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,330
我没事 我没事
I'm fine. I'm fine.

197
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,000
好了 我们得带你去诊所
All right, we need to get you to the clinic.

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,210
我说了我没事
I said I'm fine.

199
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,960
太阳要落山了
Sun's going down.

200
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,970
我得去敲钟
I gotta ring that bell.

201
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,140
好吧
All right.

202
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,390
好的 好的 爸爸 你都快走不动了
Okay. All right. Dad, you can barely walk.

203
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,470
好吗 你一点都不好 不管你怎么了
All right? You're not fine. Whatever's going on with you

204
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,520
听着 我知道我怎么了 我
Look, I know what's going on with me! I

205
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,020
什么
What?

206
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,530
该死
Fuck.

207
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,360
是的 我知道一段时间了
Yeah, I've known for a while.

208
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,580
坐下
Sit down.

209
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,080
嘿 埃利斯 埃利斯 埃利斯
Hey, Ellis, Ellis, Ellis.

210
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,830
她带走了护身符
She took the talisman.

211
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,830
不管她在哪 不管她去了哪 她都很安全
Wherever she is, wherever she went, she's safe.

212
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,880
好吗
Okay?

213
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,720
坐下 我们得谈谈
Sit down. We need to talk.

214
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,970
好吧
Yeah.

215
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,090
今晚我们在这里
We are here tonight

216
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,050
庆祝一个特别的周年纪念日
to celebrate a very special anniversary.

217
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,130
就在一年前的今天
One year ago today...

218
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,260
我们亲爱的法蒂玛来到我们身边
our dear sweet Fatima came into our lives.

219
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,720
有些人那时就在这里
Some of you were here then.

220
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,930
很多人是后来才来的
Many of you arrived since.

221
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,980
但你们都认识和了解她 都爱她
But all of you have come to know her and to love her,

222
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,400
爱她的善良和坚强
for her kindness, for her strength,

223
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,450
爱她的智慧
for her wisdom

224
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,660
还有她种的大麻
And for her weed!

225
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,500
种植技术确实是个大优点
The green thumb is definitely a big plus.

226
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,920
我们的温室从未如此芬芳
Our greenhouse never smelled so good.

227
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,250
说真的
Seriously, the truth is,

228
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,630
你让这个又大又冷的房子
you've made this big old drafty box

229
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,050
变得更像个家了
feel a little bit more like home.

230
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,850
周年快乐 亲爱的
Happy anniversary, sweet pea.

231
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,860
孩子们睡了吗
The kids asleep?

232
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,190
嗯 伊森终于睡着了
Yeah. Ethan finally conked out.

233
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,200
我本可以和朱莉待在一起
I could have stayed with Julie.

234
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,110
我们不该带伊森回房子的
We should've have taken Ethan back to the house.

235
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,530
错过这些乐趣吗 得了吧
And miss all the fun? Come on.

236
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,500
谁不喜欢睡衣派对呢
Who doesn't like a sleepover?

237
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,460
我一直做得不够好
I haven't been doing a very good job.

238
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,880
吉姆 没事的 你
Oh, Jim, it's okay. You

239
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,840
让我说完
Let me finish.

240
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,640
我知道你在试图理解这个地方
I know you're trying to make sense of this place

241
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,020
和发生的事
and what happened.

242
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,520
如果这真能带我们回家
And if there's even a chance that it could lead us home,

243
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,860
那么 我就豁出去了
then... then I'm in.

244
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,570
全力以赴
All the way.

245
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,410
不再犹豫 不再抗拒
No more second guessing, no more pushing back.

246
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,000
朱莉有事瞒着我们
There's something Julie's not telling us.

247
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,260
我知道
I know.

248
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,890
你知道多久了
How long have you known?

249
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,390
就在我和莎拉去树林之前开始的
It started just before I went out into the woods with Sara.

250
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,400
还有谁知道
Anyone else know?

251
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,030
克里斯蒂知道
Yeah. Kristi.

252
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,400
肯尼也知道
Kenny.

253
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,280
我不想让你担心
Look, I didn't want to worry you.

254
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,740
你应该告诉我 我现在告诉你了
You should've told me. I'm telling you now.

255
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,210
之前发生过这种事吗
Has that happened before?

256
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,210
什么
Wh

257
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,420
你的腿
Yeah, with your leg.

258
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,670
没有
No.

259
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,760
所以情况在恶化
So, it's getting worse.

260
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,270
看起来是这样
Seems like it, yeah.

261
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,770
还有件事
There's something...

262
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,810
我得告诉你
something else I need to tell you.

263
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,610
什么事
What?

264
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,620
在谷仓里和天真在一起时
Uh, when I was in the barn with Tian Chen...

265
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,580
他们逼我看
they made me watch.

266
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,000
他们逼我
They made me...

267
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,710
看着她死
...watch her die.

268
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,750
这一切都是个圈套
The whole thing was a set up to

269
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,300
他们说要击垮我
They said they wanted to break me.

270
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,640
天啊
Jesus.

271
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,810
如果法蒂玛和婴儿的事
What if this thing with Fatima, with the baby...

272
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,810
不 爸爸 这不是因为你
No, Dad, this isn't this isn't because of you.

273
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,520
但你不知道 你不知道
But you don't know that. You don't.

274
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,270
我们什么都不知道
We don't know a fucking thing,

275
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,110
现在蒂莉死了
and now Tillie is dead,

276
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,030
法蒂玛不知道在哪里
and Fatima is out there somewhere, and...

277
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,990
而我像个废物一样坐在这里
and I'm sitting here like a fucking gimp.

278
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,330
你在里面还好吗 博伊德
You doing okay in there, Boyd?

279
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,330
去你的
Fuck.

280
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,870
你说什么
What'd you say?

281
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,630
爸爸 别这样
Dad, no. Huh?

282
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,050
嘿 爸爸 住手 够了
Hey, Dad. Hey, no. Stop. Huh?

283
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,630
闭上你他妈的臭嘴 我操你妈
You shut your fucking mouth. Shut your fucking mouth!

284
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,390
爸爸 算了 操
Hey, come on, Dad, just Oh, you want fuck!

285
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,930
离窗户远点
Get away from the fucking window.

286
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,850
好 好 我听你的
All right, all right. All right.

287
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,720
什么
What?

288
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,730
不要
No.

289
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,190
不 住手 住手
No, stop it! Stop it!

290
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,570
不 不 不
No! No, no!

291
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,120
不 住手 住手 住手
No, stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

292
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,830
离我远点
Leave me alone!

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,250
离我远点
Leave me alone!

294
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,520
看看你
Look at you.

295
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,310
我就说只要你开始吃东西 一切就会好转
I told you when you started to eat, things would go faster.

296
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,020
宝宝很快就要出生了
The baby's gonna be here in no time.

297
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,110
你最好穿上这个
You should probably put this on.

298
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,780
你现在的衣服很快就穿不下了
Those aren't going to fit you soon.

299
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,110
希望你不介意
I hope it's okay.

300
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,990
我不得不去主储藏室
I had to go to the main storage.

301
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,330
我不敢冒险进你的房间
I didn't want to risk going into your room.

302
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,830
能扶我起来吗
Can you help me get up?

303
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,710
当然可以
Yeah. Of course.

304
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,170
啊
Aah!

305
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,170
疼
Ow!

306
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,550
不要 法蒂玛 住手
No, no! No, Fatima, stop!

307
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,800
不要 埃尔金 住手 不要 埃尔金
No! No! Elgin! Stop! No! Elgin!

308
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,140
救命 救命 救命
Help! Help! Help!

309
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,140
你不能盲目地冲出去 她可能在任何地方
You can't go out there blind. She could be anywhere.

310
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
我不能就这么待在这里
Well, I'm not gonna find her just staying here.

311
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,650
那就叫更多人来
Okay, then, we get more people.

312
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,730
组织搜救队 怎么组织
Get a search party. How?

313
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,820
唐娜马上就要告诉全镇法蒂玛做的事了
How? Donna is about to tell the entire town what Fatima did.

314
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,990
等他们听说后
You really think that people are gonna be lining up to help

315
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,150
还会有人来帮忙吗
when they hear about that?

316
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,070
我去和唐娜谈
I will talk to Donna.

317
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,240
好啊 看看结果如何
Okay, great. Let me know how that goes.

318
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,370
埃利斯 听我说
Ellis! Listen!

319
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,250
抱歉 我不是故意打断
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt,

320
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,080
但这件事等不了
but I don't think this can wait.

321
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,500
没关系 怎么了
It's okay. What's going on?

322
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,590
法蒂玛还好吗
Is Fatima okay?

323
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,420
她失踪了 对吗
She's missing, isn't she?

324
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,680
你他妈怎么知道的
What the fuck do you know about that?

325
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
不 你他妈 住手 住手
No, what the fuck do you Hey! Hey, hey!

326
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,100
够了
That's enough.

327
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,680
退后
Back up.

328
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,230
发生什么了
What happened?

329
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,190
没事的
It's okay.

330
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,110
昨晚我又听到那些声音了
I heard the voices last night

331
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,280
自废墟之后第一次
for the first time since the ruins.

332
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,370
他们说了什么
What'd they say?

333
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,540
法蒂玛不是自己离开的 是有东西带走了她
That Fatima didn't leave on her own, that something took her.

334
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,080
等等 什么
Wait. What?

335
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,460
他们想让你知道她就在附近
They want you to know that she's close.

336
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,090
她很害怕
She's afraid.

337
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,210
他们在笑
They were laughing.

338
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,470
为什么 因为
Why? Because...

339
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,470
他们知道你找不到她了
they know you won't find her in time.

340
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,600
他们想让你知道你救不了她
They want you to know you can't save her.

341
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,270
该死

342
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,790

所有这些东西
All these things...

345
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,800
我留着这些东西是因为我以为它们能帮上忙
I kept all these things because I thought they could help!

346
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,760
但它们只会带来痛苦
But all they do is hurt!

347
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,090
我要把它们都毁掉 都毁掉
I want it gone! I want all of it gone!

348
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,100

Whoa, hey. What's going on? Get out of my way.

351
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,480
除非你冷静下来
Not until you calm down.

352
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,770
我说了 别挡路
I said, get out of my way!

353
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,520

把斧子放下

我不会伤害任何人 好吧
I'm not gonna hurt anyone. Okay, fine.

那就放下斧子
Then put it down.

363
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,670
我需要它
I need it.

364
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,050
你吓到大家了
You're scaring people.

365
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,970
不 他们就应该害怕
No. They should be scared.

366
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,050
他们都不够害怕
They're no one's scared enough.

367
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,340
维克托 求你了

I was so stupid!

370
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,310

371
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,810
就 让我走吧 求你了
Just... let me go, please. Please!

372
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,480
如果你告诉我们要用斧子做什么
If you tell us what you need the axe for.

373
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,610
我要去砍棵树
I'm gonna go chop down a tree.

374
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,080
我还是回家吧
I'm just gonna go back to the house.

375
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,000
别啊 你得吃点东西
No, come on. You need to eat something.

376

377
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,840

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,920
很高兴看到这里又重新开业了
Nice to see the place up and running again.

379
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,670
嗯 有人帮了我一把
Mm. I had a little help.

380
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,680
他帮了我很多 打扫卫生和重新布置
This guy helped a lot with the cleaning and the reorganizing.

381
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,510
你要是什么时候想来帮忙

382
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,720

I could always use a helper.

383

384
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,020

00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,690
嗯
Hmm.

387
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,020
我想这里一直空着
I think it was hard for him

388
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,530
对他来说挺难受的
to see this place empty all the time.

389
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,240
在蒂莉出事之后
And after what happened to Tillie,

390
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,860
人们需要一个有生气的地方
I think people need a place that feels normal.

391
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,360
是啊 当然了
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

392
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,070
找到是谁伤害她的了吗
Did they find who did it to her?

393
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,660
还没有
Not yet.

394
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,410

Busy.

398

Come in.

400
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,890
听着 我知道你在生我的气 好吗
Look, look, I know you're upset with me, okay,

401
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,400
但是有件事
but there's something that

402
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,980
我不会说出去的
I'm not gonna say anything...

403
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,570
关于法蒂玛做的事
about what Fatima did

404
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,990
因为她对这里的人来说很重要
because of what she means to people here

405
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,410
她的精神 她的光芒
her spirit, her light.

406
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,950
我想大家接受不了
I don't think people could take it.

407
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,210
我也接受不了
I don't think I can take it.

408
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,880
她不见了
She's gone.

409
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,420
什么
What?

410
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,510
我把她关在镇外的小屋里
I had her in that shed just outside of town.

411
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,260
昨晚我和埃利斯去那里 她已经不见了
Ellis and I went there last night and she was gone.

412
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,100
她逃走了
She left?

413
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,600
莎拉听到的那些声音
Those voices that Sara hears?

414
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,940
说有东西把她抓走了
They said something took her.

415
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,110
说她就在附近
That she's close by,

416
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,280
但我们救不了她了
but we won't be able to save her before it's too late.

417
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,070
她说那些声音在笑
She said the voices were laughing.

418
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,490
该死的地方
Fuck this place.

419
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,370
敲钟吧 召集大家开会
Ring the bell. We'll call a meeting.

420
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,460
需要什么吗
What can I get you?

421
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,300
怎么 你不喜欢这些食物
What? You don't like your food?

422
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,840
我想念天真的煎饼
I miss Tian Chen's pancakes.

423
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,470
嘿 你去哪
Hey, where you going?

424
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,560
我去上厕所
I'm going to the bathroom.

425
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,230
他觉得我出事是他的错
He thinks it's his fault, what happened to me.

426
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,020
为什么会这样想
Why would he?

427
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,020
因为我问他该怎么办
Because I asked him what I should do,

428
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,900
是该进废墟还是不该进
if I should go inside the ruins or not.

429
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,860
我知道这很蠢 我只是
I know it was stupid. I just...

430
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,530
感觉这很像
...it felt so much like

431
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,830
他以前给我们讲的那些故事
one of those stories he always used to tell us,

432
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,330
我很害怕 不知道该问谁
and I was afraid, and I didn't know who else to ask.

433
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,500
别见怪 但是这种
And no offense, but this whole

434
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,080
完美家庭早餐
"perfect family breakfast" thing,

435
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,880
我知道你们想做什么 但是
I know what you're trying to do, but it's...

436
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,500
这没让事情变好
it's not making anything better.

437
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,090
反而让一切变得更糟
It's just making everything worse.

438
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,050
大家注意
Everybody!

439
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,390
来吧 快来
Come on. Come on!

440
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,390
怎么回事
What's going on?

441
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,180
不知道
I don't know.

442
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,520
请大家都到外面来一下
We're gonna need everyone to come outside a minute.

443
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
快点
Come on.

444
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,230
走吧 妈妈
Let's go. Mom?

445
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,530
来吧 怎么了
Come on. What's happening?

446
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,700
你们先去 我等伊森
You guys go. I'll... I'll wait for Ethan.

447
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,780
好的
Okay.

448
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
站好 到这边来
Fill in. Over here.

449
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,710
爸爸 你在做什么
Dad, what are you doing?

450
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,750
没事的
It's okay.

451
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,340
我们没事
We're okay.

452
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,600
过来这边
Come on over.

453
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,970
好了 大家都听着
All right, everyone, listen up!

454
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,480
关于蒂莉的事 我知道你们都很害怕
What happened to Tillie, we know you're all scared.

455
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
想要真相
We know you want answers.

456
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,570
我也想要真相
I want answers too.

457
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,900
但现在我们还不知道
But right now, we don't have them.

458
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
到底怎么了
What's going on?

459
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,820
叫大家来是因为
We called you all here because...

460
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,910
来吧 都到外面了
Come on. Everybody's outside.

461
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:46,160
我们需要你们帮忙
...look, we need your help.

462
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,240
那是
That's...

463
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,620
嘿
Hey.

464
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,750
法蒂玛失踪了
Fatima is missing.

465
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,130
什么 法蒂玛失踪了
What? Fatima's missing?

466
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,090
从昨晚开始
Nobody's, uh

467
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,470
就没人见过她
nobody's seen her since last night.

468
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,140
我们需要组织搜救队
What we're asking for is a search party.

469
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,600
把镇子的每个角落都搜遍
People to scour the town, every corner,

470
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,970
不放过任何一处 把她带回家
every crack, so we can bring her home.

471
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,520
是那个杀死蒂莉的东西抓走了她吗
Whatever took her, is that what killed Tillie?

472
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,310
我们也不确定
We don't know.

473
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,780
我对事情的来龙去脉也不是很清楚
Look, I don't have all the information on what happened.

474
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,360
我只知道她就在附近
All I know is that she's close by.

475
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,530
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

476
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,330
因为有个东西告诉我们
I know that because something here told us,

477
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,330
一个东西告诉我们
something that

478
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,710
她现在孤身一人 很害怕
that wants us to know that she's alone, that she's afraid.

479
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,800
那东西认为我们没有能力
Something that thinks that we don't have what it takes

480
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,300
找到她
to find her.

481
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,720
我不能强迫任何人
Now, look, I can't tell anybody what to do.

482
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,800
但你们看到这些了吗
Right? But you see these here?

483
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,640
这些东西不是从来就有的
We didn't always have these.

484
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,810
我刚来的时候 森林里的东西
When I first got here, those things in the woods,

485
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,310
会在夜里出来
they would come out at night

486
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,020
随意掳走任何人
and they would take whoever the fuck they wanted.

487
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,570
所有人都过着朝不保夕的日子
Everybody here was living day to day,

488
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,150
时时刻刻担惊受怕
moment to moment, hour to hour.

489
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,900
直到我们找到了这些
We found these.

490
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,660
证明了这个地方奈何不了我们
We proved that this place couldn't break us.

491
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,490
现在它又想打垮我们
Now it's trying to break us again.

492
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,000
所以你们要么躺下等死 要么
So you can either lay down and die or...

493
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,580
对它说去你的
we can say fuck you.

494
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,840
去你的
Fuck you!

495
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,920
我们要夺回自己的生活
We are taking our lives back!

496
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,050
我们一定能反抗
It's possible to fight back!

497
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,890
我们曾经证明过一次
We proved it once before

498
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,730
现在我需要你们帮忙再证明一次
and I am asking for your help to prove it again.

499
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,230
这是你们的选择
Now, look, it's your choice.

500
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,860
选择退出也无可厚非
There's no shame in backing out.

501
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,440
好吗
Okay?

502
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,900
我们该怎么做
How are we gonna do this?

503
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,410
很好 我们要
Great. We're gonna...

504
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,870
两人一组
We're gonna pair up.

505
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,080
我们所有人出去
We're all gonna go out there

506
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,710
两人一组 搜索
in groups of two, and we're gonna cover

507
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,630
这里的每个角落 明白吗
every inch of this place, okay?

508
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,090
好 好 我们开始吧 走
Okay. Okay. Let's do it. Let's go.

509
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,090
我必须帮忙 法蒂玛是我的朋友
I have to help. Fatima's my friend.

510
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,510
我也要帮忙
I wanna help too.

511
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,270
好 我带伊森去
All right. I'll take Ethan.

512
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,060
好 你带朱莉
Okay. You take Julie.

513
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,810
这样我们能搜索更多地方
We'll cover more ground that way.

514
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,400
好 没问题
Yeah. Okay.

515
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,610
小心点
Be careful.

516
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,650
你也是 来吧
You too. Come on.

517
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,450
埃利斯
Ellis.

518
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,110
嘿
Hey.

519
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,660
会有很多问题的
There are gonna be a lot of questions.

520
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,450
最好是我们中的一个人找到她
Best if one of us finds her.

521
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,330
分头行动更有机会 好吗
We've got a better chance by splitting up. Okay?

522
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,920
好
Okay.

523
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,670
嘿
Hey.

524
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,460
我们一定能找到她
We are going to find her.

525
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,590
嗯
Yeah.

526
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,670
肯尼
Kenny!

527
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,430
嗯
Yeah.

528
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,310
你愿意跟我一起去搜索吗
Hey, you mind coming out there with me?

529
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,680
当然了
Yeah, of course.

530
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,020
太好了 好
Great. Okay.

531
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,140
走吧
Let's go.

532
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,480
埃利斯
Ellis.

533
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,190
需要搭档吗
You need someone to search with?

534
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,190
需要 谢谢你
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

535
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,900
能帮上忙就好
Anything I can do to help.

536
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,020
法蒂玛 你听得见吗
Fatima! Can you hear me?!

537
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
我不明白我们在这里干什么
I don't understand what we're doing out here.

538
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,520
没人强迫你来帮忙
No one's forcing you to help.

539
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,020
如果你想回群居屋大楼
You wanna go back to Colony House

540
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,860
我不是那个意思 你看
That's not what I Look,

541
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,110
博伊德说有东西告诉你们她在这里
Boyd said that something told you guys that she was out here.

542
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,780
这是什么意思
What does that even mean?

543
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,360
那是莎拉说的
That part came from Sara.

544
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,030
法蒂玛
Fatima!

545
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,370
莎拉 那个杀人的女孩
Sara? The girl who murdered people.

546
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,910
她和这个地方有着
She's connected to this place

547
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,870
难以理解的联系
in ways that are hard to understand.

548
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,710
所以你就这么相信她的话
So, you're just gonna take her word for it?

549
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,380
如果是莎拉杀了蒂莉和法蒂玛
What if Sara killed Tillie and Fatima

550
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,960
然后编造了一些谎话
and then just made up some bullshit

551
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,260
说法蒂玛被困在森林里呢
about Fatima being held captive in the woods somewhere?

552
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,590
事情不是这样的
That's not what happened.

553
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,260
你怎么确定
How do you know?

554
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,260
我就是知道
I just do.

555
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,470
好吧 那为什么这个神奇的声音
Okay. So, then, why wouldn't this, uh, magical voice

556
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,220
不直接告诉莎拉法蒂玛在哪
just tell Sara where Fatima is?

557
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,270
或者告诉她是谁杀了蒂莉
Better yet, why not tell her who killed Tillie?

558
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,400
这不是它运作的方式 好吗
That's not the way it works, okay?

559
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,730
那告诉我它到底是怎么运作的
So, then, tell me how it fucking works.

560
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,650
你知道些什么
Okay, you know something.

561
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,650
你有事瞒着我
You know something that you're not telling me.

562
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,110
我搞不懂你们 我是个好警察
I don't understand you people. I'm a good cop.

563
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,120
如果你能让我
I can be an asset here, if you just

564
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,450
让你什么 让我给你讲解这个地方
If I what? If I walk you through the many different ways

565
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,620
会如何扰乱你的思维吗
this place will fuck with your head?

566
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,250
我没时间上这该死的课 好吗
I don't have time for a goddamn tutorial, okay?

567
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,090
法蒂玛在外面 我们必须找到她
Fatima is out there. We need to find her

568
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,800
因为她对这个镇子的人来说很重要
because of what she means to the people of this town.

569
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,930
因为她对我来说很重要
Because of what she means to me.

570
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:44,770
如果你想让我相信你是个称职的警察
If you want me to believe that you are good at your job,

571
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,350
我需要你相信我
I need you to trust me.

572
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,150
我需要你帮我
I need you to help me.

573
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,190
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

574
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,200
可以
Yeah.

575
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,950
很好
Good.

576
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,870
等这件事结束 我们再谈 好吗
When this is over, we'll talk, okay?

577
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,540
好
Okay.

578
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,000
法蒂玛
Fatima!

579
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,340
嘿 你现在住在群居屋大楼了 是吗
Hey, so, you're up at Colony House now, huh?

580
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,720
对
Yep.

581
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,220
我本来想去看看你的
I been meaning to come up there and look in on you.

582
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,470
我只是
I just, uh

583
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,300
没事 你有
It's fine. You've got, uh...

584
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,390
更重要的事要担心
You got bigger things to worry about right now.

585
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,350
是啊 总是有更重要的事
Yeah, always are bigger things.

586
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,350
是啊
Yeah.

587
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,150
嘿 肯尼
Hey, Kenny.

588
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,820
你看 我明白咱们之间
Look, I realize, uh, you and me...

589
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,570
一切都回不去了
things are never gonna be the same again.

590
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,990
博伊德 我们不用 不
Boyd, we don't have to No, I...

591
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,530
我对你撒谎了 瞒着莎拉做的事
I lied to you about what Sara did,

592
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,330
也瞒着你父亲的事 我知道你内心深处
about your Dad, and I know there's a part of you

593
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,160
永远不会原谅我
that's never gonna forgive me.

594
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,700
管理这个地方
Being in charge of this place,

595
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,170
意味着要做很多决定
it comes with a whole mess of decisions

596
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,880
都是你不愿做的
you never really want to make.

597
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,710
但是这里人们的生死
But people live and die here

598
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,670
都取决于你做决定的能力
based on your ability to make those decisions.

599
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,220
你这是要干什么
What are you What are you doing?

600
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,050
情况越来越糟了 帕金森症
So, it's getting worse. Parkinson's.

601
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,180
昨天我的腿僵住了 我几乎
Yesterday my leg froze. I almost...

602
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,140
站不起来
couldn't stand.

603
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,690
天啊 我
Jesus, I

604
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,190
我不是说今天就不行了
Look, I'm not saying it's today, okay?

605
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,070
也不是明天或一个月后
Or tomorrow or a month from now,

606
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,900
但我的时间在倒计时
but I got a clock ticking on me.

607
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,070
昨天 这倒计时变得更快了
Yesterday, that clock started ticking a little faster.

608
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,280
所以 我需要知道 等我不在了
So... I need to know that, when I'm gone

609
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,700
不 我不会 听着
No, I'm not Look!

610
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,240
我要知道当我不在了
I need to know that when I'm gone

611
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,870
或者我虚弱到什么都做不了的时候
or when I'm too goddamn feeble to do anything,

612
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,750
我需要知道你会挺身而出
I need to know that you are gonna step up

613
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,010
接手这个地方
and look after this place.

614
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,220
必须是你戴上这枚警徽
It has to be you wearing this badge

615
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,590
而不是阿科斯塔那样的暴脾气
and not some hothead like Acosta

616
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,930
或是其他可能来这里的人
or anybody else who might come through here.

617
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,560
是你
You.

618
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,190
我要确保我的家人交给可靠的人
I need to know that my family is in good hands.

619
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,440
我不会拿走你的警徽
I'm not taking your badge.

620
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,480
肯尼
Kenny

621
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,780
但是
But...

622
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,400
如果你还在找副警长
if you're still looking for a deputy,

623
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,530
我想重新当副警长
I'll take that one back.

624
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,910
可以吗
Okay?

625
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,120
当真
Yeah?

626
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,620
好啊 来吧
Yeah. Come on.

627
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,250
我们继续找人吧
Let's keep looking.

628
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,630
法蒂玛
Fatima!

629
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,270
好了 开始吧
Okay. Here we go.

630
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,370
你他妈想要什么 嗯
What the fuck do you want? Huh?

631
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,950
你以为到了现在
You think at this point,

632
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,950
我还没见够你们这些人吗
I haven't seen enough of you people?

633
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,880
换个新招吧 因为这个
Try something new 'cause this,

634
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,460
对我已经不管用了
it's not doing it for me anymore.

635
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,630
你还好吗 你在跟谁说话
You okay? Who are you talking to?

636
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,840
没人
Nobody.

637
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,630
好吧 让我换个说法
Well, let me rephrase that:

638
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,890
你以为你在跟谁说话
who did you think you were talking to?

639
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,010
亨利 我在忙 好吗 你想干什么
Henry, I'm busy. All right? What do you want?

640
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,680
这是你弄的
You did this?

641
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,980
是的 我弄的
I did, yeah.

642
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,730
我妻子在我们家院子里也做了一个
My wife made one of these in our yard.

643
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,360
你一直在跟我说这个
So you keep telling me.

644
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,820
这是做什么用的
What's it for?

645
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,490
我不知道 好吗 我只是觉得可能有用
I don't know, okay? I thought it might help.

646
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,200
你是说可能帮忙解开那些数字
Help figure out those numbers, you mean?

647
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,700
有什么我能帮你的吗
Is there something I can help you with?

648
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,910
镇上大部分人都在找那个女孩
Most of the town's out looking for that girl.

649
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,000
什么
What?

650
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,500
就是警长的儿媳妇
Uh, the sheriff's daughter in law.

651
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,420
我们开了个全体会议
We had a whole meeting about it.

652
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,710
你没听到钟声吗
Didn't you hear the bell?

653
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,760
听到了 我只是 我在
Yeah, I just, I'm

654
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,680
你在忙
You were you were busy.

655
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,720
对 没错
Right, yeah.

656
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,430
那个 你要
Um, you wanna

657
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,770
你要和我一起去找吗
you wanna come help me look?

658
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,560
听着 我想和你谈谈
Listen, I was hoping we could talk

659
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,360
维克托的事
about Victor.

660
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,590
住手
Stop!

661
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,260
你不能那样做
You can't do that.

662
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,800
这是棵邪树 它会作恶
It's a bad tree. It does bad things.

663
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,930
这很重要
It's important.

664
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,930
为什么
Why?

665
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,440
为什么它很重要
Why is it important?

666
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,400
为什么 为什么你不帮我们
Why why won't you help us?

667
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,650
因为我试过了 和克里斯托弗一起
Because I tried. With Christopher.

668
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,740
我觉得你们需要自己领悟
I think you need to learn for yourselves.

669
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,780
这是你们能明白的唯一方法
It's the only way you'll understand.

670
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,410
你现在看起来不一样了
You look different now.

671
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,330
你也是
So do you.

672
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,080
这些年 你一直都没变过
All those years, you looked the same.

673
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,250
为什么你现在变了
Why are you changing now?

674
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,630
现在一切都在变
Everything's changing now.

675
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,050
这是坏事吗
Is that bad?

676
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,600
因为我不知道该怎么办
'Cause I don't know what to do.

677
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,650
告诉我 告诉我该如何帮助他们
You tell me You tell me how I can help them.

678
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,480
求你了
Please.

679
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,780
你应该是我的朋友
You're supposed to be my friend.

680
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,450
我是你的朋友
I am your friend.

681
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,450
那就帮我
Then help me.

682
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,620
求你了 求你帮帮我 告诉我该怎么做
Please? Please help me. Just tell me what to do.

683
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,500
别砍掉那棵树
Don't cut down that tree.

684
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,130
你去哪 不 回来
Where are you going? No, come back!

685
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,010
回来
Come back!

686
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,630
你去哪里
Where are you going?

687
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,810
你知道吗 我小时候有个朋友失踪了
You know, when I was little, a friend of mine went missing.

688
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,480
说到恐慌
You wanna talk about panic?

689
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,480
整个社区的人都出动找他
We had the whole neighborhood out looking for him.

690
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,480
奶奶说不用担心 但我好害怕
Grandma said not to worry, but I was so scared.

691
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,980
结果发现他在镇子另一边的游乐场
Turns out he's on a playground on the other side of town,

692
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,570
玩得特别开心 大家都是虚惊一场
having the time of his life. Everyone was scared for nothing.

693
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,030
你觉得现在也是这种情况吗
Is that what you think this is?

694
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,910
大家都白担心了
Everybody's scared for nothing?

695
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,500
不是 我只是
No. I I just

696
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,330
我觉得有时候我们想得太坏了
I think sometimes we think the worst

697
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,040
其实并不知道真相
when we really don't know.

698
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,250
好吧 但我们知道的是我妻子失踪了
Okay, well, what we do know is that my wife is missing.

699
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,920
无意冒犯
All right, no offense.

700
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,010
我们不是在找什么游乐场里的小孩
We're not looking for some fucking kid on a playground.

701
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,050
我已经失去了我妈
All right, I already lost my mom.

702
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,760
如果法蒂玛出了什么事
If something happens to Fatima...

703
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,560
你妈妈在这里
Your mom was here?

704
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,110
她去世的时候
Look, when she died...

705
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,450
她死的那种方式
the way she died...

706
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,240
我不能再经历一次了
I can't go through that again.

707
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,410
我绝不能
I won't.

708
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,090
你觉得她会在里面吗
You think she could be in there?

709
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:18,310
谁知道呢 最好到处都找找
Well, you never know. Best to check everywhere.

710
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:24,770
而且 我觉得这里适合谈话
Besides, I think this'll be a good place to talk.

711
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,110
谈什么
About what?

712
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,780
进来吧
Come on inside.

713
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:42,080
窗户怎么了
What happened to the window?

714
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,960
不久前我们这里出了点事
Well, we had a bit of a close call not too long ago.

715
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,130
看来法蒂玛不在这里
Doesn't look like Fatima's in here.

716
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,340
我知道
I know.

717
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,470
上次你在这里时 伤得很重
Last time you were in here, you were in pretty bad shape.

718
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,100
我一直在想 "都是我的错"
And all I remember thinking was, "It's my fault."

719
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,930
"是我在开车"
"I was the one who was driving."

720
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,810
"是我没看到对面来车"
"I was the one who didn't see the other car coming."

721
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,020
我一直担心会失去你
I just kept thinking we were gonna lose you,

722
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,820
就像失去托马斯一样
right then and there, just like we lost Thomas.

723
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,530
我永远不会原谅自己
And I never would have forgiven myself.

724
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,780
但那不是你的错
But it wasn't your fault.

725
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,200
是吗 为什么不是
No? Why not?

726
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,950
因为你当时很害怕
Well, because you were scared

727
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,710
你已经尽力了
and you were doing the best you could.

728
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,830
就像你让朱莉
Kinda like you were

729
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,630
当你让朱莉进入那片废墟时
when you told Julie to go into those ruins?

730
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:33,460
你当时已经尽力了 对吧
You were doing the best you could, right?

731
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,680
大概吧
I guess.

732
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,680
听我说
Listen to me.

733
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,480
这里发生的事 我们无法掌控
Things happen here, things we can't control.

734
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,150
这个地方想让我们自责
This place wants us to blame ourselves.

735
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,030
想让我们感到恐惧
It wants us to be scared.

736
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:57,490
你要记住 我们都在尽最大努力
You have to remember that we're all doing our best,

737
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,490
即使坏事发生
even when bad things happen,

738
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:03,240
尤其是坏事发生时
especially when bad things happen.

739
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,330
重要的是我们如何面对这些事
Because how we face those things, that's what matters.

740
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,170
不是我们做出了什么决定
Not the decisions we make

741
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,420
或者该怪谁 而是我们如何互相照顾
or whose fault it was, but how we take care of each other

742
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,050
如何始终尽力而为 无论发生什么
and how we always do our best, no matter what.

743
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,550
明白吗
You understand?

744
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,680
我爱你 孩子
I love you, buddy.

745
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,220
我也爱你 爸爸
I love you too, Dad.

746
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:32,570
那我们继续找下去 好吗
So, what do you say we keep looking, huh?

747
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,110
爸爸 你在吗
Dad? Are you there?

748
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,080
爸爸 求你 别把我一个人丢在这里
Dad, please, don't leave me alone here.

749
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,200
拜托 爸爸
Come on, Dad.

750
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,130
你说得对 那不是他
You were right. It's not him.

751
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,460
不是托马斯
It's not Thomas.

752
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,890
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

753
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,470
爸爸
Dad?

754
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,560
这是什么地方
What is this?

755
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,070
维克托有时会来这里
Victor comes here sometimes.

756
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,240
我们从隧道出来那晚就在这过夜
This is where we spent the night when we came out of the tunnels.

757
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,570
她不在这里
She's not here.

758
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,160
是的
Yeah.

759
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,910
以后就会这样吗
Is this how it's gonna be from now on?

760
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:31,460
人们会一个接一个消失
One by one, people just disappear?

761
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,250
不会的
No.

762
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,630
她是第一个让我觉得这地方
She was the first person who made it seem like this place

763
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,420
或许还不错的人
might actually be okay.

764
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,420
哦 亲爱的 我们一定会找到她的
Oh, honey, we're gonna find her.

765
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,300
别担心 来吧
Don't worry. Come on.

766
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,720
我想我不是在做梦
I don't think I was dreaming.

767
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,100
什么
What?

768
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,440
当我在废墟里昏倒的时候
When I blacked out in the ruins, I

769
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,320
好像去了某个地方
it was almost like I went somewhere.

770
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:06,200
一瞬间我在这个奇怪的房间里
Like, one second I'm in this weird chamber

771
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,700
我们三个都在那里 我 兰德尔和玛丽埃尔
and the three of us are there me, Randall, and Marielle,

772
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,210
我们都在尖叫
and we were screaming.

773
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,210
然后有个人被锁在墙上
And then, there was this guy chained to a wall,

774
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,630
接着我就在这些隧道里
and then I'm in these tunnels,

775
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,470
听到你在和维克托说话
and I heard you talking to Victor.

776
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,800
我想找到你 但你的声音
I tried to find you, but your voice,

777
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,520
越来越远
it kept just getting further and further away.

778
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,060
然后我听到那些孩子
And then I heard those children.

779
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,310
他们在尖叫那个词
They were screaming that word.

780
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:39,190
安库伊
Anghkooey.

781
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:45,820
我一直在想
All I kept thinking was,

782
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,490
如果我再也回不去怎么办
"What if I never make it back?"

783
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:52,160
如果我迷失了 永远没人能找到我
"What if I'm lost and no one ever finds me?"

784
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,660
不会的
No.

785
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,210
如果我就这样孤零零一个人 不会的
"What if I'm alone now?" No.

786
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,330
我真的好害怕
I was just so scared.

787
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,590
亲爱的
Honey.

788
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,710
你不是一个人
You're not alone.

789
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,430
你永远都不会在这里孤单
You'll never, never be alone here.

790
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,220
明白吗 过来
Okay? Come here.

791
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:21,730
怎么了
What is it?

792
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,570
他们中的一个在看着我们
It's one of them watching us.

793
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:28,870
那些孩子
The children?

794
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,910
对
Yeah.

795
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,410
她在做什么
What is it doing?

796
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,040
她想让我们跟着她
She wants us to follow her.

797
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,540
去哪里
Follow her where?

798
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,880
我不知道 来吧
I don't know. Come on.

799
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,130
维克托现在的一切
Everything about who Victor is now,

800
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,880
他经历的一切
what he's been through,

801
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,600
感觉我在和一个完全不同的人重新开始
I feel like I'm starting over with a whole different person.

802
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,930
是啊 因为确实如此
Well, yeah, it's 'cause you are.

803
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,310
你为什么要跟我说这些
Look, why are you talking to me about this?

804
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:58,980
为什么不跟塔比莎说或者
Why not Tabitha or...

805
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,730
随便谁都行
I don't know, literally anybody else.

806
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:03,070
塔比莎要照顾自己的孩子
Tabitha's got her own kids to worry about.

807
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,400
别误会我的意思
And don't take this the wrong way,

808
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,160
但你让我想起了他
but you remind me of him.

809
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,660
我让你想起维克托
I remind you of Victor?

810
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,990
有点像 他一个人呆着
A little. He's off,

811
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,620
试图让一块木头讲述故事
trying to make a block of wood tell a story,

812
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,950
而你站在梯子上
and you're up on a ladder,

813
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:16,750
对着不存在的人大喊大叫
screaming at people who aren't there.

814
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,660
好吧 说得对
Okay, that's fair.

815
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,460
如果换做是你
How would it be for you

816
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,340
你父亲来这里看到你这个样子
if your dad showed up here and saw you like this?

817
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,920
你希望他对你说什么
What would you want him to say to you?

818
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,590
首先 我想知道
Well, for starters, I'd want to know

819
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:30,300
他这辈子都去哪了
where the fuck he's been my whole life,

820
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,680
但那是 听着 我
but that's, uh, that's Listen, I

821
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,100
你是想弄明白怎么修复他 对吧
You're trying to figure out how to fix him, right?

822
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,640
你做不到
You can't

823
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,600
因为他并没有坏
'cause he's not broken.

824
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,440
维克托是这个地方造就的结果
Victor is the product of what this place made him.

825
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,110
维克托在这里生存了几十年
Victor has been surviving here for decades.

826
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,660
他被这个地方塑造 他就像
He's been shaped by this place. He's...

827
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:57,290
在丛林中长大的泰山
He's Tarzan, growing up in the jungle.

828
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,290
而你就像那个出现的人
And you're the guy who comes along

829
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,710
让他觉得自己是个傻瓜
and makes him feel like an asshole

830
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,920
因为他不会用叉子
'cause he doesn't know how to use a fork.

831
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,210
这不是什么高深的事
It's not rocket science.

832
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,170
你要去哪
Where are you going?

833
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:11,180
回酒吧
Back to the bar.

834
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,180
至少在那里我能假装自己在做点有用的事
At least there I can pretend I'm being productive.

835
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,480
法蒂玛
Fatima!

836
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:24,360
法蒂玛
Fatima!

837
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,570
你知道是她带我来这的吗
You know she brought me here?

838
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,530
她是我的引路人
She was my proxy.

839
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,210
自从我来这后她帮了我很多
She helped me out a lot since I first got here.

840
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,580
她帮助了很多人
She's helped a lot of people.

841
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,210
这就是她的为人
It's what she does.

842
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,050
对你母亲的事我很抱歉
I'm so sorry about what happened to your mom.

843
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,560
别提了
Forget about it.

844
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,020
你不会失去法蒂玛的
You're not going to lose Fatima.

845
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,850
不会发生那种事
It's not gonna come to that.

846
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,230
她会没事的
She's gonna be okay.

847
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,900
求你就
Okay, would you just...

848
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,480
别说了
Just stop.

849
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,900
拜托
Please.

850
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,530
别说了
Just stop.

851
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:19,370
好吧 谢谢你能来这里
All right, I appreciate you being out here.

852
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,250
我只是不能
I just can't...

853
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,920
我有话要告诉你
I have to tell you something.

854
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,090
什么事
What?

855
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:42,140
在来这里的巴士上 我做了个梦
When we were on the bus on our way here, I had a dream.

856
