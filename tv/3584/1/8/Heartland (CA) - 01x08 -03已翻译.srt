Let's get this show on the road.

166
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,995
First of all,
where's he being housed?

167
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,120
Oh, right this way.

168
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,266
So, Dan...

169
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,537
We're not sure how this will all work out,

170
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,305
but Amy will try her best.

171
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,608
After he'd settled in,
l want to have a look around.

172
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,176
How many acres you got here?

173
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,276
600.

174
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,714
Some pretty small potatoes.

175
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,290
The sedative is wearing off.

176
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,121
He looks pretty beaten up.
Poor guy.

177
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,263
Easy.

178
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,497
lt's okay.

179
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,758
Shhh, it's okay.

180
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,567
Whoa...

181
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,841
Calm down, boy.

182
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,044
Ty.

183
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,888
'Heartland's reputation may rise or fall,

184
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,791
depending on how it manages
the traumatized stallion,

185
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,027
one of Alberta's local heroes.'

186
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,585
Rise or fall? Great.
No pressure there.

187
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,320
Don't worry about what
these hacks say. You'll be fine.

188
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,161
Hey, you don't look so good.

189
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:19,255
You wouldn't either if you'd stayed up
all night with a deranged horse.

190
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,947
Amy, uh...

191
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,819
Hey.

192
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:35,182
Can we talk?
My truck's outside.

193
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,828
So, you didn't call.

194
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:47,030
l was going to.

195
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:52,105
Gotta start somewhere, though,
don't you think?

196
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:56,142
l don't want to push you, Amy.

197
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,248
l know.

198
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,786
Can we make this for another day?

199
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,754
Lou's picking me up soon, and...

200
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,052
Okay.

201
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,491
How about Sunday? Noon?

202
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,065
We'll get a bite to eat.

203
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,967
Not here.

204
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,160
Oh...

205
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,430
A bit of a fish bowl, hm?

206
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,142
Okay, somewhere else.

207
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,242
Okay.

208
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,247
l'll see you.

209
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,050
Okay.

210
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,355
'Many have expressed surprise
that such a legend...

211
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,091
...would be entrusted to someone
so young and inexperienced.'

212
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,094
l'm sorry.
The reporter was so friendly.

213
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,064
l didn't know he'd take that kind of tone.

214
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,900
Look, in the future, l promise
l'll be way more careful.

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,902
No. ln the future, there'll be
no more interviews.

216
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:50,936
Okay.

217
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:51,837
You promise?

218
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,132
Okay.

219
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,208
So, are you worried?

220
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,308
Of course, l'm worried.

221
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,246
You think you can do anything with him?

222
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,750
l don't know. l can't get near him
when he's not sedated.

223
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,053
l've been thinking
of going to Brookland Stables.

224
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,354
Why?

225
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,514
To talk to Sam. The stable guy.

226
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,724
lt's not that far from here.
Do you think you could drive me?

227
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,635
Hi. Um... l am Amy Fleming.

228
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,312
Yeah. l remember you.

229
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,714
How's Prince doing?

230
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,873
Not so great.

231
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,185
l was hoping you could help me
with something.

232
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,754
l think it would be good if l could
get in touch with his old trainer...

233
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,522
...Ryan.

234
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,990
Ryan Bailey?

235
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,090
Yeah.

236
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,128
He left.

237
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,228
Why?

238
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,301
Look, Ryan's not in great shape.
He was burned in the fire too.

239
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,870
Real bad. And he got blamed
for what happened.

240
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,839
Why did he get blamed?

241
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,641
He was the one on duty that night.

242
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,844
Look, a lot of people think
he was the one at fault.

243
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,436
Dan Hartfield himself asked him to leave,

244
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,117
so we all just think it's best to steer clear.

245
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,053
You know, l understand
that you don't want to get involved...

246
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,621
...or anything,

247
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:19,692
but could you at least tell me where
he is, how to get a hold of him?

248
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:24,422
Please. lt's really important to me.

249
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,200
Just don't tell Dan l told you.

250
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,207
This is the place?

251
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,709
l guess so.

252
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,573
Okay. Don't be long.

253
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,220
Hi. l'm looking for Ryan Bailey.

254
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,430
Why? Who are you?

255
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,704
Come here, Prince.

256
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:15,340
Well, l'm sorry l got Amy involved.

257
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,216
l'm going to give her some time with him,

258
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,486
but l won't hesitate to tell her
when enough's enough.

259
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,796
l don't envy you that job.

260
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,859
Okay.

261
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,797
Are you busy tomorrow?

262
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,065
Depends.

263
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,602
l'm thinking of buying a horse up
in High River,

264
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,138
and l would love another opinion.

265
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,875
No problem.
For what my opinion's worth, that is.

266
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:43,542
Sure.

267
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,110
l'll come by around ten.

268
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:45,978
All right.

269
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,446
Thank you.
Thank you, Jack.

270
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,546
You're welcome.

271
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,820
Tsk-tsk-tsk. Oh, Jack.

272
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,522
Oh, what now?

273
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,424
You never say yes to the first date.

274
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,651
lt's not a date, Mallory.

275
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,195
You just watch.
lt will turn into a date.

276
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,732
Thanks for letting me come in.

277
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,392
ls Ryan around?

278
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,870
Yes.

279
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,301
But he won't see you.
He won't see anyone.

280
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,777
Why?

281
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,682
Because he's locked himself away.

282
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,751
Ryan and l were married
a year and a half ago.

283
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,342
And we were really happy.

284
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:33,125
And then that fire happened,
and things have changed a lot.

285
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,761
Do you think l could
at least speak with him?

286
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:39,319
Yeah, l guess you could try.

287
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,438
Ryan?

288
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:50,133
There's somebody here to see you.

289
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,547
Ryan?

290
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:08,081
l've come to talk to you
about Gallant Prince.

291
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,494
Sam told me where you lived.

292
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,966
Don't.

293
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,534
Don't touch them.

294
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,039
Who the hell are you?

295
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,114
You know, it's funny
that you're sitting here in the dark...

296
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,517
'cause for Prince it's the other way around.

297
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,617
He hates the dark.

298
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,997
You know,
you should come and see him.

299
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,291
He might respond to someone he trusts.

300
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,655
Someone he trusts?

301
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,696
Right.

302
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,066
Sometimes a horse
can only be reached by the person...

303
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,667
...who shares their pain.

304
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,169
That simple, huh?

305
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,466
lt's true. lt happened to me.

306
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,096
Do me a favor...

307
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,242
...leave.

308
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,246
Bev. Can you get her out of here?

309
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,185
Well, l was hoping that he'd come help,

310
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,786
but that's not gonna happen.

311
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,719
Well, it was worth a try, right?

312
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,640
How was he while l was gone?

313
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:22,293
The same. Nervous. Unpredictable.

314
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,971
lt took me an hour just to get him
out here, even with Jack's help.

315
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,506
He snaps whenever l go near him.

316
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,646
Yeah, stallions do that.

317
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,392
Who put that mare out there?

318
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,851
Watch out.

319
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,951
Ty.

320
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,087
Ow.

321
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,881
Are you okay?

322
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,161
Oh, God.

323
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,534
You know, you're a real mess.

324
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,071
Cracked ribs from the round up
and now this.

325
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,867
Hey, did you call your dad yet?

326
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,814
He called me.
And l ran into him at Maggie's.

327
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,747
And?

328
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:14,114
And he wants to go for lunch
or something on Sunday.

329
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:18,390
l don't know. lt's like l'm talking
to a total stranger.

330
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,490
Oh, he seemed okay.

331
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,760
You know, you know him better than l do.

332
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,063
Why don't you have lunch with him?

333
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,163
Just do it.

334
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,167
Ow.

335
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,495
You did it on purpose.

336
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,835
Maybe.

337
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,779
Ah.

338
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,177
Oh, my ribs.

339
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,716
Oh, that's not good. Oh.

340
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,891
AMY: No, Mr. Hartfield. He's not ready
for you to see him yet.

341
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,827
Well, there's not a lot of improvement,

342
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,590
but it's just been a couple of weeks.

343
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,331
No. That is the last resort.

344
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:06,344
Look, l just need
a little bit more time, okay?

345
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,202
All right. Bye.

346
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,849
So he thinks he's throwing away
good money.

347
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,718
That the horse should probably
be destroyed.

348
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,818
Maybe he's right.

349
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,624
Come on, Amy.

350
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,529
Some horses just can't be helped.

351
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:34,322
Well, you understand, don't you?

352
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:46,378
He's making his million dollar move
into first position to win the race.

353
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,915
He knows what he's got to do.
He's as ready as he'll ever be.

354
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,142
Can we quote you on that?

355
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,652
Yeah, yeah, l guess.

356
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:59,625
lf you're that confident, you must
have something on the race yourself.

357
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,295
Oh, l don't know.
l never gamble on Prince.

358
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,669
What?

359
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,602
You clean up nice.

360
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,674
What's the occasion?

361
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,109
He's going on a date.

362
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:17,743
A date?

363
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,038
lt's not a date.

364
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,818
Hi, everyone.

365
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,649
Hi.
- Hi.

366
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,493
Hop in.

367
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:40,088
l'm not about to be chauffeured.
We'll take my truck.

368
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,198
Your truck?

369
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,669
Okay.

370
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,038
Any horse dealer sees you roll up in this,

371
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,541
and the price automatically doubles,
maybe even triples.

372
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,446
You're probably right about that.

373
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:59,348
No way is he just going
to see a horse. He's so toast.

374
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,426
Thanks for the ride.

375
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,394
No worries. Do you want me
to come in with you?

376
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,520
No. l'll be okay.

377
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,934
Hey.

378
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,003
Good luck.

379
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,876
Ryan won't come down.

380
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:29,310
l told him about the DVD,
but he refuses to see it.

381
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,742
Can l still see it, though?
l'd like to.

382
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:39,983
He's making his million dollar move
into first position to win the race.

383
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:43,395
He knows what he's got to do.
He's as ready as he'll ever be.

384
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,656
Can we quote you on that?

385
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,732
Yeah, yeah, l guess.

386
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,471
lf you're that confident, you must
have something on the race yourself.

387
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:56,439
Oh, l don't know.
l never gamble on Prince.

388
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,090
泰是最后一个动这辆车的人
Ty was the last one to mess with this truck.

389
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,070
他肯定做了什么又离开了
He's gone and done something.

390
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,158
这告诉你不能让我开车是吧？
Well, that'll teach you not to let me drive, eh?

391
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,790
我认为你【】了
l think you've flooded it.

392
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,840
不  我没有【】它
No, l haven't flooded it.

393
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,210
好吧
All right.

394
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,310
让它休息会儿吧
Well, let's let it rest for a while. 

395
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,790
我们先把买马放一边
Let's forget about the sale.

396
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,590
我已经不能处理更多的马了
l've got more horses than l can deal with.

397
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,370
啊
Agh.

398
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,600
你饿吗？
You hungry?

399
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,600
来  我们去吃东西吧
Come on. Let's eat.

400
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,770
原本买马后我打算请你吃东西的
l'd planned a treat for after the sale. Who cares?

401
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,610
我们现在来吃吧
We'll have it now.

402
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,760
火鸡芝士三明治还是火鸡芝士三明治？
Turkey and Swiss or turkey and Swiss?

403
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,960
要火鸡芝士三明治
Turkey and Swiss.

404
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,440
这回答好
Good answer.

405
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,650
我给你准备了咖啡
l made you coffee.

406
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,150
你真是太贴心了
Aren't you something?

407
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,650
是吗？
Aren't l?

408
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,800
他是世界上最好的马
He's the best horse in the world.

409
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,900
真好
Great.

410
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,826
以上就是对英勇王子的训练师
Well, that's straight from Ryan

411
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,120
瑞安·贝利的直播采访
Bailey, Gallant Prince's trainer.

412
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:18,900
如果不是因为我他还能参赛
He'd still be racing if it wasn't for me.

413
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:21,560
这都是我的错
lt was all my fault.

414
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,786
不是这样的
lt wasn't.

415
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,986
我毁了他的生活
l've ruined his life.

416
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:30,973
瑞安  当时发生了什么？
Ryan, what happened?

417
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,026
请你告诉我
Please tell me.

418
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,506
我当时值夜班
l was on late duty, 

419
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,106
必须有一个人必须整晚看守
one of us always has to stay overnight.

420
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:49,666
所以我拿了煤油炉子进来
So l've brought in this kerosene heater,

421
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,640
然后放在走廊的中间
and l set it out in the middle of the aisle.

422
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,306
我回房的时候没有关掉它
l even turned it off when l went back to the apartment,

423
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,733
我猜肯定是部分煤油泄露了
but l guess some of the kerosene must have leaked out or something.

424
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:01,393
你知道不是这个原因
You know that wasn't it.

425
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:06,053
瑞安离开后  有人…
After Ryan left, somebody...

426
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:09,173
…有人在炉子旁堆干草
...somebody stacked hay next to the heater.

427
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,346
但是最后却全怪瑞安了
And Ryan got the blame.

428
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,610
王子离起火点很近  就在门边
Prince was closest to where the fire started, just the door down.

429
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,786
所以我跑进去  我听到他的惨叫声
So l ran in, l heard all the racket,

430
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,133
我看到他…
and l saw him...

431
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:38,066
他疼得发疯了
He was wild with pain.

432
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,146
我设法把他带了出去
l managed to get him outside.

433
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:45,544
他还回去马厩带出其他马了
He went back in the stable for all the other horses.

434
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:47,453
你做了能做的一切
You did everything you could. 

435
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,853
你还以生命犯险
You put your own life at risk.

436
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,333
我就不应该带炉子进来
l should have never brought in that heater.

437
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,693
如果我…
lf l... 

438
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,426
真不敢相信我对他造成了这么大伤害
l can't believe l did that to him.

439
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,973
我没脸见他了
l'll never be able to face him.

440
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:05,640
瑞安  王子没有怪你
Ryan, Prince doesn't blame you.

441
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,120
他很痛苦  就像你一样
He's suffering, just like you.

442
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,906
他克服不了这场火灾的阴影
He can't get over this fire,

443
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,666
但你能帮他
but you could help him.

444
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,386
我比你想象的更懂你经历着什么
You know, l know what you're going though a lot more than you think.

445
00:26:21,253 --> 00:26:23,080
我的妈妈
My mom, 

446
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:25,933
她在一场意外中去世了
she was killed in an accident.

447
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,733
我说服她去解救被虐待的马
l persuaded her to go rescue this abused horse,

448
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,213
然后回家的路上发生了车祸
and we crashed on the way home.

449
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,773
我怪我自己
l blamed myself.

450
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:46,186
我还要面对斯巴坦
And l had to face up to Spartan, 

451
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,226
就是我们救的那匹马
the horse we rescued.

452
00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:50,560
这很不容易
lt wasn't easy,

453
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,650
但最后我明白了我们有多需要彼此
but in the end l realized how much we needed each other.

454
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,546
他要是认不出我怎么办？
But what if he doesn't recognize me?

455
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,106
看我这样子
Look at me.

456
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,680
瑞安  他会认出你的
Ryan, he'll recognize you.

457
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:10,626
他会认出你的声音
He'll know your voice.

458
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,920
他会认出你的气味
He'll know your smell.

459
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,400
他会认出是你
He'll know you.

460
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:21,466
艾米  我不能去
Amy, l can't.

461
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,493
我做不到
l can't do it.

462
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,466
至少我把你送到售马所了
Well, at least we got you to your sale.

463
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,306
【】是好事  是吧？
Good thing it was just flooded, eh?

464
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,280
我很享受我们的野餐
Although, l was very much enjoying our picnic.

465
00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:54,560
嗨  你好吗？
Hi. How are you?

466
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,760
有你在好些了
Better, now you're here.

467
00:27:57,186 --> 00:27:59,940
我要看看他们要卖什么样的马
l'm just gonna go see what lot they're up to.

468
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,400
抱歉我走开一会儿
Excuse me, gentlemen.

469
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:06,680
杰克…我不知道你认识我妻子
So, Jack...l didn't know you knew my wife.

470
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,440
是啊…我认识
Yeah... l do.

471
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,790
劝说工作很困难是吧？
lt's pretty rough, huh?

472
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:35,800
他心里受伤害太重了
He's just so damaged.

473
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:38,573
就像王子一样
Just like Prince.

474
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,710
我明天必须打电话给丹·哈特菲尔德
l have to call Dan Hartfield tomorrow.

475
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:47,053
我真担心这匹可怜的马
l'm just dreading it.That poor horse.

476
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:53,893
我…不知道怎么帮他
l just...l don't know what to do.

477
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:56,620
嘿
Hey.

478
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:04,370
你知道吗？  我跟他说了妈妈的事
You know what? l told him about my mom.

479
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,533
我只是觉得可能…
l just thought that maybe...

480
00:29:10,506 --> 00:29:12,906
…我也不知道…
...l don't know...

481
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,520
只是说到这件事
Just talking about it,

482
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:23,746
带起了好多回忆
it just brought back a lot of memories.

483
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,590
来
Come here.

484
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,436
没事的
lt's okay.

485
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:43,310
没事的
lt's okay.

486
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:53,493
给你纸巾
Here.

487
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:56,066
谢谢
Thanks.

488
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,360
你要做的事很让人惊异  你知道吗？
You're amazing to do what you do, you know that?

489
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,613
没有那么夸张
Not amazing enough.

490
00:30:02,613 --> 00:30:04,625
是的  你很让人惊异
Yes, you are.

491
00:30:04,893 --> 00:30:08,226
为了说服那家伙你尝试了这么多次
You've tried how many times to get through to that guy?

492
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:14,340
我真希望能在…之前认识你
l wish l would have known you when l...

493
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:21,180
不管怎样…
Anyway...

494
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:32,346
…我以前从没见过像你一样的人
...l've never met anyone like you before.

495
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,346
从来没有
Never.

496
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,973
你知道吗  某天
You know, the other day

497
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:42,906
麦罗丽说起
Mallory was going on about

498
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,946
告诉别人你对他的真实想法
telling people how you really feel about them,

499
00:30:46,906 --> 00:30:49,470
还说到我们应该…
well, how we should...

500
00:30:53,573 --> 00:30:56,600
她从没讲过什么有意义的话  但…
She never really makes any sense anyways, but...

501
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,554
嗯…
Um...

502
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,266
…我希望你知道…
...l want you to know that...

503
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:07,226
…我会在你身边陪伴你
...l'm here for you.

504
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:10,826
听起来好逊
That sounds lame.

505
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,093
但我是认真的
l am.

506
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,346
我知道了
Okay.

507
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:18,146
你明白我的意思了吗？
Okay?

508
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,306
嗯
Yeah

509
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:37,590
我只是…
l just...

510
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:41,293
…我只是希望不要改变现在的关系
...l just don't want things to change between us.

511
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:46,653
好吧
Okay.

512
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:07,440
我说对了吧？  变成约会了吧？
l was right, wasn't l? lt was a date, wasn't it?

513
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,255
对  麦罗丽  那算是约会的一种
Yes, Mallory, it was a kind of date.

514
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,120
我早说过啦
l told you so. 

515
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,586
那你们打算什么时候再约？
So when are you guys going out again?

516
00:32:15,773 --> 00:32:18,133
我想不会这么快
l don't think anytime soon.

517
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:20,100
为什么？
Why?

518
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,173
你说像哈士奇的眼睛这事了吗？
Did you say the husky eye thing?

519
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,413
没有
No.

520
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,080
不  情况比那复杂些
No. lt's a little more complicated than that.

521
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,080
只是复杂一点点
Just a bit.

522
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:25,160
嘿
Hey.

523
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,110
嘿
Hey.

524
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,211
你好啊  伙计
Hey there, fella.

525
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,546
我们来把你清理一下吧
We're going to get you all spiffed up, huh?

526
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,440
嘿
Hey.

527
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,506
喔…
Whoa...

528
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,760
喔  嘿  镇定镇定
Whoa, hey, hey, shhh.

529
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:07,450
你喜欢刷毛的  伙计
You like being brushed, buddy.

530
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,540
喔  嘿  慢点
Whoa, hey, easy.

531
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:15,960
他从没有这么敏感不安过
He never used to be so skitzy.

532
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,150
他以前像石头一样站着不动
He used to stand like a rock.

533
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,040
他变得不一样了
He's just so different.

534
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,829
你不能指望他立刻变回来
You can't expect him to change all at once.

535
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,960
我是说这才过去几天而已
l mean, it's only been a couple of days.

536
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,169
lf you weren't here,
l couldn't get this close to him.

537
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:36,074
lt may not seem like it,
but you're making a big difference.

538
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,802
lt's just not the same.

539
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,779
Things are never gonna be
the same as they were.

540
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,789
You're just gonna to accept that.
So is Prince.

541
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:51,254
But even if things do change,
it can be for the better.

542
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,633
That's good advice.

543
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,705
lt's one o'clock.

544
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,805
So?

545
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:14,642
lt's Sunday. Your dad. Lunch?

546
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,745
Oh, God.

547
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,281
Hi, Dad. l'm so sorry.

548
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,492
l don't like being stood up.

549
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,096
l got caught up with this horse and...

550
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:35,066
Wow, l get second billing to a horse?

551
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,624
Um, we can meet after school this week.

552
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,070
You're gonna fit me in?

553
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,941
You know, maybe we could
just go for a ride.

554
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,407
Sure. Yeah.

555
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,246
Name the day. l'll be there.

556
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,746
So will l.

557
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,646
l promise. Bye.

558
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,252
Bye.

559
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,463
Come on, boy.

560
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,798
Come on, Prince.

561
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,371
Come on.

562
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,386
Hi.
- Hi.

563
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,755
Well, you say he's improved.
Show me.

564
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,085
Oh, yeah,
he's definitely coming along.

565
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,519
Oh, wow, it certainly looks like it.

566
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,298
Attaboy.

567
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,037
That's amazing.

568
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:52,039
That's amazing.
He looks like his old self.

569
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,344
Attaboy.

570
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,444
Who's that working him?

571
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,582
Ryan Bailey.

572
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,117
What's he doing here?

573
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,485
He's helping me.

574
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,121
l don't want him anywhere near that horse.

575
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,590
He's the only reason that Prince
has progressed at all.

576
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,992
l wouldn't trust my dog to that kid.

577
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,219
Dan. Dan. Wait.

578
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,931
lsn't the important part
that Gallant Prince is improving?

579
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,301
And it sounds like Ryan
is the reason for that.

580
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,870
Dan, that horse is night and day...

581
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,771
...from the way he was
when you dropped him off.

582
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,173
You're making a mistake here.

583
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,241
Mind your own business.

584
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,243
Hey, it's my business...

585
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,079
...when my granddaughter is at risk
on the count of your horse.

586
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,148
She's doing everything she can to help it,

587
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,017
and l object to you
throwing your weight around here.

588
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,020
Oh, well, my horse is leaving Heartland.

589
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,722
l'll have Sam come around,
pick him up tomorrow.

590
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:38,623
Are you coming?

591
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,750
No, l think l'll walk.

592
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,010
l apologize for yelling
at your husband. That's not my place.

593
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,203
Jack.

594
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:07,248
lf you hadn't raced off
and left me stranded at that auction,

595
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,254
not to mention l had to come back
and get my car,

596
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:14,192
l would have told you that yes,
Dan was my husband.

597
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,927
'Was' being the key word.

598
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,094
We're still my business partners,

599
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:21,756
but he's my ex-husband,
capitol E, capitol X.

600
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,969
And he can be a right jerk, and
you can tell him whatever you like.

601
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,163
The ruder the better, quite frankly.

602
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,176
Well, since men just
keep driving away on me,

603
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,980
would you mind driving me home
in your truck, please?

604
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,914
Sure.

605
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,014
Thank you.

606
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,635
You okay?

607
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,735
Yeah. l'm fine.

608
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,577
All set, then?

609
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,345
Yeah.

610
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,445
Come on, Sam.

611
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,283
Sam.

612
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,678
Hey, man. How're you doin'?

613
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,587
Not bad.

614
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,888
He's looking a lot better.

615
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:20,183
Yeah, he's coming along.

616
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:26,835
Come on, less chit chat, more action.
Let's get that guy trailered.

617
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,911
Hold him, Sam.
What is going on?

618
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,047
Sam knows.

619
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,584
Don't you, Sam?

620
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,121
Why don't you tell him
why the horse is so afraid of you?

621
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,621
l want to hear him say it.

622
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,023
Say it.

623
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,896
Whoa.

624
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:05,706
For God's sake,
get the horse in the trailer.

625
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,040
l can't, Dan.

626
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,608
Why not?

627
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,047
Because Gallant Prince
won't go anywhere near me...

628
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:16,814
...when he's not sedated.

629
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,939
That's crazy, Sam. Why?

630
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,119
'Cause l think he remembers.

631
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,245
Remembers what?

632
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:31,556
l swear, he was watching me.

633
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,925
That night.

634
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,793
He knows l'm the one...

635
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:43,062
...the one who put the hay
next to the heater.

636
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:47,167
lt was my fault, Dan.

637
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:50,007
Not Ryan's.

638
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,173
l'm so sorry.

639
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,616
l'm so sorry, man.

640
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,455
Ryan should be going with Prince.
Not me.

641
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:14,701
Put the damn horse in the trailer.

642
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,681
So, do you, um...?

643
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,784
You want the job?

644
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,923
At the Stud Farm,
do you want the job?

645
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:37,153
Yeah. l mean, totally.

646
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,491
Fine.

647
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,962
Be there Monday. 7:00 a.m.

648
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,556
'His owner, Dan Hartfield, swears...

649
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,192
...that Heartland was the saving grace
for Gallant Prince.

650
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:13,052
'They worked a miracle,' he said.
'An absolute miracle.'

651
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,566
Hey.
- Hi.

652
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,437
They even mention you.
Only they called you Tyler.

653
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,438
Great.

654
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,065
Grandpa is gonna flip when he sees this.

655
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:31,909
Hey, Amy, you know what you said to
Ryan the other day, you were right.

656
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,008
Things can change.
For the better.

657
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,322
And you shouldn't be
afraid of that, you know.

658
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,515
l know. But...

659
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:41,525
Amy...

660
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,515
...l don't want things to change.

661
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,957
l'm just afraid they might if...

662
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:55,606
...l just don't want to lose
what we already have.

663
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,706
You're not going to.

664
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:02,947
You know, you go out on a real limb
for those horses of yours.

665
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:06,532
You should try taking a chance on people.

666
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,992
So. l got all the dirt.

667
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,363
Lisa's been divorced.
Has been for years.

668
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,532
She got married to this guy
and lived in the States,

669
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,034
but when they split,
she moved back to Fairfield.

670
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:27,137
He moved back too, but they're not
together. So your path is clear.

671
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,762
That's good to know.

672
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:33,273
'Onward and upward: Life after Divorce.'

673
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,079
l know you're not the one that's divorced,

674
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,914
but the advice can work for you totally.

675
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,716
Where did you get this, Mallory?

676
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:42,486
My dad gave it to my mom,
to scare her... as a joke.

677
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,955
Bet she found that real amusing.

678
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,148
Not so much.

679
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,070
Glad you could make it.

680
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,637
l'm sorry about last time.

681
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,909
Not a problem.

682
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,715
You nervous?

683
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,417
Yeah.

684
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,576
Me too.

685
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,686
You want to just ride?

686
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,522
Sure.

687
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,699
How is that horse doing,
you stood me up for?

688
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,097
Better.

689
00:44:31,098 --> 00:44:33,098
