1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,361
Previously on "Heartland":

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,437
Can I have another one?

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,199
You're going back to New York, right?

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,570
Amy, I'm not just going back
to New York because of Carl.

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:13,043
I'm going because that's where I live.
That's where my job is.

6
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,712
I got fired.

7
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,104
What?

8
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:21,013
Do you know how hard I worked
to get there?

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,722
To get out of here?

10
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,029
He's really mad. Go get him.
I dare you.

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,566
He's coming at you! He's mad!

12
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,133
Try to grab that one.
Oh, he's coming at you, Lou.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,868
Here he comes. Oh, all right.
Coming at you, Lou.

14
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,035
No, no, don't!

15
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:45,974
Now you've done it.

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,309
Oh, my God!
Get him away from me!

17
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,215
All right.
Okay, hold him for me.

18
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,479
Hold him? No way!

19
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,387
I need both hands to make sure
he gets the whole dose in.

20
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,051
Ah!

21
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,926
Oh, my God!
He pooped on me!

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,789
Just a second more.

23
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,467
Can you hurry up, please?

24
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,932
LOU:
Aah!

25
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,202
- He pooped on me again!
- Okay, hold on.

26
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,276
Easy.

27
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,408
It's okay.

28
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,104
All right. All right.

29
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,545
All right.
All done. You can let him go now.

30
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,487
It's okay, Lou.

31
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,949
Only three more to go.

32
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,527
Yeah, I would like to thank you
for reminding me

33
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,994
why I left here in the first place.

34
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,329
No problem.

35
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,128
Scott vetted him at the rescue center.
He's perfectly sound.

36
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:50,273
Decent bloodlines.
He's even got a name. Pirate.

37
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,338
So, what's the problem?

38
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,744
Well, he doesn't stop
when you pull him up.

39
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,546
And he doesn't go forward
when you kick him.

40
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,445
And he doesn't neck rein.

41
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,484
He must be good for something.

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,524
Well, I was hoping to ask
our friendly neighborhood vet,

43
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,288
but it seems like he's got himself
tied up de-worming geese.

44
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,397
Gross!

45
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,625
I've never seen Lou get down
and dirty with a goose before.

46
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,137
Hey, who's the dude?

47
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,242
I don't know.
Must be a tourist.

48
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,936
- He looks like an oil man.
- I'm betting real estate developer.

49
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,703
Maybe Lou knows him.

50
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,981
Here we go.

51
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,921
Oh, my God! Carl!

52
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,524
Figure she might.

53
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,853
# And at the break of day #

54
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:23,299
# You sank into your dream #

55
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,497
# You dreamer #

56
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,440
# You dreamer #

57
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:36,978
# You dreamer #

58
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,519
I can't believe this.
Why didn't you call?

59
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,185
Are you kidding me?
And lose the element of surprise?

60
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,285
Look at you. I would not have missed
this for the world.

61
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,227
You came all the way from New York
just to make fun of me?

62
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,995
No, no. I got a new job. In Chicago.

63
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:56,863
Chicago?

64
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,699
Yes, I gave the New York office
my notice.

65
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,673
It is a huge, huge bump up for me,
Lou.

66
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,277
It's everything
that we used to talk about.

67
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,604
It seems like such a long time ago.

68
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,140
Well, not for me, it doesn't.

69
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,048
Why do you think I'm here?

70
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,642
I don't know.
A sudden interest in the wild west?

71
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,160
Do you really have to ask?

72
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,893
No. I guess not.

73
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,932
Mmm...

74
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,703
Take a shower.

75
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,945
Hey, Scott.
Aren't you staying for dinner?

76
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,608
Uh, I forgot,
I have another appointment.

77
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,015
Tell Lou I'm sorry.

78
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,920
What about Pirate?

79
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,114
Oh, yeah.

80
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,986
[Clears throat]

81
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,720
I'll see if I can find out
where he came from.

82
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,162
I can't believe I haven't picked up
on this before.

83
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,167
Picked up on what?

84
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,999
All the signs are totally there.

85
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,197
Scott's in love with Lou,

86
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,672
and he's secretly devastated

87
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,006
about the arrival
of the New York boyfriend.

88
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,205
...with stock options.
They paid my moving expenses.

89
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,217
They gave me a great corner office
with a killer view.

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,513
It's a total no-brainer.

91
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,917
This new job in Chicago,

92
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,455
it wouldn't happen to be
with Griffin & Sharpe, would it?

93
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,855
Yeah, yeah.
How'd you know that?

94
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,722
Well, it's probably
just a coincidence.

95
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,125
But I got a letter in the mail
from them

96
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,753
asking me to interview
for a position.

97
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,560
Oh, cool.
So, what'd you tell them?

98
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,363
Well, I didn't take it seriously.

99
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,698
Well, maybe you should have.

100
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,239
It's not like, uh, you've got a job
in New York anymore.

101
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:46,977
Yeah. I guess I should've seen
that coming, eh?

102
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,740
So did anyone say anything?

103
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,542
Mmm.

104
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,618
Come on, Carl. I know the drill.
First you get fired.

105
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,447
Then you get trashed.

106
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,282
Which is why you should
probably consider Chicago.

107
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,386
It's a happening firm.
You'd fit right in there.

108
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,951
I'm kinda working here right now.

109
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,325
Yeah, on the family farm?

110
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:11,427
It's, uh, it's quaint. But, frankly,
I don't really see you as a farm girl.

111
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:15,405
There you are. Scott just left.
I thought he was staying for supper.

112
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,738
Grandpa, you finally get to meet Carl.

113
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,738
Carl, this is my grandfather,
Jack Bartlett.

114
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,915
Well, the New York boyfriend.
Good to meet you.

115
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,075
Heard a lot about you, Jack.

116
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:31,686
Looks like you got a bit of the mother
ship stuck to your ear there, Carl.

117
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,851
Which reminds me.
I left my laptop in the rental.

118
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,998
Uh, you don't have to lock
your car here, Carl.

119
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,724
How long is he staying?

120
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:42,994
Just a couple days.

121
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,832
I figure since Ben's away at a show,
we could put him in here.

122
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,301
In your mother's room?

123
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,602
Yeah.

124
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:56,240
Well, that's, uh, the room that butts
right up against, uh, your room.

125
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,110
Are you kidding? Give your big shot
New York boyfriend my room?

126
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,417
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

127
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,517
And where am I supposed to go?
Sleep in a stall?

128
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,823
Pitch a tent out in the yard?
Curl up in the manure pile?

129
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,692
No one said anything
about kicking you out.

130
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,397
No way!

131
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:23,333
Well, that's about it.
Thanks for your help.

132
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,435
Which bed is mine?

133
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,140
You're over there.

134
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,182
Perfect.

135
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,655
Just perfect.

136
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,853
All right.

137
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,023
Do you have WiFi here?

138
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,695
Nope. You'll have to downgrade
to dial-up.

139
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:54,964
Where's your phone jack?

140
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,239
I think there's one in the house.

141
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,011
Hey, cowboy.
We both know this sucks.

142
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,840
Personal issues aside,
I get a ton of e-mail.

143
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,215
I'm going to need
internet connectivity here.

144
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,354
Trust me. You're sleeping
over a barn full of horses,

145
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,255
your internet connectivity
is the least of your problems.

146
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,162
No, thanks.

147
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,895
You know,
I saw a lot of oil wells,

148
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,597
a lot of gas wells,
on the drive up here.

149
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,573
They're all over the place.
Frankly, I'm a little surprised.

150
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,109
Jack, as Lou knows,
you're sitting on a goldmine here.

151
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,303
Well, this outfit's been
in our family for six generations.

152
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,439
We don't look on it
as an investment property.

153
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,210
No, I'm not talking
about selling the farm.

154
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,979
I'm talking about commodifying
the mineral rights and just hook up

155
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,076
with the oil companies...

156
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,850
Heartland is our home, Carl.
It's a, it's a horse ranch.

157
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,319
All right. Well, you just re-purpose
a couple hundred acres off

158
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,451
in some lost corner of the ranch.

159
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,156
You'd never even know.
It's a developer's dream.

160
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,424
I've heard it all before.

161
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,191
Heartland Estates...

162
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,096
A million times.

163
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,726
Better yet,
Heartland Executive Estates.

164
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,702
Might even buy in myself.

165
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,706
So, Carl, um, have you ever been
around horses before?

166
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,969
Yeah, sure, when I was younger,

167
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,738
my parents took me out
to Dude Ranch

168
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,143
every summer in Arizona.

169
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,179
Dude.

170
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,582
So great, um, maybe you and Mallory
could take Carl on a trail ride, Amy.

171
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,921
I've got a lot of work to do, Lou.

172
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,091
But sure.

173
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,127
Have you been around horses lately,
Carl?

174
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,958
No. But it's like riding a bicycle,
right?

175
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,691
Once you learn, you never forget.

176
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,197
So your friend Carl sure
has a lot of good ideas

177
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,970
about how this place
can make more money.

178
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,602
I know he comes off
a bit corporate at first,

179
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,840
but once he settles in
you'll see what a fun guy he is.

180
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,281
Settles in?
How long is he staying?

181
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,578
Just a couple days.

182
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,687
He's got a new job in Chicago
that starts next week,

183
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,779
so you can cool it with the attitude.

184
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,692
Are you planning on going with him?

185
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,887
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

186
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,657
Not necessarily.

187
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,832
Four boxes of cake mix?

188
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,598
How many birthday cakes
are you planning on making?

189
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,764
Just the one.

190
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,806
The others are for insurance,
in case the first one's a flop.

191
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,640
When it comes to grandpa's birthday
cake, failure is not an option.

192
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,590
You know, works starts
pretty early around here.

193
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:31,629
Yeah? I'm on vacation.

194
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,596
Hello?

195
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,804
Yeah, I'll be right there.

196
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,539
All right.

197
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,283
Look, I don't want to tell you
what to do, but...

198
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,255
Never mind.

[Dog barks]

201
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:23,439
I see you just accidentally
triggered our alarm system there.

202
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,950
Yeah, it's surprisingly efficient
for such a low-tech security solution.

203
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,850
Well, most of the time
it works real good.

204
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,549
But if it doesn't,
there's always backup.

205
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,283
More ducks?

206
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,059
They're geese.

207
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,959
Just testing, Jack.

208
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:45,698
The thing is, Carl, the older you get,
the lighter you sleep.

209
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:49,840
You know, a foot steps on the porch,
a screen door slams,

210
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:54,204
a bed spring squeaks.

211
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,803
You get my drift?

212
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,115
How's the vacation going so far?

213
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,690
Oh, my God!
They're wearing matching outfits!

214
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,027
So what?

215
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,396
It's one of those signs.

216
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,960
You don't see it very often,
but when you do, it's serious.

217
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,905
They're not matching.
They're just both in black.

218
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,270
They're from New York.

219
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,742
So, Amy, in terms
of prioritizing your schedule...

220
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,682
Hmm... Prioritizing?

221
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,119
I think what she means is,
what are you going to do first?

222
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,715
I just need some feedback
on the horses' progress

223
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,259
so when I touch base
with the clients...

224
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,453
Wait. Where are you going?
I haven't finished yet.

225
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,665
I'm just doing some prioritizing
of my own.

226
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,132
Ty?

227
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,725
I'm just doing
whatever he tells me to do.

228
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,464
If you're looking for something
to prioritize,

229
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,869
we're running low on alfalfa cubes.

230
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,999
That's why we have a schedule, Amy.
We make orders on Monday a.m.

231
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,237
You have a schedule?

232
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,747
Yeah, Lou's got it all figured out.
That's why we're running low on feed.

233
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,818
I'm going into Hudson anyway. But I
was thinking of switching to pellets.

234
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,381
Mom never used pellets.

235
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,489
They're half the price of cubes.

236
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,386
Oh, it's useless to argue
the bottom line with Lou.

237
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,423
Trust me, I've tried.

238
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,891
It's not about money.

239
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,862
Everybody knows that pellets
aren't half as good as cubes.

240
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,001
You see what I have to deal with
every day?

241
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,400
Maybe you should take that interview
with Griffin & Sharpe.

242
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,436
Chicago's a great town.

243
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,531
Yeah. But I'm not going
to Chicago, Carl.

244
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,769
I'm going into Hudson
with my grandpa.

245
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,037
And I was kind of hoping
you'd come with us.

246
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,444
Oh, no, I drove through Hudson
on my way in from the airport.

247
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,212
And I saw everything that there is
to see in about 30 seconds

248
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,344
that it took me to get from one end
of the town to the other.

249
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:48,723
That's including the full stop that
I made at the city's one stop sign.

250
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,021
I just... I hate the way Lou acts
like the CEO of Heartland

251
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:53,996
when Carl's around.

252
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,794
Just be happy
you're not bunking with him.

253
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,391
At least you don't have to go riding
with him.

254
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,064
He spent 15 minutes on a dude ranch
when he was 12.

Of course.
Verbal signals.

This horse is trained
to respond to verbal signals.

Oh, so, you know how to make him
stop. How do you make him go?

Um...

I've got too many damn shirts
as it is.

There's got to be something here
you want.

bought a couple boxes of cake mix.

A nice piece of birthday cake
after a meal with my family,

wouldn't refuse that.

All right, Lou, your order of cubes
is ready out back.

I thought I ordered pellets.

Oh, I figured it was a mistake.

281

I mean, your mom
never cheaped out on feed.

I always recommend the cubes.

287
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,957
I got some literature
back at the clinic,

288
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,629
if you're interested in voluntary
feed intake and nutrition statistics.

289
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,038
Sounds fascinating, but I'm gonna
have to take a rain check.

290
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,610
I'll just take the cubes.

How about tomorrow?
She's gonna make a cake.

Oh, I'm up at Sheep River.

Uh, I, I gotta do
all this vaccinating,

and I don't think I'll be half done
by dinner.

00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,557
Too bad about Carl, though.
How long is he staying?

That's what everyone
seems to want to know.

Yeah, they call it Big Sky Country.
I don't know.

301
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,208
Probably because there's
not much else to see up here.

302
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,806
Yes, yes, I'm talking up
the situation with Lou.

303
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,115
It's just that I gotta proceed
with a bit of caution here.

304

If she ever found out that I set
the entire thing up, she'd freak.

You're gonna owe me
big time on this.

Yes. Hello?

00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,081
who claim
they can ride a horse can't?

318
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,319
I'm part of the one percent who can.

319
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,988
Still, everybody can use
a refresher course.

320
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:16,227
Luckily, I'm a good teacher.
And affordable. Ten dollars an hour.

321
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,793
I'll tell you what,
you want to make some cash?

322
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,369
Why don't you run
and get my battery charger?

323
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,271
It's in my computer case.

324
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,038
Wow! A whole dollar!
Whatever you say...

325
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,005
...dude.

326
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,012
How long's that guy Carl staying?

327
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,852
Don't worry. He'll be outta here
before you know it.

328
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:40,982
What makes you so sure?

329
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,423
Well, he's got a job in Chicago...

330
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,428
So does Lou!

331
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,257
What?

332
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,789
I heard him talking
about how they owe him

333
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,889
for setting this whole thing up.

334
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,935
It's pathetic what people will do
for money.

335
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,568
Mallory, wait.
Where are you going?

336
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,876
I'm going to get Carl's phone charger.
He's paying me a dollar.

337
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,671
A whole dollar.

338
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,707
It's worse than we thought!

339
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,841
- Where did you get that?
- Carl's computer case.

340
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,919
You were snooping?

341
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,680
You can thank me later.

342
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,545
You put that back right now.

343
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,092
Fine. I just thought
maybe you'd be interested.

344
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,252
Wait!

345
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,697
Can I see it?

346
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,506
What are you doing in here?

347
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:11,914
Stuff.

348
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,679
What kind of stuff?

349
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,618
I'm running an errand for Carl.

350
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,920
I'm getting his battery charger.
He's paying me.

351
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:21,822
How much?

352
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,519
A dollar.

353
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,029
Hmm, it's out of my price range.

354
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,390
Too bad.

355
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,331
I was gonna ask you
to help me turn out the horses.

356
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,665
Doesn't Amy usually do that?

357
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,438
Yeah. But I figured
you could handle it.

358
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,204
Wait, Ty! I'll do it!
It won't even cost you a cent!

359
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,786
Lou, when you left the firm
to go run the family business,

360
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,884
I didn't realize that baking cakes

361
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,554
was an integral part
of the job description.

362
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,567
I know it might seem old-fashioned,
but it's a tradition in our family.

363
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,863
Grandpa doesn't like a fuss.

364
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,404
But he does like a piece of cake
on his birthday.

365
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,268
Does he like it rare,
medium or well-done?

366
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,974
Oh, my God!

367
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,008
Oh!

368
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,808
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ahh...

369
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:24,618
Luckily, I have insurance.

370
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,256
Jack.

371
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,304
Can I have a word with you?
Mano a mano.

372
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,866
What's on your mind, Carl?

373
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,101
This place Heartland
is one hell of a ranch.

374
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,939
And I can see it means
the world to you.

375
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:52,005
But I know Lou. She's... She just
doesn't belong here anymore.

376
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,946
She's got an MBA, Jack.

377
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,715
It doesn't take an MBA
to run a horse ranch.

378
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,791
Well, they don't run themselves, Carl.
Cut to the chase.

379
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,362
Appreciate your candor,
and your family values,

380
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,091
and the manner in which
you cling to tradition...

381
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,099
...which is why I thought it best

382
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,637
that I should ask you first for your
granddaughter's hand in marriage.

383
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,242
Well, like you say,
Lou's a modern woman,

384
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,834
and she'll make up her own mind

385
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,437
whether she wants
to marry you or not.

386
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,407
Yeah.

387
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,381
No matter what I think about it.

388
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,695
I'd love to stay and help,
but I've got to work with Pirate.

389
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,098
How's it going with him?

390
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,295
Good.
I'm beginning to figure him out.

391
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,099
Uh, great.

392
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,799
So, hey, remember how you said
you'd take Carl on a trail ride?

393
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,474
Lt'd be good if you could do it
before he left.

394
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,545
Well, you know, trail rides
can be pretty romantic.

395
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,079
Why don't you take him?

396
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,113
Who's gonna make this cake?

397
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,341
I'll make it.

398
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,714
Okay, shut up. I don't want him
to see I'm afraid of horses.

399
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,480
What difference does it make?

400
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,248
There aren't a lot of horses
in Chicago.

401
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,051
What are you talking about, Amy?
I'm not going anywhere.

402
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,354
You do like him, though?

403
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,795
Obviously, I like him.
He's a lot of fun.

404
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,021
Fun? Really?

405
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,193
We had a lot of fun working together
in New York. You know?

406
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,237
It's something I miss.

407
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,739
Are you in love with him?

408
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,747
It's not that simple, Amy.
You think it is, but it's not.

409
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,079
Why? I mean, either you are
or you aren't.

410
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:42,020
Things were different in New York.
It was like, we were both...

411
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,454
It was like we had the same...

412
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,760
Could you please just take him
on a trail ride, Amy?

413
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,966
He's only here
for a couple more days.

414
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,103
Would it be that hard for you
to be nice to him?

415
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,867
Okay.

416
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,184
I saw your truck
parked out front there.

417
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,278
Wednesday. Vegetarian chili.
I wouldn't miss it.

418
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,152
Coffee?

419
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,226
Ah, no, honey, I can't stay long.

420
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,194
Well, Lou's been doing
some delegating.

421
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,821
I got stuck with the shopping.

422
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,194
I guess she's busy.

423
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,098
Her boyfriend from New York.

424
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,798
- How long is he staying?
- Long enough.

425
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:36,378
So maybe you can pass this
on to Amy, save me the trip?

426
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,041
Red Rodeo Cowboy Girls?

427
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,018
I did some research
on that rescued horse.

428
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,214
Picked up a saddle too.
It's back at the truck.

429
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,655
Well, I think this might be something

430
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,991
that you might want to give
to her yourself.

431
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,025
Another time, Jack.

432
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,905
Do you remember
a couple of years back,

433
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,373
we were bringing calves
to be doctored up

434
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,876
at Travis Cooley's place there?

435
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,379
Travis Junior was chasing
that runaway,

436
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:15,283
he built his loop, tossed it perfect,
the calf zigged, his horse zagged,

437
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,116
and his rope slips off.

438
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:20,016
Junior, he dove right off his horse,

439
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,356
grabbed that calf's tail and got
dragged all over hell's half acre.

440
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,294
But at the end of the day...

441
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:31,334
Dislocated shoulder. Broken nose.
Various cuts and abrasions.

442
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,903
You're missing the point there, Scott.

443
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,872
I got the point.
He never gave up.

444
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,243
Did I mention it's my birthday?

445
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,486
And how I'll be mighty disappointed
if you're not sitting at the table,

446
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,960
eating that cake that Lou
has tried so hard to bake.

447
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,395
You know, the commands
are right out of an old western.

448
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,869
Git along, giddy-up, whoa.

449
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,667
So how does he gallop?

450
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,901
I haven't got there yet. Maybe I need
to watch a few cowboy movies.

451
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,138
I think I'm watching one right now.
Check out the Dude.

452
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,173
This will be fun.
Howdy there, partner!

453
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:25,579
Howdy. So, which one of these
here critters is mine?

454
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:26,782
Not so fast, Carl.

455
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,120
I've never seen you ride before,

456
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,784
so we're just gonna
go on a walking trail.

457
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,456
Single file, you stay behind me.
And you need to wear a helmet.

458
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,194
None of you guys
are wearing helmets, so...

459
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,963
Here's your helmet.
This is your horse.

460
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,732
This is my horse.
Oh, come on, guys.

461
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,105
I was kinda hoping to have something
with a little more spark, you know?

462
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,710
Like maybe that one.

463
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,439
Pirate? No.
Definitely not for beginners.

464
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:54,410
All right. I'll wear your helmet,
but I am not gonna ride this nag.

465
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,714
Come on, it looks like you could
set a bomb off next to his head,

466
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:57,515
he wouldn't even blink.

467
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:58,953
This isn't a dude ranch, Carl.

468
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,025
I can't risk letting you get up
on a horse you can't handle.

469
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,559
I can handle.

470
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,257
Amy!

471
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,921
Come here.
I want to show you something.

472
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:12,697
Look. Either you ride this horse,
or you don't ride at all.

473
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,297
All right.

474
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,240
Hey, Grandpa, can it wait?
I gotta take Carl on a trail ride.

475
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,040
You just take a look at this.

476
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,808
Wow, it's beautiful.

477
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,680
Scott found that at a yard sale.

478
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,051
It's in really good shape, but it's
a trick riding saddle, Grandpa.

479
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,646
What am I gonna do with that?

480
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,590
That's the thing.

481
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,827
Take a look at this.

482
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,329
- It's Pirate!
- Yeah.

483
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,697
Well, that makes perfect sense!
He was a trick riding horse!

484
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,141
Hey, what are you doing?

485
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,211
Don't worry.
That horse isn't going anywhere.

486
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,906
Yee-haw!

487
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,646
Ahhh! Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

488
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,778
Yee-haw! Who knew?

489
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,985
Come on, let's go!

490
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,867
Ahhh! Ahhh!

491
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,417
See? I told you I knew how to ride!
Woo, hoo!

492
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,015
Whatever you do, don't say...

493
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:42,984
Whoa! Whoa!

494
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,691
Are you okay?

495
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:53,730
Uh, yeah, never better.
Why do you ask?

496
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:02,205
Ah, it's, uh...

497
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,053
Come on, buddy.

498
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,853
What are you doing?

499
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,230
Fall off a horse,
gotta get right back on, right?

500
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,938
Upsy-daisy!

501
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,837
Well, he rears on command too.

502
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:44,445
I've got some arnica back at the barn.
It's good for superficial wounds.

503
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,456
Thanks.
I, uh, appreciate the offer.

504
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,654
I was kinda hoping to show
your sister my cuts and bruises.

505
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,019
[Laughs]

506
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,620
I guess that's a sign of true love,

507
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,600
when you're willing to kill yourself
in order to score some points.

508
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:01,069
True love? What are you,
the family romantic?

509
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,664
No. I'm just trying to figure out
why you and Lou hooked up.

510
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:08,644
Are you kidding me?
We make a great team.

511
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,977
Yeah, I can sort of see it.

512
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,448
I mean, Lou's pretty pushy

513
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,917
when it comes
to the business end of things.

514
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:22,482
You say pushy. I say she's driven.
She's energetic. She's focused.

515
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,959
I mean, come on, Amy.

516
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,030
Filling out feed orders
and making schedules

517
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,621
that nobody pays attention to.

518
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:31,065
Baking cakes?
A trained monkey could do all that.

519
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,005
Meanwhile, Lou's career
is on hold indefinitely.

520
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:35,902
Oh!

521
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:39,704
So is that why you're here?
To take Lou away from all this?

522
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:43,507
Seriously, Amy. Don't you want
your sister to be happy?

523
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,517
Yeah.
That's exactly what I want.

524
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,585
Scott!
You've gotta help me with this.

525
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,218
I don't know how my mom did it.

526
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,723
Your mom had a trick, Lou.

527
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,165
Everybody loved her icing.

528
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,338
And here's why.

529
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:12,876
My Mother used icing from a can?
That is genius!

530
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,575
If only the rest of life
was this simple.

531
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,113
You know, Lou, Jack invited me
here for his birthday dinner,

532
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,620
but really I came here
to talk to you.

533
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,248
Uh-oh. Last time you wanted
to talk to me,

534
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,349
I ended up getting drunk
and singing karaoke.

535
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,560
And crying.

536
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,431
And crying.

537
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:37,792
So how long is it gonna take for you
to get to the point this time?

538
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,067
What are you talking about?

539
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:39,932
Oh, come on.

540
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,595
You beat around the bush for weeks

541
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,901
before you finally told me
you were taking off to vet school.

542
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:44,497
And what about you?

543
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,837
You didn't even tell me you were
planning to move to New York.

544
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:47,434
That was different.

545
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:52,346
I knew you would try to talk me
out of it, so I couldn't tell you.

546
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,413
Well, that's sort of
where I'm at now.

547
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,052
Oh, my God, Carl!
Are you all right?

548
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:07,590
Yeah, I need, um, medical attention,
honey. Lots of medical attention.

549
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,165
What happened?

550
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,632
Let's just say that, um,

551
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:15,068
I'm thinking of giving up investment
banking and joining the rodeo.

552
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,639
You got thrown?

553
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,173
Twice.

554
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,436
Aah...

555
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,239
I should've left well enough alone
after the first time,

556
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,314
but I got back up.

557
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,678
And all I said was the magic word,
and voila,

558
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,648
he behaves like a circus horse.

559
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,044
You rode Pirate?

560
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,851
In a manner of speaking, yes.

561
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:39,055
He's a trick horse. He used to ride
with the Red Rodeo Cowboy Girls.

562
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,529
A trick horse?

563
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,063
Git along.

564
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,769
Giddy-up.

565
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,253
LOU:
Amy!

566
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,950
You know, I know you don't like Carl,

567
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,651
but you didn't have to try
to kill him!

568
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:14,730
I warned him not to ride Pirate.
I tried to stop him.

569
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,823
Well, maybe you didn't try very hard.

570
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,595
He wouldn't take no for an answer.

571
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,001
If you think I deliberately tried
to put a rider in danger...

572
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,629
Well, what else
am I supposed to think?

573
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,632
You know what, maybe you
should take that job in Chicago.

574
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,370
There is no job in Chicago.

575
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,208
Oh, yeah? Why don't you ask Carl?
He's the one who arranged it for you!

576
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,840
You don't even know
what you're talking about, Amy!

577
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,486
Scott!

578
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:40,421
You leaving so soon?
I thought you were staying for dinner.

579
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,298
Never mind.

580
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,364
Happy birthday, Jack.

581
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,100
Appreciate it.

582
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,309
Kinda wish I was going with you.

583
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:15,686
That was delicious.
If you'll excuse me.

584
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,318
Grandpa, wait.
There's dessert.

585
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,288
Really?

586
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,491
I'll get it.

587
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,199
Excuse me, people.

588
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,876
I'd just like to take this opportunity
to say a little something

589
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,878
about a very special person.

590
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,607
In the days since you have, uh,
welcomed me into your home,

591
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,846
thank you for that, I have come
to appreciate just what goes

592
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,583
into running a ranch like this,
and how it's all about family.

593
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,455
I thought I said no fuss.

594
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,256
Needless to say, you all, and this
was the farthest thing from my mind

595
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,888
when I first met Lou
at the Strickland & Cook lunch room,

596
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,466
and I knew right away

597
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:03,632
that I had to get to know this totally
hot and funny and intelligent and...

598
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,972
...spunky and forthright
and beautiful young woman.

599
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,207
And did I mention hot?

600
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,113
Please, Carl, sit down and shut up.

601
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:23,823
Samantha Louise,
will you marry me?

602
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,191
Uh, Carl...?

603
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,632
# Happy... #

604
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,824
Oh, my God!

605
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,606
Mallory! You put it back
like I told you, didn't you?

606
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,232
I meant to put it back.
I tried to put it back...

607
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,004
but I couldn't put it back,
and then I forgot to put it back!

608
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,112
Where is it now?

609
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:42,702
I don't know!

610
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,543
Think. Where was the last place
you had it?

611
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,178
In my riding pants pocket!

612
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:47,876
And where are the pants?

613
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:48,974
At home.

614
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,213
In the laundry!

615
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,856
I never took it out of the box.

616
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,431
Well, it's gotta be
here somewhere, Carl.

617
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,226
Always the optimist.

618
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,631
Well, it didn't just walk out of here.

619
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,870
No. At least not under its own steam.

620
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,641
Hey, that's my stuff.

621
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,542
Yeah. So you say.

622
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,548
Oh, I get where this is going.

623
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,316
I didn't take your lousy ring.

624
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,978
No one is accusing you
of anything, Ty.

625
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,991
Yeah, right.

626
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,992
I'm really, really sorry.

627
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,337
Well, the important thing is,
you brought it back.

628
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:46,502
It went through the washer,
but I think it's still okay.

629
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,703
No harm done.

630
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,977
It's a really nice ring.

631
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,811
I mean, my dad gave my mom
a semi-precious stone.

632
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:57,253
It was actually a mood ring,
but they still got married.

633
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,813
Even though it stayed black
for the entire engagement.

634
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,019
You can go now, Mallory.

635
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,579
Well, uh, so much
for the surprise factor,

636
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,116
but since practice makes perfect...

637
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,382
Lou Fleming, will you marry me?

638
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:36,257
Oh, my God, Carl,
it is so beautiful.

639
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,124
Just like you.

640
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:41,965
Wow.

641
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,898
I don't know what to say.

642
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,332
Yes...?

643
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,134
I know. You are overwhelmed,
but trust me, Lou,

644
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,873
this is going to be amazing.

645
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,777
We can be in Chicago
by tomorrow night and...

646
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,817
Tomorrow? That's so fast.

647
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:01,850
Yeah, but you gotta have
enough time

648
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,614
to prepare for your interview
on Thursday, right?

649
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,416
Thursday?

650
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,525
How did you know they want
to interview me on Thursday?

651
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,390
You must've told me.

652
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,387
I never told you about that, Carl.

653
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,327
Yeah, sure you did.
You just forgot.

654
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,868
With everything that's been going on,
it's natural.

655
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,900
You arranged this whole thing,
didn't you?

656
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,779
So what?

657
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,276
I want you to come with me.

658
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,145
The people in Chicago,
they want you to come.

659
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,187
It's a family firm, Lou.
They expect me to have a family.

660
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,096
Because I told them
I was getting married.

661
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,886
Boy, I'd sure hate to read my
performance review after that one.

662
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:22,690
"Ability to propose marriage,
zero out of a possible ten."

663
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,493
But I swear to you, Lou...

664
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,805
It's not about a job.

665
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,618
I love you.

666
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:54,086
I love you.
That's what this is about.

667
00:38:54,198 --> 00:39:01,627
And I want you to marry me,
because I love you.

668
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,083
Come on, Lou, say something.

669
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,453
I can't get this damn thing
off my finger.

670
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,572
Ummm...

671
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,802
You know, you can always
change your mind, Lou.

672
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,279
Keep your options open.

673
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,447
I'll keep that in mind.

674
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,058
[Phone rings]

675
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,667
Chicago.

676
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,705
Take the call, Carl.

677
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:49,408
Howdy, partner.

678
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,514
Yes, I'm still in Big Sky Country,

679
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,678
heading back to civilization
as we speak.

680
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,308
There he goes.

681
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,037
The Dude.

682
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,364
Well, look on the bright side, Lou.
He didn't overstay his welcome.

683
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:57,546
At least now everyone can stop
asking me how long he's staying.

684
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,876
No regrets, then?

685
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,546
Thought I saw Carl on the road
back there, heading out.

686
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,619
Yeah.

687
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,454
You know, I guess I feel kind of bad
about how things turned out.

688
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,926
Yeah. Me too.

689
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,419
Yeah, right.

690
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,268
Git along.

691
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:14,281
That's a nice job you did
with the icing, Lou.

692
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,623
It's my mom's recipe.
