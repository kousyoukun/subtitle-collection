00:00:05,627 --> 00:00:06,836
2 3 4
MAN: Two, three, four...

2
00:00:18,473 --> 00:00:21,100
你又来了
* Here you come again*

3
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:25,187
你说你是我的朋友
*And you say that you're my friend*

4
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:29,984
但我知道你的目的
But I know why you're here*

5
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:34,155
她想知道我的感受
火 She wants to know how I feel*

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,243
告诉她我很开心
Tell her that I am happy

7
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:43,998
告诉她我很欢愉
*Tell her that I am gay*

8
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:48,002
告诉她我心甘情愿
*Tell her Iwouldn't have it*

9
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:52,381
别无他想
*Any other way*

10
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:04,185
人们都在说
People have been talking*

11
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:10,191
不 这这这 这太蒂谬
Woman No tha tha that s just that s ridiculous.

12
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:13,444
我都说了 它又变成行星了
Woman 2: I'm telling you, it's a plainet again.

13
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:15,363
冥王星一直都是行星
Pluto was always a planet.

14
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:18,824
不 有段时间不是 现在又是了
No, it wasn t. Now it is again.

15
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,326
你这就好像是在跟我说
This is like when you tried to tell me

16
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:21,577
草莓是坚果一样
a strawberry is a nut.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,828
-草莓就是坚果 -不是的
Strawberry is a nut. - Irene: No.

18
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:25,331
种子长在外面的都是坚果
Anything with seeds on the outside is a nut?

19
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:27,041
-比如覆盆子-是坚果
A raspberry? - A nut.

20
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:30,503
我恨死你了
I hate your cunt heart.

21
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:34,674
-我的炸土豆丸子好了 -不错
My tots are done Oh, whoopie.

22
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:36,717
所以我们今晚看什么
So, what are we going to watch tonight?

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,220
你想继续看《亢奋》吗
You want to keep going with"Euphoria"?

24
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:42,515
那些觉得是自己发明了做爱的小鬼吗 不用了 谢谢
Kids who think they invented fucking? No, thank you.

25
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:45,309
靠 他妈的 弗莱彻家的把遥控器拿走了
Oh shit. Goddamn Fletchers have the remote.

26
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:47,895
喂 弗莱彻家的 我们要看《创智赢家》
Joyce: Hey, Fletchers. We're gonna watch "Shark Tank. "

27
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:50,856
少数服从多数
Majority rules the remote.

28
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:53,568
服从个屁
Majority rules my foot up your ass.

29
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,860
这什么垃圾节目
What is this garbage?

30
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:56,862
所以你看完了《奎恩茨福德郡谋杀案》
Joyce: So you finish"Quaintsfordshire Murders"

31
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:59,699
还想让我们看挪威的死人吗
and nowfyou want us to care about who dies in Norway?

32
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:02,660
-嘘 -凶手是金发那个
Fletchers: Shh! - Irene: The blonde did it.

33
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:04,579
死婊子们
Bitches.

34
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:11,544
艾琳 你的体征检测器充电了吗
Ooh, Irene, did you charge your heartcuff?

35
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:13,337
当然了 比利
I sure did, Billy.

36
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:17,550
很好笑 因为我这里看到
That's hilarious because, um, I'm showing:

37
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:20,469
艾琳 零格电 没有信号
Irene. Zero percent. No transmission.

38
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:22,763
你想监控我的一举一动
Oh, you want to track my every movement,

39
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:25,016
这样每次我去厕所
so you know every time I go to the bathroom

40
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,101
你都可以靠想象我
so you can jerk it to the knowledge

41
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:28,352
来打飞机
that I'm pooping.

42
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:29,478
这不是定位系统 艾琳
It's not a GPS, Irene,

43
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:30,730
它只是监控你的生命体征而已
all it does is track your vital signs.

44
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:33,107
我不会让你们像给狗装芯片一样监控我的
Not gonna chip me like some dog.

45
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,150
汪
Woof!

46
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,987
最后一次机会
Betty: Last chance.

47
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,740
最后一个动物园旅行的报名机会
Last chance to sign up for the zoo trip.

48
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:43,743
当然了 好极了
Oh, sure. Great.

49
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:46,245
但是等等
Oh, wait, though.

50
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:48,748
但我们赶得及回来换尿布
Will we get back in time to change our diapers

51
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,334
看天线宝宝吗
and to watch"Teletubbies"?

52
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,878
我们不是小婴儿 贝蒂
We're not fuckin' toddlers, Betty.

53
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,588
早见过鸸鹋了
We've seen emus before.

54
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:56,923
如果你们不能
Betty: If you can't make an effort

55
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:59,342
更加积极参与社区活动
to be a more positive community presence,

56
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:01,719
我可能得向管理部门
I may have to report

57
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:04,722
举报你们的非法药物种植了
your illegal drug plants to the administration.

58
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:05,932
不不不
No, no, no, no.

59
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:08,684
-不不不 -我们那是救命药
No, no, no. Our life- saving medicine.

60
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:10,519
我知道你没得青光眼
I know you don't have glaucoma.

61
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:12,438
而且我很讨厌
And I, and I hate this

62
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:14,440
你们玩的这诡异的中国游戏
witchy Chinese game you're playing.

63
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:15,650
这都什么 咒符吗
What are these, runes?

64
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:16,776
没错 贝蒂
That's right, Betty.

65
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:20,446
我们是喜欢药物的撒旦崇拜者
We're Satanists who love drugs.

66
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,826
她真是烦死人了
What a fucking cop.

67
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:30,540
好了
Alright now.

68
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:32,458
我们把你安排在了三楼
So we have you on our third floor.

69
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,627
那里是医疗区
That's our medical care unit.

70
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,463
我可以带你转转我们这里
I can give you a full tour of the facilities.

71
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:39,966
然后帮你戴上体征检测器
: And get you set up on our heartcuff system.

72
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:42,677
但我先送你上去安顿好吧
But I'll let you get settled in first.

73
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:59,193
你和我想的一样吗
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

74
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,158
我们得把那狗娘养的杀了
We have to kill that motherfucker.

75
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:09,829
倾倒
*Comin'down*

76
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:13,332
倾倒
*Comin'down*

77
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:16,752
倾倒
Comin' down*

78
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,631
我为之倾倒
*Yes, I'm comin'down*

79
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:22,174
满意了吗
We happy?

80
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:24,218
倾倒 倾倒 倾倒
*Imcomin'down, down, down, down, down*

*I'mcomin'down, down, down, down, dowq*

82
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,305
心脏病发
*Comin'down with a heartache*

83
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:34,729
我没病 却体温火热
*I ain't sick but I got a fever*

84
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:39,066
血压升高
Blood pressure's runnin'high*

85
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:42,528
脉搏异常 夜不能寐
*Pulse ain't right, I can't sleep at night*

86
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:45,197
这就是原囚
And here's the reason why*

87
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:48,284
小心点 恩哈特
Watch out, Earnhardt.

88
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:49,368
这可不是碰碰车
This ain't bumper cars.

89
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:52,121
真的很抱歉 等一下 艾琳
I am so sorry. Wait a minute, Irene.

90
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:54,248
可能我只是走太快了
I guess I was just going a little bit too fastl

91
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,499
-你没事吧 -没事
You alright? - Yeah.

92
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,710
你可真是神级赛车手 
Mario Andretti over here.

93
00:04:57,753 --> 00:05:00,171
医生无法确诊
*A doctor can't diagnose*

94
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:03,132
因为当心碎的时候
Cause when a heart starts to fall apart

95
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:06,427
听诊器是听不出来的
* You can't hear through the stethoscope*

96
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:10,306
我这是怎么了我说这很简单
* What's wrong with me? I said it's a simple fact*

97
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:13,517
我觉得你不会回来了
*I don't believe you're ever comin'back*

98
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,102
我为之倾倒
*I'mcomin'down, down*

99
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:16,979
我为之倾倒

倾倒
大 Down, down, down*

104
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:28,157
乔伊斯 你能推我去厕所吗
Joyce, can you wheel me over to the shitter?

105
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:31,786
-你又要上厕所吗 -噫
You have to go again? Woman: Ugh.

106
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:24,547
动作快点
Hurry it up in there.

107
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,756
车到了
The bus is here.

108
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,967
动物又不会跑
The animals aren't going anywhere.

109
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,303
我们不能错过猩猩表演啊
We can't miss the orangutan show.

110
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:31,429
她可厉害了
She's very impressive.

111
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:34,265
贝蒂 魔术贴你都觉得厉害
Betty, you think Velcro is impressive.

112
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:47,922
我真的很高兴
I'm so glad

113
00:07:48,757 --> 00:07:50,424

已经11点10分了 车要走了
It's 11: 10. The bus is going to leave.

115
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:22,665
我得上厕所 她到底在干什么
I got to piss. What the hell is she doing in there?

116
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,792
我也不知道怎么说
I don't know what to tell you people.

117
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:25,960
她腹泻
She has diarrhea.

118
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:27,837
到此为止 我受够了
That's it. I've had it.

119
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,838
车已经好了
Woman: The bus is ready.

120
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,548

123
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:38,598

124
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,349
-让让 -终于好了
Excuse me. Finally!

125
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:01,746
有什么入不了的
Big deal:

126
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:02,997
各位注意
Man: Attention.

127
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,957

离手
And clear.

145
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:25,037
天 是谁啊
Oh dear, who is that?

146
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,039
新来的 312的 本
Uh, new guy from 312, Ben.

147
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:28,583
心脏病发
Heart attack.

148
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:14,587
是否存在完美谋杀呢
Narrator Does the perfect murder exist?

149
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,131
这就得问问猫头鹰了
This, I have asked the owls.

150
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:25,890
嘘
Fletchers: Shh!

151
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:28,893
-能之后再吸吗 -抱歉
Hey, do you mind? Sorry.

152
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:31,896
你不用管弗莱彻家的
Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry about the Fletchers.

153
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:34,273
弗莱彻家的是吧 谢了
Oh, the Fletchers. Thanks.

154
00:11:34,316 --> 00:11:35,983
我得说 感觉他们挺硬核的
I got to say, they seem very hard- core.

155
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:37,026
哪里人啊 荷兰人吗
What are they, Dutch?

156
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:38,819
没有 他们只是喜欢看谋杀
No, just into murder,

157
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:40,655
很没礼貌
very rude.

158
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:42,990
我呢 我绝对不会跟一位女士说
Now, me, I would never tell a lady

159
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,992
不要吸
when to stop sucking.

160
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:51,249
搞什么 老兄
What the fuck, dude?

161
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,542
皮特
Betty: Pete,

162
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:54,460
别烦新来的小姑娘了来
stop pestering the new girl, come on.

163
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:57,463
别忘了要报名下周的动物园之旅
And don't forget to sign up for the zoo trip next week.

164
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:00,883
他好变态
That is a very pervy guy.

165
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:03,052
-他就是变态皮特 -怪不得
It's Pervy Pete. Explains it.

166
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:04,971
远离他和他的朋友
Betty: Steer clear of his entire gang,

167
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:07,223
农原体卡尔和淋病格雷格
Chlamydia Cal and Gonorrhea Greg.

168
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,391
都是变态
They're creeps.

169
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,892
至少人如其名 是吧
Well, at least truth in advertising, huh?

170
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:12,395
其实我觉得有衣原体的是格雷格
Actually, I think it's Greg that has Chlamydia.

171
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:16,440
就是冰岛和格陵兰岛那样反过来是吧
Aha. So, kind of an Iceland- Greenland scenario

172
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:19,193
这里的所有人所有事我都知道
I know everything about everyone who lives here.

173
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:21,612
跟紧我就好 我是贝蒂
Just stick with me. I'm Betty

174
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,531
希望不是肉毒杆菌贝蒂
Hopefully not Botulism Betty.

175
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:27,493
大部分人都意识不到
Betty: Most people don't realize all the things

176
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:28,703
压力锅多有用
you can do with an Instapot.

177
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:31,455
芝士蛋糕 丹佛鸡蛋卷
Cheesecake. Denver omelet.

178
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:34,625
我之前用了22分钟就做出了红葡萄酒洋葱烧牛肉
I once made a beef bourguignon in 22 minutes.

179
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:39,714
女士们 能不能
Ladies, would you please turn

180
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:41,841
把收音机音量关轻一点
your ghetto blaster down?

181
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,472
小心那两个
Watch out for these two.

182
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:50,474
她们是重刑犯
They're felons.

183
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:52,810
一还嗑药 一懂了
And junkies. - Right.

184
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:55,646
这儿可真是罪恶的巢穴
Ah. Real den of iniquity, this place.

185
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:58,024
不管你干什么记住
Whatever you do, stay away

186
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,817
远离乔伊斯和艾琳
from Joyce and Irene.

187
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,491
我不想知道
Charlie: Idon't want to know.

188
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:09,160
我真的不想
I really don t.

189
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:10,745
好糟糕哦
Ah! Irene: That was awful.

190
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:12,163
你们把我彻底打败了
You guys are trouncing me,

191
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:13,915
你们俩也太凶猛了
cause you are a pair of shuffle sharks.

192
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:17,084
你姿势不对 太紧张了
Your form is off. You're too tense

193
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:18,211
你得放松一点什么没有啊 我多放松啊
You need to loosen up. - What? No. I'm loose.

194
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:21,005
我整个人就是放松的 我不放松吗
That's my whole thing. Am I not loose?

195
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:23,549
你该试试愤怒治疗 那是什么
You should try rage therapy What's that?

196
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:33,100
感觉好爽
That shit feels good.

197
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:34,894
来 深呼吸
Hey, you, come on. Reach deep.

198
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:36,771
要从下体开始发力
It starts in the labia.

199
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:39,232
你知道吧
Mm- mm. You know.

200
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,108
我觉得
I think

201
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:43,110
我还是算了
that I'm fine with bottling

202
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:45,446
你们肯定不想看到我释放的
I- - you don't want to see me unbottled

203
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:48,699
你们接受不了我的释放
You can't, you can't handle the unbottled.

204
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:50,743
就是这玩意儿
Well, the thing that got us

205
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,286
让我们熬过了在贝德福德希尔斯的时候
through our stint at Bedford Hills.

206
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:53,704
是啊
Joyce: Yeah.

207
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:56,749
我靠 你们是真蹲过大牢啊
Crazy. You kids were really inside, huh? Upstate.

208
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,001
我们是政治犯
Joyce: We were political prisoners.

209
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,419
不开玩笑啊
Wow, no shit.

210
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:01,963
绝对不开玩笑
No shit whatsoever.

211
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:03,798
你们怎么惹上这种事儿的
Charlie: How'd you get into that?

212
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,343
我当时在读人学 时局动荡
I was in college. It was a turbulent time.

213
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:10,221
毕竟是60年代 你听见没
Oh yeah. I mean, the'60s. - Did you hear that?

214
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:11,889
那是70年代 小婊子 哦对
The 70s, bitch. - Charlie: Oh, right.

215
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:13,683
我市来还想说是90年代
You know, I was going to say the 90s

216
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:14,850
囚为你穿的这么多法兰绒
because of all the flannel

217
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:16,477
你最好是真的这么想
You'd have been better off going there.

218
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,687
真是抱歉
I'm so sorry,

219
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:19,564
只是两个吞世代和沙壶球游戏罢了
just a pair of tweens and a shuffleboard.

220
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:23,192
哇哦
Charlie: Whoa- whoa!

221
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:25,194
－艾琳 没错
- Irene! - Irene: Yeah, that's right

222
00:14:26,905 --> 00:14:28,906
很正经啊
Very straight edge.

223
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:30,908
和我想的完全不一样
I mean, not at all what I was expecting.

224
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,660
在碰到我的守护恶魔之前
Yeah, I was on the straight and narrow

225
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,745
我可正派了
before I met my guardian devil.

226
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:35,746
一 什么 一是啊
What? - Yeah.

227
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:36,747
她当时在大路上
She was shouting down

228
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,207
大喊大叫地宣讲
some coeds on the quad,

229
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,917
我听到了她说的话
and I. heard what she was saying

230
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,377
给我打开了全新世界的大门
and my brain opened up.

231
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,504
在那之前世界显得那么不合理
World didn't make sense before that...

232
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:45,548
然后突然就合理了
and then it did.

233
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:46,799
这故事真是太可爱了
It's adorable.

234
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:48,467
她带我加入了组织
Irene: She brought me into the group.

235
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,971
改变了我的人生
Changed my life.

236
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,600
把我介绍给加布里尔
Introduced me to Gabriel.

237
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:58,436
哎哟喂
Ooh- la- la.

238
00:14:58,478 --> 00:15:01,063
这个加布里尔又是谁 是谁
Who's this Gabriel? What, who's Gabriel?

239
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:02,940
这个组织就是加布里尔成立的
Gabriel started the group.

240
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:04,942
他招募了我
He recruited me and.

241
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:08,279
一训练我们 -启迪我们 -训练我们
...he trained us, inspired us. - Trained us.

242
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:11,532
他是我们的 指路明灯
He was our...he was our guiding light.

243
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:12,783
原来如此啊
I see what's happening here.

244
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:13,993
我猜他应该很有魅力
I'm getting a real magnetic vibe.

245
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:15,453
就像那种眼神迷死人的邪教领袖
Like a cult leader with pretty eyes.

246
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:17,121
他长得像塔吉特百货卖的那种
Ehh, he looked like one of those white guys

247
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:19,332
相框里的白人
you see in the picture frames that you buy from Target.

248
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:20,583
你说什么
Excuse me.

249
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:21,876
怎么了艾琳 派胡言 才不是
No excuse you. - Irene, you're nuts. Uh- uh.

250
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,296
拜托 加布里尔很性感
Excuse me. Gabriel was hot.

251
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:26,672
好吧 我中和一下你们的争议
Okay, I'm gonna split the diff.

252
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:30,134
这人应该像那种高中法语老师
I'm gonna picture my high school French teacher.

253
00:15:30,177 --> 00:15:32,887
但有一件事我俩看法相同
One thing's for sure though...

254
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,640
他有个消防栓一样的大席
Both: Dick like a fire hydrant!

255
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:38,559
加布里尔真行啊 谁不喜欢这样的
Oh, good for Gabriel. Everyone enjoys it.

256
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:40,728
对长得好 加布里尔
Yes. Well done, Gabriel.

257
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:42,480
加布里尔不仅器大
Gabriel was more than that.

258
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:44,649
心地还好 他知道我们可以
You know, he, he knew that we could make

259
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:45,983
通过追究恶人
the world a better place

260
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:49,403
把世界变得更美好
if we hold the assholes to account.

261
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:50,988
你懂我意思吗
You feel me?

262
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:52,823
我懂 这就是加布里尔
- I feel you. That was Gabriel.

263
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,033
我懂你
I feel you, I'm- -

264
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:56,118
我完完全全理解你们在说什么
I am picking up what you're putting down.

265
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:59,163
我得承认好久没见过像你俩这么酷的
And I gotta say, you two are the coolest motherfuckers

266
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,249
牛逼姐妹儿了
I have met in a very long time.

267
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,418
真的抱歉爆粗了不然表达不出来
Seriously. I mean, sorry to curse, but necessary.

268
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:06,629
一没事 一之后发生了什么
what happened afterthat

269
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:08,548
他招募了你俩后 发生了什么
What happened after he recruited you?

270
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,218
我们就开始干大事了
We went to work.

271
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:13,636


272
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,104
稍等
*Hold on*

273
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:26,399
天 这么一听
Charlie: I got to say, it sounds like

274
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:28,359
我都觉得自己生不逢时了
I was born in the wrong time.

275
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:30,236
我们开始有了点名气
We were starting to get a reputation.

276
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,029
一个乐队还在他们的专辑封面上
A band even put our picture

277
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:33,531
使用了我们的照片
on the cover of their album,

278
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:34,615
色调消沉乐队
The Droopy Hues.

279
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:36,867
色调消沉乐队
Charlie: The Droopy Hues.

280
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,370
天 这名字真烂
Gosh, what an awful name for a band.

281
00:16:39,454 --> 00:16:41,747
-他们的歌怎么样 -烂透了
Were they any good? - Awful.

282
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:10,234
你是说 那种吗
You mean like

283
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:13,070
查莉 没错
Joyce: Uh, Charlie. Yes.

284
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:15,156
但 一起上吗
But...together.

285
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,284
哎唷 你们看《亢奋》长大的一代
Okay. The Euphorica generation

286
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:20,244
连这个都接受不了
can't handle the heat?

287
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,663
《亢奋》你们以为我多大
Euphoria? How old do you think I am?

288
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:24,373
别忘了给你的手环充电 艾琳
Don't forget to charge your heartcuff, Irene.

289
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,917
能不能别这么絮叨
And don't forget to take your head

290
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,710
气氛杀手 比利
out of the man's ass, Billy.

291
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,340
你知道你不住在这里吧
You know you don't live here, right?

292
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:33,758
那是伊莲的开衫吗
Is that Elaine's cardigan?

293
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,926
我是在失物招领处
You know what, I found it

294
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:36,427
找到的
in the, uh, the lost and found,

295
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,970
我得承认 那里真是个好地方
which I got to say is stellar.

296
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:39,096
有好多好东西
So much stuff in there.

297
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:40,598
嗯 那不是遗失物品
No, it's, uh, it's actually not lost.

298
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:43,601
她得了动脉瘤 是穿着那件衣服
Um, she had an aneurysm and died.

299
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:44,518
去世的
in that sweater.

300
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:45,895
是啊 一股红花油味
Yeah, it smells like Icy Hot

301
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:48,231
能闻出来她度过了美好的一生
and a life well lived.

302
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:50,441
她真是难以理喻
She's gone full Cocoon.

303
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:52,109
比利 你愿意娶给我吗
Irene: Billy, will you marry me?

304
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:54,570
嘿 比利 比利
Hey, Billy, Billy.

305
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:58,824
所以 你们一起生活 一起恋爱
So, you're living, you're loving,

306
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,368
一起改变世界
you're changing the world.

307
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:02,620
后来出了什么问题
What went wrong?

308
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:07,250
我们在计划一次最为直接的行动
Oh, we were planning our most direct action.

309
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:10,670
一场真正的革命
It was the real revolution.

310
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:12,797
我们要点燃整个世界
Joyce: We were gonna set the world on fire.

311
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,051
我们站在了风口浪尖
Irene: We were on the cusp.

312
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:18,678
走到那一步总是会这样对吧
That's when it always happens, right?

313
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:34,235
我们遭到了突袭
It was a raid.

314
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:40,575
你们就是
So that's how...

315
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:43,869
这样被捕的
that's how you got arrested?

316
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:46,998
他们的计划不是逮捕我们
Their plan wasn't to arrest us.

317
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,294
他们荷枪实弹就闯进来了
They came in there with guns blazing.

318
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:54,881
我们都想逃跑 但
We all tried to run, but...

319
00:18:58,218 --> 00:18:59,468
艾琳
Irene.

320
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:06,100
艾琳太勇敢
Irene was brave.

321
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:09,186
她不想丢下加布里尔
She couldn't leave Gabriel behind.

322
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:11,105
你 趴地上 趴下
Officer: You, on the ground, on the ground!

323
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,443
嘿 看着我 有我在
Joyce: Hey, look at me, I got you.

324
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:16,694
我来帮你啦
Hey, I got you, okay.

325
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:18,529
－我的腿没知觉了 －有我在
Irene: I can't feel my legs. I got you.

326
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:20,281
我的腿没知觉了
Irene: I can't feel my legs.

327
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:21,866
我感觉不到我的腿
I can't feel my legs.

328
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:23,284
我感觉不到我的腿了
I can't feel my legs.

329
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:35,004
他们带走了一切 一切
They took, took everything.

330
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:38,591
我的腿
My legs...

331
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:42,929
我们的自由
our freedom.

332
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:45,306
和加布里尔
And Gabriel.

333
00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:51,270
只希望他走得不痛苦
Just hope he didn't suffer.

334
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:55,942
但永远无人得知了
But we'll never know.

335
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:03,324
真是的 天啊 你们两个
Fucking Christ, man. You two.

336
00:20:03,325 --> 00:20:06,285
失去了那么多 却仍选择勇往直前
AlI that loss and you keep moving forward,

337
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:08,329
继续自己的生活
living your lives.

338
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:11,249
看来还是要原谅和忘记 对吧
Forgive and forget, right?

339
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,917
哦 亲爱的
Irene: Oh, sweetie.

340
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,918
不
No.

341
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:18,631
我们从不原谅
We never forgive.

342
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,184
我们这有瑜伽 游泳
Billy: We have yoga, swimming,

343
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:31,978
普拉提 感兴趣都可以参与
Pilates, if that interests you.

344
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:35,398
好了 请您在这儿
Alright, if I can get your signature

345
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
签个名

346
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:39,610
最下面
Sign on the bottom.

347
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,737
我们在三楼为您安排予
Alright. We have you in a suite

348
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,824
一间套房 就在我们的医护区
on our third floor, our medical care unit

349
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:46,867

I can give you a full tour of the facilities

350
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,953
为您佩戴健康手环系统
and get you set up with our heartcuff system.

351
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:51,581
不过 我先让你们安顿一下
But, uh, I'll let y'all get settled in first.

352
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:53,624

354
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:57,837
咱们走吧 这样吧
Let's go! Actually

355
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,714
我让人帮您把行李送上去
I have someone to carry those bags for you.

356
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:01,090
查莉

357
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:10,766

Alright, Uncle Ben,

358
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:13,227

I've got to hit the road.

359
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:15,187
我 诶
I, uh...

360
00:21:16,815 --> 00:21:18,024
爱你
love you.

361
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:29,869

I'm his nephew.

362
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:31,495
当然
Sure.

363
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,126
要我把窗户关上吗
Want me to, uh, close that window?

364
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,295
不 我喜欢冷一点
No, I like the cold

365
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:44,884
所以 你是哪里人昵
So, where are you from?

366
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:47,178
哪里也不是
Nowhere.

367
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:49,055
会有人来看望你吗
You got any visitors?

368
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:50,848
我可以跟前台说一下
Uh, cause I can let the front know,

369
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:52,600
这里很大 不好找
this place can be a real maze.

370
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:53,851
没有访客
I got no one.

371
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:02,652
好吧
Alright.

372
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:03,861
我把门带上
I'll get this.

373
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:06,864
欢迎您的入住
Welcome.

374
00:22:08,825 --> 00:22:11,744
搭船去英国吧 宝贝
*Catch a boat to England, baby*

375
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:14,830
或许去西班牙
*Maybe to Spain*

376
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:17,625
无论我走到哪
*Wherever I have gone*

377
00:22:18,794 --> 00:22:20,670
无论我走到哪里 去过哪里
*Wherever I've been and gone*

378
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:24,131
无论我走到哪里 忧郁
*Wherever I have gone, the blues*

379
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,178
与我常伴
*Are all the same*

380
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:33,349
加布里尔
Gabriel.

381
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:36,519
让人去买威士忌宝贝
*Send out for whisky, baby*

382
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:38,354
派人去买金洒
*Send out for gin*

383
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:42,191
我和客房服务 亲爱的
*Me and room service, honey*

384
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:44,860
我和客房服务宝贝
*Me and room service, babe*

385
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:46,988
哪怕亲眼看着你
Joyce: Even when I saw you,

386
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:49,907
我都不敢相信
I couldn't believe it.

387
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,243
我们俩都不相信
We both couldn't.

388
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:56,163
但我认得你的眼睛
But I knew your eyes.

389
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:02,837
这一刻我在脑子里想了好几年
I've thought about this moment for years,

390
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,966
想象着如果再见到你们
imagining what I'd do and what I'd say

391
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:10,428
我会做什么 说什么
if I ever saw you again.

392
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,265
现在终于找到了你们
And now that I finally found you

393
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:19,061
我无语凝噎了
I don't know.

394
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:20,730
早知道你活着 我们肯定会找你的
Joyce: We would have looked for you.

395
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:23,733
我们会找你一辈子
We never would have stopped looking.

396
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:25,443
我们以为你死了
We thought you were dead.

397
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:31,115
但你逃出来了
But you got away.

398
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:34,243
谢天谢地 你逃出来了
Thank God you got away.

399
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:37,455
无论我在哪里游戏
*Wherever I have played*

400
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:40,374
不管我何时掷出骰子
*Whenever I've throwed them dice*

401
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:42,585
无论我在哪里游戏
*Wherever I have played

402
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:44,629
忧郁
* The blues*

403
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:47,340
支配着整场游戏
*Have run the game*

404
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:55,389
也许明天吧 亲爱的
*Maybe tomorrow, honey*

405
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:57,808
也许路上的某一处
Someplace down the line*

406
00:23:58,977 --> 00:24:01,145
一觉醒来 我会变老
*I'||I wake up older*

407
00:24:02,022 --> 00:24:04,774
变得很 老妈妈
*So much older, mama*

408
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:06,525
一觉醒来 我会变老
*I'|l wake up older*

409
00:24:06,568 --> 00:24:11,489
直到那一刻 我才会停止尝试
*And I'lI just stop all my tryin'*

410
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:17,828
我当时别无选择
Gabriel: I didn't have a choice.

411
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:19,247
事态已经失控了
Things had gotten out of hand,

412
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:20,998
而我阻止不了他们
and I, I couldn't stop them.

413
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,291
凭我一人之力不行
Not on my own.

414
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:28,297
我知道这是正确的抉择
I know I did the right thing.

415
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,133
但逼不得已 伤害我的爱人
But it kills me that I had to hurt

416
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:32,510
让我心如刀割
the ones I loved.

417
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:35,596
心如刀割
It kills you?

418
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:39,934
天 我们损失了
Man, we lost.

419
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:42,687
几十年的光阴
decades of our lives.

420
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:48,734
我失去了双腿
I lost my goddamn legs.

421
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:50,987
我知道
I know.

422
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:52,280
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

423
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,240
这就是我来这里的原因
That's why I'm here.

424
00:24:57,035 --> 00:24:58,744
我一直会做一个梦
I have this dream

425
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:01,664
我看到
where I see.

426
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:05,167
你们俩在人群中我跟着你们
the two of you in a crowd, and I follow you.

427
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,714
走了好远好远 走到脚都流血了
For miles. For miles and miles until my feet bleed.

428
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:11,591
我努力解释
I try to explain myself.

429
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:13,801
但你们就是不回头
But you never turn around.

430
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:16,554
50年来
In 50 years

431
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:19,307
你俩从没回过头
you never turn around.

432
00:25:19,975 --> 00:25:22,226
我意识到
And I realized that

433
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:23,769
如果不告诉你们真相
the dream would never change

434
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:25,730
这个梦我会一直做下去
until I told you the truth.

435
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,234
你们能原谅我吗
Can you please forgive me?

436
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:44,165
当然 加布里尔
Sure, Gabriel.

437
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:49,086
我们原谅你
We forgive you.

438
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:07,897
你和我想的一样吗
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

439
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,691
我们得杀了那个混蛋
We have to kill that motherfucker.

440
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:14,528
都11点10分了 车都要开了
It's 11: 10. The bus is going to leave.

441
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:17,573
我要尿尿 她在里面到底在干吗
I got to piss. What the hell is she doing in there?

442
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:19,784
我也不知道该跟你们怎么说
Look, I don't know what to tell you people.

443
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,869
她拉肚子了
She has diarrhea.

444
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:24,997
拉屎的事也能扯这么久 嗨起来了 女士们

452
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,179
色调消沉
Droopy Hues

453
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:43,307

Okay, let's settle this Which one is our friend Gabriel?

454
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:49,355
人跟我想的不一样
Not what I was expecting.

455
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:52,316
但席的规格你们是一点没夸张
But you did not over hype the D- train.

456

00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:37,028
天啊

474
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,363
乔伊斯和艾琳错过了一场好戏
Joyce and Irene are really missing out.

475
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:43,826
变态女同
Deviants.

476
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,914
假正经
Very uptight.

477
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,336
我们走了还不到半天
We weren't even gone half a day.

478
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,629
这次是什么人
What was it this time?

479
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:56,589

482
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
本是谁 
Who was Ben?

483
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:07,016
这个问题
That's a,

484
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:08,476
我们每个人都
that's a question for each of us

485
00:28:08,518 --> 00:28:09,894
有自己的答案
to answer for ourselves.

486
00:28:12,814 --> 00:28:13,731
所以
And so,

487
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:15,775
让我们默哀片刻
let us take a moment of silence

488
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:17,944
来回顾市的一生
to reflect on Ben's life

489
00:28:19,071 --> 00:28:21,530
以及他对我们每个人的意义
and what he meant to each of us.

490
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:24,533
嘿 假侄子
Psst. Hey, fake nephew.

491
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:26,869
节哀顺变 往旁边坐坐
Sorry for your loss, man. Scoot over.

492
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:28,454
你为什么
Why are you.

493
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:30,414
我是他的亲侄子
I'm a real nephew.

494
00:28:30,457 --> 00:28:33,251
听着 我才不在乎你为什么要撒谎
Oh. Listen, I don't care why you're lying.

495
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:34,669
如果他是你的
You know, if it was

496
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:36,379
甜心老爹之类的
a sugar daddy situation or whatever,

497
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:38,005
-不是 -哦
It wasn't Oh.

498
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,050
他就是我叔
He was my uncle.

499
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:42,260
噢 甜心怪蜀黍
Oh, sugar uncle?

500
00:28:42,302 --> 00:28:44,178
正常叔叔 啥甜不甜的
Regular uncle. No sugar.

501
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,389
你不是那个护工吗
Aren't you, like, the bellhop?

502
00:28:46,431 --> 00:28:50,101
你又不认识他 你来干嘛
You didn't know him. Why are you here?

503
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:52,144
他就是 看起来挺伤心的
Well, he just, he seemed sad.

504
00:28:52,145 --> 00:28:55,481
一个亲人都没有
Like, he didn't have anyone, you know.

505
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:58,818
我想至少我可以来送他一程
I figured I could show up here at least,

506
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,986
你知道的
you know.

507
00:29:02,864 --> 00:29:05,866
其实呢 我市不该告诉你
The truth is, oh, I mean, I shouldn't tell you this,

508
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:08,286
但反正他已经死了 所以可能
but he's dead now, so it's probably

509
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:14,458
市参加了证人保护计划 我是负责他的特工
Ben was in witness protection. I was his case agent.

510
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:21,841
-哇 真的吗 -是啊
Wow. No shit. - Hmm.

511
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:24,343
所以你是联调局的了
So you're, like, FBI?

512
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:26,804
严格说来是的
Technically. I mean, yes, I am.

513
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:28,514
只不过
It's just

514
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:31,601
我以为自己会去打击恐怖分子
I thought I'd be, you know, fighting the war on terror.

515
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,394
结果现在帮一个老男人买杂货
Instead, I'm getting groceries for guys

516
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:35,730
他证词的年龄都比我大
whose testimony was relevant before I was born.

517
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,358
白瞎了我流利的乌尔都语
Never mind that Im fluent in fucking Urdu.

518
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:41,319
-厉害 -是啊
Oh wow. Yeah.

519
00:29:41,361 --> 00:29:42,528
谢谢你们
Thank you.

520
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:48,534
所以 他是黑手党吗
So was he, like, Mafia?

521
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:50,119
他于了杀人越货的事
Did he do wet work?

522
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:51,746
我不能透露更多了
I've said too much already.

523
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:57,251
咦这人怎么看起来这么面熟
Gosh, where do I know this guy from?

524
00:29:57,336 --> 00:29:58,794
他上过电视吗
Was he on TV or something?

525
00:29:58,795 --> 00:29:59,879
应该没有吧
I don't think so.

526
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,010
消防栓
Fire hydrant.

527
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:07,970
知道了 知道了
Uh- oh. Uh- oh.

528
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:10,181
-色调下沉 -啥下沉
Droopy Hues. - Droop- What?

529
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:12,725
这是加布里尔 有屌为证
Yeah, that's Gabriel. Look at his dick.

530
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:15,394
是啊 什么 你怎么知道的
Y- yes. What? How do you know that?

531
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:17,521
不是瞎吹哈 我跟两个酷老姐们儿
Well, not to brag, but I'm friends

532
00:30:17,564 --> 00:30:19,106
乔伊斯和艾琳是好朋友
with these pretty super cool chicks,

533
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:20,399
她们就住在这里
Joyce and Irene, who live here,

534
00:30:20,442 --> 00:30:22,526
还跟我讲过她们的浪漫史呢
and they were telling me about their old flame.

535
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:25,196
-天啊乔伊斯·卡特和艾琳·斯莫斯
Ow, dude. - Joyce Carter and Irene Smothers.

536
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:26,489
对 乔伊斯和艾琳
Yes, Joyce and Irene.

537
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:28,574
乔伊斯·卡特和艾琳·斯莫斯也在这
Joyce Carter and Irene Smothers are here?

538
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:30,993
我们关系很好 一起搓麻 为什么
Yeah, they're my buds. We Mahjong. Why?

539
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:44,507
倾倒
*Comin'down*

540
00:30:46,218 --> 00:30:47,635
乔伊斯 艾琳
Joyce, Irene.

541
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:50,179
我是联邦调查局的卢卡·克拉克探员
Special Agent Luca Clark, FBI.

542
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,847
跟我走一趟吧
Come with me, please.

543
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,684
我要倒下 倒下 倒下了
*I'mcoming down, down, down, down, down*

544
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:57,019
心痛欲绝地倒下了
*Coming down with a heartache*

545
00:30:57,896 --> 00:30:59,146
查莉
Luca: Charlie.

546
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,315
她们使用非法药物
Betty: They use illegal drugs.

547
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:04,068
在安静时间大声喧哗
They have zero respect for quiet time.

548
00:31:04,111 --> 00:31:05,778
在动物园时
And at the zoo,

549
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:09,115
她俩在玩什么性爱电击
they were doing some kind of sexual zapping.

550
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:11,200
彼得生日派对时
And at Peters birthday party,

551
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:13,244
她俩都吃了两块蛋糕
they both had two pieces of cake.

552
00:31:13,245 --> 00:31:14,704
我一块都没吃到
And I, I didn't get any.

553
00:31:14,746 --> 00:31:16,706
女士 谢谢您分享这么多
Yes, ma'am. Thank you for sharing

554
00:31:16,748 --> 00:31:19,166
有用信息给我们
all of this very helpful information.

555
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:21,544
她俩绝不是好人
Those two are no good.

556
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:27,633
搁这当道德警察呢
What a fucking cop.

557
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:30,219
所以通过健康手环确定 本去世时
Okay, so the heartcuff data pins the time of death

558
00:31:30,262 --> 00:31:32,054
乔伊斯和艾琳都在动物园
when Joyce and Irene were at the zoo,

559
00:31:32,097 --> 00:31:33,556
所以加布里尔不是他们杀的
so they didn't kill Gabriel.

560
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,850
你直接来问我不就完了
Well, I could have told you that.

561
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,727
一般来讲 一位被保护证人见到
Well, normally, if someone in witness protection meets

562
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:41,564
指认的对象后
the people he, you know, witnessed

563
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,065
又离奇死亡
and then suddenly drops dead

564
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:45,735
你是说本或者加布里尔
Wait, are you saying that Ben or Gabriel or whatever,

565
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:47,904
就是当年出卖她们的人
he's the guy that ratted them out.

566
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,488
天 我真蠢
Oh God. I'm just so, so dumb.

567
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:51,407
他说想要转来这里
He said he wanted to transfer here,

568
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,409
我一点功课都没做说 就说
and I said, "Mossy Oaks. Sounds nice. "

569
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:55,036
“苔藓橡树”听起来不错
O I did zero research whatsoever.

570
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:57,705
是啊 是不够细心
Oh, yes. No, that is not very thorough.

571
00:31:57,748 --> 00:31:59,790
但你也不用太自责
But, uh, don't beat yourself up

572
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,709
毕竟 人不是她们杀的
Cause guess what, they didn't kill him.

573
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:03,920
时间地点都对不上
I mean, with the zoo and the time

574
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:05,254
我认识她们
and I know them,

575
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:06,964
两人都是酷大姐
these guys are cool as shit.

576
00:32:06,965 --> 00:32:08,966
不会做出那种事儿
Okay? They are not murderers.

577
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:12,428
查莉 乔伊斯和艾琳才不是酷大姐
Charlie, Joyce and Irene are not cool as shit.

578
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:13,971
她们是国内恐怖分子
They're domestic terrorists.

579
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:15,056
得了吧 这位先生
Alright, Mr. Man.

580
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:16,766
知道他们被抓时
Do you know what they were planning

581
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:18,517
-在做什么吗 -知道
when they were arrested? Yeah, I do.

582
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,229
她们在策划一场人游行之类的
They were doing some kind of a big march or something. So that's, uh...

583
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:22,480
他们打算用炸弹
There were going to blow up a meeting

584
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:24,065
搞砸一场
of the Model United Nations

585
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:26,108
模拟联合国会议
with bombs they made out of

586
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:27,401
用高压锅炸弹
: pressure cookers.

587
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:29,654
等等 你是说她们想
Huh. Wait, I'm sorry, they were going

588
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,614
炸掉联合国
to blow up the UN?

589
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:33,449
模拟联合国
The Model UN.

590
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:35,785
是高中生为了赚学分
As in high schoolers pretending

591
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:38,120
搞的一种模拟会
to be the UN for extra credit.

592
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:41,624
这性质就没那么恶劣吧
Okay. Is that better or worse?

593
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,751
毕竟不是真的联合国 对吧
Because, I mean, that's not the real UN, right?

594
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:45,586
性质更恶劣了
It's so much worse. They...

595
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:48,548
她们想用炸弹
They were going to kill children

596
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:50,550
炸死孩子
with explosives.

597
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,057
-惨绝人寰 -是啊
Yikes. Yeah.

598
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,601
-要是你遇到危险 -是啊
Anything comes up. - Yeah...

599
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:02,853
-你还是留着吧 -我不需要
You should keep that. I don't need that.

600
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:04,146
也许她们没杀加布里尔
Maybe they didn't kill Gabriel,

601
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:06,649
但你自己要小心 查莉
but watch your back Charlie.

602
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:08,025
这两个女人极其危险
Those two women are extremely dangerous.

603
00:33:08,026 --> 00:33:09,110
这两个女人极其危险
Those two women are extremely dangerous.

604
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:29,046
掀翻三观了
- That was intense.

605
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:30,464
我以为自己在演《华尔街之狼》
I felt like I was in"Wolf of Wall Street"

606
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:32,466
还不是搞笑的那部分
all of a sudden and not the fun parts.

607
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,177
你是老鼠（告密者）吗 查莉
Are you a rat, Charlie?

608
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,804
什么
Eh?

609
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:39,181
他们拷问了我们一个小时
They grilled us for an hour.

610
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:41,350
你知道我们不喜欢猪（警察）
And you know we hate pigs.

611
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:43,477
和老鼠
And rats.

612
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:47,607
嘿嘿嘿
Hey, hey, hey.

613
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,651
我也不喜欢猪和老鼠
I hate pigs and rats, too.

614
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:52,486
还有蛇（小人）
And snakes.

615
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:56,240
中国生肖有一半我都不喜欢
Half the Chinese zodiac is no good in my book.

616
00:33:58,535 --> 00:34:01,454
两位 我还是我 查莉
Hey, guys, it's me, okay. It's Charlie.

617
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:03,831
我跟那人接触前不知道他是联调局的
I didn't know the guy was a fed until we started talking.

618
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,041
他突然就告诉了我
He just sprung it on me.

619
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,084
我不是告密的
BAYL} I'm no stoolie.

620
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,921
我要是知道市是谁
If I had known who Ben was,

621
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:11,255
我会离他远远的
I would have steered clear.

622
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:13,090
等等 你们为什么不直接告诉我
Wait, why didn't you just tell me,

623
00:34:13,175 --> 00:34:15,134
本就是加布里尔
you know, that, that Ben was Gabriel?

624
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:16,719
你觉得我们会作何感受
How do you think we feel? o

625
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,306
有天房门突然被敲开
Knocks on our door the other night, says,

626
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:23,601
那人说 我还活着 我背叛了你们俩
hey, I'm alive, and I betrayed you both.

627
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:27,730
对啊 那次什么情况
Geez. How'd that go?

628
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:29,774
我们告诉他 我们原谅他了
We told him we forgave him.

629
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:33,236
那就好
Hah. Good.

630
00:34:33,278 --> 00:34:36,280
原谅了 是啊
Forgiveness. Alright.

631
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,533
对了 有件事我挺想问问你们的
Oh, uh, I did want to ask you guys about this,

632
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:42,036
听起来有点疯狂 也许不是啥大事
this crazy thing, it's probably nothing.

633
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,288
很明显 你们当初打算
So apparently, you guys were going to,

634
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,915
炸掉一个儿童版的
I don't know, blow up some kind of

635
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:49,544
联合国之类的
United Nations for babies or something.

636
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,879
查莉 你一定要知道
Charlie, what you have to understand

637
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,631
上预科精英学校的学生
about these elite prep school kids,

638
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:54,966
他们都是当权
they were the offspring

639
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:57,552
法西斯分子的后代
of the reigning fascists of the day.

640
00:34:57,636 --> 00:34:59,595
我们想给下一代的战争罪犯
Joyce: And we wanted to send a message

641
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:04,225
表明一下态度
to the next generation of war criminals. o

642
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:08,104
明白了
I see.

643
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:10,231
我再问问清楚哈
Just to be crystal clear here,

644
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:13,484
你们是真的要
so, uh...we're talking about...

645
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:16,153
用炸弹炸死
blowing up high school kids?

646
00:35:16,154 --> 00:35:17,405
高中生吗
Like, with bombs?

647
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,700
当时时代不一样
It was a different time.

648
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,630
好吧
Alright.

649
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,425
我不得不承认
I got to say, I really feel like

650
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:39,260
我们之前略去了很多细节
we glossed over some details here.

651
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,971
你知道自己听上去
You know who you're beginhing

652
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:43,848
越来越像谁吗

00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:48,311
-贝蒂 -贝蒂
Betty. Betty.

654
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,355
好吧
Right.

655
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:53,649
我也不得不说
I got to say, you know,

656
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:56,319
你俩听上去越来越像曼森
you're starting to sound a lot less like Hoffman

657
00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:58,404
而不是霍夫曼呢
and a lot more like Manson, so

658
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:00,615
该死
Oh shit.

659
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:02,658
等等

真的杀了本吗
Did you kill Ben?

00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:12,251
你带窃听器了吗 查莉
You wearing a wire, Charlie?

663
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:16,547
喂 煞笔探员 滚犊子吧
Hey, Agent Fuckface. Go suck an egg.

664
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,674
别这样吼我的胸
念 Alright, man, stop talking to my tits.

665
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:20,426
你们知道吗
You know what? I

666
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,803
真的是 我以为你俩是一对儿
Fuck! I just I really thought you guys were, like,

667

为信仰而战
standing up for what you believe in

670
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,811
让混蛋付出代价的话
and holding the assholes accountable

671
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,660
原来 你们才是大混蛋
You're the assholes.

672
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,411
懂了
Got it.

673
00:37:03,595 --> 00:37:05,805
你和我想的一样吗
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

674
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,771
那是斯卡加尔德吗
Fletcher 1: Is that a Skarsgard?

675
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:15,690
你看谁都像斯卡加尔德
Fletcher 2: You think everyone is a Skarsgard.

676
00:37:15,732 --> 00:37:18,359
谁让他们长得那么帅
Well, everyone is a Skarsgard.

677
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,571
嘿你们看了很多犯罪谋杀剧对吗
Hey hey, you guys watch a lot of murder shows, right?

678
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:22,697
小声点
Fletchers: Shh!

679
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,574
抱歉 真的对不起
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry

680
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,285
我想问问
Uh, I was just wondering, um,

681
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,705
你们知道有什么容易购买
do you know of any easily accessible poisons

682
00:37:30,747 --> 00:37:33,875
还能不知不觉引发心脏病的毒药吗
that would trigger an undetectable heart attack?

683
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:36,711
氯化钾
Potassium chloride.

684
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:40,756

蓖麻毒素

这是人体天然的化合物
it's a naturally occurring compound in the body.

698
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:09,368
你要想靠尸检找到这玩意儿
Trying to find that in an autopsy,

699
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:11,495
根本不可能

705
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,767
用这个来种入麻
uses for her ganja situation.

706
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,769
天 她都拿这个干什么了
Man, what's she been doing with it?

707
00:38:34,811 --> 00:38:36,270
我周一给了她一周的量
I gave her a week's worth on Monday,

708
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,064
周三又给了一周的量
then another week's worth on Wednesday.

709
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,441
你跟她说别嗑太狠了
You tell her don't shoot that stuff.

710
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:41,734
会出问题的
It'll mess you up.

711
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:48,407
-假侄子 -查莉 嗨
Charlie: Fake nephew. - Charlie. Hey.

712
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,201
听着 如果我
So listen, ifI, uh

713
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:51,786
我有一些信息
if I had some information

714
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:54,455
和本的死有关的 这种事
about Ben's death, is that something,

715
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:57,208
你能保证不把我牵扯进来吗
like, could you keep my name out of the whole business?

716
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,169
可以我就是 我就是干证人保护这一行的
Yes, that's what I- - my job is literally witness protection.

717
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,255
我发现乔伊斯
It turns out that Joyce had access

718
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:05,007
在本被杀前一天拿到了硝酸钠
to some sodium nitrate the day before Ben was killed.

719
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,301
你最近保护的人被干掉了啊
Man: Oh. Your last guy got whacked?

720
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,511
什么情况 我这
What is that? Am I, uh...

721
00:39:08,595 --> 00:39:09,971
你是给我开外放了吗
Sorry, am I on speakerphone?

722
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,764
对 不是 那是公牛吉诺
Yes. No, that's Gino the Bull.

723
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,808
可能那都不是谋杀
It probably wasn't even murder.

724
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,810
可能 马龙
Probably? Marone

725
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:17,645
你这样我也不会
this ain't inspiring

726
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,105
对你有信心的啊
a lot of confidence, you know.

727
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:20,856
查莉 她们要怎么用硝酸钠
Luca: Charlie, how could they have killed him

728
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:22,316
来杀掉他啊
with sodium nitrate?

729
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,818
死亡时间是2点23分
Time of death was 2: 23.

730
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,695
她们当时和你一起在动物园
They were at the zoo with you.

731
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,824
2点23分
2: 23.

732
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,158
2 3 4 我靠
Two- two- three. Whoa!

733
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:33,536
兄弟 那是猴子的时间
Whoa, dude, dude, that's the time of the monkey.

734
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,954
什么的什么
What of the what?

735
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,415
就是动物园的猴子
Oh, th- th- th- the monkey at the zoo.

736
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,166
那个表演 它能表演说时间
The show, you know, it tells time.

737
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:41,460
梅兰妮 是梅兰妮 她可厉害了
Melanie. Melanie. She's amazing.

738
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,712
我看表演的时候
And when I saw this show,

739
00:39:42,796 --> 00:39:44,589
猴子说的时间就是2点23分
the time the monkey told was 2: 23.

740
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:46,465
这也太巧了吧
That's a weird coincidence, huh?

741
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:48,134
就是说
Uh, I mean,

742
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,177
你觉得她会不会
do you think that maybe she's, uh...

743
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,179
她会不会有某种猴子预知能力
you think she's some kind of a monkey pre- cog?

744
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:55,808
预知能力 你是说猴子版的《少数派报告》吗
Pre- cog. Like"Minority Report" with monkeys?

745
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,560
我不是这么觉得
No, I do not.

746
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,145
但那部电影我还挺想看的
I would watch that movie, though.

747
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,730
等等等等 不是
Charlie: Wait, wait, wait. No.

748
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:02,732
乔伊斯和艾琳她们没看表演
So, Joyce and Irene, they skipped the show.

749
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,275
操 对啊 她们可以
Fuck, yes, they could have...

750
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,777
靠 不对 她们没时间开车回来
Ah shit, no, it's not enough time for the drive,

751
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,156
但她们可能伪造了死亡时间
but maybe they faked the time of death.

752
00:40:10,198 --> 00:40:12,366
查莉 记得我怎么说那俩人的吗
Luca: Charlie, remember what I said about those two?

753
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:13,701
-小心她们俩 -比利
Be careful with those two- - - Yeah. Hey, Billy!

754
00:40:13,785 --> 00:40:14,869
我等会儿给你回电话
Let me call you back, okay.

755
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,205
比利 你好
Billy. Hey, how you been?

756
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,124
我想问能不能
I was wondering, could I get a quick peek

757
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,044
看看本的手环数据呢
at the data from Ben's robo- arm- bracelet?

758
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:25,421
不行 那就违反健保与责任法案了
No, absolutely not. That'd be a HIPAA violation.

759
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:28,424
行 虽然我听不懂你说啥
Oh yeah, and I'm hip- a to what you're saying.

760
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,260
但就这一次行吗
But, uh, maybe just this once

761
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,596
好吧
Okay.

762
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,931
-我不该怎么干的 但还是行吧 -谢谢你
I shouldn't be doing this, but okay. - Thank you.

763
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,557
你看 这是全部记录
Look, you can see the whole story.

764
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,684
他的心率在2点23分飙升
He had a cardiac spike at 2: 23,

765
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:39,936
z40
然后体征就没了
and then the vitals just stopped.

766
00:40:39,978 --> 00:40:41,354
oP
在那之后 我们试图给他除颤
And after that, we tried to defib him,

767
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:42,730
但他已经死了
but he was already gone.

768
00:40:42,814 --> 00:40:45,566
我问你件事 这有没有可能
Let me ask you something, is it possible to, uh,

769
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,235
是伪造的
I don't know, fake this?

770
00:40:47,277 --> 00:40:49,445
这能不能被篡改啊
Like, could you go in and change it?

771
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:51,155
不行 这数据没法改
No, no, it's hard data. - Huh.

772
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,076
这个 11点10分的小变化是什么
What's this, this blip at 11: 10?

773
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:57,662
-可能他被吓到了 -不 你看
Billy: Maybe he was startled. Charlie: No, but look.

774
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,748
我是说心率变了
I mean, the heartbeat, it changes.

775
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,085
速度和力量都不一样
I mean, it's a different speed, strength.

776
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,587
好像换了颗心脏一样
It's almost like he switched hearts or something.

777
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,838
好奇怪
That is weird.

778
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:09,674
TZU
58 81 58 I
11点10分
Charlie: 11: 10

779
00:41:09,716 --> 00:41:11,634
120
58 81 120
正好是我们出发
That's right around when we were leaving

780
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,885
去动物园的时候
for the zoo.

781
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,017
她拉屎的事都扯了半天
She bullshitted about shitting.

782
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,770
卢卡 你准备好听顶级推理了吗
Alright, Luca, are you ready for some grade- A figuring?

783
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,939
她顺着植物架爬了上去
So she climbed up the plant ladder,

784
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,275
换掉了手环 在11点10分杀了他
swapped out the heartcuff, killed him at 11: 10.

785
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:30,236
然后她爬了下来 去了动物园
Then she climbed back down, went to the zoo,

786
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,989
然后在猴子表演韵时候假装了心率飙升
and faked the cardiac spike during the monkey show.

787
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,157
-乒乓嘭 -是乒啪嗒嘭
Bing- bang- boom. - Bing- bada- boom.

788
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,451
-这太疯狂了 -但是有可能
- It's nuts. - Charlie: But plausible.

789
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,120
可能也不能帮我们申请到逮捕令啊
Plausible's not grounds for an arrest warrant.

790
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:41,914
要我信你并行动
I need something hard and firm

791
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,207
我需要切实的证据
ifI'm going to ride this one.

792
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,960
现在我们才有得聊
Now you're speaking my language.

793
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,378
还有 查理 如果你说的是对的
Luca: Also, Charlie, for this theory to work,

794
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,130
那乔伊斯或者艾琳
either Joyce or Irene would have needed

795
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:50,464
需要制造出心脏病发的假象
to simulate a heart attack.

796
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:51,549
我看了飙升的心率图
I looked at that spike.

797
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,967
这不是单纯开合跳跳就能有的
That isn't doing jumping jacks.

798
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,635
那是真的心脏病发
That's a real cardiac event.

799
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,137
我不知道这要怎么假装
I don't know how you fake that.

800
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,764
我等会儿给你回电话
I gotta get back to you.

801
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:04,145
皮特 我问你个问题
Heya, Pete, uh, let me ask you a question.

802
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,231
你懂性爱电击的事吗
Do you know anything about sexual zapping?

803
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,235
你说的这是电击情趣
You speak of electro- play.

804
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,487
好变态的 我绝对不要
Kinky stuff. Not for the faint of heart.

805
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,574
你只需要一个电击枪 还有开放的心态
AII you need is a taser and an open mind.

806
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,957
-嗨 -贝蒂
Hello? Charlie: Uh, Betty.

807
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,500
是你老朋友查莉
Uh, it's your old friend Charlie.

808
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,169
有什么事
Oh. What do you want?

809
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,004
听着 我觉得你说的
Oh, listen, I think you might have been right

810
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,714
乔伊斯和艾琳的事没错
about, uh, Joyce and Irene.

811
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,049
我早说了
Betty: I told you.

812
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:35,051
-又是重刑犯又是瘾君子 -我知道
Felons and junkies. Charlie: Yeah, yeah, I know.

813
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,304
听着 我需要知道你在动物园看到了什么
Listen, I, I need to know what you saw at the zoo.

814
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,890
你提到了一个什么性爱电击
You mentioned something about a sexual zapping.

815
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,225
对
Betty: Well, yes.

816
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,435
我当时正在像正常人一样买帽子
I was buying a hat like a normal person

817
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:48,356
然后我看到乔伊斯和艾琳鬼鬼祟祟的
when I saw Joyce and Irene looking extra suspicious.

818
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,360
她们在暖房里给彼此安慰
They were in the hothouse pleasuring each other

819
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:53,986
用某种电动老二
with some kind of electro- dildo.

820
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:58,574
更糟糕的是我错过了猴子表演
And the worst of it is I missed the monkey show,

821
00:42:58,575 --> 00:43:00,701
我就是为了那个表演
which was the whole reason that I organized

822
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,246
才组织去动物园的
the trip in the first place.

823
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:06,165
贝蒂 这就对了 我们抓到她们了
Betty, that's it. That's it. I think we got'em.

824
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,626
我好开心终于有人听我说了
I'm glad somebody is finally listening.

825
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,545
我今早就跟艾琳说了
Like I told Irene this morning,

826
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,255
你不能在动物园
"The zoo is no place

827
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,258
玩那些变态的SM技巧
"to practice your twisted masochistic fetishes,

828
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,886
联邦调查局的人会知道的
and the FBI will hear about it.

829
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,556
等等 贝蒂 你和艾琳说了吗
Wait, Betty, you told Irene all this.

830
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,558
一个小时以前啊
Uh, just an hour ago.

831
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,228
等一下 查莉
Hold on just a minute, Charlie.

832
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,314
我的压力锅的声音好奇怪等等
My Instapot is making funny noises. Hold on.

833
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,400
压力锅 别别别 贝蒂
Pressure cooker. No, no, Betty.

834
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:33,818
贝蒂 你得赶紧离开
Betty, you got to get out of there.

835
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,570
贝蒂 贝蒂
Betty! Betty!

836
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:36,779
快走
Evacuate!

837
00:43:53,755 --> 00:43:55,047
你好蠢
Joyce: You're so silly.

838
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,340
-我的天 -我的天
Irene Oh God. - Joyce: Oh, my God.

839
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,801
我觉得我们可能太冒险了
Ooh I think we may be pushing our luck.

840
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,887
你准备好换换景色了吗
You up for a change of scenery?

841
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,306
你觉得玻利维亚那里
Look, you think they got, uh, senior

842
00:44:03,348 --> 00:44:05,016
有养老院吗
living in Bolivia?

843
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,855
查莉
Charlie.

844
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,326
你有事吗
How can we help you?

845
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,828
贝蒂全都告诉我了
Betty told me everything,

846
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,705
她看到你们俩
uh, about how she saw you two

847
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,958
在暖房里电击彼此
tasing each other in the hothouse.

848
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,294
你们就是这样骗到了护士
That's how you tricked the nurses into thinking

849
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,005
让他们以为本心脏病发了
that Ben was having a heart attack

850
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:40,426
但他其实已经死了好几个小时了
uh, when he'd really been dead for hours

851
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:44,305
很聪明 但你们漏过了一个小细节
Pretty clever. But you missed one detail.

852
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,766
什么小细节
What might that be?

853
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:50,811
本的心率监控器在你们
Ben's heart monitor recording went totally flat

854
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,731
在2点23分玩了电击之后
after your tasing stunt

855
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:55,358
就彻底平了
at 2: 23.

856
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,985
猴子的时间  
The time of the monkey.

857
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,281
但是护士们曾经试图给他除颤
But the nurses tried to revive him with a defibrillator.

858
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,284
如果他当时带着的真的是自己的手环
If he'd really been wearing his heartcuff monitor,

859
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,662
那应该会记录下电击
it would have registered those shocks.

860
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,541
你还挺会说
Ain't that some shit. - Mm- hmm.

861
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,335
你说这么多就为了那个
And all this for a motherfucker

862
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,629
让我们蹲了30年大牢的混蛋吗
who sent us to prison for 30 years?

863
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,839
你们当时就是罪有应得
You deserved it then

864
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,716
现在依然是
and you deserve it now.

865
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,886
收好你们的沙壶球吧 女士们
Wax up your shuffleboard pucks, ladies.

866

Yeah, man, you're going right back to Bedford.

869
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:39,235
所以这些你还没告诉他吗
So you haven t told him all of this yet?

870
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,074
