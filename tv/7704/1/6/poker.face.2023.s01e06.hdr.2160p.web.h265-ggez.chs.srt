1
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,149
老天 迈克
Woman: Jesus, Michael.

2
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:07,236
你是想跟神龛聊聊吗
You want to Gram with the shrine?

3
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:09,655
不 不用了
Woman No Tm uh. I'm good.

4
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:18,080
凯瑟琳
Well, Kathleen.

00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,249
-欢迎来到享乐生活 -行吧
Welcome to the life Kathleen: Mm- hmm

6
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,626
嗨 亲爱的
Hey, sweetheart

7
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:25,629
凯瑟林 这是我太太艾娃
Kathleen, I'd love for youi to meet my wife, Ava.

8
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:28,090
艾娃 这是我的宿敌
Ava, I'd like for you to meet my mortal enemy,

9
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,174
凯瑟琳·汤森
Kathleen Townsend.

10
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:30,259
凯瑟琳
Ava: Kathleen

11
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:32,803
很高兴终于能见到你了
It is a pleasure to finally meet you.

12
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:36,431
我也一样
Well, likewise. Likewise.

13
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:39,434
-恭喜啊 新婚夫妻 -谢谢你
Congratulations, newlyweds Michael and Ava: Thank you.

14
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:43,689
忘年恋总是让我觉得暖暖的
A May December romance really warms my heart.

15
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:45,691
你真是太好了
that's so sweet.

16
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,776
-而且你看上去好美 -谢谢你
And you look wonderful, by the way Thank you,

17
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,363
我记得这一套是第六季的衣服吧
I think I recognize that outfit from season six

18
00:01:51,406 --> 00:01:52,739
好吧 那你们俩慢慢叙旧
Okay, well, I will leave the two of you to catch up.

19
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,783
好吧 那你们俩慢慢叙旧
Okay, well, Lwill leave the two of you to catch up.

20
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:56,410
表现好一点
Behave

21
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:00,414
恭喜你
Congratulations.

22
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,166
还不错啊
Not bad

23
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:03,375
一年前
Imean, a year ago,

24
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:05,711
你还在跟会说话的海狸
you were doing insurance commercials

25
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:06,879
拍保险广告
with talking beavers.

26
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,589
现在 你住这么大房子
And now, now you have all this

27
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,008
她是家里有矿吗
She have family money?

28
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,428
不 艾娃完全是靠自己
Oh no. Ava is 100%self- made

29
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:18,015
她创建了专属女性的在线折扣经纪
She founded a discount online brokerage for women

30
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:19,349
她之交易
She Trade.

31
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:22,644
所以这对我来说是相当享受了
So this is a treat,

32
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:25,022
你销声匿迹三年
After three years radio silence

33
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:27,441
怎么突然跑来了 赎罪的其中一步吗
What is this? Some kind of 12 Step thing?

34
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:30,611
你是在戒断愤怒吗 所以来补偿我的
You're a rage- a- holic? You here to make amends?

35
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:31,570
不是
No.

36
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:34,239
这对我来说并不容易 迈克
This isn't easy for me, Michael

37
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:36,742
我知道我们过去伤害过彼此
I know that we have hurt each other in the past.

38
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:39,703
我知道我把你伤得很重
I know that I have hurt you terribly.

39
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:43,332
但我需要请你帮个忙
But I have to ask you fora favor.

40
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:49,254
我希望你能跟我一起演一场戏
I want you to do a play with me.

41
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:53,717
笑什么 就一晚上在地方剧院
What? It's one night only. Regional theater.

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,511
但他们很有钱
Oh, but they have very deep pockets.

43
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:58,347
我觉得那边有些捐赠者是《幽灵》的狂热粉丝
I think some of the donors are big"Spooky"fans actually

44
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:00,808
他们的价钱开得很高
They offered big money.

45
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,267
什么戏
What's the play?

46
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,811
《彭萨科拉的幽灵》
"The Ghosts of Pensacola. "

47
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:08,190
听我说 就算是30年前 那玩意儿也是烂透的
Ugh. Listen, even 30 years ago, that mope- fest sucked.

48
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,734
那是我们职业生涯中得到的最高评价了
Those were the best reviews of our career.

49
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:12,319
那标准可太低了
It's a low bar.

50
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:13,403
迈克 你知不知道
Michael, do you know

51
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:15,531
如果你明天就死了
that if you died tomorrow,

52
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:17,282
那么留在大家心中的
you would be remembered

53
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:19,159
就是《幽灵与警察》里面的你
for Spooky and the Cop.

54
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:20,494
那真是好极了
Michael: Well, that's great.

55
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:22,996
说明我给很多人带去了快乐
That means I provided joy to a lot of people.

56
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,332
你是个艺肃家
You are an artist.

57
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,709
你是天生的艺市家
It rages in your blood.

58
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:29,419
我了解你的灵魂
I know your soul.

59
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:34,341
我记得你在舞台上的激情
I remember what the fire was like on that stage.

60
00:03:34,384 --> 00:03:36,093
我觉得你太夸张了 亲爱的
Okay, I think you're overselling it, darling.

61
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:38,053
在我们成功之前
The primal connection we had

62
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:39,721
在我们闹翻和出丑闻之前
before the success,

63
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:42,599
我们所拥有的那种原始的联系
before the feuds and the tabloids.

64
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:45,144
是啊 你还在《人民》杂志的采访里
Oh yeah, and the "People" magazine interview

65
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:46,895
暗示我不认字呢
where you implied that I couldn't read.

66
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:48,105
我道过歉了
I said I was sorry.

67
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:49,898
我的维基有科上还有着一条
It's still on my Wikipedia page.

68
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:52,901
一整条条目 说我文盲
There's a whole subheading. "Illiteracy. "

69
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:55,904
迈克 我现在很绝望
Michael, Im desperate.

70
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:58,073
求你了 我真的求你了
Please, I'm begging you.

71
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,950
你要我做什么都可以
I will do anything you want.

72
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:02,202
让我公开下跪都可以
I will prostrate myself publicly.

73
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:04,830
但我真的很需要这一次
But I need this.

74
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:08,250
你知道业界对特定年纪的女演员来说是什么样的吗
Do you know what it's like for an actress of a certain age?

75
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:10,502
从演妈妈 到演参议院
You go from mom to senator

76
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,588
再到演痴呆患者
to dementia patient.

77
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,047
我真的很需要那笔钱
And, and I need the money.

78
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:14,798
我真的很需要那笔钱
And, and I need the money

79
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,722
那很抱歉 凯瑟琳 我还是拒绝
Well, I'msorry, Kathleen. The answer's no.

80
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:23,098
好吗
Okay.

81
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,225
但如果你需要现金的话 我可以 我可以问问艾娃
But if you need some cash, I could, I could ask Ava.

82
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:26,727
操你妈
Oh, fuck you!

83
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:31,857
也去你妈的 小婊子
And fuck you, bitchtv

84
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:34,943
都他妈烂人
Fuckin' motherfuckers!

85
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:36,987
-肏 -我的天
Fuck! Ava: Jesus Christ.

86
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,614
都是烂人
Kathleen: Motherfucker!

87
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:40,532
我的天
Oh God.

88
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,951
迈克 我说了多少次了
Ava: Michael, I keep asking you

89
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:43,994
你得带着药
to keep your pills on you.

90
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:45,454
要是我不在这儿怎么办
What if I'm not here?

91
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:46,622
-艾娃 -你的心脏
Ava- - - Your heart.

92
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:47,789
只是一见到凯瑟琳
It's just seeing Kathleen

93
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:50,292
我的血压就飙升
makes my blood pressure spike.

94
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:52,836
我去找 让马克给我按摩一下
I'll get a massage from Jean Marc.

95
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:56,006
亲爱的
Darling

96
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:57,216


97
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:58,759
或许你应该重新考虑下
Perhaps you should reconsider.

98
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,343


99
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:01,762
我有点担心
I worry.

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,474
我的钱 我的事业
You know, my money, my career,

101
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,935
还有这一切
all of...this.

102
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:10,979
你想念镁光灯了
You miss the limelight.

103
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:14,483
但我不想和凯瑟琳一起
But with Kathleen?

104
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,235
拜托
Oh, come on.

105
00:05:16,277 --> 00:05:18,529
那都是30年前的事了
It was 30 years ago.

106
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,989
你们肯定都成熟了不少
I'm sure you've both grown since then.

107
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:27,538
你这个爱操纵人 撒谎成性的泼妇
You manipulating, lying shrew!

108
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,165
成熟点吧 你现在是小白脸了
Oh, grow up, you re a kept man.

109
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,210
早该习惯接受女人的指令了
You should be used to taking direction from a woman.

110
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:34,336
我是绝对不可能
There is no way

111
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,380
让你来指导这出戏的
I'm letting you direct this damn play!

112
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:37,673
那真是不好意思了 我就是导演
Whoops, I am.

113
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:39,133
如果你看过合同
And you would have known that

114
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:40,425
或者让别人给你读过合同
had you read your contract

115
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:42,219
你就会清楚这一点
or had someone read it to you.

116
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:45,639
好极了 我这是在地狱里吧
Oh, okay, great. I'm in hell!

117
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:47,099
赶紧把这条狗给我弄走
And get this dog off the stage

118
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:48,559
不然它就要被我当球踢了
before I kick it for three points.

119
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:50,185
过来 福斯
Come here, Fosse.

120
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:51,562
请问可以先讨论一下
Woman: Um, could we possibly discuss

121
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:53,522
我这个角色的畸形足问题吗
my character's clubfoot for just a moment?

122
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,524
如果能有真正畸形足的人来指导
Because I would feel personally a lot more comfortable

123
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,526
我个人觉得公
if somebody from the clubfoot community

124
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:58,861
更好一点
were advising.

125
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:00,445
-我的天 认真的吗 -是啊
Oh God. Really? Rebecca: Yeah.

126
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:03,031
你只要瘸着走就可以了 亲爱的
Kathleen: Just get out there and hobble, honey.

127
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,700
这是午餐菜单先生
That's the lunch menu, sir.

128
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:09,246
给我来个总会三明治 再来把枪
I'll have a club sandwich with a side order of a gun.

129
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:12,541
还有 哈里 希望不会太麻烦你
Um, uh, and also, Harry, if it's not too much trouble,

130
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:15,878
谢谢 我想要一杯木槿茶好吗
thanks, could you get me a hibiscus tea, please?

131
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,880
加奶 但不要杏仁奶
With milk. Um, but not almond milk.

132
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:19,381
我知道大家都爱喝 但我对
I know people like it, but I'm allergic

133
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:21,425
所有坚果和豆类都过敏
to all tree nuts and legumes, actually.

134
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:23,844
-我想也是 -我真的是
Of course, you are. Well, no, I am.

135
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:25,596
所以如果那些狗零食是用花生做的
So if those dog treats are peanut- based,

136
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:26,722
因为那闻起来很像是花生做的
because they smell peanut- based

137
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:28,056
上面也写着花生酱
and they say peanut butter on them,

138
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,726
我就真的可能出现过敏性休克
I could go into anaphylactic shock actually.

139
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:34,021
等下 那他妈是什么
Hold on. What the fuck is that?

140
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:35,397
什么
What?

141
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,566
你大腿上那个
That thing on your lap.

142
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:38,901
那是什么
What is it?

143
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:42,696
我的剧本吗
My script?

144
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,573
你需要一个会脱稿的人
Would you like a representative

145
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:48,285
来指导一下你吗
of the off- book community present?

146
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:51,205
这不是你玩的抖音 小鬼
You know, this is not a TikTok, baby.

147
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:53,415
这是我的舞台
This is my stagel

148
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:58,462
你背不出台词还演什么戏啊
And you show up knowing your goddamn lines.

149
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,547
该死的年轻人
These fucking millennials.

150
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,090
不用担心 你做得很好了
Don't worry. You re doing great.

151
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:04,384
你坚持的时间已经超过约翰·斯塔莫斯了
You've already lasted longer than John Stamos.

152
00:07:04,427 --> 00:07:07,137
我的舞台监督比尔呢
Where is my stage manager Bill?

153
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,639
-是菲尔 -好 比尔
Phil. Kathleen: Okay, Bill,

154
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:10,891
我们要按照1991年的样子
we are going to run this play

155
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:14,269
完全复刻这台戏
the exact same way we did in 1991.

156
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:17,606
最后一幕
The timing on my trapdoor exit

157
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,024
我从活板门离开的时机
at the finale

158
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:22,486
必须完全一致
must be exactly the same.

159
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,614
我们现在不用活板门下人了
Well, we don't do trapdoor drops anymore.

160
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:26,740
这不安全
It, it isn't safe.

161
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:28,784
掉下去就是15英尺深
There's a 15- foot drop down

162
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:31,578
直接到混凝土地面上 按照会规
to a concrete floor underneath, and union regulations state- -

163
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:36,542
我有一年每天晚上都那么摔
Okay, I did that drop every night for one year.

164
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:38,961
用弗兰克·里奇的话说 这就是有效的
Frank Rich called it"effective"

165
00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:42,214
那是很久
Okay, well, that was a long time, uh, uh

166
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,848
你说啊 以前
Say the word"ago. "

167
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:54,726
说啊
Kathleen: Go ahead.

168
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,980
我要你说出来
: I want you to.

169
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:02,985
我会尽量做得安全
I'll make it as safe as I can.

170
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,778
这不怪你 菲尔
Don't knock yourself out, Phil.

171
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:06,655
好了 所有人 快点
Kathleen: Okay, everyone, come on.

172
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:10,075
我们有四天时间来实现奇迹
We have four days to make magic happen here.

173
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:11,994
各就各位
Places, everybody.

174
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:16,165
就位
Places.

175
00:08:32,682 --> 00:08:35,142
好了 各位 复习一下
Kathleen: Okay, people, to review- -

176
00:08:36,144 --> 00:08:39,980
每次有军用飞机飞过
Every time a military jet flies over,

177
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:43,650
舞台上的东西都得抖起来
I want everything on this stage to shake.

178
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:45,861
抖起来 明白了吗 全部
Shakel You got it. Everything.

179
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:49,031
-明白 -在第三遍飞过的时候
Crew Member Yes, ma'am. Now, on the third flyover,

180
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:51,909
那就是准备要进迈克的独白了
that is the cue for Michael's monologue.

181
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:53,869
如果他能瞄准的话
If he can manage to hit his mark.

182
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:55,913
这够大吗 你看得见吗
Is that big enough? Can you see it?

183
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:59,666
好了 比尔
Okay. Now, Bill

184
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,711
比尔 我要过一遍我的独白
Bill, I would like to run through my monologue

185
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:05,464
直到最后 直到活板门下落
all the way till the end till the trapdoor fall.

186
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:07,049
我是菲尔
: It's Phil.

187
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:09,802
都准备好了 一切就绪
Yeah, we're ready! Everything's good!

188
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:13,305
彭萨科拉的那年冬天很冷
Kathleen: It was cold in Pensacola that winter.

189
00:09:13,348 --> 00:09:15,557
冷得不自然
Unnatural cold.

190
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,312
来得太早的霜迟迟不肯离去
Frost that comes too soon and stays too long.

191
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:22,022
可能永远不会离去
Maybe forever.

192
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:25,359
雾气升起
The mist rises up and...

193
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:26,652
别动
Don't move!

194
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:34,034
雾气升起 遮盖住你的脚面
The mist rises up and covers your toes.

195
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:35,327
然后到腰
Then your waist.

196
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:39,790
那波浪
The waves

197
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,710
想要延伸到云端
They want to meet the clouds.

198
00:09:43,753 --> 00:09:46,839
母亲和孩子伸出手
The mother and child reaching out.

199
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,799
寻找彼此
...for each other...

200
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,469
操你妈的
Oh, goddamn you!

201
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:55,430
-搞什么啊 -凯瑟琳
What the hell...- Hey, Kathleen.

202
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:57,933
你过去之后能不能帮我
Why don't you grab me some extra thousand island dressing

203
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,393
多拿点千岛酱过来
while you're back there.

204
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:03,355
-我靠 -垫子到位了
Son of a bitch! - Mats work.

205
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:07,818
-喂 -搞什么
Hey. Kathleen: What?

206
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:10,445
我差点摔断脖子
I almost broke my goddamn neck!

207
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:13,448
-我受够了 我不干了 -很好
I'm done. I'm out. I quit. - Good.

208
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:15,284
你现在走 就要付给我
You walk out now, you're on the hook

209
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:18,287
20万违约金
for a $200, 000 kill fee.

210
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:20,956
所以不如你先找你老婆聊聊
So maybe you want to talk to your wife about it first.

211
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,791
毕竟是她给你发零花钱
The one who pays your allowance.

212
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,877
20万也值了
It's worth every penny!

213
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,920
我倒是没有这么肯定
Kathleen: You know, I'm not so sure,

214
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:28,630
因为如果她知道
because I think if she knew

215
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:31,675
你的那些风流事了 可能就不会给你钱了
about all your dalliances, maybe not so much.

216
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:34,636
行啊 你想跟我同归于尽是吧
Alright. You want some mutually- assured destruction?

217
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,971
-是啊 -没问题
- Yeah. - I got you, baby.

218
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:38,140
-放马过来吧 -因为我正在写回忆录
Bring it. - Because I m working on my memoirs,

219
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:40,434
我有一整章来写
and I got a whole chapter about

220
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:42,144
阿卡普尔科
: ...Acapulco.

221
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:44,938
你签了保密协议的
You signed an NDA.

222
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:48,734
现在我无所畏惧了
Yeah, well, now I got NFs to G.

223
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:50,235
懂吗 我会陪你演完这场戏
Alright, I'll do your damn play,

224
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:53,280
但我告诉你 你的末日就要来了
but I tell you this- the doomsday clock is ticking.

225
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:55,824
今晚幕布落下的时候
And when the curtains drop on this play tonight,

226
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:58,076
你就可以和演员生涯告别了
you can kiss your career goodbye.

227
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:00,204
建议你看看你的婚前协议
You might want to check your prenup.

228
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:02,706
因为明天
Because tomorrow,

229
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,584
艾娃会收到一封邮件
Ava is getting a little info in the mail

230
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:08,712
有关那个柴娜的
about Chyna with a"Y. "

231
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:11,298
我不开玩笑
I'm not bluffing.

232
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,008
我知道
I know.

233
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:14,927
你演技不够好
You're not a good enough actor.

234
00:11:49,254 --> 00:11:51,880
好了 还有5分钟开演 各位 5分钟
Okay Five minutes to call, people. Five minutes.

235
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:53,298
-找到了 -谢谢你
- Found it. - Thank you.

236
00:11:53,341 --> 00:11:54,842
我给你弄了个前排座位
Michael: I got you a seat right up front

237
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:56,301
这样我能看到你
so I can see you.

238
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:57,469
我真幸运
Lucky me.

239
00:11:58,388 --> 00:11:59,888
祝你好运
Break a leg.

240
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:03,100

我想谢谢你
I just wanted to thank you.

242
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:06,311

Sorry?

243
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:09,022
我知道是你说服迈克
Well, I know that you convinced Michael

244
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:11,733
和我一起演戏的 所以

246
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:16,238
凯瑟琳
Oh, Kathleen. Oh.

247
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:19,283
我知道跟你合作的噩梦程度
No, see, I knew that working with you would be

248
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:22,703
绝对能彻底消灭
such a fucking nightmare that it would kill off

249
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,663
迈克演戏的念头
Michael's silly little acting bug

250
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:27,332
一劳永逸 这不就成了
once and for all, and voila.

251
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,835
所以 谢谢你才对
So, thank you. -

252
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:31,128
疯子
Psycho.

253
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,970
那婊子的牙都不齐
That bitch's teeth don't even match.

254
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:42,514
这他妈搞什么呢
The fuck is going on here?

255
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:43,849
祝你好运 迈克
Break a leg, Michael.

256
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,934
最好别让凯瑟琳看到你拿着这些
Better not let Kathleen catch you with those.

257
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:47,186
她能怎么 炒我鱿鱼吗
What is she going to do, fire me?

258
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:49,313
那我求之不得
A man can dream.

259
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,001
雄猫战斗机吗
Tomcat?

260
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:13,629
不 那是幻影
No, that's a Phantom.

261
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,548
真不知道他们何必费这么犬力气
Don't know why they bother.

262
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:20,093
他们说士兵们圣诞节前就能回家了
They say our boys will be home by Christmas.

263
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:22,012
你怕什么
Michael: What are you afraid of?

264
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:24,014
她会变成什么样
Kathleen: What will become of her?

265
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:27,059
我怕她内心
I'm afraid that, that she has

266
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:30,896
有太多我们的影子
too much of both of us inside her.

267
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:34,691
我怕她铁石心肠
I'm afraid that she has a gunmetal heart.

268
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:36,401
就像你一样
Like you.

269
00:13:39,864 --> 00:13:43,408
夏天 感觉就像冬天
Summer felt like winter

270
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,327
感觉就像春天
felt like spring.

271
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,120
该死的骗子
Fucking hack!

272
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:49,581
这男人太可悲了
Pathetic excuse for a man.

273
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:51,834
你个臭女人
You ball- busting harpy.

274
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:58,799
去他妈的烂货
Goddamn son of a fucking piece of shit.

275
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,510
老掉牙的过气女星
Michael: You washed- up has- been.

276
00:14:01,553 --> 00:14:04,054
你这可悲的挑剔混蛋
Kathleen: You pathetic preening prick!

277
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:06,890
你太失败了
You are such a failure.

278
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:08,559
你觉得你是个女演员吗
You think you're an actress?

279
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:09,434
你就是个笑话
You're a joke.

280
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:13,564
你就是个活生生的失败作品
A lying, philandering failure.

281
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,941
整个剧组以前都在笑你 
The whole crew used to laugh at you.

282
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:17,943
还女演员呢 就一破烂货
Actress? More like hacktress.

283
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:20,863
你个无能的傻子
Kathleen: You impotent baby.

284
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:24,366
我到底是怎么忍你这么多年的
How the fuck did I put up with you all these years?

285
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,289
你这皱巴巴的老太婆
Michael: You shriveled prune. Ah, ah!

286
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:33,959
不如你的鸡巴那么皱巴巴
Kathleen: Not as shriveled as your tiny little dick!

287
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:35,210
混蛋
Asshole.

288
00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:41,675
你这狂妄 背后捅刀的贱人
You vain, backstabbing hag.

289
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:48,390
这是什么样的上帝
What kind of god!

290
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,350
鲍比
Bobby.

291
00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:54,188
鲍比 我希望我的心能够翱翔
Bobby, I want my heart to soar.

292
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,316
我要在你坟头跳舞
I will dance on your grave.

293
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:59,359
我要在你坟头撒尿
I'll piss on your grave.

294
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:09,828
感觉风暴快要来子
Kathleen: It feels like a storm is brewin'.

295
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:12,080
你关窗了吗 亲爱的
Did you close the windows, sweetheart?

296
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:20,589
宝贝 我今天在超市看到克劳福德家的小伙子了
Oh baby. I saw the Crawford boy down the supermarket today.

297

他现在在基地工作了
He works at the base now.

298
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:32,851
-别说了 妈 -别说什么
Rebecca: Stop it, Mama. - Kathleen: Stop what?

299
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:34,561
别说了 别以为
Stop it! Just stop thinking

300
00:15:34,604 --> 00:15:37,064
还会有男人要我
that any man would ever want me.

301
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:40,275
不 我不是说你的脚

303
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,657
人总说彭萨科拉有两种人
They say that there are two types of men in Pensacola:

304
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:50,118
飞行员 和让他们能上天的人
pilots, and the men who keep'em up in the air.

305
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:54,373
如果你忘了 他们会提醒你
And if you forget, they'll remind you.

306
00:15:54,415 --> 00:15:57,209
有些人说这就是为什么飞机飞得那么低
Some folks say that that's why they fly their jets so low.

307
00:15:57,252 --> 00:15:59,670
让我们打翻早晨的咖啡
Make us spill our morning coffee.

308
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:04,007
永远带着恐惧
Always looking up at the skies

309
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,425
仰望天空
in fear.

310
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:08,137
为了保证我们在自己的位置上
Just to keep us in our place.

你们单独聊聊吧
Oh, I'll give you guys some privacy.

321
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:53,599
我只是想说 《幽灵与警察》
I just want you to know that "Spooky and the Cop"

322
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:55,809
是我选择成为执法人员的理由
made me choose a career in law enforcement.

323
00:16:55,852 --> 00:16:58,687
谢谢你 这话我真的听了太多次了
Thank you. I can't tell you how many times I've heard that.

324
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,871
那是这辈子的最佳演出
That was the performance of a lifetime.

325

我们做到了
We did it.

328
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:32,054
拜托 你往顾客身上扔小费了
Come on, you threw a tip at a customer.

329
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:33,138
那就一毛而已
You know what, it was a dime.

330
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:34,389
你还吃了别人的培根
And you ate someone's bacon.

331
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:35,974
他们无视我
They were ignoring me.

332
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:38,519
你是我招到过的最差的服务生
You are the worst waitress I've ever had.

333
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:40,979
我可是绿色地带开过老乡村店的
And I ran a Cracker Barrel in the Green Zone.

334
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,648
最后一句完全没必要
That last part was unnecessary.

335
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,650
但还是谢谢你的付出
But thank you for your service.

336

行吧 天啊
Okay. God.

虽然是被解雇了吧
Well, as firings go,

338
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:56,662
但我也确实干得不怎么样
hardly my best work.

339
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,248
对日场的人来说还不错
Not bad for a matinee

340
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,541
你知道还有哪里
You happen to know anyplace else

341
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,292
招低水平服务生的吗
that's looking for a subpar waitress

342
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:05,587
不要简历和推荐信的那种
that doesn't require paperwork or references?

343
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,383
还真有 工作时间减半 小费不错
Well, actually, half hours, good tips.

没有福利
Mm, no benefits.

345
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:13,554
看时节的活 付的现金
Seasonal work, so it pays cash.

346
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:16,473
如果你有兴趣 我可以帮你说几句好话
I can put in a good word for you if you're interested.

347
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:18,934
听着还挺完美的
Well, that actually sounds pretty perfect.

348
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:19,977

这都是真的 而你
Truth, truth, truth. Now, you.

421
00:21:47,477 --> 00:21:49,394
我碰巧在你大吼的时候
Uh, well, I did happen to catch

422
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:51,230
听到了几个词
a few words through the rainstorm.

423
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:54,274
我跟你说实话我一个字都不信你
And I'll tell you the truth, I didn't believe a single word.

424
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:57,861
甚至可以说 这是我这辈子
In fact, I would say that that's maybe the biggest batch

425
00:21:57,904 --> 00:21:59,738
我这一辈子里听到过的
of bullshit I've heard in my whole,

426
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:01,448
最大的谎话
yeah, whole entire life.

427
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:04,618
老天
Jesus.

428
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,454
我明白了 我自己滚出去
I get it. I'll see myself out.

429
00:22:07,497 --> 00:22:10,666
已经有30年没人这么跟我说话了
I haven't been spoken to that way in 30 years.

430
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:16,713
-所以我没被炒鱿鱼吗 -炒鱿鱼
Does this mean I'm not fired. Kathleen: Fired?

431
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:19,466
天 你这是在给我黄金
My God. What you're giving me is gold.

432
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:21,051
这是燃料
It's fuel.

433
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:25,639
我就靠这个活着 我会利用它
I live off it. I use it.

434
00:22:27,016 --> 00:22:29,017
你摘掉了耳塞是你走运
And you're lucky you took those earbuds out

435
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,855
因为你马上要听到这辈子的最佳演出了
because you're about to hear the performance of a lifetime.

436
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,526
我喜欢你的作品
I love your work.

437
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:43,282
你在凯瑟琳·汤森的
You survived a face full

438
00:22:43,324 --> 00:22:44,825
当面臭骂之后活下来了 小姑娘
of Kathleen Townsend, kid.

439
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:48,787
感觉你挺正常的 菲尔
Uh, I mean, you seem like a normal guy, Phil.

440
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,789
你怎么忍受这些剧院人的
How are you putting up with these theater people?

441
00:22:50,832 --> 00:22:54,626
你得爱他们 得理解他们
Well, you got to love em, and you got to understand'em.

442
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:57,629
凯瑟琳说的 也没说错
I mean, what Kathleen said, she's right.

443
00:22:57,672 --> 00:23:00,757
舞台上的演出就类似魔法
What happens on that stage is a kind of magic.

444
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,801
我能见证那些人第一次
And I get to see someone hit with it,

445
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:06,430
被那些戏所触动 所改变的样子
truly transformed by it for the first time every show.

446
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:08,599
所以我才坚持在做这一行
That's probably why I keep doing it.

447
00:23:08,641 --> 00:23:11,059
那你人比我好 菲尔
Well, you're a better man than me, Phil.

448
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:14,980
我都是真心话 不过
Well, everything I said and, but also,

449
00:23:15,064 --> 00:23:16,148
杰克·丹尼威士忌
Jack Daniels

450
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:19,359
是我的戏剧顾问
is my dramaturg.

451
00:23:19,402 --> 00:23:23,614
这才是能支撑我继续工作的加油鼓劲
Now you see, this is the kind of pep talk I can get behind.

452
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:25,824
就一晚上 小姑娘
One night only, kid.

453
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:27,910
等首演完 这就都结束了
After opening, this is all over.

454
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:32,206
敬首演
To opening night.

455
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:41,006
不好意思 亲爱的
Ava : Excuse me, darling.

456
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:43,008
你能不能把我灌醉
Can you get me absolutely shit- faced?

457
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:45,511
我会保证你永远有酒喝的
Oh, you'll never see the bottom of that glass.

458
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:46,929
你是说像你一样吗
Michael: You mean like you?

459
00:23:49,474 --> 00:23:53,185
夏天 感觉就像冬天
Summer felt like winter

460
00:23:53,228 --> 00:23:54,353
感觉就像春天
felt like spring

461
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:55,938
我甚至想念嘻哈本·富兰克林了
Makes you miss the hip- hop Ben Franklin.

462
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,940
我不知道那些季节是什么样的感觉
I didn't know what the seasons felt like- -

463
00:23:57,982 --> 00:24:00,734
老掉牙的过气女星
Michael: ...you washed- up has- been.

464
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:02,861
你这可悲的挑剔混蛋
Kathleen: You pathetic, preening prick!

465
00:24:02,904 --> 00:24:04,363
你们听得开心就好
Glad someone's riveted.

466
00:24:04,405 --> 00:24:06,073
你觉得你是个女演员吗 你就是个笑话
Michael: ...actress. You're a joke.

467
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:07,699
凯瑟琳和迈克在后台吵架
Kathleen and Michael are fighting backstage,

468
00:24:07,742 --> 00:24:09,076
他们忘记关麦了
and they forgot to turn off their mics.

469
00:24:09,118 --> 00:24:10,369
失败作品
Kathleen: ...failure.

470
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:12,246
整个剧组以前都在笑你
Michael: The whole crew used to laugh at you.

471
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,873
-真是不开玩笑 -还女演员呢 就一破烂货
- You weren't kidding. - Michael: Actress? More like hacktress.

472
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:17,709
等下 要是这我们能听到
Hold on, if we can hear this,

473
00:24:17,752 --> 00:24:19,878
你知道还有谁能听到吗
you realize who else can hear it, right?

474
00:24:21,256 --> 00:24:25,175
我总是问 自己为什么 上帝 为什么
Rebecca: And I always ask myself, why, God, why?

475
00:24:25,218 --> 00:24:28,178
-但鲍比总是能让我觉得 -老太婆
- But Bobby always made me feel Michael: Prune!

476
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:31,473
不如你的鸡巴那么皱巴巴
Kathleen: Not as shriveled as your tiny little dick!

477
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:33,100
混蛋
Asshole!

478
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:35,394
你这狂妄 背后捅刀的贱人
Michael: You vain, backstabbing hag.

479
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:38,230
谁在说话啊 是幽灵吗
Who's talking? Is that the ghost?

480
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:40,190
这是我唯一的愿望
That's all I've ever wanted.

481
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:49,908
感觉风暴快要来了
Oh. Feels like a storm is brewin'.

482
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:54,121
我今天在超市看到克劳福德家的小伙子了
I saw the Crawford boy down the supermarket today.

483
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:55,205
他问起你了
He asked about you.

484
00:24:55,248 --> 00:24:56,999
-谢了 -别说了 妈
Thanks. - Rebecca: Oh, stop it, Mama!

485
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,294
别以为还会有男人要我
Stop thinking that any man would ever want me.

486
00:25:00,295 --> 00:25:02,254
杀了我吧
Kill me.

487
00:25:02,297 --> 00:25:04,965
人总说彭萨科拉有两种人
Michael: There are two kinds of men in Pensacola- -

488
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:08,886
飞行员 和让他们能上天的人
pilots, and the men who keep 'em up in the air.

489
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:11,221
如果你忘了 他们会提醒你
And if you forget, they'll remind you.

490
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:12,306
你看凯瑟琳
Watch Kathleen.

491
00:25:12,348 --> 00:25:13,474
有些人说这就是为什么
Michael: Some folks say that's why-

492
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:14,892
她好入戏
She's so present.

493
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:17,144
看看她
Look at her.

494
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:20,105
她眼里的恐惧和期待
Fear and anticipation in her eyes.

495
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:22,858
你说的对
Yeah, you're right.

496
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:24,776
这是我第一次真的信她
This is the first time I've really believed her.

497
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,906
小\l

艾娃 艾娃
Michael: Ava! Ava!

502
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:47,174
我的天
Audience Member Oh, my God!

503
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:54,640
听着 这不是你的错
Charlie: I mean, look, it's not your fault.

504
00:25:54,682 --> 00:25:57,476
有个女人在我的舞台上摔死了
A woman fell to her death on my stage.

505
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:58,644
这怎么不是我的错了
How is it not my fault?

506
00:25:58,686 --> 00:26:01,021
因为那只是个意外 好吗
Because it was a crazy acciclent, okay?

507
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:02,981
你想想 有多少地方
I mean, just think about all the things

508
00:26:03,024 --> 00:26:04,900
出问题了
that had to go wrong.

509
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:07,611
大灯掉下来了 迈克心脏病发
The light fell. Michael had a heart attack.

510
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:09,488
他老婆在喝了我给她倒的好东西之后
His wife ran up with his pills

511
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:13,158
带着他的药冲上舞台
after I poured her a bottle of the good stuff, by the way.

512
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:15,994
要是这些事里缺了任何一环
If any one of those things hadn't happened,

513
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:17,788
我们现在就已经在垃圾桶旁边
you and me will be outside by the dumpsters

514
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:20,374
给克里斯托弗·诺兰的电影打分排名了
ranking Christopher Nolan movies right now.

515
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,626
不 只要幕布拉开
No, as soon as the curtain goes up

516
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:24,461
那就都是我的责任
it's all my responsibility.

517
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:27,798
看来我是走运
I guess I'm lucky.

518
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:29,508
警察只要查查我的保温杯
All the cops had to do is check my thermos,

519
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:31,260
我就要去坐牢了
and I'd be sitting in a cell.

520
00:26:33,012 --> 00:26:35,639
拜托 我了解你
Come on. I know you.

521
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:37,641
你只是需要一些爱尔兰咖啡鸡尾酒
It was just a little Irish coffee

522
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:38,934
来放松 对吧
to take the edge off, right?

523
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,394
是 我也是这样以为的
Yeah, that's what I thought.

524
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:43,063
可能是我酒量不行了
Maybe I'm a lightweight now.

525
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:46,817
我肯定是检查过活栓和垫子的
I know I checked that bolt and those pads.

526
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,236
这是我记忆里最后一件事在我
It's the last thing I remember before...

527
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:53,657
我的天
Oh God.

528
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,826
我的天
Oh God.

529
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:59,121
我的天
Oh, my God.

530
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:02,249
我的天
Oh, my God.

531
00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:07,337
老天 你这是能随便放的吗
Jesus. Should you be leaving those out?

532
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,214
宝贝 我是个女演员
Baby, I'm an actress.

533
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:12,050
要是我的化妆间没有安必恩
If I didn't have a bottle of Ambien in my dressing room,

534
00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:13,969
别人才会好奇呢
people would ask questions.

535
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:15,429
是啊 我们真是对不起菲尔
Yeah, it's too bad about Phil.

536
00:27:15,472 --> 00:27:18,348
他又不是坐牢了
It's not like he's in jail or anything.

537
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:21,351
他只是出了点小问题而已
He just went a little overboard.

538
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:24,271
你是真想念当年自己扮演祸水红颜的时候啊
Wow. You really missed your window for playing a femme fatale.

539
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:26,857
我可以让全世界回想起来
Now, I can remind the whole world

540
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,568

553
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:02,476
说好的我们去海外躲一年
What happened to we hide out overseas for a year

554
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,145
然后再回来承认关系呢
and then reemerge confessing our love.

555
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:06,730
那是你写的剧本啊 宝贝
You wrote the script, baby.

556
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:08,315
我知道 是我写的

557
00:28:08,358 --> 00:28:09,733
-现在我要改剧市了 -不
- And now I'm flipping it. - No.

558
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:11,819
我要彻底改掉剧本
I'm flipping the script entirely.

559
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:16,824
没错 是你的悲剧让我们走到了一起
Yes. Your tragedy is what drew us together.

560
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:18,408
这风险太大了
It's risky.

561
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,577
宝贝
Oh, baby

562
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,540
你不想现在就跟我在一起吗
don't you want to be together right now?

563
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:29,211
你不觉得我们应该开始花一花那些
Don't you think we should start spending

564
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:31,797
她之交易的钱呢
some of that She Trade money.

565
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,966
好
Oh yes.

566
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:39,179
聚光灯是属于我们的 宝贝
The spotlight's ours, baby.

567
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:41,557
不要错过它的热量
Let's get it while it's hot.

568
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:54,820
让我弄清楚
So let me get this straight,

569
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:57,865
有个女人死在了我们面前
a woman dies right in our faces

570
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,992
他们却不给我们找心理咨询
and instead of giving us grief counseling,

571
00:29:00,034 --> 00:29:01,785
反而要我们工作
we have to work.

572
00:29:01,828 --> 00:29:03,620
剧院人就是这么坚强
Theater people are so strong.

573
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:06,874
我不知道 但这 这说不通啊
I don't know, it just, it, it doesn't make any sense.

574
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,751
那兄弟都心脏病发了
I mean, the dude had a coronary,

575
00:29:09,794 --> 00:29:11,420
还死了老婆
and then his wife died.

576
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:14,715
哪个医生会同意啊
Like, what doctor signed off on this?

577
00:29:14,757 --> 00:29:16,383
帮埃德治安官找个位子
Find a seat for Sheriff Ed.

578
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:19,261
他是《幽灵与警察》的狂热粉丝
He's some crazy"Spooky and the Cop"fan.

579
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:21,305
我们满座了 如果他没有票
It's a sellout. If he doesn't have a ticket...

580
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:22,890
他要座位你就给
Give the lawman what he wants.

581
00:29:22,932 --> 00:29:25,184
他刚刚处理了全康涅狄格州
He just dealt with the richest woman in Connecticut

582
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:27,311
最富有的女人被醉鬼舞台监督害死的案子
getting killed by a drunk stagehand.

583
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:28,979
拜托 扯淡
Oh, come on. Bullshit.

584
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:30,355
注意你的言行
Thin ice.

585
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:32,774
赶紧出去把你的工作做好
Get out there and keep your job

586
00:29:42,535 --> 00:29:43,744
你要干什么
What do you want?

587
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:45,370
不用担心福斯
Oh, don't worry about Fosse.

588
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:47,706
他今天很乖
He's very well- behaved today.

589
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:53,754
我之前就觉得很奇怪
So I thought it was weird

590
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:56,215
迈克怎么会在复习台词
that Michael was going over his dialogue for the show

591
00:29:56,216 --> 00:29:59,009
毕竟他彩排就一句都没错过
since he didn't miss a single line in rehearsal.

592
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:03,013
所以我就看了他的大衣口袋 真想不到
So I checked in his coat pocket and lo and behold,

593
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:07,017
这不是《彭萨科拉的幽灵》的台词
this is not dialogue from"Ghosts of Pensacola. "

594
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,728
是你们俩在我独白的时候
This is the fight that the two of you had

595
00:30:09,771 --> 00:30:12,064
吵架的台词
during my monologue.

596
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:15,567
你们用来掩饰谋杀艾娃的那一架
The fight that you used to cover up Ava's murder.

597
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,196
亲爱的 我和迈克是在
Sweetheart, Michael and I are workshopping

598
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:22,574
排练一位优秀新作家的戏
a new play by a brilliant new writer,

599
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:24,868
我们是在后台对台词
and we're running lines backstage.

600
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:27,621
要是我看到你们俩在后台在一起
That might fly if I had seen

601
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:29,456
这可能还说得通
the two of you backstage together.

602
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:31,583
但我没有 你们都不在
But I didn't. You were gone.

603
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:34,044
我的独白刚好给你们足够时间
And my monologue gave you just enough time

604
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:35,671
来破坏大灯和活板门
to sabotage the light and the trapdoor

605
00:30:35,755 --> 00:30:37,339
所以就是你们干的
So you did it.

606
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:39,508
你看太多犯罪纪录片了
You watch too much"Dateline"

607
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,301
不 但我看了很多
Rebecca: No, but I have been watching

608
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:43,220
《幽灵与警察》
a heck of a lot of"Spooky and the Cop. "

609
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:45,347
这一出戏正好就是
And this exact thing happens

610
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,518
第6季第11集的《离开舞台之死》
in season six, episode 11, "Exit Stage Death. "

611
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:52,855
你们两个懒货连台词都没改
You lazy assholes didn't even bother to change the dialogue.

612
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:58,110
所以 这是我要的价格
So, um...here's my price.

613
00:30:58,153 --> 00:31:01,405
这是我的银行账户信息
And here is my bank info.

614
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:07,578
所以如果今晚这出戏演完
So if that money is not in my account

615
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,746
钱还没到我账上
by the end of the play tonight,

616
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:12,249
我就要去报警了
I'm going to the police.

617
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:17,379
对哦 还有一件事
Oh, and one last thing.

618
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:19,506
那段独白我演得无可挑剔
I killed that fucking monologue, okay?

619
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,384
所以你别想再抢我风头
So don't you ever upstage me again.

620
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,595
傻逼老头老太
Fucking boomers.

621
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:30,184
行 所以我们该怎么办
Okay, what are we going to do?

622
00:31:31,102 --> 00:31:34,396
我们得付钱 没得选了
We have to pay. We have no choice.

623
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:49,119
我来送道具食物的
Just delivering the prop food.

624
00:31:49,162 --> 00:31:50,871
我是这里的
Oh, I belong here.

625
00:31:50,955 --> 00:31:52,706
对 来送道具食物的
Yeah. Okay, sir, prop food.

626
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:54,124
老天
Jesus.

627
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:55,834
还有10分钟开幕
Man: Ten minutes to curtain.

628
00:31:55,877 --> 00:31:57,461
10分钟后开幕
Ten minutes to curtain.

629
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,298
菲尔的开演前检查清单
Phil's preshow checklist.

630
00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:02,925
靠 我得去过一遍检查清单
Oh shit. I got to do the checklist.

631
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,384
哇哦
Charlie: Wow.

632
00:32:04,385 --> 00:32:06,804
开演前他勾了活板门这一项的
He ticked off the flappy door checkbox before the show.

633
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:08,180
-这儿写着呢 -所以呢
It's here. - Harry: So?

634
00:32:08,223 --> 00:32:10,557
如果他拴上了门
If he secured the flappy door,

635
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,559
那就代表是有人又打开了门闩
that means that someone unsecured it.

636
00:32:12,602 --> 00:32:13,936
也就是说那不是菲尔的错
That means it wasn't Phil's fault

637
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:15,103
更不是什么意外了
and it wasn't an accident.

638
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:17,481
除了凯瑟琳
Is anyone else besides Kathleen

639
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:19,525
还有谁要用活板门下台吗
supposed to go through that flappy door?

640
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:22,361
她的活板门高光诶 你开什么玩笑
Her big trapdoor moment? Are you kidding me?

641
00:32:23,446 --> 00:32:25,906
也就是说目标是凯瑟琳
That means that Kathleen was the target.

642
00:32:25,949 --> 00:32:27,157
我得给菲尔发个短信
I gotta text Phil.

643
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,534
我的天
Oh, my God.

644
00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:30,244
-喂 -我是查莉
Hey. It's Charlie.

645
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:31,829
那不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

646
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:34,790
是有人故意破坏 破 毁
It was sabotage. S- A- B- O- O...

647
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,500
-好像不太对 -演出马上就要开始了
That doesn't seem right. - The show is about to start

648
00:32:36,543 --> 00:32:38,210
我的天 兄弟 我们刚想清楚
Oh, my God, dude, dude, we just figured out

649
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:39,795
有人想杀凯瑟琳
that someone is trying to kill Kathleen.

650
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:42,005
你现在要再给他们一次动手机会吗
Now you're going to give them another whack at the pinata.

651
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:43,715
但演出马上就要开始了
But the show is about to start!

652
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:48,720
这不是我的刀子嘴批评家吗
Oh, if it isn't my fiercest critic.

653
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:52,349
你是准备在我上台之前给我点建议吗
Are you here to give me some notes before my swan song?

654
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:54,351
那不是菲尔的错
Charlie: It wasn't Phil's fault.

655
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:55,519
他被人陷害了
He was framed.

656
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:58,689
我觉得是有人给他下了药
So I think someone drugged him

657
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:00,524
在活板门上动了手脚
and futzed with the floor door.

658
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,401
我不知道为什么
I mean, I don't know why,

659
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:03,986
但我觉得凶手的目标是你
but I think you were the target.

660
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:08,407
会站上活板门的只有你 所以
You're the only one who was supposed to stand on it, so...

661
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,410
我在那上面走了好多次
I walk across it many times

662
00:33:11,452 --> 00:33:13,162
都没掉下去
and did not fall through.

663
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:15,706
那应该是够结实的
My blocking is very vigorous.

664
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,292
-好吧 -听着
Okay, uh - Look,

665
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:20,794
剧院里是经常出事的
things happen in the theater all the time.

666
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:22,546
整个布景都可能垮掉
Entire sets collapse.

667
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:24,756
通电的线就这么露在外面
Live wires get exposed,

668
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,967
电倒演员
they electrocute actors.

669
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,677
但我们依然在坚持
But we persevere.

670
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,180
抱歉 我觉得你没听懂我的意思
Hey, I- I'm so sorry. I don't think you're hearing me.

671
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:32,890
这是有人想杀你
Someone's trying to kill you.

672
00:33:32,932 --> 00:33:35,434
我不会再让你出去的
I'm not going to let you go back out there.

673
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:41,899
我的麦已经开了
I'm already on.

674
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:44,610
赶紧出去吧
Now get out of my room.

675
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:46,445
服装师
Wardrobe.

676
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:03,921
雄猫战斗机吗
Tomcat?

677
00:34:04,005 --> 00:34:06,465
不 那是幻影
No, that's a Phantom.

678
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:09,426
真不知道他们何必费这么大力气
I don't know why they bother.

679
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:11,929
他们说士兵们圣诞节前就能回家了
They say our boys will be home by Christmas.

680
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:13,180
叫38
: Cue 38.

681
00:34:13,223 --> 00:34:15,057
听着 那是菲尔吗
: Listen, is that Phil?

682
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:16,391
给我
Give me that.

683
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:17,768
-菲尔 菲尔 -嗨
- Phil, Phil. - Phil: Hey.

684
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:19,812
听着 我不明白
Listen, I, I, I don't get it.

685
00:34:19,896 --> 00:34:21,730
那个栓在艾娃走上去之前
I mean, the bolt must have been in place

686
00:34:21,815 --> 00:34:23,899
一定是在那里的
until Ava walked across it.

687
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,567
你还见过有谁在舞台下面吗
Did you see anybody else down there?

688
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,527
没有
Phil: Nobody.

689
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:27,778
听着 查莉 我很感谢
Look, Charlie, I appreciate

690
00:34:27,821 --> 00:34:29,822
你想帮 我但你别管了
what you're trying to do, but just let it go.

691
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:31,031
我不能不管 菲尔
Charlie: No can do, Phil.

692
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:32,699
我就跟《盗火线》最后的德尼罗一样
I'm like De Niro at the end of"Heat, "man.

693
00:34:32,742 --> 00:34:34,284
所以别放弃
So stay tuned.

694
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:38,205
我需要看一下昨晚演出的视频
I need to see the video of last night's show.

695
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:41,208
你请便 接过这个诅咒
Well, be my guest. Take the curse off me.

696
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:42,835
这就跟《午夜凶铃》里的录像带一样
It's like the video from"The Ring, "

697
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:44,378
但现在菲尔不在了 轮到我当舞台监督了
but with Phil gone, I'm the stage manager

698
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,421
我能参考的只有这段视频
and I have nothing to go on except this video

699
00:34:46,506 --> 00:34:48,090
和菲尔昨晚的笔记
and Phil's notes from last night.

700
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:52,719
等等等等
Charlie: Hey, hey, hey.

701
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:53,929
那是什么
What is that?

702
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,806
那是演吗
Is that smoke?

703
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:57,391
看上去像是干冰
Harry: Looks like dry ice.

704
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:01,270
你们把干冰都放哪儿
Where do you keep this, uh, dry ice?

705
00:35:10,446 --> 00:35:11,738
你没事吧
Man: You okay?

706
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:15,284
天 我得去找凯瑟林
Jesus. I- I got to talk to Kathleen.

707
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:17,911
等等 别
Hey, wait. Stop!

708
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:20,914
你看到这个没有 这是舞台界限
See that? It's a sight line.

709
00:35:20,957 --> 00:35:23,750
你不能过去 过去就上台了
You can't cross it, you're in the play.

710
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:27,045
鲍比是我未曾想到的礼物
Kathleen: Bobby was my unexpected gift.

711
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,465
虽然很可耻
Shameful as it was,

712
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,968
但我依然爱他
I loved him so.

713
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:36,430
他爱那些流星
He liked the stars that moved fast,

714
00:35:36,473 --> 00:35:38,140
就像他的飞机一样
like his aircraft.

715
00:35:38,183 --> 00:35:39,808
我弄清楚了
Charlie: Hey, I figured it out.

716
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:41,268
栓子是干冰
The bolt was dry ice.

717
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:43,187
让我说完 也就是说肯定有人
Excuse me. That means that someone definitely- -

718
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:45,606
蟋蟀真是活跃
The crickets are certainly very active.

719
00:35:45,648 --> 00:35:47,608
快下来 下台
...off! Off the stage.

720
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,485
这些蟋蟀真是疯了
Oh, these crickets are wild.

721
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:50,444
下台
Off the stage.

722
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:51,904
这些蟋蟀得闭嘴
They need to stop, the crickets.

723
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:52,821
下台
Charlie: Get off the stage.

724
00:35:52,906 --> 00:35:53,780
你得闭嘴
You need to stop now.

725
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,449
你得下台
You need to get off the stage.

726
00:35:55,492 --> 00:35:57,034
-贾瑞特 -老天
Um, GarrettJesus!

727
00:35:57,076 --> 00:36:00,204
你怎么在屋里抽那脏东西
...what are you doing smoking that filthy thing in the house.

728
00:36:00,246 --> 00:36:03,207
要是不小心 黛西会得胸膜炎的
You'll give Daisy pleurisy if you don't watch out.

729
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:04,625
妈 我也抽烟的
Mother, I smoke.

730
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:06,126
你很惊讶吗
Does that shock you?

731
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:09,171
没错 我会抽烟
That's right. I smoke cigarettes.

732
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:11,381
你的女儿 你的小女儿
Your daughter, your little girl.

733
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:13,300
-谢天谢地 -它很适合我 能让我的灵魂安稳下来
- Thank God. Rebecca: It suits me. It calms my spirit

734
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:15,344
-嗨 -让我的大脑放松
- Hey! ...and it eases my mind.

735
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:17,805
好吧 看来她
Uh, yeah, well, looks like we got us

736
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:20,307
真是个烟民 萨凡纳
a real smoker, Savannah.

737
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,058
挺好的 黛西
Good for you, Daisy.

738
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,768
你干什么呢
Hey, what are you doing?

739
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:25,020
我自己就很享受
I myself enjoy smoking

740
00:36:25,104 --> 00:36:26,605
在窗边抽烟
by the window over here.

741
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:29,817
放开我 放开我
Let me go. Let me go!

742
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,110
我们都会死于烟
Smoke is going to be the death of all of us.

743
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:34,947
我知道了
I know what let's do

744
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:37,407
我们一起烤点什么吧
let's bake something together

745
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,784
佛岛酸橙派吧
A key lime pie.

746
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:40,327
就像你小时候一样
Like when you were a little girl.

747
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,621
我已经不是小姑娘了妈妈
I'm not a little girl anymore, Mama.

748
00:36:42,705 --> 00:36:43,831
是迈克
Charlie: It was Michael!

749
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:46,416
他手上有冻伤 因为他用干冰
His fingers are burned from the dry ice

750
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:48,085
做了手脚
he used to rig the floor.

751
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:50,504
这里面应该是有牛奶的
There's supposed to be milk in here somewhere.

752
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:52,005
在这儿呢
Oh, there.

753
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:55,134
迈克全程一直都在舞台上
Michael was on stage the entire time.

754
00:36:55,176 --> 00:36:57,845
不 畸形足小姐的独白 有整整三分钟呢
No, the chubby foot monologue, that was three minutes.

755
00:36:57,887 --> 00:37:00,180
-他可以 -我们吵架的时候
He could have- - Our argument.

756
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:02,349
大家都听到了 你也听到了
Everyone heard it. You heard it.

757
00:37:02,392 --> 00:37:04,935
你他妈到底在说什么
Now, what the fuck are you even talking about?

758
00:37:04,978 --> 00:37:07,187
你差点就要死了 女士
You almost caught the bus, lady.

759
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,231
那个掉下来的大灯救了你一命
That falling light saved your life.

760
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:12,109
如果我是冰箱 你会关注我吗
...if I were a refrigerator, would you pay attention to me?

761
00:37:12,152 --> 00:37:15,279
没错 你觉得他对灯动手脚是为了自杀吗
Exactly. And do you think he rigged the light to kill himself?

762
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:16,530
大灯
The light?

763
00:37:16,573 --> 00:37:19,199
像他老爹一样
Michael: ...watching life like his old man!

764
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:21,994
我为什么要逼鲍比 为什么
Why did I push Bobby? Why?

765
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:25,455
你只让他要志向高远
You only told him to aim high.

766
00:37:25,498 --> 00:37:28,709
我们对孩子不都是这么期望的吗
Isn't that what we all want for our children?

767
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,880
但当我看到他穿着那身蓝色制服的时候
But when I saw him in those dress blues.

768
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:37,009
他天生就是要飞翔的
Kathleen: Oh, that boy was born to fly.

769
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:39,511
我们的儿子 他快乐吗
Was he happy, our son?

770
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:41,138
他快乐吗
Was he happy?

771
00:37:41,181 --> 00:37:44,057
宝贝 你我都清楚
Kathleen: Oh, baby, you and I both know that

772
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,726
鲍比最开心的时候
Bobby was never happy

773
00:37:45,768 --> 00:37:49,396
就是在天上与鸟儿肩并肩的时候
other than when he was up there flying with the birds.

774
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:53,275
如果这有意义的话 如果有任何意义的话
If that matters. If anything matters.

775
00:37:54,486 --> 00:37:55,611
我爱你
I love you.

776
00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:58,697
这就是最重要的
That matters.

777
00:37:59,616 --> 00:38:00,574
这是真话
The truth.

778
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:03,118
我也爱你
I love you, too.

779
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,467
嗨 嗨 畸形足小姐
Hey, hey, chubby foot.

780
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,594
我们碰到了点问题
Uh, we've got a situation here.

781
00:38:20,637 --> 00:38:22,930
你是谁啊 你是刚从灯架上下来吗
Who are you? Did you just come down from the lights?

782
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:24,181
这不重要 我之前以为
It doesn't matter. So I thought

783
00:38:24,265 --> 00:38:25,974
迈克是想杀凯瑟琳
that Michael was trying to kill Kathleen,

784
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:27,267
但我弄错了
but I was wrong.

785
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,437
他是想杀他老婆 他们是一伙的
It was his wife, and they were in it together.

786
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,231
迈克和凯瑟琳
Michael and Kathleen.

787
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:34,441
他们不是互相仇恨的
You see, they don't hate each other.

788
00:38:34,526 --> 00:38:36,026
-他们是相爱的 -你跟我说这个干什么
They love each other. - Why are you telling me this?

789
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:38,111
-我要上台了 -因为
- I'm about to go on. Oh, because...

790
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:39,696
不好意思 你可以证明这件事
Excuse me. You can prove it.

791
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:43,951
那是在你在台上独白的时候
You see, it was during your foot club speech thing.

792
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:46,036
他在对活板门动手脚
He was futzing with the flappy door,

793
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,081
而她在乱搞大灯
and she, she was messing with the light.

794
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:50,791
你那有多长 3分钟是吧
What was it? Three minutes, right?

795
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:54,211
对 但我看到他们俩一起在后台了
Yes. But I saw the two of them backstage together,

796
00:38:54,295 --> 00:38:55,838
所以那不可能是他们干的 好吗
so they couldn't possibly have done it, okay.

797
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,465
你能别烦我了吗 我要上台了
So...will you leave me alone. I have to go on.

798
00:38:58,508 --> 00:38:59,716
等等 你为什么要说谎
Wait, why are you lying?

799
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:01,135
难道你也爱他吗
Wait, are you in love with him too?

800
00:39:01,136 --> 00:39:03,220
你能不能别烦我
Will you please leave me alone?

801
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:04,930
你们是三人行吗
Are you a thruple?

802
00:39:04,973 --> 00:39:06,765
-靠 -妈妈
Shit. Rebecca: Mama.

803
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:09,852
你觉得比利·克劳福德会来电话吗
Do you think Billy Crawford will come calling?

804
00:39:09,936 --> 00:39:13,564
我可以打电话问问他妈妈吧
Oh, I could call his mother and ask her, couldn't I?

805
00:39:18,945 --> 00:39:22,030
算了 妈妈 当我没提
No, never mind, Mama. Forget I mentioned it.

806
00:39:22,115 --> 00:39:23,282
我会的
Kathleen: I will.

807
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:27,494
你觉得会不会有什么迹象
Do you think there could be a sign or somethin'?

808
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:40,549
这群演员 我靠
Fucking actors, man.

809
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:46,346
畸形足 够硬核
Chubby foot. Very hardcore.

810

闭嘴 闭嘴
Quiet, quiet, heyl

811

816
00:40:11,581 --> 00:40:12,581

Charlie: Oh, Jesus.

817
00:40:12,665 --> 00:40:14,416
-谢了 妈妈 -靠
Thank you, Mama. Charlie: Oh shit.

818
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:18,337

819
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:20,380
-混合饼干是谁吃的 -瑞贝卡
Which actor eats the Chex Mix? - Rebecca.

820
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:22,758

No, they put peanut butter in it. They're gonna kill again.

821
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:24,384
靠
Shit.

822
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:26,094
我当时还好年轻
Michael: I was so young.

823
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:28,305
弗罗里达州立大学在找后卫
Florida State was looking for a fullback.

824
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:29,765
教练看上了我
Coach was scouting me,

825
00:40:29,766 --> 00:40:32,059
你觉得我想18岁就结婚吗
You think I wanted to get married at 18?

826
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:33,936
你觉得我想吗
Kathleen: Do you think I did?

827
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:10,681
我 我是彭萨科拉的幽灵
I am, I am a ghost of Pensacola.

828
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:14,268
你不是来吃东西的
Uh, and you are not here to eat.

829
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,355
你要和大家聊聊你的畸形足
You are here to talk about your chubby foot

830
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:21,275

不要让你母亲
Do not let your mother

832
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:27,489
毒害了你的灵魂
poison your spirit

833
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:33,120
不要让她逼疯你
and drive you nuts.

834
00:41:33,163 --> 00:41:36,331
现在 我要回到
And now I will return

835
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:40,043
彭萨科拉的灵界
to the spirit realm of Pensacola.

836
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:42,379
Okay. 好

837
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:44,298
拜拜
: Goodbye!

838
00:41:46,676 --> 00:41:48,302
搞什么 你看我干什么
What, why are you looking at me?

839
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:50,387
-我做了什么 -我说什么了吗 -听着 瑞贝卡
What'd I do? What'd I say? - Listen, Rebec- -

840
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,556
黛西 听着 黛西
I mean, Daisy. Listen, Daisy.

841
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:53,849
你妈这跟我都没关系
I had nothing to do with your mom- -

842
00:41:53,892 --> 00:41:55,267
-妈 -怎么了
Mama. Kathleen: What?

843
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,687
爸 你们已经失去了一个孩子
Daddy. You already lost one child,

844
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,064
差点失去另一个
and you almost lost another one.

845
00:42:02,192 --> 00:42:05,319
所以现在 我的爱的代价
So now, the price of my love

846
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:07,154
翻倍了
has doubled,

847
00:42:07,197 --> 00:42:10,073
我要求立刻看到它
and I demand to see it immediately.

848
00:42:11,784 --> 00:42:13,660
开什么玩笑 就现在
Are you fucking kidding me? Immediately!

849
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:24,171
夏天 感觉就像冬天
Summer felt like winter.

850
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:27,424
你怎么能不跟我说 就这么动手了呢
How could you do that without talking to me first?

851
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:29,635
什么 哦对
What? Oh, yes.

852
00:42:32,972 --> 00:42:34,681
你想什么呢
What were you thinking?

853
00:42:34,766 --> 00:42:37,184
总得有人动手
Someone had to do it.

854
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:39,186
你疯了
Michael: You're insane.

855
00:42:39,229 --> 00:42:41,855
我们可以付钱给她的 这样都结束了
We could have paid her off. This would all be over.

856
00:42:41,898 --> 00:42:43,816
你别太天真了
Oh, don't be so naive.

857
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:46,068
她完全可能继续回来要钱
She would have just come back for more.

858
00:42:48,071 --> 00:42:51,698
治安官 没私下见过你最爱的两位演员吧
Hey, Sheriff. Never meet your heroes, right?

859
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:56,662
你花了那么多年策划杀掉自己的老婆
Kathleen: You spend years planning your wife's murder

860
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:59,498
结果被一个该死的临时演员敲诈
to get shafted by a fucking day player.

861
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:01,458
有必要的话我塞也要
I will shove that peanut butter

862
00:43:01,501 --> 00:43:05,254
把花生酱塞进那小婊子的喉咙里
down that Juilliard bitch's throat if I have to.

863
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:07,714
不 听着 到此为止了
No. Okay, look, that's it.

864
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:09,675
我们要给她付钱
We're going to pay her off, alright.

865
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:11,218
我去联系我的经理
I'm going to call my business manager.

866
00:43:11,261 --> 00:43:13,387
他肯定会暴怒的
He is going to have a fit.

867
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:16,390
迈克 这他妈是什么
Kathleen: Michael, what the fuck is that?

868
00:43:16,432 --> 00:43:17,766
什么啊
Michael: What?

869
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:20,477
搞什么
What in the hell?

870
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:26,150
靠
Oh...shit.

871
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:34,575
我们完蛋了
We're fucked.

872
00:43:34,576 --> 00:43:36,535
他们都听到了
They heard everything.

873
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:39,788
我现在该怎么办
What do I do now?

874
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:44,835
利用它
We use it.

875
00:43:46,212 --> 00:43:47,754
该上场了 宝贝
Showtime, baby.

876
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:54,595
我以前每年都会等着那次游行
I used to wait for that parade every year.

877
00:43:55,305 --> 00:43:57,014
独立日
Independence Day.

878
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:01,185
为了谁 为了什么
For who? From what?

879
00:44:01,227 --> 00:44:04,480
鲍比的生父坠落在了日本海
Bobby's real daddy went down over the Sea of Japan.

880
00:44:05,565 --> 00:44:08,192
1952年7月12日
July 12th, 1952.

881
00:44:09,652 --> 00:44:11,236
他是个飞行员
An aviator.

882
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:15,491
你为什么选择了鲍比
Why did you take Bobby?

883
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:18,368
他哪儿都比我强
He was better than me in every way!

884
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:23,665
彭萨科拉的那年冬天很冷
Kathleen: It was cold in Pensacola that winter.

885
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,668
冷得不自然
Unnatural cold.

886
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:29,505
来得太早的霜
Frost that comes too early

887
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:31,965
迟迟不肯离去
means to stay too long,

888
00:44:32,008 --> 00:44:33,467
可能永远不会离去
maybe forever.

889
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,094
雾气升起
The mists rise up.

890
00:44:36,095 --> 00:44:39,681
遮盖住你的脚面 然后到腰
They cover your ankles, then your waist.

891
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:44,561
海洋想要延伸到云端
The sea longs to reach the clouds.

892
00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:49,817
母亲和孩子伸出手寻找彼此
Mother and child reachin' out for each other.

893
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,528
我可爱的鲍比起飞的时候
When my sweet Bobby went up

894
00:44:53,696 --> 00:44:56,365
总是会带着我
he always took me with him.

895
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:58,909
所以那一天
And so it follows that that day,

896
00:45:00,036 --> 00:45:01,662
我也一起坠亡
I, too, went down.

897
00:45:03,414 --> 00:45:05,624
那个寒冷的冬天
That cold winter.

898
00:45:07,335 --> 00:45:09,461
这个冬天
This winter.

899
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:12,214
高至眼睫的雾气
The mists up to the lashline.

900
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,426
羽翼上的冰就是地上的雾气
Ice on the wing is mist on the ground,

901
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:17,761
是眼汨
is tears.

902
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:20,389
雾气升起
The mist rises up,

903
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:22,891
我跪下来迎接它
and I kneel down to meet it.

904
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:29,314
所以现在 我也
And so now I too become

905
00:45:30,275 --> 00:45:31,984
变成了另一个彭萨科拉的
just another ghost.

906
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,199
幽灵
of Pensacola.

907
00:45:43,454 --> 00:45:44,496
好
Man: Bravo!

908
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:46,331
好
Man: Bravo!

909
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:49,626
我只是

00:45:49,669 --> 00:45:53,797
百老汇新人
*A Broadway Baby*

911
00:45:58,303 --> 00:46:02,306
拖着疲惫的步子
*Walking off my tired feet*

912
00:46:05,477 --> 00:46:09,897
走在42街上
*Pounding 42nd Street*

913
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:14,109
为了参演
*To be in a show*

914
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,619
百老汇新人
*Broadway Baby*

915
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:31,835
学习如何唱如何跳

916
00:46:33,546 --> 00:46:38,425
等待着一举成名的机会

917
00:46:38,468 --> 00:46:42,095
参与演出
