00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:48,217
今天的比赛 对于确定今年的新款冠军
where today's race is crucial in determining

5
00:00:48,218 --> 00:00:50,260
至关重要
this year's Late Model champion.

6
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:51,345
至关重要
this year's Late Model champion.

7
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:54,056
冠军将会是莽撞新人 得分领袖
Will it be the brash newcomer and points leader

8
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:56,058
戴维斯·麦克道尔
Davis McDowell?

9
00:00:58,603 --> 00:01:01,480
还是最后一次参赛 目前只落后五分
Or the veteran Keith Owens, in his final season,

10
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:04,233
位居第二的老兵基斯·欧文斯
just five points back in second place?

11
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,863
先前年轻的麦克道尔一直让欧文斯
The youngster McDowell has been giving Owens

12
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:11,240
无法招架
more than he can handle.

13
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:12,908
这两位之间显然是
There is certainly no Iove lost

14
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,369
有一些深仇大恨的
between these two drivers

15
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,329
欧文斯的担子很重 
Owens has got a lot to live up to.

16
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,166
他的父亲和祖父都是赛车传奇
His father and his grandfather were both racing legends.

17
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,252
他现在肩上一定感受到了
He has got to be feeling the weight of that legacy

18
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:25,254
传承的重量
on his shoulders right now.

19
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:28,632
车手们 请发动车辆
Drivers, start your engines.

20
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:33,095
稳扎稳打 搭档
Greg: Smooth and steady, partner,

21
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:34,179
我们都说好了的
just like we talked about.

22
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,223
别操心那小混蛋
Don't worry about that little shit.

23
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:38,642
比好赛就行
Just race your race.

24
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:50,404
女士们先生们

绿色旗子挥起来了

29
00:01:58,997 --> 00:01:59,830
他们出发了
And they re offl

30
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:18,599
欧文斯发现了一个空档 冲向了前方
Owens finds a gap and goes for the front.

31
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:24,938
麦克道尔在内侧紧随其后
McDowell follows on the inside

32
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:35,949
好了 基斯 让这小鬼看看什么才叫老大
Okay, Keith, show that kid who s boss.

33
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,207
欢文斯首先领先
Announcer Owens takes: an early lead

34
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,458
这是你今天最快的一圈

35
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,251
稳住就好

36
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:51,548
白色旗子挥起来了
Announcer The white flag is out.

37
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:52,424
白色旗子挥起来了
Announcer: The white flag is out.

38
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:53,842
最后一圈
It's the final lap.

39
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:57,554
欧文斯领先 但麦克道尔紧追不舍
Owens leads, but McDowell is in hot pursuit.

40
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:12,569
麦克道尔行动了 在去往第三个弯的路上
McDowell makes his move and switches to the outside

41
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,947
转向外道
as they head down turn three.

42
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:19,451
他们进入最后四分之一了
They're heading into the final quarter.

43
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:20,953
他们进入最后四分之一了
Theylre heading into the final quarter.

44
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:23,038
谁赢都有可能
It's anyone's race.

45
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:31,672
天啊 他们相撞了
Oh no, they've hitl

46
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:34,216
麦克道尔撞向了欧文斯的车侧
McDowell with a bump on the back side.

47
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:37,052
欧文斯猛打方向盘试图稳住
Owens in a spin, trying to come out of it.

48
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:39,429
但是他已经回天乏术了
And he's not going to be able to.

49
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:43,642
欧文斯的比赛结束了
Owens'race is over.

50
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:50,524
戴维斯·麦克道尔赢下了比赛
And Davis McDowell will take the checkered flag.

51
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:51,316
戴维斯·麦克道尔赢下了比赛
And Davis McDowell wilj take the checkered flag.

52
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:52,860
-好  -好厉害的冲线
Yes! Announcer What a finish!

53
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:58,991
之后欧文斯想来应当会相当生气
I can imagine Owens will be pretty heated after that move.

54
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:00,284
但是目前
But for the moment,

55
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:02,744
麦克道尔夺得了胜利
it looks like McDowell secures the win

56
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:06,039
继续在锦标赛中保持领先
and extends his lead in the championship

57
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:22,264
麦克道尔就是个莽夫 还是个蠢货
McDowell's a hothead and an idiot.

58
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:24,057
这些小孩 他们今天比赛的方式
These kids, the way they're racing today,

59
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:25,309
在毁掉这项运动
it's ruining the sport.

60
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,477
所以你愿意离开吗
Reporter: So are you happy to be walking away?

61
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:27,603
我是不会离开的
I'm not walking away

62
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:28,645
等等 你不退役吗
Reporter 2: Wait, you're not?

63
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:30,022
因为有流言说你准备退役
Bedause rumors of your retirement-

64
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:32,024
那都是推测
That's all just speculation.

65
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:33,567
我是不会退役的
Im not retiring.

66
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:35,194
欧文斯家的人永不言弃 你们都清楚
Owenses never quit Y all know that

67
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:36,778
-这你知道吗  -不知道
You know about this? Nope

68
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:38,739
-还有什么问题吗  -喂
Any other questions? - Davis: Heyl

69
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:40,574
毁掉这项运动的是你才对 老头子
You're the one ruining the sport, old timer.

70
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,951
你最好赶紧给我们把路让出来
How about you want to get the fuck out of the way? Hmm?

71
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:45,204
被老爹和老爹的老爹压得抬不起头 感觉如何
How's it feel to be the third best Keith in the family?

72
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:47,372
你老爹肯定后悔给你取名也叫基斯了吧
Bet Daddy wishes he named you something else.

73
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:54,004
我不该说他是蠢货
I shouldn't have called him an idiot.

74
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,632
他连蠢货都不如
The kid is worse than an idiot.

75
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:59,301
他身上有种阴暗的东西 让我发抖
There's something dark in there. Gave me the shivers.

76
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:01,678
这搞得像我输不起一样
Just makes me seem like a sore loser.

77
00:05:02,263 --> 00:05:03,514
你被人揍了
You got punched,

78
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:05,224
现在在冰敷脸
and now you're icing your face.

79
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:06,809
你确实是输不起
You are literally a sore loser.

80
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,685
凯蒂 这没必要
Katy, that is not called for.

81
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:12,397
那都是推测 我是不会退役的
That's all just speculation. Im not retiring.

82
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:14,817
欧文斯家的人永不言弃 你们都清楚
Owenses never quit. Y'all know that

83
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:23,534
喂 喂
Hey Heyl

84
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:26,495
你们俩不讲清楚
Neither of you comes in this house

85
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:27,996
都不许进屋
until you work this shit out.

86
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:30,833
我们说好了的
We had an agreement

87
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,168
你说过你这一赛季结束就会退役
You said you were going to retire at the end of the season,

88
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:34,461
然后就轮到我了
and then it's my turn.

89
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:35,462
事情不一样了
Things change.

90
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:37,172
鬼扯 你保证过的
That s bullshit. You promised.

91
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:39,049
如果我能赢下最后一场
If I win this last race,

92
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,759
那就还有机会拿下锦标赛冠军
I can still take the championship.

93
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,636
我知道你急着想出道
I know you're anxious to get out there- -

94
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:44,471
爸 我从出生那天起
Katy: Dad, I have been waiting to do this

95
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:46,390
就在等着出道做赛车手了
since the day I was born.

96
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:49,852
你知道吗 戴维斯没说错
You know, Davis was right.

97
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,062
你需要学会让路
You need to learn to get out of the fuckin"way.

98
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:26,346
你可以事先跟我们说一下的
You could have given us a heads- up.

99
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:27,514
我知道
I know.

100
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:29,683
你跟她保证过的
You promised her.

101
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:32,561
我真的感觉很抱歉
And I feel terrible about that.

102
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:35,397
但欧文斯家的人不能输着退役
But an Owens can't retire a loser.

103
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:37,399
这样对凯蒂也没有好处
How's that gonna help Katy?

104
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,234
别说得你像是为了凯蒂一样
Don't act like this is about Katy

105
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:41,445
我没有手感了 唐娜
I lost my flow, Donna.

106
00:06:43,198 --> 00:06:44,448
赛季中途
Mid- season.

107
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:49,745
我被自己困住了
I can't get out of my own head.

108
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:51,747
我一听到 车手们 请发动车辆
I hear, "Drivers, start your engines, "

109
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:53,999
脑子里就只有 赛道上
and all I can think is there's somebody out there

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,167
有人比我更强
that's better than me.

111
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:57,586
在绿色旗子挥下来之前
I've lost the damn race

112
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:59,963
我就输了比赛了
before they even drop the green flag.

113
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:06,553
嗨各位 我是戴维斯
Davis: Hey, guys, Davis here.

114
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:07,638
我知道比赛结束了
I know the race is over,

115
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,431
但我还有一个地方要去
but I felt like making one last pitstop.

116
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:11,099
-宝贝  -基斯·欧文斯家的前院
Baby...- To Keith Owens' front yard.

117
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,811
帮我个忙 把我的猎枪拿来
Keith: ...do me a favor and go and fetch my shotgun.

118
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:15,813
不用了 女士 我这就走
Hey, no need, ma'am. I'm going.

119
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,488
那是我刚种的
I just planted those motherfuckers.

120
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:34,790
基斯 你他妈别管有没有手感
Keith, you fuck this flow nonsense.

121
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,251
你得给我去赢了那个臭小鬼
You get out there and you beat that evil little shit.

122
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,727
-嗨  -你好
Woman: Hello. Hey there.

123
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:40,355
请问可以派一辆拖车到深泉路
Uh, can I get a tow truck on Deep Springs Road

124
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:41,607
拐弯处吗
by the bend?

125
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,192
你车坏了吗还是怎么的
Woman: You break down or somethin'?

126
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:44,902
对 车发不起来了
Yeah. Car won't start.

127
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:32,968
好 稳扎稳打
Alright. Smooth and steady.

128
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:35,304
不过是练习 不要冒险
Just practice. No need to take chances.

129
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:36,346
明白
Got it.

130
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:06,186
基斯
Man: Keith!

131
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:11,817
-他没事吧  -不不不不
He alright? Greg: No, no, no. No.

132
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:22,744
老天
Charlie: Ah, geez.

133
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:28,625
兰迪 有个小鬼在七号车上
Hey, Randy, so some kid went full Linda Blair

134
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:30,085
吐了一车
on the number seven car.

135
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:32,296
这算什么 我见过吐了一整场的
Shit, that ain't nothin'. I found a whole dook once.

136
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:34,047
那可真是太值得期待了
Oh wow. Something to look forward to.

137
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:37,009
嗨吉恩
Hey Jean,

138
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,261
你得把这挂脖子上吧
you got to wear these around your neck or something

139
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:41,305
我这周都第二次捡到这个了
I mean, this is the second time I found them this week.

140
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:43,474
他们正在向直道过去
Announcer: ...and around as they head down the straightaway.

141
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:45,184
你不想用大屏幕看吗
You don't want to go watch this on the big screen?

142
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:47,186
我知道 我只是紧张
I know. I'm just so nervous.

143
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:49,146
是我儿子在比赛 我看不下去
That's my boy out there. I can't watch.

144
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:51,023
等等 比赛的那是你儿子吗
Wait, that's your kid racing?

145
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:52,065
是啊
Jean: Mm- hmm.

146
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,234
-不开玩笑啊  -玩笑可大了
No shit! Yeah, shit.

147
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,653
麦克道尔先冲过了终点线
Announcer: McDowell crosses the line first

148
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:57,863
赢得了桃树赛道站
and wins the Peach Tree Speedwayl

149
00:12:57,864 --> 00:13:00,657
他赢了
Oh! He did itl Hey!

150
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:03,160
好了 现在我可以看了
Okay. Now I can watch.

151
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:05,329
年轻人的无双胜利
Announcer: An amazing victory for the young

152
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,830
吉恩
Charlie: Jean!

153
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:08,874
戴维斯又赢了 吉恩
Davis did it again, Jean.

154
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:13,253
-他们会采访他吗  -应该会吧
Are they going to interview him? - Yeah, I guess.

155
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:15,422
欧文斯家的人永不言弃 你们都清楚
Owenses never quit. Y'all know that.

156
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:17,925
看来他们要先采访欧文斯
Randy: Looks like they're doing Owens first.

157
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:19,968
为什么要先采访输掉的
Why are they interviewing the loser first?

158
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:21,178
是啊 这样不太好
Yeah, it's kind of messed up.

159
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,139
戴维斯肯定也不开心
I bet Davis is not too happy about that.

160
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,099
你老爹肯定后悔给你取名也叫基斯了吧
Bet Daddy wishes he named you something else.

161
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:28,143
拉开 拉开
Come on! Come on!

162
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:29,686
确实是不开心
Randy: Yep. Not too happy at all.

163
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:31,271
天 这就炸了
Shit. Boom goes the dynamite.

164
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:33,732
是啊 那是你儿子是吧
Yeesh. So that's your kid, huh?

165
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:35,442
真有个拳王样子
Real Manny Pacquiao up there.

166
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:43,534
-别跑  -我没跑
Hey, no running! Boy: I'm notl

167
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:51,458
你能给我签个名吗
Oh, can I have your autograph?

168
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:52,626
当然了
Sure, man.

169
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:55,963
-你们要来点桃子吗  -谢了
Y'all want some peaches? - Thanks.

170
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:59,133
-自己来拿  -这赛季我每场比赛都看了 麦克道尔先生
Help yourselves. I'veseen every race this season, Mr. McDowell.

171
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:00,509
拜托 叫我戴维斯就行
Davis: Come on, now. Y'all call me Davis.

172
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,137
你把基斯·欧文斯赢得落花流水的 还给他脸上来了一拳
You smoked Keith Owens and punched him in the face.

173
00:14:03,138 --> 00:14:04,972
去他妈的 你太厉害了
Fuck that guy, man. It was baller.

174
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,557
没必要 是我没控制住
No need for that now. I lost my cool.

175
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,559
说实话 欧文斯不是坏人
And the truth is, Owens ain t a bad guy.

176
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:10,769
谁想看看我的护身符
Now, who wants to see my lucky charm?

177
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,229
我我我
Kids: Me, me, me, me.

178
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:16,859
这就是我胜利的原因
This is what it takes to win.

179
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,654
每场比赛 我爷爷都会在车里陪我
Every race, I've got my grandpa Big Ed with me in the car.

180
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:24,950
他教会了我怎么当一个赛车手 以及怎么做一个好人
He taught me what it takes to be a racecar driver and a good man.

181
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,660
所以谁想坐坐驾驶座
So who wants to sit in the driver's seat?

182
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:27,911
-我我我  -拜托
Boy 1: Me, me, me, me. - Boy 2: Come on.

183
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:29,705
我第一个 我得癌了
I'm first. I got cancer.

184
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:31,248
鬼扯
Bullshit.

185
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:33,292
-你刚说什么  -没得癌
What did you just say? - You don't have cancer.

186
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:35,419
-你没得癌 小骗子  -想得美 蠢货
You don't have cancer, you fucking liar. - Nice try, dipshit.

187
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,297
嗨 这就没必要了
Charlie: Hey. No need for all that.

188
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:43,844
要是那孩子真有癌症
You know, if that kid did have cancer,

189
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:46,305
那你很快就要尴尬得下不来台了
that could have gotten real awkward real quick.

190
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:48,098
不会 我有个本事
Nah, I got this thing.

191
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,517
我就像那种能闻出什么的狗
I'm like the, the dog that can smell, uh...

192
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:52,186
癌症吗
Cancer?

193
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:54,521
行吧 也可以这么说
Uh, sure. Uh, yes.

194
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:57,316
差不多但我能看出一个人是不是鬼扯
Uh, I'm like that but with bullshit.

195
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:59,193
我听到就能知道
You know, I hear it, I know it.

196
00:14:59,194 --> 00:14:59,985
你也有可能错的
Could have been wrong.

197
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:02,112
那我的准确率会震撼到你
Well, stunning accuracy.

198
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:03,655
你可以来试试
Step right up.

199
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:07,284
来 我来
Here, let me...

200
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:09,703
不用 你用不着
Oh. Oh no. You don't have to, uh...

201
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,874
没事 在有拖车活儿进来之前
Hey. Figure I'll help out around here

202
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,334
我都会在这里帮忙
until a tow call comes in.

203
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:18,378
所以怎么着 你是开拖车的
So what, so°you drive aja tow truckjhuh? 0 160 180 20(

204
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:20,798
就是说赛车赚不了大钱呗
So racing isn't paying the big bucks 180

205
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,049
你知道我今天赢了什么吗
You know what I won today?

206
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,842
油钱加上一碗象征性的桃子
Gas money and a ceremonial bowl of peaches.

207
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:27,054
这项运动对我这种小人物并不友好
This sport's rigged against the little guys like me

208
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:28,806
你要知道 起码要花75000美元
You know, it takes at least$75, 000 UU

209
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:30,557
你的赛车才能上赛场
to keep a car on the racetrack, minimum ZUU

210
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:32,017
基斯·欧文斯估计在他车上
Keith Owens probably spends UU

211
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:34,812
砸的钱能是我的十倍 可我还是赢他了
ten times that much on his car, and I still beat him

212
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:37,064
幸好他那属于绣花拳头
Good thing he can't punch his way out of a paper bag.

213
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:39,399
-几乎不疼  -净鬼扯
- It barely hurts. - Well, bullshit.

214
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,027
-你又知道了哈  -是啊 我又知道了
Uh, cause of your thing, right? Yeah, because of that.

215
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:44,446
现在他闺女想闪亮登场
Davis. And now his daughter's gonna waltz into the sport.

216
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:46,824
她连最新型号的车都没开过 一次都没有
She hasn't even raced a late model. Not once.

217
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:48,659
赞助商就争先恐后的
And sponsors are going to be falling all over themselves,

218
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,494
想把自己名字印她车上
trying to get their name on her car.

219
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:52,788
天 挺俊一小伙子
Gosh, you really got a lot of road rage bubbling

220
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,998
怎么这么愤青啊
under those bright eyes of yours, huh, kid?

221
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:56,500
可能吧
Yeah, I guess so.

222
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:57,668
我问你件事儿啊
So, uh, let me ask you something.

223
00:15:57,669 --> 00:15:59,670
就赛车这事儿
This whole, uh, racing thing,

224
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:02,172
我有点不理解
I think I kind of don't get it.

225
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:04,007
停车场那辆69年酷鱼
Aren't you the one with the 69 Barracuda

226
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,008
不是你的吗
in the parking lot?

227
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,261
经典美国肌肉车
An all- American muscle classic?

228
00:16:07,262 --> 00:16:09,638
是 但是 是这样 那辆车能让我有地方可去
Yes, but you see, that, that gets me places,

229
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,265
严格上来说车也就是这用途
which is technically what a car is for.

230
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:14,268
你们不过就是在转圈圈
You are just going in circles.

231
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,688
我是说 你们不过就是一直在
I mean, you're basically just turning left

232
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:19,273
往左转
a bunch of times.

233
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:20,566
你是这么认为的吗
That's what youi think?

234
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:27,322
好 只需要踩油门 往左转
Okay. So just hit the gas and turn left.

235
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:28,866
能有多难
How hard could it be?

236
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:32,911
不得不说 这机器的感觉
Well. Gotta say, this is very, uh, intense

237
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:35,289
做的还是相当不错的
with the haptics and whatnot.

238
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,499
现在加速
Uh- huh. Now accelerate.

239
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:41,211
靠 我怎么这么怕撞车
Geez, why am I so afraid of crashing?

240
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:43,088
不过就是个街机游戏罢了
I mean, it's just an arcade game.

241
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,048
额滴神 差点啊
Holy Toledo! That was very close.

242
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:46,383
你看到了没 差点就翻了
Did you see that? That was very close.

243
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:47,926
现在 等到路尽头的时候
Now, when you get to the end of the front stretch,

244
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,761
直接把车头点进拐弯
point the car into the turn.

245
00:16:49,762 --> 00:16:52,723
冲着赛道底
Towards the bottom of the racetrack. - Mm- hmm.

246
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:55,058
好
Alright.

247
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:56,727
你踩油门了吗
Is your foot even on the gas?

248
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:57,895
别让我分心
Don't distract me.

249
00:16:57,896 --> 00:16:59,229
好 下一个弯
Davis: Okay, for this next turn,

250
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,397
我们得做个漂移
we need to do a fishhook,

251
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,024
但你要相信车子
but you got to trust the car.

252
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:03,525
你相信车子吗
Do you trust the car?

253
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:05,819
-这是个街机游戏  -这不是
Well, it's an arcade game. No, it isn't.

254
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,364
你在泥泞的赛道上 引擎在你耳边咆哮
You're on a dirt track, engine screaming in your ears

255
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:12,242
人群在嚎叫 时间仿佛都慢了下来
crowd's roaring, time's slowing down.

256
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:13,785
相信你的车
Trust the car.

257
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,747
我不相信车
I don't trust the car.

258
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,584
你必须相信车
Davis: You gotta trust the car.

259
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:22,711
好 好 去他妈的 反正不是真的
Okay. Okay. Fuck it. It's fake anyway.

260
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:24,004
很好 很好
Good. Good, good.

261
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:26,548
再快点 加速
Faster. Faster.

262
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,218
我一下囗令 就猛踩油门方向盘打死 准备好了没
When I say, slam on the gas hard and turn hard. Ready?

263
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:30,427
-没  -就现在
- I am not. - Now!

264
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:36,975
小贱人
Little bitch.

265
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:38,310
-太可怕了  -是啊
Terrible. - Yes.

266
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:39,436
-很差  -很差
Bad. Bad.

267
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:41,814
-最低分  -是啊
F minus. - Ah yeah.

268
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:43,524
-是啊  -靠
Yeah. Geez.

269
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:46,193
好吧好吧 你赢了 你赢了
Okay. Okay. Okay. You win. You win. You win.

270
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:47,945
我跟你说 假的赛车也
You know what, fake racing is, uh,

271
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:49,530
比看起来要难
it's harder than it looks.

272
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:54,284
不行不行 哥们儿 别这样
Oh, no, no, no, man. Come on.

273
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:56,620
听着孩子 这不过就是街机邂逅罢了
Listen, kid, it's just an arcade romance.

274
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:59,081
很蠢的 太混乱了
It's, it's dumb. It's, it's messy.

275
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:00,207
会弄巧成拙
It's self- defeating.

276
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,625
你这辈子可不想有这么一段
No, you don't want this in your life.

277
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:04,837
-值得一试  -行吧 尊重
Worth a shot. Yes. I respect it.

278
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:06,964
嘿 拖车仔
Katy: Hey, tow truckl

279
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:08,549
我知道你在里头
I know you're in here.

280
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,467
我看见你那破车跟外头停着了
I saw your shitkicker outside.

281
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,469
干嘛啊 宝贝乖女儿 你不是应该
What's up, daddy's girl? Shouldn't you be, like,

282
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,971
在涂脚指甲之类的吗
painting your toenails or some shit?

283
00:18:13,972 --> 00:18:16,306
要不我们现在就在赛道上
Katy: What do you say we settle this shit right now

284
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:17,432
解决这问题怎么样
on the track?

285
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:19,017
你是说小赛道嘛
On the little track, you mean?

286
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,686
因为我们都知道你亲爱的爹不让你开大人车呢
Cause we know Daddy won't let you get in a big boy car.

287
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:22,563
不管什么赛道我都能打得你屁滚尿流
I can smoke your ass on any track.

288
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:24,523
-那就来吧  -来吧
Come on then. - Boy: Come on, guys.

289
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:26,108
让你见识见识真本事
Now you get to see the real thing.

290
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:29,778
T1
快走
Boy: Let's go!

291
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:36,577
冲呀
Go, go, go!

292
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:54,011
哇哦
Whoa!

293
00:18:56,764 --> 00:18:58,056
再来一次吗
Again?

294
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:13,447
再来一次不
gain?

295
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,544
好好适应下吧 拖车仔
Get used to it, Tow Truck.

296
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:28,754
你下半辈子都会
Youre going to be losing to my family

297
00:19:28,755 --> 00:19:30,214
继续输给我们家的人
forthe rest of your life.

298
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:37,638
嘿 吉恩 要捎你回家不
Ooh. Hey, Jean. You need a ride home?

299
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,891
靠 出什么事儿了
Geez, what the fuck happened?

300
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:43,435
他一脸“老子要干蠢事”的表情
He had that "about to do something stupid"look.

301
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:01,662
嗨各位 我是戴维斯
Davis: Hey, guys, Davis here.

302
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,580
我知道比赛结束了 但我还有
I know the race is over, but I felt like making

303
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:04,957
一个地方要去
one last pitstop.

304
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,583
-不是吧  -我受够了
Really? - I'm done.

305
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,377
我受够那家人了
I'm done taking that family's shit

306
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:09,795
你想想你自己的家人
You think about your own family.

307
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:11,505
你外公会怎么说
What would Big Ed say about this?

308
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:12,714
他会说”没错 孩子“
He'd say, "Hell yeah, boy.

309
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:13,757
干掉那帮混蛋
Take those fuckers out. "

310
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:15,634
在赛道上干掉他们
Ah, ah, ah. On the track.

311
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:18,971
你外公心里也有同样的魔鬼
Big Ed had that same devil inside him,

312
00:20:18,972 --> 00:20:21,265
但他把一切都通过车发泄出来
but he put it all behind the wheel.

313
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:25,269
这就是他能一直赛车 而不是进监狱的原因
And that is what kept him on the track and out of jail.

314
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,104
在赛道上报复回去
Do it all but on the track.

315
00:20:27,814 --> 00:20:28,814
明白吗
Yes?

316
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:52,004
你车坏了吗还是怎么的
Did you break down or somethin'?

317
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,048
好 给我15分钟
Alright. Give me 15.

318
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:00,304
要拖车呢
That was a tow call.

319
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:01,805
-这就去 我来吧  -不行
I'm on it. I got it- Oh no, no.

320
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:03,390
你哪儿都不能去
You ain't going anywhere.

321
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:05,517
你要冷静一下 醒醒酒
You need to cool off and sober up.

322
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:07,144
明天第一件事 你就去把
And first thing tomorrow, you're going to fix

323
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:09,146
欧文斯家的邮箱修好 给人道歉
the Owens mailbox and apologize.

324
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:14,234
我那破钥匙跑哪儿去了
Now where are my goddamn keys.

325
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,089
靠
Oh shit.

326
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,218
靠了
Shit.

327
00:24:10,495 --> 00:24:12,579
稳扎稳打 不过是练习
Greg: Smooth and steady. Just practice.

328
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,164
不要冒险
No need to take chances.

329
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:16,625
在这儿呢 美国甜心
There she is. America s sweetheart.

330
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:20,170
不想跟我说话是吗
You're not talking to me?

331
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:22,798
行吧 对不起把你邮箱弄坏了
Okay. I'm sorry for jacking your mailbox.

332
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,175
我当时气坏了 尽管只是卡丁车比赛
I was pissed, even though it was just go- karts.

333
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:26,844
我才不管是不是正式赛车
I don't care if it's fucking big wheels.

334
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:28,554
只要是赛车 我就能赢翻你
When it comes to racing, I'll kick your ass

335
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:29,763
随时随地
anytime, anywhere.

336
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:31,557
除非你爸交出赛车的钥匙
You ain't kicking shit until Daddy hands over

337
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:32,558
你什么都赢不了
the keys to the money wagon.

338
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,017
-滚吧  -听着
Fuck off. - Davis: Look,

339
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:36,854
咱俩可以坐这儿聊一整天
we can sit here and talk shit all day long,

340
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:39,398
或者一次性解决问题
or we can settle this once and for all.

341
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:44,278
上周 我在这儿开出了20.3秒
Last week, I went around here in 20. 3 seconds.

342
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:46,989
你觉得自己能打破这个记录吗
You think you could beat it?

343
00:24:48,324 --> 00:24:49,741
请
Be my guest.

344
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:53,036
来吧 练习一圈而已
Come on. Just a practice lap.

345
00:24:53,037 --> 00:24:53,871
最好在我改主意之前换衣服
Better hurry and suit up before I change my mind

346
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,080
最好在我改主意之前换衣服
Better hurry and suit up before I change my mind.

347
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:10,053
什么情况 兰迪
Jean: What's happening, Randy?

348
00:25:10,054 --> 00:25:13,223
他在赛道上 给车热身
He's out there on the track, taking her easy.

349
00:25:13,224 --> 00:25:15,934
欧文斯是真想刺激他
And Owens is really trying to goad him

350
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:18,145
好 他们马上就要进入到第一条直道了
Alright. They're coming into the first straightaway.

351
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:41,084
我们刚刚目睹了戴维斯·麦克道尔的车
Reporter: We have just witnessed Davis McDowell's car

352
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:43,086
在第一个转弯处撞墙
smash into the wall at turn one.

353
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:46,298
他好像没有在动
He doesn't appear to be moving.

354
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:49,384
看上去情况不妙
This is not looking good

355
00:25:51,638 --> 00:25:53,305
戴维斯
Jean: Davis!

356
00:25:58,394 --> 00:25:59,978
凯特
Gregi Katel

357
00:26:03,107 --> 00:26:05,108
-他没事吧  -不不不
He alright? Greg No, no, no.

358
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:08,111
基斯
                                                                                                      Keith...

359
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:09,571
车里的是凯蒂
Katy was in the car.

360
00:26:19,165 --> 00:26:22,209
亲爱的 谢天谢地
Jean: Honey! Oh thank God

361
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,337
-我天  -我没事 妈 我没事
Oh, my God. Okay. I'm alright, Mom. I'm alright.

362
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:06,462
天呐
lesus

363
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:08,464
如大家所知
Reporter: As many of you already know,

364
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:11,175
19岁的凯蒂·欧文斯
19 year- old Katy Owens is in a coma

365
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:12,593
昨日在桃树赛道练习时发生严重事故
at Glencoe Memorial Hospital after a horrible crash

366
00:27:12,594 --> 00:27:14,219
昨日在桃树赛道练习时发生严重事故
at Glencoe Memorial Hospital after a horrible crash

367
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:16,889
至今在格伦科纪念医院昏迷不醒
during practice yesterday at Peach Tree Speedway.

368
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,681
他们说她安全带坏了
They're saying her seat belt failed.

369
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:18,807
他们说她安全带坏了
They're saying her seat belt failed.

370
00:27:18,808 --> 00:27:21,768
你什么意思 是说她安全带失灵了
Oh. What do you mean? Like, her seatbelt didn't work?

371
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:24,730
-没起到作用  -这都什么意思
It failed. What does that even mean?

372
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:28,108
就是滑开了 所以她伤势才这么严重
It gave way That's, that's why the injury was so severe.

373
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:29,693
同时 我们祝愿凯蒂早日康复
In the meantime, we wish Katy a speedy recovery,

374
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:30,444
同时 我们祝愿凯蒂早日康复
In the meantime, we wish Katy a speedy recovery,

375
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:32,029
也会为欧文斯一家
and we're keeping, the Owens family

376
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,405
祈祷
in our thoughts and prayers.

377
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:35,240
天
God.

378
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:36,408
戴维斯怎么会
What the hell was Davis thinking

379
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:38,118
让她开那辆车呢
letting her drive that car?

380
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,411
嘿 妈
Hey, Mom.

381
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:44,500
刚两个小时
I just spent the last two hours

382
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:46,418
警察都在审问我凯蒂车祸的事
getting the third degree about Katy's crash.

383
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:48,629
现在他们在说要我停赛
And now they re talking about suspending me.

384
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,588
什么
Jean: What?

385
00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:51,757
那姑娘很可怜是没错但是靠
The poor girl, yeah, but Jesus.

386
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:54,927
她撞车是因为她自己无能
She crashed because of her own incompetence.

387
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:56,094
现在连我都被连累了
And now I'm going to get burned.

388
00:27:56,095 --> 00:27:58,096
鬼扯
Well, bullshit.

389
00:27:58,097 --> 00:28:00,724
不好意思 本能反应
Oh, I...Sorry. Sorry. It's, uh, instinct.

390
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:01,725
我只是
I just

391
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:03,393
严格来说这都算不上是撒谎
That wasn't even a lie technically,

392
00:28:03,394 --> 00:28:05,646
别往心里去 抱歉
so just never mind. Sorry.

393
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,064
不 你想说什么 说吧
No, what? Tell me.

394
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:09,650
只是你嘴上说她撞车
It's just when you said that she crashed

395
00:28:09,651 --> 00:28:11,860
囚为自己无能 但你心里并不这么想
because of her own incompetence, you didn't believe that,

396
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:13,195
所以我就
so I just

397
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:17,074
这是我本能 我嗅得出来 抱歉抱歉
It's instinctual. Cancer dog. Sorry. Sorry.

398
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:19,076
你说的太对了
You're 100 percent right.

399
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,577
我是真不信
I don't believe it.

400
00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:22,871
这一切都太不对劲了
Something about all of this doesn't sit right.

401
00:28:22,872 --> 00:28:24,331
怎么不对劲儿
Sit right how?

402
00:28:24,332 --> 00:28:26,041
所有训练你都录下来了 对吗
Davis: You record all the practices, right?

403
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:27,918
-你知道的  -昨天的也是吧
You know it. - Yesterday's too?

404
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,088
看她开的路线
Davis: Look at the line she takes.

405
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:32,381
这是什么鬼
What the hell is that?

406
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:33,966
那又怎样 她犯了个错误
What? So, so she made a mistake.

407
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:36,009
一个好车手不会犯这种错误
She's too good of a driver to make that mistake.

408
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,594
-那个弯道  -油门踩太紧了
That turn. Way too deep.

409
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:39,763
用力过猛 直接撞到了墙上 就像是
Way too hard, straight into the wall. It's almost like...

410
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:41,265
-绝对是  -你觉得吗
Randy: It's totally like. - You think?

411
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,599
-是的  -你俩心有灵犀的脑电波
- I do- Charlie: You want to cut me in

412
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,226
能给我讲讲吗
on this grease- monkey mind meld.

413
00:28:44,227 --> 00:28:45,394
就像是
Seems like there is...

414
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:47,146
车子出了问题
Both: Something wrong with the car.

415
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:48,438
他们不检查的吗
Don't they inspect it or something?

416
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:50,149
训练前一晚 我们
Night before practice, went over it

417
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,275
进行过一次细致检查
with a fine- toothed comb.

418
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:53,068
论检查赛车 我兄弟是专业的
My man can tooth a race car.

419
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:57,156
好吧 也许是有部件坏了
Okay, so maybe something broke.

420
00:28:57,157 --> 00:28:58,949
车被拖回我车库了
Well, they towed it back to my garage.

421
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,826
不妨去看一眼
Maybe it's worth a look, right?

422
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:04,329
我们在找什么呢
What are we looking for?

423
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,664
一切可疑迹象
Anything that looks funny.

424
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:22,264
-什么鬼  -这是什么
What the hell? - Randy: What's that?

425
00:29:22,265 --> 00:29:23,474
这很可疑吗
Does that look funny?

426
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:24,933
你的引擎里会有鱼钩吗
Do you have a fishhook in your engine?

427
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:28,604
没 但那里确实住过一家老鼠 所以
No, but I did have a family of mice living there once, so...

428
00:29:28,605 --> 00:29:30,814
老鼠也不行
Well, they weren't supposed to be there either.

429
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:33,108
应该是被人放进去的
Somebody put that there.

430
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:35,861
好吧 鱼钩怎么可能
Okay. How could a, a fishhook

431
00:29:35,862 --> 00:29:37,404
导致车祸
make a car crash?

432
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:39,114
车在全速行驶状态下
Well, if the car was going full speed,

433
00:29:39,115 --> 00:29:41,116
也就是她的情况
which it appeared to be,

434
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:44,286
化油器会张开
carburetor would be wide open.

435
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:45,954
操
Oh shit.

436
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:48,749
如果鱼钩连在橡胶纽带上
If the hook was attached to a gear tie,

437
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,501
就会挂住
it would catch.

438
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:53,128
纽带已经融化了 但 天啊
Randy: Well, the tie could have melted off, but damn.

439
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:55,130
就算脚从油门上移开
Even if you took your foot off the gas,

440
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:56,673
也没有办法减速
there ain't no way to decelerate.

441
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:58,300
天啊
Oh, my God.

442
00:29:58,301 --> 00:29:59,635
我不明白
I don't get it.

443
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:01,887
所以凯蒂在第一弯道转得那么硬
That's why Katy went into turn one so hard.

444
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:03,305
她慢不下来
She couldn't slow down.

445
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,476
这车本来是我开的
That was supposed to be for me.

446
00:30:07,477 --> 00:30:09,645
有人破坏了我的车
Somebody sabotaged my car.

447
00:30:09,646 --> 00:30:10,687
嗯 什么
Huh? What?

448
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,315
不 不 不 不会吧
No. No, no, no. Come on. Come on.

449
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:16,401
太疯狂了 谁会那么做
Man, that, that's insane, okay. Who would do that?

450
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,448
不 不 不
Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

451
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:24,034
他知道他赢不了我 所以破坏了我的车
He knew he couldn't beat me, so he sabotaged my car.

452
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:25,994
-不是的  -我绝对肯定
Oh no. - I have no doubt.

453
00:30:25,995 --> 00:30:26,954
我有撒谎吗
Am I lying?

454
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:28,247
不 你没撒谎
No, you're not lying.

455
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:29,832
但是 你知道的 先深呼吸
But, you know, just take a breath.

456
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,834
你前一晚检查了你的车
You checked your car the night before,

457
00:30:31,835 --> 00:30:34,753
到赛场之后车就没离开你视线
and you were with it the whole time at the track.

458
00:30:34,754 --> 00:30:35,879
-所以  -没错
so truth

459
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,089
有人捣鬼我们会看到的
We would have seen someone messing with it.

460
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,423
是
Charlie: Yeah.

461
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:40,551
昨晚训练前有人打来拖车电话
A tow call came in last night before practice,

462
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:42,177
但最后发现是恶作剧
but it ended up being a prank.

463
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:43,971
我敢说是欧文斯打的电话
I bet it was Owens who made the call

464
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:47,015
让我离开那里 好破坏我的车
to get me out of the house so he can sabotage my car.

465
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:48,976
那个阴险小人
That conniving little bitch.

466
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:50,394
他想杀了我
He fucking tried to kill mel

467
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:52,688
我要让基斯·欧文斯坐轮椅
I'm going to put Keith Owens in a fucking wheelchair.

468
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:54,064
-兰道尔  -说干就干 宝贝
Randall. - Let's roll, baby.

469
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,357
好了 你俩站住
Okay. Nobody's rolling.

470
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:56,817
谁也不许让谁坐轮椅
Nobody's putting anybody in a wheelchair.

471
00:30:56,818 --> 00:30:59,194
-你拦得住我吗  -听我说
Try and stop me. - Charlie: Listen to me.

472
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:01,530
你现在不能去追究基斯
You can't go after Keith right now.

473
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:03,740
他女儿都昏迷了
The man's daughter is in a coma.

474
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:06,994
好嘛 记得昨晚的烛光守夜祈祷不
Alright? Remember last night's candlelight prayer vigil.

475
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,954
明晚就是给基斯守夜了
And there's going to be another one tomorrow for Keith.

476
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:09,997
把蜡烛准备好吧
Get the candles ready.

477
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:11,456
别这样两位 别犯傻
Charlie: No, guys, stop being stupid.

478
00:31:11,457 --> 00:31:12,624
好吗 理智点
Alright? Really?

479
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:15,836
我去和他谈谈
I'll go talk to him.

480
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,547
你可以去嗅嗅他
You can cancer dog him.

481
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:21,175
真后悔用了这个比喻
Well, I'm regretting settling on that metaphor,

482
00:31:21,176 --> 00:31:23,719
不过 对 我可以去嗅嗅他
di JRLES but, yes, I can cancer dog him.

483
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,763
如果他说谎 我就能嗅到
Uh, if he's lying, I'll know it.

484
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:29,808
然后你们俩就能像《生死狂澜》里一样对他了 好吗
Then you two can go full"Deliverance" on him. Okay?

485
00:31:32,312 --> 00:31:34,688
没反应是吧 那部电影可棒了
Nothing, huh? Great movie.

486
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,695
你好
Charlie: Hi.

487
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:44,364
有事吗
Yes.

488
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:46,408
呃 我
Oh, uh, I'm, uh,

489
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:48,035
我是查莉·凯尔
I'm Charlie Cale.

490
00:31:49,496 --> 00:31:51,997
我在卡丁车场工作
I work at the, uh, the go- kart track.

491
00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:52,623
好
Okay.

492
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:59,087
吉恩让我把这些带过来
Uh, Jean wanted me to bring these by.

493
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:01,715
她说 想让你知道
She said, uh, she just wants you to know

494
00:32:01,716 --> 00:32:04,134
她记挂着你和你家人
that she's thinking about you and your family.

495
00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:06,136
好
Okay.

496
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:08,764
代我向她道谢
Tell her I said thanks.

497
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:09,640
好的
Charlie: Yeah.

498
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:11,099
你放前面吧
You can leave em out front.

499
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,897
虽然我来的时间不长
You know, I haven't been here long,

500
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:20,234
但我知道凯蒂是个很棒的车手
but I, I know that Katys a great driver.

501
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:24,738
虽然只是开卡丁车 但我亲眼见过
I know it's justlgo- karts, but I saw her myself and, uh,

502
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:26,156
她很特别
she is special.

503
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:29,326
她有天赋
She has the gift.

504
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:31,078
跟她的爷爷一样
Like her grandfather.

505
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,204
也就是我父亲
My father.

506
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:38,961
我没有的天赋
I never had it.

507
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:46,135
你喜欢钓鱼吗
Oh, uh, are you a big fishing guy?

508
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:51,306
我说过了 你可以把花放门口
Like I said, you can leave those out front.

509
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:54,685
我这么问是因为
I only ask because, uh,

510
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:56,478
戴维斯拿回他的车时
so when Davis got his car back,

511
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:58,438
他说引擎里有个
he said that there was a,

512
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:01,733
像鱼钩一样的东西
like a fishhook in the engine, uh.

513
00:33:02,652 --> 00:33:04,945
这挺蹊跷的吧 我
That's a funny thing, right? I, L

514
00:33:04,946 --> 00:33:07,614
不管怎样 他是个急性子
Anyway, hot- headed kid that he is.

515
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:09,825
他说他觉得
So he was saying he thinks that

516
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:11,660
是有人故意放进去的
maybe somebody put it there,

517
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:14,288
要破坏引擎
like tampered with the engine.

518
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:16,165
这也太扯了 你说对吗
I mean, that's crazy, right?

519
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:21,462
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who the hell you are

520
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:23,505
也不知道你来干什么
or what this is about,

521
00:33:23,506 --> 00:33:25,924
但我没碰那小鬼的车
but Ididn't touch that kid's car.

522
00:33:28,845 --> 00:33:30,220
我们讲完了吗
So are we done?

523
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:35,267
我会把花放门口
I'll put those out front.

524
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:47,279
我很抱歉
I'm, uh, so sorry

525
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,288
怎么回事
What was that?

526
00:33:57,499 --> 00:33:58,665
没事
Nothin.

527
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:00,375
鬼扯
Bullshit.

528
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:05,380
嘿 两位
Hey, guys.

529
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:07,466
怎么了
Davis: What happened?

530
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:09,134
你是对的
So, uh, you were right.

531
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:10,761
-是他干的  -我就知道
He did it. I fucking knew it

532
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:11,929
谢谢你 谢谢你
Thank you Thank you.

533
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,014
-怎么了  -是基斯干的
Shit. What happened? - Keith did it.

534
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:15,474
-绝对是  -是的
No shit Charlie: Mm- hmm.

535
00:34:15,475 --> 00:34:17,184
-这违法犯罪啊  -是啊
Yeah. That's really illegal. - Charlie: Yeah.

536
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:20,103
听着 我们知道是他干的
So, uh, look, we know he did it, right,

537
00:34:20,104 --> 00:34:22,064
但如果真想抓住基斯
but, uh, if you really want to nail Keith,

538
00:34:22,065 --> 00:34:23,857
我们需要铁证 警察要的那种证据
we're gonna need hard evidence, cop evidence.

539
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:26,026
给车来个《犯罪现场调查》
We need, like, a CSI for cars.

540
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:28,529
我们首先要把鱼钩放密封袋甲
First thing we need to do is take that fishhook, put it in a Ziploc.

541
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,031
对 我们要查找车库里的指纹 车胎痕 其他证据
Yeah, we check the garage for prints, tracks, traces

542
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:32,699
我叔雷蒙德有个黑光灯
My Uncle Raymond's got a black light.

543
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,327
虽然他不是干这个用的 但应该也行
That ain't what he uses it for, but it should work.

544
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:38,455
好吧 你俩越说越搞笑了
Well, this is about to get comedic, isn't it?

545
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:40,123
嘿 不要跑
Hey. Hey. No running

546
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:42,584
不要跑
No running!

547
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:44,711
什么情况啊
What the hell?

548
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:46,338
桃树赛道的
Keith: The night before practice

549
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:49,049
-训练前一晚  -借过
at Peachtree Speedway Excuse me.

550
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,844
我溜进了戴维斯·麦克道尔的车库
Keith: ...I snuck into Davis McDowell's garage,

551
00:34:51,845 --> 00:34:54,054
对他的赛车动了手脚
and I tampered with his race carl

552
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:56,765
对
Yes.

553
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:00,894
我想让戴维斯撞车 可是
I wanted Davis to crash, but

554
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:03,188
我绝没有想伤害任何人
I never meant for anyone to get hurt.

555
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,941
尤其是凯蒂
Especially not Katy.

556
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:08,986
但坐在方向盘后的
That it was Katy

557
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:11,155
是凯蒂
behind the wheel of that car

558
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:13,824
命运开了个可怕的玩笑
was a horrible twist of fate.

559
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:16,076
我则要背负着它
And something that I, will have to livejwith

560
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:19,079
度过今后余生
for the rest of my days.

561
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,914
谢谢
Thank you.

562
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,461
我得接个电话
have to take this.

563
00:35:25,462 --> 00:35:26,545
基斯 欧文斯的忏悔
Reporter A shattering confession

564
00:35:26,546 --> 00:35:27,588
令人震惊
from Keith Owens, V

565
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:28,964
当局宣称 他
who, according to authorities,

566
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:31,091
用鱼钩和橡胶纽带
sabotaged a competitor's car

567
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:32,926
蓄意破坏竞争对手的赛车
with a fishing hook and gear tie.

568
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:34,970
好吧 总算有个交代了
Well, Iguess that's that.

569
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:36,847
天
Man.

570
00:35:36,848 --> 00:35:39,808
报应也是一种后果
Karma's like some kind of consequence

571
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,644
同意
I agree.

572
00:35:42,645 --> 00:35:45,564
报应本身就是一种后果
Karma is like a consequencel

573
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:48,358
好的 先生 我2分钟后到
Yes, sir. Yes, I'll be there in 20.

574
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:51,320
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

575
00:35:52,906 --> 00:35:54,865
是警察 他们需要看看车
Cops. They need to see the car.

576
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:57,618
搞搞犯罪现场调查里演的那套
Lots of stuff. CSI car stuff, I guess.

577
00:35:57,619 --> 00:35:59,745
是啊 我天啊
Yeah, well, shit, huh?

578
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:02,039
还是不敢相信 基斯真做得出来
I can't believe it. Keith did it.

579
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,373
他今后再也不能比赛了
And now he's never going to race again,

580
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:07,044
也就是说 冠军他妈的是我的了
which means I fuckin' won the championship.

581
00:36:07,045 --> 00:36:09,338
也就是说 他的赞助商和
That means his sponsors and

582
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:11,131
总之 我妈妈再也不用工作了
My mom won't have to work anymore.

583
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:13,884
我知道日前情况很复杂
Hey, I know this is a complicated situation,

584
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:15,928
但是恭喜了
but congratulations.

585
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:17,137
你什么都没做错
You didn't do anything wrong,

586
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:18,806
你心里现在有些沾沾自喜
and it's alright for a part of you

587
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:20,766
也没问题
to feel good right now.

588
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:25,145
-抱歉  -没事
Sorry Yeah, no

589
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:27,314
该干什么干什么吧 回见了
Do your thing Tll catch you later. Alright?

590
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:28,440
恭喜
Congratulations.

591
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:34,947
嘿 科特
Hey, Curt.

592
00:36:34,948 --> 00:36:36,740
怎么了 你没事吧
What happened? You okay?

593
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:39,660
-我不敢开车  -什么 为什么
I'm scared to race. - What? Why?

594
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:41,662
安全带不管用
Seatbelts don't work.

595
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:43,664
你的安全带没事 小家伙
Your seatbelt's fine, buddy.

596
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:45,791
凯蒂的安全带就没管用
Curt: Katy's seatbelt didn't work.

597
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:47,501
所以她才住院了
That's why she's in the hospital.

598
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:49,044
不是 嘿 听我说
Davis: No, hey, listen to me.

599
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:50,420
你的安全带没问题
Your seatbelt is safe.

600
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:52,965
兰迪会确保这一点的 他一直都有检查
Randy makes sure of that. He checks it all the time.

601
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:54,675
嘿 看着我
Hey, look at me.

602
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:56,468
发生在凯蒂身上的事只是凑巧
What happened to Katy was a fluke.

603
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:59,638
她的安全带失灵就只是个可怕的意外
Her seatbelt malfunction was a freak accident.

604
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,557
鬼扯
Bullshit.

605
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:12,609
嘿 兰迪
Hey, uh, Randy.

606
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,905
凯蒂的安全带到底是怎么了
So what happened to Katy's seatbelt again?

607
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:18,574
我是说 为什么会断呢
I mean, why'd it break?

608
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:21,160
应该是老化了吧 正常磨损
Uh, it was old probably. Just wear and tear.

609
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:27,124
在每次赛车之前安全带都会有人检查吗
And do they get checked or inspected before each race?

610
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,292
不会 小姐
Randy: Uh, no, ma'am.

611
00:37:28,293 --> 00:37:30,335
安全带跟底盘胎压什么的
Seatbelt's not like a chassis adjustment

612
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:31,462
可不一样
or, or tire pressure,

613
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:33,839
联机就能调整
something you can adjust on the fly.

614
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,759
安全带可比那复杂多了 甚至这种也一样
Belts are complicated as hell. Even these.

615
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,554
每次我要修理 赛车就必须得入库
Any time I gotta fix one, kart goes to the garage.

616
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:43,265
新型车也是一样
Same thing as a late model car.

617
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,854
嘿 吉恩 你看到戴维斯了吗
Oh, hey, Jean, uh, you seen Davis?

618
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:53,984
你没事吧
You alright?

619
00:37:54,235 --> 00:37:55,819
他居然闯入了我的车库
He broke into my garage.

620
00:37:56,696 --> 00:37:58,405
太无情了
The cold- bloodedness of that.

621
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:01,575
天 我 我没想到这一点
Gee, I...I didn't think about that.

622
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:03,327
事情发生时你也在
You were there when that happened.

623
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:05,204
太可怕了 抱歉
That's intense. I'm sorry.

624
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:07,664
我 我没在家
I, I wasn't home.

625
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:10,667
-什么  -我出去拖车了
What? - Oh, I was out on a tow call.

626
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,419
-和戴维斯一起吗  -当然没
With Davis? Oh God, no.

627
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:15,005
他做完那蠢事 我就让他上床睡觉了
After what he did, I sent that boy to bed.

628
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:17,466
我不能整晚坐在这里
I can't sit here all night.

629
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:19,676
我得去补点指尖陀螺的货了
I got to go restock the fidget spinners.

630
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:20,719
好
Okay.

631
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,740
靠
Ah, shit.

632
00:38:43,076 --> 00:38:45,744
他们把车带去犯罪现场汽车检验室了
They took it to the CSI car lab.

633
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:46,662
靠 靠
Shit. Shit.

634
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:50,123
好吧
Okay.

635
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:52,751
该找什么呢
What am I looking for?

636
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,924
安全带工具
Well, seatbelt tools,

637
00:38:58,925 --> 00:39:01,135
安全带碎片不知道
seatbelt fragments, I don't know.

638
00:39:02,512 --> 00:39:05,097
太好了 要找的是我也不知道长什么样的东西
Great. Things I don't know what they look like.

639
00:39:05,098 --> 00:39:06,431
我到底来干嘛
What the fuck am I doing?

640
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:07,975
天
Oh, geez.

641
00:39:12,272 --> 00:39:15,065
嘿 外公 你有什么建议吗
Hey, Big Ed. You got any advice for me?

642
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:21,697
靠
Oh shit.

643
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:29,454
好吧
Alright

644
00:39:29,455 --> 00:39:32,124
东西在这儿呢 妈 你落在车库里了
They're in here, Mom. You left them in the garage!

645
00:40:01,988 --> 00:40:03,155
嘿
Davis: Hey.

646
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:06,325
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

647
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:07,951
是你动了凯蒂的安全带吗
Did you mess with Katy's seatbelt?

648
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:09,995
我干嘛了
Did I what?

649
00:40:09,996 --> 00:40:11,205
天
Well, geez.

650
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:13,499
听我说
Look- -

651
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,211
你告诉科特 凯蒂的安全带没起作用
Well, you told Curt that Katy's seatbelt failing

652
00:40:17,212 --> 00:40:18,504
是个可怕的意外
was a freak accident,

653
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:21,006
但你撒谎了
but that was a lie.

654
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,175
你说什么呢
What are you talkin' about?

655
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,845
还有 我意识到
Also, uh, I realized that,

656
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:29,515
就在你给我和兰迪看发动机的时候
well, when you showed me and Randy the engine,

657
00:40:29,516 --> 00:40:31,141
里面有个鱼钩状的东西
there was a fishhook in it, and,

658
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:34,561
你说那个东西上如果连着橡胶纽带
and you said that if it was attached to a gear tie,

659
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:36,855
会让化油器打开
it would keep the carburetor open.

660
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:40,984
对 基斯就是这么做的
Yeah. And that's what Keith did.

661
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,403
对 但是为什么不是
Right. But couldn't it have been

662
00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:47,741
一段电线或者牙线呢
a piece of wire or dental floss.

663
00:40:47,742 --> 00:40:51,036
为什么不是鱼线呢
Hell, why not a fishing line?

664
00:40:51,037 --> 00:40:52,538
他可以用鱼线的 对吧
He could have used fishing line, right?

665
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:53,705
我是说 任何东西都有可能
I mean, it could have been anything.

666
00:40:53,706 --> 00:40:57,084
但你说的是橡胶纽带
But you said gear tie.

667
00:40:57,085 --> 00:40:59,211
而且 而且基斯坦白时
And, and then when Keith confessed,

668
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:01,713
你怎么知道 我
what do you know, I

669
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:03,674
他用的就是那个
that's exactly what he used.

670
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:05,884
所以呢
So?

671
00:41:05,885 --> 00:41:07,094
所以
So.

672
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:10,806
你知道那东西在那
you knew it was there.

673
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:13,475
囚为你看到基斯动了手脚
Because you saw Keith do it.

674
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:15,519
他动手脚的时候你也在家
You were home when he did it.

675
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,355
然后你动了安全带
And then you messed with the seatbelts,

676
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:19,565
用安全带扳手
with the seatbelt wrenches.

677
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:22,734
你到底 安全带扳手是啥
Do you even...What's a seatbelt wrench?

678
00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:24,194
你敢说我说的都不是真的
Tell me anything I said isn't true.

679
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:25,320
说啊
Go on, say it out loud.

680
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:26,864
基斯认罪了啊
Keith confessed!

681
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:29,158
都结束了
It's over.

682
00:41:30,535 --> 00:41:33,620
你那是试图杀掉一个人啊 神经病
You tried to kill a person, you psycho.

683
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:36,165
为什么呢
And for what?

684
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:40,627
就为了一圈圈地开车吗
You know, driving a car around in a circle.

685
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:42,504
就为这
Really?

686
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:44,047
结束了 查莉
It's over, Charlie.

687
00:41:45,508 --> 00:41:47,551
而且 对
And, yeah

688
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:50,137
只要我能继续赛车 我不介意杀人
I'd kill someone for what I get on that track.

689
00:41:51,431 --> 00:41:52,806
基斯也一样

721
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:37,971
在工作台上的笑容时
Big Ed's smiling face on the workbench,

722
00:44:37,972 --> 00:44:40,307
我就知道那天
well, I knew you never had any intention

723
00:44:40,308 --> 00:44:42,684
你根本不想上车
of gettin' in your car that day.

724
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:44,311
你外公没有参赛
Big Ed wasn't on the dash

725
00:44:44,312 --> 00:44:46,146
因为你知道你的车会出事
because you knew your car was going to crash

726
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:48,816
而你不想让照片受损
and you didn't want the photo to get damaged.

727
00:44:48,817 --> 00:44:50,984
你可真够邪恶的
Well, that's some evil shit.

728
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:53,487
我的朋友 你可真是个可怕的恶魔
You, my friend, are a fuckin' monster.

729
00:44:53,488 --> 00:44:56,240
你该走了 你留在这里不安全
You should leave. It's not safe for you here.

730
00:44:57,325 --> 00:44:59,326
是 我昨晚就意识到了
Yeah, I realized that last night.

731
00:45:00,036 --> 00:45:02,204
所以今天 我
So today, I, uh,

732
00:45:02,205 --> 00:45:05,499
我没走 我去跟吉恩道了别
well, I quit the track, I said goodbye to Jean,

733
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,084
然后我
and then I, uh,

734
00:45:07,126 --> 00:45:08,752
我又去了趟医院
I stopped by the hospital.

735
00:45:08,962 --> 00:45:11,755
我跟唐娜好好谈了谈
had a, a good talk with Donna.

736
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:16,260
她告诉了我一些有关基斯的事情
So she was telling me all this interesting stuff about Keith,

737
00:45:17,095 --> 00:45:18,679
他的手感
about his flow,

738
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,557
还有当你失控的时候 会发生什么
about what happens when you, uh, when you lose it.

739
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:23,267
看着老基斯
Look at old Keith

740
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:25,018
于是他站了出来
So he stepped up in the end,

741
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:27,187
做了正确的事 那就是坦白
did the right thing, confessed.

742
00:45:27,188 --> 00:45:29,064
他还是她认识的那个人
Yeah, he's just the man she knew he was.

743
00:45:29,065 --> 00:45:31,066
天 真不错

745
00:45:35,238 --> 00:45:37,281
我又跟凯蒂好好谈了谈

没错

747
00:45:39,617 --> 00:45:41,034
她清醒了
She's totally lucid.

748
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:44,496
真是个奇迹
Sort of a miracle thing:

749
00:45:44,497 --> 00:45:47,374
医生说 她很快就能好
That doctor's saying she's gonna bounce back fast.

750
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:49,710
我跟你说
I tell you,

751
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:52,171
那个女孩谈起赛车时的样子
the way this girl talks about racing,

752

755
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:01,763
但她还会继续赛车的

而且她会超过你
