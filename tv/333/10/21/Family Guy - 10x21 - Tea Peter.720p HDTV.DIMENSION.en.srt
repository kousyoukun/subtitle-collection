12
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:41,656
Wow, congratulations on your
grand re-opening, Mort.

13
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:43,641
Looks like your customers
are comin' back.

14
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,794
Thanks, Lois. It's good
to be up and gouging again.

15
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:48,713
Oh, careful.
Watch out there, Brian.

16
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:49,981
Looks like the floor is wet.

17
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,683
Excuse me.
I'm kind of in a hurry

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,651
Son of a bitch!

19
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,253
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,772
I'm sorry. I've been
a little distracted lately.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,674
I think my wife has
been crossing the street

22
00:00:59,742 --> 00:01:00,875
with another man.

23
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,145
God, I hope Alan
doesn't find out.

24
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:05,747
Hey, forget that klutz.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,152
Hmm, maybe this one.

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,488
Hey. Lookin' at you
pretty normal, huh?

27
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:15,189
No!

28
00:01:15,257 --> 00:01:16,274
Aw, fudge.

29
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:17,508
Wait, I know!

30
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:21,646
I'll figure this out.

31
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,514
Th-the pieces are all there.

32
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:24,849
I-I'll go home
and figure this out.

33
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:29,003
Aw, cool. Hey Mort,
what's this thing?

34
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:31,606
Oh, that? That's my
"Come In! We're Open" sign.

35
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:32,924
What's that,
like an iPad?

36
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:34,409
No, it's a sign.

37
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:35,893
Wish I had one of those.

38
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:37,345
I've got a whole box
of them.

39
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,147
Take it. It's yours.
No charge.

40
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:41,349
Ugh, typical Jew.

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,687
Coming this fall

42
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:48,356
from the producers
of <i>Gone Baby</i> <i>Gone,</i>

43
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:50,324
comes the riveting sequel:

44
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:52,994
<i>Gone Severely Disabled</i>
<i>Baby Gone.</i>

45
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:55,696
I promise you we are going
to find your daughter.

46
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:57,999
Okay, but, you know,
do-do what you can,

47
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,867
but seriously, don't,
like, kill yourself.

48
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:02,570
Oh, and if you do find her,
honk this horn a couple times.

49
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:04,806
It's the only way to get her
to stop biting you.

50
00:02:04,873 --> 00:02:06,474
But again, no rush.

51
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:11,929
Peter, what
are you doing?

52
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:13,648
I'm just putting up
my new sign.

53
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:15,016
Don't put that thing
on our door.

54
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,167
If you want to hang it
somewhere,

55
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:17,718
hang it in the basement.

56
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:19,987
Oh, why? So you can hog it
while you're doing laundry?

57
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:21,722
No way.
Peter, we're not a business.

58
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,958
Hey, I saw your sign.
So, you're open?

59
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:25,426
That's right.
What do you do?

60
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:26,661
What do you need?
Milk.

61
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:28,062
We have milk.

62
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:36,304
Peter, I told you,
I don't like

63
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:38,573
all these strangers
walking around in our house.

64
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:41,442
They're not strangers, Lois;
they are our valued customers.

65
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,744
And if we don't show them
we appreciate their loyalty,

66
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,946
they're gonna go someplace else.
For what?!

67
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,215
Not to alarm anyone,

68
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:48,716
but some guy took me
in the closet

69
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:49,984
and tried me on.

70
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:52,520
She's right, Dad.
None of this makes any sense.

71
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:53,888
Meg, go take your ten.

72
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,623
And you may consider this
a verbal warning.

73
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,391
Peter, I want
these people to leave.

74
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,726
I fit,
by the way.

75
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:00,261
Lois, I'd love nothing more

76
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:01,429
than to sit here
and chat with you,

77
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:03,030
but I have a business to run.

78
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:04,682
Hi there.
May I help you folks?

79
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,984
Yes, my family and I would like
our portrait painted.

80
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:08,553
Well, you came
to the right place.

81
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,827
Looking good.

82
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:17,195
Almost done.

83
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:19,197
And... there.

84
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:20,448
Done.

85
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,001
What have you done?!

86
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:25,803
I painted the truth.

87
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,505
I painted my truth.

88
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:33,594
Gimme a spin, sweetie.

89
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:34,879
What do you think, Mom?

90
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,081
Is that the most beautiful
bride you've ever seen?

91
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:38,182
I love it!

92
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,617
Oh, it's just
so much money.

93
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,335
It's true. It's true.

94
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:42,453
Take the dress off,
sweetheart.

95
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,955
Your mother says
you can't have it.

96
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,223
W-wait, wait,
wait a minute.

97
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,474
Do you really love it?

98
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,026
I do. It just feels
like my wedding dress.

99
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:51,462
Oh, Mom, she loves it.

100
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,997
Okay.
We'll take it.

101
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:56,200
Peter, what is that girl doing
in my wedding dress?!

102
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,185
She gone?
No.

103
00:03:58,253 --> 00:03:59,387
Okay, well, while
I'm down here

104
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:00,955
let me give you my card.

105
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,490
There you go.

106
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:08,930
Here you go. A half pound of
honey maple turkey, sliced thin.

107
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:10,598
I wanted a
duplicate key made.

108
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,032
You have a good one.

109
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:13,317
Oh, hey, Joe.
What's going on?

110
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:16,120
Peter, I'm afraid
I'm here to shut you down.

111
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:17,955
You're running an
unlicensed business,

112
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,290
and that's against the law.

113
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,892
Aw, that is such bullcrap.

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,643
Well, you can't fight
City Hall.

115
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:24,478
Oh, we'll see about that!

116
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:28,783
City Hall knows karate.

117
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,352
I'm sorry, Peter, but the
government makes the rules.

118
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,486
I just enforce them.

119
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:33,754
I don't believe this, Joe.

120
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:34,889
This is like
living in Russia.

121
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:36,223
I might as well
just move there.

122
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,625
You don't want to do that.

123
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,594
It's dark; it's cold;
and hooking up

124
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:42,063
is just a crapshoot
'cause of all the big coats.

125
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,432
All right, drop
the coats on three.

126
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:46,400
One... two...

127
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:47,468
three!

128
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:48,769
Yeah!
Oh...

129
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:54,809
Hey, you ever
accidentally masturbate

130
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:56,510
to young pictures
of your mom?

131
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:58,613
Who the  starts
a conversation like that?

132
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,181
I just sat down.

133
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:01,616
Geez, what's
your problem, Peter?

134
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:03,084
I'm sorry, Quagmire.

135
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:05,086
I'm still just upset
about the damn government

136
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:06,587
sticking its nose
in my business.

137
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:07,822
I hear ya.

138
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,358
Wasting our tax dollars
on ridiculous causes.

139
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:11,943
We gotta protect
bald eagles?

140
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,978
Bald eagles should be allowed
to make their own decisions!

141
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:18,616
Honey, I don't care
that you're bald.

142
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,217
I find you
just as attractive.

143
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:21,602
It's not about you.

144
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,839
It's about my confidence
as an eagle architect.

145
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:26,273
<i>Just for Eagles will give you</i>

146
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:28,442
<i>thicker, fuller,</i>
<i>more natural hair...</i>

147
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,962
<i>so you can just focus</i>
<i>on eagle stuff.</i>

148
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,230
You're an
excellent architect.

149
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,500
Freakin' government.

150
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:38,069
Giving all the
good hoses to firemen.

151
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,437
I want them hoses.

152
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:40,871
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

153
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:42,239
And I'm Joyce Kinney.

154
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,710
Is it real
or just another excuse

155
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:47,778
for kids these days
to forget their manners?

156
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:49,814
But first, thousands
are expected

157
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,282
for tomorrow's
Tea Party rally

158
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,250
celebrating their new
Quahog headquarters.

159
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,485
That's right, Joyce.

160
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:56,320
The Tea Party has gained
a sizable following

161
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:58,155
based on their message
of low taxes,

162
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,391
limited government,
and happy birthday, Tom...

163
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:03,027
Oh, my God, you guys!

164
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,395
Tea Party, huh?

165
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:06,597
Well, I'd like to be
part of a movement,

166
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,066
but what movement would want
an angry fat guy

167
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:10,968
with a lot of opinions
who hates listening?

168
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:13,070
For more details
on the Tea Party platform,

169
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:16,007
we now go to this
totally boss fireworks show.

170
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:19,927
♪ ♪

171
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,282
Oh, my God! That's everything
I believe in!

172
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,758
Why are they trying
to take that away from us?

173
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:28,319
I hear ya.

174
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,470
Well, that's it.

175
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:31,238
I am going down
to that rally tomorrow

176
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:32,807
and I am joining
the Tea Party!

177
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:35,476
Oh, wait, that's the same time
as my men's knitting club,

178
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:37,545
although they have been
really critical lately.

179
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,383
You're still not knitting
honestly, Peter.

180
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:44,218
You're knitting like
you want us to like you.

181
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:45,686
It's not coming from inside.

182
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:47,388
It's very superficial.

183
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:49,657
Thank you!
You've made my decision easier!

184
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:51,425
Yes! That! Knit that!

185
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,346
Good Tea Party morning,
everyone!

186
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:01,847
Peter, you joined
the Tea Party?!

187
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:03,048
That's right, Brian.

188
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:04,483
I finally got something
better to do

189
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,118
with my Saturdays
than sit at the mall

190
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:09,088
and watch Japanese girls
laugh at normal conversation.

191
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:11,290
So, I drove to work
this morning...

192
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:14,493
And I had to stop
for coffee.

193
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:18,397
So, there's a Starbucks
near my house.

194
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:23,435
You people
are a circus.

195
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:25,487
Finally, I'm part of
a movement of regular people

196
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:27,322
trying to take back
our government.

197
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,624
Look, the Tea Party isn't

198
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:30,459
the grassroots movement
you think it is.

199
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:31,927
It's actually funded
by Big Business types

200
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:34,430
who are using you to get
the government out of their way

201
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:35,964
so they can roll over
everyone.

202
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:38,634
Mom held hands with a woman
at the gas station this morning.

203
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:41,403
Don't know what that means.
Just reporting it.

204
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:42,905
All I'm saying is
you're being used

205
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:44,306
and you're too clueless
to know it.

206
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:46,892
Boy, you just think
you're so superior, don't you?

207
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,428
Like that first creature
to walk on dry land.

208
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:52,281
Hey, where'd you go?

209
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,233
Ah, I went for a jog.
What's a jog?

210
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,819
It's a great way to stay
in shape is what it is.

211
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:58,320
Is it like a swim?

212
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:01,940
No, no, it's, it's
nothing like a swim.

213
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:07,596
Wow, a lot of people here today.

214
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:09,865
Yeah. Man,
I love street fairs.

215
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,200
They got rides, games,

216
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:14,052
and ethnic food cooked horribly
by white Americans.

217
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,305
Tack-os!
Hot tack-os here!

218
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:17,923
Oh, are those tack-os?

219
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:19,858
You better believe
they're tack-os.

220
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:21,493
I love tack-os!

221
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,195
Especially on a
corn tor-tilla.

222
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:27,065
Oh! I love tack-os
on a corn tor-tilla!

223
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:31,570
Boy, they're really
against socialism.

224
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:34,206
That's right. The Tea Party
is all about self-reliance.

225
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:35,991
Look, there's even
a Tunnel of Self-Love.

226
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:47,085
Would you like to buy a photo
of yourself on the ride, sir?

227
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:48,187
No, I would not.

228
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:49,655
Welcome, everyone!

229
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:52,691
It's great to see
so many regular people out here.

230
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,793
Folks who are tired
of big government

231
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:56,728
and are ready to stand up
for their rights.

232
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:58,630
Yeah!
Down with the Spend-o-crats!

233
00:08:58,698 --> 00:08:59,698
We are Marshall!

234
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:01,667
And now, it's my privilege

235
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:04,770
to introduce another regular,
blue-collar guy,

236
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:08,674
our Quahog chapter spokesman:
Joe Workingman!

237
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:15,397
Good afternoon, friends
and socioeconomic equals!

238
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:17,633
Is anyone else out there
sick of government crap?

239
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,268
Oh, my God.

240
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:21,670
It's like he's saying everything
I'm listening to.

241
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:23,038
That's right.

242
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:25,174
The government wants to tell you
what foods to eat.

243
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:28,293
And what church
you can go to.

244
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,897
And that you can't
own a chimpanzee

245
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:33,265
because you're not
responsible enough.

246
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:36,084
I would feed it!

247
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:37,986
Also, the government
wants to tell you

248
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:39,488
how many children
you can have.

249
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:41,456
What?! No!

250
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:42,958
And the government
wants to tell you

251
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:45,027
you can't throw
your old TVs into the river.

252
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:47,763
Then how I supposed
to find TV?

253
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:50,999
If you join the Tea Party,
together, we can fix all that.

254
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,135
But you probably don't wanna
join the Tea Party

255
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:58,357
because all you get are these
stupid, awesome keychains!

256
00:09:58,424 --> 00:10:01,326
Oh, my God, it's the keychain
from the dream!

257
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:07,015
I got to say that guy
made a lot of sense.

258
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,251
He sure did. The government's
really gotten outta hand.

259
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,453
Yeah, those bastards
have ruined everything.

260
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:13,856
The same way the Village People
ruined any gathering

261
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:16,258
of a cop, an Indian chief,
and a construction worker.

262
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:19,061
Oh, my God, can we get
a picture with you guys?

263
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,395
We're not those guys.

264
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:21,830
Yes, please
leave us alone.

265
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:23,765
We're very busy.

266
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,534
Now, where were we?
Oh, yeah.

267
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:27,536
We've gotta solve
that security problem

268
00:10:27,604 --> 00:10:29,805
for the Indian Casino
we're constructing.

269
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:31,206
Hey, you guys want
to head to the Clam?

270
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:33,191
I'll catch up with you.
I got to hit the john.

271
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:40,732
Hey, buddy. Is there
a bathroom around here,

272
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,150
or a second floor window?

273
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:44,570
Carter?!

274
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:46,088
Oh... hey.

275
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:47,656
You're involved
with the Tea Party?

276
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:48,924
Wait a minute.

277
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:50,559
This is what Brian
was warning me about:

278
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:52,327
that the Tea Party
is run by rich guys

279
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:53,695
who are only out for themselves.

280
00:10:53,763 --> 00:10:55,047
Brian?

281
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:57,199
You mean that arrogant,
unemployed dog of yours?

282
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:59,268
Peter, he's just one
of those liberal elites

283
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:01,003
who spreads lies
and hates patriots.

284
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,704
Yeah, he kinda is.

285
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:05,707
You and I are both businessmen
who work hard and pay taxes.

286
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:07,809
Except that I make
10,000 times what you make.

287
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:09,745
Yeah, we're the same,
you and me.

288
00:11:09,812 --> 00:11:11,113
You know, Peter, the truth is,

289
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,948
I could actually use
a regular guy like you

290
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:14,283
to help get our message out,

291
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,486
and I know
Joe Workingman agrees with me.

292
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,087
Love to have you
on board, Peter.

293
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:21,940
Wow, thanks, Joe.
You can count on me.

294
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:23,825
Aw, Carter, you just missed
Joe Workingman.

295
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:27,162
Oh, I think he'll
know I was here.

296
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:39,274
I'm not sure
what's happening.

297
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:44,146
Oh, hi, Peter.
How was your rally?

298
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:45,781
Oh, it was great,
and now I know

299
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:47,215
it's the right cause
to get behind

300
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:49,551
'cause a smart guy
like your dad is involved.

301
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:51,420
What, Carter was
at the Tea Party rally?

302
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:52,821
Yeah, he was running
the whole thing.

303
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,690
Peter, what did I tell you
about rich guys?

304
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,491
Look, I know what
you're thinking, Brian,

305
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,626
but don't worry;
it's all okay.

306
00:11:57,694 --> 00:11:58,994
Turns out
you're the enemy.

307
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:00,462
They're the ones
who are on our side.

308
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,030
Oh, of course,
Carter Pewterschmidt,

309
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:04,533
an industrialist with
oil refineries in this city,

310
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,934
is on your side.

311
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:07,469
He wants to get rid
of environmental regulations

312
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:08,637
for you.

313
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:09,972
Brian, he doesn't
get sarcasm.

314
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,074
No, it's not just environmental
regulations, Ban.

315
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:13,208
Carter wants
to get rid

316
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,344
of the whole city government
of Quahog.

317
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:18,046
He even put me in charge
of the PR campaign to do it.

318
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:19,581
Get rid of the government?

319
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,384
Peter, if I know my dad,
he's probably using you.

320
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,119
Lois, I'm so glad
you're done with the dishes

321
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:25,988
so that you can hang out
and chime in on this.

322
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:27,990
Actually, Peter, I
haven't done the dishes.

323
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,291
Oh, you haven't?

324
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,692
Well, then,
I'm confused.

325
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,561
Oh, he does get sarcasm.

326
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:37,032
All right,
now, remember,

327
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,767
the Tea Party is a
grassroots movement.

328
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:40,836
We're not covered by
the lame-stream media,

329
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,971
so we got to reach out to
the common man individually.

330
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,091
Right, common man.

331
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:47,676
Hello.

332
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:50,762
Ah, geez, it's... it's a girl.

333
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,614
May I speak to the man
of the house?

334
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:55,834
This is the woman of the house,
and there is no man living here.

335
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:57,369
No?

336
00:12:57,436 --> 00:13:00,188
W-W-What is... I-I... how are
you paying for this phone?

337
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:02,057
I'm a lawyer.

338
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,292
Oh, I see, and are you
in your little courthouse

339
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,861
right now
representing Barbie?

340
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,314
Okay, one vote
for the Tea Party.

341
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:11,116
All right, kiss
government good-bye.

342
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:13,785
Yeah, I can't wait to fire
all them city employees,

343
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:16,254
starting with that half-asleep
construction worker.

344
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:24,329
What the hell?

345
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:25,864
W-W-Which one is it--
stop or go forward?

346
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:26,848
This is a big deal.

347
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:27,833
They're not at all similar.

348
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,037
Ah, no, no, no, no.

349
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,939
You, sir, have lost my business.

350
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,569
People, please,
first things first.

351
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,672
Is there anyone here
for the couch off of Craigslist?

352
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,507
I am.

353
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:10,408
Oh, good, come on in.

354
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,481
That <i>is</i> the picture
from Craigslist.

355
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:17,482
No way it is.

356
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,483
It is.

357
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:21,119
No way it is.

358
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:23,038
All right, what do
the rest of you want?

359
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:25,173
We want the city government
shut down.

360
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,610
Oh, I see.

361
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:31,146
And all of you feel
the same way?

362
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:32,347
- Yes!
- No!

363
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:34,116
Yes!

364
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:36,718
Well, I'm nothing
if not a public servant,

365
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:38,920
and the public has made
its feelings known.

366
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:43,358
I hereby declare Quahog's
city government disbanded.

367
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:50,415
It has been my pleasure to serve
you, and now I take my leave.

368
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,718
This column is mine.

369
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:56,121
I brought it from home.

370
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:03,462
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

371
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,565
Our top story: Quahog is now
completely government-free,

372
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:09,868
which means I'm free
of all broadcast regulations,

373
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:12,237
so no more trips to the bathroom
for this reporter,

374
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:14,639
just a big-ass coffee can
under the desk.

375
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:21,363
Hello, family.

376
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:23,332
Peter, what the hell
were you doing out there?

377
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,734
You know, for years I've been
sick of taking the roads home,

378
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:27,302
so today I took the yards.

379
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,603
Didn't hit one light.

380
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:30,072
Man, getting rid
of the government has been

381
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,374
the best thing to happen
around here in a long time.

382
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:33,959
That's right.

383
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:36,028
Without government I'm free
to take a lot of mescaline

384
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:38,030
and drive to Vegas.

385
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,985
Wait till you see
Debbie Reynolds on stage.

386
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:45,771
Yeah, and now
my Spanish teacher and I

387
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:47,906
can finally hold hands
in the halls.

388
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:50,525
<i>¿Meg, dónde está</i>
<i>la biblioteca?</i>

389
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,345
Because I'm going to bang you
in the <i>biblioteca.</i>

390
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:55,080
Well, I'm glad you're all
enjoying your freedom,

391
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:56,948
but have you taken a look
out the window lately?

392
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:00,602
What is that?

393
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,237
Where's all that
smoke coming from?

394
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:04,406
The Pewterschmidt Industries
refinery,

395
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:07,109
and it's not smoke;
it's a giant cloud of pollution.

396
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,660
Oh, my God.

397
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:11,396
If that gets past the bad
neighborhoods and reaches us,

398
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:12,997
that's going to be
a big problem.

399
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:13,999
They can't do that.

400
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,167
We should report them.

401
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:16,518
To who?
There's no government.

402
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:19,471
Then it's up to us, the
people, to find a solution.

403
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:21,423
Close the curtains.

404
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:22,974
Ah, Tea Party.

405
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:25,577
Damn it, this is what I was
afraid was going to happen.

406
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:27,612
This town is going
to go to hell.

407
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,347
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

408
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:31,199
You may kiss
the bride.

409
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:34,703
I'm glad we waited.

410
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:42,294
Giraffity.

411
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:43,895
Yeah, see,
that's not mine.

412
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,231
Hey, Mort, what gives
with the blond hair?

413
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,066
Yeah, you look
weird like that.

414
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:50,969
Historically, in instances
of mass lawlessness,

415
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:54,423
the first thing they do
is round up the Jews.

416
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,209
Excuse me, fellow Aryan,
have you seen any Jews around?

417
00:16:57,276 --> 00:16:58,477
Is there a reward?

418
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:00,645
Wait a minute.
Are you Jewish?

419
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:03,815
I mean, uh,
unashamed locker room nudity.

420
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:05,150
This guy's kosher.

421
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:06,151
Oops.

422
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,385
Let's get him!

423
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:12,824
Good afternoon,
I'm Tom Tucker.

424
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,627
It's day five of the new
government-less Quahog,

425
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:17,529
and I'm wearing
a T-shirt.

426
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:19,531
Tom, I don't think
the government

427
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,966
was requiring you
to wear a suit.

428
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:23,468
Well, they were stopping me
from punching you in the face.

429
00:17:23,536 --> 00:17:24,669
Is that what you want?

430
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:25,904
No, you know what?
You know what?

431
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:27,122
Give me your wallet.
What?

432
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,924
You heard me,
I said give me your wallet.

433
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:31,743
This is a crappy wallet.

434
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,912
You have bad stuff.

435
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,963
Oh, what the hell?

436
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:37,115
Lois, the TV
went off again.

437
00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:38,717
It's the
electricity, Peter.

438
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:41,419
There are power lines down,
and there's no one to fix 'em.

439
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:43,488
The cops don't come,
the toilets don't flush,

440
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:45,957
and there's garbage
piling up in the streets.

441
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:48,460
Ryan Phillippe's been
out there for days.

442
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:50,629
Would anyone like
to be impregnated?

443
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,280
We had a nice town, Peter.

444
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:53,915
I had a nice life,

445
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:57,869
but you and your antigovernment
buddies ruined it.

446
00:17:57,937 --> 00:17:59,988
Hey, so how's that
Tea Party going, huh?

447
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:02,357
More like
T.P. Party.

448
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,459
Toilet paper.

449
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:05,861
I don't know
what happened, Brian.

450
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:07,896
Not having a government
worked great in Somalia,

451
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:09,865
but somehow we seem
to have botched it all up.

452
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:11,600
Looks that way.

453
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,298
Wait a minute. There might be
a way out of this.

454
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:14,019
What?

455
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,654
We just talk to the guy
who got us into this.

456
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,922
He'll know what to do.

457
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:32,020
Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

458
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,355
Go away.

459
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:35,724
But, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
you got to do something.

460
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,692
The potholes ain't
getting fixed no more.

461
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,594
The stoplights ain't working.

462
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:42,297
Tampon commercials
no longer use blue liquids

463
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:43,765
in their demonstrations.

464
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:47,969
Make it blue.
That's always been the deal!

465
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:50,505
You show whatever you want,
but you make it blue!

466
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:51,673
Come on.
You got to help us out.

467
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:52,874
Go to hell.

468
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:54,342
I don't think he's going
to help, Peter.

469
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,711
But if rich people aren't
looking out for us, who is?

470
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,680
Well, maybe we need
to look out for each other.

471
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:01,583
Come on, Brian.
It's time to make this right.

472
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:05,136
Wait, before you go,
take two steps to the left.

473
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,121
Look up.

474
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,373
Okay, smile.

475
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:09,841
Aw, I suck.

476
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:21,937
People of Quahog,
I have something to say.

477
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:23,538
Now that we've
freed ourselves

478
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:25,407
from the terrible
shackles of government,

479
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:27,742
it's time to replace it
with something better.

480
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,914
The first thing we need
is a system of rules

481
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:34,583
that everyone
must live by.

482
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:37,802
Got to have rules.

483
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,738
And since we can't spend
all our time making rules,

484
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,641
I think that we should elect
some people to represent us,

485
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,527
and they should make rules
and choices on our behalf.

486
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,547
That's probably a good idea.

487
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:52,300
Now, this may be kind of
expensive, so I got a plan:

488
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:53,768
everyone should have
to give some money

489
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:55,604
from their salaries
each year.

490
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:57,472
Poor people will give
a little bit of money

491
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,474
and rich people will give
a larger amount of money,

492
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,910
and our representatives
will use all that money

493
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:03,912
to hire some people
who will then provide us

494
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,981
with social order
and basic services.

495
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:13,254
Ugh, there's not one shirt
I wish I had out there.

496
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:14,756
Now, it won't be perfect.

497
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:17,508
Some of our representatives
may end up being bastards.

498
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,144
But you know what?
That's okay

499
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:20,812
'cause later we're going to have
more elections,

500
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,365
and we can use those elections
to get rid of the bad guys

501
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:24,783
and replace 'em with good guys,

502
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,935
and then the system
will just keep going on and on

503
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:28,036
just like that.

504
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:30,388
So who's with me?

505
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:36,077
Will you join me
in trying this new crazy thing?

506
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,149
Then let's do it.

507
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,364
Yeah, and we did it all
without government.

508
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,183
I'm very proud
of you, Peter.

509
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:52,187
Oh, Lois, that means
nothing to me.

510
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,811
I only care what they say on
the Internet message boards.
