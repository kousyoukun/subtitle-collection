12
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:41,657
Wow, congratulations on your
grand re-opening, Mort.

13
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:43,642
Looks like your customers
are comin' back.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,795
Thanks, Lois. It's good
to be up and gouging again.

15
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,714
Oh, careful.
Watch out there, Brian.

16
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:49,982
Looks like the floor is wet.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,684
Excuse me.
I'm kind of in a hurry

18
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,652
(screams)
Son of a bitch!

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,254
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

20
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,773
I'm sorry. I've been
a little distracted lately.

21
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,675
I think my wife has
been crossing the street

22
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:00,876
with another man.

23
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,146
God, I hope Alan
doesn't find out.

24
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,748
Hey, forget that klutz.

25
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,153
Hmm, maybe this one.

26
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:13,489
Hey. Lookin' at you
pretty normal, huh?

27
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:15,190
No!

28
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:16,275
Aw, fudge.

29
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,509
Wait, I know!

30
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,647
I'll figure this out.

31
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,515
Th-the pieces are all there.

32
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,850
I-I'll go home
and figure this out.

33
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:29,004
Aw, cool. Hey Mort,
what's this thing?

34
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:31,607
Oh, that? That's my
"Come In! We're Open" sign.

35
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,925
What's that,
like an iPad?

36
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,410
No, it's a sign.

37
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:35,894
Wish I had one of those.

38
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,346
I've got a whole box
of them.

39
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:39,148
Take it. It's yours.
No charge.

40
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:41,350
Ugh, typical Jew.

41
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:46,688
TV ANNOUNCER:
Coming this fall

42
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:48,357
from the producers
of <i>Gone Baby</i> <i>Gone,</i>

43
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:50,325
comes the riveting sequel:

44
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:52,995
<i>Gone Severely Disabled</i>
<i>Baby Gone.</i>

45
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:55,697
I promise you we are going
to find your daughter.

46
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, but, you know,
do-do what you can,

47
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,868
but seriously, don't,
like, kill yourself.

48
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:02,571
Oh, and if you do find her,
honk this horn a couple times.

49
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,807
It's the only way to get her
to stop biting you.

50
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,475
But again, no rush.

51
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,877
(knocking)

52
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:11,930
Peter, what
are you doing?

53
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,649
I'm just putting up
my new sign.

54
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,017
Don't put that thing
on our door.

55
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:16,168
If you want to hang it
somewhere,

56
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,719
hang it in the basement.

57
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:19,988
Oh, why? So you can hog it
while you're doing laundry?

58
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,723
No way.
Peter, we're not a business.

59
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,959
Hey, I saw your sign.
So, you're open?

60
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:25,427
That's right.
What do you do?

61
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:26,662
What do you need?
Milk.

62
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,063
We have milk.

63
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,305
Peter, I told you,
I don't like

64
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,574
all these strangers
walking around in our house.

65
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,443
They're not strangers, Lois;
they are our valued customers.

66
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,745
And if we don't show them
we appreciate their loyalty,

67
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:45,947
they're gonna go someplace else.
For what?!

68
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,216
Not to alarm anyone,

69
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:48,717
but some guy took me
in the closet

70
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:49,985
and tried me on.

71
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,521
She's right, Dad.
None of this makes any sense.

72
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,889
Meg, go take your ten.

73
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:55,624
And you may consider this
a verbal warning.

74
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,392
Peter, I want
these people to leave.

75
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,727
I fit,
by the way.

76
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,262
Lois, I'd love nothing more

77
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,430
than to sit here
and chat with you,

78
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,031
but I have a business to run.

79
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,683
Hi there.
May I help you folks?

80
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,985
Yes, my family and I would like
our portrait painted.

81
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,554
Well, you came
to the right place.

82
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,828
Looking good.

83
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,196
Almost done.

84
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,198
And... there.

85
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,449
Done.

86
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,002
What have you done?!

87
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,804
I painted the truth.

88
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,506
I painted my truth.

89
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,595
Gimme a spin, sweetie.

90
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:34,880
What do you think, Mom?

91
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,082
Is that the most beautiful
bride you've ever seen?

92
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,183
I love it!

93
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,618
Oh, it's just
so much money.

94
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,336
It's true. It's true.

95
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,454
Take the dress off,
sweetheart.

96
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,956
Your mother says
you can't have it.

97
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,224
W-wait, wait,
wait a minute.

98
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,475
Do you really love it?

99
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:49,027
I do. It just feels
like my wedding dress.

100
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,463
Oh, Mom, she loves it.

101
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,998
Okay.
We'll take it.

102
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,201
Peter, what is that girl doing
in my wedding dress?!

103
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:58,186
PETER: She gone?
No.

104
00:03:58,254 --> 00:03:59,388
Okay, well, while
I'm down here

105
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:00,956
let me give you my card.

106
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:02,491
There you go.

107
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:08,931
Here you go. A half pound of
honey maple turkey, sliced thin.

108
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,599
I wanted a
duplicate key made.

109
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,033
You have a good one.

110
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,318
Oh, hey, Joe.
What's going on?

111
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,121
Peter, I'm afraid
I'm here to shut you down.

112
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,956
You're running an
unlicensed business,

113
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,291
and that's against the law.

114
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,893
Aw, that is such bullcrap.

115
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,644
Well, you can't fight
City Hall.

116
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:24,479
Oh, we'll see about that!

117
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,784
City Hall knows karate.

118
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,353
I'm sorry, Peter, but the
government makes the rules.

119
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,487
I just enforce them.

120
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:33,755
I don't believe this, Joe.

121
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:34,890
This is like
living in Russia.

122
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,224
I might as well
just move there.

123
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:37,626
You don't want to do that.

124
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,595
It's dark; it's cold;
and hooking up

125
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:42,064
is just a crapshoot
'cause of all the big coats.

126
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,433
All right, drop
the coats on three.

127
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,401
One... two...

128
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:47,469
three!

129
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,770
Yeah!
Oh...

130
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:54,810
Hey, you ever
accidentally masturbate

131
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,511
to young pictures
of your mom?

132
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,614
Who the (bleep) starts
a conversation like that?

133
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,182
I just sat down.

134
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,617
Geez, what's
your problem, Peter?

135
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,085
I'm sorry, Quagmire.

136
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:05,087
I'm still just upset
about the damn government

137
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:06,588
sticking its nose
in my business.

138
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:07,823
I hear ya.

139
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,359
Wasting our tax dollars
on ridiculous causes.

140
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:11,944
We gotta protect
bald eagles?

141
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,979
Bald eagles should be allowed
to make their own decisions!

142
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,617
Honey, I don't care
that you're bald.

143
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,218
I find you
just as attractive.

144
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,603
It's not about you.

145
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:24,840
It's about my confidence
as an eagle architect.

146
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,274
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Just for Eagles will give you</i>

147
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:28,443
<i>thicker, fuller,</i>
<i>more natural hair...</i>

148
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,963
<i>so you can just focus</i>
<i>on eagle stuff.</i>

149
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,231
You're an
excellent architect.

150
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,501
Freakin' government.

151
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,070
Giving all the
good hoses to firemen.

152
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,438
I want them hoses.

153
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,872
ANCHORMAN:
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

154
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,240
And I'm Joyce Kinney.

155
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,809
Coming up: Autism:

156
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,711
Is it real
or just another excuse

157
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,779
for kids these days
to forget their manners?

158
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,815
But first, thousands
are expected

159
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,283
for tomorrow's
Tea Party rally

160
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,251
celebrating their new
Quahog headquarters.

161
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,486
That's right, Joyce.

162
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,321
The Tea Party has gained
a sizable following

163
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,156
based on their message
of low taxes,

164
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,392
limited government,
and happy birthday, Tom...

165
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,028
Oh, my God, you guys!

166
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,396
Tea Party, huh?

167
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,598
Well, I'd like to be
part of a movement,

168
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,067
but what movement would want
an angry fat guy

169
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,969
with a lot of opinions
who hates listening?

170
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,071
For more details
on the Tea Party platform,

171
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,008
we now go to this
totally boss fireworks show.

172
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:19,928
♪ ♪

173
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,283
Oh, my God! That's everything
I believe in!

174
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,759
Why are they trying
to take that away from us?

175
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:28,320
I hear ya.

176
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,471
Well, that's it.

177
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,239
I am going down
to that rally tomorrow

178
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,808
and I am joining
the Tea Party!

179
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,477
Oh, wait, that's the same time
as my men's knitting club,

180
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:37,546
although they have been
really critical lately.

181
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,384
You're still not knitting
honestly, Peter.

182
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,219
You're knitting like
you want us to like you.

183
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:45,687
It's not coming from inside.

184
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:47,389
It's very superficial.

185
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:49,658
Thank you!
You've made my decision easier!

186
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,426
Yes! That! Knit that!

187
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:00,347
Good Tea Party morning,
everyone!

188
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:01,848
Peter, you joined
the Tea Party?!

189
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,049
That's right, Brian.

190
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:04,484
I finally got something
better to do

191
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:06,119
with my Saturdays
than sit at the mall

192
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:09,089
and watch Japanese girls
laugh at normal conversation.

193
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:11,291
So, I drove to work
this morning...

194
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,026
(all giggling)

195
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:14,494
And I had to stop
for coffee.

196
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:16,262
(all giggling)

197
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,398
So, there's a Starbucks
near my house.

198
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:21,768
(all laughing)

199
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:23,436
You people
are a circus.

200
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:25,488
Finally, I'm part of
a movement of regular people

201
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:27,323
trying to take back
our government.

202
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:28,625
Look, the Tea Party isn't

203
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:30,460
the grassroots movement
you think it is.

204
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:31,928
It's actually funded
by Big Business types

205
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:34,431
who are using you to get
the government out of their way

206
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:35,965
so they can roll over
everyone.

207
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,635
Mom held hands with a woman
at the gas station this morning.

208
00:07:38,703 --> 00:07:41,404
Don't know what that means.
Just reporting it.

209
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:42,906
All I'm saying is
you're being used

210
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:44,307
and you're too clueless
to know it.

211
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:46,893
Boy, you just think
you're so superior, don't you?

212
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,429
Like that first creature
to walk on dry land.

213
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:52,282
Hey, where'd you go?

214
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:54,234
Ah, I went for a jog.
What's a jog?

215
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,820
It's a great way to stay
in shape is what it is.

216
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:58,321
Is it like a swim?

217
00:07:58,406 --> 00:07:59,806
(laughing condescendingly)

218
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:01,941
No, no, it's, it's
nothing like a swim.

219
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:07,597
Wow, a lot of people here today.

220
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:09,866
Yeah. Man,
I love street fairs.

221
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:11,201
They got rides, games,

222
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:14,053
and ethnic food cooked horribly
by white Americans.

223
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,306
Tack-os!
Hot tack-os here!

224
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:17,924
Oh, are those tack-os?

225
00:08:17,992 --> 00:08:19,859
You better believe
they're tack-os.

226
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:21,494
I love tack-os!

227
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:23,196
Especially on a
corn tor-tilla.

228
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:27,066
Oh! I love tack-os
on a corn tor-tilla!

229
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,571
Boy, they're really
against socialism.

230
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,207
That's right. The Tea Party
is all about self-reliance.

231
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:35,992
Look, there's even
a Tunnel of Self-Love.

232
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:47,086
Would you like to buy a photo
of yourself on the ride, sir?

233
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:48,188
No, I would not.

234
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:49,656
Welcome, everyone!

235
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:52,692
It's great to see
so many regular people out here.

236
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,794
Folks who are tired
of big government

237
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:56,729
and are ready to stand up
for their rights.

238
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,631
Yeah!
Down with the Spend-o-crats!

239
00:08:58,699 --> 00:08:59,699
PETER:
We are Marshall!

240
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,668
And now, it's my privilege

241
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:04,771
to introduce another regular,
blue-collar guy,

242
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,675
our Quahog chapter spokesman:
Joe Workingman!

243
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:09,993
(cheering and applause)

244
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:15,398
Good afternoon, friends
and socioeconomic equals!

245
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,634
Is anyone else out there
sick of government crap?

246
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:19,269
Oh, my God.

247
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,671
It's like he's saying everything
I'm listening to.

248
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:23,039
That's right.

249
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:25,175
The government wants to tell you
what foods to eat.

250
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:26,659
(booing)

251
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,294
And what church
you can go to.

252
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:29,946
(booing)

253
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,898
And that you can't
own a chimpanzee

254
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:33,266
because you're not
responsible enough.

255
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:34,851
(booing)

256
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,085
I would feed it!

257
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:37,987
Also, the government
wants to tell you

258
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:39,489
how many children
you can have.

259
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:41,457
What?! No!

260
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:42,959
And the government
wants to tell you

261
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:45,028
you can't throw
your old TVs into the river.

262
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:47,764
Then how I supposed
to find TV?

263
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:51,000
If you join the Tea Party,
together, we can fix all that.

264
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:53,136
But you probably don't wanna
join the Tea Party

265
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:58,358
because all you get are these
stupid, awesome keychains!

266
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:01,327
Oh, my God, it's the keychain
from the dream!

267
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:07,016
I got to say that guy
made a lot of sense.

268
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,252
He sure did. The government's
really gotten outta hand.

269
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,454
Yeah, those bastards
have ruined everything.

270
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,857
The same way the Village People
ruined any gathering

271
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:16,259
of a cop, an Indian chief,
and a construction worker.

272
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:19,062
Oh, my God, can we get
a picture with you guys?

273
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:20,396
We're not those guys.

274
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:21,831
Yes, please
leave us alone.

275
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,766
We're very busy.

276
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,535
Now, where were we?
Oh, yeah.

277
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:27,537
We've gotta solve
that security problem

278
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:29,806
for the Indian Casino
we're constructing.

279
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:31,207
Hey, you guys want
to head to the Clam?

280
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,192
I'll catch up with you.
I got to hit the john.

281
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,733
Hey, buddy. Is there
a bathroom around here,

282
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:42,151
or a second floor window?

283
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,571
(gasps)
Carter?!

284
00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:46,089
Oh... hey.

285
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:47,657
You're involved
with the Tea Party?

286
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:48,925
Wait a minute.

287
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:50,560
This is what Brian
was warning me about:

288
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,328
that the Tea Party
is run by rich guys

289
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:53,696
who are only out for themselves.

290
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:55,048
Brian?

291
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:57,200
You mean that arrogant,
unemployed dog of yours?

292
00:10:57,268 --> 00:10:59,269
Peter, he's just one
of those liberal elites

293
00:10:59,336 --> 00:11:01,004
who spreads lies
and hates patriots.

294
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:02,705
Yeah, he kinda is.

295
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:05,708
You and I are both businessmen
who work hard and pay taxes.

296
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:07,810
Except that I make
10,000 times what you make.

297
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:09,746
Yeah, we're the same,
you and me.

298
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,114
You know, Peter, the truth is,

299
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:12,949
I could actually use
a regular guy like you

300
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:14,284
to help get our message out,

301
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:17,487
and I know
Joe Workingman agrees with me.

302
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:19,088
Love to have you
on board, Peter.

303
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:21,941
Wow, thanks, Joe.
You can count on me.

304
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:23,826
Aw, Carter, you just missed
Joe Workingman.

305
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:25,061
(laughs)

306
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,163
Oh, I think he'll
know I was here.

307
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:30,182
(laughing)

308
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:31,534
(laughing maniacally)

309
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:34,153
(chuckling nervously)

310
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,275
I'm not sure
what's happening.

311
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:44,147
Oh, hi, Peter.
How was your rally?

312
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:45,782
Oh, it was great,
and now I know

313
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:47,216
it's the right cause
to get behind

314
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:49,552
'cause a smart guy
like your dad is involved.

315
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,421
What, Carter was
at the Tea Party rally?

316
00:11:51,488 --> 00:11:52,822
Yeah, he was running
the whole thing.

317
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,691
Peter, what did I tell you
about rich guys?

318
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:56,492
Look, I know what
you're thinking, Brian,

319
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,627
but don't worry;
it's all okay.

320
00:11:57,695 --> 00:11:58,995
Turns out
you're the enemy.

321
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:00,463
They're the ones
who are on our side.

322
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:02,031
Oh, of course,
Carter Pewterschmidt,

323
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,534
an industrialist with
oil refineries in this city,

324
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,935
is on your side.

325
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:07,470
He wants to get rid
of environmental regulations

326
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:08,638
for you.

327
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:09,973
Brian, he doesn't
get sarcasm.

328
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,075
No, it's not just environmental
regulations, Ban.

329
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:13,209
Carter wants
to get rid

330
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:15,345
of the whole city government
of Quahog.

331
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:18,047
He even put me in charge
of the PR campaign to do it.

332
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:19,582
Get rid of the government?

333
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,385
Peter, if I know my dad,
he's probably using you.

334
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:24,120
Lois, I'm so glad
you're done with the dishes

335
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:25,989
so that you can hang out
and chime in on this.

336
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:27,991
Actually, Peter, I
haven't done the dishes.

337
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:29,292
Oh, you haven't?

338
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,693
Well, then,
I'm confused.

339
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:32,562
Oh, he does get sarcasm.

340
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:37,033
All right,
now, remember,

341
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:38,768
the Tea Party is a
grassroots movement.

342
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,837
We're not covered by
the lame-stream media,

343
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:42,972
so we got to reach out to
the common man individually.

344
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,092
Right, common man.

345
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:47,677
WOMAN:
Hello.

346
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:50,763
Ah, geez, it's... it's a girl.

347
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:52,615
May I speak to the man
of the house?

348
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,835
This is the woman of the house,
and there is no man living here.

349
00:12:55,903 --> 00:12:57,370
No?

350
00:12:57,437 --> 00:13:00,189
W-W-What is... I-I... how are
you paying for this phone?

351
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:02,058
I'm a lawyer.

352
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:04,293
Oh, I see, and are you
in your little courthouse

353
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:05,862
right now
representing Barbie?

354
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,230
(click, dial tone)

355
00:13:07,297 --> 00:13:09,315
Okay, one vote
for the Tea Party.

356
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:11,117
All right, kiss
government good-bye.

357
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:13,786
Yeah, I can't wait to fire
all them city employees,

358
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:16,255
starting with that half-asleep
construction worker.

359
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,330
What the hell?

360
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:25,865
W-W-Which one is it--
stop or go forward?

361
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:26,849
This is a big deal.

362
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:27,834
They're not at all similar.

363
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:32,038
Ah, no, no, no, no.

364
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:33,940
You, sir, have lost my business.

365
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,112
("Yankee Doodle Dandy" playing)

366
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:02,051
(crowd jeering)

367
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:04,570
People, please,
first things first.

368
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:07,673
Is there anyone here
for the couch off of Craigslist?

369
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:08,508
I am.

370
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:10,409
Oh, good, come on in.

371
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:16,482
That <i>is</i> the picture
from Craigslist.

372
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,483
No way it is.

373
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:18,484
It is.

374
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:21,120
No way it is.

375
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:23,039
All right, what do
the rest of you want?

376
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:25,174
We want the city government
shut down.

377
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:27,193
(cheering)

378
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:28,611
Oh, I see.

379
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,147
And all of you feel
the same way?

380
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:32,348
ALL: Yes!
MAN: No!

381
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,117
(gunshot)
ALL: Yes!

382
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:36,719
Well, I'm nothing
if not a public servant,

383
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:38,921
and the public has made
its feelings known.

384
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:43,359
I hereby declare Quahog's
city government disbanded.

385
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:45,611
(cheering)

386
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,416
It has been my pleasure to serve
you, and now I take my leave.

387
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:53,719
This column is mine.

388
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:56,122
I brought it from home.

389
00:15:01,962 --> 00:15:03,463
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

390
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,566
Our top story: Quahog is now
completely government-free,

391
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:09,869
which means I'm free
of all broadcast regulations,

392
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:12,238
so no more trips to the bathroom
for this reporter,

393
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:14,640
just a big-ass coffee can
under the desk.

394
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:21,364
Hello, family.

395
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:23,333
Peter, what the hell
were you doing out there?

396
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,735
You know, for years I've been
sick of taking the roads home,

397
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:27,303
so today I took the yards.

398
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:28,604
Didn't hit one light.

399
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:30,073
Man, getting rid
of the government has been

400
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,375
the best thing to happen
around here in a long time.

401
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:33,960
That's right.

402
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:36,029
Without government I'm free
to take a lot of mescaline

403
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:38,031
and drive to Vegas.

404
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,986
Wait till you see
Debbie Reynolds on stage.

405
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:45,772
Yeah, and now
my Spanish teacher and I

406
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,907
can finally hold hands
in the halls.

407
00:15:47,975 --> 00:15:50,526
<i>¿Meg, dónde está</i>
<i>la biblioteca?</i>

408
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:53,346
Because I'm going to bang you
in the <i>biblioteca.</i>

409
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:55,081
Well, I'm glad you're all
enjoying your freedom,

410
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:56,949
but have you taken a look
out the window lately?

411
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:00,603
What is that?

412
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:02,238
Where's all that
smoke coming from?

413
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:04,407
The Pewterschmidt Industries
refinery,

414
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:07,110
and it's not smoke;
it's a giant cloud of pollution.

415
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:08,661
Oh, my God.

416
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:11,397
If that gets past the bad
neighborhoods and reaches us,

417
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:12,998
that's going to be
a big problem.

418
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,000
They can't do that.

419
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:15,168
We should report them.

420
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:16,519
To who?
There's no government.

421
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:19,472
Then it's up to us, the
people, to find a solution.

422
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,424
Close the curtains.

423
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:22,975
Ah, Tea Party.

424
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:25,578
Damn it, this is what I was
afraid was going to happen.

425
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:27,613
This town is going
to go to hell.

426
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,348
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

427
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,200
You may kiss
the bride.

428
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:34,704
I'm glad we waited.

429
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,207
(bleating)

430
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:42,295
Giraffity.

431
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:43,896
Yeah, see,
that's not mine.

432
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:46,232
Hey, Mort, what gives
with the blond hair?

433
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,067
Yeah, you look
weird like that.

434
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:50,970
Historically, in instances
of mass lawlessness,

435
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:54,424
the first thing they do
is round up the Jews.

436
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:57,210
Excuse me, fellow Aryan,
have you seen any Jews around?

437
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:58,478
Is there a reward?

438
00:16:58,545 --> 00:17:00,646
Wait a minute.
Are you Jewish?

439
00:17:00,714 --> 00:17:03,816
I mean, uh,
unashamed locker room nudity.

440
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:05,151
This guy's kosher.

441
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:06,152
Oops.

442
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,386
Let's get him!

443
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,825
Good afternoon,
I'm Tom Tucker.

444
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:15,628
It's day five of the new
government-less Quahog,

445
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:17,530
and I'm wearing
a T-shirt.

446
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:19,532
Tom, I don't think
the government

447
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,967
was requiring you
to wear a suit.

448
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:23,469
Well, they were stopping me
from punching you in the face.

449
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:24,670
Is that what you want?

450
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:25,905
No, you know what?
You know what?

451
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:27,123
Give me your wallet.
What?

452
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:28,925
You heard me,
I said give me your wallet.

453
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:31,744
This is a crappy wallet.

454
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,913
You have bad stuff.

455
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:34,964
Oh, what the hell?

456
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:37,116
Lois, the TV
went off again.

457
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:38,718
It's the
electricity, Peter.

458
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,420
There are power lines down,
and there's no one to fix 'em.

459
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:43,489
The cops don't come,
the toilets don't flush,

460
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:45,958
and there's garbage
piling up in the streets.

461
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:48,461
Ryan Phillippe's been
out there for days.

462
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:50,630
Would anyone like
to be impregnated?

463
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:52,281
We had a nice town, Peter.

464
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:53,916
I had a nice life,

465
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:57,870
but you and your antigovernment
buddies ruined it.

466
00:17:57,938 --> 00:17:59,989
Hey, so how's that
Tea Party going, huh?

467
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:02,358
More like
T.P. Party.

468
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:04,460
Toilet paper.

469
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:05,862
I don't know
what happened, Brian.

470
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:07,897
Not having a government
worked great in Somalia,

471
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:09,866
but somehow we seem
to have botched it all up.

472
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,601
Looks that way.

473
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,299
Wait a minute. There might be
a way out of this.

474
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:14,020
What?

475
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:15,655
We just talk to the guy
who got us into this.

476
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:16,923
He'll know what to do.

477
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:32,021
Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

478
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:33,356
CARTER (over intercom):
Go away.

479
00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:35,725
But, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
you got to do something.

480
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,693
The potholes ain't
getting fixed no more.

481
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,595
The stoplights ain't working.

482
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:42,298
Tampon commercials
no longer use blue liquids

483
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:43,766
in their demonstrations.

484
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,935
(all groan)

485
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:47,970
Make it blue.
That's always been the deal!

486
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:50,506
You show whatever you want,
but you make it blue!

487
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:51,674
Come on.
You got to help us out.

488
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:52,875
Go to hell.

489
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:54,343
I don't think he's going
to help, Peter.

490
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:56,712
But if rich people aren't
looking out for us, who is?

491
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,681
Well, maybe we need
to look out for each other.

492
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:01,584
Come on, Brian.
It's time to make this right.

493
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:05,137
Wait, before you go,
take two steps to the left.

494
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:06,122
Look up.

495
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:08,374
Okay, smile.

496
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:09,842
Aw, I suck.

497
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,978
(indistinct shouting)

498
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:21,938
People of Quahog,
I have something to say.

499
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:23,539
Now that we've
freed ourselves

500
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:25,408
from the terrible
shackles of government,

501
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:27,743
it's time to replace it
with something better.

502
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:30,413
(all grumbling)

503
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,915
The first thing we need
is a system of rules

504
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:34,584
that everyone
must live by.

505
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:36,369
(all grumbling)

506
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:37,803
Got to have rules.

507
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:39,739
And since we can't spend
all our time making rules,

508
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:42,642
I think that we should elect
some people to represent us,

509
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:45,528
and they should make rules
and choices on our behalf.

510
00:19:45,596 --> 00:19:46,729
(all murmuring in agreement)

511
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:49,548
That's probably a good idea.

512
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:52,301
Now, this may be kind of
expensive, so I got a plan:

513
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:53,769
everyone should have
to give some money

514
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:55,605
from their salaries
each year.

515
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,473
Poor people will give
a little bit of money

516
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,475
and rich people will give
a larger amount of money,

517
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,911
and our representatives
will use all that money

518
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:03,913
to hire some people
who will then provide us

519
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:05,982
with social order
and basic services.

520
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,533
(cheering and applause)

521
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:13,255
Ugh, there's not one shirt
I wish I had out there.

522
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:14,757
Now, it won't be perfect.

523
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:17,509
Some of our representatives
may end up being bastards.

524
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:19,145
But you know what?
That's okay

525
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,813
'cause later we're going to have
more elections,

526
00:20:20,864 --> 00:20:23,366
and we can use those elections
to get rid of the bad guys

527
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,784
and replace 'em with good guys,

528
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:26,936
and then the system
will just keep going on and on

529
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:28,037
just like that.

530
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,271
(cheering and applause)

531
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:30,389
So who's with me?

532
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:33,359
(cheering)

533
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:36,078
Will you join me
in trying this new crazy thing?

534
00:20:36,146 --> 00:20:37,997
(cheering)

535
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,150
Then let's do it.

536
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:45,136
(cheering)

537
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,365
Yeah, and we did it all
without government.

538
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:49,184
I'm very proud
of you, Peter.

539
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:52,188
Oh, Lois, that means
nothing to me.

540
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:54,812
I only care what they say on
the Internet message boards.

541
