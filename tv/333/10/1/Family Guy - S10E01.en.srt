200,000 lottery tickets,

156
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,512
you had 400,000 fake ones printed up?

157
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,180
I had to be sure.

158
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,434
Oh, my God. We won!

159
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,061
-What?
-Let me see that.

160
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,105
Yes! We won the lottery!

161
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,607
I'm getting a penis butler.

162
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,691
Sir?

163
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,027
All right, butle my penis. Butle it!

164
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,326
This is awesome. Now that we're rich,

165
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,036
our lives are going to be so much better.

166
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,788
You sure it was such a good idea

167
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,331
to cash that lottery check?

168
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,917
It seems foolish to have
all this money lying around.

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,335
Oh, you'd rather have it down at the bank

170
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,045
where the Jewish guys can leer at it?

171
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,755
-Yeah!
-All right!

172
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,090
-Money!

-No, Daddy.

176

<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

178
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,058
All right, so how are we
going to spend our winnings?

179
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,018
I'm going to get some
supermarket fried chicken

180
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,728
and eat it until I'm nauseous.

181
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,565
I'm going to finally get my gal
that doodad she's been wantin'!

182
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,650
I'm going to get a floor mirror
to squat over

183
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,569
and see what's making all that noise.

184
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,571
Okay, everybody just calm down.

185
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,573
We're not going to go crazy
spending our winnings,

186
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,491
and we're not going to let
this money change us.

187
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:33,370
What are you talking about? This money is
our ticket to the good life, starting now.

188
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,914
I just bought a giant room
full of gold coins,

189
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,166
and I'm going to dive into it
like Scrooge McDuck.

(DRUMROLL)

191

Aah! It's not a liquid!

192
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,345
It's a great many pieces of solid matter
that form a hard, floor-like surface!

193
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,889
Aah!

194
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,563
Peter, what are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

195
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,939
I quit my job, Lois.

196
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,733
-You what?
-Yeah, we're rich now.

197
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,402
I don't need to be working.
Ah, you should've been there, Lois.

198
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,404
I told Angela what she could do
with that job,

199
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,364
just like I always fantasized.

200
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:13,285
Angela, I just want to thank you
for several extremely pleasurable years

201
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,037
working for this corporation.

202
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,332
Uh, certain unexpected developments
have created a situation

203
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,584
where I am no longer
in need of employment.

204
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,796
Uh, I would be remiss, however,
if I did not extend my gratitude to you

205
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,424
for your unwavering
fairness and belief in me,

206
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,510
and there is a giant poo on your desk.

207

(ALL CHEERING)

209
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,020
Gosh, Peter, you're really
being generous with your money.

210
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,355
Hey, what's the point of being rich

211
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,232
if you can't share it with your pals, huh?

212
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,566
Okay, wait, I-I got one.

213
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,776
Who would you rather do?

214
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,571
Susan Boyle or a sex doll
that's been passed around a fraternity?

215
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,156
Well, have they been cleaning the doll?

216
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,283
Please, these guys are Betas,
they're total animals.

217
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,494
Hey, I got one, Peter.
What would you rather do?

218
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,122
Tread water where you are right now
or increase your net worth fivefold

219
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,624
within the next 18 months?

220
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,293
Huh? What? I...
What are you talking about?

221
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,337
Well, my friend Marty
is a whiz with chemistry,

222
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,465
and he says he's come up
with a new penis enlargement pill,

223
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,468
and if we can bankroll him
$100,000 in start-up money,

224
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,387
he'll triple our investment in a year.

225
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,139
Well, uh... gee, I-I'm... I don't, uh...

226
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,434
Peter, I've taken the liberty
of mocking up some sales projections.

227
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,894
Wow, that's pretty good.

228
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,896
And this would be our net profits.

229
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,064
Yikes.

230
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,816
You know, Peter, uh,

231
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,777
Bonnie's birthday is coming up,
and I'll be gol-darned

232

if I didn't go ahead and promise her
that Stevie Nicks

233
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,700
would come to our house
and sing three songs to her.

your mouth with the missus,

00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,665

So what do say, Peter?
Can you help us out?

Of course I can, you dope.

three shots of your best bourbon.

00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,708
Okay, Quagmire, I want you
to take the first bite

309
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,834
out of this fudge pop,

310
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,545
because that first bite
is the one that really hurts.

311
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,088
Well, okay.

312
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,091
(GRUNTING)

313
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,720
Ah! Ow!

314
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,805
-Ow!
-Yeah, that's right "Ow."

315
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,016
Now, you swallow that.
Don't you dare spit that out.

316
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,768
What's the difference?
You got what you wanted.

317
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,853
-I said swallow it!
-(GULPING)

318
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,730
Now, smear what's left of it on your face

319
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,190
and look at me with your mouth open.

320
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,070
Look at yourself, you filthy whore.

321
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,491
I don't even want this now.

322
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,248
Okay, guys, now you're gonna do
a synchronized duet

323
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,959
of "Makin' Whoopee" while
I shoot you with this BB gun.

324
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,126
That doesn't sound safe.

325
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,087
-Action!
-(PIANO PLAYING)

326
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,089
<i>-Another bride</i>
<i>-She looks so gay</i>

327
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,715
<i>-Another June</i>
<i>-Oh, what a day</i>

328
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,593
<i>Another sunny honeymoon</i>

00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:22,928

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,058
<i>For making whoopee</i>

333
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,688
Look, you aren't gonna shoot us
in the eye, are you, Peter?

334
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,274
Oh, no, Joe. I wouldn't try
to shoot you in the eye.

335
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,484
<i>-A lot of shoes</i>
<i>-We're throwing shoes</i>

336
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,778

<i>-It's all so... </i>(SCREAMING)

337
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:42,406
Peter, it was really close to my eye!

338
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,575
Relax, Joe. I'm nowhere near your eye.

339
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,076
Hey, Joe, open your eye.

340
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,871
-(SCREAMING)
-Gotcha.

341
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,873
What the hell, Peter!
You shot him in the eye!

342
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,583
Keep singing, you. And keep your chin up,

343
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,667
so I can see your throat.

344
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,460
No, no screw this! You're a jerk!

345
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,296
Jerk? What kind of a way is that

346
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,131
to talk to your friend
who gives you money?

347
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,008
Go to hell, Peter!
We don't need your money!

348
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,801
And we don't need friends like you!

349
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,344
Yeah! We're out of here!

350
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,554
Fine, go on. I don't care.

351
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,222
I don't need you, I got money!

352
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,641
You know, Peter,
you used to be a great guy.

353
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,268
But ever since you won that lottery...

354
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,645
(SCREAMING)

355
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:14,771
Come on, Joe!

356
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,565
(BLEEP) this guy! Aah!

357
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,820
I'm here to audition
for <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

358
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,572
Come right in.

359
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,124
Peter, my God,
what the hell are you wearing?

360
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,126
It's a solid gold tuxedo, Lois.

361
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,544
I had to fight three rappers

362
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,379
down at the Nonsense Store for this.

363
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,381
Look, Peter, this is not who we are.

364
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,717
I'm worried the money
is changing this family,

365
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,010
and not the way you hoped.

366
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,262
Well, I was hoping it would make
you shut up, so you're right.

367
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,139
You know, I spoke to Bonnie this morning,

368
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,975
and she said you haven't talked
to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks.

369
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,685
Who cares? I don't need Quagmire.

370
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,437
And I certainly don't need Joe.

371
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,813
I got Money Joe.

372
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,982
(LAUGHING) That's a good one, Money Joe!

373
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,109
I don't like what this money
is doing to us.

374
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,320
It's even affecting Brian and Stewie.

375
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,531
(YAWNING) I think I'm gonna take a nap.

376
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,741
-What, here?
-Yeah, I had a giant mobile

377
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,160
put in the sky so I can
sleep wherever I want.

378
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,704
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

379
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,207
(SIGHING) This is nice.

380
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,584
I hope that bear comes around soon.

381
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,962
That's sort of my fave--
Oh, look, the bear!

382
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,380
And it's not just them.

383
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:24,550
Chris has also been developing
some very expensive tastes.

384
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,677
Model glue, sir?

385
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,470
Well, what do we have today?

386
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,807
Today we have a recent vintage
procured just this morning

387
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,350
from Michael's Hobby Shop.

388
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,394
Yes, that's very nice.

389
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,437
Bring me my finest rag.

390
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,189
Your fancy rag, sir.

391
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,316
You are relieved for the evening.

392
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,280
(INHALING DEEPLY

393
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,408
You don't see poor people doing this!

394
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,826
Lois, don't you understand?

395
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,870
We don't got any of
our old problems anymore.

396
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,705
We don't have to worry about paying bills,

397
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,665
we don't have to worry about saving dough.

398
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,168
All we got to do is enjoy ourselves.

399
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,419
Interested?

400
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,005
(GASPING)

401
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,340
Oh, my God.

402
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,677
Peter, it's beautiful!

403
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,137
Is it a blood diamond?

404
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,597
Ah, the bloodiest.

405
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,016
The two kids who found it were
forced to murder each other.

406
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,976
Oh, Peter, I love it.

407
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,812
Hey, you want to watch a DVD
of the murder while we do it?

408
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,189
I already watched it eight times,

409
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,524
so I know exactly
which part I want to blam at.

410
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,821
Chris, Meg, now that I'm a rich father,

411
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,532
you will try to impress me,
and I will remain distant.

412
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:33,702
-Go.
-Um, say, Dad, did I tell you

413
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,787
I got second place in the yacht race?

414
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,290
Hmm. Sounds like somebody's dad

415
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,708
is happier than me right now.

416
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,668
Well, um, how about this, Dad?

417
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,504
The school paper is doing
a story about me.

418
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,380
That's because I had it arranged.

419
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,800
Uh, I was thinking about joining the Army?

420
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,637
No. Meg, as a girl,
your life holds no merit.

421
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,597
And, Chris, try as you may,
you will never be

422
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,641
as good as your older brother who died.

423
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,392
He was good at sports and talking.

424
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,394
Now, pardon me while I look at scrimshaw

425
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,104
through a magnifying glass.

426
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,565
Ah, brave men all.

427
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,567
Lost sons of New Bedford.

428
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,319
That's good scrimshaw.

429
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,783
Ah, I never thought I'd be having high tea

430
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,035
at the Park Barrington every single day.

431
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,871
Yes, it's nice to eat in a sea
of white faces, isn't it?

432
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:21,500
Waiter, have the chef prepare
a bucket of your finest caviar,

433
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,418
and then give it
a helicopter tour of the city.

434
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,671
-Very good, sir.
-Very good indeed.

435
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,799
I hope it enjoys it as much as
that Maine lobster I ordered.

436
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,218
And over there is the
Rhode Island State House,

437
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,554
the second largest
self-supporting marble dome

438
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,430
in North America.

439
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,723
Why the (BLEEP) am I doing this?

440
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,225
I could've just said I did it.

441
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,018
Sir, about your bill...

442
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,478
Oh, don't worry, Carstairs,

443
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,564
there's ample gratuity on there for you.

444
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:44,690
(CHUCKLES) Nyah.

445
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,818
Well, actually, sir,
your card has been declined.

446
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,319
(LAUGHING) Oh, really?

447
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,613
Well, I'm sure a brief call
to my accountant

448
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,032
will resolve this
to our mutual satisfaction.

449
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,202
Hello, Schnozzenstein?

450
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:58,412
This is Peter Griffin.

451
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,455
There seems to be
some issue with our credit.

452
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,709
I told Carstairs
you'd set everything straight.

453
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:04,918
What do you mean I'm broke?

454
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,421
What about all that money
I sent to the Gayman Islands?

455
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,047
They did what with it!

456
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,216
No, I don't want it back!

457
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,968
I'm gonna miss you, Carstairs.

458
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,512
I shall miss you, too, sir.

459
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,014
With no one to look after,

460
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,057
Carstairs fell into a deep depression

461
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,684
from which he never emerged.

462
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,603
He died two weeks later.

463
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,146
Some say of a broken heart.

464
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,690
-What, sir?
-But that was Carstairs.

465
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,570
I can't believe it.

466
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,030
We lost everything.

467
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,406
What do we do now?

468
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,825
Well, seems like our
only hope is the lottery.

469
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,828
Holy (BLEEP), we won twice
and we're right back here again.

470
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:43,540
We had $150 million,
and we blew through it in a month.

471
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,626
Yeah, but on the bright side,
if this hadn't happened,

472
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,503
-we never would've met Kyle.
-Hey.

473
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,587
-Hello.
-Hey there.

474
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:49,713
-Hi.
-What's up?

475
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,923
And that's not even Kyle.

476
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,716
Peter, we can't live like this.

477
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,051
Well, what are we supposed to do, Lois?

478
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,469
Everything we had is gone!

479
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,095
We have friends, Peter.

480
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,305
Not anymore, we don't.

481
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,432
They're good people. They'll listen.

482
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,392
And they'll care what happens to us,

483
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,020
even after everything that's happened.

484
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,314
You know, I'm still young
enough you can drop me

485
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,316
at the fire station, no questions asked.

486
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:19,701
Well, well. Look who it is.

487
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,370
-Who is it?
-It's me, Peter.

488
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,454
I'm standing right here.

489
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,081
This is a glass eye, Peter.

490
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,874
They had to remove the one you shot.

491
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,252
Oh, boy, that whole day was a mess, huh?

492
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,128
What happened to you, anyway?
You look terrible.

493
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,714
Look, you guys, I messed up bad.

494
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,550
Winning the lottery was the worst thing

495
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,343
that ever happened to me and my family.

496
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,971
I thought being rich
would solve all my problems,

497
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:42,182
but all it did was make me
forget what was important.

498
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,518
Like who my real friends are.

499
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,061
I don't expect you to forgive me,

500
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,606
but if, for some reason,
you do, you can find me

501
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,484
in a cardboard box on the corner
of Meeting and Thayer.

502
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,612
Peter, wait.

503
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,949
That corner's a bit of a hike for me.

504
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,617
I'd rather just come see you at home.

505
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,414
What-- where'd you get this kind of money?

506
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:08,041
The penis enlargement pill you
gave me the startup money for.

507
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,793
It turned a pretty nice profit.

508
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,296
I guess it's only fair
that I give you my percentage

509
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,630
so you can get your house back.

510
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:17,467
Quagmire, I don't know what to say.

511
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,469
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

512
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,597
And if it makes you feel better,
it was money well spent.

513
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,348
Just ask Sandra the waitress over there.

514
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,142
We had a great time last night.

515
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,145
PETER: Tough girl. Made it into work.

516
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,941
Boy, I got to say, it's good to be home.

517
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,027
Yeah. Despite all the ups and downs,

518
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,570
things turned out for the best.

519
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,198
I mean, really, we're no worse
off than we were before.

520
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,866
Plus, we learned something.

521
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,784
And you can't put a price on that.

522
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,369
Look, Lois, we all know what happened.

523
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:45,579
We're all depressed.

524
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,247
All right, let's just
go to different rooms

525
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,958
and stare blankly out the window,
saying nothing.

526
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,969
