Peter, what's
going on?

17
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:37,733
What's going on, Lois,
is that this girl

18
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,519
is obviously not well,
and I have just learned

19
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:42,154
that she's been stealing
from the show,

20
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:45,558
and she should probably
be escorted out of the building.

For what?

33
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:22,244
I've decided I want to open
a sushi restaurant.

34
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:23,446
What do you know
about sushi?

35
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:24,930
I don't care
about the sushi.

36
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:27,416
I just want to yell at customers
when they walk in the door.

We're running seriously
low on cash right now.

00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:42,198
In fact, I may have to
get my own full-time job.

42
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:44,417
Geez. Are we really living
that close to the edge?

43
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:45,701
You know we
are, Brian.

44
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,436
Why do you think
we waited so long

45
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:49,138
to take you to the
groomer's last month?

46
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:54,727
Hey, isn't it time for me
to get a haircut?

47
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:57,029
Oh, no. I think
you just got one.

48
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:58,364
Are you sure?

49
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:00,366
'Cause I feel like
my nails are really long.

50
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,067
Yeah, I'll check,
but I'm pretty sure

51
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:03,819
it's not for another
couple of weeks.

The Rhode Island
State Lottery

60
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:22,154
has climbed to a record
$150 million jackpot.

00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:23,522
That's right, Tom.

Powerball fever has
officially gripped Quahog.

63

We sent Channel Five News
Asian correspondent

64
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:31,230
Tricia Takanawa around town
to get the public reaction.

65
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:34,633
Mayor West, what do you plan
to do if you win the lottery?

66
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,836
Well, I'd finally
splurge and buy myself

67
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:39,538
one of those fancy
four-piece suits.

68
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:41,474
I'd like to join
your country club.

69
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,876
I assume that won't
be a problem.

70
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:47,513
And how about you,
every Persian guy in the world?

71
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:49,849
White BMW.

72
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:50,916
There you go, Lois.

73
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:52,084
That's the answer right there.

74
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:53,686
We'll just win the lottery.

75
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:56,255
In fact, I'm going to go buy
my winning ticket right now.

76
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:02,311
Peter, what's wrong?

77
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,479
It's, uh, nothing.

78
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:05,397
I'm just going
to wait a minute.

79
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,900
There's teenagers
in skinny jeans out there.

80
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:14,173
Everyone, I got big news.

81
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:17,109
We are going
to be rich.

82
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:18,661
Oh, my God, Peter.

83
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:20,663
There are thousands of
lottery tickets here.

84
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,665
Where did you get the
money for all these?

85
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:25,000
Simple. I took out a second
mortgage on the house.

86
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:26,886
What?!
Peter, this is idiotic.

87
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:29,004
Your odds of winning
are like 100 million to one.

88
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,941
Don't you know the lottery
is just a tax on stupid people?

89
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:33,592
Would you be saying
that if the prize

90
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,961
was 150 million bags of
the neighbor's garbage?

91
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,062
But it's not.

92
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,430
I mean... I mean, is it?

93
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,616
It's... that-that is an
unrealistic, unfair question.

94
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:41,967
Peter, Brian's right.

95
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:43,869
How can you be
so irresponsible?

96
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:45,521
You take these tickets
back right now.

97
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:46,555
No way, Lois.

98
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:47,756
We're going to win.

99
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:49,458
I got lots of good
karma built up

100
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:50,910
from doing those
USO shows.

101
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:53,863
So, apparently, they found

102
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,998
a weapon of mass destruction--
my putter.

103
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:00,452
All right, boys.
Go get 'em over there.

135
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:09,069
Okay, I don't know
what she's doing now.

136
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,270
Somebody turn the machine off.

137

161
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,486

162
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:03,038
Well, that's it.

163
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:06,275
Three days wasted looking
through 200,000 lottery tickets.

164
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:07,743
Those weren't
the lottery tickets.

165
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:09,278
That was a test.

166
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:11,297
These are
the lottery tickets.

167
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:14,867
Is this another test?

168
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,168
Yes.

169
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:17,770
These aren't the real
lottery tickets, either.

170
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:20,189
These are the real
lottery tickets.

171
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:23,642
So, in addition to buying
200,000 lottery tickets,

172
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,111
you had 400,000 fake ones
printed up?

173
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,981
I had to be sure.

174
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,334
Oh, my God. We won!

175
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:33,719
What?
Let me see that.

176
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:36,922
Yes! We won the lottery!

177
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,324
I'm getting a penis butler.

178
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,508
Sir?

179
00:06:39,576 --> 00:06:41,393
All right, butle
my penis. Butle it!

180
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:47,939
This is awesome.

181
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:49,173
Now that we're rich,

182
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:51,008
our lives are going
to be so much better.

183
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,643
You sure it was
such a good idea

184
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,112
to cash that
lottery check?

185
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:56,514
It seems foolish to have
all this money lying around.

186
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,449
Oh, you'd rather have
it down at the bank

187
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:00,051
where the Jewish
guys can leer at it?

188
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,736
Yeah!
All right!

189
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:02,837
Money!

190
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:04,238
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

191
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:06,541
Hello?

192
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,309
Did you blow all your money yet?
No, Daddy.

193
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:09,877
All right. Call me
when you blow all your money.

194
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:11,345
Love you. Bye.

195
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,081
All right, so how are we
going to spend our winnings?

196
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:14,682
I'm going to get some
supermarket fried chicken

197
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,684
and eat it until I'm nauseous.

198
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,570
I'm going to finally get my gal
that doodad she's been wantin'!

199
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:21,672
I'm going to get a floor mirror
to squat over

200
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,541
and see what's making
all that noise.

201
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,343
Okay, everybody
just calm down.

202
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,211
We're not going to go crazy
spending our winnings,

203
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,247
and we're not going to let
this money change us.

204
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:30,715
What are you talking about?

205
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,084
This money is our ticket
to the good life, starting now.

206
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,620
I just bought a giant room
full of gold coins,

207
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:38,122
and I'm going to dive into it
like Scrooge McDuck.

208
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,428
Aah! It's not a liquid!

209
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:47,732
It's a great many pieces
of solid matter

210
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,268
that form a hard,
floor-like surface!

211
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:51,702
Aah!

212
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,025
Peter, what are you
doing here?

213
00:07:58,093 --> 00:07:59,460
Shouldn't you
be at work?

214
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:00,962
I quit my job, Lois.

215
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:02,663
You what?
Yeah, we're rich now.

216
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:04,065
I don't need to be working.

217
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,299
Ah, you should've
been there, Lois.

218
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,401
I told Angela what she could do
with that job,

219
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,370
just like I always fantasized.

220
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:11,005
Angela, I just want
to thank you

221
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,107
for several extremely
pleasurable years

222
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:14,408
working for this
corporation.

223
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:16,711
Uh, certain
unexpected developments

224
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:18,312
have created
a situation

225
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,548
where I am no longer
in need of employment.

226
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,383
Uh, I would be
remiss, however,

227
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,685
if I did not extend
my gratitude to you

228
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:27,188
for your unwavering
fairness and belief in me,

229
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,357
and there is a giant poo
on your desk.

230
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,545
Hey, Horace,
another round for everybody.

231
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:38,482
Gosh, Peter,
you're really

232
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,617
being generous
with your money.

233
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,152
Hey, what's the point
of being rich

234
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,054
if you can't share it
with your pals, huh?

235
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,338
Okay, wait,
I-I got one.

236
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:45,740
Who would you
rather do?

237
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,575
Susan Boyle
or a sex doll

238
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,594
that's been passed
around a fraternity?

239
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,062
Well, have they been
cleaning the doll?

240
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,314
Please, these guys are Betas--
they're total animals.

241
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:54,448
Hey, I got
one, Peter.

242
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:55,650
What would you
rather do?

243
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,285
Tread water where
you are right now

244
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:59,120
or increase your
net worth fivefold

245
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:00,454
within the next
18 months?

246
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:01,589
Huh?

247
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:03,191
What? I... what are you
talking about?

248
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:05,326
Well, my friend Marty
is a whiz with chemistry,

249
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:06,794
and he says
he's come up

250
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:08,379
with a new penis
enlargement pill,

251
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,499
and if we can bankroll him
$100,000 in startup money,

252
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,401
he'll triple our
investment in a year.

253
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:16,037
Well, uh...
gee, I-I'm... I don't, uh...

254
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:17,438
Peter, I've taken
the liberty

255
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,373
of mocking up some
sales projections.

256
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:20,875
Wow, that's pretty good.

257
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,877
And this would be
our net profits.

258
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,078
Yikes.

259
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,580
You know, Peter, uh,

260
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:28,916
Bonnie's birthday is coming up,
and I'll be gol-darned

261
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:31,719
if I didn't go ahead and
promise her that Stevie Nicks

262
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:34,722
would come to our house
and sing three songs to her.

263
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,059
Boy, do I got a big mouth, huh?

264
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:40,328
Yeah, if you're going to open
your mouth with the missus,

265
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:41,596
stick to kisses, huh?

266
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,901
What neat humor.
What neat humor.

267
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:49,237
So what do say, Peter?
Can you help us out?

268
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:50,705
Of course I can, you dope.

269
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:52,423
We're pals, right?

270
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:56,193
There you go.

271
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:57,228
Hey, Horace,
give us

272
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,529
three shots
of your best bourbon.

273
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,915
And have that Russian waiter
I like bring it over.

00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,224
that all his kids
were stillborn, huh?

290
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,526
All right, well,
thanks again, Peter.

291
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:46,994
I got to head out.

292
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:48,963
I told my mother I'd visit
her in the hospital.

293
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:50,414
Yeah, and I got to work.

294
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:51,882
I'm flying a leg
to Minneapolis tonight.

295
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,217
Oh.

296
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:54,518
Yeah, I-I-I understand.

297
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:55,786
You... you've got
other things to do.

298
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:57,388
I-I just wrote you guys
a couple of checks,

299
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,073
but no, you... you-you-you
do your things.

300
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:00,908
What?
No, I mean, I-I'm just saying,

301
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:03,311
I-I thought friends hang out,
do things with each other.

302
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:04,929
You know,
especially when one friend

303
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,348
gives the other friends
a whole bunch of money.

304
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,935
Oh. Well, I guess I
could stick around.

305
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,038
Yeah, and I-I guess
the co-pilot can fly the plane.

306
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,941
She's a woman and passengers
are usually okay with that.

307
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,309
I once saw a
deodorant commercial

308
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,643
that had a
woman pilot.

309
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,262
That's more like it.

310
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:23,781
From now on, we're all gonna do
whatever I want to do.

311
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,132
'Cause I'm the one
with the dough.

312
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,834
Okay, I guess that's fair.

313
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,569
Good.
'Cause what I want to do is

314
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:30,638
stay here, get drunk
and watch TV.

315
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:33,808
We now return to <i>Michael</i>
<i>McDonald During Allergy Season.</i>

316
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,743
Haa...

317
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,062
Haa-haa...

318
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,147
Haa-haa-haa-haa-haa...

319
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,615
Haa...

320
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
♪ Haa-chu! ♪

321
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,005
Hey, Peter, you wanted me
to watch the entire first season

322
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:50,608
of <i>True Blood</i> and come show you
where there was boob?

323
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,076
That's right, I
don't want to see

324
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,411
any actual <i>True</i>
<i>Blood,</i> just boob.

325
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:54,678
Yeah, well, I found some.

326
00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:58,766
No!

327
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:01,235
Anna Paquin boob does
not count as real boob!

328
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,471
That's like looking
at a 12-year-old boy.

329
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:05,573
Geez. Y-You should
know that, Joe!

330
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,674
You should
definitely know that!

331
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,042
Sorry, Peter.

332
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,044
Sorry doesn't show me
nipples worth seeing!

333
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,880
And as for you, Anna, you're
dreadful and so is the program.

334
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,081
I didn't write it.

335
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,783
Yeah, but you know
the people who do.

336
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,385
That Alan Ball--
you know him, right?

337
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:18,419
Yeah.

338
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,520
How come everything
he writes

339
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,422
is so dreary?
I don't know.

340
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,157
Tell him to cheer up!
Things ain't so bad!

341
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:25,626
This is a weird episode.

342
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:29,663
Okay, Quagmire, I want you
to take the first bite

343
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:31,031
out of this fudge pop,

344
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:33,467
because that first bite
is the one that really hurts.

345
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,903
Well, okay.

346
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,692
Ah! Ow!

347
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,693
Ow!

348
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,761
Yeah, that's right "Ow."

349
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:44,862
Now, you swallow that.

350
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,163
Don't you dare spit that out.

351
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:47,114
What's the
difference?

352
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:48,032
You got what
you wanted.

353
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,049
I said swallow it!

354
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,769
Now, smear what's
left of it on your face

355
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:55,689
and look at me
with your mouth open.

356
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:57,892
Look at yourself,
you filthy whore.

357
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:02,196
I don't even
want this now.

358
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,370
Okay, guys, now you're gonna do
a synchronized duet

359
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:11,939
of "Makin' Whoopee" while
I shoot you with this BB gun.

360
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:12,973
That doesn't
sound safe.

361
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:13,808

Relax, Joe.

376
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:44,638
I'm nowhere near your eye.

377
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:46,106
Hey, Joe, open your eye.

378
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,943
Gotcha.

379
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,911
What the hell, Peter?!
You shot him in the eye!

380
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:52,379
Keep singing, you.
And keep your chin up,

381
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:53,614
so I can see your throat.

382
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:55,399
No, no screw this!
You're a jerk!

383
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,201
Jerk? What kind of a way is that

384
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,036
to talk to your friend
who gives you money?

385
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,137
Go to hell, Peter!

386
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:01,338
We don't need
your money!

387
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:02,840
And we don't need
friends like you!

388
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,208
Yeah! We're out of here!

389
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,476
Fine, go on. I don't care.

390
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,311
I don't need you, I got money!

391
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,647
You know, Peter,
you used to be a great guy.

392
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:11,248
But ever since
you won that lottery...

393
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,518
Come on, Joe!

394
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,320
this guy!
Aah!

395
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,692
I'm here to audition
for <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

396
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,093
Come right in.

397
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,861
Peter, my God, what the
hell are you wearing?

398
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:35,979
It's a solid gold
tuxedo, Lois.

399
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:37,448
I had to fight three rappers

400
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:39,349
down at the Nonsense Store
for this.

401
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,151
Look, Peter, this
is not who we are.

402
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:43,253
I'm worried the money
is changing this family,

403
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,755
and not the
way you hoped.

404
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:47,090
Well, I was hoping it would make
you shut up, so you're right.

405
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,892
You know, I spoke to
Bonnie this morning,

406
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,862
and she said you haven't talked
to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks.

407
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,413
Who cares?
I don't need Quagmire.

408
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:55,115
And I certainly don't need Joe.

409
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:56,416
I got Money Joe.

410
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:58,802
That's a good one, Money Joe!

411
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,971
I don't like what this money
is doing to us.

412
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,073
It's even affecting
Brian and Stewie.

413
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:05,375
I think I'm gonna
take a nap.

414
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:07,578
What, here?
Yeah, I had a giant mobile

415
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,997
put in the sky so I can
sleep wherever I want.

416
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,852
This is nice.

417
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:17,170
I hope that bear
comes around soon.

418
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:19,773
That's sort of my fave--
Oh, look, the bear!

419
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,291
And it's not just them.

420
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:24,261
Chris has also been developing
some very expensive tastes.

421
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:26,597
Model glue, sir?

422
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,315
Well, what do
we have today?

423
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:31,468
Today we have a recent vintage
procured just this morning

424
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:33,220
from Michael's Hobby Shop.

425
00:15:33,288 --> 00:15:35,289
Yes, that's
very nice.

426
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:37,257
Bring me my
finest rag.

427
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:39,076
Your fancy rag, sir.

428
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,928
You are relieved
for the evening.

429
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:49,186
You don't see
poor people doing this!

430
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:50,420
Lois, don't you understand?

431
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:52,689
We don't got any of
our old problems anymore.

432
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:54,625
We don't have to worry
about paying bills,

433
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,510
we don't have to worry
about saving dough.

434
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:58,979
All we got to do
is enjoy ourselves.

435
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,063
Interested?

436
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,235
Oh, my God.

437
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,572
Peter, it's
beautiful!

438
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,873
Is it a blood
diamond?

439
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:11,308
Ah, the bloodiest.

440
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:13,977
The two kids who found it were
forced to murder each other.

441
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,812
Oh, Peter,
I love it.

442
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,749
Hey, you want to watch a DVD
of the murder while we do it?

443
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,033
I already watched it
eight times,

444
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:22,236
so I know exactly
which part I want to blam at.

445
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,874
Chris, Meg, now that
I'm a rich father,

446
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:30,377
you will try to impress me,
and I will remain distant.

447
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:31,478
Go.

448
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,580
Um, say, Dad,
did I tell you

449
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:35,749
I got second place
in the yacht race?

450
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:38,018
Hmm. Sounds like
somebody's dad

451
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:39,686
is happier than
me right now.

452
00:16:39,754 --> 00:16:41,388
Well, um, how about this, Dad?

453
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:43,523
The school paper is
doing a story about me.

454
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,325
That's because I
had it arranged.

455
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:48,161
Uh, I was thinking about
joining the Army?

456
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:49,429
No.

457
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:51,431
Meg, as a girl, your
life holds no merit.

458
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:53,667
And, Chris, try as you
may, you will never be

459
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:55,535
as good as your older
brother who died.

460
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:57,237
He was good at
sports and talking.

461
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:59,156
Now, pardon me
while I look at scrimshaw

462
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:00,924
through a magnifying glass.

463
00:17:00,992 --> 00:17:03,427
Ah, brave men all.

464
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:05,395
Lost sons of New Bedford.

465
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:07,064
That's good scrimshaw.

466
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:12,736
Ah, I never thought
I'd be having high tea

467
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:15,005
at the Park Barrington
every single day.

468
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:17,774
Yes, it's nice to eat in a sea
of white faces, isn't it?

469
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:21,111
Waiter, have the chef prepare
a bucket of your finest caviar,

470
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,163
and then give it
a helicopter tour of the city.

471
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:24,197
Very good, sir.

472
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:25,732
Very good indeed.

473
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,702
I hope it enjoys it as much as
that Maine lobster I ordered.

474
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,171
And over there is the
Rhode Island State House,

475
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,440
the second largest
self-supporting marble dome

476
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:34,875
in North America.

477
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:36,443
Why the
am I doing this?

478
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,045
I could've just
said I did it.

479
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:39,780
Sir, about
your bill...

480
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:41,381
Oh, don't worry, Carstairs,

481
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:43,517
there's ample gratuity
on there for you.

482
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:44,885
Nyah.

483
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:47,688
Well, actually, sir, your
card has been declined.

484
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:49,122
Oh, really?

485
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,541
Well, I'm sure a brief call
to my accountant

486
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,744
will resolve this
to our mutual satisfaction.

487
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:56,980
Hello, Schnozzenstein?

488
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:58,382
This is Peter Griffin.

489
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,384
There seems to be
some issue with our credit.

490
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:03,253
I told Carstairs
you'd set everything straight.

491
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:04,755
What do you mean I'm broke?!

492
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:07,107
What about all that money
I sent to the Gayman Islands?

493
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:08,909
They did what with it?!

494
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:11,011
No, I don't want it back!

495
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,729
I'm gonna miss you,
Carstairs.

496
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:15,265
I shall miss
you, too, sir.

497
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,950
With no one to look after,

498
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:18,785
Carstairs fell into
a deep depression

499
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:20,554
from which he never emerged.

500
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:22,389
He died two weeks later.

501
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:24,024
Some say of a broken heart.

502
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:25,025
What, sir?

503
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:26,326
But that was Carstairs.

504
00:18:29,897 --> 00:18:31,381
I can't believe it.

505
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,716
We lost everything.

506
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:34,317
What do we do now?

507
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:36,586
Well, seems like our
only hope is the lottery.

508
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:39,723
Holy (bleep), we won twice and
we're right back here again.

509
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,160
We had $150 million, and
we blew through it in a month.

510
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:45,345
Yeah, but on the bright side,
if this hadn't happened,

511
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,480
we never would've met Kyle.

512
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:48,148
Hey.

513
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:49,182
Hello. Hey there.
Hi. What's up?

514
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,751
And that's not even Kyle.

515
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:52,285
Peter, we can't
live like this.

516
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:54,004
Well, what are we
supposed to do, Lois?

517
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:55,205
Everything we
had is gone!

518
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:56,823
We have friends, Peter.

519
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:58,108
Not anymore, we don't.

520
00:18:58,176 --> 00:18:59,342
They're good people.

521
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,444
They'll listen.

522
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,145
And they'll care
what happens to us,

523
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:04,915
even after everything
that's happened.

524
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:07,217
You know, I'm still young
enough you can drop me

525
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:09,052
at the fire station,
no questions asked.

526
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:19,429
Well, well.
Look who it is.

527
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:20,397
Who is it?

528
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:21,515
It's me, Peter.

529
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:22,449
I'm standing
right here.

530
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:23,950
This is a glass eye, Peter.

531
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:25,719
They had to remove
the one you shot.

532
00:19:25,787 --> 00:19:28,188
Oh, boy, that whole
day was a mess, huh?

533
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:29,956
What happened to you, anyway?
You look terrible.

534
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:32,392
Look, you guys,
I messed up bad.

535
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,394
Winning the lottery
was the worst thing

536
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:36,296
that ever happened
to me and my family.

537
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:38,832
I thought being rich
would solve all my problems,

538
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,935
but all it did was make me
forget what was important.

539
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:44,070
Like who my real friends are.

540
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:45,822
I don't expect
you to forgive me,

541
00:19:45,907 --> 00:19:49,409
but if, for some reason, you do,
you can find me

542
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,111
in a cardboard box on the corner
of Meeting and Thayer.

543
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,165
Peter, wait.

544
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,718
That corner's
a bit of a hike for me.

545
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:00,303
I'd rather just
come see you at home.

546
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:05,158
What-- where'd you get
this kind of money?

547
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:07,727
The penis enlargement pill you
gave me the startup money for.

548
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:09,246
It turned a pretty nice profit.

549
00:20:09,313 --> 00:20:11,681
I guess it's only fair
that I give you my percentage

550
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:13,400
so you can get your house back.

551
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:17,170
Quagmire, I don't know
what to say.

552
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:18,305
Thank you.

553
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:19,689
You're welcome.

554
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:21,708
And if it makes you feel better,
it was money well spent.

555
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,260
Just ask Sandra
the waitress over there.

556
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:24,878
We had a great time
last night.

557
00:20:24,946 --> 00:20:26,513
Tough girl.

558
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:27,881
Made it into work.

559
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,919
Boy, I got to say,
it's good to be home.

560
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,754
Yeah. Despite all
the ups and downs,

561
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:36,389
things turned out for the best.

562
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:39,059
I mean, really, we're no worse
off than we were before.

563
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:40,727
Plus, we learned something.

564
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:42,562
And you can't
put a price on that.

565
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,964
Look, Lois, we all know
what happened.

566
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:45,164
We're all depressed.

567
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:46,883
All right, let's just
go to different rooms

568
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:48,785
and stare blankly
out the window, saying nothing.

569
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:52,853

570
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,879
Congratulations to
tonight's sweepstakes winner,

571
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:00,831
Daniel San Martin Marrero.

572
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:02,032
Shapes.
Shut up.
