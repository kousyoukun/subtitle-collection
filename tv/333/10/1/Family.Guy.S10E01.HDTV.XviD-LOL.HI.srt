Peter, what's
going on?

17
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:37,733
What's going on, Lois,
is that this girl

18
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,519
is obviously not well,
and I have just learned

19
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:42,154
that she's been stealing
from the show,

20
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:45,558
and she should probably
be escorted out of the building.

For what?

34
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:22,244
I've decided I want to open
a sushi restaurant.

35
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:23,446
What do you know
about sushi?

36
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:24,930
I don't care
about the sushi.

37
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:27,416
I just want to yell at customers
when they walk in the door.

anything else.

We're running seriously
low on cash right now.

43
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:42,198
In fact, I may have to
get my own full-time job.

44
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:44,417
Geez. Are we really living
that close to the edge?

45
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:45,701
You know we
are, Brian.

46
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,436
Why do you think
we waited so long

47
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:49,138
to take you to the
groomer's last month?

48
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:54,727
Hey, isn't it time for me
to get a haircut?

49
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:57,029
Oh, no. I think
you just got one.

50
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:58,364
Are you sure?

51
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:00,366
'Cause I feel like
my nails are really long.

52
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,067
Yeah, I'll check,
but I'm pretty sure

it's not for another

The Rhode Island
State Lottery

63
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:22,154
has climbed to a record
$150 million jackpot.

That's right, Tom.

Powerball fever has

We sent Channel Five News

Tricia Takanawa around town
to get the public reaction.

68
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:34,633
Mayor West, what do you plan
to do if you win the lottery?

69
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,836
Well, I'd finally
splurge and buy myself

70
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:39,538
one of those fancy
four-piece suits.

71
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:41,474
I'd like to join
your country club.

72
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,876
I assume that won't
be a problem.

73
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:47,513
And how about you,
every Persian guy in the world?

74
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:49,849
ALL:
White BMW.

75
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:50,916
There you go, Lois.

76
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:52,084
That's the answer right there.

77
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:53,686
We'll just win the lottery.

78
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:56,255
In fact, I'm going to go buy
my winning ticket right now.

79
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:02,311
Peter, what's wrong?

80
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,479
It's, uh, nothing.

81
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:05,397
I'm just going
to wait a minute.

82
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,900
There's teenagers
in skinny jeans out there.

83
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:14,173
Everyone, I got big news.

84
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:17,109
We are going
to be rich.

85
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:18,661
Oh, my God, Peter.

86
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:20,663
There are thousands of
lottery tickets here.

87
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,665
Where did you get the
money for all these?

88
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:25,000
Simple. I took out a second
mortgage on the house.

89
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:26,886
What?!
Peter, this is idiotic.

90
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:29,004
Your odds of winning
are like 100 million to one.

91
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,941
Don't you know the lottery
is just a tax on stupid people?

92
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:33,592
Would you be saying
that if the prize

93
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,961
was 150 million bags of
the neighbor's garbage?

94
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,062
But it's not.

95
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,430
I mean... I mean, is it?

96
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,616
It's... that-that is an
unrealistic, unfair question.

97
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:41,967
Peter, Brian's right.

98
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:43,869
How can you be
so irresponsible?

99
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:45,521
You take these tickets
back right now.

100
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:46,555
No way, Lois.

101
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:47,756
We're going to win.

102
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:49,458
I got lots of good
karma built up

103
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:50,910

(laughter)

105
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:53,863
So, apparently, they found

106
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,998
a weapon of mass destruction--
my putter.

Well, that's it.

171
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:06,275
Three days wasted looking
through 200,000 lottery tickets.

172
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:07,743
Those weren't
the lottery tickets.

173
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:09,278
That was a test.

174
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:11,297
These are
the lottery tickets.

175
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:14,867
Is this another test?

176
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,168
Yes.

177
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:17,770
These aren't the real
lottery tickets, either.

178
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:20,189
These are the real
lottery tickets.

179
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:23,642
So, in addition to buying
200,000 lottery tickets,

180
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,111
you had 400,000 fake ones
printed up?

181
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,981
I had to be sure.

182
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,334
Oh, my God. We won!

183
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:33,719
What?
Let me see that.

184
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:36,922
Yes! We won the lottery!

185
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,324
I'm getting a penis butler.

186
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,508
Sir?

187
00:06:39,576 --> 00:06:41,393
All right, butle
my penis. Butle it!

188
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:47,939
This is awesome.

189
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:49,173
Now that we're rich,

190
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:51,008
our lives are going
to be so much better.

191
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,643
You sure it was
such a good idea

192
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,112
to cash that
lottery check?

193
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:56,514
It seems foolish to have
all this money lying around.

194
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,449
Oh, you'd rather have
it down at the bank

195
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:00,051
where the Jewish
guys can leer at it?

196
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,736
Yeah!
All right!

197
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:02,837
Money!
(whistling)

198
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:04,238
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

199
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:06,541
(phone rings)
Hello?

200
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,309
CARTER: Did you blow all your money yet?
No, Daddy.

201
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:09,877
All right. Call me
when you blow all your money.

202
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:11,345
Love you. Bye.

203
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,081
All right, so how are we
going to spend our winnings?

204
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:14,682
I'm going to get some
supermarket fried chicken

205
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,684
and eat it until I'm nauseous.

206
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,570
I'm going to finally get my gal
that doodad she's been wantin'!

207
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:21,672
I'm going to get a floor mirror
to squat over

208
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,541
and see what's making
all that noise.

209
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,343
Okay, everybody
just calm down.

210
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,211
We're not going to go crazy
spending our winnings,

211
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,247
and we're not going to let
this money change us.

212
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:30,715
What are you talking about?

213
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,084
This money is our ticket
to the good life, starting now.

214
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,620
I just bought a giant room
full of gold coins,

215
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:38,122
and I'm going to dive into it
like Scrooge McDuck.

216
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,724
(drumroll)

217
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,428
Aah! It's not a liquid!

218
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:47,732
It's a great many pieces
of solid matter

219
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,268
that form a hard,
floor-like surface!

220
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:51,702
Aah!

221
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,025
Peter, what are you
doing here?

222
00:07:58,093 --> 00:07:59,460
Shouldn't you
be at work?

223
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:00,962
I quit my job, Lois.

224
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:02,663
You what?
Yeah, we're rich now.

225
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:04,065
I don't need to be working.

226
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,299
Ah, you should've
been there, Lois.

227
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,401
I told Angela what she could do
with that job,

228
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,370
just like I always fantasized.

229
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:11,005
Angela, I just want
to thank you

230
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,107
for several extremely
pleasurable years

231
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:14,408
working for this
corporation.

232
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:16,711
Uh, certain
unexpected developments

233
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:18,312
have created
a situation

234
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,548
where I am no longer
in need of employment.

235
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,383
Uh, I would be
remiss, however,

236
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:24,685
if I did not extend
my gratitude to you

237
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:27,188
for your unwavering
fairness and belief in me,

238
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,357
and there is a giant poo
on your desk.

239
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,545
Hey, Horace,
another round for everybody.

240
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:37,265
(patrons cheering)

241
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:38,482
Gosh, Peter,
you're really

242
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,617
being generous
with your money.

243
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,152
Hey, what's the point
of being rich

244
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,054
if you can't share it
with your pals, huh?

245
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,338
Okay, wait,
I-I got one.

246
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:45,740
Who would you
rather do?

247
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,575
Susan Boyle
or a sex doll

248
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,594
that's been passed
around a fraternity?

249
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,062
Well, have they been
cleaning the doll?

250
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,314
Please, these guys are Betas--
they're total animals.

251
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:54,448
Hey, I got
one, Peter.

252
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:55,650
What would you
rather do?

253
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,285
Tread water where
you are right now

254
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:59,120
or increase your
net worth fivefold

255
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:00,454
within the next
18 months?

256
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:01,589
Huh?

257
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:03,191
What? I... what are you
talking about?

258
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:05,326
Well, my friend Marty
is a whiz with chemistry,

259
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:06,794
and he says
he's come up

260
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:08,379
with a new penis
enlargement pill,

261
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,499
and if we can bankroll him
$100,000 in startup money,

262
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,401
he'll triple our
investment in a year.

263
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:16,037
Well, uh...
gee, I-I'm... I don't, uh...

264
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:17,438
Peter, I've taken
the liberty

265
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,373
of mocking up some
sales projections.

266
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:20,875
Wow, that's pretty good.

267
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,877
And this would be
our net profits.

268
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,078
Yikes.

269
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,580
You know, Peter, uh,

270
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:28,916
Bonnie's birthday is coming up,
and I'll be gol-darned

271
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:31,719
if I didn't go ahead and
promise her that Stevie Nicks

272
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:34,722
would come to our house
and sing three songs to her.

273
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,059
(chuckling):
Boy, do I got a big mouth, huh?

274
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:40,328
Yeah, if you're going to open
your mouth with the missus,

275
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:41,596
stick to kisses, huh?
(laughs)

276
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:44,699
(both laughing)

277
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,901
What neat humor.
What neat humor.

278
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:49,237
So what do say, Peter?
Can you help us out?

279
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:50,705
Of course I can, you dope.

280
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:52,423
We're pals, right?

281
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:56,193
There you go.

282
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:57,228
Hey, Horace,
give us

283
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,529
three shots
of your best bourbon.

284
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,915
And have that Russian waiter
I like bring it over.

285
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:02,633

that all his kids
were stillborn, huh?

302
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,526
All right, well,
thanks again, Peter.

303
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:46,994
I got to head out.

304
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:48,963
I told my mother I'd visit
her in the hospital.

305
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:50,414
Yeah, and I got to work.

306
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:51,882
I'm flying a leg
to Minneapolis tonight.

307
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,217
Oh.

308
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:54,518
Yeah, I-I-I understand.

309
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:55,786
You... you've got
other things to do.

310
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:57,388
I-I just wrote you guys
a couple of checks,

311
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,073
but no, you... you-you-you
do your things.

312
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:00,908
What?
No, I mean, I-I'm just saying,

313
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:03,311
I-I thought friends hang out,
do things with each other.

314
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:04,929
You know,
especially when one friend

315
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,348
gives the other friends
a whole bunch of money.

316
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,935
Oh. Well, I guess I
could stick around.

317
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,038
Yeah, and I-I guess
the co-pilot can fly the plane.

318
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,941
She's a woman and passengers
are usually okay with that.

319
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,309
I once saw a
deodorant commercial

320
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,643
that had a
woman pilot.

321
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,262
That's more like it.

322
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:23,781
From now on, we're all gonna do
whatever I want to do.

323
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,132
'Cause I'm the one
with the dough.

324
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,834
Okay, I guess that's fair.

325
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,569
Good.
'Cause what I want to do is

326
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:30,638
stay here, get drunk
and watch TV.

327
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:33,808
ANNOUNCER: We now return to <i>Michael</i>
<i>McDonald During Allergy Season.</i>

328
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,743
(gasping):
Haa...

329
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,062
Haa-haa...

330
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,147
Haa-haa-haa-haa-haa...

331
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,615
Haa...

332
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
(sneezes):
♪ Haa-chu! ♪

333
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,005
Hey, Peter, you wanted me
to watch the entire first season

334
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:50,608
of <i>True Blood</i> and come show you
where there was boob?

335
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,076
That's right, I
don't want to see

336
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,411
any actual <i>True</i>
<i>Blood,</i> just boob.

337
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:54,678
Yeah, well, I found some.

338
00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:58,766
No!

339
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:01,235
Anna Paquin boob does
not count as real boob!

340
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,471
That's like looking
at a 12-year-old boy.

341
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:05,573
Geez. Y-You should
know that, Joe!

342
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,674
You should
definitely know that!

343
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,042
Sorry, Peter.

344
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,044
Sorry doesn't show me
nipples worth seeing!

345
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,880
And as for you, Anna, you're
dreadful and so is the program.

346
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,081
I didn't write it.

347
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,783
Yeah, but you know
the people who do.

348
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,385
That Alan Ball--
you know him, right?

349
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:18,419
Yeah.

350
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,520
How come everything
he writes

351
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,422
is so dreary?
I don't know.

352
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,157
Tell him to cheer up!
Things ain't so bad!

353
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:25,626
This is a weird episode.

354
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:29,663
Okay, Quagmire, I want you
to take the first bite

355
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:31,031
out of this fudge pop,

356
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:33,467
because that first bite
is the one that really hurts.

357
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,903
Well, okay.

358
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:39,490
(grunting)

359
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,692
Ah! Ow!

360
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,693
Ow!

361
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,761
Yeah, that's right "Ow."

362
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:44,862
Now, you swallow that.

363
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,163
Don't you dare spit that out.

364
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:47,114
What's the
difference?

365
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:48,032
You got what
you wanted.

366
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,049
I said swallow it!

367
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:50,234
(gulps)

368
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,769
Now, smear what's
left of it on your face

369
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:55,689
and look at me
with your mouth open.

370
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:57,892
Look at yourself,
you filthy whore.

371
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:02,196
I don't even
want this now.

372
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,370
Okay, guys, now you're gonna do
a synchronized duet

373
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:11,939
of "Makin' Whoopee" while
I shoot you with this BB gun.

374
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:12,973
That doesn't
sound safe.

375
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:13,808
Action!

Relax, Joe.

392
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:44,638
I'm nowhere near your eye.

393
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:46,106
Hey, Joe, open your eye.

394
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,943
(screaming)
Gotcha.

395
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,911
What the hell, Peter?!
You shot him in the eye!

396
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:52,379
Keep singing, you.
And keep your chin up,

397
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:53,614
so I can see your throat.

398
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:55,399
No, no screw this!
You're a jerk!

399
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,201
Jerk? What kind of a way is that

400
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,036
to talk to your friend
who gives you money?

401
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,137
Go to hell, Peter!

402
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:01,338
We don't need
your money!

403
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:02,840
And we don't need
friends like you!

404
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,208
Yeah! We're out of here!

405
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,476
Fine, go on. I don't care.

406
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,311
I don't need you, I got money!

407
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,647
You know, Peter,
you used to be a great guy.

408
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:11,248
But ever since
you won that lottery...

409
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,716
(screaming)

410
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,518
Come on, Joe!

411
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,320
(bleep) this guy!
Aah!

412
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,692
I'm here to audition
for <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

413
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,093
Come right in.

414
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,861
Peter, my God, what the
hell are you wearing?

415
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:35,979
It's a solid gold
tuxedo, Lois.

416
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:37,448
I had to fight three rappers

417
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:39,349
down at the Nonsense Store
for this.

418
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,151
Look, Peter, this
is not who we are.

419
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:43,253
I'm worried the money
is changing this family,

420
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,755
and not the
way you hoped.

421
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:47,090
Well, I was hoping it would make
you shut up, so you're right.

422
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,892
You know, I spoke to
Bonnie this morning,

423
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,862
and she said you haven't talked
to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks.

424
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,413
Who cares?
I don't need Quagmire.

425
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:55,115
And I certainly don't need Joe.

426
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:56,416
I got Money Joe.

427
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:57,401
(laughs)

428
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:58,802
That's a good one, Money Joe!

429
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,971
I don't like what this money
is doing to us.

430
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,073
It's even affecting
Brian and Stewie.

431
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,208
(yawns)

432
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:05,375
I think I'm gonna
take a nap.

433
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:07,578
What, here?
Yeah, I had a giant mobile

434
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,997
put in the sky so I can
sleep wherever I want.

435
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:12,516
(mobile playing soft music)

436
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,852
(sighs)
This is nice.

437
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:17,170
I hope that bear
comes around soon.

438
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:19,773
That's sort of my fave--
Oh, look, the bear!

439
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,291
And it's not just them.

440
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:24,261
Chris has also been developing
some very expensive tastes.

441
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:26,597
Model glue, sir?

442
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,315
Well, what do
we have today?

443
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:31,468
Today we have a recent vintage
procured just this morning

444
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:33,220
from Michael's Hobby Shop.

445
00:15:33,288 --> 00:15:35,289
Yes, that's
very nice.

446
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:37,257
Bring me my
finest rag.

447
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:39,076
Your fancy rag, sir.

448
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,928
You are relieved
for the evening.

449
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:46,116
(inhales deeply)

450
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:49,186
You don't see
poor people doing this!

451
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:50,420
Lois, don't you understand?

452
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:52,689
We don't got any of
our old problems anymore.

453
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:54,625
We don't have to worry
about paying bills,

454
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:56,510
we don't have to worry
about saving dough.

455
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:58,979
All we got to do
is enjoy ourselves.

456
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,063
Interested?

457
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:02,783
(gasps)

458
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,235
Oh, my God.

459
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,572
Peter, it's
beautiful!

460
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,873
Is it a blood
diamond?

461
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:11,308
Ah, the bloodiest.

462
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:13,977
The two kids who found it were
forced to murder each other.

463
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,812
Oh, Peter,
I love it.

464
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,749
Hey, you want to watch a DVD
of the murder while we do it?

465
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,033
I already watched it
eight times,

466
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:22,236
so I know exactly
which part I want to blam at.

467
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,874
Chris, Meg, now that
I'm a rich father,

468
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:30,377
you will try to impress me,
and I will remain distant.

469
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:31,478
Go.

470
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,580
Um, say, Dad,
did I tell you

471
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:35,749
I got second place
in the yacht race?

472
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:38,018
Hmm. Sounds like
somebody's dad

473
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:39,686
is happier than
me right now.

474
00:16:39,754 --> 00:16:41,388
Well, um, how about this, Dad?

475
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:43,523
The school paper is
doing a story about me.

476
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,325
That's because I
had it arranged.

477
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:48,161
Uh, I was thinking about
joining the Army?

478
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:49,429
No.

479
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:51,431
Meg, as a girl, your
life holds no merit.

480
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:53,667
And, Chris, try as you
may, you will never be

481
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:55,535
as good as your older
brother who died.

482
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:57,237
He was good at
sports and talking.

483
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:59,156
Now, pardon me
while I look at scrimshaw

484
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:00,924
through a magnifying glass.

485
00:17:00,992 --> 00:17:03,427
Ah, brave men all.

486
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:05,395
Lost sons of New Bedford.

487
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:07,064
That's good scrimshaw.

488
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:12,736
Ah, I never thought
I'd be having high tea

489
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:15,005
at the Park Barrington
every single day.

490
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:17,774
Yes, it's nice to eat in a sea
of white faces, isn't it?

491
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:21,111
Waiter, have the chef prepare
a bucket of your finest caviar,

492
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,163
and then give it
a helicopter tour of the city.

493
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:24,197
Very good, sir.

494
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:25,732
Very good indeed.

495
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,702
I hope it enjoys it as much as
that Maine lobster I ordered.

496
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,171
And over there is the
Rhode Island State House,

497
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,440
the second largest
self-supporting marble dome

498
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:34,875
in North America.

499
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:36,443
Why the (bleep)
am I doing this?

500
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,045
I could've just
said I did it.

501
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:39,780
Sir, about
your bill...

502
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:41,381
Oh, don't worry, Carstairs,

503
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:43,517
there's ample gratuity
on there for you.

504
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:44,885
(chuckles):
Nyah.

505
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:47,688
Well, actually, sir, your
card has been declined.

506
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:49,122
(laughs):
Oh, really?

507
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,541
Well, I'm sure a brief call
to my accountant

508
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,744
will resolve this
to our mutual satisfaction.

509
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:56,980
Hello, Schnozzenstein?

510
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:58,382
This is Peter Griffin.

511
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,384
There seems to be
some issue with our credit.

512
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:03,253
I told Carstairs
you'd set everything straight.

513
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:04,755
What do you mean I'm broke?!

514
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:07,107
What about all that money
I sent to the Gayman Islands?

515
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:08,909
They did what with it?!

516
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:11,011
No, I don't want it back!

517
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,729
I'm gonna miss you,
Carstairs.

518
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:15,265
I shall miss
you, too, sir.

519
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,950
With no one to look after,

520
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:18,785
Carstairs fell into
a deep depression

521
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:20,554
from which he never emerged.

522
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:22,389
He died two weeks later.

523
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:24,024
Some say of a broken heart.

524
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:25,025
What, sir?

525
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:26,326
But that was Carstairs.

526
00:18:29,897 --> 00:18:31,381
I can't believe it.

527
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,716
We lost everything.

528
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:34,317
What do we do now?

529
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:36,586
Well, seems like our
only hope is the lottery.

530
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:39,723
Holy (bleep), we won twice and
we're right back here again.

531
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,160
We had $150 million, and
we blew through it in a month.

532
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:45,345
Yeah, but on the bright side,
if this hadn't happened,

533
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,480
we never would've met Kyle.

534
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:48,148
Hey.

535
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:49,182
Hello. Hey there.
Hi. What's up?

536
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,751
And that's not even Kyle.

537
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:52,285
Peter, we can't
live like this.

538
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:54,004
Well, what are we
supposed to do, Lois?

539
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:55,205
Everything we
had is gone!

540
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:56,823
We have friends, Peter.

541
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:58,108
Not anymore, we don't.

542
00:18:58,176 --> 00:18:59,342
They're good people.

543
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,444
They'll listen.

544
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,145
And they'll care
what happens to us,

545
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:04,915
even after everything
that's happened.

546
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:07,217
You know, I'm still young
enough you can drop me

547
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:09,052
at the fire station,
no questions asked.

548
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:19,429
Well, well.
Look who it is.

549
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:20,397
Who is it?

550
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:21,515
It's me, Peter.

551
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:22,449
I'm standing
right here.

552
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:23,950
This is a glass eye, Peter.

553
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:25,719
They had to remove
the one you shot.

554
00:19:25,787 --> 00:19:28,188
Oh, boy, that whole
day was a mess, huh?

555
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:29,956
What happened to you, anyway?
You look terrible.

556
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:32,392
Look, you guys,
I messed up bad.

557
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,394
Winning the lottery
was the worst thing

558
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:36,296
that ever happened
to me and my family.

559
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:38,832
I thought being rich
would solve all my problems,

560
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,935
but all it did was make me
forget what was important.

561
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:44,070
Like who my real friends are.

562
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:45,822
I don't expect
you to forgive me,

563
00:19:45,907 --> 00:19:49,409
but if, for some reason, you do,
you can find me

564
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,111
in a cardboard box on the corner
of Meeting and Thayer.

565
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,165
Peter, wait.

566
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,718
That corner's
a bit of a hike for me.

567
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:00,303
I'd rather just
come see you at home.

568
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:05,158
What-- where'd you get
this kind of money?

569
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:07,727
The penis enlargement pill you
gave me the startup money for.

570
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:09,246
It turned a pretty nice profit.

571
00:20:09,313 --> 00:20:11,681
I guess it's only fair
that I give you my percentage

572
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:13,400
so you can get your house back.

573
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:17,170
Quagmire, I don't know
what to say.

574
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:18,305
Thank you.

575
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:19,689
You're welcome.

576
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:21,708
And if it makes you feel better,
it was money well spent.

577
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,260
Just ask Sandra
the waitress over there.

578
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:24,878
We had a great time
last night.

579
00:20:24,946 --> 00:20:26,513
PETER:
Tough girl.

580
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:27,881
Made it into work.

581
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,919
Boy, I got to say,
it's good to be home.

582
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,754
Yeah. Despite all
the ups and downs,

583
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:36,389
things turned out for the best.

584
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:39,059
I mean, really, we're no worse
off than we were before.

585
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:40,727
Plus, we learned something.

586
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:42,562
And you can't
put a price on that.

587
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,964
Look, Lois, we all know
what happened.

588
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:45,164
We're all depressed.

589
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:46,883
All right, let's just
go to different rooms

590
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:48,785
and stare blankly
out the window, saying nothing.

591
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:52,853

592
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,879
Congratulations to
tonight's sweepstakes winner,

593
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:00,831
Daniel San Martin Marrero.

594
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:02,032
MODEL: Shapes.
Shut up.
