Peter, what's
going on?

17
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:37,732
What's going on, Lois,
is that this girl

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,518
is obviously not well,
and I have just learned

19
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:42,153
that she's been stealing
from the show,

20
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:45,557
and she should probably
be escorted out of the building.

For what?

33
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:22,243
I've decided I want to open
a sushi restaurant.

34
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:23,445
What do you know
about sushi?

35
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:24,929
I don't care
about the sushi.

36
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:27,415
I just want to yell at customers
when they walk in the door.

Here comes a black guy!

anything else.

40

We're running seriously
low on cash right now.

00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:42,197
In fact, I may have to
get my own full-time job.

42
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:44,416
Geez. Are we really living
that close to the edge?

43
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:45,700
You know we
are, Brian.

44
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:47,435
Why do you think
we waited so long

45
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:49,137
to take you to the
groomer's last month?

46
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:54,726
Hey, isn't it time for me
to get a haircut?

47
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:57,028
Oh, no. I think
you just got one.

48
00:01:57,096 --> 00:01:58,363
Are you sure?

49
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:00,365
'Cause I feel like
my nails are really long.

50
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,066
Yeah, I'll check,
but I'm pretty sure

51
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:03,818
it's not for another
couple of weeks.

Okay. Our top

The Rhode Island
State Lottery

60
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:22,153
has climbed to a record
$150 million jackpot.

00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,521
That's right, Tom.

Powerball fever has
officially gripped Quahog.

63
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,259
We sent Channel Five News
Asian correspondent

64
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:31,229
Tricia Takanawa around town
to get the public reaction.

65
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:34,632
Mayor West, what do you plan
to do if you win the lottery?

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,835
Well, I'd finally
splurge and buy myself

67
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:39,537
one of those fancy
four-piece suits.

68
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:41,473
I'd like to join
your country club.

69
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,875
I assume that won't
be a problem.

70
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:47,512
And how about you,
every Persian guy in the world?

71
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,848
White BMW.

72
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:50,915
There you go, Lois.

73
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:52,083
That's the answer right there.

74
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:53,685
We'll just win the lottery.

75
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:56,254
In fact, I'm going to go buy
my winning ticket right now.

76
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:02,310
Peter, what's wrong?

77
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:03,478
It's, uh, nothing.

78
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:05,396
I'm just going
to wait a minute.

79
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:07,899
There's teenagers
in skinny jeans out there.

80
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:14,172
Everyone, I got big news.

81
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,108
We are going
to be rich.

82
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:18,660
Oh, my God, Peter.

83
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,662
There are thousands of
lottery tickets here.

84
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:22,664
Where did you get the
money for all these?

85
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:24,999
Simple. I took out a second
mortgage on the house.

86
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,885
What?!
Peter, this is idiotic.

87
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:29,003
Your odds of winning
are like 100 million to one.

88
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:31,940
Don't you know the lottery
is just a tax on stupid people?

89
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:33,591
Would you be saying
that if the prize

90
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,960
was 150 million bags of
the neighbor's garbage?

91
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:37,061
But it's not.

92
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,429
I mean... I mean, is it?

93
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:40,615
It's... that-that is an
unrealistic, unfair question.

94
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:41,966
Peter, Brian's right.

95
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:43,868
How can you be
so irresponsible?

96
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:45,520
You take these tickets
back right now.

97
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:46,554
No way, Lois.

98
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:47,755
We're going to win.

99
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:49,457
I got lots of good
karma built up

100
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:50,909
from doing those
USO shows.

101
00:03:52,244 --> 00:03:53,862
So, apparently, they found

102
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,997
a weapon of mass destruction--
my putter.

103
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:00,451
All right, boys.
Go get 'em over there.

104

135
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:09,068
Okay, I don't know
what she's doing now.

136
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:10,269
Somebody turn the machine off.

137

A static shot of the house
where night turns into day

161
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:01,485

162
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:03,037
Well, that's it.

163
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:06,274
Three days wasted looking
through 200,000 lottery tickets.

164
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:07,742
Those weren't
the lottery tickets.

165
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,277
That was a test.

166
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:11,296
These are
the lottery tickets.

167
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:14,866
Is this another test?

168
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:16,167
Yes.

169
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:17,769
These aren't the real
lottery tickets, either.

170
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,188
These are the real
lottery tickets.

171
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:23,641
So, in addition to buying
200,000 lottery tickets,

172
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:26,110
you had 400,000 fake ones
printed up?

173
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,980
I had to be sure.

174
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,333
Oh, my God. We won!

175
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:33,718
What?
Let me see that.

176
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:36,921
Yes! We won the lottery!

177
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:38,323
I'm getting a penis butler.

178
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:39,507
Sir?

179
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,392
All right, butle
my penis. Butle it!

180
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:47,938
This is awesome.

181
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:49,172
Now that we're rich,

182
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,007
our lives are going
to be so much better.

183
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:52,642
You sure it was
such a good idea

184
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,111
to cash that
lottery check?

185
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:56,513
It seems foolish to have
all this money lying around.

186
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:58,448
Oh, you'd rather have
it down at the bank

187
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:00,050
where the Jewish
guys can leer at it?

188
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,735
Yeah!
All right!

189
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:02,836
Money!

190
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:04,237
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

191
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:06,540
Hello?

192
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,308
Did you blow all your money yet?
No, Daddy.

193
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:09,876
All right. Call me
when you blow all your money.

194
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:11,344
Love you. Bye.

195
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:13,080
All right, so how are we
going to spend our winnings?

196
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:14,681
I'm going to get some
supermarket fried chicken

197
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:16,683
and eat it until I'm nauseous.

198
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:19,569
I'm going to finally get my gal
that doodad she's been wantin'!

199
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,671
I'm going to get a floor mirror
to squat over

200
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,540
and see what's making
all that noise.

201
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:25,342
Okay, everybody
just calm down.

202
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:27,210
We're not going to go crazy
spending our winnings,

203
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:29,246
and we're not going to let
this money change us.

204
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:30,714
What are you talking about?

205
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:33,083
This money is our ticket
to the good life, starting now.

206
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:35,619
I just bought a giant room
full of gold coins,

207
00:07:35,686 --> 00:07:38,121
and I'm going to dive into it
like Scrooge McDuck.

208
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,427
Aah! It's not a liquid!

209
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:47,731
It's a great many pieces
of solid matter

210
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:50,267
that form a hard,
floor-like surface!

211
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,701
Aah!

212
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:58,024
Peter, what are you
doing here?

213
00:07:58,092 --> 00:07:59,459
Shouldn't you
be at work?

214
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:00,961
I quit my job, Lois.

215
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:02,662
You what?
Yeah, we're rich now.

216
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,064
I don't need to be working.

217
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,298
Ah, you should've
been there, Lois.

218
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:07,400
I told Angela what she could do
with that job,

219
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:09,369
just like I always fantasized.

220
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:11,004
Angela, I just want
to thank you

221
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:13,106
for several extremely
pleasurable years

222
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:14,407
working for this
corporation.

223
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:16,710
Uh, certain
unexpected developments

224
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:18,311
have created
a situation

225
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,547
where I am no longer
in need of employment.

226
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,382
Uh, I would be
remiss, however,

227
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,684
if I did not extend
my gratitude to you

228
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:27,187
for your unwavering
fairness and belief in me,

229
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:29,356
and there is a giant poo
on your desk.

230
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:34,544
Hey, Horace,
another round for everybody.

231
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:38,481
Gosh, Peter,
you're really

232
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,616
being generous
with your money.

233
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,151
Hey, what's the point
of being rich

234
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,053
if you can't share it
with your pals, huh?

235
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,337
Okay, wait,
I-I got one.

236
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:45,739
Who would you
rather do?

237
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:47,574
Susan Boyle
or a sex doll

238
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:49,593
that's been passed
around a fraternity?

239
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,061
Well, have they been
cleaning the doll?

240
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,313
Please, these guys are Betas--
they're total animals.

241
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:54,447
Hey, I got
one, Peter.

242
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:55,649
What would you
rather do?

243
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:57,284
Tread water where
you are right now

244
00:08:57,351 --> 00:08:59,119
or increase your
net worth fivefold

245
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:00,453
within the next
18 months?

246
00:09:00,521 --> 00:09:01,588
Huh?

247
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:03,190
What? I... what are you
talking about?

248
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:05,325
Well, my friend Marty
is a whiz with chemistry,

249
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:06,793
and he says
he's come up

250
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:08,378
with a new penis
enlargement pill,

251
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:11,498
and if we can bankroll him
$100,000 in startup money,

252
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:13,400
he'll triple our
investment in a year.

253
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:16,036
Well, uh...
gee, I-I'm... I don't, uh...

254
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:17,437
Peter, I've taken
the liberty

255
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:19,372
of mocking up some
sales projections.

256
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,874
Wow, that's pretty good.

257
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,876
And this would be
our net profits.

258
00:09:22,944 --> 00:09:24,077
Yikes.

259
00:09:24,145 --> 00:09:25,579
You know, Peter, uh,

260
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:28,915
Bonnie's birthday is coming up,
and I'll be gol-darned

261
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:31,718
if I didn't go ahead and
promise her that Stevie Nicks

262
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:34,721
would come to our house
and sing three songs to her.

263
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:38,058
Boy, do I got a big mouth, huh?

264
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,327
Yeah, if you're going to open
your mouth with the missus,

265
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:41,595
stick to kisses, huh?

266
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,900
What neat humor.
What neat humor.

267
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:49,236
So what do say, Peter?
Can you help us out?

268
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,704
Of course I can, you dope.

269
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,422
We're pals, right?

270
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:56,192
There you go.

271
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,227
Hey, Horace,
give us

272
00:09:57,295 --> 00:09:58,528
three shots
of your best bourbon.

273
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:00,914
And have that Russian waiter
I like bring it over.

00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:43,223
that all his kids
were stillborn, huh?

290
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,525
All right, well,
thanks again, Peter.

291
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:46,993
I got to head out.

292
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:48,962
I told my mother I'd visit
her in the hospital.

293
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,413
Yeah, and I got to work.

294
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:51,881
I'm flying a leg
to Minneapolis tonight.

295
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:53,216
Oh.

296
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,517
Yeah, I-I-I understand.

297
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:55,785
You... you've got
other things to do.

298
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:57,387
I-I just wrote you guys
a couple of checks,

299
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,072
but no, you... you-you-you
do your things.

300
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,907
What?
No, I mean, I-I'm just saying,

301
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:03,310
I-I thought friends hang out,
do things with each other.

302
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:04,928
You know,
especially when one friend

303
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:07,347
gives the other friends
a whole bunch of money.

304
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:10,934
Oh. Well, I guess I
could stick around.

305
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:14,037
Yeah, and I-I guess
the co-pilot can fly the plane.

306
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,940
She's a woman and passengers
are usually okay with that.

307
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,308
I once saw a
deodorant commercial

308
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:19,642
that had a
woman pilot.

309
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,261
That's more like it.

310
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,780
From now on, we're all gonna do
whatever I want to do.

311
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,131
'Cause I'm the one
with the dough.

312
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:26,833
Okay, I guess that's fair.

313
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,568
Good.
'Cause what I want to do is

314
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,637
stay here, get drunk
and watch TV.

315
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:33,807
We now return to <i>Michael</i>
<i>McDonald During Allergy Season.</i>

316
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:35,742
Haa...

317
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,061
Haa-haa...

318
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:40,146
Haa-haa-haa-haa-haa...

319
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,614
Haa...

320
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,099
♪ Haa-chu! ♪

321
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:48,004
Hey, Peter, you wanted me
to watch the entire first season

322
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:50,607
of <i>True Blood</i> and come show you
where there was boob?

323
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:52,075
That's right, I
don't want to see

324
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,410
any actual <i>True</i>
<i>Blood,</i> just boob.

325
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:54,677
Yeah, well, I found some.

326
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:58,765
No!

327
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,234
Anna Paquin boob does
not count as real boob!

328
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:03,470
That's like looking
at a 12-year-old boy.

329
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:05,572
Geez. Y-You should
know that, Joe!

330
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,673
You should
definitely know that!

331
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:08,041
Sorry, Peter.

332
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,043
Sorry doesn't show me
nipples worth seeing!

333
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,879
And as for you, Anna, you're
dreadful and so is the program.

334
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:14,080
I didn't write it.

335
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:15,782
Yeah, but you know
the people who do.

336
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,384
That Alan Ball--
you know him, right?

337
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:18,418
Yeah.

338
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:19,519
How come everything
he writes

339
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:21,421
is so dreary?
I don't know.

340
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:23,156
Tell him to cheer up!
Things ain't so bad!

341
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:25,625
This is a weird episode.

342
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:29,662
Okay, Quagmire, I want you
to take the first bite

343
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,030
out of this fudge pop,

344
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:33,466
because that first bite
is the one that really hurts.

345
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:35,902
Well, okay.

346
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,691
Ah! Ow!

347
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,692
Ow!

348
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Yeah, that's right "Ow."

349
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:44,861
Now, you swallow that.

350
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:46,162
Don't you dare spit that out.

351
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,113
What's the
difference?

352
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:48,031
You got what
you wanted.

353
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,048
I said swallow it!

354
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:51,768
Now, smear what's
left of it on your face

355
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:55,688
and look at me
with your mouth open.

356
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:57,891
Look at yourself,
you filthy whore.

357
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:02,195
I don't even
want this now.

358
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:09,369
Okay, guys, now you're gonna do
a synchronized duet

359
00:13:09,437 --> 00:13:11,938
of "Makin' Whoopee" while
I shoot you with this BB gun.

360
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:12,972
That doesn't
sound safe.

361
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,807

Relax, Joe.

376
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:44,637
I'm nowhere near your eye.

377
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:46,105
Hey, Joe, open your eye.

378
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,942
Gotcha.

379
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:50,910
What the hell, Peter?!
You shot him in the eye!

380
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,378
Keep singing, you.
And keep your chin up,

381
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:53,613
so I can see your throat.

382
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,398
No, no screw this!
You're a jerk!

383
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,200
Jerk? What kind of a way is that

384
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:59,035
to talk to your friend
who gives you money?

385
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:00,136
Go to hell, Peter!

386
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:01,337
We don't need
your money!

387
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:02,839
And we don't need
friends like you!

388
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:04,207
Yeah! We're out of here!

389
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:05,475
Fine, go on. I don't care.

390
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,310
I don't need you, I got money!

391
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,646
You know, Peter,
you used to be a great guy.

392
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:11,247
But ever since
you won that lottery...

393
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:14,517
Come on, Joe!

394
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:16,319
this guy!
Aah!

395
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:21,691
I'm here to audition
for <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

396
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,092
Come right in.

397
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:33,860
Peter, my God, what the
hell are you wearing?

398
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:35,978
It's a solid gold
tuxedo, Lois.

399
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:37,447
I had to fight three rappers

400
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:39,348
down at the Nonsense Store
for this.

401
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,150
Look, Peter, this
is not who we are.

402
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:43,252
I'm worried the money
is changing this family,

403
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,754
and not the
way you hoped.

404
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:47,089
Well, I was hoping it would make
you shut up, so you're right.

405
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:48,891
You know, I spoke to
Bonnie this morning,

406
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,861
and she said you haven't talked
to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks.

407
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:53,412
Who cares?
I don't need Quagmire.

408
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,114
And I certainly don't need Joe.

409
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:56,415
I got Money Joe.

410
00:14:57,468 --> 00:14:58,801
That's a good one, Money Joe!

411
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:00,970
I don't like what this money
is doing to us.

412
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:03,072
It's even affecting
Brian and Stewie.

413
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:05,374
I think I'm gonna
take a nap.

414
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:07,577
What, here?
Yeah, I had a giant mobile

415
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:09,996
put in the sky so I can
sleep wherever I want.

416
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,851
This is nice.

417
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:17,169
I hope that bear
comes around soon.

418
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:19,772
That's sort of my fave--
Oh, look, the bear!

419
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,290
And it's not just them.

420
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:24,260
Chris has also been developing
some very expensive tastes.

421
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:26,596
Model glue, sir?

422
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,314
Well, what do
we have today?

423
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:31,467
Today we have a recent vintage
procured just this morning

424
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:33,219
from Michael's Hobby Shop.

425
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:35,288
Yes, that's
very nice.

426
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:37,256
Bring me my
finest rag.

427
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:39,075
Your fancy rag, sir.

428
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,927
You are relieved
for the evening.

429
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:49,185
You don't see
poor people doing this!

430
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:50,419
Lois, don't you understand?

431
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:52,688
We don't got any of
our old problems anymore.

432
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:54,624
We don't have to worry
about paying bills,

433
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:56,509
we don't have to worry
about saving dough.

434
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:58,978
All we got to do
is enjoy ourselves.

435
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:00,062
Interested?

436
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:05,234
Oh, my God.

437
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,571
Peter, it's
beautiful!

438
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,872
Is it a blood
diamond?

439
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,307
Ah, the bloodiest.

440
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,976
The two kids who found it were
forced to murder each other.

441
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:15,811
Oh, Peter,
I love it.

442
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,748
Hey, you want to watch a DVD
of the murder while we do it?

443
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:20,032
I already watched it
eight times,

444
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,235
so I know exactly
which part I want to blam at.

445
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:27,873
Chris, Meg, now that
I'm a rich father,

446
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:30,376
you will try to impress me,
and I will remain distant.

447
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:31,477
Go.

448
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:33,579
Um, say, Dad,
did I tell you

449
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,748
I got second place
in the yacht race?

450
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:38,017
Hmm. Sounds like
somebody's dad

451
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:39,685
is happier than
me right now.

452
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:41,387
Well, um, how about this, Dad?

453
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:43,522
The school paper is
doing a story about me.

454
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,324
That's because I
had it arranged.

455
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:48,160
Uh, I was thinking about
joining the Army?

456
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:49,428
No.

457
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:51,430
Meg, as a girl, your
life holds no merit.

458
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:53,666
And, Chris, try as you
may, you will never be

459
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,534
as good as your older
brother who died.

460
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:57,236
He was good at
sports and talking.

461
00:16:57,287 --> 00:16:59,155
Now, pardon me
while I look at scrimshaw

462
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:00,923
through a magnifying glass.

463
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:03,426
Ah, brave men all.

464
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:05,394
Lost sons of New Bedford.

465
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:07,063
That's good scrimshaw.

466
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,735
Ah, I never thought
I'd be having high tea

467
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:15,004
at the Park Barrington
every single day.

468
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:17,773
Yes, it's nice to eat in a sea
of white faces, isn't it?

469
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:21,110
Waiter, have the chef prepare
a bucket of your finest caviar,

470
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:23,162
and then give it
a helicopter tour of the city.

471
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,196
Very good, sir.

472
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:25,731
Very good indeed.

473
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,701
I hope it enjoys it as much as
that Maine lobster I ordered.

474
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:31,170
And over there is the
Rhode Island State House,

475
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:33,439
the second largest
self-supporting marble dome

476
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:34,874
in North America.

477
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:36,442
Why the
am I doing this?

478
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,044
I could've just
said I did it.

479
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:39,779
Sir, about
your bill...

480
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,380
Oh, don't worry, Carstairs,

481
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:43,516
there's ample gratuity
on there for you.

482
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,884
Nyah.

483
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:47,687
Well, actually, sir, your
card has been declined.

484
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:49,121
Oh, really?

485
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:51,540
Well, I'm sure a brief call
to my accountant

486
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:53,743
will resolve this
to our mutual satisfaction.

487
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:56,979
Hello, Schnozzenstein?

488
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:58,381
This is Peter Griffin.

489
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:00,383
There seems to be
some issue with our credit.

490
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,252
I told Carstairs
you'd set everything straight.

491
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,754
What do you mean I'm broke?!

492
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:07,106
What about all that money
I sent to the Gayman Islands?

493
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:08,908
They did what with it?!

494
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:11,010
No, I don't want it back!

495
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:12,728
I'm gonna miss you,
Carstairs.

496
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:15,264
I shall miss
you, too, sir.

497
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:16,949
With no one to look after,

498
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:18,784
Carstairs fell into
a deep depression

499
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:20,553
from which he never emerged.

500
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,388
He died two weeks later.

501
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:24,023
Some say of a broken heart.

502
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:25,024
What, sir?

503
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:26,325
But that was Carstairs.

504
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:31,380
I can't believe it.

505
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:32,715
We lost everything.

506
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:34,316
What do we do now?

507
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:36,585
Well, seems like our
only hope is the lottery.

508
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:39,722
Holy (bleep), we won twice and
we're right back here again.

509
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,159
We had $150 million, and
we blew through it in a month.

510
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:45,344
Yeah, but on the bright side,
if this hadn't happened,

511
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:46,479
we never would've met Kyle.

512
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:48,147
Hey.

513
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:49,181
Hello. Hey there.
Hi. What's up?

514
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:50,750
And that's not even Kyle.

515
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,284
Peter, we can't
live like this.

516
00:18:52,352 --> 00:18:54,003
Well, what are we
supposed to do, Lois?

517
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,204
Everything we
had is gone!

518
00:18:55,272 --> 00:18:56,822
We have friends, Peter.

519
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,107
Not anymore, we don't.

520
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,341
They're good people.

521
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:00,443
They'll listen.

522
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,144
And they'll care
what happens to us,

523
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:04,914
even after everything
that's happened.

524
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:07,216
You know, I'm still young
enough you can drop me

525
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:09,051
at the fire station,
no questions asked.

526
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:19,428
Well, well.
Look who it is.

527
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:20,396
Who is it?

528
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:21,514
It's me, Peter.

529
00:19:21,581 --> 00:19:22,448
I'm standing
right here.

530
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:23,949
This is a glass eye, Peter.

531
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:25,718
They had to remove
the one you shot.

532
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:28,187
Oh, boy, that whole
day was a mess, huh?

533
00:19:28,255 --> 00:19:29,955
What happened to you, anyway?
You look terrible.

534
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:32,391
Look, you guys,
I messed up bad.

535
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,393
Winning the lottery
was the worst thing

536
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:36,295
that ever happened
to me and my family.

537
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:38,831
I thought being rich
would solve all my problems,

538
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:41,934
but all it did was make me
forget what was important.

539
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:44,069
Like who my real friends are.

540
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:45,821
I don't expect
you to forgive me,

541
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:49,408
but if, for some reason, you do,
you can find me

542
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:52,110
in a cardboard box on the corner
of Meeting and Thayer.

543
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,164
Peter, wait.

544
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,717
That corner's
a bit of a hike for me.

545
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:00,302
I'd rather just
come see you at home.

546
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:05,157
What-- where'd you get
this kind of money?

547
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:07,726
The penis enlargement pill you
gave me the startup money for.

548
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:09,245
It turned a pretty nice profit.

549
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,680
I guess it's only fair
that I give you my percentage

550
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:13,399
so you can get your house back.

551
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:17,169
Quagmire, I don't know
what to say.

552
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:18,304
Thank you.

553
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:19,688
You're welcome.

554
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,707
And if it makes you feel better,
it was money well spent.

555
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:23,259
Just ask Sandra
the waitress over there.

556
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:24,877
We had a great time
last night.

557
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:26,512
Tough girl.

558
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,880
Made it into work.

559
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:32,918
Boy, I got to say,
it's good to be home.

560
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,753
Yeah. Despite all
the ups and downs,

561
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:36,388
things turned out for the best.

562
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:39,058
I mean, really, we're no worse
off than we were before.

563
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,726
Plus, we learned something.

564
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,561
And you can't
put a price on that.

565
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:43,963
Look, Lois, we all know
what happened.

566
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,163
We're all depressed.

567
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:46,882
All right, let's just
go to different rooms

568
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,784
and stare blankly
out the window, saying nothing.

569

570
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,878
Congratulations to
tonight's sweepstakes winner,

571
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:00,830
Daniel San Martin Marrero.

572
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:02,031
Shapes.
Shut up.
