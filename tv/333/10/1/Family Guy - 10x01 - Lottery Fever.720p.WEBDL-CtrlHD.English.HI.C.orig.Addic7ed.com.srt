Peter, what's
going on?

17
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:38,073
What's going on, Lois,
is that this girl

18
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:40,859
is obviously not well,
and I have just learned

19
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:42,494
that she's been stealing
from the show,

20
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:45,898
and she should probably
be escorted out of the building.

For what?

34
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:23,452
I've decided I want to open
a sushi restaurant.

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,654
What do you know
about sushi?

36
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,138
I don't care
about the sushi.

37
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:28,624
I just want to yell at customers
when they walk in the door.

We're running seriously
low on cash right now.

43

In fact, I may have to
get my own full-time job.

44
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,625
Geez. Are we really living
that close to the edge?

45
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:46,909
You know we
are, Brian.

46
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:48,644
Why do you think
we waited so long

47
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:50,346
to take you to the
groomer's last month?

48
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,935
Hey, isn't it time for me
to get a haircut?

49
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,237
Oh, no. I think
you just got one.

50
00:01:58,305 --> 00:01:59,572
Are you sure?

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,574
'Cause I feel like
my nails are really long.

52

Yeah, I'll check,
but I'm pretty sure

it's not for another

The Rhode Island
State Lottery

63
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,362
has climbed to a record
$150 million jackpot.

That's right, Tom.

Tricia Takanawa around town
to get the public reaction.

68
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:35,841
Mayor West, what do you plan
to do if you win the lottery?

69
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,044
Well, I'd finally
splurge and buy myself

70
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:40,746
one of those fancy
four-piece suits.

71
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:42,682
I'd like to join
your country club.

72
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:45,084
I assume that won't
be a problem.

73
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:48,721
And how about you,
every Persian guy in the world?

ALL:
White BMW.

75
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:52,124
There you go, Lois.

76
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:53,292
That's the answer right there.

77
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:54,894
We'll just win the lottery.

78
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:57,463
In fact, I'm going to go buy
my winning ticket right now.

79
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:03,519
Peter, what's wrong?

80
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:04,687
It's, uh, nothing.

81
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:06,605
I'm just going
to wait a minute.

82
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:09,108
There's teenagers
in skinny jeans out there.

We are going

00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:19,869
Oh, my God, Peter.

86
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,871
There are thousands of
lottery tickets here.

87
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,873
Where did you get the
money for all these?

88
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,208
Simple. I took out a second
mortgage on the house.

89
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:28,094
What?!
Peter, this is idiotic.

90
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:30,212
Your odds of winning
are like 100 million to one.

91
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,149
Don't you know the lottery
is just a tax on stupid people?

92
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:34,800
Would you be saying
that if the prize

93
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:37,169
was 150 million bags of
the neighbor's garbage?

94
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:38,270
But it's not.

95
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:39,638
I mean... I mean, is it?

96
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,824
It's... that-that is an
unrealistic, unfair question.

97
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:43,175
Peter, Brian's right.

98
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:45,077
How can you be
so irresponsible?

99
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,729
You take these tickets
back right now.

100
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:47,763

101
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:48,964
We're going to win.

102
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:50,666
I got lots of good
karma built up

103

105
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:55,071

106
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:57,206
a weapon of mass destruction--
my putter.

170

Well, that's it.

171
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:06,572
Three days wasted looking
through 200,000 lottery tickets.

172
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,040
Those weren't
the lottery tickets.

173
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,575
That was a test.

174
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:11,594
These are
the lottery tickets.

175
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,164
Is this another test?

176
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:16,465
Yes.

177
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,067
These aren't the real
lottery tickets, either.

178
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:20,486
These are the real
lottery tickets.

179
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,939
So, in addition to buying
200,000 lottery tickets,

180
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,408
you had 400,000 fake ones
printed up?

181
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:29,278
I had to be sure.

182
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:32,631
Oh, my God. We won!

183
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,016
What?
Let me see that.

184
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:37,219
Yes! We won the lottery!

185
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:38,621
I'm getting a penis butler.

186
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:39,805
Sir?

187
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:41,690
All right, butle
my penis. Butle it!

188
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,338
This is awesome.

189
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:49,572
Now that we're rich,

190
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,407
our lives are going
to be so much better.

191
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,042
You sure it was
such a good idea

192
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,511
to cash that
lottery check?

193
00:06:54,578 --> 00:06:56,913
It seems foolish to have
all this money lying around.

194
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,848
Oh, you'd rather have
it down at the bank

195
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,450
where the Jewish
guys can leer at it?

196
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:02,135
Yeah!
All right!

197
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:03,236
Money!
(whistling)

198
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:04,637
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

199
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:06,940
(phone rings)
Hello?

200
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,708
CARTER: Did you blow all your money yet?
No, Daddy.

201
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,276
All right. Call me
when you blow all your money.

202
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:11,744
Love you. Bye.

203
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,480
All right, so how are we
going to spend our winnings?

204
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:15,081
I'm going to get some
supermarket fried chicken

205
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:17,083
and eat it until I'm nauseous.

206
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:19,969
I'm going to finally get my gal
that doodad she's been wantin'!

207
00:07:20,037 --> 00:07:22,071
I'm going to get a floor mirror
to squat over

208
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,940
and see what's making
all that noise.

209
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,742
Okay, everybody
just calm down.

210
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,610
We're not going to go crazy
spending our winnings,

211
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:29,646
and we're not going to let
this money change us.

212
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:31,114
What are you talking about?

213
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:33,483
This money is our ticket
to the good life, starting now.

214
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:36,019
I just bought a giant room
full of gold coins,

215
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:38,521
and I'm going to dive into it
like Scrooge McDuck.

216
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:40,123
(drumroll)

217
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,827
Aah! It's not a liquid!

218
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,131
It's a great many pieces
of solid matter

219
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,667
that form a hard,
floor-like surface!

220
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:52,101
Aah!

221
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:58,424
Peter, what are you
doing here?

222
00:07:58,492 --> 00:07:59,859
Shouldn't you
be at work?

223
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,361
I quit my job, Lois.

224
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:03,062
You what?
Yeah, we're rich now.

225
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,464
I don't need to be working.

226
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:05,698
Ah, you should've
been there, Lois.

227
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:07,800
I told Angela what she could do
with that job,

228
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:09,769
just like I always fantasized.

229
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,404
Angela, I just want
to thank you

230
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:13,506
for several extremely
pleasurable years

231
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:14,807
working for this
corporation.

232
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,110
Uh, certain
unexpected developments

233
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:18,711
have created
a situation

234
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,947
where I am no longer
in need of employment.

235
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:22,782
Uh, I would be
remiss, however,

236
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,084
if I did not extend
my gratitude to you

237
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:27,587
for your unwavering
fairness and belief in me,

238
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:29,756
and there is a giant poo
on your desk.

239
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:34,944
Hey, Horace,
another round for everybody.

240
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:37,664
(patrons cheering)

241
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:38,881
Gosh, Peter,
you're really

242
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:40,016
being generous
with your money.

243
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:41,551
Hey, what's the point
of being rich

244
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:43,453
if you can't share it
with your pals, huh?

245
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,737
Okay, wait,
I-I got one.

246
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:46,139
Who would you
rather do?

247
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:47,974
Susan Boyle
or a sex doll

248
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:49,993
that's been passed
around a fraternity?

249
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,461
Well, have they been
cleaning the doll?

250
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:53,713
Please, these guys are Betas--
they're total animals.

251
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:54,847
Hey, I got
one, Peter.

252
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:56,049
What would you
rather do?

253
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:57,684
Tread water where
you are right now

254
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:59,519
or increase your
net worth fivefold

255
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:00,853
within the next
18 months?

256
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:01,988
Huh?

257
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:03,590
What? I... what are you
talking about?

258
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:05,725
Well, my friend Marty
is a whiz with chemistry,

259
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:07,193
and he says
he's come up

260
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,778
with a new penis
enlargement pill,

261
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:11,898
and if we can bankroll him
$100,000 in startup money,

262
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:13,800
he'll triple our
investment in a year.

263
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:16,436
Well, uh...
gee, I-I'm... I don't, uh...

264
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:17,837
Peter, I've taken
the liberty

265
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:19,772
of mocking up some
sales projections.

266
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,274
Wow, that's pretty good.

267
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:23,276
And this would be
our net profits.

268
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:24,477
Yikes.

269
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:25,979
You know, Peter, uh,

270
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:29,315
Bonnie's birthday is coming up,
and I'll be gol-darned

271
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:32,118
if I didn't go ahead and
promise her that Stevie Nicks

272
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:35,121
would come to our house
and sing three songs to her.

273
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:38,458
(chuckling):
Boy, do I got a big mouth, huh?

274
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:40,727
Yeah, if you're going to open
your mouth with the missus,

275
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:41,995
stick to kisses, huh?
(laughs)

276
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:45,098
(both laughing)

277
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:47,300
What neat humor.
What neat humor.

278
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:49,636
So what do say, Peter?
Can you help us out?

279
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:51,104
Of course I can, you dope.

280
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:52,822
We're pals, right?

281
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:56,592
There you go.

282
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,627
Hey, Horace,
give us

283
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:58,928
three shots
of your best bourbon.

284
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:01,314
And have that Russian waiter
I like bring it over.

285
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:03,032

that all his kids
were stillborn, huh?

302
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:45,925
All right, well,
thanks again, Peter.

303
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:47,393
I got to head out.

304
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:49,362
I told my mother I'd visit
her in the hospital.

305
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,813
Yeah, and I got to work.

306
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:52,281
I'm flying a leg
to Minneapolis tonight.

307
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:53,616
Oh.

308
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,917
Yeah, I-I-I understand.

309
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:56,185
You... you've got
other things to do.

310
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:57,787
I-I just wrote you guys
a couple of checks,

311
00:10:57,855 --> 00:10:59,472
but no, you... you-you-you
do your things.

312
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,307
What?
No, I mean, I-I'm just saying,

313
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,710
I-I thought friends hang out,
do things with each other.

314
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:05,328
You know,
especially when one friend

315
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:07,747
gives the other friends
a whole bunch of money.

316
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:11,334
Oh. Well, I guess I
could stick around.

317
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:14,437
Yeah, and I-I guess
the co-pilot can fly the plane.

318
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:17,340
She's a woman and passengers
are usually okay with that.

319
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:18,708
I once saw a
deodorant commercial

320
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:20,042
that had a
woman pilot.

321
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,661
That's more like it.

322
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:24,180
From now on, we're all gonna do
whatever I want to do.

323
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:25,531
'Cause I'm the one
with the dough.

324
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,233
Okay, I guess that's fair.

325
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:28,968
Good.
'Cause what I want to do is

326
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:31,037
stay here, get drunk
and watch TV.

327
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:34,207
ANNOUNCER: We now return to <i>Michael</i>
<i>McDonald During Allergy Season.</i>

328
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:36,142
(gasping):
Haa...

329
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,461
Haa-haa...

330
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:40,546
Haa-haa-haa-haa-haa...

331
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:42,014
Haa...

332
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:43,499
(sneezes):
♪ Haa-chu! ♪

333
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:48,404
Hey, Peter, you wanted me
to watch the entire first season

334
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:51,007
of <i>True Blood</i> and come show you
where there was boob?

335
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:52,475
That's right, I
don't want to see

336
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:53,810
any actual <i>True</i>
<i>Blood,</i> just boob.

337
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:55,077
Yeah, well, I found some.

338
00:11:57,931 --> 00:11:59,165
No!

339
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,634
Anna Paquin boob does
not count as real boob!

340
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:03,870
That's like looking
at a 12-year-old boy.

341
00:12:03,937 --> 00:12:05,972
Geez. Y-You should
know that, Joe!

342
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,073
You should
definitely know that!

343
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:08,441
Sorry, Peter.

344
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,443
Sorry doesn't show me
nipples worth seeing!

345
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:13,279
And as for you, Anna, you're
dreadful and so is the program.

346
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:14,480
I didn't write it.

347
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:16,182
Yeah, but you know
the people who do.

348
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,784
That Alan Ball--
you know him, right?

349
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:18,818
Yeah.

350
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:19,919
How come everything
he writes

351
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:21,821
is so dreary?
I don't know.

352
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,556
Tell him to cheer up!
Things ain't so bad!

353
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:26,025
This is a weird episode.

354
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:30,062
Okay, Quagmire, I want you
to take the first bite

355
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,430
out of this fudge pop,

356
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:33,866
because that first bite
is the one that really hurts.

357
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:36,302
Well, okay.

358
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,889
(grunting)

359
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:42,091
Ah! Ow!

360
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,092
Ow!

361
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Yeah, that's right "Ow."

362
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:45,261
Now, you swallow that.

363
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,562
Don't you dare spit that out.

364
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,513
What's the
difference?

365
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:48,431
You got what
you wanted.

366
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:49,448
I said swallow it!

367
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:50,633
(gulps)

368
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,168
Now, smear what's
left of it on your face

369
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:56,088
and look at me
with your mouth open.

370
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:58,291
Look at yourself,
you filthy whore.

371
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:02,595
I don't even
want this now.

372
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:09,769
Okay, guys, now you're gonna do
a synchronized duet

373
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:12,338
of "Makin' Whoopee" while
I shoot you with this BB gun.

374
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:13,372
That doesn't
sound safe.

375
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,207
Action!

Relax, Joe.

392
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:45,037
I'm nowhere near your eye.

393
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:46,505
Hey, Joe, open your eye.

394
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:49,342
(screaming)
Gotcha.

395
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:51,310
What the hell, Peter?!
You shot him in the eye!

396
00:13:51,378 --> 00:13:52,778
Keep singing, you.
And keep your chin up,

397
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:54,013
so I can see your throat.

398
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:55,798
No, no screw this!
You're a jerk!

399
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:57,600
Jerk? What kind of a way is that

400
00:13:57,668 --> 00:13:59,435
to talk to your friend
who gives you money?

401
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:00,536
Go to hell, Peter!

402
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:01,737
We don't need
your money!

403
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,239
And we don't need
friends like you!

404
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:04,607
Yeah! We're out of here!

405
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:05,875
Fine, go on. I don't care.

406
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:07,710
I don't need you, I got money!

407
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:10,046
You know, Peter,
you used to be a great guy.

408
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:11,647
But ever since
you won that lottery...

409
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:13,115
(screaming)

410
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:14,917
Come on, Joe!

411
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,719
(bleep) this guy!
Aah!

412
00:14:20,023 --> 00:14:22,091
I'm here to audition
for <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

413
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,492
Come right in.

414
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:34,119
Peter, my God, what the
hell are you wearing?

415
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,237
It's a solid gold
tuxedo, Lois.

416
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:37,706
I had to fight three rappers

417
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,607
down at the Nonsense Store
for this.

418
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,409
Look, Peter, this
is not who we are.

419
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:43,511
I'm worried the money
is changing this family,

420
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,013
and not the
way you hoped.

421
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:47,348
Well, I was hoping it would make
you shut up, so you're right.

422
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,150
You know, I spoke to
Bonnie this morning,

423
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:52,120
and she said you haven't talked
to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks.

424
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:53,671
Who cares?
I don't need Quagmire.

425
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:55,373
And I certainly don't need Joe.

426
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:56,674
I got Money Joe.

427
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:57,659
(laughs)

428
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,060
That's a good one, Money Joe!

429
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:01,229
I don't like what this money
is doing to us.

430
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:03,331
It's even affecting
Brian and Stewie.

431
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,466
(yawns)

432
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:05,633
I think I'm gonna
take a nap.

433
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,836
What, here?
Yeah, I had a giant mobile

434
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:10,255
put in the sky so I can
sleep wherever I want.

435
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:12,774
(mobile playing soft music)

436
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:15,110
(sighs)
This is nice.

437
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:17,428
I hope that bear
comes around soon.

438
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,031
That's sort of my fave--
Oh, look, the bear!

439
00:15:20,098 --> 00:15:21,549
And it's not just them.

440
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:24,519
Chris has also been developing
some very expensive tastes.

441
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:26,855
Model glue, sir?

442
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:28,573
Well, what do
we have today?

443
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:31,726
Today we have a recent vintage
procured just this morning

444
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:33,478
from Michael's Hobby Shop.

445
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:35,547
Yes, that's
very nice.

446
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:37,515
Bring me my
finest rag.

447
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,334
Your fancy rag, sir.

448
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:41,186
You are relieved
for the evening.

449
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:46,374
(inhales deeply)

450
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:49,444
You don't see
poor people doing this!

451
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:50,678
Lois, don't you understand?

452
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:52,947
We don't got any of
our old problems anymore.

453
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:54,883
We don't have to worry
about paying bills,

454
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,768
we don't have to worry
about saving dough.

455
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,237
All we got to do
is enjoy ourselves.

456
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:00,321
Interested?

457
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,041
(gasps)

458
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:05,493
Oh, my God.

459
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:08,830
Peter, it's
beautiful!

460
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:10,131
Is it a blood
diamond?

461
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,566
Ah, the bloodiest.

462
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:14,235
The two kids who found it were
forced to murder each other.

463
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,070
Oh, Peter,
I love it.

464
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:19,007
Hey, you want to watch a DVD
of the murder while we do it?

465
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:20,291
I already watched it
eight times,

466
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,494
so I know exactly
which part I want to blam at.

467
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:28,132
Chris, Meg, now that
I'm a rich father,

468
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,635
you will try to impress me,
and I will remain distant.

469
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:31,736
Go.

470
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,838
Um, say, Dad,
did I tell you

471
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:36,007
I got second place
in the yacht race?

472
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:38,276
Hmm. Sounds like
somebody's dad

473
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:39,944
is happier than
me right now.

474
00:16:40,012 --> 00:16:41,646
Well, um, how about this, Dad?

475
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:43,781
The school paper is
doing a story about me.

476
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:45,583
That's because I
had it arranged.

477
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:48,419
Uh, I was thinking about
joining the Army?

478
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:49,687
No.

479
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:51,689
Meg, as a girl, your
life holds no merit.

480
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:53,925
And, Chris, try as you
may, you will never be

481
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:55,793
as good as your older
brother who died.

482
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,495
He was good at
sports and talking.

483
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:59,414
Now, pardon me
while I look at scrimshaw

484
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,182
through a magnifying glass.

485
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,685
Ah, brave men all.

486
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:05,653
Lost sons of New Bedford.

487
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:07,322
That's good scrimshaw.

488
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:12,994
Ah, I never thought
I'd be having high tea

489
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:15,263
at the Park Barrington
every single day.

490
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:18,032
Yes, it's nice to eat in a sea
of white faces, isn't it?

491
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,369
Waiter, have the chef prepare
a bucket of your finest caviar,

492
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:23,421
and then give it
a helicopter tour of the city.

493
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:24,455
Very good, sir.

494
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:25,990
Very good indeed.

495
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,960
I hope it enjoys it as much as
that Maine lobster I ordered.

496
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,429
And over there is the
Rhode Island State House,

497
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:33,698
the second largest
self-supporting marble dome

498
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,133
in North America.

499
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,701
Why the (bleep)
am I doing this?

500
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,303
I could've just
said I did it.

501
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,038
Sir, about
your bill...

502
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:41,639
Oh, don't worry, Carstairs,

503
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:43,775
there's ample gratuity
on there for you.

504
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:45,143
(chuckles):
Nyah.

505
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,946
Well, actually, sir, your
card has been declined.

506
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:49,380
(laughs):
Oh, really?

507
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:51,799
Well, I'm sure a brief call
to my accountant

508
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,002
will resolve this
to our mutual satisfaction.

509
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:57,238
Hello, Schnozzenstein?

510
00:17:57,306 --> 00:17:58,640
This is Peter Griffin.

511
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:00,642
There seems to be
some issue with our credit.

512
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:03,511
I told Carstairs
you'd set everything straight.

513
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:05,013
What do you mean I'm broke?!

514
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,365
What about all that money
I sent to the Gayman Islands?

515
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,167
They did what with it?!

516
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:11,269
No, I don't want it back!

517
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:12,987
I'm gonna miss you,
Carstairs.

518
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:15,523
I shall miss
you, too, sir.

519
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:17,208
With no one to look after,

520
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,043
Carstairs fell into
a deep depression

521
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:20,812
from which he never emerged.

522
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:22,647
He died two weeks later.

523
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:24,282
Some say of a broken heart.

524
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,283
What, sir?

525
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:26,584
But that was Carstairs.

526
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:31,639
I can't believe it.

527
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:32,974
We lost everything.

528
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:34,575
What do we do now?

529
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:36,844
Well, seems like our
only hope is the lottery.

530
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:39,981
Holy (bleep), we won twice and
we're right back here again.

531
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,418
We had $150 million, and
we blew through it in a month.

532
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:45,603
Yeah, but on the bright side,
if this hadn't happened,

533
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:46,738
we never would've met Kyle.

534
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:48,406
Hey.

535
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:49,440
Hello. Hey there.
Hi. What's up?

536
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:51,009
And that's not even Kyle.

537
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:52,543
Peter, we can't
live like this.

538
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:54,262
Well, what are we
supposed to do, Lois?

539
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,463
Everything we
had is gone!

540
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,081
We have friends, Peter.

541
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:58,366
Not anymore, we don't.

542
00:18:58,434 --> 00:18:59,600
They're good people.

543
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:00,702
They'll listen.

544
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:02,403
And they'll care
what happens to us,

545
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:05,173
even after everything
that's happened.

546
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,475
You know, I'm still young
enough you can drop me

547
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:09,310
at the fire station,
no questions asked.

548
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:19,687
Well, well.
Look who it is.

549
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:20,655
Who is it?

550
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:21,773
It's me, Peter.

551
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,707
I'm standing
right here.

552
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:24,208
This is a glass eye, Peter.

553
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:25,977
They had to remove
the one you shot.

554
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:28,446
Oh, boy, that whole
day was a mess, huh?

555
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:30,214
What happened to you, anyway?
You look terrible.

556
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:32,650
Look, you guys,
I messed up bad.

557
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:34,652
Winning the lottery
was the worst thing

558
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,554
that ever happened
to me and my family.

559
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:39,090
I thought being rich
would solve all my problems,

560
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:42,193
but all it did was make me
forget what was important.

561
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,328
Like who my real friends are.

562
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,080
I don't expect
you to forgive me,

563
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,667
but if, for some reason, you do,
you can find me

564
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:52,369
in a cardboard box on the corner
of Meeting and Thayer.

565
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:55,423
Peter, wait.

566
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:58,976
That corner's
a bit of a hike for me.

567
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:00,561
I'd rather just
come see you at home.

568
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:05,416
What-- where'd you get
this kind of money?

569
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:07,985
The penis enlargement pill you
gave me the startup money for.

570
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:09,504
It turned a pretty nice profit.

571
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:11,939
I guess it's only fair
that I give you my percentage

572
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:13,658
so you can get your house back.

573
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:17,428
Quagmire, I don't know
what to say.

574
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:18,563
Thank you.

575
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,947
You're welcome.

576
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:21,966
And if it makes you feel better,
it was money well spent.

577
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:23,518
Just ask Sandra
the waitress over there.

578
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:25,136
We had a great time
last night.

579
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:26,771
PETER:
Tough girl.

580
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,139
Made it into work.

581
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,177
Boy, I got to say,
it's good to be home.

582
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:35,012
Yeah. Despite all
the ups and downs,

583
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,647
things turned out for the best.

584
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:39,317
I mean, really, we're no worse
off than we were before.

585
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:40,985
Plus, we learned something.

586
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:42,820
And you can't
put a price on that.

587
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:44,222
Look, Lois, we all know
what happened.

588
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:45,422
We're all depressed.

589
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:47,141
All right, let's just
go to different rooms

590
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:49,043
and stare blankly
out the window, saying nothing.

591
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:53,111

592
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,137
Congratulations to
tonight's sweepstakes winner,

593
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:01,089
Daniel San Martin Marrero.

594
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:02,290
MODEL: Shapes.
Shut up.
