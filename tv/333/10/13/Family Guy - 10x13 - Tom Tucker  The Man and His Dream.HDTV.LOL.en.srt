12
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:37,014
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker,

13
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,116
and the reason I'm wearing
this mask is because

14
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:41,585
we've got a Make-A-Wish
kid in the studio tonight,

15
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:43,587
who, as you'll find out
as the show goes on,

16
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:45,122
is quite a cougher.

17
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:48,001
In local news, Mayor West
signed a bill today...

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,393
See? That's-that's
what I was talking about.

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,620
Are we gonna get that,

20
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,471
or are we gonna wait
for commercial?

21
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,674
No, no, you have
to spray it.

22
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:00,375
You can't just wipe--
look, you know what?

23
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:02,110
Let's just throw
the whole camera out.

24
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:03,645
Okay, Joyce,
you talk now.

25
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:04,873
I-I don't even want
to open my mouth.

26
00:01:04,874 --> 00:01:07,166
You know, Tom,
I haven't seen you in a mask

27
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,568
since you went under the stage
name George P. Wilbur.

28
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,469
Oh-ho-ho, Joyce,
you know we don't talk

29
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:12,837
about that on the air.

30
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,005
Oh, my God!

31
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:15,507
Did she... did
she just say

32
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:17,926
that George P. Wilbur was
Tom Tucker's stage name?

33
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:19,961
Who the hell
is George P. Wilbur?

34
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,697
That's the guy who played
Michael Myers in <i>Halloween 4,</i>

35
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:24,849
the greatest movie
of all time.

36
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,918
I've only seen that movie
about a thousand times.

37
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:28,553
How could I not
have noticed that?

38
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,763
Good evening. I'm Michael Myers.

39
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:40,331
I have enormous
psychological problems,

40
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,234
and I'm going
to take them out on you.

41
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:45,069
It <i>is</i> him. I
can't believe it.

44
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:50,020
was your favorite movie.

45
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,826
No, that's my
favorite period piece.

46
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:53,695
Well, that and <i>Good</i>
<i>Night and Good Luck.</i>

47
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:55,563
Even though I was tricked
into leaving early.

48
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:57,632
Good night and good luck.

49
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,502
And good night
and good luck to you, sir.

50
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,424
Oh, hi, Chris.

51
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:07,892
How was school?

52
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,761
It was great.
I met a girl, Mom!

53
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,446
That's wonderful, honey.

54
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:13,531
Yeah, her name is
Lindsey, like the state.

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,020
Is she nice?

56
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:16,545
Yeah, she's really
nice and super pretty,

57
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:18,403
and her bicycle seat
smells like strawberries.

58
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,206
Oh. Okay.

59
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:23,491
I'm gonna go upstairs
and alternate between

60
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,878
hopeful excitement
and suicidal pessimism!

61
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,451
Got to get the energy up.

62
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,489
Found it.

63
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:40,592
Hey, uh, excuse
me, Mr. Tucker.

64
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,752
You got a second?

65
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:43,377
Oh, hello, Peter.
Sure, come on in.

66
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:44,836
Thanks. Um, hey, listen,

67
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:46,361
I just found out that
you were the guy

68
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:48,833
who played Michael Myers
in <i>Halloween 4,</i>

69
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:49,865
and I just want to say,

70
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,925
I think that was the most
brilliant performance ever

71
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:53,271
in the history
of everything,

72
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,807
and I wanted to see
if you would sign my DVD.

73
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,842
Oh, I suppose.

74
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,227
Thanks. Hey, so,
what happened?

75
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:01,462
How come you never
did any more movies?

76
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,398
Well, I tried to make a career
out there in Hollywood,

77
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:06,034
but I just didn't realize
how tough acting is.

78
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,235
Well, you know
what they say--

79
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:08,736
"Tough actin' Tinactin."

80
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:10,705
I wish I'd
known that then.

81
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:12,302
You see, life after
<i>Halloween 4</i>

82
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:13,748
wasn't exactly smooth sailing.

83
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,710
Once I stepped out
from behind that mask,

84
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:18,162
Hollywood gave me
the cold shoulder.

85
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:21,833
<i>The work I did manage to get</i>

86
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:25,053
<i>was usually just bit parts</i>
<i>that didn't last too long.</i>

87
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:27,705
<i>Like the role of Denise's</i>
<i>boyfriend on</i> The Cosby Show.

88
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:29,190
It's nice
to meet you, Martin.

89
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:30,625
Thank you,
Mrs. Huxtable.

90
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,560
So, if you guys
are a family,

91
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,829
why are none of you
the same shade of black?

92
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:38,182
<i>I was also coked out</i>
<i>of my skull most of the time.</i>

93
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,668
<i>But whatever the case,</i>
<i>I was done.</i>

94
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,739
I left Hollywood, moved back
to my hometown of Quahog,

95
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,058
and wound up working
here as a news anchor.

96
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,527
Wow. Well,
don't you miss it?

97
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:52,230
Every second of every day,
but I can't touch coke again.

98
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,831
It would ruin my life.

99
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:54,666
No, I mean acting.

100
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,100
Oh. Of course.

101
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:58,903
But it's over for me.
That's all in the past.

102
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:01,839
Well, if you ask me, you got the
makings of a star.

103
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,409
- And I want to help you get there.
- Well, that's a nice offer,

104
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,678
but I'm not quite sure
how you expect to do that.

105
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:08,947
Well, you've brought me
so much joy over the years

106
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:10,648
as that lovable
murderer of teenagers,

107
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:12,450
and I want to
return the favor.

108
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,052
I don't even have
an agent anymore.

109
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,454
Well, then how about this?
I'll be your agent.

110
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:17,531
You?

111
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:19,056
Yeah, I've seen every
episode of <i>Entourage.</i>

112
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,625
All you need is
some fake hair

113
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,527
and a bunch of Hobbits
hanging around you.

114
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:24,245
You're on in five
minutes, Mr. Tucker.

115
00:04:24,313 --> 00:04:25,446
You don't belong here.

116
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:26,814
You're better than this.

117
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:28,716
You're <i>Halloween 4</i> better.

118
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:30,234
Look, I appreciate
your offer,

119
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:32,320
but I've got a pretty
good thing going here.

120
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:34,029
In a few minutes,
I've got to be on camera

121
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:36,134
in front of <i>800</i> people.

122
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:42,864
Good evening, Quahog.
I'm Tom Tucker.

123
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:45,683
Our top story tonight: The
Rhode Island Historical Society

124
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:48,753
is heralding the arrival
of a cast-iron, oak-handled

125
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,488
Colonial bedsheet warmer,

126
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,957
now on display
in the Statehouse Rotunda.

127
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,592
<i>Okay, there it is.</i>

128
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,396
<i>As I understand it, they would</i>
<i>put the coal inside of that,</i>

129
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,432
<i>and then put the object</i>
<i>between the sheets.</i>

130
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,601
<i>It was very cold back then.</i>

131
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,570
<i>And it would warm the sheets.</i>

132
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:09,440
<i>And I-I think that's</i>
<i>the gist of it.</i>

133
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,342
<i>How much footage</i>
<i>of this do we have?</i>

134
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,077
<i>Oh-oh, this is live.</i>

135
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:14,479
<i>This... Can-can she hear me?</i>

136
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:16,814
<i>Okay, you can put it down now.</i>

137
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:19,417
<i>You... She</i> can't <i>hear me. Okay.</i>

138
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,987
<i>What the hell is going on here?</i>

139
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,523
<i>Is it... is it...</i>
<i>Am I having a stroke?</i>

140
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:29,160
Wait, Peter! Don't go!

141
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,012
So, you changed
your mind, huh, buddy?

142
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,663
We going to Hollywood?

143
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:34,415
You betcha.
But I have to say,

144
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:36,333
I thought you'd
drive a fancier car.

145
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:37,485
What? Why?

146
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:40,121
Well, aren't you the Peter Griffin
of Peter Griffin Cadillac?

147
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:41,422
No, that's another guy.

148
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,424
Hi. I'm Peter Griffin,

149
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:46,444
and at Peter Griffin Cadillac,
we believe in three things:

150
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,247
fair dealing, family,
and friendship.

151
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,149
I've lived in Quahog
my whole life.

152
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,617
I love it here.

153
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,986
And you're gonna love
a Peter Griffin Cadillac.

154
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,087
Scumbag.

155
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,251
All right, Lois,
remember to feed the cat,

156
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:05,776
and remember to get a cat.

157
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,851
I still don't understand
why you got to go

158
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,353
all the way
to Hollywood.

159
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,588
Because I know Tom Tucker
could be a great actor,

160
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:13,724
and I'm gonna help him
make it happen.

161
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,659
You see, everybody
needs just one person

162
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:17,160
to believe in
their dreams

163
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:19,696
so they can spread
their wings and fly.

164
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:21,365
Dad, can I have money
for dance classes?

165
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:22,933
Sit down, you
dumpy bread loaf.

166
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,568
I'd pay to see
you <i>not</i> dance.

167
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,336
- When will you be back?
- I don't know.

168
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:28,005
But I'll be sure
to be back

169
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:29,573
before Chris's big
dance class recital.

170
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:31,141
I believe
in that boy.

171
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:32,542
I don't want
to dance!

172
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,744
You'll dance!

173
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:43,253
Boy, I don't
know, Peter,

174
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:45,339
being back out here makes me
kind of nervous.

175
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:46,757
Maybe-maybe this
was all a mistake.

176
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:48,475
Don't be silly, Tom--
you're an actor,

177
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,177
and this is where you belong.
Now, let's take some of

178
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:53,063
this complimentary luggage
and get going.

179
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,933
Well, so, h-how
do we do this?

180
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:57,752
You do nothing.

181
00:06:57,777 --> 00:06:59,277
You just sit back
and let your agent

182
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:01,491
knock on every door in
Hollywood till he gets

183
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:02,716
you an acting job.

184
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:05,609
And that starts right now.

185
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,344
Yes? C-Can
I help you?

186
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:08,812
No, but I can help you.

187
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,514
You need to hire this man.

188
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:13,016
Oh. Um, okay.

189
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:16,353
Well, do you have any experience
handling bags?

190
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:17,821
Aha! I see!

191
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:19,556
Typical casting-couch stuff.

192
00:07:19,624 --> 00:07:21,658
All right, kid,
you want to make it

193
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:23,110
in showbiz
or don't you?

194
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:30,534
I thought the airport
was Hollywood.

195
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:39,142
Hey, Mom, I want you to
meet my new girlfriend.

196
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,243
New girlfriend?

197
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:41,645
Yeah, you remember that girl

198
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,113
Lindsey I told you about?

199
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:46,550
Well, I asked her out,
and now we are dating.

200
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:49,636
Lindsey, this is my mom,
my little brother Stewie,

201
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,505
and my dog Brian.

202
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,372
Hey.

203
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,741
Oh, my God.

204
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,243
My goodness,
look at you.

205
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,546
Do you even realize
who you look like?

206
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:00,747
Cameron Diaz,
that's who.

207
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,283
You are gorgeous!

208
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:05,152
Well, she's awful pretty-- I
know <i>that,</i> Mom.

209
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,453
Are you kidding me?

210
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:07,788
Are they not seeing this?

211
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,489
I know, it's kind of creepy.
It's almost like

212
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,491
he's dating Lois.
Yeah.

213
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,560
Looks like somebody's
getting a little Oedipus-y.

214
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:15,479
- Can we say that?
- Just did.

215
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:21,084
All right, Tom, this is
totally gonna work.

216
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:22,903
All the biggest Hollywood
players eat here,

217
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,522
and we just got to make them
think we're one of them.

218
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,891
That's why I got these
old Hollywood Jew glasses.

219
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,192
Waiter! Oh, waiter!

220
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,211
Yes sir. Are you gentlemen
ready to order?

221
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,331
Yes, I will have the Big and Fancy,
and my client here

222
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:35,412
will have a bottle
of your best steak.

223
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:36,637
Right away, sir.

224
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:38,143
Peter, I-I'm not sure
what any of this

225
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,676
has to do with
getting me acting jobs.

226
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,101
Tom, who's the agent here?

227
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,681
- You are.
- And who is the actor?

228
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:44,483
Well, I am.

229
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:46,685
Wait, which one am I again?
The agent.

230
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:49,205
And who's paying for dinner?
I assumed you were.

231
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:51,574
Ah, then we best load
our pockets with bread

232
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:54,159
and get the hell
out of here.

233
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:55,311
We have to go!

234
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,963
Not expensive enough!

235
00:08:58,031 --> 00:09:00,549
Excuse me, I couldn't help but
notice your glasses,

236
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:03,752
your poor table manners and
your huge sense of entitlement.

237
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,187
- Are you an agent?
- I am.

238
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,656
You've got ten seconds
to dazzle me. Go.

239
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:10,376
Well, I'm the casting
director for <i>NCIS,</i>

240
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:13,112
and we need an actor for a
mall role that shoots tomorrow.

241
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,914
This is your man.

242
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:17,049
That's great! He's got just
the look we're after.

243
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:19,485
Show up here at
10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

244
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:20,903
How about that, huh, Tom?

245
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,204
You're back in
the business.

246
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,073
Wow, Peter,
I can't believe it!

247
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,457
Hey, don't be
so surprised.

248
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,459
I've been pounding the
pavement for you, buddy.

249
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:29,461
I even gave out all
my business cards.

250
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,230
Call me! Call me! Call me!

251
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:34,833
Call me! Call me!
Call me! Call me!

252
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,653
Ah, show business.

253
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:43,292
Oh, hi, you two.

254
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,961
You know, Lindsey, I just
want to say how nice it is

255
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:48,163
to have such a beautiful young
woman in our home.

256
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:49,398
Oh, a baby.

257
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,133
I almost had one
of you twice.

258
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:53,652
Who didn't, right?

259
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,055
So, what are you
two up to tonight?

260
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:57,873
Well, we really
haven't decided yet.

261
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:59,825
Eh, I'll think of something
while I'm taking

262
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:01,860
a chick dump in your
parents' bathroom.

263
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:04,430
And I will
hold your purse.

264
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:05,764
Good for Chris, huh?

265
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:07,466
He picked a
peach, didn't he?

266
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:10,536
Lois, don't you think maybe part
of the reason you like Lindsey

267
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:12,438
could be because she
looks so much like you?

268
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:13,622
What?

269
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,307
Come on, she's clearly
an awful person.

270
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,142
And I think it's possible
that your vanity

271
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,994
has made you
a little blind to that.

272
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:21,897
Oh... I see what's
going on here-- you're jealous.

273
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,366
Chris has a wonderful
young woman in his life,

274
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:25,934
and you've got nothing.

275
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,136
She's kind of
right, Brian.

276
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:29,271
All you've got is
a worn-out rope toy

277
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,441
and that squirrel who comes
by once a day to taunt you.

278
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,627
Hey!

279
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:36,795
Hey, get out of here!
This is our yard!

280
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:38,597
You don't belong there!
Don't you touch anything!

281
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:39,898
I told you all this yesterday!

282
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:54,430
To your first big
TV acting job.

283
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:56,498
<i>We now return to</i> NCIS.

284
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,334
Oh, here it is.
Here comes my part.

285
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,003
Excuse me.

286
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:02,838
I'm looking for
Ed Manzelli.

287
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:04,473
Good evening.
I'm Ed Manzelli.

288
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,141
What can I do for you?

289
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:08,377
I'm looking for a guy
who used to work here.

290
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,379
Name's Mario.
Got any idea where he could be?

291
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:12,281
I haven't seen him
in over a month.

292
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:13,916
That's the end of my line.

293
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,951
Your line, <i>NCIS.</i>

294
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,887
You son of a bitch,
you made me feel again.

295
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,423
Oh, don't you go
'cause I'll go.

296
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,942
You know, Peter, I
just want to thank you

297
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,444
for all you've
done for me.

298
00:11:25,512 --> 00:11:27,279
You... You are one
hell of an agent.

299
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:29,214
Well, with you
as a client, it's easy.

300
00:11:29,282 --> 00:11:30,366
Mr. Griffin?

301
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,784
Yes, Sandra?
You have a secretary?

302
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:33,686
She calls herself
an assistant, but yes.

303
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:34,987
What is it, Sandra?

304
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:36,655
There's a man
here to see you.

305
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:39,458
He says he wants to talk
to you about being his agent.

306
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:41,560
Really?! Well, then,
by all means, send him in!

307
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:43,145
Hey, knucklebutts!

308
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:45,414
James Woods?!

309
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:47,049
But I... I don't understand!

310
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:48,784
I... I thought you were dead!

311
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,352
Well...
I'm not.

312
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,553
I don't believe you.

313
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,088
God, is that true?

314
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:54,490
God?

315
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:57,092
God, are you there?

316
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:06,118
Come on, don't touch yourself.
You're God.

317
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,868
I-I don't get it.
Last time we saw you,

318
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:17,704
Diane Simmons had just stabbed
you in the back with a knife.

319
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,973
Yeah! How the hell
did you come back to life?!

320
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,425
Well, gentlemen,

321
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:24,211
sometimes being a big Hollywood
star has its advantages.

322
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:31,368
Hey, is this guy somebody?

323
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:33,103
Yeah, that's James Woods!

324
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,504
We got a celebrity here!

325
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:36,590
I repeat, this is not
a normal dead person!

326
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:37,691
This is a celebrity!

327
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:41,812
<i>Being a famous movie star</i>
<i>entitled me</i>

328
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,563
<i>to topnotch medical care</i>

329
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:46,984
<i>not available</i>
<i>to the rest of society.</i>

330
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:49,602
<i>My body was immediately taken</i>
<i>to a Hollywood hospital,</i>

331
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:53,307
<i>where I was hooked up</i>
<i>to a 17-year-old ingenue.</i>

332
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:57,828
<i>And in accordance</i>
<i>with Hollywood law,</i>

333
00:12:57,912 --> 00:12:59,613
<i>her life force was infused</i>
<i>into me,</i>

334
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,299
<i>bringing me back from the dead.</i>

335
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,217
<i>What happened to the girl?</i>

336
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,203
<i>I threw her out a car window</i>
<i>at Nora Ephron.</i>

337
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,057
Stop making
Jack Nicholson a pansy!

338
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,959
You're thinking of Nancy Meyers!

339
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,961
You're the same thing!

340
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,429
Wow. That's amazing.

341
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,798
So, what do you say, Peter?
Will you be my agent?

342
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,116
I don't get it.
Why would a big shot

343
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:20,550
like you want me for an agent?

344
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:22,602
Because you're an up-and-comer,
because you're hungry.

345
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:23,854
I am hungry.

346
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:25,489
But you put me
and my family

347
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,357
through a lot of
crap over the years.

348
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:28,925
Why would I want
to help you?

349
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:30,160
Well, because
you're my agent.

350
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:31,695
Oh, my God, you're
right! I am!

351
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:32,996
Hey, hold on now.

352
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:34,848
You came out here
to be <i>my</i> agent.

353
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,683
Tom, relax,
I can take care of you both.

354
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,418
You'd be surprised
how much I can handle.

355
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:41,288
Peter, I need you to drop
Stewie off at day care,

356
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:43,790
and then shred this big
stack of old bank statements.

357
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:45,392
You got it, Lois.

358
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:49,429
Is he always
this quiet?

359
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,535
So, Kevin made another attempt
on his life last night.

360
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,604
He drank two bottles
of dish soap.

361
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,206
Well, we have
some news, too.

362
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,875
Chris is dating the
most wonderful girl.

363
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:04,478
You know, everyone said, "Don't
smoke during your pregnancy,"

364
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,748
but I think some of it rubbed
off on him 'cause now he's cool.

365
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,182
That's nice.

366
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,917
Well, I should go, Lois.

367
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:13,704
Yeah, I should probably
get going myself.

368
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,072
Oh, my God!

369
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:19,559
What? What is it, Lois?

370
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:20,927
That girl over there--

371
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:22,896
that... that's
Chris's girlfriend!

372
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:25,665
Hey, you know, she kind of
looks like you, Lois.

373
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:27,934
Maybe <i>she'll</i> thank me
for buying the coffee.

374
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,070
You think she
looks like me, too?

375
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:31,872
Oh, my God.

376
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,774
I'm starting to
think Brian was right.

377
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,977
Maybe I have been blinded
by my own stupid vanity.

378
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:38,745
That girl is
nothing but trouble.

379
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,614
Are you gonna tell Chris?

380
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,349
I guess I'll have to,

381
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,618
but he doesn't take
bad news very well.

382
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,854
Oh, Chris, honey,
I'm so sorry to tell you this,

383
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:50,223
but your grandfather died.

384
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,067
All right, gentlemen.

385
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:01,968
So, what do you got
for my client?

386
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:03,770
Well, we're making a
mediocre action film,

387
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:06,473
and we think James is just the
guy to do a serviceable job

388
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,209
in a supporting role that
Jeremy Irons, Jeff Goldblum,

389
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:11,311
and Craig T. Nelson
have already passed on.

390
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,613
Well, we'd need
to see a script first.

391
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:14,815
Oh, looks good.

392
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,149
What do you think, James?

393
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:17,250
I like it.
Good.

394
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:18,819
I say we move on this.

395
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,187
All right, then,
let's negotiate.

396
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,838
- We want everything.
- We'll give you nothing.

397
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:23,557
- We want something.
- Deal.

398
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:30,263
Ugh, not this hillbilly
from Rhode Island again.

399
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:32,499
No thank you.

400
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,034
This is Peter Griffin,
famous agent,

401
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:35,735
but you can call me PG-13.

402
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:37,003
Ba-boom!

403
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:38,271
Leave a message.

404
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,639
Hi, Peter, it's Tom.

405
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,475
Uh, just trying
to reach you again.

406
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,076
And you know,
about that meeting

407
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:44,978
you set up with me
and Heath Ledger...

408
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:46,613
He... He never showed.

409
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:49,216
Maybe I was at the wrong
Panda Express, but I...

410
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,551
Anyway, uh, call me back.

411
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:56,706
Hey, listen, thanks for
inviting me to lunch, Peter.

412
00:15:56,774 --> 00:15:58,141
I-I was starting
to get nervous

413
00:15:58,209 --> 00:15:59,743
when you weren't
returning my calls.

414
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:02,412
Tom, I... I didn't know
how to say this to you,

415
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,181
so, here,
take this piece of paper.

416
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:08,051
And you're on in four,
three, two...

417
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,487
"Peter Griffin drops Tom Tucker
as a client."

418
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:12,923
You're-you're dropping me
as a client?

419
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,257
Yeah, just heard it
on the news.

420
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:15,542
How could you do this?!

421
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,010
Look, it's a whole
different landscape

422
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:18,211
out here since Thursday.

423
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,746
Everything's on computers now.

424
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:21,948
Peter, I left a very
good job for this!

425
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:23,783
You're the only reason
I came back out here!

426
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,185
I wish I could help you, Tom,

427
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:26,453
but this is coming
from upstairs.

428
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:27,787
The karate studio?

429
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:29,289
Tom, I have to go now.

430
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:32,692
But if you're ever Kevin James,
I want you to give me a call.

431
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:39,916
Mm. Hello?

432
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:41,718
Peter, it's me, Woodsy!
I need a favor.

433
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:44,254
What?! It's, like, 2:00 a.m.

434
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:46,022
Yeah, so listen, I'm
at Chateau Marmont,

435
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,657
I just met this
18-year-old chick,

436
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:49,926
and I can't decide
whether to take her home

437
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:51,695
or keep doing blow
with Tom Sizemore

438
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:54,247
and see if I can do
better later in the night.

439
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:55,482
Well, okay, um...

440
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,083
Do, uh, do-do you love her?

441
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,252
What?! Look, I'm
texting you her picture.

442
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,022
Just tell me if you
think she's hot enough.

443
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:05,475
I... What is this
a picture of?

444
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:07,644
Is that the bottom
of a white pumpkin?

445
00:17:07,712 --> 00:17:09,212
Is she hot or not?

446
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,881
I-I guess.
Okay, good, great.

447
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,633
So clear out of your apartment;
we're gonna be there in 15.

448
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:14,885
What?! I'm sleeping.

449
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,720
Why can't you bring her
to your place?

450
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,121
I don't know, man.

451
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:19,656
It's my aunt's
daughter. It's weird.

452
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:26,346
Chris, honey,

453
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,381
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

454
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:29,849
Why, sure, Mom. Come on in.

455
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,618
Chris, you know
your girlfriend, Lindsey?

456
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:33,019
Yeah.

457
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,088
Well, honey,

458
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:37,791
I saw her making out
with another boy.

459
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,960
Was she kissing with her mouth,
or her pants-mouth?

460
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:41,261
Because she does both.

461
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,496
Chris, I can't believe
you knew about this!

462
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,098
That's terrible!

463
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,434
Why would you even date
a girl like that?

464
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,637
Well, because...
I-I thought she'd be like you.

465
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:51,705
Like me?

466
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,173
Well, you got to admit, Mom,

467
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:55,408
she does look a lot like you.

468
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:58,211
I mean, I just look at
you and Dad, you know?

469
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:00,931
He's a complete train wreck,
and you put up with him.

470
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:03,049
And I'm no prize myself.

471
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,720
So, I guess I figured if I don't
find a girl just like you,

472
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:08,688
I might never find anyone.

473
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,440
Oh, Chris.

474
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:12,342
Of course you'll find someone.

475
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,777
And you <i>are</i> a prize.

476
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:16,012
You're a handsome,
kind-hearted, young man,

477
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,949
and any girl would be lucky
to have you in her life.

478
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,283
You really think so?

479
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:22,085
Of course I do, sweetheart.

480
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:23,987
Thanks, Mo

481
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,857
Now I'm gonna take the child
filter off the computer,

482
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:29,960
and I want you
to have a fun night.

483
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:35,832
Okay, this is it, James.

484
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,667
I got your next
project right here.

485
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:40,487
Peter, you've pitched me
dozens of projects,

486
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:43,490
and all of them involve me
playing a hayride driver.

487
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,825
I don't know, I just
see you doing that.

488
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,078
You know, this year, it's
vampires, next year, it's hay.

489
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:49,346
These things go in cycles.

490
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:50,975
Peter, this is probably
a good time to fire you.

491
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:52,244
What?!

492
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:53,869
Come on, Peter,
who are we kidding?

493
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:55,719
You're a one-man operation.

494
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,487
You know me.
I need a whole crew.

495
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,373
I need a drugs guy,
a girls guy, a fitness guy,

496
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:03,910
a guy with a boat who can dump
stuff way-out-there kind of guy.

497
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:05,412
But... But you're
my only client!

498
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,613
Without you, I'm ruined!

499
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:08,148
Well, that's show business.

500
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,234
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to answer this fake phone call.

501
00:19:11,302 --> 00:19:12,769
Hello? Grimace
from McDonald's?

502
00:19:12,837 --> 00:19:14,537
Sorry, Peter,
I got to take this.

503
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:15,939
No, I understand.

504
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,847
Hey, Tom.

505
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,615
How you doing?

506
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:26,850
What do <i>you</i> want?

507
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,418
James Woods fired me.

508
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:30,720
Listen, I-I been thinking.

509
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:32,789
I was a real jerk to you.

510
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:34,324
I dragged you out here,

511
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:36,860
only to dump you
when you needed me the most.

512
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,178
I guess what I'm saying is,

513
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:40,413
I'm really sorry
about everything.

514
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:42,015
Sorry doesn't
cut it, Peter.

515
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,584
I quit my job, I left everything
behind to come out here.

516
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:46,386
I know, but I was
just trying to help.

517
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:47,954
I never wanted to let you down.

518
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:51,858
Well, I suppose your only crime
is that you believed in me.

519
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:54,194
And then stopped believing
in me rather abruptly.

520
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,595
So what do you say?

521
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,697
You ready to go back
to where we both belong?

522
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:00,333
Yup. Let's go home.

523
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:01,735
Sounds good.

524
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:04,771
Hey, check out this picture
James Woods texted me.

525
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,440
What is that? A balloon
running out of air?

526
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:09,376
Yeah, see, I was hoping
you would know.

527
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,011
It's his cousin's anus.

528
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,751
Good evening, Quahog.
I'm Tom Tucker.

529
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,285
And I'm Joyce Kinney.

530
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:22,589
Tom, I think I speak for all of
us here at Channel Five News

531
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,924
when I say it's good
to have you back here

532
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:26,025
at half your
original salary.

533
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:27,227
Still twice yours, Joyce.

534
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,628
Our top story tonight:

535
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:31,097
Quahog's first organic
supermarket opens this weekend.

536
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:33,299
So head on down
before the gays turn it

537
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,935
into a cruising ground like
they did the Barnes and Noble

538
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:38,071
upstairs coffee bar,
which they had to close.

539
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:40,440
Well, I'm just happy
Tom got his job back.

540
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,776
But I'm sorry I missed meeting
your girlfriend, Chris.

541
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:44,244
That's okay, Dad.

542
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,678
Yeah, Chris, I
never asked you.

543
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,981
What did Lindsey say when
you broke up with her?

544
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,716
Oh, she didn't seem to mind.

545
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:51,684
I think she already moved on
to someone else.

546
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,386
Thanks for buying me
these clothes, Glenn.

547
00:20:53,454 --> 00:20:54,687
You're welcome.

548
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,022
And you're dismissed.

549
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,957
Do I still get
to keep the 20?
