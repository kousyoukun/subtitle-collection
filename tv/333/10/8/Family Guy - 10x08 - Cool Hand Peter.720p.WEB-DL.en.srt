So, Cleveland,
you got to be pretty psyched

13
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:37,281
about President Ubama, huh?

14
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:38,800
W-What?

15
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:40,885
Well, I mean, you remember how
a lot of people said, like,

16
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,503
"Oh, Ubama's not gonna
be able to do it,"

17
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:43,738
but he's-he's
hanging in there.

18
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:45,423
Peter, it's "Obama."

19
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:47,391
Eh, You-bama, Me-bama,
We-bama, who cares?

20
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:49,677
It's a black guy in a suit,
let's just marvel at that.

21
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,145
Gosh, Cleveland,
it sure is great

22
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:53,698
having you back at The Clam,
even if it's just for a week.

26
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:01,155
Aw, Peter,
you're using the song!

27
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:02,423
Thank you.

28
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:03,825
Well, the numbers
ain't so good,

29
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:05,743
so we got to do everything
we can-- Hello, Lois.

30
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:07,295
Peter, where the hell are you?

31
00:01:07,362 --> 00:01:09,680
You told me you were gonna clean
out those boxes in the basement

32
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:10,882
and put them in the attic.

33
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:12,333
Lois, it just sounds like
busy work.

34
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:13,751
It is busy work.

35
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,753
I'm trying to keep you
off the streets and off drugs.

36
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:17,822
I'm selling those candy bars!

37
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,793
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you
want to buy some candy bars

38
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:25,163
so we can get some new uniforms
for our baseball team?

39
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,081
Where'd you get
those candy bars?

40
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:29,767
Peter, I need you home.

41
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:31,936
You also promised you'd fix
that shelf in the garage.

42
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:33,137
Oh, Lois, I'm losing you.

43
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:36,607
Hello? Hello?

44
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:37,608
Hello?

45
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:38,860
Oh, hey, Lois.

46
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:40,561
This is somebody else now.

47
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:42,463
There must've been
a cross connection.

48
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:44,599
My name is Mike,
and I'm somewhere else

49
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:45,867
trying to make my own call.

50
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,268
Fine, Mike.

51
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:49,403
You tell Peter he's in trouble
when he gets home.

52
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:52,173
You can tell him yourself,
because Mike is Peter!

53
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,307
Oh, my God.

54
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,542
Are you serious?

55
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,110
That was very good, Peter.

56
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:57,211
I know!

57
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,646
Geez.

58
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:00,831
That's all my life is lately,
just a bunch of chores.

59
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,367
I'm sick of Lois always
making me do stupid stuff.

60
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:04,735
I know what you're saying,
Peter.

61
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,103
Bonnie's always making me do

62
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,506
all these impossible
household tasks.

63
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:10,041
Joe, make sure you get

64
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:12,410
all the tire tracks
out of the carpet.

65
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:25,072
Learn to live with it, Bonnie!

66
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,274
There are tracks!

67
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,808
People make tracks!

68
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,010
Boy, I hear you, too.

69
00:02:29,077 --> 00:02:30,511
It's a lot of work
just to keep

70
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,246
my single guy fridge
sufficiently depressing.

71
00:02:33,682 --> 00:02:34,749
Let's see.

72
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,350
Ex-girlfriend's Yoplait.

73
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:37,919
Root beer from two Julys ago.

74
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:39,587
Here we go, expired milk.

75
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:44,125
Oh, my God, Jenny,
look how young you look.

76
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:45,860
I sympathize with y'all.

77
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:50,331
Donna makes me listen to Gayle
King on XM Radio 19 hours a day.

78
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:51,966
I tried to kill myself by

79
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:54,568
swallowing a nail clipper,
but I passed it.

80
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:56,037
What the hell
happened to us?

81
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:58,172
We used to be able to do
whatever the hell we wanted.

82
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,840
Now here we are,
in the prime of our lives,

83
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:01,592
and we're slaves to our women.

84
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,527
I know. An exciting
day for me

85
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:05,396
is when I watch
wheelchair porn.

86
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:07,064
Boy, do the sparks
fly on those.

87
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:08,566
Oh, is it hot?

88
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:11,719
Nah, it's mostly just chairs
smashing into each other.

89
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:14,021
Sometimes the director
has to come on camera

90
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:15,523
just to turn the
chairs around.

91
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,375
Well, why don't we make
our own excitement?

92
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:19,076
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, like,

93
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:20,211
maybe the four
of us should

94
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,412
do something
to reclaim our freedom.

95
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:23,047
Like go on a road trip,
find some adventure.

96
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,649
Quagmire,
that's a great idea!

97
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:26,167
Let's do a road trip!
Who's in?

98
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,021
No. No, no.

99
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:31,589
No, n-not you, Seamus.

100
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:32,657
Ah, poo.

101
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:37,928
All right, listen up, ladies.

102
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:40,564
We got something to say and we
ain't taking "no" for an answer.

103
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:41,999
We are going on a road trip.

104
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,517
We don't know how long
we'll be gone,

105
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:45,386
and don't expect a call
from us to check in.

106
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:47,621
This trip is about men
being men.

107
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:49,690
We will drive
after a couple of beers

108
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,475
and not make a big
federal case about it.

109
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:53,811
We're gonna sneeze and not
put our hand over.

110
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,780
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop us!

111
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:56,914
Yeah, okay with me.

112
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:57,815
- Sure.
- Fine.

113
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:59,250
That'll be nice.

114
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:00,785
It'll give us a chance
to have some girl time.

115
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:02,920
Oh. All right, then.

116
00:04:02,988 --> 00:04:04,088
Where are you boys going?

117
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,256
We're going to New Orleans.

118
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:07,124
The party capital of America.

119
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:09,393
Home of the
All-You-Can-Pee Street.

120
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,229
I'll tell you one thing, it's
all about the beads down there.

121
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:21,956
We all know
what's going on here.

122
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:23,858
It's just implied,
but we all know

123
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:25,443
what's going on
in this thought bubble.

124
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:27,395
The kids don't know, but we do.

125
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,496
Boy, I'm sure getting my money's
worth out of this rental car.

126
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,964
Okay, all right,
I got one.

127
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:49,583
Would you rather be a hobo
with a five percent chance

128
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:51,502
of getting inherited
by a rich guy

129
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:54,672
or be Hitler two years before
the end of World War II?

130
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:56,590
'Cause you know you're gonna
have to shoot yourself,

131
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:58,309
but you still got two
more years as Hitler.

132
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:00,094
If you're the hobo, do you, uh,

133
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:02,463
have a place to sleep,
like an underpass or...?

134
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:03,464
Different every night.

135
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:05,149
As Hitler, can I change

136
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,134
certain policies
so that maybe I'm looked on

137
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:09,019
more favorably
at the end of the war?

138
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:11,405
No, you already screwed up
big-time-- lot of dead Jews.

139
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:14,158
Am I a blue state
or a red state hobo?

140
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:16,643
Blue, but
Midwestern blue.

141
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:18,195
Oh, boy.

142
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,247
I don't think so,
it's cold out there.

143
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:21,648
Am I allowed
to alter the mustache?

144
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,667
Dude, why do you keep
trying to make Hitler work?

145
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:26,987
Am I allowed to kill other hobos
to increase my odds?

146
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:28,506
Kill anyone you
like; you're a hobo.

147
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,040
Am I a walking hobo?

148
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,009
No. Quagmire and Cleveland
are, but you're not.

149
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:34,044
So, wait, I would also
be a paralyzed Hitler?

150
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,296
Yeah.

151
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:36,931
Would I be
a black Hitler?

152
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:38,516
Yes. No.

153
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,684
Well, wait a minute,
now how come I got to be

154
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:42,219
crippled Hitler
and he's still white Hitler?

155
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:44,388
If you got such a problem with
it, Joe, just be the hobo!

156
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:45,639
This one isn't very fun.

157
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,475
Wait a minute, where are we?

158
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:49,944
Yeah, this doesn't look like
the main highway anymore.

159
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:51,195
You think we made
a wrong turn?

160
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,346
I hope not.

161
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:53,981
These backwoods parts
of the Deep South

162
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:55,900
ain't a place
you want to get lost in.

163
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:58,652
Oh, no.

164
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:03,424
Don't worry
about it, guys.

165
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:05,459
I read nowhere that Southern
sheriffs really want

166
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:07,361
to be talked down to by
big-shot Northerners.

167
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,681
Afternoon.

168
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:12,183
Officer, what is it?

169
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,151
We are in a tremendous
urban rush.

170
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:16,253
You fellas ain't from
around here, are you?

171
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:18,088
Hey, Sheriff,
I'm trying to learn Southern.

172
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:19,457
Is this saying anything?

173
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:21,725
A-doy-doy-doy-doy!

174
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:24,328
We're very sorry, Sheriff,
and we want to cooperate

175
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:26,096
to the fullest extent possible.

176
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:27,181
You threatening me?

177
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,315
Uh, no, sir.

178
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:29,917
Who you calling "sir," boy?

179
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:32,553
I'm an officer of the law,
paid by this county.

180
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:35,122
And I can't help noticing
you got a headlight out.

181
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,524
Really?
I don't see any...

182
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,528
And I see that turn signal
ain't working neither.

183
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:42,596
Now, look, sir,

184
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:44,098
I'm a police officer, too.

185
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,167
I know all the games;
I use them myself.

186
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:48,419
So what do you say
we just work something out?

187
00:06:48,503 --> 00:06:49,703
So, you're a cop, huh?

188
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:52,173
Let me see your badge.

189
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:55,576
Looks like you're
a civilian now.

190
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:58,345
I'm gonna have to
search your vehicle.

191
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:01,182
Well, lookie here.

192
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:02,900
What do we got in this thing?

193
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,952
Oh, come on!
You planted that there!

194
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,120
We had drugs?

195
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,921
Oh, my God,
why am I driving drunk

196
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:09,273
when I could've been
driving high?

197
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,442
You boys are in
a lot of trouble.

198
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,310
Dispatch,
Sheriff Nichols.

199
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:14,528
Bringing in four
perpetrators

200
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:16,263
under suspicion of
drug possession.

201
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:18,632
Descriptions: one
African-American,

202
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,534
one crippled, one
skinny, one handsome.

203
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:21,835
Yes.

204
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:23,904
You're all coming down
to the station with me.

205
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:24,939
Aw, crap!

206
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:26,507
Hang on, hang on,
you guys.

207
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:28,108
Don't worry. I know how to
speak this guy's language.

208
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:31,212
Keith Urban.

209
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,646
Go on.

210
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:34,648
Brett Favre.

211
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:35,683
Uh-huh.

212
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,718
I'm listening.

213
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:39,453
William H. Macy?

214
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:41,655
You guys are going
away for a long time.

215
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:54,247
Look at this, Cleveland.

216
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:55,998
Front of the bus,
back of the bus,

217
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:57,834
middle of the bus--
you guys are doing great.

218
00:07:57,885 --> 00:07:59,085
I can't believe this.

219
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,920
Two weeks in prison
on trumped-up charges.

220
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:02,855
That trial was a total sham.

221
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:05,291
Yeah, I knew we were in trouble
the minute I saw the jury.

222
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:09,645
Well, at least they're
a jury of our peers.

223
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:11,781
I don't think they see it
that way, Peter.

224
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:20,223
Hello, gentlemen.

225
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,724
I am the warden.

226
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,460
You are here
because you are criminals.

227
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:25,895
This is not a resort.

228
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:28,030
You will be worked harder
than you have ever

229
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,750
been worked in your miserable,
pathetic lives.

230
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:32,768
And play
harder, right?

231
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:33,936
I bet.

232
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:34,904
Step forward, maggot!

233
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,259
Next time, that'll be you.

234
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:42,228
Well, why wasn't
it him this time?!

235
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:44,263
Oh, I'm so scared.

236
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:46,966
Peter, stop it!

237
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,402
Yeah, you're real big when
you got that stick, ain't you?

238
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:50,636
Okay, I'll stop now.

239
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:55,942
This is so much fun,
isn't it?

240
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:56,976
I know.

241
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:58,377
What should we talk
about next?

242
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:00,313
I know, let's talk
about actresses.

243
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,480
Ooh, yeah.

244
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:03,482
I feel like Natalie Portman

245
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,985
thinks she's so much better
than everybody.

246
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:08,321
She's nothing, and her
husband's a nobody.

247
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:09,722
Why does Laura
Linney always

248
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,107
look like she's just
finished skiing?

249
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:12,508
I don't know
who that is.

250
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:14,810
<i>Really? The Big C?
Love Actually?</i>

251
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:16,112
No, never heard of her.

252
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:17,413
Would you know
who she was

253
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:19,148
if I said Tyler
Perry's Laura Linney?

254
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:20,516
Ooh, I love her.

255
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:28,174
Oh, God, it's so hot out here.

256
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:30,259
Yeah, you knew it was
gonna be hot when you heard

257
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:32,595
that lonesome slide guitar
and that hawk's cry.

258
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,668
Hey! This ain't break time!

259
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:41,354

Oh, yeah, thanks.

283
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:31,037
What the hell is that?

284
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:32,305
It's a jet pack.

285
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:34,290
I'll come back for you guys,
I promise.

286
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:41,430
You're my friend and everything
and I feel bad saying this,

287
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:43,633
but I wanted to see you fail.

288
00:10:53,844 --> 00:10:56,078
Official prediction:
when they let us out of here,

289
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:58,314
we're gonna have to go through
the prison gift shop.

290
00:10:58,382 --> 00:11:00,182
Oh, I hate doing that.

291
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,751
That's how
they get you.

292
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:04,220
Man, it's gonna feel so good
to walk out of here tomorrow.

293
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:06,455
Yeah, you know,
the time actually went by faster

294
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:07,657
than I would have thought.

295
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:09,392
Uh, you know something?

296
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,093
We left Quahog to find adventure

297
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,596
and get away from all
those lame chores at home,

298
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,231
but I'll tell you this.

299
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:18,467
Looking back on it now, I don't
think our lives are so bad.

300
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:20,369
Yeah, I sure do miss Lois
and the kids.

301
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:21,704
I'll tell you one thing.

302
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:23,739
When I get home,
I'm gonna sleep like a log.

303
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:26,759
Hey, I'm gonna plug in the
night-light if you don't mind.

304
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,177
Actually, you know what?

305
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:30,780
I'm gonna go ahead and
ask you to not do that.

306
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:33,399
Knock off that chitchat!
It's lights out!

307
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:35,701
Oh, hey, Warden, since
it's our last night in here,

308
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,536
can I have a glass of milk?

309
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:39,005
I feel like having
dream diarrhea.

310
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,690
Last night?

311
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:42,425
Where do you think
y'all are going?

312
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:45,561
Says here you got another
30 days on your sentence.

313
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:48,197
What?! But the court said we're
supposed to go home tomorrow!

314
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:50,266
Well, the court
ain't here, is it?

315
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:54,553
Oh, man, how the hell
are we gonna do this

316
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:55,721
for another 30 days?

317
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:59,125
That's the way
it goes around here.

318
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:01,794
Once you come in,
you're never allowed to leave.

319
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:04,463
I got my sentence extended
30 days once.

320
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:06,866
That was 45 years ago.

321
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,284
Oh, my God,
you hear that?

322
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:09,785
We're gonna be stuck
in here forever!

323
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:11,504
Oh, God, what are we gonna do?

324
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:13,005
Well, I know
what I'm gonna do.

325
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:14,707
If we're gonna be here a while,

326
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,543
I'm gonna find the biggest guy
here and kick his ass.

327
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,744
Wait a minute.
That's me!

328
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:20,896
Oh, no, I have a knife!

329
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:29,517
Oh, what are we gonna do?!

330
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:31,719
They're gonna keep us
locked up here forever!

331
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,538
We're not staying
in here forever.

332
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:35,173
- We're getting out of here.
- How?

333
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:36,724
We're breaking out.

334
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:37,525
What?

335
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:38,910
Look, sometimes in life,

336
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:41,262
you got to say, "What the hell,"
and just go for it.

337
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,164
I mean, that's how
we won the Revolutionary War.

338
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:46,768
Colonel, the British are too
entrenched across the river.

339
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,569
I've told the men
we'll hold our position.

340
00:12:52,491 --> 00:12:54,459
Negative. Tell the men,
we're going across.

341
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:56,094
But Colonel Goatbanger,
we've...

342
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:57,645
No, we need to do this,

343
00:12:57,713 --> 00:12:59,380
'cause... for...
'cause of... for strategy.

344
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:07,088
All right, if we're
gonna break out of here,

345
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:08,523
we got to get past
these guards.

346
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,991
Well, I got an idea.

347
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,976
It won't be pretty,
but bear with me.

348
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:15,546
Oh, no, I fell out
of my wheelchair!

349
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,400
Don't help me!

350
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:21,336
I need to do this on my own!

351
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,371
What are you doing, Joe?
You're embarrassing us.

352
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:24,772
Oh, really?
Are they looking?

353
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:30,611
No. They're actually going
to great lengths to avoid it.

354
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,246
Exactly. No one wants

355
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,582
to watch a handicap
struggle for independence.

356
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,685
This will buy us at least
15 minutes of averted gazes.

357
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:39,721
All right,
I'm gonna nail this home.

358
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:41,622
Oh! Oh, this is
so humiliating.

359
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:45,410
I'm about to be an
adult man crying.

360
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,854
I can't walk!

361
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:58,956
Why the hell
can't I walk?!

362
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:01,893
This isn't
part of the act anymore!

363
00:14:01,977 --> 00:14:03,878
No, no, no, no,
don't look.

364
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:06,080
If you make eye contact,
you'll have to help.

365
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:09,850
Hey, they're
getting away!

366
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:12,904
Release the dogs!

367
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:46,720
Oh, we did it!

368
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:48,022
Your plan worked, Joe!

369
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:49,941
I told you those guards
would turn away.

370
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,409
Yeah, Joe, that
was amazing!

371
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,845
That was easier than taking
candy from a premature baby.

372
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,102
I'm, uh...
I'm just gonna take this.

373
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:13,264
Hey, I got an idea

374
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,633
for something that's gonna
be so (bleep) funny.

375
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:19,404
Okay, Bonnie,
go get it.

376
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:21,038
It's in the closet.

377
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:24,058
Brian! Brian,
come out here!

378
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,676
What are you doing?!

379
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:26,894
I'm reading.

380
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:29,230
What... what... what...

381
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:31,065
What are you reading?

382
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,234
Well, I was just finishing
Jonathan Franzen's book.

383
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:35,236
You know, I'll admit
it has its moments,

384
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:36,737
but it's completely
overrated.

385
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:39,474
I mean, I'm not saying I
wrote something similar to it

386
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,142
several years ago,
but I am saying...

387
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,510
Grab him!

388
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:44,846
What? What? What? What?
Hey, what are you doing?! Hey!

389
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:46,664
- Get his paw! Hold still!
- Hey! Hey! Hey! What?

390
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:48,332
- Push him down onto all fours!
- No. What are you do...?

391
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,901
- I don't want to do this.
- If he really starts freaking out,

392
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:51,169
put your pinkie in his butt!
- Aah!

393
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:54,355
Calm down!
Calm down!

394
00:15:58,127 --> 00:15:59,627
Now Stewie!

395
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:02,430
All right, I guess
this is the night bitches die.

396
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:07,268
I wonder what the
chain gang did today.

397
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,187
I hope we're not
missing anything cool.

398
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:10,805
Maybe we should go back.

399
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:12,023
Hey, guys, look,
there's a house.

400
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,009
Maybe there's something inside

401
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:16,794
we can use
to get these chains off.

402
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,622
It looks like
nobody's home.

403
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:29,707
Hey, these look like
handcuff and shackle keys.

404
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:30,708
How do you know that?

405
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:34,045
These are handcuff
and shackle keys.

406
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,980
Hey, it worked!

407
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,901
You know, there's an awful lot
of pictures

408
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:41,469
of the sheriff in this house.

409
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:42,837
Well, he's a good-looking man.

410
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:45,573
I'll bet a lot of people
in town have pictures of him.

411
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:49,210
Oh, no! It's the sheriff!

412
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:50,611
Quick, into the closet!

413
00:16:58,036 --> 00:16:59,770
Who's there?

414
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,405
Just me, sweetie.

415
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:03,107
Oh, I didn't know
you were home.

416
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,976
What are you doing
in the closet there?

417
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:06,444
Um... wife things?

418
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:09,046
Oh, all right. Well, I'll only
be home for a minute.

419
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:10,748
Some prisoners escaped
from the work camp,

420
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:12,783
and I'm helping the warden
track 'em down.

421
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:15,353
Oh. Well, maybe you
should let 'em go.

422
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,071
You know I can't do that.

423
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:18,806
You're always working.

424
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:20,708
I wish you'd spend
more time at home.

425
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:22,043
More time with me.

426
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,277
Maybe you're right, honey.

427
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:24,745
Maybe I do work too much.

428
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:26,080
You know what?

429
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:27,915
I'm gonna let
those fugitives go.

430
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:29,317
You'd do that for me?

431
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:31,035
I'd do anything for you.

432
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:32,436
I love you.

433
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:33,938
I love you, too!

434
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:36,007
Now, come out here
and give me a kiss!

435
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:37,708
Peter, no!

436
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:39,677
Wait minute!
I don't have a wife!

437
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,078
Head for the tracks!

438
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,251
Oh, no!
They're shooting at us!

439
00:18:04,303 --> 00:18:06,354
Good thing bad guys are
such terrible shots.

440
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:09,040
Man, these guys are elusive!

441
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:10,558
Quick!
Hop on!

442
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,984
- All right, we did it.
- We made it.

443
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:21,819
That was a
close one!

444
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,404
Well, guys, we made it.

445
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:25,906
Boy, I feel like
I haven't eaten in a week.

446
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,408
Hey, if we pass
a McDaniel's

447
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:29,243
or a Burger Queen,
let's hop out.

448
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:30,995
Oh, that's right,
we're on television.

449
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,946
Oh, I'd love a
flame-broiled Bopper!

450
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:36,250
So frustrating. We all know
what we're talking about.

451
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:45,225
Well, this was
quite an adventure.

452
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:47,661
Yeah, it's good to be
back in familiar territory.

453
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:51,498
Where do y'all think
you're going?

454
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,617
You boys are fugitives
of my county,

455
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,752
and I'm gonna take you back.

456
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,937
Oh, no!

457
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,222
I don't think so.

458
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:01,158
You're in my jurisdiction now,
Sheriff Butt Breath.

459
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:08,215
Wow, Joe,
how'd you pull that off?

460
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:10,517
I put in a call from
the McDaniel's pay phone

461
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:13,086
while you guys were getting that
nine-piece chicken McFingers

462
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:15,789
and those Diet Conks
and those Fresh Fries.

463
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:18,258
Oh, come on. They-They
don't own "French fries!"

464
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:21,361
You know, you got some nerve
driving around my town

465
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:24,164
with a busted headlight.

466
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:27,534
And a busted windshield.

467
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,953
And an untreated flesh wound.

468
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:35,158
You took an oath just
the same as me, Sheriff.

469
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:36,627
To protect and serve.

470
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:38,395
Not to harass and douche.

471
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,147
Just 'cause you have
a badge doesn't mean

472
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:42,065
you can treat people
any way you like.

473
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,984
And as a law enforcement
professional,

474
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:46,103
you have an obligation to be
more ethically upstanding

475
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:49,439
than the average man, not less.

476
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:52,209
Now, get the hell
out of my town.

477
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:02,319
Nice going, Joe!

478
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,488
Well, it's great
being back in the North

479
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:05,956
where people
are civilized.

480
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:08,942
Hey, what, are you guys
all on a date?

481
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,978
Gay!

482
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:16,583
Oh, my God, Peter,
what an experience.

483
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:19,519
But the important thing is
you're home safe.

484
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:22,422
Yeah. And you know, I guess I
learned something from all this.

485
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,857
You know what?

486
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,709
We've done this a billion
times, so you know what?

487
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:28,445
I'm just gonna
do the cadences.
