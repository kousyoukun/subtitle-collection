So, Cleveland,
you got to be pretty psyched

13
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:37,081
about President Ubama, huh?

14
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:38,600
W-What?

15
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,685
Well, I mean, you remember how
a lot of people said, like,

16
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:42,303
"Oh, Ubama's not gonna
be able to do it,"

17
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:43,538
but he's-he's
hanging in there.

18
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:45,223
Peter, it's "Obama."

19
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,191
Eh, You-bama, Me-bama,
We-bama, who cares?

20
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,477
It's a black guy in a suit,
let's just marvel at that.

21
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:50,945
Gosh, Cleveland,
it sure is great

22
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:53,498
having you back at The Clam,
even if it's just for a week.

26
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:00,955
Aw, Peter,
you're using the song!

27
00:01:01,023 --> 00:01:02,223
Thank you.

28
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,625
Well, the numbers
ain't so good,

29
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:05,543
so we got to do everything
we can-- Hello, Lois.

30
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,095
Peter, where the hell are you?

31
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:09,480
You told me you were gonna clean
out those boxes in the basement

32
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:10,682
and put them in the attic.

33
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:12,133
Lois, it just sounds like
busy work.

34
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:13,551
It is busy work.

35
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,553
I'm trying to keep you
off the streets and off drugs.

36
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:17,622
I'm selling those candy bars!

37
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:22,593
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you
want to buy some candy bars

38
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:24,963
so we can get some new uniforms
for our baseball team?

39
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,881
Where'd you get
those candy bars?

40
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:29,567
Peter, I need you home.

41
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:31,736
You also promised you'd fix
that shelf in the garage.

42
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:32,937
Oh, Lois, I'm losing you.

43
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:36,407
Hello? Hello?

44
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:37,408
Hello?

45
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:38,660
Oh, hey, Lois.

46
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:40,361
This is somebody else now.

47
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:42,263
There must've been
a cross connection.

48
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,399
My name is Mike,
and I'm somewhere else

49
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:45,667
trying to make my own call.

50
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,068
Fine, Mike.

51
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:49,203
You tell Peter he's in trouble
when he gets home.

52
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:51,973
You can tell him yourself,
because Mike is Peter!

53
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,107
Oh, my God.

54
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:54,342
Are you serious?

55
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,910
That was very good, Peter.

56
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:57,011
I know!

57
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,446
Geez.

58
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:00,631
That's all my life is lately,
just a bunch of chores.

59
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:03,167
I'm sick of Lois always
making me do stupid stuff.

60
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:04,535
I know what you're saying,
Peter.

61
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:05,903
Bonnie's always making me do

62
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,306
all these impossible
household tasks.

63
00:02:08,374 --> 00:02:09,841
Joe, make sure you get

64
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:12,210
all the tire tracks
out of the carpet.

65
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:24,872
Learn to live with it, Bonnie!

66
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,074
There are tracks!

67
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,608
People make tracks!

68
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:28,810
Boy, I hear you, too.

69
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:30,311
It's a lot of work
just to keep

70
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,046
my single guy fridge
sufficiently depressing.

71
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:34,549
Let's see.

72
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:36,150
Ex-girlfriend's Yoplait.

73
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:37,719
Root beer from two Julys ago.

74
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:39,387
Here we go, expired milk.

75
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:43,925
Oh, my God, Jenny,
look how young you look.

76
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:45,660
I sympathize with y'all.

77
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:50,131
Donna makes me listen to Gayle
King on XM Radio 19 hours a day.

78
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,766
I tried to kill myself by

79
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,368
swallowing a nail clipper,
but I passed it.

80
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:55,837
What the hell
happened to us?

81
00:02:55,904 --> 00:02:57,972
We used to be able to do
whatever the hell we wanted.

82
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,640
Now here we are,
in the prime of our lives,

83
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,392
and we're slaves to our women.

84
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,327
I know. An exciting
day for me

85
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:05,196
is when I watch
wheelchair porn.

86
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:06,864
Boy, do the sparks
fly on those.

87
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:08,366
Oh, is it hot?

88
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:11,519
Nah, it's mostly just chairs
smashing into each other.

89
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:13,821
Sometimes the director
has to come on camera

90
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,323
just to turn the
chairs around.

91
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,175
Well, why don't we make
our own excitement?

92
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:18,876
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, like,

93
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:20,011
maybe the four
of us should

94
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,212
do something
to reclaim our freedom.

95
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:22,847
Like go on a road trip,
find some adventure.

96
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:24,449
Quagmire,
that's a great idea!

97
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:25,967
Let's do a road trip!
Who's in?

98
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:29,821
No. No, no.

99
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:31,389
No, n-not you, Seamus.

100
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:32,457
Ah, poo.

101
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:37,728
All right, listen up, ladies.

102
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:40,364
We got something to say and we
ain't taking "no" for an answer.

103
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:41,799
We are going on a road trip.

104
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:43,317
We don't know how long
we'll be gone,

105
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:45,186
and don't expect a call
from us to check in.

106
00:03:45,254 --> 00:03:47,421
This trip is about men
being men.

107
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,490
We will drive
after a couple of beers

108
00:03:49,558 --> 00:03:51,275
and not make a big
federal case about it.

109
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:53,611
We're gonna sneeze and not
put our hand over.

110
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,580
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop us!

111
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:56,714
Yeah, okay with me.

112
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:57,615
- Sure.
- Fine.

113
00:03:57,683 --> 00:03:59,050
That'll be nice.

114
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:00,585
It'll give us a chance
to have some girl time.

115
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:02,720
Oh. All right, then.

116
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:03,888
Where are you boys going?

117
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:05,056
We're going to New Orleans.

118
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:06,924
The party capital of America.

119
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,193
Home of the
All-You-Can-Pee Street.

120
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:12,029
I'll tell you one thing, it's
all about the beads down there.

121
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,756
We all know
what's going on here.

122
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,658
It's just implied,
but we all know

123
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:25,243
what's going on
in this thought bubble.

124
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:27,195
The kids don't know, but we do.

125
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,296
Boy, I'm sure getting my money's
worth out of this rental car.

126
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,764
Okay, all right,
I got one.

127
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:49,383
Would you rather be a hobo
with a five percent chance

128
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,302
of getting inherited
by a rich guy

129
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:54,472
or be Hitler two years before
the end of World War II?

130
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:56,390
'Cause you know you're gonna
have to shoot yourself,

131
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,109
but you still got two
more years as Hitler.

132
00:04:58,193 --> 00:04:59,894
If you're the hobo, do you, uh,

133
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:02,263
have a place to sleep,
like an underpass or...?

134
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:03,264
Different every night.

135
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,949
As Hitler, can I change

136
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,934
certain policies
so that maybe I'm looked on

137
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:08,819
more favorably
at the end of the war?

138
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:11,205
No, you already screwed up
big-time-- lot of dead Jews.

139
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:13,958
Am I a blue state
or a red state hobo?

140
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:16,443
Blue, but
Midwestern blue.

141
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:17,995
Oh, boy.

142
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,047
I don't think so,
it's cold out there.

143
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:21,448
Am I allowed
to alter the mustache?

144
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,467
Dude, why do you keep
trying to make Hitler work?

145
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:26,787
Am I allowed to kill other hobos
to increase my odds?

146
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:28,306
Kill anyone you
like; you're a hobo.

147
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,840
Am I a walking hobo?

148
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:31,809
No. Quagmire and Cleveland
are, but you're not.

149
00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:33,844
So, wait, I would also
be a paralyzed Hitler?

150
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,096
Yeah.

151
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:36,731
Would I be
a black Hitler?

152
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:38,316
Yes. No.

153
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,484
Well, wait a minute,
now how come I got to be

154
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,019
crippled Hitler
and he's still white Hitler?

155
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:44,188
If you got such a problem with
it, Joe, just be the hobo!

156
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:45,439
This one isn't very fun.

157
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,275
Wait a minute, where are we?

158
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:49,744
Yeah, this doesn't look like
the main highway anymore.

159
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:50,995
You think we made
a wrong turn?

160
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,146
I hope not.

161
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:53,781
These backwoods parts
of the Deep South

162
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:55,700
ain't a place
you want to get lost in.

163
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:58,452
Oh, no.

164
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:03,224
Don't worry
about it, guys.

165
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,259
I read nowhere that Southern
sheriffs really want

166
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:07,161
to be talked down to by
big-shot Northerners.

167
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:10,481
Afternoon.

168
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:11,983
Officer, what is it?

169
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,951
We are in a tremendous
urban rush.

170
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:16,053
You fellas ain't from
around here, are you?

171
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:17,888
Hey, Sheriff,
I'm trying to learn Southern.

172
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:19,257
Is this saying anything?

173
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:21,525
A-doy-doy-doy-doy!

174
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:24,128
We're very sorry, Sheriff,
and we want to cooperate

175
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:25,896
to the fullest extent possible.

176
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:26,981
You threatening me?

177
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:28,115
Uh, no, sir.

178
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:29,717
Who you calling "sir," boy?

179
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:32,353
I'm an officer of the law,
paid by this county.

180
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:34,922
And I can't help noticing
you got a headlight out.

181
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,324
Really?
I don't see any...

182
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:40,328
And I see that turn signal
ain't working neither.

183
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:42,396
Now, look, sir,

184
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:43,898
I'm a police officer, too.

185
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,967
I know all the games;
I use them myself.

186
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:48,219
So what do you say
we just work something out?

187
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:49,503
So, you're a cop, huh?

188
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:51,973
Let me see your badge.

189
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:55,376
Looks like you're
a civilian now.

190
00:06:55,444 --> 00:06:58,145
I'm gonna have to
search your vehicle.

191
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:00,982
Well, lookie here.

192
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:02,700
What do we got in this thing?

193
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,752
Oh, come on!
You planted that there!

194
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,920
We had drugs?

195
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:07,721
Oh, my God,
why am I driving drunk

196
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:09,073
when I could've been
driving high?

197
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:11,242
You boys are in
a lot of trouble.

198
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,110
Dispatch,
Sheriff Nichols.

199
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:14,328
Bringing in four
perpetrators

200
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:16,063
under suspicion of
drug possession.

201
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:18,432
Descriptions: one
African-American,

202
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,334
one crippled, one
skinny, one handsome.

203
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:21,635
Yes.

204
00:07:21,703 --> 00:07:23,704
You're all coming down
to the station with me.

205
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:24,739
Aw, crap!

206
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:26,307
Hang on, hang on,
you guys.

207
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,908
Don't worry. I know how to
speak this guy's language.

208
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,012
Keith Urban.

209
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,446
Go on.

210
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:34,448
Brett Favre.

211
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:35,483
Uh-huh.

212
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,518
I'm listening.

213
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:39,253
William H. Macy?

214
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:41,455
You guys are going
away for a long time.

215
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:54,047
Look at this, Cleveland.

216
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:55,798
Front of the bus,
back of the bus,

217
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:57,634
middle of the bus--
you guys are doing great.

218
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,885
I can't believe this.

219
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:00,720
Two weeks in prison
on trumped-up charges.

220
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:02,655
That trial was a total sham.

221
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:05,091
Yeah, I knew we were in trouble
the minute I saw the jury.

222
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:09,445
Well, at least they're
a jury of our peers.

223
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:11,581
I don't think they see it
that way, Peter.

224
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:20,023
Hello, gentlemen.

225
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,524
I am the warden.

226
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:24,260
You are here
because you are criminals.

227
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:25,695
This is not a resort.

228
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:27,830
You will be worked harder
than you have ever

229
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:30,550
been worked in your miserable,
pathetic lives.

230
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:32,568
And play
harder, right?

231
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:33,736
I bet.

232
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,704
Step forward, maggot!

233
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:40,059
Next time, that'll be you.

234
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:42,028
Well, why wasn't
it him this time?!

235
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:44,063
Oh, I'm so scared.

236
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,766
Peter, stop it!

237
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,202
Yeah, you're real big when
you got that stick, ain't you?

238
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,436
Okay, I'll stop now.

239
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:55,742
This is so much fun,
isn't it?

240
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:56,776
I know.

241
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:58,177
What should we talk
about next?

242
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:00,113
I know, let's talk
about actresses.

243
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,280
Ooh, yeah.

244
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:03,282
I feel like Natalie Portman

245
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,785
thinks she's so much better
than everybody.

246
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:08,121
She's nothing, and her
husband's a nobody.

247
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:09,522
Why does Laura
Linney always

248
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,907
look like she's just
finished skiing?

249
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:12,308
I don't know
who that is.

250
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:14,610
Really? <i>The Big C?</i>
<i>Love Actually?</i>

251
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:15,912
No, never heard of her.

252
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,213
Would you know
who she was

253
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:18,948
if I said Tyler
Perry's Laura Linney?

254
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,316
Ooh, I love her.

255
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,974
Oh, God, it's so hot out here.

256
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,059
Yeah, you knew it was
gonna be hot when you heard

257
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:32,395
that lonesome slide guitar
and that hawk's cry.

258
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,468
Hey! This ain't break time!

259
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:41,154

Oh, yeah, thanks.

283
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:30,837
What the hell is that?

284
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:32,105
It's a jet pack.

285
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,090
I'll come back for you guys,
I promise.

286
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:41,230
You're my friend and everything
and I feel bad saying this,

287
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:43,433
but I wanted to see you fail.

288
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:55,878
Official prediction:
when they let us out of here,

289
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,114
we're gonna have to go through
the prison gift shop.

290
00:10:58,182 --> 00:10:59,982
Oh, I hate doing that.

291
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,551
That's how
they get you.

292
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:04,020
Man, it's gonna feel so good
to walk out of here tomorrow.

293
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,255
Yeah, you know,
the time actually went by faster

294
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:07,457
than I would have thought.

295
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:09,192
Uh, you know something?

296
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:10,893
We left Quahog to find adventure

297
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,396
and get away from all
those lame chores at home,

298
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,031
but I'll tell you this.

299
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:18,267
Looking back on it now, I don't
think our lives are so bad.

300
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,169
Yeah, I sure do miss Lois
and the kids.

301
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:21,504
I'll tell you one thing.

302
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:23,539
When I get home,
I'm gonna sleep like a log.

303
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:26,559
Hey, I'm gonna plug in the
night-light if you don't mind.

304
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:27,977
Actually, you know what?

305
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:30,580
I'm gonna go ahead and
ask you to not do that.

306
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:33,199
Knock off that chitchat!
It's lights out!

307
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:35,501
Oh, hey, Warden, since
it's our last night in here,

308
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,336
can I have a glass of milk?

309
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:38,805
I feel like having
dream diarrhea.

310
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,490
Last night?

311
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:42,225
Where do you think
y'all are going?

312
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:45,361
Says here you got another
30 days on your sentence.

313
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:47,997
What?! But the court said we're
supposed to go home tomorrow!

314
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:50,066
Well, the court
ain't here, is it?

315
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:54,353
Oh, man, how the hell
are we gonna do this

316
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:55,521
for another 30 days?

317
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:58,925
That's the way
it goes around here.

318
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:01,594
Once you come in,
you're never allowed to leave.

319
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:04,263
I got my sentence extended
30 days once.

320
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:06,666
That was 45 years ago.

321
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,084
Oh, my God,
you hear that?

322
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:09,585
We're gonna be stuck
in here forever!

323
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:11,304
Oh, God, what are we gonna do?

324
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:12,805
Well, I know
what I'm gonna do.

325
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:14,507
If we're gonna be here a while,

326
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:17,343
I'm gonna find the biggest guy
here and kick his ass.

327
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,544
Wait a minute.
That's me!

328
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,696
Oh, no, I have a knife!

329
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,317
Oh, what are we gonna do?!

330
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:31,519
They're gonna keep us
locked up here forever!

331
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,338
We're not staying
in here forever.

332
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:34,973
- We're getting out of here.
- How?

333
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,524
We're breaking out.

334
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:37,325
What?

335
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:38,710
Look, sometimes in life,

336
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:41,062
you got to say, "What the hell,"
and just go for it.

337
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,964
I mean, that's how
we won the Revolutionary War.

338
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:46,568
Colonel, the British are too
entrenched across the river.

339
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,369
I've told the men
we'll hold our position.

340
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,259
Negative. Tell the men,
we're going across.

341
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:55,894
But Colonel Goatbanger,
we've...

342
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:57,445
No, we need to do this,

343
00:12:57,513 --> 00:12:59,180
'cause... for...
'cause of... for strategy.

344
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:06,888
All right, if we're
gonna break out of here,

345
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:08,323
we got to get past
these guards.

346
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,791
Well, I got an idea.

347
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,776
It won't be pretty,
but bear with me.

348
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:15,346
Oh, no, I fell out
of my wheelchair!

349
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
Don't help me!

350
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:21,136
I need to do this on my own!

351
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:23,171
What are you doing, Joe?
You're embarrassing us.

352
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,572
Oh, really?
Are they looking?

353
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:30,411
No. They're actually going
to great lengths to avoid it.

354
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:32,046
Exactly. No one wants

355
00:13:32,114 --> 00:13:34,382
to watch a handicap
struggle for independence.

356
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,485
This will buy us at least
15 minutes of averted gazes.

357
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:39,521
All right,
I'm gonna nail this home.

358
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:41,422
Oh! Oh, this is
so humiliating.

359
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:45,210
I'm about to be an
adult man crying.

360
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,654
I can't walk!

361
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:58,756
Why the hell
can't I walk?!

362
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:01,693
This isn't
part of the act anymore!

363
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:03,678
No, no, no, no,
don't look.

364
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,880
If you make eye contact,
you'll have to help.

365
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,650
Hey, they're
getting away!

366
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:12,704
Release the dogs!

367
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:46,520
Oh, we did it!

368
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:47,822
Your plan worked, Joe!

369
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:49,741
I told you those guards
would turn away.

370
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:51,209
Yeah, Joe, that
was amazing!

371
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:53,645
That was easier than taking
candy from a premature baby.

372
00:14:57,883 --> 00:15:00,902
I'm, uh...
I'm just gonna take this.

373
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:13,064
Hey, I got an idea

374
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:15,433
for something that's gonna
be so (bleep) funny.

375
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:19,204
Okay, Bonnie,
go get it.

376
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:20,838
It's in the closet.

377
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:23,858
Brian! Brian,
come out here!

378
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:25,476
What are you doing?!

379
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:26,694
I'm reading.

380
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:29,030
What... what... what...

381
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:30,865
What are you reading?

382
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:33,034
Well, I was just finishing
Jonathan Franzen's book.

383
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:35,036
You know, I'll admit
it has its moments,

384
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:36,537
but it's completely
overrated.

385
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:39,274
I mean, I'm not saying I
wrote something similar to it

386
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:40,942
several years ago,
but I am saying...

387
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,310
Grab him!

388
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:44,646
What? What? What? What?
Hey, what are you doing?! Hey!

389
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:46,464
- Get his paw! Hold still!
- Hey! Hey! Hey! What?

390
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:48,132
- Push him down onto all fours!
- No. What are you do...?

391
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,701
- I don't want to do this.
- If he really starts freaking out,

392
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:50,969
put your pinkie in his butt!
- Aah!

393
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:54,155
Calm down!
Calm down!

394
00:15:57,927 --> 00:15:59,427
Now Stewie!

395
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:02,230
All right, I guess
this is the night bitches die.

396
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:07,068
I wonder what the
chain gang did today.

397
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:08,987
I hope we're not
missing anything cool.

398
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:10,605
Maybe we should go back.

399
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:11,823
Hey, guys, look,
there's a house.

400
00:16:13,392 --> 00:16:14,809
Maybe there's something inside

401
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:16,594
we can use
to get these chains off.

402
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,422
It looks like
nobody's home.

403
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:29,507
Hey, these look like
handcuff and shackle keys.

404
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:30,508
How do you know that?

405
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:33,845
These are handcuff
and shackle keys.

406
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,780
Hey, it worked!

407
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,701
You know, there's an awful lot
of pictures

408
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:41,269
of the sheriff in this house.

409
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:42,637
Well, he's a good-looking man.

410
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:45,373
I'll bet a lot of people
in town have pictures of him.

411
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:49,010
Oh, no! It's the sheriff!

412
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:50,411
Quick, into the closet!

413
00:16:57,836 --> 00:16:59,570
Who's there?

414
00:16:59,638 --> 00:17:01,205
Just me, sweetie.

415
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:02,907
Oh, I didn't know
you were home.

416
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,776
What are you doing
in the closet there?

417
00:17:04,843 --> 00:17:06,244
Um... wife things?

418
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:08,846
Oh, all right. Well, I'll only
be home for a minute.

419
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:10,548
Some prisoners escaped
from the work camp,

420
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,583
and I'm helping the warden
track 'em down.

421
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,153
Oh. Well, maybe you
should let 'em go.

422
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,871
You know I can't do that.

423
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:18,606
You're always working.

424
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:20,508
I wish you'd spend
more time at home.

425
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:21,843
More time with me.

426
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,077
Maybe you're right, honey.

427
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,545
Maybe I do work too much.

428
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:25,880
You know what?

429
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:27,715
I'm gonna let
those fugitives go.

430
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:29,117
You'd do that for me?

431
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:30,835
I'd do anything for you.

432
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:32,236
I love you.

433
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:33,738
I love you, too!

434
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:35,807
Now, come out here
and give me a kiss!

435
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:37,508
Peter, no!

436
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:39,477
Wait minute!
I don't have a wife!

437
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:57,878
Head for the tracks!

438
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:04,051
Oh, no!
They're shooting at us!

439
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:06,154
Good thing bad guys are
such terrible shots.

440
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:08,840
Man, these guys are elusive!

441
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:10,358
Quick!
Hop on!

442
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:19,784
- All right, we did it.
- We made it.

443
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:21,619
That was a
close one!

444
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:23,204
Well, guys, we made it.

445
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:25,706
Boy, I feel like
I haven't eaten in a week.

446
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:27,208
Hey, if we pass
a McDaniel's

447
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:29,043
or a Burger Queen,
let's hop out.

448
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:30,795
Oh, that's right,
we're on television.

449
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:32,746
Oh, I'd love a
flame-broiled Bopper!

450
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,050
So frustrating. We all know
what we're talking about.

451
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:44,425
Well, this was
quite an adventure.

452
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:46,861
Yeah, it's good to be
back in familiar territory.

453
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:50,698
Where do y'all think
you're going?

454
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:52,817
You boys are fugitives
of my county,

455
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:54,952
and I'm gonna take you back.

456
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,137
Oh, no!

457
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:57,422
I don't think so.

458
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:00,358
You're in my jurisdiction now,
Sheriff Butt Breath.

459
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:07,415
Wow, Joe,
how'd you pull that off?

460
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:09,717
I put in a call from
the McDaniel's pay phone

461
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:12,286
while you guys were getting that
nine-piece chicken McFingers

462
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:14,989
and those Diet Conks
and those Fresh Fries.

463
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:17,458
Oh, come on. They-They
don't own "French fries!"

464
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:20,561
You know, you got some nerve
driving around my town

465
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:23,364
with a busted headlight.

466
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:26,734
And a busted windshield.

467
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,153
And an untreated flesh wound.

468
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:34,358
You took an oath just
the same as me, Sheriff.

469
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:35,827
To protect and serve.

470
00:19:35,894 --> 00:19:37,595
Not to harass and douche.

471
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,347
Just 'cause you have
a badge doesn't mean

472
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:41,265
you can treat people
any way you like.

473
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,184
And as a law enforcement
professional,

474
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:45,303
you have an obligation to be
more ethically upstanding

475
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:48,639
than the average man, not less.

476
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:51,409
Now, get the hell
out of my town.

477
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:01,519
Nice going, Joe!

478
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:03,688
Well, it's great
being back in the North

479
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,156
where people
are civilized.

480
00:20:05,224 --> 00:20:08,142
Hey, what, are you guys
all on a date?

481
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,178
Gay!

482
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:15,783
Oh, my God, Peter,
what an experience.

483
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:18,719
But the important thing is
you're home safe.

484
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:21,622
Yeah. And you know, I guess I
learned something from all this.

485
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,057
You know what?

486
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,909
We've done this a billion
times, so you know what?

487
00:20:24,977 --> 00:20:27,645
I'm just gonna
do the cadences.

488
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:47,762
