NEWSCASTER:
And we're back with our coverage

13
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:38,495
of the Quahog
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

14
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:39,847
Happy Turkey Day, Quahog.

15
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,615
This is Tom Tucker
and Joyce Kinney

16
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:42,850
live at the parade.

17
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,019
We've got some on-and-off
drizzle here today,

18
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,754
and we're a little w,
as you can see,

19
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:49,886
because, apparently, there are
no awnings that exist anywhere.

20
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:51,813
There's your top news
story right there.

21
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:54,349
Mysterious awning
shortage ravages the Northeast,

22
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,812
but miraculously has not
affected Channels 2 or 6.

23
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:01,616
No no. Keep the camera
over there.

24
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:02,651
I want everyone to see it.

25
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:04,819
This is why we're third.

26
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:07,155
And here comes our first
float of the day, Tom.

27
00:01:07,223 --> 00:01:09,457
It's the James Woods
High football team

28
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:11,076
with their
"Not Gay Revue."

29
00:01:11,143 --> 00:01:12,477
(upbeat music plays)

30
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:14,613
♪ We just won the big game ♪

31
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,847

00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:27,777
And here comes the Rocky and
Bullwinkle float. (car alarm blaring)

39
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:30,362
Always a popular sight
here at the par...

40
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:32,230
S-Somebody want
to handle that?

41
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:33,398
Does some--
does some--

44
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:38,403
You're kidding.

45
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:39,738
Well, viewers,
to top it off,

46
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:42,073
that's the Channel 5
news van you're hearing.

47
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:44,943
Ph-Phil, Phil just open it--
unlock the doors.

48
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:47,245
You don't have to put
the key in the ignition.

49
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:49,381
Well, open the
driver's side first.

50
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:51,383
Okay, well, I guess
it's broken, then,

51
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,751
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

52
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:54,019
Okay, happy Thanksgiving,
Quahog.

53
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:55,120
Here's a car alarm.

54
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:56,404
(alarm continues blaring)
(sighs)

55
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:57,772
All right, well,
I guess we'll just...

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,207
(alarm stops with a tweet)
Ahhh, there we go.

57
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:00,358
(doorbell rings)

58
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:01,676
Oh, that must be
Joe and Bonnie.

59
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:03,678
Now remember everyone,
let's be cheerful,

60
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,814
'cause Thanksgivings
are very hard for them.

61
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:07,349
'Cause Joe can't walk?
No.

62
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,718
'Cause his bum doesn't
open up to poo anymore,

63
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:11,686
and a nurse has to
go digging up there

64
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:13,271
to get up after
his stuff?

65
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:14,272
(laughs)

66
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,390
Oh, my God!

67
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,491
(laughs)
I know.

68
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,026
That was told to me
in confidence.

69
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:19,694
No. Don't you
remember, Peter?

70
00:02:19,762 --> 00:02:21,046
It was
on Thanksgiving

71
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:22,814
that their son Kevin
got killed in Iraq.

72
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,200
Look who's here!

73
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:26,618
Happy Thanksgiving.

74
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:27,802
Gobble gobble.

75
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,205
You guys, thanks so much
for having us over.

76
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,807
Well, we're just glad we
can have people over again

77
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,275
now that that giant
crab's gone.

78
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:36,428
Hey, guys, how ya doin'?
Come on in.

79
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:38,213
(rapid staccato):
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

80
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:39,514
No-no-no-no-no,
no-no-no-no-no.

81
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:40,665
Just go around it.

82
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:41,516
He's not gonna
hurt ya.

83
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,801
Just go around it.

84
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:43,835
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

85
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:44,803
No-no-no-no-no,
no-no-no-no-no.

86
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:45,937
No-no-no-no-no.

87
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:47,338
All right, try just
going under him.

88
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,940
I think we should
probably just go home.

89
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:50,225
Maybe we'll do it
another time.

90
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:51,142
No-no-no-no-no.

91
00:02:58,234 --> 00:02:59,184
What the hell?

92
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,201
Mom!

93
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:01,286
Mom, it's me! Mom!

94
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:03,021
Oh, yeah, it's a baby.

95
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:04,689
It's a big balloon, baby,

96
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:06,024
just like you're a baby.

97
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,058
No, it's me!

98
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:08,076
It's a balloon of me!

99
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:09,461
Peter, come
look at this.

100
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:11,996
He sees a baby and knows
that he's also a baby.

101
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:13,231
So smart.

102
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,933
Mama's smart little boy.

103
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,634
Aah, check out Quagmire.

104
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:18,036
It's been a year and a half,

105
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:20,388
and he still looks
uncomfortable around his dad.

106
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:22,023
Well, it's a
big adjustment.

107
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:25,093
After all, his dad did have
a sex-change operation.

108
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,696
So, uh...
how-how are things, Dad?

109
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:31,032
Oh, Glenn, I can't tell you how
wonderful it is to be back here.

110
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,351
This is gonna be a really
special Thanksgiving.

111
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:35,286
Happy Thanksgiving!

112
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:36,838
We brought
chicken wings.

113
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:39,607
Oh, yum. I hope they're the
kind with the bone removed.

114
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:42,343
(doorbell rings)

115
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:44,696
Hey, Aunt Carol.

116
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:45,764
Hey, Uncle Adam.

♪ La la la la la. ♪

118
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,367
Don't mention last night's
<i>Project Runway.</i>

119
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:50,869
I've got it on TiVo.

120
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,203
Happy Thanksgiving.

121
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:53,855
I brought Marshmallow Peeps.

122
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:54,856
Oh.

123
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:56,057
Okay.

124
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,293
I'm gonna need
that Pyrex dish back.

125
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,494
Okay.

126
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:01,529
I'm gonna need it back now.

127
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:02,764
Oh.

128
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,683
I don't want
anything else today

129
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:07,752
to get as tense
as that just got.

130
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,554
Carol, it's so good
to see you.

131
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:10,855
You, too, Lois.

132
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:12,524
God, that is
one nice ass.

133
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:13,958
Thank you.
You're welcome.

134
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:15,794
(TV playing)

135
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:16,961
This is nice.

136
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,630
This is very nice,

137
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:20,765
the time that we're spending
together right now.

138
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,766
Easy, Joe.

139
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:22,867
(groans)

140
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:24,903
Sorry.
Just making mental memories

141
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,905
for when you're all
inevitably dead,

142
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:28,239
and I'm left alone.

143
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:30,041
Geez. Quagmire, help me out
with this.

144
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:31,543
No, he's right.
I mean, sometimes

145
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,545
chicks die, and it's
not anyone's fault.

146
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:36,481
Okay, everyone, it's 2:30.
Time for dinner.

147
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:39,984
'Cause on Thanksgiving, 2:30
is dinnertime for some reason.

148
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:44,656
Oh, my.

149
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:47,025
Lois, those sweet potatoes
look delicious.

150
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:48,526
That's the
stuffing, Ma.

151
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:51,329
Now put on your glasses before
you run over another black guy.

152
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:52,964
Oh, this looks fantastic.

153
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:54,983
I can't wait to poop this out.

154
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:56,301
Hey! Who's gonna get

155
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:58,436
the Thanksgiving dump trophy
this year?

156
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,171
You are!
Dad's gonna get it!

157
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,105
Who else?

158
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:02,157
(all laughing)

159
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:03,942
Loving.
Loving family.

160
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,977
Well, dig in, everyone!

161
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,783
Hello, Ida.
Hello, Brian.

162
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:13,685
How have you been?
Very well, thank you.

163
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:16,688
He threw up when he found out
you were a monster.

164
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,090
This food is so (bleep) good,
Lois.

165
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:21,459
Oh. Okay.
Wow.

166
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:23,795
MAN: Hey! Is there room at that table
for one more?

167
00:05:23,863 --> 00:05:25,363
(all gasp)

168
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:28,917
Oh, my God!

169
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:30,485
Kevin Swanson!

170
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:32,353
Son, you're alive!

171
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:35,323
Aw, and I stayed up all night
writing dead kid jokes.

172
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:37,058
All right, you know what,
I'm gonna do one anyway.

173
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,393
Kevin, go back outside.

174
00:05:38,477 --> 00:05:39,944
Everybody pretend
this didn't happen.

175
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:43,581
Hey, Joe, what's your favorite
preparation of a tomato?

176
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:46,351
Is it son-died tomato?

177
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:50,388
Is it son-died tomato?

178
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:52,023
Okay, Kevin, you
can come back in.

179
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:53,357
Welcome home, soldier.

180
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:54,359
(chuckles)

181
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:56,027
Son-died tomato.

182
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,845
(slide whistle squeaks)

183
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:04,685
Kevin, you're alive!

184
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:05,619
I don't believe it.

185
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,688
Oh, my God, it's a miracle!

186
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:09,523
Well, I guess
you replaced real butter

187
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:10,891
as the star of the dinner.

188
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,426
But I don't understand.

189
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:14,195
The Army said you'd
been killed in action.

190
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:15,162
What happened?

191
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,932
Well, it's quite a story.

192
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,435
<i>In some ways, Army life in Iraq</i>
<i>is what you'd expect,</i>

193
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,170
<i>what with the blistering heat,</i>

194
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:24,939
<i>the constant sense</i>
<i>of impending danger,</i>

195
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:26,774
<i>and the one gay soldier</i>

196
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:28,409
<i>awkwardly avoiding</i>
<i>the use of pronouns.</i>

197
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:30,811
Man, I sure miss my
sweetheart back home.

198
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,030
I can't wait to get
back to that person.

199
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:34,699
Chow time, boys.

200
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,500
Yes, sir, Sergeant
Major General Captain!

201
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:38,335
Ah, come on, boys,
it's Thanksgiving.

202
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:40,237
Call me Major
General Captain.

203
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:41,489
Now you eat up.

204
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,710
I don't trust that turkey
those Iraqis made.

205
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:47,328
Ah, you're all wet, Swanson.

206
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,329
I call the white meat.

207
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,714
I call the dark meat.

208
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:51,332
I call the cell phone
duct-taped to the side!

209
00:06:51,383 --> 00:06:52,216
Noooooo!

210
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:58,222
They're all dead, sir,
except for Swanson.

211
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,491
He's in a coma, but he's
unlikely to recover.

212
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,277
Okay, well, just send Swanson's
parents a letter saying

213
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:05,479
that he's dead, 'cause
those are already printed.

214
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:07,081
You know what? Send one
to my parents, too.

215
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:10,084
I spent five years in a
Kuwait military hospital.

216
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:12,002
I woke up from
the coma last week,

217
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,404
and I flew straight here.

218
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:15,122
Kind of a
Thanksgiving surprise.

219
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,058
Hey, when you get sexually
abused while you're in a coma,

220
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:19,543
do you know
it's happening

221
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:20,995
and just can't do
anything about it?

222
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:22,630
Or do u not even
know what's going on?

223
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:24,365
I also am curious about that.

224
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:26,000
Hey, Kevin, you know
I put a yellow ribbon

225
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,401
on my car for you guys?

226
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:30,137
And-and a little thing that says
"I support the troops."

227
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:32,640
'Cause there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you guys.

228
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:35,042
but I don't have
any change on me right now.

229
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,661
Well, all that matters
is that my boy is home.

230
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,831
Kevin, I want you to meet
your little sister, Susie.

231
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:41,832
Wow.

232
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,000
Hey, little sis.

233
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:44,668
I guess we got
some catching up to do, huh?

234
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:45,836
Hope you
don't get scared

235
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:47,571
when I scream and
have night terrors.

236
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,706
SUSIE: (à la Patrick Stewart):
<i>It's quite all right.</i>

237
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:49,874
I've seen worse.

238
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:51,075
(horror movie score plays)

239
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:52,610
(woman screams on TV)

240
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,411
SUSIE: (à la Patrick Stewart):
<i>A human centipede.</i>

241
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,746
<i>How ghastly.</i>

242
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:58,215
Your mother and I are
very proud of you, Kevin.

243
00:07:58,283 --> 00:07:59,617
You're a war hero.

244
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:01,218
I don't feel
like a war hero.

245
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:02,920
Only a war hero
would say that.

246
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:05,523
Hey, so what about the female
soldiers over there?

247
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,824
Were they able to contribute?

248
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:08,476
Eh, you know,
they did their best.

249
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:10,044
What with their
regular bleedings

250
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,862
when they got shot,
did they even know?

251
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,564
Look, guys,
I'm not a hero.

252
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:15,749
And I don't want to be treated
any different than before.

253
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:16,951
Just that you would say that

254
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,619
means we should treat you
different.

255
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,223
Come on, guys, let's give him
all our best food.

256
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,525
Okay, now you eat up, and then
we're all gonna go out back

257
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:27,361
and play some Thanksgiving touch
football-- excuse me:

258
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:30,064
war hero Thanksgiving
touch football.

259
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,687
Yeaaaaah!

260
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:37,988
U.S.A.!

261
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:39,273
I didn't even know
there was a war.

262
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,210
Okay, let's pick teams.

263
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:44,512
I'll be a captain,

264
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:46,764
and, uh, Mayor West,
you can be a captain.

265
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:48,432
All right.
I pick <i>you.</i>

266
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,718
You can't pick me;
I'm a captain.

267
00:08:50,785 --> 00:08:53,888
No one had ever stood up to me
like that before.

268
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:56,040
I respected him
from there on out.

269
00:08:56,107 --> 00:08:57,541
That's a great
story, Grandpa.

270
00:08:57,609 --> 00:08:59,093
I didn't like it.

271
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,528
None of my grandchildren

272
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:03,497
had ever disliked one
of my stories before.

273
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:06,100
From then on,
he was my favorite.

274
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,068
Well, I don't like that
story, Great Grandpa.

275
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:09,486
(crackling)

276
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:12,122
Future old people
are wizards.

277
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,858
(slurred):
Okay, so here's the game:

278
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,226
I'm... I'm drunk,

279
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:18,629
and I'm gonna throw the football
too hard at my kids.

280
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:20,147
Oh, Dad, do we have to--
Ow!

281
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:22,182
Don't cry!
Don't cry!

282
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:23,734
Game's over if you cry.

283
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:26,637
I want you to learn
about life, Chris,

284
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:28,973
'cause of, in life
it's like this.

285
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,476
Peter, I think you may
have had one too many.

286
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,378
Maybe it's time
to ease off, huh?

287
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:35,713
What are you talking
about, Lois?

288
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,381
Dads getting drunk
on Thanksgiving

289
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:38,816
is a holiday tradition.

290
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:41,952
(slurring): I work hard to put
a cornucopia on this table,

291
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,054
and you're out
showing your lower ankle

292
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:47,308
to every Tom, Tom, and
other Tom in our village!

293
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,326
Don't talk to mother
in like fashion!

294
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:51,645
That's it.
The belt is coming off.

295
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:56,834
All right, son.

296
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:59,003
Let's put these bozos
in a hurt locker.

297
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,071
Right? 'Cause, uh,
"hurt locker" means

298
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,840
some kind of war hero
thing, or something.

299
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:04,575
Pfft. My friends
and I used to laugh

300
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:06,010
about how fake
that movie is.

301
00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:07,011
But...

302
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:08,429
Well, wait, I, uh...

303
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,564
I'm pretty sure
that movie came out

304
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:12,333
after you went
into your coma.

305
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,768
Right-- no, no, uh, I-I-I was
talking about a different movie.

306
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:15,819
Let's play ball!

307
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:18,956
Yeah, let's play ball.

308
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:20,774
(ball pinging off someone's
skin, howls of pain)

309
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:22,676
PETER (slurred):
The world has changed around me,

310
00:10:22,744 --> 00:10:24,244
and I'm mad and scared!

311
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,085
Lois, this pumpkin pie
looks delightful.

312
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,070
Hey, Kevin, can I see
your Purple Heart?

313
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:34,571
'Cause I never
actually seen one.

314
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,241
One-one time this homeless guy
showed me his purple head,

315
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,576
but looking back,
I'm-I'm not so sure

316
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:41,078
that that was really
a military thing.

317
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:42,880
Pfft. I didn't want
that stupid medal.

318
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:44,214
You know what I
did with it?

319
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:45,883
I threw it back over
the White House fence.

320
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,384
Wait a minute.
I thought you said

321
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:48,986
you flew straight
home from Kuwait

322
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:50,621
after you woke
from your coma.

323
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:53,390
When did you throw your medal
over the White House fence?

324
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,226
N-N-N-No, I-I-I told you, I flew
to D.C., ditched the medals,

325
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:57,494
and flew home.

326
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:59,697
I guess that was just
his dirty hobo penis, huh?

327
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:01,465
Kevin, why would you
want to get rid of

328
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:02,633
your war medals
like that?

329
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:04,335
'Cause it was
a stupid war, you know?

330
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:07,421
All it did was put me in a coma
and kill one of my bunkmates

331
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:09,189
and cripple the other one
for life.

332
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:10,591
W-Wait a minute.

333
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:11,959
Now, I thought
earlier you said

334
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:13,661
that both of your
bunkmates were killed.

335
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:16,130
Now you're saying
only one of them was?

336
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,665
But I just want
you guys to know

337
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:19,566
I barely even stared
at that penis for an hour.

338
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:21,035
What? Come on, Dad.

339
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:22,336
Whatev.

340
00:11:22,404 --> 00:11:23,771
H-Hey, why's it
so hot in here?

341
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:24,955
It's too hot in here.

342
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:25,990
Wait a minute.

343
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:27,541
An Ed Hardy T-shirt?

344
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:29,777
That particular
strain of douche bag

345
00:11:29,844 --> 00:11:31,812
didn't arise
until 2007,

346
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,681
while you were
supposedly in your coma.

347
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:34,999
Look, get off my case, Dad!

348
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,400
What do you want from me?

349
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:37,368
The truth.

350
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:38,969
Fine! Here's the truth!

351
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:40,804
I was never in any coma, okay?

352
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:41,805
I bailed.

353
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:43,607
I faked my death and went AWOL.

354
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:44,375
(all gasp)

355
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,110
I faked my own death once.

356
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:52,666
(sobbing)

357
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:58,806
(dirt crunching)

358
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,343
(chuckles)

359
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:06,063
No dentist appointment
for this guy.

360
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:07,264
So, there it is.

361
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:08,432
I'm not a war hero.

362
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,600
I abandoned my platoon.

363
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:10,968
So now what do we do?

364
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,737
Me?

365
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:15,773
Am-Am I, am I supposed
to say something?

366
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,491
Kevin,

367
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,526
you're under arrest for
the crime of desertion.

368
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:20,978
Oh, my.

369
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:23,647
Um, maybe it's time for us
girls to hit the powder room.

370
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:24,681
You may use
the yard.

371
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:34,187
So you were lying
to us this whole time?

372
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,888
You weren't really
injured in Iraq?

373
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,925
First Pat Tillman lies
about how he died and now you?

374
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,693
Kevin, I don't
understand.

375
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,061
There's nothing to understand.

376
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,663
Our son is a deserter.

377
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,381
Come on, Kevin,
I'm taking you to jail.

378
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,033
Joe, wait!
Not now, Bonnie.

379
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,267
Joe, you can't!

380
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,535
Bonnie, we'll discuss
this later!

381
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,371
Joe! You're not taking
my son anywhere.

382
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,307
Damn it, you guys
are ruining Thanksgiving!

383
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,108
And it's my second
favorite holiday,

384
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,878
right after Pretend Not
To Notice People's Race Day.

385
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,046
Hey, you seen
Reggie around?

386
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,714
Which one is Reggie?

387
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,550
Oh, uh, today he's
wearing yellow pants,

388
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:08,387
uh, yellow shirt, yellow
hat, yellow shoes.

389
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,290
Uh, he's got a gold tooth,
uh, diamond earring.

390
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,327
Um, he's got that big necklace
with the dollar sign on it.

391
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,562
Uh, he's always
grabbing his crotch

392
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,763
when he's
telling a story.

393
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:18,998
Like the one about
when he found out

394
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,533
his mother is really
his grandmother.

395
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,001
Could you be more specific?

396
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:23,469
Uh, oh, let's see.

397
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,671
Uh, he always wears
cheap cologne.

398
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,941
Uh, drives a Mercury Cougar
with a crown on the dashboard.

399
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,910
Uh, never pays
his alimony.

400
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,713
Uh, he's extremely cut for
a guy who never works out.

401
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,131
Oh, there he is.
Thanks anyway.

402
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,215
Hey, Reggie!

403
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:39,151
Look, maybe we should
just let Kevin

404
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,970
explain why he did what he did.

405
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:43,205
(sighs)

406
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:44,857
At first,
I believed in the cause.

407
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,259
But then I saw what we were
doing to the people of Iraq.

408
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:48,427
Innocent people.

409
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,613
There was one
that I'll never forget.

410
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,782
<i>He was a little</i>
<i>Iraqi street kid.</i>

411
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,767
<i>I'd befriended him</i>
<i>a few months earlier.</i>

412
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:56,619
<i>Couldn't have been</i>
<i>more than 12 years old.</i>

413
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,804
<i>I taught him how to crack wise,</i>
<i>American style.</i>

414
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:02,658
(people screaming)

415
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:05,211
I guess that store's
having a fire sale.

416
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,946
(laughs)

417
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,382
<i>I tell you, that kid was</i>
<i>strong-headed for his age.</i>

418
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,883
<i>Smart, but innocent.</i>

419
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,302
<i>And then one day,</i>
<i>there was a fire fight.</i>

420
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,748
<i>We bring in this civilian who</i>
<i>got killed in the crossfire.</i>

421
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,935
<i>I pull back the sheet,</i>
<i>and who is it?</i>

422
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,487
<i>Not the kid, but, like,</i>

423
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,139
<i>the kid's dad's, like,</i>
<i>coworker's neighbor.</i>

424
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:37,109
<i>He was 74 and he had actually</i>
<i>tried to rape someone.</i>

425
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,245
<i>But just looking down</i>
<i>at his dead face</i>

426
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,031
<i>and knowing that he lived near</i>
<i>someone who worked with the dad</i>

427
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,568
<i>of the kid whose name I never</i>
<i>found out, I lost all hope.</i>

428
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,953
<i>That's when I knew</i>
<i>I had to get out of Iraq.</i>

429
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:49,872
<i>I just had to wait</i>
<i>for my chance.</i>

430
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:50,873
I call the white meat!

431
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,241
I call the dark meat!

432
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,793
I call the cell phone
duct taped to the side!

433
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:54,710
No!

434
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:01,434
<i>Somehow, I'd been spared</i>
<i>that Thanksgiving.</i>

435
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,886
<i>But I can't say the same</i>
<i>for my bunkmates.</i>

436
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,888
<i>There were bits and pieces</i>
<i>of them everywhere.</i>

437
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,841
<i>I knew the Army would never be</i>
<i>able to identify who was who.</i>

438
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:12,111
<i>So that was my chance</i>
<i>to disappear.</i>

439
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,346
So I left.

440
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,680
How could you
do that?!

441
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:15,898
Coward!
Traitor!

442
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:17,867
If you think
that I'm gonna masturbate

443
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:20,236
after this tonight,
you're right.

444
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,138
We don't have to sit
here and listen to this.

445
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:23,906
Come on, Kevin, let's
get out of here.

446
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,541
Nice try, skank.
Worth a shot.

447
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,827
Well, where did you go
after you left the war?

448
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:29,712
I spent a few years laying low.

449
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,447
Wrote some poems.
You want to hear some?

450
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:32,348
No.
Are you sure?

451
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,783
They're pretty intense.

452
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,551
ALL: No.
Here, let me just read one.

453
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:37,953
If I can guess a line in there,
will you not read it?

454
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,722
I don't think you'll be able
to guess a line.

455
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,692
Is it something like,
"Ice burns as hot as fire"?

456
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,929
Okay, so then I went to Europe,
Australia, Canada, all over.

457
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:48,814
But I really missed you guys.

458
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,617
I wanted to be with people
who love me, no matter what.

459
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:52,952
So I came home.

460
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,353
Well, it sounds
to me like

461
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,822
you're a regular
Benedict Arnold Drummond.

462
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,724
W-What's he expecting us
to cut to?

463
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,543
I think he wants maybe--
I don't know--

464
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,877
Gary Coleman
in a Napoleon hat?

465
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:03,095
But we don't have that.

466
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,229
We-We got to come up
with something.

467
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:05,998
Well, we got, uh, we got

468
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,633
"The Cowardly Lion is
Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist."

469
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:08,751
Play it, play it.

470
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:10,286
But he didn't set it up.
Play it!

471
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:12,071
All right, I'm gonna
check her for diseases.

472
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,106
There's just one thing
I want you to do.

473
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,040
What's that?
What's that?

474
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,258
Talk me out of it.

475
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,177
TIN MAN and SCARECROW:
No, no, no, no, no, no.

476
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,446
What the hell
is going on up there?

477
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:22,681
Well, I'm sorry
you all feel the way you do.

478
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,151
But I walked away from
an illegal war of aggression

479
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,920
being fought 6,000 miles away
from our shores.

480
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,955
Better there than here
where all my stuff is.

481
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,942
So, what, you figured you'd just
let 'em get away with 9/11?

482
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,528
Mr. Griffin, Iraq had
nothing to do with 9/11.

483
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,431
And the war we started in Iraq
has killed a half a million

484
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,434
of their people, which
is like 200 9/11's.

485
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,936
So, I guess those moments
of silence we had

486
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,738
at those sporting events
meant nothing to you.

487
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,523
I'm just saying
this war is wrong.

488
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:51,377
Son, your job isn't to decide
whether it's right or wrong.

489
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,379
Your job is to
follow orders.

490
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,181
Well, that's what the Nazi
soldiers did, isn't it?

491
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,515
They followed orders.

492
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,384
You're saying our troops
are like the Nazis?!

493
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,637
No, I'm just saying that blindly
following orders has resulted

494
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,056
in the deaths of millions
of people throughout history.

495
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,425
You know, I have not talked
to Carol all night.

496
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,960
Carol, how are you?

497
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,496
Look, I think you guys are
all rushing to judge Kevin

498
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,199
without knowing what it was like
to be in his shoes.

499
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,168
He saw horrific things,
in a horrific war,

500
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,237
that only one other person here

501
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,073
could possibly come close
to understanding: Ida.

502
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,308
She was in the military.

503
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,843
She's seen battle.

504
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,545
She's seen innocent people
butchered by war machines.

505
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,081
And I'm sure that Ida,
more than anyone else here,

506
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:32,151
can understand and support
the choice that Kevin made.

507
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,454
No, Brian, I do not understand
Kevin's choice,

508
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,189
and I do not support it.

509
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,041
Okay, well, that's just
some dumb drag queen.

510
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:41,677
Son, when you go to war,
you don't end up

511
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:44,914
fighting for your country
or your family or your flag.

512
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,549
You're fighting for
your fellow soldiers

513
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:48,617
there in the foxhole with you.

514
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:52,404
You walked out on those men, and
that's what's most unforgivable.

515
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,206
You know what, everyone?
Forget it.

516
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,008
Up till today,
you guys thought I was dead.

517
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,042
Well, I'm not.

518
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,344
But after all this,

519
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,095
Dad, you may as well
take me to prison,

520
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,997
'cause right now
I wish I was dead.

521
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:05,301
If anyone has wanted whip cream
on their pie, it's not my fault.

522
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:07,736
I can't get a (bleep) word
in edgewise around here.

523
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,772
Kevin, I don't want
to lose you again.

524
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,540
But I do have
a job to do.

525
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:13,008
So get moving.

526
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:15,294
'Cause there's at least
one Swanson man in this room

527
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,412
who does his duty.

528
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,580
Doodie means poop.
It does.

529
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:18,714
Are you, Dad?

530
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:20,649
Are you the only one
who does his duty?

531
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:22,184
That's not
how I remember it.

532
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:23,219
What are you
talking about?

533
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:24,637
You don't remember, do you?

534
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,472
I was in first grade.

535
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,691
<i>You took me out with you</i>
<i>on one of yo shifts.</i>

536
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:30,559
I just think it's
presumptuous.

537
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:32,595
I mean, come on, "the
country's best yogurt"?

538
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:33,929
You know, prove it.

539
00:18:33,997 --> 00:18:35,297
Show me your data.

540
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,332
MAN:
Help! Police!

541
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:38,217
That man's a thief!

542
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,387
Go get him, Dad!

543
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,699
Reach for the sky, dirtbag!

544
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,170
What the hell?

545
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,388
I'm sorry, Officer.

546
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,257
I-I was just trying
to feed my family.

547
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:03,859
I don't care what you were
trying to do, you broke the law.

548
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:04,877
I know.

549
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,512
I didn't know what else to do.

550
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,847
I have three very wide-eyed
children to feed.

551
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:13,569
Wide-eyed children
are the hungriest.

552
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:16,939
Kids, Daddy has to go away
for a while, okay?

553
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:18,707
Take care of Mommy
until she dies tomorrow.

554
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,109
It's okay, Daddy.

555
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:21,944
I'll be the man of the shack
while you're gone.

556
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:23,879
(coughing)

557
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,368
Uh, listen,
there's been a mistake.

558
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:31,337
I'm not here
to arrest your father.

559
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,137
You're not?

560
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,606
No, Son.

561
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,442
I just came over to tell you
what a great guy your father is

562
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,744
and how hard he's been
working for all of you.

563
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:40,379
Wait. You're letting me go?

564
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,880
I don't understand.

565
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,983
I'm not sure I do either.

566
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,552
I know the law says
I have to arrest you.

567
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,254
But sometimes the law
is just a piece of paper.

568
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:51,223
There's right, there's wrong,

569
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,243
and somewhere in between,
there's life.

570
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:56,145
You folks have a good day.

571
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:00,482
I never forgot what you did.

572
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,185
Well, thanks for
coming, you guys.

573
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:05,220
You know what you were
doing that day, Dad?

574
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,689
You were breaking the law.

575
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:09,642
You knew what your duty told you
you were supposed to do,

576
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,444
but instead, you did
what you thought was right.

577
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:15,648
I haven't thought about
that family in years.

578
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,249
I think about them
all the time.

579
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,551
And the example
you set for me that day.

580
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,453
It's the very reason
I left Iraq.

581
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,722
It sucks how early
I have to work.

582
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,857
(sighs)

583
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,959
Well, Kevin,
I still can't say

584
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:29,128
that I agree
with your choice.

585
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,729
Not one bit.

586
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,264
But I suppose
sometimes a man

587
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,066
has to do
what he thinks is right.

588
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:36,168
And if that's what
you thought was right,

589
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,836
I guess I can accept it.

590
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,506
I'm glad you're
home, son.

591
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,940
Me, too, Dad.

592
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,795
You know, there's still
some pumpkin pie left, everyone.

593
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:48,063
That sounds
good to me.

594
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:49,198
Me, too.

595
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,817
Hey, happy Thanksgiving
to us all, huh?

596
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:54,303
(excited chattering)

597
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:56,321
USA! USA!

598
00:20:56,373 --> 00:20:57,289
MAN:
Wait!

599
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,791
That man's an imposter.

600
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,693
I'm the real Kevin Swanson!

601
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,161
Guys, I don't think
we have time for this.
