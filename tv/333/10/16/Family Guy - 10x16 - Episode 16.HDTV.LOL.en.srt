Good evening, Quahog.
I'm Tom Tucker.

12
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:39,074
Our top story tonight:

13
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:40,608
In a shocking turn of events,

14
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:43,011
the city of Detroit
has officially given up.

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,680
The now former mayor has given
the key to the city

16
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:47,315
back to the Huron Indian tribe.

17
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:49,050
So, farewell, Detroit.

18
00:00:49,118 --> 00:00:52,821
From Bob Seger to Axel Foley,
we never really cared. Joyce?

19
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:54,456
Thanks, Tom.
In local news,

20
00:00:54,523 --> 00:00:57,125
Quahog is expecting
a special guest this weekend,

21
00:00:57,193 --> 00:00:58,860
famed Asian
competitive eating champion

22
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,862
Charles Yamamoto.

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,398
Yamamoto has not yet lost
a hot dog eating competition

24
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:04,766
on his world tour.

25
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:06,935
But if you think
you have what it takes

26
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:08,803
to beat the best eater
in the world,

27
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:11,272
come down to the James Woods
High parking lot this Saturday

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,308
with $50 and a large appetite.

29
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,610
Wow, maybe you should
enter the contest, Dad.

30
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:17,212
I'll bet
you could win.

31
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,480
Well, I would, Chris,

32
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:20,281
if I wasn't so
obsessed with my figure.

33
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:21,599
Wait a minute.

34
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,001
Chris, have <i>you</i> ever
eaten anything?

35
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:24,686
Only, like, all the time!

36
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:26,971
Perfect! Now we just
need the 50 bucks.

37
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,624
Damn it, I knew I shouldn't
have named that star for Mort.

38
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:32,310
Ugh! Just give me the money.

39
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:33,561
Peter, we're not
spending $50

40
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,513
so Chris can stuff his
face with hot dogs.

41
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,815
All right, fine.

42
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:39,033
I'll figure out a way
to get the cash myself.

43
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,185
I'm a smart guy.

44
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:41,753
Peter, no, you're not.

45
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:44,656
Don't you feel ridiculous now?

46
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:49,577
All right, Chris,
if we're gonna pay the entry fee

47
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:50,812
for that eating contest,

48
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,881
we got to sell some
of my old stuff.

49
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:54,382
What are these, Dad?
Oh, wow.

50
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:56,067
I haven't seen
those in a while.

51
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:58,119
Those are my old <i>Playboys</i>
from the '70s.

52
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:00,255
Oh, my God, this one's so hot.

53
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:02,657
You can almost see
a little bit of woman.

54
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:05,977
Wow, Peter, you've got some
pretty cool albums here.

55
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:09,247
Yeah, well, I was one
cool potato back in the day.

56
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:11,416
You know, some of these might
actually be worth something.

57
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:13,401
Look at this--
Beatles, Rolling Stones.

58
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:15,887
Oh, my God, I haven't seen
this one in forever.

59
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:17,839
Look-Look at this. Queen,
<i>News of the World.</i>

60
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:20,141
Check it out.

61
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:21,276
Aah!

62
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:22,544
Oh, what's the matter?

63
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:24,712
What the hell is that?!
A killer robot monster?!

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,147
No, it's <i>News of the World.</i>

65
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:27,748
It's an album
by the band Queen. See?

66
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,434
Aah!
Stewie, relax.

67
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:31,753
No, Brian! You keep
that thing away from me!

68
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,922
Is it... Is it looking at me?!

69
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:35,757
Can it see me?!

70
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,759
(laughing): Man, you're really scared
of this thing, huh?

71
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,194
Does it eat little boys?!

72
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:41,362
I don't know. Maybe,
if it's hungry.

73
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,731
(yelling)

74
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:48,236
Here's 50 bucks.
I'm taking this album.

75
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:49,754
Oh, wow, check
it out, Chris!

76
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:51,890
We got our entry fee
for the eating contest!

77
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:53,408
Now for the
next five days,

78
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,026
we're gonna focus on
nothing but training.

79
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:56,928
We'll even get up at
the crack of dawn.

80
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:00,632
(snoring)

81
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,734
(whispering):
Dad?

82
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,270
Dad, it's time to get up.

83
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:08,723
Oh, jeez, Chris,
it's the crack of dawn.

84
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,059
Yeah, but Dad, you
said to wake you up.

85
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,760
Yeah... Yeah, but, uh...

86
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:14,028
(mumbling)

87
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:15,346
Just... get-get...
get in...

88
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,615
get in the bed
with me and your mom.

89
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:19,417
Okay, but what
about training?

90
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,552
Oh, you smell
like melted cheese.

91
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,722
Yummy, yummy, yummy,
yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

92
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:31,896
(yawns) Good morning, Rupert.

93
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:35,266
Please tell me you set the timer
on the coffeemaker

94
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,085
because I completely forgot.

95
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:38,336
(yelling)

96
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,871
(laughing)

97
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:41,372
You son of a bitch!

98
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,925
Good morning.
Thought I'd help you wake up.

99
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:45,994
God, why does he look sad?!

100
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,428
He's already
destroyed mankind!

101
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:49,063
What else could he want?!

102
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,417
Hey, Carl.

103
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:54,769
Hey, can I get a couple
of scratch-off lottery tickets?

104
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:56,354
Oh, sure, Brian.

105
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:58,773
Ooh, Brian, can I do one?
I love scratchers!

106
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:00,258
Well, all right,
maybe just one.

107
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,194
Cherry.

108
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,379
Another cherry.

109
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,731
Oh, come on, one more, one more!

110
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,834
(yelling)

111
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:11,152
Thanks, Carl.

112
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,487
Yeah, you're welcome.
That was fun.

113
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:14,155
See you later.

114
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:15,396
Hey, uh, thanks
for letting me be Yoda.

115
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,621
Yup.

Oh-ho-ho,
what was I worried about?

127
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:54,061
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Oh, God!

128
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:55,480
Aah! Aah!

129
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,015
He's bleeding, man!

130
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,567
He's bleeding, and nobody's
doing anything about it!

131
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:01,803
I'll tell you what the news
of the world is.

132
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,471
We're in a lot
of (bleep) trouble!

(cheering and applause)

134
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:09,010
All right, Chris,
this is it.

135
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:10,645
This is what we've
been working for.

136
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:12,714
If you get nervous, just
picture the audience naked

137
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:14,515
and slide those hot
dogs down your throat.

138
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,284
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

139
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:19,821
to the World Hot Dog Eating
Championship Competition!

140
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:22,423
Please welcome our undefeated
champion eater,

141
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:24,792
Charles Yamamoto!

142

(cheering and applause)

143
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:31,733
Oh, my God, that guy is huge.

144
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:35,119
All right, eaters,
you have ten minutes.

145
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:38,039
On your marks,
get set, eat!

146
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:51,419
(cheering and whistling)

147
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:59,010
Come on, Chris.
You're doing great.

148
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:00,778
Just keep going.
You're almost there.

149
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:02,797
Well, I'd better get a move on.

150
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:09,904
Time's almost up!

151
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:11,472
It's gonna be a close one!

152
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:15,910
Chris, you're four
hot dogs behind!

153
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,078
Come on! Hurry!

154
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:20,281
Oh! I can't eat anymore.

155
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:22,250
Remember what I told you.

156
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:25,953
I get these weird cyst things
right on the fringe of my sac.

157
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:27,622
I want to get 'em checked,

158
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,657
but I'm afraid
of what they're gonna tell me.

159
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:31,659
He's right. I <i>can</i> do it!

160
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:40,318
(buzzer sounds, cheering)

161
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:41,786
ANNOUNCER:
We have a winner!

162
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:45,640
Ladies and gentlemen, Yamamoto
has finally been defeated!

163
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:48,059
(cheering, applause
and whistling)

164
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:50,244
Chris, you did it.
You're a champion!

165
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:52,246
And now you get your
pick of the groupies.

166
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:55,550
They're shiny.

167
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:56,984
Yeah, it's a
pretty warm day.

168
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:02,540
Oh!

169
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:03,825
Hey, hey, hey,
there, champ!

170
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,226
Aw, look at
him, Lois.

171
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:06,594
Relaxing after
his big victory.

172
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:08,196
Peter, he's not relaxing.

173
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:10,064
He's in a great deal of pain.

174
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:12,467
Damn it, don't you
see what you did to him?

175
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:15,069
I told you not to take him
to that eating competition,

176
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:16,587
and you deliberately defied me!

177
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:18,356
All right, what's
this really about?

178
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,491
Peter, Chris is
already overweight.

179
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,528
We need to start taking
responsibility for his health.

180
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:25,963
So I decided to sign him up
for fat camp.

181
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,900
What?! Mom, I don't want
to go to fat camp!

182
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:31,335
I'm sorry, sweetie.
It's for your own good.

183
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:34,305
And trust me, you'll feel
much better about yourself.

184
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:36,891
Everyone's gonna
make fun of me!

185
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,193
Oh, come on, who's
gonna make fun of you?

186
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:41,279
Hey, fatty, I hear
you're going to fat camp.

187
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:42,380
That's where
you belong!

188
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:43,981
Peter, stop it!

189
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,284
And I'd better not see
you at the big dance!

190
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:47,585
Come on, you.

191
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,887
Sorry, Chris.
I-I'm gonna go with him.

192
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,533
Hi. Welcome to
Camp Fresh Start.

193
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,535
Yeah, our son's gross,
so here we are.

194
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:16,853
The name's
Griffin.

195
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:18,088
Ah, yes,
Chris Griffin.

196
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:20,274
We have you staying
in the Broccoli Cabin.

197
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:22,442
So you guys are just
gonna leave me here?

198
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,344
Yeah, honey.
That's what camp is.

199
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:25,846
I don't want to stay!

200
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:27,664
Please take me home!

201
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:30,033
I don't want to go to fat camp!

202
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:31,735
Aw, come on, Chris.
Your mother's right.

203
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,170
This'll be good for you.

204
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:35,038
Well, how come you
don't have to go?!

205
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,540
You're fatter
than I am!

206
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:38,041
Huh. Good question, Peter.

207
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:39,843
How come
<i>you</i> don't have to go?

208
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:41,044
What are you
talking about?

209
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:42,679
Well, you're the one
who entered him

210
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:44,081
in that hot dog
eating contest.

211
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,449
Besides, he's right.

212
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,618
You <i>could</i> stand to lose
a few pounds yourself.

213
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,553
Unless you don't think
you could handle it.

214
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:51,355
Oh, yeah?

215
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:52,522
Well, I think I can.

216
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,790
What was that?

217
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,392
Never you mind
what that was.

218
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,527
(birds singing)

219
00:08:57,595 --> 00:08:58,996
(trash can lid clanging)

220
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:00,547
Rise and shine, everyone!

221
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:02,916
What do you got there?

222
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,268
A candy bar, huh?

223
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,569
Got any other
contraband?

224
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:06,870
No.
Don't lie to me.

225
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:08,438
My father was a lawyer.

226
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,973
Oh, so your dad
gets guys off.

227
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,241
(laughing)

228
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,342
Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

229
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:14,011
Where's your bag, fatty?

230
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:16,013
You're welcome to
search my "beef case."

231
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,065
But there's
"mutton" in there.

232
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:19,716
(laughs) Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

233
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,585
You're in big trouble, mister.

234
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:24,354
Oh, there's no pulling the
wool over this guy's eyes.

235
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:26,573
Looks like I'd better
go on the "lamb."

236
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:28,425
Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

237
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:34,197
I think I'm gonna do okay here
at fat camp.

238
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:36,400
You sure you got
the "chops" for it?

239
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,151
Knock it off.
I'm the cabin clown.

240
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:40,070
(owl hooting)

241
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:45,842
And then he went
into the kitchen,

242
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,596
slowly opened the refrigerator,
and it was empty!

243
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:50,514
(all gasp)

244
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:51,915
So then, the man,

245
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,850
weak with hunger,
raced from the refrigerator

246
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:56,520
to the counter
to look for a delivery menu,

247
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:59,423
but all he could find was one
for a vegan place!

248
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,241
(all yell)

249
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,026
Vegan places aren't
real, right?

250
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:06,029
No, they're not real.
Or are they?!

251
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:07,197
Aah! Salad!

252
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:09,433
(all yelling)

253
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,934
Thank you
for sharing, Leonard.

254
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:13,436
And I think getting a new couch
<i>was</i> the way to go.

255
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,305
Is there someone else
who has a story

256
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:16,573
they'd like to share? Peter?

257
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:17,841
Uh, yeah, sure.

258
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,910
This one time,
I was on a city bus,

259
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,445
and the guy next to me

260
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:23,246
was eating a bucket
of fried chicken.

261
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:24,981
- Mmm! - Ooh!
Yum!

262
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,317
And the smell was
getting to me, you know.

263
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,519
And even though
I didn't know the guy,

264
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,221
I just dug in

265
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:33,290
and started stuffing
that chicken into my mouth.

266
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:34,424
O-Oh!
Embarrassing.

267
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:35,692
I've done that.

268
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,094
It was so delicious.

269
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:39,730
But... it wasn't
fried chicken.

270
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:41,965
It was a baby!

271
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,701
(crying):
It was a baby.

272
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,219
(sobbing)

273
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:51,942
Stewie?

274
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:54,811
Rupert, we won't give
that evil robot

275
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,446
the satisfaction of killing us.

276
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:59,199
We'll go together
on our own terms.

277
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,284
See you on the other side.

278
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:02,285
(gunshot)

279
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:03,253
Oh, my God!

280
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:04,671
Stewie, no!

281
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:06,073
What the hell's
wrong with you?!

282
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,507
It's that robot!

283
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,776
He killed Queen,
and now he's going to kill me!

284
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:11,078
He didn't kill Queen.

285
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:12,212
They're all fine.

286
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,064
Most of them are fine.

287
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,083
Look, Stewie, I'm sorry
for scaring you, all right?

288
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,218
But come on,
it's not a real robot.

289
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,336
See? It, It's
just an album. Look.

290
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,289
Here, you want
to hit it?

291
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,958
Well... I'm usually more
comfortable around things

292
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,993
if I can put them
in my mouth.

293
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,845
So, can I put it
in my mouth?

294
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,963
I guess.

295
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,033
This is just an album!

296
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,552
Yeah, that's what I've
been trying to tell you.

297
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,421
So, you know,
can you forgive me?

298
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,873
Oh, I suppose so.

299
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,808
I mean, Magellan forgave
the "Land Ho" prankster.

300
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:43,110
Land ho!

301
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,361
Where?! Where?!

302
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:45,762
Psych! Made you
look, loser.

303
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,097
Good thing
there wasn't land

304
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,065
or else you'd have
to meet the natives

305
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,767
with that mustard stain on your shirt.
What stain?

306
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,968
Ah! (blows raspberry)

307
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:54,337
Ugh! Why did I even bring
you on this trip?!

308
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:55,739
Because I'm the best
damn land spotter

309
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:56,940
in all of Europe.

310
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,475
It's true.
You are the best.

311
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,444
Yeah, I don't need you
to tell me that.

312
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,479
(birds chirping)

313
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:04,347
(both panting)

314
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:06,349
Dad, I can't take
this anymore.

315
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:10,387
I'm so tired
and I'm so hungry.

316
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,239
I got an idea, Chris.
Follow me.

317
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:14,891
What are we doing?

318
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,360
I saw a forest like this
in a book one time,

319
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:19,629
and I know there's a gingerbread
house out here somewhere.

320
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,031
Do you think
we could find it?!

321
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:22,983
We have to, Chris.
We-we gotta eat something

322
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,284
besides what
they're feeding us.

323
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,019
I know what
you mean, Dad.

324
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:28,688
I'm so hungry I could
eat this dead camper.

325
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:29,990
Holy crap!

326
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:31,992
(flies buzzing)

327
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:38,465
Well, we clearly don't have
all the evidence yet,

328
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,600
but that's never
stopped us before, right?

329
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:41,902
(laughs)

330
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:46,022
Oh, there's no other cops here.

331
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,025
But we do know one thing,
this kid was murdered.

332
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:50,193
(all gasp)

333
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,528
Murdered?!
Who in the world

334
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:52,762
would want to
kill a camper?

335
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,364
Don't look at me.

336
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:55,949
I'm just here to
drop off my son.

337
00:12:56,033 --> 00:13:00,453
Justin? Justin,
that does not work for me.

338
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,289
And it looks like there
are signs of trauma

339
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:03,790
around the throat.

340
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,759
Somebody strangled
this fat kid.

341
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,160
Wait. He was strangled?

342
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:08,228
Yeah.

343
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,629
Joe, I know
who did it.

344
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:11,164
You do? Who?

345
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:12,916
Well, there's
only one person I know

346
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,634
who likes to strangle fat guys:

347
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,453
Patrick Pewterschmidt.

348
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,254
Who's that?

349
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,556
My brother-in-law.

350
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:22,809
<i>People call him</i>
<i>"The Fat Guy Strangler."</i>

351
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:26,296
<i>He's always had a thing</i>
<i>for strangling fat guys.</i>

352
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,832
I guess he fits
the profile, Peter,

353
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,101
but Lois's brother is
locked up in an asylum.

354
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,303
Well, either way,
we gotta get out of here.

355
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:34,738
Otherwise,
we're just sitting ducks!

356
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:37,574
Hey, we all know this guy
goes for the classy ladies.

357
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,175
In fact, I once
caught him trying

358
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:40,443
to pick up
a quack whore.

359
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,696
(all laugh)

360
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,014
All right, calm down.

361
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,016
We all make bad choices.

362
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,219
(phone rings)

363
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,253
Hello?

364
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:51,555
Lois, I hope
you're sitting down.

365
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,756
I got something
to tell ya.

366
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:54,157
Oh, God, what's wrong?

367
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:56,076
Is everything okay?
Is it Chris?

368
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:57,544
No, it's Peter,
your husband.

369
00:13:57,612 --> 00:13:59,179
But I'm calling
with big news.

370
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:00,880
I was Anita in
the camp production

00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:02,315
of <i>West Side Story.</i>

372
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,784
Peter, you know you're terrible
at patter songs.

373
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:06,453
I did okay.

One of the fat kids at camp
got strangled!

380
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,267
(gasps) Oh, my God!

381
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:22,135
Yeah, but don't worry.
It ain't your brother.

382
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:23,570
He's still locked up
in that asylum.

(hushed):
Peter, he's here!

389
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,134
Wait a second, Lois,
I want to go back

390
00:14:38,202 --> 00:14:40,003
to what you said
about my patter singing.

391
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:41,304
Who gives you
the right?!

392
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:42,706
You know I carried

If he even lays

Oh, Peter, thank God!

405
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,442
Patrick Pewterschmidt,
you're under arrest

406
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,445
for the murder of, uh...
(bleep)

407
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,547
I didn't get
the kid's name.

408
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,049
We're supposed to do that.

409
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,567
Lois, you called
the cops?

410
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,371
Patrick, you're my brother and
I love you, but you're not well.

411
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,622
But I'm better now.

412
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,890
I've put my past
behind me.

413
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,224
Save it, Patrick.

414
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:45,027
We know you escaped
from the asylum and killed...

415
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,896
Bill, we'll just call him
"Bill" for now.

416
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,564
Escaped?
I-I didn't escape.

417
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:51,200
Just this morning, a very nice
gentleman opened my cell door

418
00:15:51,268 --> 00:15:52,968
and said I was
free to go.

419
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,338
Yeah, nice try.
That's not how it works.

420
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:58,441
Uncle Patrick, why do you
strangle fat people?

421
00:15:58,508 --> 00:15:59,809
It's probably
a weird fetish thing.

422
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,377
Some criminals have 'em.

423
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:03,112
Like those anal-retentive
bandits

424
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,780
who robbed Quahog Bank
last year.

425
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:07,283
All right, hands in the air!
Vertically!

426
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:09,185
Both arms should be
parallel to each other!

427
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,737
You, fill this bag with clean,
unmarked bills!

428
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:14,724
But first fix that notepad
so it's at a right angle

429
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,192
with the corner of your desk!

430
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,411
And tap that pile of receipts
against a flat surface

431
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:19,862
so they're not sticking out
haphazardly!

432
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,230
You know what?!
Forget about the money!

433
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,365
Everybody grab a broom!

434
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:23,566
We are straightening
this place up!

435
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,220
All right, campers,

436
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,889
until the Fat Guy Strangler
is caught,

437
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,291
everyone has to stay
inside their cabins.

438
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,893
Now I'm gonna do
a stomach count.

439
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,661
When I call your name,
please respond.

440
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:36,695
Jenkins?

441
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:37,663
(stomach growls)

442
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:38,697
Robertson?

443
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:39,665
(stomach growls)

444
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,733
Davis?

445
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,568
(stomach growls)
Elliot?

446
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:43,469
Where's Elliot?

447
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:44,937
I think he's asleep.

448
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,473
Elliot?
Elliot, wake up.

449
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,959
Elliot? (gasps)

450
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,460
(phone rings)

451
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:52,862
Officer Swanson here.

452
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,764
What?! Oh, my God!

453
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,499
What is it, Joe?

454
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,601
Another camper was strangled
half an hour ago.

455
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:00,870
But... that means...

456
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,038
Patrick can't be
the killer.

457
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,007
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

458
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,642
Acknowledged. I'm on it.

459
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,411
Joe, would you settle
a camp argument?

460
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,379
Is it "Bombardment"
or "Dodgeball"?

461
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,147
Dodgeball.

462
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:12,248
Ah, you don't know.

463
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:13,949
Well, I'd better
put out an APB

464
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:15,484
to all
the neighboring towns.

465
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:17,353
Oh, the murderer won't leave
the camp.

466
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,321
What?
What are you talking about?

467
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:20,756
He's "feeding."

468
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,892
He killed twice and
he's gonna do it again.

469
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,511
He's got plenty of places
to hide out there

470
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:27,062
and a fully stocked corral
of victims.

471
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,514
How do you know that?

472
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,399
Trust me. I know.

473
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,585
You know, Joe, maybe Patrick can
actually be of help.

474
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,037
I mean, who better to get
inside the mind of someone

475
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,373
who's strangling fat people
than someone who's done it himself?

476
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:38,707
Yeah, give him a chance, Joe.

477
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,543
Like I did with scary teenagers.

478
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,878
I used to be afraid of 'em,
until I realized

479
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:44,213
they were just misunderstood.

480
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:46,115
Hey, fat ass,
give me your wallet!

481
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,416
I <i>could</i> give you
my wallet,

482
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,852
but what I think
you really want...

483
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,187
is love.

484
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:52,855
(voice breaks):
It's true!

485
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,478
I'm taking your shoes.

486
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,536
Poor kid.

487
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:08,938
You know,
the weirdest thing is

488
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,556
his bunk is right next
to Chris's.

489
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:11,957
Yeah, that was
a close call.

490
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,993
Oh, it was more
than a close call.

491
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,662
You said the first victim was
wearing a baseball cap,

492
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,197
this second one is blond...

493
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,399
The killer wasn't trying
to murder <i>this</i> kid.

494
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,401
He was trying to murder Chris.

495
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,936
(gasps) Oh, my God!

496
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,188
W-Why would anyone
want to kill Chris?

497
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,640
I don't know,
but I do know

498
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,842
that he's in a great deal
of danger right now.

499
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,393
Come on. Let's go!
Yeah!

500
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:34,230
But wait, this is our last
chance to do a panty raid!

501
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:35,548
(women scream)

502
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:37,249
Yay! Fat camp!
We got it!

503
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:39,201
Oh, no, a gust of wind!

504
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,526
(rustling)

505
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:54,483
(creaking)

506
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,687
(gasps) Wha, what
are you doing here?

507
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:00,589
You dishonored me,
Chris Griffin.

508
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:03,242
No one has ever eaten
more hot dogs than me.

509
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,060
Now you must die!

510
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,949
(gagging)
(glass shattering)

511
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,254
(groans)

512
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:17,239
(gasps)

513
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:24,046
(gagging)

514
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,756
STEWIE: Hey, fat ass!

515
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,826
I got news for you.

516
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:40,996
The <i>News of the World!</i>

517
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:42,231
(screams)

518
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,233
Why does robot hold
dead people?!

519
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:45,951
Is that future or past?!

520
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:47,903
(gasping and groaning)

521
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,877
Oh, my God, Stewie,
you saved my life!

522
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,862
Ah, you would've done
the same for me, Chris.

523
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,198
The important thing is,
we're all gonna be okay.

524
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,549
Right, Giant Robot?

525
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,863
Charles Yamamoto...
went from eating champion

526
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:16,265
to cold-blooded killer.

527
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,499
Who'd have thought?

528
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,401
Wait a minute, Joe.
That's the guy who opened

529
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,303
the door to my cell
yesterday and told me

530
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:22,438
I could leave
the asylum.

531
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:24,106
Huh. Is that right?

532
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,674
Well, then it
all makes sense.

533
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:26,942
Yamamoto wanted it
to look like

534
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,911
you broke out
on your own.

535
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,346
That way,
when he murdered Chris,

536
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:33,115
it was a cinch that you would
take the blame.

537
00:20:33,183 --> 00:20:37,052
Well, Patrick, I guess
we all owe you an apology.

538
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,087
Patrick?

539
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,022
Where did he go?

540
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,390
He was just
right here.

541
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,424
What happened?!

542
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,661
Damn it!
He must've gotten away!

543
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:46,929
How is that possible?!

544
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,797
I don't know,
but I'd better make it

545
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,399
look like there
was a struggle.

546
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:51,667
Someone punch me
in the face.

547
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,453
I'm a good friend
to you.
