Good evening, Quahog.
I'm Tom Tucker.

13
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,583
Our top story tonight:

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,117
In a shocking turn of events,

15
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:42,520
the city of Detroit
has officially given up.

16
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:45,189
The now former mayor has given
the key to the city

17
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:46,824
back to the Huron Indian tribe.

18
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:48,559
So, farewell, Detroit.

19
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:52,330
From Bob Seger to Axel Foley,
we never really cared. Joyce?

20
00:00:52,397 --> 00:00:53,965
Thanks, Tom.
In local news,

21
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,634
Quahog is expecting
a special guest this weekend,

22
00:00:56,702 --> 00:00:58,369
famed Asian
competitive eating champion

23
00:00:58,437 --> 00:01:00,371
Charles Yamamoto.

24
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,907
Yamamoto has not yet lost
a hot dog eating competition

25
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:04,275
on his world tour.

26
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:06,444
But if you think
you have what it takes

27
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:08,312
to beat the best eater
in the world,

28
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,781
come down to the James Woods
High parking lot this Saturday

29
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:12,817
with $50 and a large appetite.

30
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:15,119
Wow, maybe you should
enter the contest, Dad.

31
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:16,721
I'll bet
you could win.

32
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:17,989
Well, I would, Chris,

33
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:19,790
if I wasn't so
obsessed with my figure.

34
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:21,108
Wait a minute.

35
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:22,510
Chris, have <i>you</i> ever
eaten anything?

36
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,195
Only, like, all the time!

37
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:26,480
Perfect! Now we just
need the 50 bucks.

38
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:29,133
Damn it, I knew I shouldn't
have named that star for Mort.

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,819
Ugh! Just give me the money.

40
00:01:31,887 --> 00:01:33,070
Peter, we're not
spending $50

41
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:35,022
so Chris can stuff his
face with hot dogs.

42
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,324
All right, fine.

43
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,542
I'll figure out a way
to get the cash myself.

44
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,694
I'm a smart guy.

45
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:41,262
Peter, no, you're not.

46
00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:44,165
Don't you feel ridiculous now?

47
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:49,086
All right, Chris,
if we're gonna pay the entry fee

48
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:50,321
for that eating contest,

49
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,390
we got to sell some
of my old stuff.

50
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:53,891
What are these, Dad?
Oh, wow.

51
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:55,576
I haven't seen
those in a while.

52
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:57,628
Those are my old <i>Playboys</i>
from the '70s.

53
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:59,764
Oh, my God, this one's so hot.

54
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:02,166
You can almost see
a little bit of woman.

55
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:05,486
Wow, Peter, you've got some
pretty cool albums here.

56
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:08,756
Yeah, well, I was one
cool potato back in the day.

57
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,925
You know, some of these might
actually be worth something.

58
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:12,910
Look at this--
Beatles, Rolling Stones.

59
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:15,396
Oh, my God, I haven't seen
this one in forever.

60
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:17,348
Look-Look at this. Queen,
<i>News of the World.</i>

61
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:19,650
Check it out.

62
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:20,785
Aah!

63
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:22,053
Oh, what's the matter?

64
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,221
What the hell is that?!
A killer robot monster?!

65
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:25,656
No, it's <i>News of the World.</i>

66
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:27,257
It's an album
by the band Queen. See?

67
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:28,943
Aah!
Stewie, relax.

68
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:31,262
No, Brian! You keep
that thing away from me!

69
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,431
Is it... Is it looking at me?!

70
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:35,266
Can it see me?!

71
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,268
Man, you're really scared
of this thing, huh?

72
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:38,703
Does it eat little boys?!

73
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,871
I don't know. Maybe,
if it's hungry.

74
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:47,745
Here's 50 bucks.
I'm taking this album.

75
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:49,263
Oh, wow, check
it out, Chris!

76
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:51,399
We got our entry fee
for the eating contest!

77
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:52,917
Now for the
next five days,

78
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:54,535
we're gonna focus on
nothing but training.

79
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:56,437
We'll even get up at
the crack of dawn.

80
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,243
Dad?

81
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,779
Dad, it's time to get up.

82
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:08,232
Oh, jeez, Chris,
it's the crack of dawn.

83
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,568
Yeah, but Dad, you
said to wake you up.

84
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:12,269
Yeah... Yeah, but, uh...

85
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:14,855
Just... get-get...
get in...

86
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,124
get in the bed
with me and your mom.

87
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:18,926
Okay, but what
about training?

88
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:21,061
Oh, you smell
like melted cheese.

89
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,231
Yummy, yummy, yummy,
yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

90
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:31,405
Good morning, Rupert.

91
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:34,775
Please tell me you set the timer
on the coffeemaker

92
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:36,594
because I completely forgot.

93
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:40,881
You son of a bitch!

94
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:43,434
Good morning.
Thought I'd help you wake up.

95
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:45,503
God, why does he look sad?!

96
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,937
He's already
destroyed mankind!

97
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:48,572
What else could he want?!

98
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:51,926
Hey, Carl.

99
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:54,278
Hey, can I get a couple
of scratch-off lottery tickets?

100
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:55,863
Oh, sure, Brian.

101
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:58,282
Ooh, Brian, can I do one?
I love scratchers!

102
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,767
Well, all right,
maybe just one.

103
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,703
Cherry.

104
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:03,888
Another cherry.

105
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:06,240
Oh, come on, one more, one more!

106
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:10,661
Thanks, Carl.

107
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:11,996
Yeah, you're welcome.
That was fun.

108
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:13,664
See you later.

109
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:14,905
Hey, uh, thanks
for letting me be Yoda.

110
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,130
Yup.

111
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:23,424
What is this?

112
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:33,734
("Pop Goes the Weasel" plays)

113
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,752
Oh-ho-ho,
what was I worried about?

114
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,570
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Oh, God!

115
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:54,989
Aah! Aah!

116
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:56,524
He's bleeding, man!

117
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:59,076
He's bleeding, and nobody's
doing anything about it!

118
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:01,312
I'll tell you what the news
of the world is.

119
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:02,980
We're in a lot
of  trouble!

120
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:08,519
All right, Chris,
this is it.

121
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:10,154
This is what we've
been working for.

122
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:12,223
If you get nervous, just
picture the audience naked

123
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,024
and slide those hot
dogs down your throat.

124
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:15,793
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

125
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:19,330
to the World Hot Dog Eating
Championship Competition!

126
00:05:19,397 --> 00:05:21,932
Please welcome our undefeated
champion eater,

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,301
Charles Yamamoto!

128
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:31,242
Oh, my God, that guy is huge.

129
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,628
All right, eaters,
you have ten minutes.

130
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:37,548
On your marks,
get set, eat!

131
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:58,519
Come on, Chris.
You're doing great.

132
00:05:58,603 --> 00:06:00,287
Just keep going.
You're almost there.

133
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:02,306
Well, I'd better get a move on.

134
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:09,413
Time's almost up!

135
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:10,981
It's gonna be a close one!

136
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:15,419
Chris, you're four
hot dogs behind!

137
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:16,587
Come on! Hurry!

138
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:19,790
Oh! I can't eat anymore.

139
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:21,759
Remember what I told you.

140
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:25,462
I get these weird cyst things
right on the fringe of my sac.

141
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,131
I want to get 'em checked,

142
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:29,166
but I'm afraid
of what they're gonna tell me.

143
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,168
He's right. I <i>can</i> do it!

144
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:41,295
We have a winner!

145
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:45,149
Ladies and gentlemen, Yamamoto
has finally been defeated!

146
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:49,753
Chris, you did it.
You're a champion!

147
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,755
And now you get your
pick of the groupies.

148
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:55,059
They're shiny.

149
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,493
Yeah, it's a
pretty warm day.

150
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:02,049
Oh!

151
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:03,334
Hey, hey, hey,
there, champ!

152
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:04,735
Aw, look at
him, Lois.

153
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,103
Relaxing after
his big victory.

154
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:07,705
Peter, he's not relaxing.

155
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,573
He's in a great deal of pain.

156
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,976
Damn it, don't you
see what you did to him?

157
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:14,578
I told you not to take him
to that eating competition,

158
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:16,096
and you deliberately defied me!

159
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:17,865
All right, what's
this really about?

160
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:20,000
Peter, Chris is
already overweight.

161
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:23,037
We need to start taking
responsibility for his health.

162
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:25,472
So I decided to sign him up
for fat camp.

163
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,409
What?! Mom, I don't want
to go to fat camp!

164
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:30,844
I'm sorry, sweetie.
It's for your own good.

165
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:33,814
And trust me, you'll feel
much better about yourself.

166
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:36,400
Everyone's gonna
make fun of me!

167
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:38,702
Oh, come on, who's
gonna make fun of you?

168
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:40,788
Hey, fatty, I hear
you're going to fat camp.

169
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:41,889
That's where
you belong!

170
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:43,490
Peter, stop it!

171
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:45,793
And I'd better not see
you at the big dance!

172
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:47,094
Come on, you.

173
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,396
Sorry, Chris.
I-I'm gonna go with him.

174
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:11,643
Hi. Welcome to
Camp Fresh Start.

175
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:13,645
Yeah, our son's gross,
so here we are.

176
00:08:13,713 --> 00:08:14,963
The name's
Griffin.

177
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:16,198
Ah, yes,
Chris Griffin.

178
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,384
We have you staying
in the Broccoli Cabin.

179
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:20,552
So you guys are just
gonna leave me here?

180
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,454
Yeah, honey.
That's what camp is.

181
00:08:22,522 --> 00:08:23,956
I don't want to stay!

182
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:25,774
Please take me home!

183
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:28,143
I don't want to go to fat camp!

184
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:29,845
Aw, come on, Chris.
Your mother's right.

185
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:31,280
This'll be good for you.

186
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:33,148
Well, how come you
don't have to go?!

187
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:34,650
You're fatter
than I am!

188
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:36,151
Huh. Good question, Peter.

189
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:37,953
How come
<i>you</i> don't have to go?

190
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:39,154
What are you
talking about?

191
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:40,789
Well, you're the one
who entered him

192
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:42,191
in that hot dog
eating contest.

193
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:43,559
Besides, he's right.

194
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:45,728
You <i>could</i> stand to lose
a few pounds yourself.

195
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:47,663
Unless you don't think
you could handle it.

196
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:49,465
Oh, yeah?

197
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:50,632
Well, I think I can.

198
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,900
What was that?

199
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:53,502
Never you mind
what that was.

200
00:08:57,173 --> 00:08:58,657
Rise and shine, everyone!

201
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:01,026
What do you got there?

202
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:02,378
A candy bar, huh?

203
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:03,679
Got any other
contraband?

204
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:04,980
No.
Don't lie to me.

205
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:06,548
My father was a lawyer.

206
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:08,083
Oh, so your dad
gets guys off.

207
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:10,452
Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

208
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,121
Where's your bag, fatty?

209
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:14,123
You're welcome to
search my "beef case."

210
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,175
But there's
"mutton" in there.

211
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:17,826
Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

212
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:19,695
You're in big trouble, mister.

213
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:22,464
Oh, there's no pulling the
wool over this guy's eyes.

214
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:24,683
Looks like I'd better
go on the "lamb."

215
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,535
Peter Griffin.
Cabin clown.

216
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:32,307
I think I'm gonna do okay here
at fat camp.

217
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,510
You sure you got
the "chops" for it?

218
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:36,261
Knock it off.
I'm the cabin clown.

219
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:43,952
And then he went
into the kitchen,

220
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,706
slowly opened the refrigerator,
and it was empty!

221
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,025
So then, the man,

222
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:51,960
weak with hunger,
raced from the refrigerator

223
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:54,630
to the counter
to look for a delivery menu,

224
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:57,533
but all he could find was one
for a vegan place!

225
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:01,136
Vegan places aren't
real, right?

226
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:04,139
No, they're not real.
Or are they?!

227
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:05,307
Aah! Salad!

228
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,044
Thank you
for sharing, Leonard.

229
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:11,546
And I think getting a new couch
<i>was</i> the way to go.

230
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:13,415
Is there someone else
who has a story

231
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:14,683
they'd like to share? Peter?

232
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:15,951
Uh, yeah, sure.

233
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,020
This one time,
I was on a city bus,

234
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:19,555
and the guy next to me

235
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:21,356
was eating a bucket
of fried chicken.

236
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:23,091
- Mmm! - Ooh!
Yum!

237
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,427
And the smell was
getting to me, you know.

238
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,629
And even though
I didn't know the guy,

239
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:29,331
I just dug in

240
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,400
and started stuffing
that chicken into my mouth.

241
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:32,534
O-Oh!
Embarrassing.

242
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:33,802
I've done that.

243
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,204
It was so delicious.

244
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:37,840
But... it wasn't
fried chicken.

245
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:40,075
It was a baby!

246
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:42,811
It was a baby.

247
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:50,052
Stewie?

248
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,921
Rupert, we won't give
that evil robot

249
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:54,556
the satisfaction of killing us.

250
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:57,309
We'll go together
on our own terms.

251
00:10:57,377 --> 00:10:59,394
See you on the other side.

252
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:01,363
Oh, my God!

253
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:02,781
Stewie, no!

254
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:04,183
What the hell's
wrong with you?!

255
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,617
It's that robot!

256
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:07,886
He killed Queen,
and now he's going to kill me!

257
00:11:07,954 --> 00:11:09,188
He didn't kill Queen.

258
00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:10,322
They're all fine.

259
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,174
Most of them are fine.

260
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:14,193
Look, Stewie, I'm sorry
for scaring you, all right?

261
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,328
But come on,
it's not a real robot.

262
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:18,446
See? It, It's
just an album. Look.

263
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:20,399
Here, you want
to hit it?

264
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:23,068
Well... I'm usually more
comfortable around things

265
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:25,103
if I can put them
in my mouth.

266
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:26,955
So, can I put it
in my mouth?

267
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:28,073
I guess.

268
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,143
This is just an album!

269
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:33,662
Yeah, that's what I've
been trying to tell you.

270
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,531
So, you know,
can you forgive me?

271
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,983
Oh, I suppose so.

272
00:11:38,051 --> 00:11:39,918
I mean, Magellan forgave
the "Land Ho" prankster.

273
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:41,220
Land ho!

274
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:42,471
Where?! Where?!

275
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:43,872
Psych! Made you
look, loser.

276
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,207
Good thing
there wasn't land

277
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,175
or else you'd have
to meet the natives

278
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:48,877
with that mustard stain on your shirt.
What stain?

279
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:50,078
Ah!

280
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:52,447
Ugh! Why did I even bring
you on this trip?!

281
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:53,849
Because I'm the best
damn land spotter

282
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,050
in all of Europe.

283
00:11:55,118 --> 00:11:56,585
It's true.
You are the best.

284
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:58,554
Yeah, I don't need you
to tell me that.

285
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,459
Dad, I can't take
this anymore.

286
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:08,497
I'm so tired
and I'm so hungry.

287
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:10,349
I got an idea, Chris.
Follow me.

288
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:13,001
What are we doing?

289
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:15,470
I saw a forest like this
in a book one time,

290
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:17,739
and I know there's a gingerbread
house out here somewhere.

291
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,141
Do you think
we could find it?!

292
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,093
We have to, Chris.
We-we gotta eat something

293
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,394
besides what
they're feeding us.

294
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:24,129
I know what
you mean, Dad.

295
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:26,798
I'm so hungry I could
eat this dead camper.

296
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,100
Holy crap!

297
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:36,575
Well, we clearly don't have
all the evidence yet,

298
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,710
but that's never
stopped us before, right?

299
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,132
Oh, there's no other cops here.

300
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,135
But we do know one thing,
this kid was murdered.

301
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:49,638
Murdered?!
Who in the world

302
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:50,872
would want to
kill a camper?

303
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,474
Don't look at me.

304
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,059
I'm just here to
drop off my son.

305
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:58,563
Justin? Justin,
that does not work for me.

306
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,399
And it looks like there
are signs of trauma

307
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:01,900
around the throat.

308
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:03,869
Somebody strangled
this fat kid.

309
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:05,270
Wait. He was strangled?

310
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:06,338
Yeah.

311
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:07,739
Joe, I know
who did it.

312
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:09,274
You do? Who?

313
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:11,026
Well, there's
only one person I know

314
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:12,744
who likes to strangle fat guys:

315
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,563
Patrick Pewterschmidt.

316
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:15,364
Who's that?

317
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:17,666
My brother-in-law.

318
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:20,919
<i>People call him</i>
<i>"The Fat Guy Strangler."</i>

319
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:24,406
<i>He's always had a thing</i>
<i>for strangling fat guys.</i>

320
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:26,942
I guess he fits
the profile, Peter,

321
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,211
but Lois's brother is
locked up in an asylum.

322
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,413
Well, either way,
we gotta get out of here.

323
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:32,848
Otherwise,
we're just sitting ducks!

324
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:35,684
Hey, we all know this guy
goes for the classy ladies.

325
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:37,285
In fact, I once
caught him trying

326
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:38,553
to pick up
a quack whore.

327
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,124
All right, calm down.

328
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:44,126
We all make bad choices.

329
00:13:47,397 --> 00:13:48,363
Hello?

330
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:49,665
Lois, I hope
you're sitting down.

331
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:50,866
I got something
to tell ya.

332
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:52,267
Oh, God, what's wrong?

333
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:54,186
Is everything okay?
Is it Chris?

334
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:55,654
No, it's Peter,
your husband.

335
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:57,289
But I'm calling
with big news.

336
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:58,990
I was Anita in
the camp production

337
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:00,425
of <i>West Side Story.</i>

338
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:02,894
Peter, you know you're terrible
at patter songs.

339
00:14:02,962 --> 00:14:04,563
I did okay.

345
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:16,742
One of the fat kids at camp
got strangled!

346
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:18,377
Oh, my God!

347
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:20,245
Yeah, but don't worry.
It ain't your brother.

348
00:14:20,313 --> 00:14:21,680
He's still locked up
in that asylum.

349
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:24,116
Um, Mom...

350
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:25,951
look who dropped
by for a visit.

351
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,221
Hello, Lois.

352
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:30,622
Patrick!

353
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,890
It's been
a long time.

354
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,242
Peter, he's here!

355
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,244
Wait a second, Lois,
I want to go back

356
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:38,113
to what you said
about my patter singing.

357
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:39,414
Who gives you
the right?!

358
00:14:39,482 --> 00:14:40,816
You know I carried
<i>Pirates of Penzance</i>

359
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:43,385

before Patrick hurts
anyone else!

366
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,515
If he even lays
a finger on my family,

367
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,683
I'll do to him
what I did to the Riddler.

368
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,880
Freeze, psycho!

369
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:21,415
Oh, Peter, thank God!

370
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:23,250
Patrick Pewterschmidt,
you're under arrest

371
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:26,253
for the murder of, uh...

372
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:28,355
I didn't get
the kid's name.

373
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:29,857
We're supposed to do that.

374
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:31,375
Lois, you called
the cops?

375
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:35,179
Patrick, you're my brother and
I love you, but you're not well.

376
00:15:35,246 --> 00:15:36,430
But I'm better now.

377
00:15:36,497 --> 00:15:37,698
I've put my past
behind me.

378
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:39,032
Save it, Patrick.

379
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,835
We know you escaped
from the asylum and killed...

380
00:15:41,903 --> 00:15:43,704
Bill, we'll just call him
"Bill" for now.

381
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:45,372
Escaped?
I-I didn't escape.

382
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,008
Just this morning, a very nice
gentleman opened my cell door

383
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:49,776
and said I was
free to go.

384
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:52,146
Yeah, nice try.
That's not how it works.

385
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:55,249
Uncle Patrick, why do you
strangle fat people?

386
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,617
It's probably
a weird fetish thing.

387
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:58,185
Some criminals have 'em.

388
00:15:58,253 --> 00:15:59,920
Like those anal-retentive
bandits

389
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:01,588
who robbed Quahog Bank
last year.

390
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:04,091
All right, hands in the air!
Vertically!

391
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,993
Both arms should be
parallel to each other!

392
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:08,545
You, fill this bag with clean,
unmarked bills!

393
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,532
But first fix that notepad
so it's at a right angle

394
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,000
with the corner of your desk!

395
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:15,219
And tap that pile of receipts
against a flat surface

396
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:16,670
so they're not sticking out
haphazardly!

397
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:18,038
You know what?!
Forget about the money!

398
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:19,173
Everybody grab a broom!

399
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,374
We are straightening
this place up!

400
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:25,028
All right, campers,

401
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:26,697
until the Fat Guy Strangler
is caught,

402
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:29,099
everyone has to stay
inside their cabins.

403
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,701
Now I'm gonna do
a stomach count.

404
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:32,469
When I call your name,
please respond.

405
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:33,503
Jenkins?

406
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:35,505
Robertson?

407
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,541
Davis?

408
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:39,376
Elliot?

409
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:40,277
Where's Elliot?

410
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:41,745
I think he's asleep.

411
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:44,281
Elliot?
Elliot, wake up.

412
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:46,767
Elliot?

413
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:49,670
Officer Swanson here.

414
00:16:49,737 --> 00:16:51,572
What?! Oh, my God!

415
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,307
What is it, Joe?

416
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:55,409
Another camper was strangled
half an hour ago.

417
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:57,678
But... that means...

418
00:16:57,745 --> 00:16:59,846
Patrick can't be
the killer.

419
00:16:59,914 --> 00:17:01,815
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

420
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,450
Acknowledged. I'm on it.

421
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,219
Joe, would you settle
a camp argument?

422
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:07,187
Is it "Bombardment"
or "Dodgeball"?

423
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:07,955
Dodgeball.

424
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:09,056
Ah, you don't know.

425
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:10,757
Well, I'd better
put out an APB

426
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:12,292
to all
the neighboring towns.

427
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,161
Oh, the murderer won't leave
the camp.

428
00:17:14,229 --> 00:17:16,129
What?
What are you talking about?

429
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:17,564
He's "feeding."

430
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:19,700
He killed twice and
he's gonna do it again.

431
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,319
He's got plenty of places
to hide out there

432
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:23,870
and a fully stocked corral
of victims.

433
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:25,322
How do you know that?

434
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,207
Trust me. I know.

435
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:29,393
You know, Joe, maybe Patrick can
actually be of help.

436
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,845
I mean, who better to get
inside the mind of someone

437
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:34,181
who's strangling fat people
than someone who's done it himself?

438
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:35,515
Yeah, give him a chance, Joe.

439
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,351
Like I did with scary teenagers.

440
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:39,686
I used to be afraid of 'em,
until I realized

441
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,021
they were just misunderstood.

442
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:42,923
Hey, fat ass,
give me your wallet!

443
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:44,224
I <i>could</i> give you
my wallet,

444
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:46,660
but what I think
you really want...

445
00:17:46,728 --> 00:17:47,995
is love.

446
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:49,663
It's true!

447
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,286
I'm taking your shoes.

448
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:04,344
Poor kid.

449
00:18:04,412 --> 00:18:05,746
You know,
the weirdest thing is

450
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:07,364
his bunk is right next
to Chris's.

451
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:08,765
Yeah, that was
a close call.

452
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,801
Oh, it was more
than a close call.

453
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:13,470
You said the first victim was
wearing a baseball cap,

454
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:15,005
this second one is blond...

455
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,207
The killer wasn't trying
to murder <i>this</i> kid.

456
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,209
He was trying to murder Chris.

457
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:20,744
Oh, my God!

458
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:22,996
W-Why would anyone
want to kill Chris?

459
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:24,448
I don't know,
but I do know

460
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:26,650
that he's in a great deal
of danger right now.

461
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:28,201
Come on. Let's go!
Yeah!

462
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:31,038
But wait, this is our last
chance to do a panty raid!

463
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,057
Yay! Fat camp!
We got it!

464
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:36,009
Oh, no, a gust of wind!

465
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:55,495
Wha, what
are you doing here?

466
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:57,397
You dishonored me,
Chris Griffin.

467
00:18:57,465 --> 00:19:00,050
No one has ever eaten
more hot dogs than me.

468
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:01,868
Now you must die!

469
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:31,564
Hey, fat ass!

470
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,634
I got news for you.

471
00:19:34,702 --> 00:19:37,804
The <i>News of the World!</i>

472
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:41,041
Why does robot hold
dead people?!

473
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:42,759
Is that future or past?!

474
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:51,685
Oh, my God, Stewie,
you saved my life!

475
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:53,670
Ah, you would've done
the same for me, Chris.

476
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:56,006
The important thing is,
we're all gonna be okay.

477
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:57,357
Right, Giant Robot?

478
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:11,671
Charles Yamamoto...
went from eating champion

479
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:13,073
to cold-blooded killer.

480
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:14,307
Who'd have thought?

481
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,209
Wait a minute, Joe.
That's the guy who opened

482
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,111
the door to my cell
yesterday and told me

483
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,246
I could leave
the asylum.

484
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:20,914
Huh. Is that right?

485
00:20:20,982 --> 00:20:22,482
Well, then it
all makes sense.

486
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,750
Yamamoto wanted it
to look like

487
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:25,719
you broke out
on your own.

488
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:27,154
That way,
when he murdered Chris,

489
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:29,923
it was a cinch that you would
take the blame.

490
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:33,860
Well, Patrick, I guess
we all owe you an apology.

491
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:34,895
Patrick?

492
00:20:34,962 --> 00:20:36,830
Where did he go?

493
00:20:36,898 --> 00:20:38,198
He was just
right here.

494
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,232
What happened?!

495
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:42,469
Damn it!
He must've gotten away!

496
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:43,737
How is that possible?!

497
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:45,605
I don't know,
but I'd better make it

498
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:47,207
look like there
was a struggle.

499
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:48,475
Someone punch me
in the face.

500
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:51,261
I'm a good friend
to you.

501
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:55,286
