他现在可疼的要命呢

Damn it, don't you see what you did to him?

166
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:15,069
我跟你说别带他去参加大胃王比赛
I told you not to take him to that eating competition,

167
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:16,587
可你却故意跟我对着干
and you deliberately defied me!

168
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:18,356
好吧 那你到底想怎样

Peter Chris已经超重了
Peter, Chris is already overweight.

170
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,528
我们得为他的健康负起责任来
We need to start taking responsibility for his health.

171
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:25,963
所以我决定为他报一个减肥训练营

172
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,900

180
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,284

181
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:47,585

193
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:31,735

This'll be good for you.

195
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:35,038
呃 那你为什么不必参加

而且 他说的也对
Besides, he's right.

203
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,618
你自己也好减掉点肥肉了
You could stand to lose a few pounds yourself.

204
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,553
除非你觉得自己做不到
Unless you don't think you could handle it.

205
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:51,355
哦 是吗

Look, Stewie, I'm sorry for scaring you, all right?

278
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,218
可不至于吧 那又不是真的机器人
But come on, it's not a real robot.

279
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,336
看 这 这就是张唱片 你看
See? It, It's just an album. Look.

280
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,289
给 你想打它吗
Here, you want to hit it?

281
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,958
呃…我通常会对那些东西感觉舒服一些
Well... I'm usually more comfortable around things

282
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,993
如果他们能放进我嘴里的话
if I can put them in my mouth.

283
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,845
那么 我能把它放嘴里吗
So, can I put it in my mouth?

284
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,963
可以吧
I guess.

285
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,033
这就是张唱片啊
This is just an album!

286
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,552
是啊 我已经跟你说了
Yeah, that's what I've been trying to tell you.

287
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,421
那你会原谅我吗
So, you know, can you forgive me?

288
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,873
唉 我应该会的
Oh, I suppose so.

289
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,808
我是说 连麦哲伦都原谅了那个"陆地哟"的搞怪家伙
I mean, Magellan forgave the "Land Ho" prankster.

290
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:41,808
第一个发现了地球是圆的

291
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:43,110
陆地哟
Land ho!

292
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,361
在哪儿 在哪儿
Where?! Where?!

293
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:45,762
骗你的 傻了吧 撸瑟
Psych! Made you look, loser.

294
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,097
还好没有陆地
Good thing there wasn't land

295
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,065
不然你就得会见土著人
or else you'd have to meet the natives

296
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,767
- 并穿着这件沾有芥末污渍的上衣了 - 什么污渍
- with that mustard stain on your shirt. - What stain?

297
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,968
啊
Ah!

298
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:54,337
唉 我这趟旅程怎么就带上你了
Ugh! Why did I even bring you on this trip?!

299
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:55,739
因为老子是整个欧洲最好的
Because I'm the best damn land spotter

300
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:56,940
陆地眺望者
in all of Europe.

301
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,475
的确如此 你是最好的
It's true. You are the best.

302
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,444
嗯 我不需要你告诉我这个
Yeah, I don't need you to tell me that.

303
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:06,349
老爸 我再也走不动了
Dad, I can't take this anymore.

304
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:10,387
我又累又饿
I'm so tired and I'm so hungry.

305
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,239
我有个主意 Chris 跟我来
I got an idea, Chris. Follow me.

306
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:14,891
我们要去干嘛
What are we doing?

307
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,360
我曾经在一本书上见过这样的树林
I saw a forest like this in a book one time,

308
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:19,629
我知道在某个地方有一间姜饼屋
and I know there's a gingerbread house out here somewhere.

309
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:19,629
出自格林童话"汉赛尔与格莱特"

310
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,031
你觉得我们能找到它吗
Do you think we could find it?!

311
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:22,983
我们必须找到 Chris 我们-我们得吃点东西
We have to, Chris. We-we gotta eat something

312
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,284
不能光靠他们给我们吃的
besides what they're feeding us.

313
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,019
我明白你的意思 老爸
I know what you mean, Dad.

314
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:28,688
我饿得都能吃下这个死去的训练营员了
I'm so hungry I could eat this dead camper.

315
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:29,990
我靠
Holy crap!

316
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:38,465
好吧 很明显我们还没有收集到所有证据
Well, we clearly don't have all the evidence yet,

317
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,600
不过这从没有难倒过我们 对吗
but that's never stopped us before, right?

318
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:46,022
哦 这儿没有其他警察
Oh, there's no other cops here.

319
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,025
不过我们能确认一件事 这孩子是被谋杀的
But we do know one thing, this kid was murdered.

320
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,528
谋杀 这世上有谁
Murdered?! Who in the world

321
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:52,762
会去谋杀一个训练营员
would want to kill a camper?

322
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,364
别看我啊
Don't look at me.

323
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:55,949
我只是来这放下我儿子的
I'm just here to drop off my son.

324
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:55,949
《黑色星期五》系列中的杀人狂Jason
拥有不死之身 杀露营者出身

325
00:12:56,033 --> 00:13:00,453
贾斯汀 贾斯汀 那么做对我不管用
Justin? Justin, that does not work for me.

326
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,289
而且看起来有外伤的痕迹
And it looks like there are signs of trauma

327
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:03,790
在喉咙附近
around the throat.

328
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,759
有人勒死了这个胖孩子
Somebody strangled this fat kid.

329
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,160
慢着 他是被勒死的
Wait. He was strangled?

330
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:08,228
嗯
Yeah.

331
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,629
Joe 我知道是谁干的了
Joe, I know who did it.

332
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:11,164
你知道 是谁
You do? Who?

333
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:12,916
嗯 我知道只有一个人
Well, there's only one person I know

334
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,634
热衷于勒死胖子：
who likes to strangle fat guys:

335
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,453
Patrick Pewterschmidt.

336
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,254
他是谁
Who's that?

337
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,556
我的大舅子
My brother-in-law.

338
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:22,809
江湖人称"胖子扼杀者"
People call him "The Fat Guy Strangler."

339
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:22,809
出自417 也是那集的片名

340
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:26,296
他一直对勒死胖人情有独钟
He's always had a thing for strangling fat guys.

341
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,832
我看他符合犯罪特征 Peter
I guess he fits the profile, Peter,

342
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,101
可是Lois的哥哥被锁在精神病院啊
but Lois's brother is locked up in an asylum.

343
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,303
好吧 不管怎样 我们得离开这里
Well, either way, we gotta get out of here.

344
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:34,738
不然 我们就成了"坐鸭"
Otherwise, we're just sitting ducks!

345
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:37,574
嗨 我们都知道这家伙想泡靓妹
Hey, we all know this guy goes for the classy ladies.

346
00:13:37,574 --> 00:13:37,574
恶搞了喜剧中心的吐槽大会 吐槽者Jeff Ross尤其本人配音
参加过多届吐槽大会 正在吐槽"坐鸭"

347
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,175
事实上 我有次碰见他
In fact, I once caught him trying

348
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:40,443
在勾搭一个妓鸭
to pick up a quack whore.

349
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,014
好吧 别笑了
All right, calm down.

350
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,016
我们都有犯错的时候
We all make bad choices.

351
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,253
喂
Hello?

352
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:51,555
Lois 我希望你坐稳了

我有事情要告诉你
I got something to tell ya.

354
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:54,157
天呐 出什么事了

355
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:56,076
一切都还好吗 是Chris出事了吗
Is everything okay? Is it Chris?

356
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:57,544
不 我是Peter 你老公
No, it's Peter, your husband.

357
00:13:57,612 --> 00:13:59,179
不过我打电话有要紧事说
But I'm calling with big news.

358

Peter, you know you're terrible at patter songs.

361
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:06,453

Patrick Pewterschmidt 你被逮捕了
Patrick Pewterschmidt, you're under arrest

397
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,445
你涉嫌谋杀 呃…
for the murder of, uh... (bleep)

398
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,547
我不知道那孩子叫什么
I didn't get the kid's name.

399
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,049
我们真应该弄清楚
We're supposed to do that.

400
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,567
Lois 你叫警察来的
Lois, you called the cops?

401
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,371
Patrick 你是我哥哥 我爱你 但你不是好人
Patrick, you're my brother and I love you, but you're not well.

402
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,622
可我现在好多了
But I'm better now.

403
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,890
我已经跟过去决裂了
I've put my past behind me.

404
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,224
省省吧 Patrick
Save it, Patrick.

405
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:45,027
我们都知道你从精神病院逃出 杀了…
We know you escaped from the asylum and killed...

406
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,896
Bill 我们现在用"Bill"来指代他
Bill, we'll just call him "Bill" for now.

407
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,564
逃出 我-我没有逃啊
Escaped? I-I didn't escape.

408
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:51,200
就在今天上午 一位很友善的先生打开了我房间的门
Just this morning, a very nice gentleman opened my cell door

409
00:15:51,268 --> 00:15:52,968
说我可以自由离开了
and said I was free to go.

410
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,338
呵 编的真好 不过没用
Yeah, nice try. That's not how it works.

411
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:58,441
Patrick舅舅 为什么你要勒死胖人
Uncle Patrick, why do you strangle fat people?

412
00:15:58,508 --> 00:15:59,809
大概是奇怪的恋物癖行为
It's probably a weird fetish thing.

413
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,377
有些罪犯是这样的
Some criminals have 'em.

414
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:03,112
比如那些过分讲究细节的劫匪
Like those anal-retentive bandits

415
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,780
他们去年抢劫了Quahog银行
who robbed Quahog Bank last year.

416
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:07,283
听好了 举起手来 举直了
All right, hands in the air! Vertically!

417
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:09,185
两只胳膊必须互相平行
Both arms should be parallel to each other!

418
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,437
你 把这个袋子里装满干净的 无记号的钞票
You, fill this bag with clean, unmarked bills!

419
00:16:11,522 --> 00:16:13,924
不过首先把那个记事本放好 这样它才能跟
But first fix that notepad so it's at a right angle

420
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:15,392
你的桌角呈正确的角度
with the corner of your desk!

421
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:17,411
在桌面上整一整那摞收条
And tap that pile of receipts against a flat surface

422
00:16:17,495 --> 00:16:19,862
这样它们看起来才不会参差不齐
so they're not sticking out haphazardly!

423
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,230
还是这样吧 先别想什么钱了
You know what?! Forget about the money!

424
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,365
没个人都去拿一把扫帚
Everybody grab a broom!

425
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:23,566
我们把这地方好好打扫一番
We are straightening this place up!

426
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,220
好的 营员们
All right, campers,

427
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,889
在胖子扼杀者被抓到之前
until the Fat Guy Strangler is caught,

428
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,291
每个人都得呆在自己屋里
everyone has to stay inside their cabins.

429
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,893
现在我要清点一下人数
Now I'm gonna do a stomach count.

430
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,661
当我叫到你的名字 请回答
When I call your name, please respond.

431
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:36,695
Jenkins?

432
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:37,663
(stomach growls)

433
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:38,697
Robertson?

434
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:39,665
(stomach growls)

435
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,733
Davis?

436
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,568
(stomach growls) Elliot?

437
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:43,469
Elliot上哪儿去了
Where's Elliot?

438
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:44,937
我看他在睡觉吧
I think he's asleep.

439
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,473
Elliot Elliot 醒醒
Elliot? Elliot, wake up.

440
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,959
Elliot? 

441
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:52,862
我是Swanson警官
Officer Swanson here.

442
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,764
什么 我的天呐
What?! Oh, my God!

443
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,499
怎么了 Joe
What is it, Joe?

444
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,601
半小时前又一个营员被勒死了
Another camper was strangled half an hour ago.

445
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:00,870
可…也就是说…
But... that means...

446
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,038
Patrick不可能是凶手
Patrick can't be the killer.

447
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,007
我就是这么跟你们说的嘛
That's what I was trying to tell you.

448
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,642
收到了 我正在处理
Acknowledged. I'm on it.

449
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,411
Joe 你愿意为营里解决一个争端吗
Joe, would you settle a camp argument?

450
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,379
是"轰炸球"好 还是"躲避球"好
Is it "Bombardment" or "Dodgeball"?

451
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:10,379
bombardment是躲避球的一种升级版
会使用3种不同的球

452
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,147
躲避球
Dodgeball.

453
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:12,248
啊 你还是不懂
Ah, you don't know.

454
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:13,949
好吧 我还是发布全境通告
Well, I'd better put out an APB

455
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:15,484
到附近的各个城镇
to all the neighboring towns.

456
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:17,353
呃 杀手不会离开减肥营的
Oh, the murderer won't leave the camp.

457
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,321
什么 你刚才说什么
What? What are you talking about?

458
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:20,756
他在"进食"
He's "feeding."

459
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,892
他杀了两个人 而且会再杀人
He killed twice and he's gonna do it again.

460
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,511
他在那儿有许多地方可以藏身
He's got plenty of places to hide out there

461
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:27,062
也有数量充足受害者可以下手
and a fully stocked corral of victims.

462
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,514
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

463
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,399
相信我 我懂的
Trust me. I know.

464
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,585
其实 Joe 说不定Patrick真能帮上忙
You know, Joe, maybe Patrick can actually be of help.

465
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,037
我是说 还有谁更了解那人的想法
I mean, who better to get inside the mind of someone

466
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,373
除非他自己也勒死过胖子 不然怎么想得到
who's strangling fat people than someone who's done it himself?

467
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:38,707
是啊 给他个机会吧 Joe
Yeah, give him a chance, Joe.

468
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,543
就像我对非主流少年那样
Like I did with scary teenagers.

469
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,878
我曾经很害怕他们 直到我意识到
I used to be afraid of 'em, until I realized

470
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:44,213
他们只是被误解了
they were just misunderstood.

471
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:46,115
嗨 死胖子 把你钱包给我
Hey, fat ass, give me your wallet!

472
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,416
我可以给你钱包
I could give you my wallet,

473
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,852
不过我觉得你真正想要的…
but what I think you really want...

474
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,187
是爱
is love.

475
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:52,855
是真的
It's true!

476
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,478
我要拿走你的鞋
I'm taking your shoes.

477
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,536
可怜的孩子
Poor kid.

478
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:08,938
其实 最诡异的是
You know, the weirdest thing is

479
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,556
他的床铺很靠近Chris的
his bunk is right next to Chris's.

480
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:11,957
是啊 还真是侥幸啊
Yeah, that was a close call.

481
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,993
哦 这可不仅是侥幸的问题
Oh, it was more than a close call.

482
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,662
你说过第一个受害者戴着棒球帽
You said the first victim was wearing a baseball cap,

483
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,197
第二个受害者是金发…
this second one is blond...

484
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,399
杀手并不是想杀这个孩子
The killer wasn't trying to murder this kid.

485
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,401
他是想杀Chris
He was trying to murder Chris.

486
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,936
我的天呐
Oh, my God!

487
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,188
为什么有人会想杀Chris
W-Why would anyone want to kill Chris?

488
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,640
我不知道 不过我知道
I don't know, but I do know

489
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,842
他现在的处境十分危险
that he's in a great deal of danger right now.

490
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,393
- 快点 咱们走 - 好的
- Come on. Let's go! - Yeah!

491
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:34,230
不过稍等 这是咱们最后的机会来玩"抢内裤"游戏了
But wait, this is our last chance to do a panty raid!

492
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:37,249
吔 减肥营 我们成功了
Yay! Fat camp! We got it!

493
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:39,201
哦 不 一阵强风
Oh, no, a gust of wind!

494
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,687
你 你在这儿干什么
Wha, what are you doing here?

495
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:00,589
你让我颜面尽失 Chris Griffin
You dishonored me, Chris Griffin.

496
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:03,242
没有人可以比我吃更多的热狗
No one has ever eaten more hot dogs than me.

497
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,060
现在你必须去死
Now you must die!

498
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,756
STEWIE：喂 死胖子
STEWIE: Hey, fat ass!

499
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,826
我有好消息(新闻)要告诉你
I got news for you.

500
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:40,996
世界新闻
The News of the World!

501
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,233
为什么机器人捧着死人
Why does robot hold dead people?!

502
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:45,951
那是未来还是过去
Is that future or past?!

503
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,877
老天呐 Stewie 你救了我的命
Oh, my God, Stewie, you saved my life!

504
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,862
啊 你也会为我做过同样的事 Chris
Ah, you would've done the same for me, Chris.

505
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,198
关键是 我们都平安无事
The important thing is, we're all gonna be okay.

506
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,549
对吗 大机器人
Right, Giant Robot?

507
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,863
查尔斯·山本…从大胃王冠军
Charles Yamamoto... went from eating champion

508
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:16,265
变成了冷血杀手
to cold-blooded killer.

509
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,499
谁能想到呢
Who'd have thought?

510
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,401
哦对了 Joe 他就是昨天
Wait a minute, Joe. That's the guy who opened

511
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,303
替我开门 告诉我
the door to my cell yesterday and told me

512
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:22,438
可以离开精神病院的人
I could leave the asylum.

513
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:24,106
哈 是那样吗
Huh. Is that right?

514
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,674
好吧 那一切都说得通了
Well, then it all makes sense.

515
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:26,942
山本想让这事看起来
Yamamoto wanted it to look like

516
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,911
像你自己出逃造成的
you broke out on your own.

517
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,346
那样的话 当他谋杀了Chris
That way, when he murdered Chris,

518
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:33,115
就必然由你来当替罪羊了
it was a cinch that you would take the blame.

519
00:20:33,183 --> 00:20:37,052
好吧 Patrick 看来我们欠你一个道歉
Well, Patrick, I guess we all owe you an apology.

520
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,087
Patrick?

521
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,022
他去哪儿了
Where did he go?

522
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,390
他刚才还在这儿的
He was just right here.

523
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,424
发生什么了
What happened?!

524
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,661
该死 他肯定已经逃跑了
Damn it! He must've gotten away!

525
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:46,929
这怎么可能呢
How is that possible?!

526
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,797
我不知道 不过我最好弄成
I don't know, but I'd better make it

527
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,399
搏斗过的样子
look like there was a struggle.

528
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:51,667
谁向我脸上打一拳
Someone punch me in the face.

529
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,453
我可真是你的好朋友呀
I'm a good friend to you.

530
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:58,478
Queen的Killer Queen
