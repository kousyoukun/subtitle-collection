我本来是能赢的 Chris
Well, I would, Chris,

37
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:20,281
但我太迷恋我现在的身材了
if I wasn't so obsessed with my figure.

38
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:21,599
等会儿
Wait a minute.

39
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,001
Chris 你曾经吃过东西么?
Chris, have <i>you</i> ever eaten anything?

40
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:24,686
我就从没停过

Ugh! Just give me the money.

44
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:33,561
Peter 我们不能花这50块
Peter, we're not spending $50

45
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,513
就为了让Chris塞一嘴热狗
so Chris can stuff his face with hot dogs.

46
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,815
好吧

我会自己想办法弄钱的
I'll figure out a way to get the cash myself.

51
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:49,577

53
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,881

讽刺过去黄色杂志的妹子都不流行剃毛

60
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:05,977
哇 Peter 你这有不少很赞的专辑啊

时间快到了
Time's almost up!

141

146
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:25,953
我的液囊边上长了些奇怪的囊肿
I get these weird cyst things right on the fringe of my sac.

147
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:27,622
我想去检查一下
I want to get 'em checked,

148
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,657
但我又怕他们会告诉我什么恐怖的结果
but I'm afraid of what they're gonna tell me.

149
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:31,659
他说得对 我可以的
He's right. I <i>can</i> do it!

150
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:41,786
冠军产生了

大胜之后的小憩
Relaxing after his big victory.

160
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:08,196
Peter 他这可不是在小憩
Peter, he's not relaxing.

161
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:10,064
他现在可疼的要命呢
He's in a great deal of pain.

162
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:12,467
妈的 难道你不明白对他做了什么吗
Damn it, don't you see what you did to him?

163
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:15,069
我让你别带他去那啥大胃王比赛
I told you not to take him to that eating competition,

164
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:16,587
你还故意无视我
and you deliberately defied me!

165
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:18,356
好了 你到底在说什么
All right, what's this really about?

166
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,491
Peter Chris已经很肥了
Peter, Chris is already overweight.

167
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,528
我们要对他的健康负责
We need to start taking responsibility for his health.

168
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:25,963
所以我决定给他去减肥训练营报名
So I decided to sign him up for fat camp.

169
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,900
什么? 妈 我不想去减肥营
What?! Mom, I don't want to go to fat camp!

170
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:31,335
抱歉 甜心 这是为了你好
I'm sorry, sweetie. It's for your own good.

171
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:34,305

That's where you belong!

176
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:43,981
Peter 别说了
Peter, stop it!

177
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,284
最好别让我在舞会看到你
And I'd better not see you at the big dance!

178
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:47,585
你 走了
Come on, you.

179
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,887
抱歉了 Chris 我得和他去了
Sorry, Chris. I-I'm gonna go with him.

185
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:22,442
那你们现在就准备丢下我了?
So you guys are just gonna leave me here?

186
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,344
是的 宝贝 训练营就是这样的

189
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:30,033
我不要去减肥营
I don't want to go to fat camp!

190
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:31,735
别这样 Chris 你妈说的对

191
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,170
这是为了你好
This'll be good for you.

192
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:35,038

你比我还要肥啊
You're fatter than I am!

194

196
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:41,044

199
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,449
而且他说得对
Besides, he's right.

200
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,618
你也应该坚持减掉点肥肉
You <i>could</i> stand to lose a few pounds yourself.

201
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,553
除非你认为自己做不到
Unless you don't think you could handle it.

202
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:51,355
噢 是么?
Oh, yeah?

203
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:52,522
但我觉得我可以

204
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,790
那是什么?
What was that?

205
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,392
你就别管那玩意儿了
Never you mind what that was.

206

太阳出来起床啦
Rise and shine, everyone!

207
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:02,916

210
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:06,870
- 没了 - 别想骗我
- No. - Don't lie to me.

211
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:08,438
我爹可是律师

212
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,973

245
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,445
然后我边上有个人

246
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:23,246
正在吃一桶炸鸡

虽然我不认识那人
And even though I didn't know the guy,

251
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,221
但我直接就吃了起来
I just dug in

252
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:33,290
开始往嘴里塞鸡肉
and started stuffing that chicken into my mouth.

253
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:34,424
噢 囧啊

杀掉我们的乐趣
the satisfaction of killing us.

263
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:59,199

268
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,507
是哪个机器人
It's that robot!

269
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,776
他杀掉了皇后乐队 现在他要来杀我了
He killed Queen, and now he's going to kill me!

270
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:11,078
他没有杀掉他们
He didn't kill Queen.

271
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:12,212

See? It, It's just an album. Look.

277
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,289
给 你想打它么?
Here, you want to hit it?

278
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,958
呃… 我一般会对那些能把它们放进嘴里
Well... I'm usually more comfortable around things

279
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,993
的东西感觉舒服一些
if I can put them in my mouth.

280
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,845
那 我能把它放到嘴里么?
So, can I put it in my mouth?

281
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,963
我想可以
I guess.

282
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,033
这就是张专辑啊
This is just an album!

283
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,552
是呀 这就是我一直想告诉你的
Yeah, that's what I've been trying to tell you.

284
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,421
那你能原谅我么?
So, you know, can you forgive me?

285
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,873
噢 也许吧
Oh, I suppose so.

286
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,808
我是说 麦哲伦都原谅那个"看见陆地了"恶搞男
I mean, Magellan forgave the "Land Ho" prankster.

287
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:43,110
看见陆地了哟
Land ho!

288
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,361
在哪? 哪呢?
Where?! Where?!

289
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:45,762
骗你的 丢脸了吧 二货
Psych! Made you look, loser.

290
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,097
还好那不是真的陆地
Good thing there wasn't land

291
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,065
否则你就得穿着你那
or else you'd have to meet the natives

292
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,767
- 沾了芥末的衬衣见土著人了 - 什么污渍?
- with that mustard stain on your shirt. - What stain?

293
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:54,337
呃 我怎么就把你给一起带上了呢?
Ugh! Why did I even bring you on this trip?!

294
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:55,739
因我是最他妈好的陆地侦察员
Because I'm the best damn land spotter

295
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:56,940
在整个欧洲
in all of Europe.

296
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,475
这倒没错 你确实是最好的
It's true. You are the best.

297
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,444
那是 我用不着你来告诉我
Yeah, I don't need you to tell me that.

298
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:06,349
爸 我实在是受不了了
Dad, I can't take this anymore.

299
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:10,387
我又累又饿
I'm so tired and I'm so hungry.

300
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,239
我有主意了 Chris 跟着我
I got an idea, Chris. Follow me.

301
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:14,891
我们干什么去?
What are we doing?

302
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,360
我以前在书里看到过这样的一片森林
I saw a forest like this in a book one time,

303
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:19,629
所以我知道在这儿某处有座姜饼屋
and I know there's a gingerbread house out here somewhere.

304
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:19,629
格林童话

305
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,031
你觉得我们找的到吗?
Do you think we could find it?!

306
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:22,983
必须的 Chris 我们一定要吃点东西
We have to, Chris. We-we gotta eat something

307
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,284
而不是减肥营给我们吃的
besides what they're feeding us.

308
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,019
我明白你的意思 老爸
I know what you mean, Dad.

309
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:28,688
我都饿到能吃掉这个死营员了
I'm so hungry I could eat this dead camper.

310
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:29,990
我勒个去
Holy crap!

311
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:38,465
好吧 我们显然还没有收集到所有的证据
Well, we clearly don't have all the evidence yet,

312
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,600
但是这从来也不能阻挡我们 对吗?
but that's never stopped us before, right?

313
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:46,022
噢 这儿就我一个条子
Oh, there's no other cops here.

314
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,025
我有一件事我们都很清楚 这孩子是被谋杀的
But we do know one thing, this kid was murdered.

315
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,528
谋杀? 这世上谁
Murdered?! Who in the world

316
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:52,762
会杀掉一个营员啊
would want to kill a camper?

317
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,364
别看我
Don't look at me.

318
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:54,364
《黑色星期五》系列中的杀人狂Jason
杀露营者出身

319
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:55,949
我只是来这放下我儿子的
I'm just here to drop off my son.

320
00:12:56,033 --> 00:13:00,453
Justin? Justin 这对我没用的
Justin? Justin, that does not work for me.

321
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:00,453
他是不死之身

322
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,289
看其那里有外伤痕迹
And it looks like there are signs of trauma

323
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:03,790
就在喉咙附近
around the throat.

324
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,759
有人勒死了这个小胖子
Somebody strangled this fat kid.

325
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,160
等等 他是被勒死的?
Wait. He was strangled?

326
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:08,228
是啊
Yeah.

327
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,629
Joe 我知道是谁干的了
Joe, I know who did it.

328
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:11,164
你知道? 是谁?
You do? Who?

329
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:12,916
呃 我知道唯一
Well, there's only one person I know

330
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,634
喜欢勒死胖子的人就是
who likes to strangle fat guys:

331
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,453
Patrick Pewterschmidt.

332
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,254
他是谁?
Who's that?

333
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,556
我的小舅子
My brother-in-law.

334
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:22,809
<i>People call him</i> <i>"The Fat Guy Strangler."</i>

335
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:26,296
<i>He's always had a thing</i> <i>for strangling fat guys.</i>

336
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,832
I guess he fits the profile, Peter,

337
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,101
but Lois's brother is locked up in an asylum.

338
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,303
Well, either way, we gotta get out of here.

339
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:34,738
Otherwise, we're just sitting ducks!

340
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:37,574
Hey, we all know this guy goes for the classy ladies.

341
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,175
In fact, I once caught him trying

342
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:40,443
to pick up a quack whore.

343
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,014
All right, calm down.

344
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,016
We all make bad choices.

345
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,253
Hello?

346
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:51,555
Lois, I hope you're sitting down.

347
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,756
I got something to tell ya.

348
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:54,157
Oh, God, what's wrong?

349
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:56,076
Is everything okay? Is it Chris?

350
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:57,544
No, it's Peter, your husband.

351
00:13:57,612 --> 00:13:59,179
But I'm calling with big news.

352
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:00,880
I was Anita in the camp production

353
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:02,315
of <i>West Side Story.</i>

354
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,784
Peter, you know you're terrible at patter songs.

355
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:06,453
I did okay.

361
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,632
One of the fat kids at camp got strangled!

362
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,267
Oh, my God!

363
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:22,135
Yeah, but don't worry. It ain't your brother.

364
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:23,570
He's still locked up in that asylum.

365
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:26,006
Um, Mom...

366
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,841
look who dropped by for a visit.

367
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,111
Hello, Lois.

368
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:32,512
Patrick!

369
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,780
It's been a long time.

370
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:36,132
Peter, he's here!

371
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,134
Wait a second, Lois, I want to go back

372
00:14:38,202 --> 00:14:40,003
to what you said about my patter singing.

373
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:41,304
Who gives you the right?!

374
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:42,706
You know I carried <i>Pirates of Penzance</i>

375
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:45,275

before Patrick hurts anyone else!

382

If he even lays a finger on my family,

383
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,875
I'll do to him what I did to the Riddler.

384

Oh, Peter, thank God!

386
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,442
Patrick Pewterschmidt, you're under arrest

387
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,445
for the murder of, uh...

388
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,547
I didn't get the kid's name.

389
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,049
We're supposed to do that.

390
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,567
Lois, you called the cops?

391
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,371
Patrick, you're my brother and I love you, but you're not well.

392
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,622
But I'm better now.

393
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,890
I've put my past behind me.

394
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,224
Save it, Patrick.

395
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:45,027
We know you escaped from the asylum and killed...

396
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,896
Bill, we'll just call him "Bill" for now.

397
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,564
Escaped? I-I didn't escape.

398
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:51,200
Just this morning, a very nice gentleman opened my cell door

399
00:15:51,268 --> 00:15:52,968
and said I was free to go.

400
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,338
Yeah, nice try. That's not how it works.

401
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:58,441
Uncle Patrick, why do you strangle fat people?

402
00:15:58,508 --> 00:15:59,809
It's probably a weird fetish thing.

403
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,377
Some criminals have 'em.

404
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:03,112
Like those anal-retentive bandits

405
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,780
who robbed Quahog Bank last year.

406
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:07,283
All right, hands in the air! Vertically!

407
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:09,185
Both arms should be parallel to each other!

408
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,737
You, fill this bag with clean, unmarked bills!

409
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:14,724
But first fix that notepad so it's at a right angle

410
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,192
with the corner of your desk!

411
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,411
And tap that pile of receipts against a flat surface

412
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:19,862
so they're not sticking out haphazardly!

413
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,230
You know what?! Forget about the money!

414
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,365
Everybody grab a broom!

415
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:23,566
We are straightening this place up!

416
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,220
All right, campers,

417
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,889
until the Fat Guy Strangler is caught,

418
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,291
everyone has to stay inside their cabins.

419
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,893
Now I'm gonna do a stomach count.

420
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,661
When I call your name, please respond.

421
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:36,695
Jenkins?

422
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:38,697
Robertson?

423
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,733
Davis?

424
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,568
Elliot?

425
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:43,469
Where's Elliot?

426
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:44,937
I think he's asleep.

427
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,473
Elliot? Elliot, wake up.

428
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,959
Elliot?

429
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:52,862
Officer Swanson here.

430
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,764
What?! Oh, my God!

431
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,499
What is it, Joe?

432
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,601
Another camper was strangled half an hour ago.

433
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:00,870
But... that means...

434
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,038
Patrick can't be the killer.

435
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,007
That's what I was trying to tell you.

436
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,642
Acknowledged. I'm on it.

437
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,411
Joe, would you settle a camp argument?

438
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,379
Is it "Bombardment" or "Dodgeball"?

439
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,147
Dodgeball.

440
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:12,248
Ah, you don't know.

441
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:13,949
Well, I'd better put out an APB

442
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:15,484
to all the neighboring towns.

443
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:17,353
Oh, the murderer won't leave the camp.

444
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,321
What? What are you talking about?

445
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:20,756
He's "feeding."

446
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,892
He killed twice and he's gonna do it again.

447
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,511
He's got plenty of places to hide out there

448
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:27,062
and a fully stocked corral of victims.

449
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,514
How do you know that?

450
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,399
Trust me. I know.

451
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,585
You know, Joe, maybe Patrick can actually be of help.

452
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,037
I mean, who better to get inside the mind of someone

453
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,373
who's strangling fat people than someone who's done it himself?

454
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:38,707
Yeah, give him a chance, Joe.

455
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,543
Like I did with scary teenagers.

456
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,878
I used to be afraid of 'em, until I realized

457
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:44,213
they were just misunderstood.

458
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:46,115
Hey, fat ass, give me your wallet!

459
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,416
I <i>could</i> give you my wallet,

460
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,852
but what I think you really want...

461
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,187
is love.

462
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:52,855
It's true!

463
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,478
I'm taking your shoes.

464
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,536
Poor kid.

465
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:08,938
You know, the weirdest thing is

466
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,556
his bunk is right next to Chris's.

467
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:11,957
Yeah, that was a close call.

468
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,993
Oh, it was more than a close call.

469
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,662
You said the first victim was wearing a baseball cap,

470
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,197
this second one is blond...

471
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,399
The killer wasn't trying to murder <i>this</i> kid.

472
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,401
He was trying to murder Chris.

473
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,936
Oh, my God!

474
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,188
W-Why would anyone want to kill Chris?

475
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,640
I don't know, but I do know

476
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,842
that he's in a great deal of danger right now.

477
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,393
Come on. Let's go! Yeah!

478
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:34,230
But wait, this is our last chance to do a panty raid!

479
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:37,249
Yay! Fat camp! We got it!

480
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:39,201
Oh, no, a gust of wind!

481
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,687
Wha, what are you doing here?

482
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:00,589
You dishonored me, Chris Griffin.

483
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:03,242
No one has ever eaten more hot dogs than me.

484
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,060
Now you must die!

485
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,756
Hey, fat ass!

486
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,826
I got news for you.

487
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:40,996
The <i>News of the World!</i>

488
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,233
Why does robot hold dead people?!

489
00:19:44,301 --> 00:19:45,951
Is that future or past?!

490
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,877
Oh, my God, Stewie, you saved my life!

491
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,862
Ah, you would've done the same for me, Chris.

492
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,198
The important thing is, we're all gonna be okay.

493
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,549
Right, Giant Robot?

494
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,863
Charles Yamamoto... went from eating champion

495
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:16,265
to cold-blooded killer.

496
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,499
Who'd have thought?

497
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,401
Wait a minute, Joe. That's the guy who opened

498
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,303
the door to my cell yesterday and told me

499
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:22,438
I could leave the asylum.

500
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:24,106
Huh. Is that right?

501
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,674
Well, then it all makes sense.

502
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:26,942
Yamamoto wanted it to look like

503
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,911
you broke out on your own.

504
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,346
That way, when he murdered Chris,

505
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:33,115
it was a cinch that you would take the blame.

506
00:20:33,183 --> 00:20:37,052
Well, Patrick, I guess we all owe you an apology.

507
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,087
Patrick?

508
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,022
Where did he go?

509
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,390
He was just right here.

510
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,424
What happened?!

511
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,661
Damn it! He must've gotten away!

512
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:46,929
How is that possible?!

513
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,797
I don't know, but I'd better make it

514
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,399
look like there was a struggle.

515
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:51,667
Someone punch me in the face.

516
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,453
I'm a good friend to you.

517
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:58,478
