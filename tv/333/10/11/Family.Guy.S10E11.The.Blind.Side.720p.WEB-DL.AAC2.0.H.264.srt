00:00:01,746 --> 00:00:04,915
# It seems today
that all you see #

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:08,301
# Is violence in movies
and sex on TV #

3
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:11,772
# But where are those
good old-fashioned values #

4
00:00:11,823 --> 00:00:14,741
# On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:18,328
# Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:21,531
# Lucky there's a man
who positively can do #

7
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:23,133
# All the things that make us

8
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:24,918
# Laugh and cry

9
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:29,907
# He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy! #

12
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:40,872
Stewie, what are
you doing?

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,541
Oh, just doing a
little tai chi.

14
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:45,027
You know how the Asians
look 30 until they're 60?

15
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,261
This is why.

16
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:47,913
Of course, then they
suddenly look 100,

17
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:49,047
but cross that
bridge, you know?

18
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,248
Is this a Japanese thing?

19
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,230
No, Chinese. The Japanese have
a whole other thing going on.

20
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,631
Hey, you want to see a movie?

21
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:57,581
No, we're Japanese, let's watch
a schoolgirl bang an octopus.

22
00:00:57,727 --> 00:00:58,663
Yeah!

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,963
Suction cup feel good!

24
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,519
And of course the most
important part of any workout

25
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,971
is a proper cool
down and a stretch.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,006
What? What is it?

27
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,875
I got a splinter!

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,998
Oh, my God, Stewie, what is it?!

29
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:22,282
Oh, he's just
got a splinter.

30
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:23,784
Oh, my poor baby.

31
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,086
It's 'cause these old stairs
are just falling apart.

32
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:27,387
It's not just the stairs.

33
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,556
Meg has spent two days
pinned under a roof beam.

34
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,961
Let's just focus
on the stairs, Brian.

35
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,815
Morning, Opie.

36
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:40,784
Hey, what's going on?
You going somewhere?

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,271
You got fired? Why?!

38
00:01:46,157 --> 00:01:47,591
Oh, well, it's no wonder

39
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:49,326
they finally caught you
doing that in here.

40
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:50,760
I mean, the underside
of your desk

41
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:52,462
looks like Carlsbad Caverns.

42
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:57,751
Griffin, say hello
to Opie's replacement, Stella.

43
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,036
Nice to meet you.

44
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,237
W-What is this?

45
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:01,805
We doing a new
secret handshake now?

46
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:03,874
No, Griffin, she's deaf.

47
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:05,676
Oh. Can she
read lips?

48
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:07,210
Yes, I can.

49
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:10,280
So if I do this, I can talk
about what a sweet rack she has?

50
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,899
Yes, but try not to make
a boob-honking gesture

51
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,668
with your other hand
while you're saying it.

52
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:16,236
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

53
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,721
I'm used to people being

54
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:20,524
a little uncomfortable
with me at first.

55
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:23,377
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

56
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,828
Yeah, actually, I do.

57
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,031
Are your other senses better
on account of you can't hear?

58
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,784
Like, can you smell my farts
before they even come out?

59
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,719
'Cause I got one
in the pocket right now,

60
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:35,522
and I want to know if I need
to feel self-conscious about it.

61
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,391
I can't smell it, no.

62
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,543
I might be able
to see it, though.

63
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,296
A lot of people make small
movements when they fart.

64
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,482
They twitch their
eye or something.

65
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,484
Oh, like subtle
giveaways, huh?

66
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:50,670
All right, well, t-tell me
if you can see when it happens.

67
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,173
You just farted.

68
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,474
Oh, my God,
you saw that?!

69
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,210
You can see all my tiny,
subtle movements?

70
00:02:58,429 --> 00:02:59,863
You just did it again.

71
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,498
Well, this is
gonna be a delight!

72
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,150
I don't know
why Lois always said

73
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,218
she had problems
with female coworkers.

74
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:07,888
So Abby, Elaine and Janet have
their little lunch clique,

75
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,156
and of course
I'm not invited.

76
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,307
Seems like
you're doing everything

77
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:11,641
and they're doing nothing.

78
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,577
Well, I don't know,
but what I do know is

79
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:14,895
that in the staff meeting,
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

80
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,396
Christina said my inventory
system wasn't feasible.

81
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:17,931
She's obviously
threatened by you.

82
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,649
But when the associate sales
manager came back in the room...

83
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:20,967
It's ridiculous,
and I support you fully.

84
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,402
...she told him the idea
as if it was hers...

85
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,503
You can't let them
get to you.

86
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:24,971
They're jealous
of what you have.

87
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,157
It's nothing to do with you,
and everything to do with them.

88
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:29,025
Only you can
prevent forest fires.

89
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,182
Hey, Peter, you ready
to go to the Clam?

90
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:36,566
Whoa, who's the hot chick?

91
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:37,818
Oh, that's Stella.

92
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,119
You don't have to whisper;
she's deaf.

93
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:40,137
Really?

94
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:41,404
Oh, my God, that's hot.

95
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,106
I didn't know you had
a thing for deaf chicks.

96
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,424
Any kind of disabled
chick, Peter.

97
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,759
They can do
things to you

98
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:47,394
that regular chicks
don't even think of.

99
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:48,762
Besides, you know me.

100
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,247
I'm into a lot of
different stuff.

101
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:57,850
- What, did you hear something?
- No, it's all good. - All right.

102
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,597
You know, Chris,
a little friendly advice.

103
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,266
Uh, you're gonna
start dating soon;

104
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,934
probably good
to get in the habit

105
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,452
of chewing
with your mouth closed.

106
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,071
Doesn't bother me, I'm just--
you know, one friend to another.

107
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,040
Oh, what, you got
a problem with me?

108
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,543
You think I'm gross?

109
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,412
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

110
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,201
Yeah. This is what you are
and this is what I am.

111
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:29,886
Peter, hurry up!

112
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:30,987
You're missing dinner.

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,397
Lois, what the hell?!

114
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:42,198
Oh, my God, Peter,
are you okay?!

115
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,550
What the hell happened
to the stairs?!

116
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:44,618
They're all
slippery now!

117
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,319
I had them replaced,
remember?

118
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,889
The old ones were so rough,
and Stewie got that splinter,

119
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,525
so I thought replacing
the wood was the best way to go.

120
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,026
When'd you do that?!

121
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:55,362
The other day, when you spent
all that time at the drugstore.

122
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,663
Oh, yeah.

123
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,064
Couldn't figure out
if that Hispanic lady

124
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:58,965
worked there or not.

125
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,538
Um... excuse me.

126
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:09,543
Excuse me.

127
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,712
Boy, I wonder where the
shampoos are around here.

128
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,385
I said, "I wonder where the
shampoos are around here."

129
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,988
Oh, for God's sake,
I almost thought

130
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,056
you were a
regular person.

131
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,324
Where's the shampoo?!

132
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:29,462
What the hell?

133
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:36,586
Hey, guys,
all the action's over here!

134
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:39,072
Quagmire, what
is all this?

135
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,024
Peter's new coworker
gave me an idea.

136
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,543
Welcome to
Disabled Ladies Night.

137
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,045
Mine are made
from teak.

138
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,446
What are yours
made from?

139
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,316
Yeah, mine are actually just
pressboard with wood veneer.

140
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,850
I can't get wet.

141
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,737
Oh. I think I
see my friends.

142
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,775
Hey, uh, you guys
enjoy the carnival.

143
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,611
I'm gonna get
a drink at the bar.

144
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,580
Hey, uh, anyone
sitting here?

145
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:04,764
No, go ahead.

146
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,166
Thanks.

147
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,134
Hey, would you like
to go out sometime?

148
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,603
Wow, that was fast.

149
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,788
Yeah, well, you know, I read
somewhere that women decide

150
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:14,007
within the first seven seconds
if they're interested in you

151
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:16,076
or not, so I figured I
wouldn't waste anybody's time.

152
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,077
Fair enough.

153
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,461
Sure, let's go out.

154
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:19,529
- Really?
- Yeah.

155
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:21,431
Like you said,
I've already decided.

156
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:22,432
I'm Kate.

157
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,700
I'm Brian.

158
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:25,669
Hey, uh, you want
to go outside?

159
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:26,703
Maybe a little
quieter.

160
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:28,121
Sure.

161
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,244
Oh, my God, I...

162
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,962
Hey, check out Brian
with the blind chick.

163
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,297
Hey, don't worry, Brian,

164
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,732
you're still doing
better than Quagmire.

165
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,899
He got a hooker.

166
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,768
Ha!

167
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,236
No, no, but she is
a prostitute.

168
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:55,681
Listen, you know, we can do
something else if you want.

169
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,116
Why? I'm having a good time.

170
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,634
Well, I mean, I
just don't know

171
00:06:58,702 --> 00:07:01,537
how much fun it is for a blind
person to go to the movies.

172
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:04,107
Brian, blind people
go to the movies all the time.

173
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,508
We just listen.

174
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:08,144
I might be blind, but my brain
has been trained to listen

175
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:11,481
to any movie and know exactly
what's happening on screen.

176
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:13,516
Like, I loved Titanic.

177
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:16,302
I'm the king of the world!

178
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,196
So you sure you don't
need me to come in?

179
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,315
Maybe show you
to your bed.

180
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,517
Pretty sure I can
find it, thanks.

181
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,186
Maybe next time I'll
have trouble, though.

182
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,354
You might have to help
me find it next time.

183
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,856
So there's a next time.

184
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:37,840
Definitely.

185
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:38,808
Great.

186
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,310
Well, all right, good night.

187
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,381
Ugh! Our stupid
neighbor's dog barks 24/7.

188
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,049
God, I hate dogs.

189
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,568
Y-You do?

190
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,405
Yeah, they're just slobbery,
annoying, needy little bastards.

191
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,507
I'm just not really a
dog person, I guess.

192
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,909
Oh. Uh, yeah, me neither.

193
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,728
Dog people can get
pretty annoying.

194
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:00,746
Wow, this is
a nice apartment you have.

195
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,114
Is this your dog?

196
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,351
Yes. Isn't he the cutest
little cutie wutie?

197
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,853
Look how cute he is.

198
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,221
Yes, he's very cute.

199
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,655
Yes, he's cute.

200
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,707
Yes, he's cute,
cute, cute, cute.

201
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,593
Look at him. Look
at him. Look at him.

202
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,727
Okay.

203
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,963
Look at it! Look at
that face! Come on!

204
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,781
Look at that face!
You look at him!

205
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,349
Look at that
face!

206
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,854
Hey, guys, this is
driving me nuts.

207
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,739
Was one of the dwarves
named Snappy?

208
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:27,907
Kind of well dressed?

209
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:29,559
Or am I-I just making that up?

210
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:35,948
Oh, my God, Dad!

211
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,316
Dad, are you okay?!

212
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,985
Damn it, I hate
these new stairs!

213
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,253
Yeah, I'm fine.

214
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,454
I'll just--
I'm-I'm just gonna

215
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,389
lie here until the
pain goes away.

216
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,791
What are you
guys watching?

217
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,059
<i>We now return to
the first time travel movie</i>

218
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,961
<i>with a perfectly functioning
time machine.</i>

219
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,663
All right, if I'm correct,

220
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,266
this should land us
in six million B.C.

221
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:56,853
Quick!
Get us out of here!

222
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,373
Boy, that was close.

223
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,741
Oh, my God,
where's Frank?!

224
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,042
I'm over here.

225
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,277
Oh, okay.

226
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:13,102
Brian, if I ever
take up roller derby,

227
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,770
what do you think
my name should be?

228
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:17,940
Bruisin' B. Anthony,
Alicia Sleaze or Quahag?

229
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:19,742
How about Harlot O'Scara?

230
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,027
Aw, you dick,
that's genius.

231
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,261
How'd your date go?

232
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,163
Aw, went great.
We had an awesome time.

233
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,865
She's really smart,
really funny.

234
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,133
Cute?
Yeah, hot, actually.

235
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,601
I don't know
how she does it,

236
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,536
but she dresses really well
for a blind girl.

237
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,104
I mean, like,
her body is just...

238
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

239
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:35,875
What?

240
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:36,976
Don't "what" me.

241
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,210
You just said
she's blind.

242
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,412
You just said it.

243
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,813
You totally
buried the lead.

244
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,281
Yeah, well, it's not
that important.

245
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,783
So what if she can't see?

246
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,484
She's amazing
in every other way.

247
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,186
Okay, if you say so.

248
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,622
Hey, does she have really
weird, messed-up eyes?

249
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,123
No, her eyes are normal.

250
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,509
They're beautiful, actually.

251
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:55,378
Bet they're not.

252
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:58,064
- Bet they look like bowls of milk.
- Shut up.

253
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,532
You sure she isn't
just using you?

254
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,833
Seeing-eye dogs are expensive;

255
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,102
she may just be trying
to get one for free.

256
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,137
No, actually, she doesn't
want a seeing-eye dog.

257
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,406
She hates dogs.

258
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,507
What?

259
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,642
She doesn't like dogs.

260
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,177
She's just not a dog person.

261
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,945
What? Does she not
know you're a dog?

262
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,213
How is that possible?

263
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,849
Well, we-we haven't
done anything yet.

264
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,251
So I'm-I'm just gonna, I'm just
gonna avoid touching her

265
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,786
until a little more time
has passed.

266
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,422
And by the time I tell her,
I'll have impressed her so much

267
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,874
that the dog thing
won't even matter.

268
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:26,192
Yeah, well, good
luck with that.

269
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,227
You know, I like
your delusion, Brian.

270
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,863
Most people would say,
"I lost, I give up,"

271
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,765
but you, you just
keep trying.

272
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,634
You're like the
Dominican Republic.

273
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,702
Always killing the guy
in charge and saying,

274
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,672
"Oh, this new guy, this new
guy's gonna get it right."

275
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,273
Well, that's just because
I have confidence

276
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,608
that I'll find happiness.

277
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,110
Hey, anything's
possible, right?

278
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,778
I mean, I once
found the Batcave.

279
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,180
Look, you can't expect
to hire 60 workers

280
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,183
to dig a cave under your house
and then keep it a secret.

281
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,052
I mean, those men
live in this town.

282
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,655
Yeah, but I told them it was
part of a geological survey.

283
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,139
Batman, Batman.

284
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,693
They built a lazy Susan
for your nuclear car.

285
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,546
That's something they consider
conversation-worthy.

286
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:09,285
Gosh, this has been
an amazing week, Brian.

287
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:10,886
I still can't believe
you beat up

288
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,321
that guy
who tried to mug us.

289
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,739
That was a great dinner.

290
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:15,691
Yeah, I really liked that
salmon you recommended.

291
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,426
Yes. May I help
you gentlemen?

292
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:19,045
"Hey, you're in a
tough part of town.

293
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:20,629
Now, give me your
purse, doll face."

294
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:21,981
Hey, you get your
hands off that!

295
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,416
I don't care how many
of you there are--

296
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,784
you're not taking
this purse!

297
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,552
"Ah, the hell we aren't.
Let's get him, boys!"

298
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,170
Brian?
Stay right there, Kate.

299
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:29,338
I'll handle this.

300
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,475
Yeah, you like
that, huh?

301
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:33,592
"Ooh! This
guy's tough!"

302
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,429
"No fair. He
knows karate.

303
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,731
Usually, handsome guys ain't
so good with their fists."

304
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,901
And stay away from
my girlfriend.

305
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:43,185
Brian, I know
karate, too.

306
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:44,437
I can help you.

307
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:45,838
"You stay out
of this, lady!"

308
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,759
I got one!
I think I got one!

309
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,894
Yeah, yeah, but I-I
got the other four.

310
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,396
They're-they're
gone now.

311
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,630
They're gone.

312
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:56,565
Well, they took the
gift I had for you,

313
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,733
but at least
you're okay.

314
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,468
And that trip
to the Eiffel Tower

315
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:00,936
was just amazing.

316
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,975
Are we almost
at the top?

317
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:07,793
Yeah, just a
few more steps.

318
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,712
Here we are.

319
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:11,964
Ah, the winds of Paris.

320
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:13,632
Isn't that what they say?

321
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,751
Oh, that breeze
is gorgeous.

322
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,187
And I think I smell...
croissants?

323
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:19,472
Do you?

324
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:21,357
You have an amazing
sense of smell.

325
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:22,558
Oh, there it is.

326
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:23,893
There's what?
Oh, nothing.

327
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,311
Just the, uh,
Goodyear blimp.

328
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:27,780
It says, "I love you,
Kate," all in lights.

329
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:29,532
Here in Paris?

330
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,884
Yeah, it's... it's here for
Wimbledon or something.

331
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,235
Oh, my God.

332
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,370
That's the most
romantic thing

333
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:35,771
anybody's ever
done for me.

334
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,073
Well, get used to it.

335
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,657
You're going to be
hearing a lot of things

336
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:39,892
I've done for you.

337
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,014
<i>We now return to True Blood.</i>

338
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:46,949
Hi. I'm a nude vampire.

339
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,251
Hi. I'm a nude werewolf.

340
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,719
And that's the show!

341
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,288
Peter, come downstairs.

342
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,956
That gay show you like is on.

343
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,091
Coming!

344
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:16,912
Damn it!

345
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,564
Oh, my God, Peter.
Are you okay?

346
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,266
No, I am not okay!

347
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,168
Nothing about this
is okay!

348
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,836
You just need
to be more careful

349
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,371
coming down the stairs.
That's all.

350
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,323
Easy for you to say.

351
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,475
This is stressing
the crap out of me.

352
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,077
Like when we had that
easily startled wallpaper.

353
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,447
Aah!

354
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:43,973
Well, it's getting late.

355
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,357
I should probably go.

356
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:47,710
Brian, this is like
our sixth date.

357
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:49,278
I'm beginning to feel
like you're not

358
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:50,613
attracted to me
or something.

359
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,331
No, I... Oh,
my God, I'm...

360
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,799
I'm so attracted
to you. I...

361
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,502
So why haven't we
done anything about it?

362
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,337
I-I just... you
know, sometimes

363
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,839
taking things
slower is better.

364
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,841
Just ask any sloth.

365
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:05,144
<i>Hey, is sometimes
taking things slower better?</i>

366
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,785
Yeah.

367
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:16,288
I just... I like
you a lot, and I...

368
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,590
I don't want to
ruin anything

369
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,958
by moving too
fast, you know?

370
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,993
'Cause sometimes,
when you...

371
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,681
Brian, you never told me
you had a beard.

372
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:27,149
I love beards.

373
00:14:27,217 --> 00:14:28,517
Oh. Yeah.

374
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:30,719
No, hey, I'm bearding
it up over here.

375
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,573
Hey, Brian, would you be cool
with meeting my parents?

376
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:35,908
They're in town
this weekend,

377
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:37,493
and I thought we
could all have dinner.

378
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:39,261
Uh... sure.

379
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:42,064
Are they... are they
driving themselves?

380
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,668
If you're asking
if they can see, yes.

381
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:48,204
And since you can see...

382
00:14:48,271 --> 00:14:50,906
why don't you tell me
how these look?

383
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,841
Uh... they look
pretty damn great.

384
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:55,144
Then why don't you
tell me how they feel?

385
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:56,612
Uh, next time.

386
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,580
Some things are
worth waiting for.

387
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,100
Wow. You're really
a true gentleman.

388
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,668
Yep, not too
many of us left.

389
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:12,159
Stewie,
I need your help.

390
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:13,177
What? What is it?

391
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:14,695
I have a crisis situation here.

392
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,280
Kate wants me
to meet her parents.

393
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,132
Hey, guys.

394
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:21,618
Just gonna...
gonna take this.

395
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,954
Thank you.

396
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:25,539
What the hell
am I going to do?

397
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:26,874
All right, all right,
just calm down.

398
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,308
Calm down?

399
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:29,927
We're all supposed to have
dinner tomorrow night,

400
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:32,179
and her parents
are going to see that I'm a dog.

401
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:38,519
Don't worry, Brian.

402
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:39,753
I'll come up
with something.

403
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:41,422
Remember, I'm the
guy who came up

404
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:43,040
with the choreography
to Showgirls.

405
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:45,275
#

406
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,961
Okay, stop.
Stop. Stop.

407
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:49,497
Elizabeth, darling,
too much hands, not enough hips.

408
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:50,948
Can I just show you?

409
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,502
One, two, three, four.

410
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,687
I'm dancing from my vagina.

411
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,472
One, two, three, four.

412
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,457
I'm grinding, I'm grinding.

413
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,510
Orgasm eyes, orgasm eyes.

414
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,762
And we're done.

415
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,265
You do 20% that,
and we got a movie.

416
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,488
Peter, what
is all this?

417
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,589
Oh, hi, Lois.

418
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:16,891
I live upstairs now.

419
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,159
What?
That's right.

420
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:19,994
I made a nest
of my old underwears

421
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,495
on which
to lay my eggs,

422
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,898
and I shall raise my young
in this room alone.

423
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,166
Peter, you're being an idiot.

424
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,300
Oh, really?

425
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:27,535
Would an idiot
have been able

426
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,220
to rig this rig
to that rig?

427
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:30,888
Peter, that's nothing.

428
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,840
Oh, is it?

429
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:39,113
I died! I died!

430
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,191
Oh, hi.
You must be Kate.

431
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:51,559
I'm Brian's nurse.

432
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,194
He's had a little accident,
I'm afraid.

433
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:55,229
Oh, my God, Brian!
Are you okay?

434
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:56,497
Ah, don't worry.
I'm fine.

435
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,282
I'm just sort of
bandaged up right now.

436
00:16:58,349 --> 00:16:59,700
You must be Kate's parents.

437
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,035
It's so nice
to meet you.

438
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:02,703
Well, it's lovely
to meet you, too.

439
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,371
So what happened?

440
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,957
What happened is this one's
a hero, is what happened.

441
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,193
Rescued two children
from a burning building.

442
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,694
Can you imagine?

443
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,880
Not quite in time-- they
were both horribly burned.

444
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,481
Have that sort of
"creme brulee" face

445
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,233
going on now, but he
saved their lives.

446
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,568
Oh, my, Brian.

447
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,303
I know, right?
So noble.

448
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,272
Plus he's the only
one of my patients

449
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,374
to never ask me
for hand work.

450
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:25,176
Such a gentleman.

451
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:26,277
Never even
tried anything

452
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:28,012
when I'm giving
him a sponge bath.

453
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,180
And I'm very
thorough.

454
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:30,814
I will wash the
abdominals.

455
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,383
Not all nurses
do, but I do.

456
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,651
And yes, sometimes
I graze it,

457
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:34,785
but you know what?

458
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:35,853
I'm a healthcare
professional.

459
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,421
It's what I do.
It's my work.

460
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,556
It's important
to me,

461
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:40,357
and this one
respects that.

462
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:43,260
And I'm very
grateful.

463
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,745
Why are you here again?

464
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,282
Oh, my God!
I am so, so sorry.

465
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,050
Uh, it's no problem.
Don't worry about it.

466
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:52,553
What's that smell?

467
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,455
It smells like
wet dog in here.

468
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:59,093
That is the... the
smell of backed up,

469
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,128
unreleased
genital essence.

470
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,797
As I said, he's been
an amazing gentleman.

471
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,849
Well, I'd like
to propose a toast.

472
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,785
To Brian and Kate.

473
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:09,720
I know we just met,
but you seem

474
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,522
like you're really good
for our daughter.

475
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,157
And risking your
life for those kids?

476
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,458
You're a good
guy, Brian.

477
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,227
A really good guy.

478
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:17,461
Wow. Thanks.

479
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,966
What's that
thumping noise?

480
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,701
- It's your tail.
- Stop wagging your tail.

481
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:25,336
I can't help it.
Do something.

482
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:30,124
Oh... oh, damn it.

483
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,792
I meant hold it,
not cut it off.

484
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:32,943
You weren't specific.

485
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:34,078
I've never done
this before.

486
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:35,496
Are you okay, Brian?

487
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,948
Yeah, I'm just so happy
to meet you both.

488
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,752
What the hell
are you...

489
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:43,921
I'm cauterizing your tail.
Trust me, I'm a nurse.

490
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:46,223
Brian?

491
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,424
What's going on
over there?

492
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,526
I think
they burned our dinner.

493
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:51,078
Oh, God, it hurts.
It hurts, Stewie.

494
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:52,596
Here's a little
morphine.

495
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:55,032
What the hell? You're not
gonna stick me with that thing.

496
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,800
<i>I don't think
that's a real nurse.</i>

497
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:58,352
Just hold still.
Pretend you're at the vet.

498
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:59,637
Vet?
I hate the vet!

499
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:02,589
There's a dog
in here!

500
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:06,176
Yes! Okay?

501
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:08,312
There's a dog in here.
I'm a dog!

502
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,352
I'm so sorry, Kate.

503
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,221
I-I know you hate
dogs, and I...

504
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,757
I wanted to tell you--
I-I really did--

505
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,592
but I-I just thought...

506
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,927
I thought, if we got to know
each other better first,

507
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:25,913
you would eventually
be able to see past it.

508
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:27,231
<i>"See."</i>

509
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,999
And I... I just... I
really care about you,

510
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,901
and I really want this
to work, and I'm...

511
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,970
I'm so sorry I didn't
tell you before.

512
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:35,255
Can you ever forgive me?

513
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:37,491
Do you think that you
can still be with me?

514
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,760
You know what, Brian?

515
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:42,046
I could have gotten over
the fact that you're a dog,

516
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:43,764
because I really do
care about you

517
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:45,499
and I feel like we had
a connection,

518
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,835
but I can't get over the fact
that you lied to me.

519
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:49,136
You screwed up, Brian.

520
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:50,971
And now you're
going to have to watch me

521
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,423
walk out that door.

522
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,257
Well, it sounds
like I'm needed outside.

523
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,031
Mom, what were
all those carpenters

524
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:18,232
doing here today?

525
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,034
Putting back our old
crappy stairs, Meg.

526
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:21,568
I didn't have a choice.

527
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,320
Yay! I love my old stairs!

528
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,941
Uh-oh,
I forgot to cut Joe down.

529
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,511
Joe, what are you
doing up there?

530
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:32,279
Enjoying Heaven, Bonnie.

531
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:33,881
Come join me.

532
00:20:33,948 --> 00:20:36,116
There's a gun in
my nightstand.

533
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,137
Brian, I know
you're upset

534
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,538
about what happened with
Kate and everything,

535
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:42,973
but I did have
one more thought.

536
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,341
Yeah, what's that?

537
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,642
Well, since Kate is blind,

538
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,344
you could probably just
do a different voice

539
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,079
and go out with her
all over again.

540
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:55,773
Hey. Are you Kate?

541
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:56,573
Yes.

542
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:59,531
- Hey, it's Noah from JDate.
- Oh, my God! Hi!
