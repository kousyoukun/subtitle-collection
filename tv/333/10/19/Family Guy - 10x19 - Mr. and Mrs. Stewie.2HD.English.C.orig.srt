12
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:38,123
Come on, Stewie. Hurry up.
I want to get good seats.

13
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:40,942
Ugh, I hate going to hear
authors read from their work.

14
00:00:40,993 --> 00:00:43,078
That Dr. Seuss reading
was dreadful.

15
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,313
And when the drugs
stopped numbing the pain,

16
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:47,315
the sex became
even more violent.

17
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:48,483
It doesn't rhyme.

18
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:50,352
The new stuff
doesn't rhyme!

19
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:53,288
Hey, there.

20
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:55,424
You a big fan
of Jonathan Franzen?

21
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:57,642
Oh, my God,
I worship him.

22
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,277
Yeah, yeah, of all
my writing students,

23
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:00,812
he's probably
done the best.

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,180
I'm sorry,
everybody.

25
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:04,916
Mr. Franzen has informed us
he's not coming.

26
00:01:04,984 --> 00:01:08,220
Like most real authors, he's
too good for this dumb town.

27
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:10,989
I hate it here.

28
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:12,858
Well, this crowd
was promised an author.

29
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:14,843
No!

30
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:17,028
Oh, well, you know, I guess
I should be getting back

31
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:18,163
to my dorm anyway.

32
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:19,297
I've got a short story due

33
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:20,949
for my creative writing
class tomorrow.

34
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:22,551
Oh, creative
writing, huh?

35
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:24,786
Well, if you'd like me to look
it over before you turn it in,

36
00:01:24,854 --> 00:01:26,338
I'd be happy to.
Really?

37
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:27,822
That'd be great.

38
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:29,458
Cool, cool,
I'll follow you in my car.

39
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:30,492
Come on. We're going.

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,094
All right,
hold on.

41
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,329
Is this what your parents are
paying all that tuition for--

42
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,198
so you can
 dogs?

43
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:46,291
I'll print up for you
what I have so far.

44
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,526
Okay, I'm gonna go
in there with her.

45
00:01:47,593 --> 00:01:49,177
You just sit out here
and be quiet.

46
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:50,979
Here, watch one of her
movies or something.

47
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:54,966
Ugh, <i>Charlie St. Cloud?</i>

48
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:56,902
A-And why are there
so many fingerprints on this?

49
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,039
Who's handling their <i>Charlie</i>
<i>St. Cloud</i> DVD all the time?

50
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,769
Lois, can I have
a Pop-Tart in bed, please?

51
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:15,504
Lois?

52
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:16,538
Hey, Chris?

53
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:18,073
Yeah?

54
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:20,759
Do you think Lois would be okay
if I ate a Pop-Tart in bed?

55
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:21,793
Probably.

56
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:22,961
Probably, right?

57
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:25,147
Lois, you in the bathroom?

58
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:33,872
Well, Mrs. Griffin,
you have three crushed ribs,

59
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,791
but I was able to stop
the internal bleeding.

60
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:38,627
Doctor, this has happened
seven times in the last month.

61
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:41,396
Peter rolls over in his sleep
and almost kills me.

62
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:42,664
I see.

63
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:43,698
Well, that sucks.

64
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,200
Look, I don't do it
on purpose.

65
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:47,068
Well, it looks like you got
a handle on it then.

66
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:48,286
No, we don't.

67
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:50,155
He practically
smothers me every night.

68
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:51,556
Well, are you hogging
the blankets?

69
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:52,757
No.

70
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:54,509
"Probably hogging
blankets."

71
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:56,962
And if he's not smothering me,
he's keeping me up all night

72
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:59,698
writing with that
giant plume of his.

73
00:02:59,765 --> 00:03:03,418
"Dearest Augustine,
I do hope this latest damp

74
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:04,936
has not aggravated
your gray lung."

75
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:06,571
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

76
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,890
"Matters stateside
have taken a tragic turn

77
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:10,942
"as this year's gourd crop
has fallen prey

78
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:12,861
"to a rather
unexpected infestation

79
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:14,229
of saltmarsh cutworms."

80
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:15,413
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

81
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:17,032
Peter, it's 4:00
in the morning.

82
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,533
Come to bed!

83
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:21,303
"Marital concerns continue
to bedevil me."

84
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:26,258
Look, I'm sorry.

85
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,860
I wasn't planning on
spending all night there.

86
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:31,463
Look, how about if I take
you to the park, huh?

87
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:34,299
Come on. You like
the park, right?

88
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,618
We're about to
pass the turnoff.

89
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:39,554
Here it comes.

90
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:41,540
You may take me
to the park.

91
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:48,747
Um, excuse me. I didn't
bring any of my toys.

92
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:50,115
Can I play with
some of yours?

93
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:52,033
No! Mine!

94
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:55,921
Are you all right?

95
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:57,222
I'm fine.

96
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,641
I-I didn't push him back
because he has leukemia.

97
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:00,709
My name's Penelope.

98
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:01,676
What's yours?

99
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:02,811
Stewie.

100
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,579
I've never seen you
around here before.

101
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:06,915
I'm new to town and I
don't have many friends.

102
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,316
All right.

103
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:10,952
A lot of pressure on me
instantly, but okay.

104
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,188
Would you like to play with
some of my toys, Stewie?

105
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:14,372
Well, what have you got?

106
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,174
I have a set of jacks,
a paddleball,

107
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:18,043
and this taffy
with superglue.

108
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,178
Isn't that the little
boy who pushed you?

109
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:21,696
Hmm, yes.

110
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:25,433
You there, would you like
a piece of candy?

111
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:38,563
Don't push.

112
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:45,820
Uh, Lois, why do we have
Lucy and Ricky beds?

113
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:48,723
Because I'm sick of you crushing
me in the middle of the night.

114
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,425
Dr. Hartman called
about my X rays.

115
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:52,794
He said my spine
is now disfigured.

116
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:55,196
Lois, if God wanted me
to not sleep with my wife,

117
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:56,798
he would have made me
John Travolta.

118
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:58,199
Peter, I'm really
tired, okay?

119
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:00,101
Just give the bed a try.

120
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:06,691
There you go.

121
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,276
Good night, Peter.

122
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:10,412
I can't sleep like this, Lois.

123
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,147
I need someone to cuddle with.

124
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:14,049
Believe it or not,
men like to cuddle,

125
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:16,918
even cold, unfeeling men
like Charles Bronson.

126
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:19,387
Hey, Charles Bronson's wife.

127
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:22,324
Scooch over.
I want to cuddle.

128
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,492
Mmm, that's nice.

129
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:30,932
I don't know
what the big deal is.

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,401
I stopped for one drink
after work.

131
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:35,203
Yes, but it's
every night.

132
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:38,289
There, now you can be
upset about that.

133
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:39,357
This is fun.

134
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,992
I like playing
with you, Penelope.

135
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,193
What shall
we play next?

136
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:43,912
Well, let's see
what you have.

137
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,898
You have a pop-up version
of the <i>Unabomber's Manifesto?</i>

138
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:50,218
Yes, at the end the brother
pops up and turns you in.

139
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:56,591
What's this
on your Etch A Sketch?

140
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,360
Oh, those are some advanced
mathematical formulas

141
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:00,028
I've just been
tinkering with.

142
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,429
You're kidding?
I do that, too.

143
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:03,698
But what are
these formulas for?

144
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,767
For these.

145
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:14,743
Oh, my God,

146
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,977
you've got a weapons room, too?

147
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:17,178
And look at the size of it.

148
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,546
It's amazing.

149
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:20,782
Yes, although sometimes
I think it's too big.

150
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,284
It takes the cleaning woman
forever to clean it.

151
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:29,257
Was already broken.

152
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,111
My word, Penelope,

153
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,313
you and I seem to have
quite a lot in common.

154
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:39,715
Do you actually
use these?

155
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:42,284
Only when fear, spite, jealousy,
and revenge demand.

156
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,720
I bought that to kill the women
from <i>Sex and the City,</i>

157
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:47,322
but time seems
to be doing it for me.

158
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,158
You're wicked.

159
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,759
Do your parents
have any idea?

160
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,894
My mother's
not a concern.

161
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:53,078
I don't really have
to worry

162
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,430
about her anymore.

163
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,299
Oh, do you have one of those
white wine zombie moms?

164
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,534
No, she died.

165
00:06:58,601 --> 00:06:59,818
She was taking a tub

166
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,187
and somebody came in
and cut her head off.

167
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,622
Wait a moment.

168
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,492
Did... did you kill her?

169
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,429
Well, I held the knife...
and her hair.

170
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,832
Oh, my God, I've been dreaming
about doing that for years,

171
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,868
and you've actually gone ahead
and done it.

172
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,586
Penelope...

173
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:19,354
I've never said this
to anyone before,

174
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:22,858
but I feel like I may have
finally found, in you,

175
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,194
my one true soul mate.

176
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,562
Do you feel this way, too?

177
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,130
I do, Stewart.

178
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,599
It's as if our meeting were
more than a mere coincidence.

179
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,068
It's as if we were
meant to be together.

180
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,336
Indeed.

181
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,905
This must be how Maverick felt
when he met Goose.

182
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:38,473
I feel the need.

183
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,659
The need for speed.
The need for speed.

184
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:42,544
And Scientology.
No, just speed.

185
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:48,167
So, listen, Quagmire,
there's something

186
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,052
I kind of wanted
to talk to you about.

187
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:53,188
E-Ever since Lois got us
twin beds, I can't fall asleep.

188
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:55,090
I'm used to having
another person there.

189
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:57,276
I know. I always sleep better
when I'm next to someone.

190
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,277
Yeah, it's only
natural, right?

191
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,645
I'm glad to hear
you say that

192
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,331
'cause, you know, I guess
what I'm trying to say is,

193
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,300
I... want to propose
an arrangement

194
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,352
that could benefit
the both of us.

195
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,654
Okay.

196
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,923
Men need someone to spoon with
and snuggle with

197
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,661
just the same as women, and when
you don't have that, it-it's...

198
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,646
I... well,
what I'm getting at is...

199
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:22,951
I would like for you
to sleep with me in my bed,

200
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25,354
and this, this is not about sex;
it's about sleep.

201
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,638
No, no, I totally
get it, Peter.

202
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,973
Snuggling is a
basic human need.

203
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,242
Right, I mean, who says
that the body next to you

204
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,910
has to be male or female
or... whatever?

205
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:32,945
Or alive.

206
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,013
Yeah... well, no,
but, yeah.

207
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,481
Look, I, I think
it's a great idea

208
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,749
and I, I'm completely with you.

209
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,084
I'm in. Let's try it.

210
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,553
Yay, that is
such good news.

211
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,505
And I'm so happy
they gave us a booth.

212
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:44,873
I know, 'cause they're
supposed to be reserved

213
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,908
for parties of
three or more.

214
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:47,109
I know!

215
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,015
Oh, Stewie, it's so nice
to finally have someone

216
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:54,416
to do naughty
things with.

217
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:55,517
Definitely.

218
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:56,952
All right, I made
a wallet bomb

219
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,353
and I planted it
on Mort.

220
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,789
As soon
as he opens it-- boom.

221
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,067
Oh, bloody hell.

222
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,586
How do you go two weeks
without opening your wallet?

223
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:16,622
Yeah, he's been out
to dinner, like, four times.

224
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,874
We're clearly not going
to get him this way.

225
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,593
I know, which is why
I just planted another bomb

226
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:24,596
that's set to go off every time
he burps into his hand.

227
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,355
Ohh, I'd better make sure
my wallet's okay.

228
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,846
I say, we're
on quite a run.

229
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,414
We blew up the
Great Wall of China,

230
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,650
bombed the Eiffel Tower, a
look at this note I sent off.

231
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,818
"Dear Pakistan,
Up yours.

232
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,287
Love, India."

233
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,688
Let's see
what happens.

234
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,029
They did not need much.

235
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,331
All right,
Stewie, your turn.

236
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,517
Okay, I have to destroy
Copenhagen with a...

237
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:05,220
tidal wave,
and the theme is...

238
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:06,705
the Roaring Twenties.

239
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,341
Tha-That's, that's,
that's a challenge.

240
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:20,218
Roarin' twenten tidal waven!

241
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,112
Peter, what's
going on?

242
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:31,947
Quagmire's having
a sleepover with me.

243
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,365
You can't
be serious.

244
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,067
Look, Lois, I told you
that I need

245
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,102
to have somebody
sleeping next to me.

246
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,537
All right, now if that's
not going to be you...

247
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,072
Fine. Do what you want.

248
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,290
I don't care,
but I think it's very strange.

249
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,625
Okay, that's the
one thing it's not.

250
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:44,993
Yeah, it's not strange.

251
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,879
I already told you:
I don't care.

252
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,214
It's not strange.

253
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,415
I know.

254
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,550
All right,
let's see here.

255
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,219
Now just, uh, wrap
yourself around me.

256
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,454
Is that okay?

257
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,322
Yeah, actually, you can
hold me even tighter.

258
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,726
Okay, I just need to put
this arm right around here.

259
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,377
Yeah, there we go.

260
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:05,380
Good, now let's just
fall asleep like this.

261
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,717
Your boxers are
a little starchy.

262
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:10,252
Can I take 'em off
with my foot?

263
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,154
Sure.

264
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,277
Come on, you.

265
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:27,269
Good evening.
I'm Tom Tucker.

266
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:29,337
Our top story:
Authorities are still searching

267
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:32,207
for the culprits in a series
of horrific acts of destruction

268
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,443
all across-- scroll down, guys--

269
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,911
the globe.

270
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,212
That could've fit on there.

271
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,014
There was a long space
at the end of that line.

272
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:41,066
My God, it's you,
isn't it?

273
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,350
It's you and Penelope

274
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,019
who've been doing
all of these horrible things.

275
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,537
So? I've always been
about world domination.

276
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,873
What the hell did you think
I was talking about when I said,

277
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,307
"Victory shall be mine"?

278
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,343
You have not said that
in a very long time.

279
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,611
Well, I'm back on it.

280
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,280
Stewie, Penelope is taking you
down a dark path.

281
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,199
Look, in the past
you've done terrible things,

282
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,667
but it's always been
about the pursuit

283
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,635
of your greater goal
of world domination.

284
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:04,272
But this girl-- she just creates
chaos for the sake of chaos.

285
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,407
So, what are you saying?

286
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,042
I'm saying she's
a bad influence on you,

287
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,677
and you should stop spending
time with her.

288
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:09,945
I shall do no such thing.

289
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:11,513
Penelope is wonderful.

290
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:12,981
We're going to be
together forever.

291
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:17,269
Well, Rupert,
this is a big mess.

292
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,321
What the hell were you
doing talking to him?

293
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:26,995
You know who I think
is an ugly slut?

294
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,096
Miss Sharon.

295
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,598
Miss Sharon
from your day care?

296
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,665
Yes.

297
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,434
This is a map of her house.

298
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,802
I thought we could
burn her in her bed

299
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,936
while her children watch.

300
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,371
You know, Penelope,

301
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,174
maybe we don't have
to kill someone every day.

302
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:41,359
There are other things to do.

303
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,277
Like what?

304
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,411
I-I don't know.

305
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,046
You know what? Forget it.

306
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,499
I-I think Brian just got
in my head a bit. That's all.

307
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,667
Brian?

308
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,435
Why? What did Brian say?

309
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,703
Oh, nothing.

310
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,072
He just thinks that you're
a bad influence on me.

311
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,074
T-Thinks I should stop
seeing you.

312
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,375
He does?

313
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,294
How dare he!

314
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,529
Babe? Babe?

315
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:01,796
Don't worry about it,
all right?

316
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,149
Stewart, do you love me?

317
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,684
More than anything.

318
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,019
Then swear on that love
that you'll do what I ask.

319
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,221
Just name it.

320
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,889
Kill him.

321
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,591
Kill Brian for me.

322

He's my dog, my friend.

You're fired.

353
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:16,439
But I was only having a child

354
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:17,874
because you
and the mister...

355
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:22,011
You don't get to speak
of me and the mister!

356
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,263
Ah, Stewie.
So did you do it?

357
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:27,133
Have you removed that wretched
cur from our existence?

358
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:29,736
I just couldn't bring myself
to kill him, Penelope.

359
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,038
Brian is my best friend.

360
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:33,606
Perhaps you're right.

361
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:35,808
Perhaps it was wrong of me
to ask you to do such a thing.

362
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,377
Oh, thank you.

363
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:39,712
I'm so glad you're being
so understanding about this.

364
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,281
I was actually dreading
having to tell you about this.

365
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:43,883
Bleah.

366
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:46,319
It appears I'll have
to kill him myself.

367
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:47,453
What?!

368
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,455
I knew you were too weak
to do this.

369
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:50,923
You're nothing but a coward.

370
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,775
No, Penelope, wait!

371
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:55,228
Strong women always
turn out to be nightmares.

372
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:56,929
Like Joan of Arc.

373
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,499
Hey, guys,
I'm not like other girls.

374
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:02,101
I kill people and burp
and watch so much porn.

375
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,003
Isn't that cool?
No.

376
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:05,705
I like a lot
of goofball comedies

377
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:07,440
that other chicks don't like.

378
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,976
My favorite thing to play
is <i>Call of Duty.</i>

379
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:13,112
Look me up.
I'm GuitarGurrrl76.

380
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,680
Let's burn this chick
at the stake.

381
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:15,948
I love steak!

382
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,116
Other girls don't.

383
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,785
I'm actually more like a dude.

384
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,370
Hey, guys,
don't come in my room.

385
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:22,805
I might be rubbin' one in.

386
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:28,194
Peter, this is ridiculous.

387
00:16:28,262 --> 00:16:29,962
It's time for you
to come home.

388
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,464
I live here now, Lois.

389
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,033
Look, I'm sorry
that I ever got us separate...

390
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:35,468
Is that a bracelet
you're wearing?

391
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:36,919
It's a giggity band, Lois.

392
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:38,388
You wouldn't understand.

393
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,989
Look, Peter,
if you come home now,

394
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,491
we can get our old bed back,

395
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:43,459
and you can snuge with me
as much as you want.

396
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:44,894
Well...

397
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,696
You promise?

398
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:48,164
I promise.

399
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:51,534
'Cause, you know,
I missed cuddling with you, too.

400
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:52,535
You did?

401
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:54,437
I sure did.

402
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:56,689
Well, then, hey...

403
00:16:56,757 --> 00:16:59,108
what do you say we go home, huh?

404
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:01,277
Sounds good to me.

405
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,970
Oh, Brian, there you are!

406
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:12,205
Thank God.
Oh, hey, Stewie.

407
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:13,539
Did you make that coffee?

408
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,208
Um, no, it was here
when I came in.

409
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,343
I assume Lois made it.
Don't drink that!

410
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,612
Hey, that mug was my crew
gift from "Class Holes."

411
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,280
Did you take a bite
out of this donut?

412
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:22,949
Yeah, it was from a
box on the counter.

413
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,217
So what?
How long ago?

414
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,351
I don't know. Five minutes?

415
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,669
There's still time.

416
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:33,626
God, Stewie, are you
out of your mind?

417
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,762
Trust me, I'm only doing
what's best for you.

418
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:38,381
Well, I do feel pretty
thin and wonderful.

419
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:39,982
And I still got
to eat the donut.

420
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,400
Why isn't everybody
doing this?

421
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:43,119
They are.

422
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:47,123
I've got a package here
for Brian Griffin.

423
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,207
Oh, that's me.

424
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,709
Brian, no!

425
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,614
Stewie, what the hell
is going on?

426
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:56,349
I'm so sorry, Brian.

427
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,267
Penelope told me
I had to kill you

428
00:17:58,352 --> 00:17:59,752
because you said
we should break up,

429
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,420
but I couldn't bring myself
to do it.

430
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:03,823
So then she said
she was gonna kill you and...

431
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:06,325
This-this is not for you.

432
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:08,628
That was weird.

433
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:09,796
W-What was he doing?

434
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:11,514
Anyway, Penelope's
trying to kill you!

435
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:13,249
I told you she was bad news.

436
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:14,917
Look, let's just get you
someplace safe.

437
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,570
Dude, get out of here.

438
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:23,209
Stewie, step aside.

439
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:25,161
Penelope,
I can't let you do this.

440
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,529
Stewie, she's
one year old.

441
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:27,847
I think I can
handle this myself.

442
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:33,753
All right, Stewie, tag in.

443
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:45,198
Slo-o-w mo-o-o-tion
di-i-ving at yo-o-u!

444
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:05,985
Anti-gravity gun!

445
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:07,853
This is beyond my technology.

446
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:09,789
Perhaps if I detonate
an electromagnetic pulse,

447
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:10,856
it will disable it.

448
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:06,596
Stay away from my dog.

449
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,714
Very well, Stewie. I shall.

450
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:10,349
But just one thing.

451
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,300
What?

452
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:34,740
That was...

453
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:36,475
beautiful.

454
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:38,744
I'm gonna tell my friends
I banged her.

455
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:42,812
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

456
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,085
Hey, thanks for
saving my life.

457
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:47,737
Well, it was the least
I could do.

458
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:50,556
Obviously, it turns out
you were right about Penelope.

459
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,757
You okay?

460
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:53,025
I will be.

461
00:20:53,093 --> 00:20:54,360
I will be, babe.

462
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:55,528
Oh, hey, Meg.

463
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:56,679
What have you been up to?
