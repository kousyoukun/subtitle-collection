12
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,310
Come on, Stewie. Hurry up.
I want to get good seats.

13
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:42,129
Ugh, I hate going to hear
authors read from their work.

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,265
That Dr. Seuss reading
was dreadful.

15
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,500
And when the drugs
stopped numbing the pain,

16
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,502
the sex became
even more violent.

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,670
It doesn't rhyme.

18
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:51,539
The new stuff
doesn't rhyme!

19
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:54,475
Hey, there.

20
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:56,611
You a big fan
of Jonathan Franzen?

21
00:00:56,678 --> 00:00:58,829
Oh, my God,
I worship him.

22
00:00:58,897 --> 00:01:00,464
Yeah, yeah, of all
my writing students,

23
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:01,999
he's probably
done the best.

24
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:03,367
I'm sorry,
everybody.

25
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:06,103
Mr. Franzen has informed us
he's not coming.

26
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:09,407
Like most real authors, he's
too good for this dumb town.

27
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:12,176
I hate it here.

28
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:14,045
Well, this crowd
was promised an author.

29
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:16,030
No!

30
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:18,215
Oh, well, you know, I guess
I should be getting back

31
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,350
to my dorm anyway.

32
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:20,484
I've got a short story due

33
00:01:20,552 --> 00:01:22,136
for my creative writing
class tomorrow.

34
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:23,738
Oh, creative
writing, huh?

35
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,973
Well, if you'd like me to look
it over before you turn it in,

36
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,525
I'd be happy to.
Really?

37
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:29,009
That'd be great.

38
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:30,645
Cool, cool,
I'll follow you in my car.

39
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:31,679
Come on. We're going.

40
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:33,281
All right,
hold on.

41
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:35,516
Is this what your parents are
paying all that tuition for--

42
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,385
so you can
 dogs?

43
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:47,478
I'll print up for you
what I have so far.

44
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:48,713
Okay, I'm gonna go
in there with her.

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,364
You just sit out here
and be quiet.

46
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:52,166
Here, watch one of her
movies or something.

47
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:56,153
Ugh, <i>Charlie St. Cloud?</i>

48
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:58,089
A-And why are there
so many fingerprints on this?

49
00:01:58,156 --> 00:02:02,226
Who's handling their <i>Charlie</i>
<i>St. Cloud</i> DVD all the time?

50
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:14,956
Lois, can I have
a Pop-Tart in bed, please?

51
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:16,691
Lois?

52
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:17,725
Hey, Chris?

53
00:02:17,793 --> 00:02:19,260
Yeah?

54
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:21,946
Do you think Lois would be okay
if I ate a Pop-Tart in bed?

55
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:22,980
Probably.

56
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:24,148
Probably, right?

57
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:26,334
Lois, you in the bathroom?

58
00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:35,059
Well, Mrs. Griffin,
you have three crushed ribs,

59
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:36,978
but I was able to stop
the internal bleeding.

60
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:39,814
Doctor, this has happened
seven times in the last month.

61
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:42,583
Peter rolls over in his sleep
and almost kills me.

62
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:43,851
I see.

63
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,885
Well, that sucks.

64
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:46,387
Look, I don't do it
on purpose.

65
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:48,255
Well, it looks like you got
a handle on it then.

66
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:49,473
No, we don't.

67
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,342
He practically
smothers me every night.

68
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,743
Well, are you hogging
the blankets?

69
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:53,944
No.

70
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:55,696
"Probably hogging
blankets."

71
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:58,149
And if he's not smothering me,
he's keeping me up all night

72
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,885
writing with that
giant plume of his.

73
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:04,605
"Dearest Augustine,
I do hope this latest damp

74
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:06,123
has not aggravated
your gray lung."

75
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,758
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

76
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:10,077
"Matters stateside
have taken a tragic turn

77
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:12,129
"as this year's gourd crop
has fallen prey

78
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:14,048
"to a rather
unexpected infestation

79
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:15,416
of saltmarsh cutworms."

80
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:16,600
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

81
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:18,219
Peter, it's 4:00
in the morning.

82
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:19,720
Come to bed!

83
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:22,490
"Marital concerns continue
to bedevil me."

84
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,445
Look, I'm sorry.

85
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:30,047
I wasn't planning on
spending all night there.

86
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:32,650
Look, how about if I take
you to the park, huh?

87
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:35,486
Come on. You like
the park, right?

88
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:37,805
We're about to
pass the turnoff.

89
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:40,741
Here it comes.

90
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:42,727
You may take me
to the park.

91
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:49,934
Um, excuse me. I didn't
bring any of my toys.

92
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:51,302
Can I play with
some of yours?

93
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,220
No! Mine!

94
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,108
Are you all right?

95
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,409
I'm fine.

96
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:00,828
I-I didn't push him back
because he has leukemia.

97
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,896
My name's Penelope.

98
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:02,863
What's yours?

99
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:03,998
Stewie.

100
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:05,766
I've never seen you
around here before.

101
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,102
I'm new to town and I
don't have many friends.

102
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,503
All right.

103
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:12,139
A lot of pressure on me
instantly, but okay.

104
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,375
Would you like to play with
some of my toys, Stewie?

105
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:15,559
Well, what have you got?

106
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:17,361
I have a set of jacks,
a paddleball,

107
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:19,230
and this taffy
with superglue.

108
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:21,365
Isn't that the little
boy who pushed you?

109
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,883
Hmm, yes.

110
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:26,620
You there, would you like
a piece of candy?

111
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:39,750
Don't push.

112
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:47,007
Uh, Lois, why do we have
Lucy and Ricky beds?

113
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:49,910
Because I'm sick of you crushing
me in the middle of the night.

114
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:51,612
Dr. Hartman called
about my X rays.

115
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,981
He said my spine
is now disfigured.

116
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:56,383
Lois, if God wanted me
to not sleep with my wife,

117
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:57,985
he would have made me
John Travolta.

118
00:04:58,053 --> 00:04:59,386
Peter, I'm really
tired, okay?

119
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,288
Just give the bed a try.

120
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:07,878
There you go.

121
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:09,463
Good night, Peter.

122
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:11,599
I can't sleep like this, Lois.

123
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,334
I need someone to cuddle with.

124
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,236
Believe it or not,
men like to cuddle,

125
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:18,105
even cold, unfeeling men
like Charles Bronson.

126
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:20,574
Hey, Charles Bronson's wife.

127
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:23,511
Scooch over.
I want to cuddle.

128
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:25,679
Mmm, that's nice.

129
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:32,119
I don't know
what the big deal is.

130
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,588
I stopped for one drink
after work.

131
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:36,390
Yes, but it's
every night.

132
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,476
There, now you can be
upset about that.

133
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:40,544
This is fun.

134
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:42,179
I like playing
with you, Penelope.

135
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:43,380
What shall
we play next?

136
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:45,099
Well, let's see
what you have.

137
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:48,085
You have a pop-up version
of the <i>Unabomber's Manifesto?</i>

138
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:51,405
Yes, at the end the brother
pops up and turns you in.

139
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,778
What's this
on your Etch A Sketch?

140
00:05:57,846 --> 00:05:59,547
Oh, those are some advanced
mathematical formulas

141
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:01,215
I've just been
tinkering with.

142
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:02,616
You're kidding?
I do that, too.

143
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:04,885
But what are
these formulas for?

144
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,954
For these.

145
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,930
Oh, my God,

146
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:17,164
you've got a weapons room, too?

147
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:18,365
And look at the size of it.

148
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:19,733
It's amazing.

149
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,969
Yes, although sometimes
I think it's too big.

150
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:24,471
It takes the cleaning woman
forever to clean it.

151
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,444
Was already broken.

152
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:39,252
My word, Penelope,

153
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,454
you and I seem to have
quite a lot in common.

154
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,856
Do you actually
use these?

155
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,425
Only when fear, spite, jealousy,
and revenge demand.

156
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,861
I bought that to kill the women
from <i>Sex and the City,</i>

157
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,463
but time seems
to be doing it for me.

158
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,299
You're wicked.

159
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:53,900
Do your parents
have any idea?

160
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:55,035
My mother's
not a concern.

161
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:56,219
I don't really have
to worry

162
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:57,571
about her anymore.

163
00:06:57,638 --> 00:07:00,440
Oh, do you have one of those
white wine zombie moms?

164
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:01,675
No, she died.

165
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:02,959
She was taking a tub

166
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:05,328
and somebody came in
and cut her head off.

167
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:06,763
Wait a moment.

168
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,633
Did... did you kill her?

169
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,570
Well, I held the knife...
and her hair.

170
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:16,973
Oh, my God, I've been dreaming
about doing that for years,

171
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,009
and you've actually gone ahead
and done it.

172
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:20,727
Penelope...

173
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,495
I've never said this
to anyone before,

174
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:25,999
but I feel like I may have
finally found, in you,

175
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:28,335
my one true soul mate.

176
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:29,703
Do you feel this way, too?

177
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,271
I do, Stewart.

178
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:33,740
It's as if our meeting were
more than a mere coincidence.

179
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:36,209
It's as if we were
meant to be together.

180
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:37,477
Indeed.

181
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:40,046
This must be how Maverick felt
when he met Goose.

182
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,614
I feel the need.

183
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,800
The need for speed.
The need for speed.

184
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:45,685
And Scientology.
No, just speed.

185
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:51,308
So, listen, Quagmire,
there's something

186
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:53,193
I kind of wanted
to talk to you about.

187
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,329
E-Ever since Lois got us
twin beds, I can't fall asleep.

188
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:58,231
I'm used to having
another person there.

189
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,417
I know. I always sleep better
when I'm next to someone.

190
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:01,418
Yeah, it's only
natural, right?

191
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,786
I'm glad to hear
you say that

192
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:05,472
'cause, you know, I guess
what I'm trying to say is,

193
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:08,441
I... want to propose
an arrangement

194
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,493
that could benefit
the both of us.

195
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:11,795
Okay.

196
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:14,064
Men need someone to spoon with
and snuggle with

197
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:18,802
just the same as women, and when
you don't have that, it-it's...

198
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,787
I... well,
what I'm getting at is...

199
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:26,092
I would like for you
to sleep with me in my bed,

200
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,495
and this, this is not about sex;
it's about sleep.

201
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:29,779
No, no, I totally
get it, Peter.

202
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:31,114
Snuggling is a
basic human need.

203
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:33,383
Right, I mean, who says
that the body next to you

204
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,051
has to be male or female
or... whatever?

205
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,086
Or alive.

206
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:38,154
Yeah... well, no,
but, yeah.

207
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:39,622
Look, I, I think
it's a great idea

208
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,890
and I, I'm completely with you.

209
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,225
I'm in. Let's try it.

210
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:44,694
Yay, that is
such good news.

211
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:46,646
And I'm so happy
they gave us a booth.

212
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:48,014
I know, 'cause they're
supposed to be reserved

213
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:49,049
for parties of
three or more.

214
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:50,250
I know!

215
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:56,156
Oh, Stewie, it's so nice
to finally have someone

216
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:57,557
to do naughty
things with.

217
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,658
Definitely.

218
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:00,093
All right, I made
a wallet bomb

219
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:01,494
and I planted it
on Mort.

220
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,930
As soon
as he opens it-- boom.

221
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:15,208
Oh, bloody hell.

222
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:17,727
How do you go two weeks
without opening your wallet?

223
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:19,763
Yeah, he's been out
to dinner, like, four times.

224
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:22,015
We're clearly not going
to get him this way.

225
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,734
I know, which is why
I just planted another bomb

226
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:27,737
that's set to go off every time
he burps into his hand.

227
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:36,496
Ohh, I'd better make sure
my wallet's okay.

228
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,987
I say, we're
on quite a run.

229
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:45,555
We blew up the
Great Wall of China,

230
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:47,791
bombed the Eiffel Tower, a
look at this note I sent off.

231
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,959
"Dear Pakistan,
Up yours.

232
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:51,428
Love, India."

233
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:52,829
Let's see
what happens.

234
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:00,170
They did not need much.

235
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:02,472
All right,
Stewie, your turn.

236
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,658
Okay, I have to destroy
Copenhagen with a...

237
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:08,361
tidal wave,
and the theme is...

238
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:09,846
the Roaring Twenties.

239
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:12,482
Tha-That's, that's,
that's a challenge.

240
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,359
Roarin' twenten tidal waven!

241
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,253
Peter, what's
going on?

242
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,088
Quagmire's having
a sleepover with me.

243
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,506
You can't
be serious.

244
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:38,208
Look, Lois, I told you
that I need

245
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,243
to have somebody
sleeping next to me.

246
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:41,678
All right, now if that's
not going to be you...

247
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:43,213
Fine. Do what you want.

248
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,431
I don't care,
but I think it's very strange.

249
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:46,766
Okay, that's the
one thing it's not.

250
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,134
Yeah, it's not strange.

251
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:51,020
I already told you:
I don't care.

252
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:52,355
It's not strange.

253
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:53,556
I know.

254
00:10:53,624 --> 00:10:54,691
All right,
let's see here.

255
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:57,360
Now just, uh, wrap
yourself around me.

256
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:58,595
Is that okay?

257
00:10:58,662 --> 00:11:00,463
Yeah, actually, you can
hold me even tighter.

258
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:03,867
Okay, I just need to put
this arm right around here.

259
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,518
Yeah, there we go.

260
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:08,521
Good, now let's just
fall asleep like this.

261
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,858
Your boxers are
a little starchy.

262
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:13,393
Can I take 'em off
with my foot?

263
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,295
Sure.

264
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:22,418
Come on, you.

265
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:30,410
Good evening.
I'm Tom Tucker.

266
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:32,478
Our top story:
Authorities are still searching

267
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:35,348
for the culprits in a series
of horrific acts of destruction

268
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,584
all across-- scroll down, guys--

269
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:39,052
the globe.

270
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,353
That could've fit on there.

271
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:42,155
There was a long space
at the end of that line.

272
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:44,207
My God, it's you,
isn't it?

273
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,491
It's you and Penelope

274
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:47,160
who've been doing
all of these horrible things.

275
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:48,678
So? I've always been
about world domination.

276
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:51,014
What the hell did you think
I was talking about when I said,

277
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:52,448
"Victory shall be mine"?

278
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:54,484
You have not said that
in a very long time.

279
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:55,752
Well, I'm back on it.

280
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,421
Stewie, Penelope is taking you
down a dark path.

281
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:00,340
Look, in the past
you've done terrible things,

282
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:01,808
but it's always been
about the pursuit

283
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:03,776
of your greater goal
of world domination.

284
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:07,413
But this girl-- she just creates
chaos for the sake of chaos.

285
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:08,548
So, what are you saying?

286
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:10,183
I'm saying she's
a bad influence on you,

287
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,818
and you should stop spending
time with her.

288
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:13,086
I shall do no such thing.

289
00:12:13,153 --> 00:12:14,654
Penelope is wonderful.

290
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:16,122
We're going to be
together forever.

291
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:20,410
Well, Rupert,
this is a big mess.

292
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:22,462
What the hell were you
doing talking to him?

293
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:30,136
You know who I think
is an ugly slut?

294
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:31,237
Miss Sharon.

295
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:32,739
Miss Sharon
from your day care?

296
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:33,806
Yes.

297
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:35,575
This is a map of her house.

298
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:36,943
I thought we could
burn her in her bed

299
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,077
while her children watch.

300
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:39,512
You know, Penelope,

301
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,315
maybe we don't have
to kill someone every day.

302
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:44,500
There are other things to do.

303
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:45,418
Like what?

304
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:46,552
I-I don't know.

305
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,187
You know what? Forget it.

306
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,640
I-I think Brian just got
in my head a bit. That's all.

307
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,808
Brian?

308
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,576
Why? What did Brian say?

309
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:54,844
Oh, nothing.

310
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:57,213
He just thinks that you're
a bad influence on me.

311
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:59,215
T-Thinks I should stop
seeing you.

312
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:00,516
He does?

313
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:02,435
How dare he!

314
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:03,670
Babe? Babe?

315
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:04,937
Don't worry about it,
all right?

316
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:07,290
Stewart, do you love me?

317
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:08,825
More than anything.

318
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:11,160
Then swear on that love
that you'll do what I ask.

319
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:12,362
Just name it.

320
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:14,030
Kill him.

321
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:15,732
Kill Brian for me.

He's my dog, my friend.

331

You're fired.

353
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,471
But I was only having a child

354
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:22,906
because you
and the mister...

355
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:27,043
You don't get to speak
of me and the mister!

356
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:29,295
Ah, Stewie.
So did you do it?

357
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:32,165
Have you removed that wretched
cur from our existence?

358
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:34,768
I just couldn't bring myself
to kill him, Penelope.

359
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:37,070
Brian is my best friend.

360
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:38,638
Perhaps you're right.

361
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,840
Perhaps it was wrong of me
to ask you to do such a thing.

362
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,409
Oh, thank you.

363
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,744
I'm so glad you're being
so understanding about this.

364
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:47,313
I was actually dreading
having to tell you about this.

365
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:48,915
Bleah.

366
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:51,351
It appears I'll have
to kill him myself.

367
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,485
What?!

368
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,487
I knew you were too weak
to do this.

369
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:55,955
You're nothing but a coward.

370
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,807
No, Penelope, wait!

371
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,260
Strong women always
turn out to be nightmares.

372
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,961
Like Joan of Arc.

373
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,531
Hey, guys,
I'm not like other girls.

374
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:07,133
I kill people and burp
and watch so much porn.

375
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:09,035
Isn't that cool?
No.

376
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:10,737
I like a lot
of goofball comedies

377
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,472
that other chicks don't like.

378
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,008
My favorite thing to play
is <i>Call of Duty.</i>

379
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:18,144
Look me up.
I'm GuitarGurrrl76.

380
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,712
Let's burn this chick
at the stake.

381
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:20,980
I love steak!

382
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,148
Other girls don't.

383
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:23,817
I'm actually more like a dude.

384
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:25,402
Hey, guys,
don't come in my room.

385
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:27,837
I might be rubbin' one in.

386
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:33,226
Peter, this is ridiculous.

387
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:34,994
It's time for you
to come home.

388
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,496
I live here now, Lois.

389
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:39,065
Look, I'm sorry
that I ever got us separate...

390
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,500
Is that a bracelet
you're wearing?

391
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,951
It's a giggity band, Lois.

392
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,420
You wouldn't understand.

393
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:45,021
Look, Peter,
if you come home now,

394
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,523
we can get our old bed back,

395
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,491
and you can snuge with me
as much as you want.

396
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,926
Well...

397
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:51,728
You promise?

398
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:53,196
I promise.

399
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:56,566
'Cause, you know,
I missed cuddling with you, too.

400
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:57,567
You did?

401
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:59,469
I sure did.

402
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:01,721
Well, then, hey...

403
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,140
what do you say we go home, huh?

404
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,309
Sounds good to me.

405
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,002
Oh, Brian, there you are!

406
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,237
Thank God.
Oh, hey, Stewie.

407
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:18,571
Did you make that coffee?

408
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,240
Um, no, it was here
when I came in.

409
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,375
I assume Lois made it.
Don't drink that!

410
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:24,644
Hey, that mug was my crew
gift from "Class Holes."

411
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,312
Did you take a bite
out of this donut?

412
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,981
Yeah, it was from a
box on the counter.

413
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,249
So what?
How long ago?

414
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,383
I don't know. Five minutes?

415
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:31,701
There's still time.

416
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,658
God, Stewie, are you
out of your mind?

417
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,794
Trust me, I'm only doing
what's best for you.

418
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,413
Well, I do feel pretty
thin and wonderful.

419
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,014
And I still got
to eat the donut.

420
00:17:45,082 --> 00:17:46,432
Why isn't everybody
doing this?

421
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,151
They are.

422
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,155
I've got a package here
for Brian Griffin.

423
00:17:52,223 --> 00:17:53,239
Oh, that's me.

424
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:54,741
Brian, no!

425
00:17:57,895 --> 00:17:59,646
Stewie, what the hell
is going on?

426
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,381
I'm so sorry, Brian.

427
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,299
Penelope told me
I had to kill you

428
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:04,784
because you said
we should break up,

429
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:06,452
but I couldn't bring myself
to do it.

430
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,855
So then she said
she was gonna kill you and...

431
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:11,357
This-this is not for you.

432
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,660
That was weird.

433
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:14,828
W-What was he doing?

434
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,546
Anyway, Penelope's
trying to kill you!

435
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:18,281
I told you she was bad news.

436
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:19,949
Look, let's just get you
someplace safe.

437
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:22,602
Dude, get out of here.

438
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,241
Stewie, step aside.

439
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,193
Penelope,
I can't let you do this.

440
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:31,561
Stewie, she's
one year old.

441
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:32,879
I think I can
handle this myself.

442
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,785
All right, Stewie, tag in.

443
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:50,230
Slo-o-w mo-o-o-tion
di-i-ving at yo-o-u!

444
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:11,017
Anti-gravity gun!

445
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,885
This is beyond my technology.

446
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:14,821
Perhaps if I detonate
an electromagnetic pulse,

447
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:15,888
it will disable it.

448
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,628
Stay away from my dog.

449
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,746
Very well, Stewie. I shall.

450
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,381
But just one thing.

451
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:16,332
What?

452
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:39,772
That was...

453
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,507
beautiful.

454
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,776
I'm gonna tell my friends
I banged her.

455
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:47,844
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

456
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,117
Hey, thanks for
saving my life.

457
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,769
Well, it was the least
I could do.

458
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,588
Obviously, it turns out
you were right about Penelope.

459
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:56,789
You okay?

460
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,057
I will be.

461
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,392
I will be, babe.

462
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,560
Oh, hey, Meg.

463
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:01,711
What have you been up to?
