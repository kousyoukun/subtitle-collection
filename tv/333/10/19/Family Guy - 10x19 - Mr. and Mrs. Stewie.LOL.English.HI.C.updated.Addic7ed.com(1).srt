这样 现在你又能对那个伤心了
There, now you can be upset about that.

138
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:40,544

This is fun.

139
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:42,179
我喜欢和你一起玩儿 Penelope
I like playing with you, Penelope.

140
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:43,380
我们接下来玩什么
What shall we play next?

141
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:45,099
那先让我看看你有什么
Well, let's see what you have.

142
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:48,085
你有本"炸弹客宣言"的立体书版本?
You have a pop-up version of the <i>Unabomber's Manifesto?</i>

143
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:48,085
炸弹客是Ted Kaczynski一个邮寄炸弹的恐怖分子
他的宣言"工业社会和他的未来"后来被出版

144
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:51,405
是的 在最后弟弟会弹出来然后把你供出去
Yes, at the end the brother pops up and turns you in.

145
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:51,405
这就炸弹客被捕的原因

146
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,778
你的神奇画板上面是什么
What's this on your Etch A Sketch?

147
00:05:57,846 --> 00:05:59,547
噢 那些是高级数学方程
Oh, those are some advanced mathematical formulas

148
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:01,215
我刚刚思考它们来着
I've just been tinkering with.

149
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:02,616
你开玩笑么 我也这么干的
You're kidding? I do that, too.

150
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:04,885
但这些方程是干什么用的
But what are these formulas for?

151
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,954
干这个
For these.

152
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,930
天哪
Oh, my God,

153
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:17,164
你也有个武器库?
you've got a weapons room, too?

154
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:18,365
看看它的大小啊
And look at the size of it.

155
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:19,733
太赞了
It's amazing.

156
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,969
是啊 虽然有时候我觉得太大了点
Yes, although sometimes I think it's too big.

157
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:24,471
让那个清洁大妈一直打扫不完
It takes the cleaning woman forever to clean it.

158
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,444
这个早就坏掉了
Was already broken.

159
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:39,252
我说 Penelope
My word, Penelope,

160
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,454
你和我看起来有很多共同点
you and I seem to have quite a lot in common.

161
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,856
这些东西你也用么
Do you actually use these?

162
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,425
仅当恐惧 恶意 嫉妒和复仇时才用
Only when fear, spite, jealousy, and revenge demand.

163
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,861
我买它们是为了杀掉《欲望都市》里的几个大妈
I bought that to kill the women from <i>Sex and the City,</i>

164
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,463
但看起来时间已经帮我解决她们了
but time seems to be doing it for me.

165
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,299
你好邪恶哟
You're wicked.

166
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:53,900
你父母没什么想法么
Do your parents have any idea?

167
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:55,035
我妈已经不在考虑范围内了
My mother's not a concern.

168
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:57,571
我其实再也不用担心她了
I don't really have to worry about her anymore.

169
00:06:57,638 --> 00:07:00,440
噢 难道你有个白酒僵尸老妈
Oh, do you have one of those white wine zombie moms?

170
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:01,675
不 她死了
No, she died.

171
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:02,959
她在浴缸里洗澡时
She was taking a tub

172
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:05,328
有人进去割掉了她的脑袋
and somebody came in and cut her head off.

173
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:06,763
等一会
Wait a moment.

174
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,633
是…是你杀了她?
Did... did you kill her?

175
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,570
其实 是我握的刀…还有她的头发
Well, I held the knife... and her hair.

176
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:16,973
天哪 我这些年来一直想这么干
Oh, my God, I've been dreaming about doing that for years,

177
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,009
而你却已经付诸于行动了
and you've actually gone ahead and done it.

178
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:20,727
Penelope...

179
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,495
我从来没对人这么说过
I've never said this to anyone before,

180
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:25,999
但我觉得我应该在你身上找到了 
but I feel like I may have finally found, in you,

181
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:28,335
我的终身伴侣
my one true soul mate.

182
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:29,703
你也是这么觉得么
Do you feel this way, too?

183
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,271
是的 Stewart
I do, Stewart.

184
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:33,740
那这么说来我们的想与就不是一个巧合了
It's as if our meeting were more than a mere coincidence.

185
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:36,209
是因为我们命中注定要在一起
It's as if we were meant to be together.

186
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:37,477
确实
Indeed.

187
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:40,046
Maverick对Goose的感觉也一定是这样的
This must be how Maverick felt when he met Goose.

188
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:40,046
汤姆克鲁斯的《壮志凌云》

189
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,614
我收到了感召
I feel the need.

190
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,800
速度的感召 速度的感召
The need for speed.The need for speed.

191
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:45,685
还有山达基教 不 只有速度
And Scientology. No, just speed.

192
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:51,308
听好 Quagmire 我有些事
So, listen, Quagmire, there's something

193
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:53,193
想要和你谈谈
I kind of wanted to talk to you about.

194
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,329
自从Lois让我们分了床 我就一直睡不着
E-Ever since Lois got us twin beds, I can't fall asleep.

195
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:58,231
我习惯有一个人在我身边
I'm used to having another person there.

196
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,417
我知道 我身边有认识我也会睡得更香
I know. I always sleep better when I'm next to someone.

197
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:01,418
是啊 这很正常 对么
Yeah, it's only natural, right?

198
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,786
我很高兴听到你这么说
I'm glad to hear you say that

199
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:05,472
因为 我想告诉你的是
'cause, you know, I guess what I'm trying to say is,

200
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:08,441
我…要提一个请求
I... want to propose an arrangement

201
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,493
能让我们互惠互利
that could benefit the both of us.

202
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:11,795
好的
Okay.

203
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:14,064
男人也需要有人来给他们搂抱依偎
Men need someone to spoon with and snuggle with

204
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:18,802
和女人也是一样 而且当你没有这么做时 就-就会…
just the same as women, and when you don't have that, it-it's...

205
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,787
我…呃 我想说的是…
I... well, what I'm getting at is...

206
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:26,092
我希望你可以和我相拥而眠
I would like for you to sleep with me in my bed,

207
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,495
而且这 这和性没有关系 就死睡觉而已
and this, this is not about sex; it's about sleep.

208
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:29,779
不不 我完全明白 Peter
No, no, I totally get it, Peter.

209
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:31,114
依偎是人类的基本需要
Snuggling is a basic human need.

210
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:33,383
是的 我是说 谁规定在你身边的那个人
Right, I mean, who says that the body next to you

211
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,051
一定要是个男的或者女的 或者别的什么呢
has to be male or female or... whatever?

212
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,086
或者是活的
Or alive.

213
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:38,154
是啊… 呃 不是 但是 是啊
Yeah... well, no, but, yeah.

214
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:39,622
听着 我-我觉得这是个好主意
Look, I, I think it's a great idea

215
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,890
我完全同意你
and I, I'm completely with you.

216
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,225
我同意了 我们开始吧
I'm in. Let's try it.

217
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:44,694
耶 真是个天大的好消息
Yay, that is such good news.

218
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:46,646
他们给我们一个小房间我真是太开心了
And I'm so happy they gave us a booth.

219
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:48,014
是啊 因为他们本来是被预定了
I know, 'cause they're supposed to be reserved

220
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:49,049
要开3个或者更多的派对的
for parties of three or more.

221
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:50,250
是呀
I know!

222
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:56,156
噢 Stewie 我真高兴终于能找到一个人
Oh, Stewie, it's so nice to finally have someone

223
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:57,557
和我一起干坏事了
to do naughty things with.

224
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,658
绝对的
Definitely.

225
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:00,093
好了 我做了一个钱包炸弹
All right, I made a wallet bomb

226
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:01,494
放在了Mort身上
and I planted it on Mort.

227
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,930
只要他一打开-- 嘣
As soon as he opens it-- boom.

228
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:15,208
噢 见鬼了
Oh, bloody hell.

229
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:17,727
你怎么能2周都不打开钱包呢
How do you go two weeks without opening your wallet?

230
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:19,763
是啊 他还去外面吃饭 好像有4次了
Yeah, he's been out to dinner, like, four times.

231
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:22,015
我们显然这样搞不定他
We're clearly not going to get him this way.

232
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,734
是啊 所以我就设置了另一个炸弹
I know, which is why I just planted another bomb

233
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:27,737
只要他每次往他拳头上打嗝就会引爆
that's set to go off every time he burps into his hand.

234
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:36,496
噢 我最好检查下我的钱包没事
Ohh, I'd better make sure my wallet's okay.

235
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,987
我说 我们真是太给力了
I say, we're on quite a run.

236
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:45,555
我们炸掉了中国长城
We blew up the Great Wall of China,

237
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:47,791
炸掉了埃菲尔铁塔 看看我刚发出去的信息
bombed the Eiffel Tower, a look at this note I sent off.

238
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,959
"亲爱的巴基斯坦 去屎吧
"Dear Pakistan, Up yours.

239
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:51,428
爱你的 印度"
Love, India."

240
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:52,829
让我们来欣赏一下
Let's see what happens.

241
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:00,170
他们其实不需要这么多的
They did not need much.

242
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:02,472
好了 Stewie 该你了
All right, Stewie, your turn.

243
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,658
好 我得毁灭哥本哈根(丹麦首府)用
Okay, I have to destroy Copenhagen with a...

244
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:08,361
一次海啸 然后主题是…
tidal wave, and the theme is...

245
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:09,846
咆哮的二十年代
the Roaring Twenties.

246
00:10:09,846 --> 00:10:09,846
指第一次世界大战后美国1920-1930的爵士乐时代

247
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:12,482
这-这 这 这可有点挑战性啊
Tha-That's, that's, that's a challenge.

248
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:20,373
当时流行的一种交谊舞(查尔斯顿舞)的曲调

249
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,359
爵士乐时代海啸来啦
Roarin' twenten tidal waven!

250
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,253
Peter 怎么回事
Peter, what's going on?

251
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,088
Quagmire今晚和我一起过夜
Quagmire's having a sleepover with me.

252
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,506
你开玩笑的吧
You can't be serious.

253
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:38,208
Lois 我告诉过你我需要
Look, Lois, I told you that I need

254
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,243
有人和我睡在一起
to have somebody sleeping next to me.

255
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:41,678
好吧 现在如果不是你…
All right, now if that's not going to be you...

256
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:43,213
算了 随你的便吧
Fine. Do what you want.

257
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,431
我无所谓 但我觉得这很怪
I don't care, but I think it's very strange.

258
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:46,766
好了 这一点也不怪
Okay, that's the one thing it's not.

259
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,134
是的 不怪
Yeah, it's not strange.

260
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:51,020
我已经跟你说过了: 我不在乎
I already told you: I don't care.

261
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:52,355
这一点也不怪
It's not strange.

262
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:53,556
我知道
I know.

263
00:10:53,624 --> 00:10:54,691
好了 看看这有什么吧
All right, let's see here.

264
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:57,360
现在只需 呃 你紧抱着我
Now just, uh, wrap yourself around me.

265
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:58,595
这样可以吗
Is that okay?

266
00:10:58,662 --> 00:11:00,463
嗯 其实 你还可以抱得更紧点儿
Yeah, actually, you can hold me even tighter.

267
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:03,867
好 我只需再把手臂放在这儿
Okay, I just need to put this arm right around here.

268
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,518
恩 好了
Yeah, there we go.

269
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:08,521
搞定 现在我们就这样入睡吧
Good, now let's just fall asleep like this.

270
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,858
你的内裤有点扎人
Your boxers are a little starchy.

271
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:13,393
我能用我的脚帮你脱掉么
Can I take 'em off with my foot?

272
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,295
当然
Sure.

273
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:22,418

00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:52,448
"胜利终将属于我"
"Victory shall be mine"?

287

Look, in the past you've done terrible things,

291
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:01,808
但都是为了达到
but it's always been about the pursuit

292
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:03,776
你统治世界的更高的目的

293
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:07,413

I'm saying she's a bad influence on you,

296
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,818
所以你不应该再和她在一起了
and you should stop spending time with her.

297
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:13,086
我绝不会这么做的

我想我们可以在床上杀死她
I thought we could burn her in her bed

308
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,077
然后让她的孩子在边上看着
while her children watch.

309
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:39,512
你知道么 Penelope
You know, Penelope,

也许我们不用每天都杀人
maybe we don't have to kill someone every day.

311
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:44,500

00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:56,566
你知道么 我也想念和你相拥而眠了
'Cause, you know, I missed cuddling with you, too.

413
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:57,567
真的?
You did?

414
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:59,469
是真的
I sure did.

415
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:01,721
呃 那么 嘿…
Well, then, hey...

416
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,140
不如我们回家吧 如何
what do you say we go home, huh?

417
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,309
听上去不错
Sounds good to me.

418
00:17:06,377 --> 00:17:10,230
(gasping)

419
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,002
噢 Brian 找到你了
Oh, Brian, there you are!

420
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,237
- 谢天谢地 - 嘿 Stewie
- Thank God. - Oh, hey, Stewie.

421
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:18,571
那咖啡是你自己煮的?
Did you make that coffee?

422
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,240
呃 不是 我进来时就有了
Um, no, it was here when I came in.

423
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,375
- 我以为是Lois做的 - 不要喝
- I assume Lois made it. - Don't drink that!

424
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:24,644
嘿 这杯子是我"Class Holes"的员工礼物
Hey, that mug was my crew gift from "Class Holes."

425
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,312
你咬了口这个甜甜圈?
Did you take a bite out of this donut?

426
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,981
对 是台上盒子里的
Yeah, it was from a box on the counter.

427
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,249
- 那又怎么样 - 过了多久了
- So what? - How long ago?

428
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,383
不知道 5分钟?
I don't know. Five minutes?

429
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:31,701
还来得及
There's still time.

430
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:35,772
(gagging)

431
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,658
天 Stewie 你疯了啊
(coughing) God, Stewie, are you out of your mind?

432
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,794
相信我 我这么做是为了你好
Trust me, I'm only doing what's best for you.

433
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,413
嗯 我确实觉得瘦点了 感觉棒极了
Well, I do feel pretty thin and wonderful.

434
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,014
然后我还能吃下这甜甜圈
And I still got to eat the donut.

435
00:17:45,082 --> 00:17:46,432
为什么大家都不这么干呢
Why isn't everybody doing this?

436
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,151
谁说没有
They are.

437
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,155
我有个包裹给Brian Griffin
I've got a package here for Brian Griffin.

438
00:17:52,223 --> 00:17:53,239
噢 是我
Oh, that's me.

439
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:54,741
Brian 不要
Brian, no!

440
00:17:57,895 --> 00:17:59,646
Stewie 这到底是怎么回事
Stewie, what the hell is going on?

441
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,381
我很抱歉 Brian
I'm so sorry, Brian.

442
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,299
Penelope说我该杀了你
Penelope told me I had to kill you

443
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:04,784
因为你说我们应该分手
because you said we should break up,

444
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:06,452
但我做不来
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

445
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,855
然后她说她要杀了你…
So then she said she was gonna kill you and...

446
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:11,357
这-这可不关你的事
This-this is not for you.

447
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,660
真是怪了
That was weird.

448
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:14,828
他-他干嘛呢
W-What was he doing?

449
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,546
总之 Penelope想要杀了你
Anyway, Penelope's trying to kill you!

450
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:18,281
我告诉过你她不是个好东西
I told you she was bad news.

451
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:19,949
听着 我们先把你弄到个安全的地方去
Look, let's just get you someplace safe.

452
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:22,602
伙计 离开这儿
Dude, get out of here.

453
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,241
Stewie 闪一边去
Stewie, step aside.

454
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,193
Penelope 我不能让你这么干
Penelope,I can't let you do this.

455
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:31,561
Stewie 她才一岁
Stewie, she's one year old.

456
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:32,879
我想我自己能搞定
I think I can handle this myself.

457
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,785
好吧 Stewie 换你上
All right, Stewie, tag in.

458
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:50,230
慢-动-作-俯-冲-你
Slo-o-w mo-o-o-tion di-i-ving at yo-o-u!

459
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:09,816
(yells)

460
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:11,017
反重力枪
Anti-gravity gun!

461
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,885
这已经超过我的技术了
This is beyond my technology.

462
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:14,821
也许我制造一次电磁脉冲爆炸
Perhaps if I detonate an electromagnetic pulse,

463
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:15,888
可以抵消它
it will disable it.

464
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,497
(grunting, groaning)

465
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,382
(yells)

466
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:57,397
(yells)

467
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,628
离我的狗远点
Stay away from my dog.

468
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,746
很好 Stewie 我会的
Very well, Stewie. I shall.

469
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,381
但是还有一件事
But just one thing.

470
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:16,332
什么
What?

471
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:26,893
(gasps)

472
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,232
(horn honks)

473
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:39,772
这…
That was...

474
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,507
真美
beautiful.

475
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,776
我要告诉朋友们我上过她
I'm gonna tell my friends I banged her.

476
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:47,844
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

477
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,117
嘿 谢谢你救了我
Hey, thanks for saving my life.

478
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,769
这是我唯一能做的了
Well, it was the least I could do.

479
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,588
显然 关于Penelope你是对的
Obviously, it turns out you were right about Penelope.

480
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:56,789
你还好吗
You okay?

481
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,057
我会的
I will be.

482
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,392
我会的 宝贝儿
I will be, babe.

483
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,560
嘿 Meg
Oh, hey, Meg.

484
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:01,711
你之前在干嘛呢
What have you been up to?

485
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:01,711


486
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:01,711
