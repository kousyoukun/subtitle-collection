Hurricane Advisory,

to stay indoors

16

what that feels like?

What if I said
those things to you?

242
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,678
What if I started calling
you a fat, zitty loser,

243
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:52,212
who has no friends

244

Still drinkin'.

Is it too much to ask

00:11:58,086 --> 00:12:00,454
to be treated with a little
decency from my brother?

248
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:03,223
Maybe show me some
kind of kindness by not jumping

249
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,559

00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:48,939
I-I don't know that I ever
want to see you again.

320
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:54,394
(weeping loudly)

321
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:56,313
Oh wow, everybody's
already tweeting

322
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:57,564
"Stewie Just Said That."

323
00:14:57,632 --> 00:15:00,267
You're right.

324
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:02,002
You're right. I'm
a terrible mother.

325
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,037
I'm so sorry.

326
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:06,323
I'm so, so sorry, Meg.

327
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,575
Can you ever forgive me?

328
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:10,544
Oh, God.

329
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,915
And you never let Dad
stir the paint anymore,

330
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,300
whatever that means.

331
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:17,584
I didn't know you
knew that, Meg,

332
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:18,619
but I'm glad
you brought it up.

333
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:27,230
Oh, Meg, I don't
know what to say.

334
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,462
All of those things you
said about me are true.

335
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:33,298
I have been a very
bad mother to you.

336
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,351
I have no excuse.

337
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,770
I just have this horrible,
overwhelming desire

338
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,304
to point out faults in you.

339
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,473
I don't know
where it comes from.

340
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,642
Maybe it's because
I'm self-conscious

341
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,861
about being a bad parent.

342
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,146
I'm just, I'm so disgusted
with my behavior.

343
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,882
And I'm so sorry, Meg.

344
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,317
Yeah, you're a bitch.

345
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,270
Well, you know, I, I been sorta
just hangin' back here,

346
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:55,838
takin' all this in,
'cause I didn't think

347
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:57,506
I had a dog in this fight,

348
00:15:57,574 --> 00:15:59,141
but my money's on
Harry Potter over there.

349
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,159
Oh, you think
that's funny, fat ass?

350
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,211
Well, I don't know
if it's funny.

351
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,662
I-I think it's clever.

352
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,998
I mean, y-y-you got
the big glasses there...

353
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,184
I-I-I don't know. T-T-Tell me,
tell me what's on your mind.

354
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,603
Oh, I'll tell you,
Mister Selfish-ass Dad.

355
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,639
Hey. That's "Mister
Mister selfish-ass Dad"

356
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,590
to you, young lady.

357
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:16,508
Oh God, is she gonna do me next?

358
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,561
You are completely selfish,

359
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,696
and totally irresponsible
as a father.

360
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:23,632
All right, I see what's
goin' on here.

361
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,017
You're in love
with your old man.

362
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,270
You have no education,
you have no interests,

363
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,689
you just do whatever
reckless thing you want to do

364
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,126
whenever you want to do it
without regard for anyone else.

365
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,713
Oh, oh, and when you're not
terrorizing the community

366
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,298
with your impulsive escapades,

367
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,784
you're being a total
jerk to your family.

368
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:45,421
You shove your daughter's face
in your ass and you fart on it.

369
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,323
If someone
in the outside world

370
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,509
could see the way you treat
me, you would be in jail!

371
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,379
Oh, ha ha. Oh, this
is amusing to you.

372
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,281
Well, see if you
find this funny.

373
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,016
I like where this is going.

374
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,318
You are a fat,
lazy, abusive,

375
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,186
blue-collar
Irish Catholic dad

376
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,022
who drinks way too much

377
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,407
and barely makes enough
money to support his family.

378
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:06,842
You've lived half your life,

379
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,878
and you have nothing
to show for it.

380
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,948
Your only arguable
accomplishments are your kids,

381
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,201
and look at us; we're a disaster.
- Eh, watch it.

382
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,054
You're a total and
complete embarrassment

383
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,190
in every possible way.

384
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:23,559
Take a good look at yourself,
Peter Griffin.

385
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,678
You're a waste of a man.

386
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:29,548
Wait a second,
these are criticisms.

387
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,016
Hey, Lois, tell her
to knock it off.

388
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,602
Oh, and where the hell were you
when she was laying into me?

389
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,471
I was thinking about
getting a fancy cane.

390
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,373
Maybe getting more
attention from strangers.

391
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,175
Have either of you guys
been listening to me?

392
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:42,828
Do you both just have
your heads up your asses?

393
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,564
Dad did! Look, he's got
crap on his ears!

394
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:46,649
That's unrelated.

395
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,933
Chris, I don't like
that language.

396
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,735
Well, I don't like your cooking.

397
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:51,620
Well, I don't like having
to literally empty

398
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,989
the farts out of your pockets
whenever I do your laundry.

399
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,491
You're the one
who's always cookin'

400
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,293
Brussels sprouts
and broccoli.

401
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,945
It's like an Irish
bar fight down there.

402
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,447
You're from one town over,
so I hate your guts.

403
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,453
Why don't we ever
get any good food?!

404
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,255
Yeah, Bonnie gives
Joe Wonder Bread.

405
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:12,091
Well, then go live
at Bonnie's house.

406
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:13,509
Then I could
finally sleep in

407
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,095
and not have to answer your
stupid questions at 5:00 a.m.

408
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:18,263
My curiosity peaks
in the morning!

409
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:19,648
You eat all my
Dannon yogurts!

410
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,150
I don't see your
name on 'em!

411
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,235
You don't even like them!
But you know I do,

412
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,937
and you don't want
me to have them!

413
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,572
You know, I've never
confronted you on it,

414
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,240
but I've often thought
the same thing, Peter.

415
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,275
Yeah, that's exactly
what he does!

416
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:32,194
'Cause he's a selfish,
fat idiot!

417
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,462
You shut up,
all of yous!

418
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,250
I didn't ask to
be in this family!

419
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,570
Ugh, I'll go get him.

420
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:43,856
Peter? You
come back here!

421
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,642
I faked all my orgasms!

422
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,147
Hey.

423
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,217
What's goin' on?

424
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:57,903
You know, that was, uh,
that was pretty cool

425
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,455
the way you finally
stood up to everybody.

426
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:01,523
I don't know, Brian.

427
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:03,592
I mean, I, I meant
every word of it, but...

428
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,295
you saw what happened.
- What do you mean?

429
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:08,764
They all turned on each other
like a pack of wolves.

430
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:10,799
Well, so what? That's
not your problem.

431
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:13,168
Do you think it's
possible that...

432
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,404
that this family can't
survive without some sort of

433
00:19:15,472 --> 00:19:17,523
lightning rod to absorb
all the dysfunction?

434
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,024
Well, that's a...

435
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,709
that's a theory, I guess.

436
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:24,346
I mean, it-- it's not ideal,
but it's an important piece

437
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,649
that maybe it's just my
lot in life to provide.

438
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:30,853
Maybe if I feel bad,
they don't have to.

439
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,955
Wow.

440
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,340
You know, that's incredibly
noble and mature, Meg.

441
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,009
You know, I think you might be

442
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:38,710
the strongest person
in this house.

443
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,079
You mean that, Brian?

444
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,113
Absolutely.

445
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,035
Mom? Dad?

446
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,238
(Peter whimpering)

447
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:51,140
(sniffling, whimpering)

448
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,591
- Dad?
- Go away!

449
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,326
Dad, come out of there.

450
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:58,130
No! I don't deserve no better
than livin' with the shoes!

451
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,798
Peter, there you are.

452
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,667
You guys, I have
something to say.

453
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,753
You're right.
It's all my fault.

454
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:07,256
- What?
- Mom, you're an amazing mother

455
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:09,792
and all the things I said
about you were out of anger,

456
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:11,710
and I didn't mean any of them.

457
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,613
Chris, you're an
outstanding brother.

458
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:18,600
What I said about you was more
about me being a rotten sister.

459
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:22,354
And Dad, I'm so sorry that
I made you feel this way.

460
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,872
You don't deserve it.

461
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,874
None of you have
done anything wrong.

462
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,127
I took all my problems
out on you guys,

463
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,995
and that wasn't fair.

464
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:33,298
Oh, so this was all about you,
it wasn't about us.

465
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,466
Yeah.

466
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:35,868
Alright, that makes sense.

467
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,303
See, I thought it was
weird that I was a bad dad.

468
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,205
Meg, how could you put
us all through that?

469
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,807
I'm sorry, you guys.

470
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,809
You're a (bleep) bitch!

471
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:44,943
Yes.

472
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:45,894
Yes, I am.

473

Hi, I'm Stewie Griffin.
Tonight's <i>Family Guy</i>

474
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:57,168
was a very special episode
about drug use.

475
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,360
But the simple fact is,
it's no laughing matter.

476
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:03,522
To learn more about drugs,
visit your local library.

477
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,621
There's probably a guy behind
there who sells drugs.

478
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:09,230
Good night.

479
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:13,298
