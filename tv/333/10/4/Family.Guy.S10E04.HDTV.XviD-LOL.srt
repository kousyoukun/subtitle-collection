11
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:37,627
I was very brave when the doctor
gave me that shot,

12
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:38,402
wasn't I, Lois?

13
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,308
Yes, Peter, you
were very brave.

14
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:42,744
Even when I knew that he was
gonna give me the shot,

15
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,613
I just k-kept looking
at him in the eye

16
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,648
and talking to him
about my summer plans.

17
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:48,116
You did very good.

18
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,751
See, Peter? It
wasn't so bad.

19
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:51,453
Yeah, except for
having to sit next to

20
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:53,755
that screaming autistic lady
in the waiting room.

21
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,369
I don't know what you want!
I don't know how to help!

22
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:09,704
Hi, there. Excuse me.

23
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:12,006
I seem to be lost.
Can you guys help me?

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,275
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:14,809

27

and a ton of upcoming stuff?
Yeah, that's me.

28
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:21,215
I was on my way to Newport
and I kind of got turned around.

29
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,218
Ofourse, Mr. Reynolds, we'd be
happy to give you directions.

30
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:26,154
You take 138
to the Jamestown Bridge,

31
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:27,489
and you're gonna follow the...

32
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:28,523
There's a fire truck.

33
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:29,691
Yes, I see it, Peter.

34
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:30,925
It's a fire truck.

35
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,661
And after the bridge,
just follow the signs.

36
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:33,695
Thanks.

37
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,062
Hey, what happened to your arm?

38
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:37,565
I just went to the doctor,
got my cholesterol checked.

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,367
Wow, why does a guy in his 20s

40
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:40,902
need to get his
cholesterol checked?

41
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:42,337
Oh, come on, now.

42
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:44,105
Oh, hey, I never got your name.

43
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:45,239
Uh, Peter.
Peter Griffin.

Catch you later, Peter.

46
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:50,011
Wow, he was really nice.

47
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:52,681
Not like when I met
that bitch Shelley Duvall.

48
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,283
Hi, I'm Shelley Duvall.

49
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:56,484
Very nice to meet you.

50
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,852
Big deal.

51
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:00,522
Came right up to me, like
I was just dying to meet her.

52
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:02,657
Peter, you're gonna
have to let that one go.

53
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:10,665
Hi, Mrs. Janetti.
I'm here to pick up Stewie.

54
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,134
Oh, sure, Brian. He's in
the playroom with Gavin.

55
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,503
Gavin- that's
a stupid name.

56
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:17,305
And nobody likes you at school.

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,106
You're gonna be ugly
when you grow up.

58
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:20,842
And everything
in your house is cheap.

60
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,578
Oh, hey, Brian.

61
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:24,579
Bye!

62
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:29,183
That was fun.

63
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:30,652

Brian, I'm just going to sit

All right, but don't take to

96

What are you doing
in Cleveland's house?

97
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:57,305
Well, believe it or not,
they've decided

98
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:59,841
to shoot my movie
in Quahog instead of Newport.

99
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,243
I'm playing Hitler,
but he's a young Hitler

100
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:04,011

Hey, I'm so excited
that we're gonna be neighbors.

104
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:10,685
We should totally hang out.

Yeah, that'd be great.

106
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:14,556
Okay, I'm embarrassed.

107
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,758
I'm standing out here
without a shirt on

108
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:20,027
and my pajama bottoms are
riding insanely low on my hips.

109
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:21,863
Hey, how much money you make?

110
00:04:21,897 --> 00:04:23,498
You'd think enough
for a shirt, right?

111

So I'm having this
housewarming thing tonight,

Hey, Lois, what's
going on here?

Oh, it's my book club, Peter.

Come join us.

117
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,193
Oh, okay!

118
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:48,303
All right, let's see,
new novel, new novel, new novel.

119
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:50,806
What's it about?
What's it about?

120
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,440
A guy...

121
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:55,010
a guy who loses everything,

122
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,613
but finds his soul in Canada.

123
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:00,415
All right, we're cooking now.

124
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,416
Cooking now.

125
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,086
And the whole book
is an e-mail

126
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,322
to his daughter, who's dead.

127
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:09,891
And his name will be Norm Hull.

128
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:12,060
Because he's just a normal guy.

129
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,628
But not everybody
will get that.

130
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:16,264
That's just for e scholars
a hundred years from now.

131

Okay, Rupert,
you ready to go for a drive?

134
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,419
I'm driving a real car!

135
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:39,687
I don't believe it!

136
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:41,522
Well, I'd say we need
to put on some tunes.

160
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,592
Oh, my God, Brian's gonna be
so mad at me.

161
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,747
What am I gonna do?
Okay, it's all right.

162
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:02,364
I'll just get a little bit of
paint and cover up the dents.

163
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:04,399
Unattractive women
do it all the time.

164
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:06,100
You look pretty today, Carol.

165
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,269
Thanks.

166
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:09,638
It's probably just
the dress and the makeup.

167
00:07:09,672 --> 00:07:11,072
Ah, now that I look closer,

168
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:13,007
yeah, I think that's
what it is, too.

169
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:17,912
Hey, you made it!

170
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:19,180
And you brought a friend.

171
00:07:19,214 --> 00:07:20,181
Great.

172
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:21,583
I'm his wife, Lois.

173
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:23,017
We actually met the other day.

174
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,886
Oh, sorry,
I- I meet so many people.

175
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,921
But there's really no way
you could know that.

176
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:28,256
Yeah, she's a housewife,
she don't know.

177
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,257
Whatever.

178
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:31,293
You got booze in here?

179
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,361
Is it me, or did she
just make that weird?

180
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:35,163
Please. It was
definitely not you.

181
00:07:35,197 --> 00:07:36,631
Hey, is this shirt too tight?

182
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,632
I'm feeling really
self-conscious.

183
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,000
No, not at all.

184
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,968
So it-it looks good like
this? Yeah, it looks good.

185
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:41,969
Thanks.

186
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,571
I don't know what to say.

187
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:44,739
Hey, I got, I got, like,

188
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:46,641
an insider Hollywood
question for you.

189
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:49,311
Is, um, is "L.A."
short for something?

190
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,045
Ha! You're a riot.

191
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,980
Hey, hey, so what's
all this about,

192
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,016
everyone in Quahog
likes to tickle fight?

193
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,250
What is that?

194
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:57,519
What? I never heard that.

195
00:07:57,553 --> 00:07:59,120
Yeah, apparently
it's, like, a thing.

196
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,355
It is?
Yeah.

197
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,256
I mean, they also said
that people who pretend

198
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,025
not to have heard
of it are chicken.

199
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:05,460
Well, I ain't no chicken.

200
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:07,261
One-nothing!

201
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:08,530
No, two-nothing!

202
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:10,965
Three-nothing!

203
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,467
Fight over!
Fight over!

204
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,636
Wow, you got a lot
of catching up to do,

205
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,103
and tomorrow night
in the dark, huh?

206
00:08:16,138 --> 00:08:17,104
In the dark?

207
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,373
Yeah, if you say so.

208
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:20,107
Just don't tickle me
in my lower abdomen.

209
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:21,509
I'm super ticklish there.

210
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,445
<i>Lower abdomen.</i>

211
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,947
<i>You're gonna wish
you never said that.</i>

212
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:28,149
This might be
totally off the wall,

213
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:31,319
but are you doing
anything Thursday night?

214
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:32,954
You probably have
plans, anyway.

215
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:34,322
You know what...

216
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:35,824
Forget it, forget
it, forget it.

217
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:37,359
Blah. Nervous.

218
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:40,695
You know, Ryan,
most people take one look at me

219
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,665
and just assume that I have
plans, so I never get asked out.

220
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:46,501
But I-I frequently
don't have plans, so yes,

221
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:48,570
I would love to do something
with you on Thursday night.

222
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:51,272
Yes! Oh, my God, right now
would be the worst time

223
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:52,940
for you to tickle
my lower abdomen,

224
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:55,076
because it's so exposed
'cause I'm cheering.

225
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,944
Yeah, Thursday night!

226
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:59,180
Aw, your big mouth
just got you in trouble.

227
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:00,348
Aw, I lose.

228
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:02,049
Peter one, you zero.
Oh, I lose again.

229
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,785
Peter two, you zero.
You've been practicing.

230
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:09,791
We now return to the end of
a depressing 1970s sci-fi movie

231
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:11,760
starring a guy in a turtleneck.

232
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,497
We've gone far enough.

233
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:17,932
I think we're safe from
The Corporation here.

234
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:19,367
Adzin, ook!

235
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,547
It can't be.

236
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:34,048
No!

237
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:36,484
We'll never defeat
The Corporation!

238
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,152
They've won!

239
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:39,987
There is one way, Adzin.

240
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:41,589
You can shoot yourself.

241
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:45,593
If it's the only way, I must.

242
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,484
What the hell?!

243
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:12,019
Stewie, get out here!

244
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:13,888
Look at this.

245
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:15,222
Do you know anything
about this?

246
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,257
A- About what?

247
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,759
About what
a beautiful day it...

248
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:20,795
Oh, my God, that is surprising.

249
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,197
Oh, I had to stop that
last sentence in the middle

250
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:24,432
because I was so surprised.

251
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:26,200
What happened?
Gee, I don't know.

252
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,335
Do you know what happened?

253
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,537
I'm sorry, w-what was that?

254
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:31,172
I- I was laughing
at that funny thing

255
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,674
you said at dinner
the other night.

256
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,541
What funny thing?

257
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:36,110
Um, y-you remember
what you said

258
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:38,780
about Lois's, um,
"patoes au rotten"?

259
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:41,349
Huh. Didn't ink
anybody heard that.

260
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:42,717
Wish you'd laughed at the time.

261
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:44,318
W- What the hell
happened to my car?!

262
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,654
Well, I don't know, man,
but the good news is,

263
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,656
it-it doesn't look
all that bad, Brian.

264
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,992
It's just,
it's that spot right there

265
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,259
that's upsetting you, right?

266
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:54,629
Stewie, I know it was you.

267
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,635
Your potato joke was terrible.

268
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,403
I can't believe
you drove my car!

269
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:03,972
You could have
gotten yourself killed!

270
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:05,840
I'm gonna have to tell
Peter and Lois.

271
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,174
No! No, you can't tell them!

272
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,476
I'll be in so much trouble!

273
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:09,644
Stewie, I have to.

274
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:11,245
All right,
I have covered for you

275
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,981
plenty of times before,
but not this time.

276
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:14,181
This is very dangerous,

277
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,518
and have to make sure
you never do it again.

278
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,752
I won't, I swear!

279
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,158
Stewie, calm down.

280
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:27,294
Sometimes in life you just have
to accept what's coming to you.

281
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:29,296
Like the contestant
who gets the lesser showcase

282
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:30,598
<i>on The Price is Right.</i>

283
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,500
Lindsay, your showcase

284
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:34,836
is all about relaxation.

285
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,807
And what better place to relax
than in your brand-new hammock?!

286
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:42,744
This sturdy and portable hammock
from Swingway turns any patio

287
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:45,046
into a tropical paradise.

288
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,715
And you can entertain yourself
on your patio

289
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,717
by drawing with chalk!

290
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,186
Yes, Pratt and Millwood
eight-color pastel chalk

291
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,389
will turn your patio
into a tropical art studio.

292
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,158
But you'll have
to pack your chalk

293
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:58,626
because you're going
to be staying

294
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:00,127
six days and seven nights

295
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:03,698
at your parents' house
in Wilmington, Delaware!

296
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:06,500
I moved my abortion for this.

297
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,905
♪ ♪

298
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:16,310
Um, hey, thanks for taking
me out to dinner, Ryan,

299
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:19,080
but I got to say, this
food looks a little weird.

300
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,915
Aw, Peter, Moroccan food
is the jizz.

301
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,485
I don't know. Looks like it
might give me the kind of farts

302
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,087
I get from eating Mexican food.

303
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,360
<i>Con cuidado es el stinko!</i>

304
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,731
Hey, do these pants
look all right?

305
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:39,467
Sometimes I put them on, and
I'm thinking I look all balls.

306
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:40,668
No, I think you're good.

307
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:42,003
You think my balls are good?

308
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:43,504
You're so weird.

309
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:44,939
It's awesome, though.

310
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,474
Oh, I... I don't know.

311
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:47,709
Hey, have you noticed

312
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,911
what a jerk the mailman is
in this town?

313
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:52,146
Like, he said there is no way

314
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,248
Peter Griffin
could crush a baby bird

315
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:56,084
with his bare foot
while I watched.

316
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:58,886
That guy talks
more crap about me.

317
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:01,589
Mmm! Oh!

318
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:03,658
Mmm. You got to taste
this lamb tagine.

319
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,093
Mmm. Here.

320
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:06,393
No, that... no,
that's okay.

321
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:07,695
Come on, you'll love it.

322
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,863
Eh...

323
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:10,131
Just a taste.

324
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:21,275
That was... intense.

325
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:22,476
What you just did.

326
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,412
Lots of...

327
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:26,848
Lots of flavors.

328
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:28,215
Whoops.

329
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,652
Whoa, freeze frame!

330
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,253
What's gonna happen next?

331
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,321
I think I got to
go to the bathroom.

332
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,266
What am I gonna do?

333
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,901
I'm gonna be in so much trouble

334
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:48,770
when they find out
I wrecked Brian's car!

335
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:50,638
They'll probably ship me off
to Siberia.

336
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:52,506
This sucks.
I hate it here.

337
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,741
Shut up.

338
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:56,477
Drink wolf milk and
watch Russian cartoons.

339
00:13:56,511 --> 00:14:00,447
<i>MAN WITH RUSSIAN ACCENT: We now return to
popular Russian cartoon, Shoe and Shoelace.</i>

340
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:01,849
Shoe and Shoelace!

341
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,685
One is meaningless
without the other!

342
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:11,125
Well, that's it.

343
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,393
I have nchoice.

344
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:15,196
I've got to run away.

345
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:22,636
Guess I'm on my own now, Rupert.

346
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:24,072
It could be worse, though.

347
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,673
At least I'm not getting stabbed

348
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,709
by some random guy
on the street.

349
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:31,312
See? It's the exact opposite.

350
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:33,314
Oh! It happened anyway!

351
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,557
Hey, Stewie, you up?

352
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:45,428
What the...

353
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,505
Brian, I've decided to run away.

354
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,925
Don't come looking for me.

355
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,260
And definitely don't chase me
to the airport

356
00:14:53,294 --> 00:14:54,729
and catch me at the gate

357
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,898
just before I'm about
to get on the plane

358
00:14:56,932 --> 00:14:58,966
with, like, an emotional speech
and possibly flowers.

359
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,434
For example, it would be awful

360
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:02,637
if all the TSA people were
gathered around,

361
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:04,071
watching this emotional moment,

362
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:06,440
even the older black female
carry-on scanner

363
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:08,643
who initially stopped you
at the baggage check,

364
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:11,245
but who after you told her
of your intentions, said,

365
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,614
"Go get him, child,"
in flagrant disregard

366
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,918
of all newly-implemented
post-9-11 security measures.

367
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:19,153
And if you were considerin
bringing a boom box

368
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:22,690
to play music, I would suggest
any one of these six songs.

369
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:28,395
So again, ran away.

370
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,764
Don't come after me.

371
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:34,301
♪ I want to thank you... ♪

372
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,675
Dirty whores, all of you.

373
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,076
Oh, hey, Peter.

374
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,644
Lois, we got a problem.

375
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,047
I think Ryan Reynolds
is in love with me.

376
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:48,215
What? Don't be ridiculous.

377
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,051
It's true. Last night we were
at this restaurant,

378
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,518
and he tried to gay kiss me.

379
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:53,287
I'm telling you,
he wants to get with me.

380
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:54,755
Peter, come on.

381
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,458
Why would any man dress well,
groom himself and lift weights

382
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:59,026
just to sleep with other men?

383
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:00,360
He's not gay.

384
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:02,797
Well, I don't care what you say.
He likes me.

385
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,865
And we do have chemistry,
I- I won't deny that.

386
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,634
I- I... I will take
responsibility

387
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:08,102
fomy part in this.

388
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:10,537
I'm just gonna go over there
and let him down easy.

389
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:14,208
Oh, Snooki died.

390
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:18,112
Last stop.

391
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,016
What? This isn't the airport.

392
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:24,485
Oh, my God, Rupert!

393
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,220
We've got to get out of here!

394
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:28,422
Aah! Damn it!

395
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:29,657
Oh, no, no.

396
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,025
Baby fall down!

397
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:33,260
Is that...? Is that Consuela?

398
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:36,998
Baby all alone in street.

399
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:38,332
I take baby home.

400
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,134
It's me. Stewie.
Don't you remember?

401
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:41,769
You used to clean for us.

402
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:44,171
We used to make you use the
bathroom at the gas station.

403
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:48,575
Hey, you!

404
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,944
Uh, hey, Ryan.

405
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:51,211
Uh, bad time?

406
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:52,647
Um, perfect time.

407
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:55,650
Come on in.
I was just oiling my legs.

408
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:57,018
So, hey, what's on for tonight?

409
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:58,853
You know, my dentist
leaves his office unlocked.

410
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,655
I was thinking we
could do some nitrous

411
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:01,956
and then have dinner in there.

412
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,525
Look, Ryan, you're a great guy
and everything,

413
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,061
but I don't like you
in that way.

414
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:09,697
I mean, there are some things
that I would do with you,

415
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,565
but my heart wouldn't be in it.

416
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,233
What are you talking about?

417
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:16,436
That you like me,
and you want to be my boyfriend.

418
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,406
You think I'm gay?

419
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,241
Where did you get that?

420
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:23,210
Uh, uh, you-you tried
to kiss me.

421
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:24,845
Peter, I'm not gay.

422
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,781
What the hell's
the matter with you?

423
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:29,449
Look, look, look, let me...
let me put it to you this way.

424
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:30,951
I'm attracted to you in the way

425
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:33,921
that a man is attracted
to a woman, but I'm not gay.

426
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:35,890
When you live out in
Hollywood, you learn

427
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:37,892
that life is about different
spirits and energies

428
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,293
you meet along the way.

429
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,063
I just thought maybe our spirits
could intertwine, you know?

430
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,931
Ouenergies could merge.

431
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,533
Like my spirit could go
up inside your energy.

432
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:49,136
I- I have so much to learn
about show business.

433
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:50,504
But you know what?

434
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,306
I could never really be
attracted to somebody

435
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,142
who uses labels like
"gay" and "straight."

436
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:56,610
Maybe you should just go.

437
00:17:56,644 --> 00:17:57,912
Well-Well, now,
wait a second.

438
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,146
What do you mean?

439
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:00,280
This isn't working.

440
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:01,515
It was a nice thought,

441
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,718
but I think we should
go our separate ways.

442
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:05,619
No, Ryan. I get it now.

443
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:07,321
I can be what you want.

444
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:08,756
We could...
Peter.

445
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,057
Don't embarrasyourself.

446
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:11,726
You need to just let this go.

447
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:15,129
Tickle fight! Tickle
fight! No, Peter, no!

448
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:17,064
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!
Tickle fight... Peter, no! No!

449
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,233
Oh, my God...

450
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:25,072
It's time for you to leave.

451
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:29,844
I can change.

452
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:31,511
I can change.

453
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:32,980
I'm sorry, Peter.
We're done.

454
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:34,514
We can never talk again.

455
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,852
Here's a cell phone
so we can always talk.

456
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,591
Don't you guys
have any tub toys?

457
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,060
Here. Is rattle.

458
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:48,162
This is prescription
medication.

459
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:50,430
And it's not even
your name on the label.

460
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:51,899
What... What is this?

461
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:53,200
What's in this tub?

462
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,902
Is jicama.
Jicama?

463
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:56,670
And what is...?
What...? What...?

464
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:58,105
This is a chicken leg.

465
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,274
Are you also making soup?

466
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,742
For quinceañera.

467
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,577
Big party. Many peoples.

468
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:04,879
Oh, my God.

469
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:06,346
<i>Hay un perro aqui.</i>

470
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:08,448
<i>¿Doggy es aqui?</i>

471
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:11,385
<i>I bet even you guys
don't watch George Lopez.</i>

472
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:13,320
Consuela?

473
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:14,688
Hey, it's Brian.

474
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:16,056
I'm-I'm looking for Stewie.

475
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:18,325
<i>No, no baby aqui.</i>

476
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,626
I peed in your soup.

477
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:20,961
Happy 15th birthday.

478
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:22,329
Which, by the way,

479
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:24,731
is not a special occasion
in the normal world.

480
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,000
Stewie, I've been worried sick.

481
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,634
What the hell
are you doing here?

482
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,136
Brian? How did you find me?

483
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:31,939
I used my nose,
which I always forget about.

484
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,107
Come on, let's go.

485
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:34,809
No, I'm not going
back! I can't!

486
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:36,243
They're gonna be mad at me!

487
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:38,045
I didn't tell anyone.

488
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,047
You... you didn't?

489
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,248
No, I didn't.

490
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:43,517
Look, I thought about it,
and to be honest,

491
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:46,287
it's probably my fault for
leaving you alone in the car.

492
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:49,523
And if you promise never to do
it again, I won't say anything.

493
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:51,558
Okay, I promise.

494
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:52,860
My baby!
What?

495
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:54,328
I say, let go of me.

496
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:55,462
Consuela, we're leaving.

497
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:56,630
My baby!

498
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:58,866
Hey, she says
it's her baby, man.

499
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,467
Now, get out of here.

500
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:04,271
Is my baby. Ernesto.

501
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:05,772
No, I'm not...
I'm not Ernest...

502
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:08,876
Okay, this is so messed up
right now.

503
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,885
I did not want
to have to do that.

504
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,787
They were very nice
to me up until then.

505
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:25,159
Peter, stop staring
outhe window.

506
00:20:25,193 --> 00:20:26,593
Ryan's gone.

507
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,628
He finished his movie,
he's moved out.

508
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:30,497
How could I have been so blind?

509
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:33,300
How could I not have seen
what he offered?

510
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:35,269
I think the whole
thing was very strange.

511
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:36,503
<i>He thought you were strange!</i>

512
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:39,340
How about that?
Whatever.

513
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:41,575
I just can't help but wonder...

514
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,283
will I ever see him again?

515
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:51,185
