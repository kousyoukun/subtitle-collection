12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,121
Oh, hey,
there you are.

13
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:38,156
Hey, listen, I got something
really cool I want you to see.

14
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:39,257
What is it?

15
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:41,192
This.
I found it in the yard.

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,227
A tennis ball.

17
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:44,429
That's very impressive, Brian.

18
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:46,231
Yeah, but don't tell the other
dogs in the neighborhood.

19
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:47,265
They'll be jealous.

20
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,134
You son of a bitch.

21
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:50,301
And this is nothing.

22
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:51,569
There's one tennis
ball out there

23
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:53,138
that's even cooler
'cause I peed on it.

24
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:54,272
Buried it years ago.

25
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,640
I just can't
remember where.

26
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,142
I'd give anything
to find it, though.

27
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:59,210
Well, if you could recall
exactly when you buried it,

28
00:00:59,278 --> 00:01:00,645
I suppose I could
help you out.

29
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:02,113
I remember the exact day.

30
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:04,416
January 31, 1999.

31
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:06,418
Very well, follow me, Brian.

32
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:08,253
Watch out for Ernie.

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,122
He's getting a CAT scan.

34

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

35
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:29,340
Well, here we are.

36
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:30,909
That's odd.

37
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:33,411
It's our house, but somehow
it looks a little different.

38
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,213
Mom, my lips
are too thin.

39
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:37,015
Can I please get
collagen injections?

40
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,217
Meg, you don't need
to change the way you look.

41
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:40,819
You know, most of
the world's problems

42
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:42,721
stem from poor self-image.

43
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:44,222
Oh, my God,
what's with Meg's voice?

44
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,657
She sounds like someone

45
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:47,592
who's about to give up
a huge opportunity.

46
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,094
That's nothing.
Look at you.

47
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:51,830
You look like a prize at some
Mexican church carnival.

48
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,064
Excellent.

49
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:54,799
The mind control device
is nearing completion.

50
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:57,402
Stewie, I said
no toys at the table.

51
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,670
Damn you, vile woman!

52
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:00,305
You've impeded my work
since the day

53
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:02,040
I escaped from
your wretched womb.

54
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:03,575
Oh, don't pout, honey.

55
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:06,377
You know, when you were born,
the doctor said you were

56
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:08,813
the happiest looking baby
he'd ever seen.

57
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,848
But of course.

58
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:11,316
That was my victory day.

59
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:13,284
The fruition
of my deeply-laid plans

60
00:02:13,352 --> 00:02:15,987
to escape from that cursed
ovarian bastille.

61
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:17,522
Return the device, woman!

62
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,691
Geez. What, did you carry
a thesaurus around with you?

63
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,526
You know, it's amazing
I could speak at all

64
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:23,061
with that circumcision
still healing.

65
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:24,195
Hey, wait a minute, Stewie.

66
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:25,363
That's the spot!

67
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:26,698
That's where I buried
my tennis ball!

68
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:27,799
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

69
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:28,800
Brian, what
are you doing?

70
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:30,201
You can't dig
it up here.

71
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:32,070
Just make a mental note
of where you buried it,

72
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:33,304
and as soon as we're
back in the present,

73
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:34,405
you can dig it up then.

74
00:02:34,473 --> 00:02:35,940
- Why?
- Because we can't risk

75
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:37,709
doing anything that
alters the past.

76
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:39,043
You know, I never got that.

77
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:41,479
I mean, w-wouldn't you want
to alter the past?

78
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,715
I mean, you could make life
better for yourself.

79
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:45,717
And not just for yourself,
for everyone.

80
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:47,752
You-You could stop 9/11.

81
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,255
Brian, there's one rule
of time travel, and that is:

82
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:52,223
Do not alter the past in any way

83
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,958
or the consequences
could be dire.

84
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:54,959
Yeah, where'd
you hear that?

85
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:56,161
<i>Quantum Leap.</i>

86
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:58,062
That guy changed the past
all the time!

87
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,330
Whoa, ass ahoy.

88
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:01,766
Hey, Peter, it's 7:00

89
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,067
and you've still
got your pants on.

90
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:04,035
What's the occasion?

91
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,403
Ew, I remember this.

92
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,338
Peter's eye did
that weird creepy thing

93
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:08,907
where it went
over his nose.

94
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:10,875
Come on, you're
worrying about nothing.

95
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:12,744
Oh? Remember when
you got drunk

96
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:14,479
off the communion wine
at church?

97
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:15,580
Ah! Ew! Gross!

98
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:16,714
Look at that.

99
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:19,117
Wait, what are
they doing?

100
00:03:19,185 --> 00:03:20,285
I don't know.

101
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:22,253
They're just standing there
like zombies.

102
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:23,688
Do you think
they're all right?

103
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:26,124
I-I'm not sure.

104
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:28,726
And then there was that time
at the ice cream store.

105
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:32,330
They're doing it again.
What the hell?

106
00:03:32,398 --> 00:03:33,698
I-I'm at a loss.

107
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,533
I mean, I know we're not
supposed to mess with

108
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:37,902
the timeline, but should
we call an ambulance?

109
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,806
That is so creepy.

110
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:43,741
And remember you had
an Irish coffee

111
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:46,311
the day we went
to see <i>Philadelphia?</i>

112
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:48,646
Oh. They're do-- they're
setting up (bleep) cutaways.

113
00:03:48,714 --> 00:03:50,648
Oh, my God, is that
what we did back then?

114
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,083
Yeah, I mean,
now, we just like

115
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:54,552
return text messages
and screw around and whatnot.

116
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,688
Lois, I'm not going
back to work tomorrow.

117
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:58,389
That new boss
has it in for me.

118
00:03:58,457 --> 00:04:00,758
He's meaner than
a shifty salesman.

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
You sure you got time
to smoke?

120
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:10,935
Oh, yeah,
it's an Al Harrington.

121
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:12,570
It goes on for a while.

122
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:14,772
All right, look, we found out
where your ball is buried.

123
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,274
Now let's get back
to our own time.

124
00:04:16,342 --> 00:04:17,709
Okay, get the return pad.
Let's go.

125
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:18,776
Not out here
in the open.

126
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:20,044
Someone could see us.

127
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:21,813
Remember? No altering
the timeline?

128
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,015
Come on, let's
get up to my room.

129
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,217
Hey, wait a minute, Stewie,
I got to take a leak.

130
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:27,585
Will it screw up
the timeline

131
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:29,554
if my future pee goes
in a past toilet?

132
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:31,756
Uh, no, as long as
it goes in the toilet.

133
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:33,491
One splash on
a magazine in there,

134
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,894
and we're getting
chased by dinosaurs.

135
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,764
Huh. Looks more or less
the same.

136
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:41,866
Oh, my God, my Japanese
children's books.

137
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:43,401
I forgot about these.

138
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:44,969
<i>You Poop Now.</i>

139
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:47,205
<i>Horton Hears a Suicide.</i>

140
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:50,008
<i>The Little Engine That Will,</i>
<i>Or Get Great Shame.</i>

141
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:51,075
Oh, there you are.

142
00:04:51,143 --> 00:04:52,110
All right,
come on, Brian.

143
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:53,211
Let's get
out of here.

144
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,479
Blast, that draggle-tailed,

145
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:55,980
blunt-edged,
matriarchal despot!

146
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:57,949
Who the deuce
does she think she is?!

147
00:04:58,017 --> 00:04:58,950
Quick, Brian, hide!

148
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:03,988
I shall cleverly disguise this
lethal plasma disruptor device

149
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:06,324
as a tuna fish sandwich,
whereupon I shall end

150
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:08,693
that wretched woman's
Draconian reign of tyranny!

151
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:18,603
Oh. Hey.

152
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,904
Who the deuce
are you?

153
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:23,041
Uh, well, I'm, uh...
I'm you.

154
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:25,643
You look like me, but
that's utterly impossible.

155
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:27,011
I'm afraid it's true.

156
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,346
I'm you from the future.

157
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:29,614
I've traveled back in time.

158
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:30,982
That's absurd.

159
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,384
Look, I can prove to you
that I'm you from the future.

160
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:35,987
I know about
the Eddie Bauer catalog.

161
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:37,588
It is you!

162
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:39,590
Okay, bye, Lois.

163
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:42,126
I'm going to the stag party.

164
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:43,628
Brian, you might as well
come out now.

165
00:05:43,696 --> 00:05:44,662
He knows everything.

166
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:49,300
Uh-oh.

167
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:08,886
Brian, are you
all right?

168
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:09,887
Yeah, I'm fine.

169
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:10,989
Where'd you get that?

170
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:12,256
The Stewie from
the past has

171
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,958
a lot more gadgets
and things than I do.

172
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:15,360
I've kind of slacked
off a little bit.

173
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,362
How's the party?
Looks like fun.

174
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:19,197
Hey, who wants to play
"Drink the Beer"?

175
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:20,231
Right here.

176
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:21,666
- You win!
- All right!

177
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:23,634
- What do I win?
- Another beer!

178
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:26,571
Okay, take a last look,
'cause we're out of here.

179
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:28,039
Oh, look at that.

180
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:29,907
There's the old gang
we've gotten to know

181
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:31,376
so well over the years.

182
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,880
TV's not even
plugged in.

183
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:42,787
What is this?

184
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:44,122
Where the
hell are we?

185
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,556
The air is electric

186
00:06:45,624 --> 00:06:48,026
here at Super Bowl 33 tonight.

187
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,660
- Stewie, what's going on?
- I don't know.

188
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:50,995
For some reason,
the time machine

189
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:52,230
didn't take us
back to the present.

190
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:53,731
We're still in 1999.

191
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,400
Wait a minute.
I remember this.

192
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,168
I think I'm up
in that blimp.

193
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:01,105
Amazing. You can
barely drive a car,

194
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:02,974
and yet you were
allowed to fly a blimp?

195
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,008
Yeah, America's
great, isn't it?

196
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:05,410
'Cept for the South.

197
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:08,079
Oh, no wonder the return pad
didn't take us all the way.

198
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,781
The batteries
are almost depleted.

199
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:11,049
Are those D batteries?

200
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:12,717
Yes, ever since we had
that trouble in Germany,

201
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:14,152
I found a way to convert it

202
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:16,254
so it takes D batteries
instead of uranium.

203
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:18,389
Only problem is, I didn't
bring any cash with me.

204
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:19,724
Did you?

205
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,092
I don't think that's
gonna be a problem.

206
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:24,328
Oh, my God!
Quick, grab some money!

207
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:28,266
Do you, do you
have pockets?

208
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,767
Are you putting that
in pockets?

209
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,002
That's so cute.

210
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:37,041
The crowd is storming the field!

211
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:38,409
This is pandemonium!

212
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:53,324
Quick, Brian, get on!

213
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:00,698
Whoa, crash ahoy.

214
00:08:04,603 --> 00:08:06,904
Oh, God!
Now where are we?

215
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,510
Well, you know, I figured
the sooner I cashed the check,

216
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:14,345
the sooner they'd, uh,
catch their mistake.

217
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:17,849
Look, why are we making
a federal case out of this?

218
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,250
Oh, man, this
is the day

219
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:21,119
Peter went to court
for his welfare fraud.

220
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:25,256
Hey.

221
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:26,858
Huh? Oh, hey.

222
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:28,059
You're the Kool-Aid Guy.

223
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:29,093
Yeah.

224
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:30,261
What are you doing?

225
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:31,329
Just waiting.

226
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:32,530
For what?

227
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:33,965
I'm just waiting,
dude-- relax.

228
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:36,434
Hey, is there any place around
here that sells batteries?

229
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:37,668
Guys, d-don't
distract me, all right?

230
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:39,137
I gotta really be up.

231
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:42,106
Mr. Griffin, I think your
words have touched us all.

232
00:08:42,174 --> 00:08:44,809
I'm sentencing you
to 24 months in prison!

233
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:46,244
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

234
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:47,478
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

235
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:52,150
So there's no organs
or glands or anything, right?

236
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:53,384
It's just the liquid?

237
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:54,719
Yeah. Yeah, it's
just the liquid.

238
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:56,954
Um, I don't know
if this is a weird question,

239
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:59,090
but... can I have some?

240
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:00,691
All right, fine.
Tilt your head back,

241
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,593
and I'll lean my liquid
down into your mouth.

242
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:04,061
Oh, now I don't want it.

243
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:05,463
Oh, crap!
Did I miss it?!

244
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:08,799
Look, my husband may be
a bit thoughtless at times;

245
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:11,836
he may even be downright,
well, stupid,

246
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:15,406
but I know he only accepted
that money because he...

247
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:17,842
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Yeah!

248
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:29,554
You guys did this!

249
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:31,289
You guys (bleep) did this!

250
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:32,690
Talking about my guts?!

251
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:34,125
me up?!
you!

252
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,105
Okay, this is good.

253
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:42,239
We got the
D batteries.

254
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:43,307
Let's get back
to the present.

255
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,875
All right, get on.

256
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,850
We made it.

257
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:54,318
Yeah, the Super Bowl
was cool,

258
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,221
but frankly, no Tommy Brady,
no Stewie likey.

259
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:58,656
Brian, there you are!

260
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,157
Come quick,
they're about to announce

261
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,292
the unveiling of
your statue on the news.

262
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,794
Statue?! For what?

263
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:05,929
What do you think,
Mr. National Hero?

264
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:09,600
For stopping the 9/11 terrorist
attacks and saving our country.

265
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:11,035
Oh, you--

266
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:14,405
I can't even express
how mad I am at you right now.

267
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:15,773
If it wasn't for you,

268
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,208
those planes would've hit
the World Trade Center.

269
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:19,843
Brian, what the hell
did you do?!

270
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:23,714
I, uh, may have told my
former self about 9/11.

271
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:25,716
What did I tell you
about altering the past?!

272
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:27,351
Wait-Wait, when did you
even do that?

273
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,520
Well, you remember when I said
I was going to take a leak?

274
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,055
Brian, you shouldn't
have done that.

275
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:33,691
Who knows what unforeseen
consequences are awaiting us.

276
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,492
Saddam Hussein
could be president.

277
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,861
Mexico could be the world's
dominant super power.

278
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,963
Cookie Monster could have
invented Facebook!

279
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,498
What is this?

280
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:42,933
Cookiebook.

281
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:43,901
Brian!

282
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:45,302
Hurry, it's starting!

283
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,405
Good evening.
I'm Tom Tucker.

284
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:49,973
And I'm Joyce Kinney.

285
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,710
Our top story: Quahog prepares
to unveil a new statue

286
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,678
commemorating perhaps
its greatest hero ever.

287
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:56,380
That's right, Tom.

288
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,149
It was ten years ago that an
almost inconceivable plot

289
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:00,751
to destroy the
World Trade Center

290
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:03,420
was thwarted by Quahog's
own Brian Griffin.

291
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:05,956
This amateur video
captured Griffin's heroism

292
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:08,459
in the face of a shadowy
terrorist organization called--

293
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:10,360
holy (bleep),
look at all those vowels--

294
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:13,764
Al Qua-aye-eeda.

295
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:15,999
Here.
Make sure you get all this.

296
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:20,838
Time to terrorize
the terrorists.

297
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:23,307
Ugh. You prepared
catch phrases for yourself?

298
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:25,209
No. Not necessarily.

299
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:29,713
Mohammed Atta stayed home.

300
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:31,115
Nobody knows
that guy's name yet.

301
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:33,417
You're using information
that nobody knows.

302
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:37,254
Houston, we have a solution.

303
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,857
Houston's for space,
not everyday air travel.

304
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,392
Tell them to ground every plane
out of the East Coast.

305
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,794
Seacrest out.

306
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,666
Wow. What a hero.

307
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:51,435
Coming up next in sports:

308
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,237
Arizona Cardinal
Pat Tillman

309
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:55,305
tackled by his own team?

310
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:56,974
Oh, Brian,
we're so proud of you.

311
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,175
Yeah, buddy.

312
00:11:58,243 --> 00:11:59,610
Great job stopping
those terrorists.

313
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,111
And thank God
their follow-up attack

314
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,913
on St. Louis was a bust.

315
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,116
<i>We missed!</i>

316
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,852
Brian, I promise you,
all of this can only end badly.

317
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,154
Stewie, it's fine.

318
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:11,622
I prevented 9/11.

319
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,490
How could that possibly
be a bad thing?

320
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,692
I mean, come on, I-I
saved, like, 200 lives.

321
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
3,000.

322
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,295
Wow! 3,000?!

323
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,397
Oh, you knew what you
were doing there.

324
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:22,432
This major
breaking news just in.

325
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,001
Nine Southern states
have declared

326
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,836
that they are seceding
from the United States.

327
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,037
The announcement came

328
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:29,006
from former President
George W. Bush,

329
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:30,541
who reformed
the Confederacy

330
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:33,877
after a bitter loss in
his 2004 reelection bid.

331
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:35,579
Bush lost in 2004?

332
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:36,713
Yeah, he probably
couldn't

333
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:38,816
exploit people's
fears with no 9/11.

334
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,050
Bush appeared
before the press today

335
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:41,652
to make this brief statement.

336
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,986
If anyone out there can get

337
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,755
their hands
on a clown's suitcase,

338
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:47,057
I'd very much like to see
what's inside of there.

339
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,359
I think we have the wrong clip.

340
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:51,695
What? No?

341
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:53,530
It... this...?

342
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,699
Uh, okay,
that was George W. Bush

343
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,835
declaring civil war
on the Northern states.

344
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,937
Oh, my God!
Civil war?

345
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:01,338
See, Brian?

346
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,773
This is exactly
what I was talking about.

347
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:04,341
Look, Stewie, this
doesn't necessarily mean

348
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,876
things are going
to turn out badly.

349
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:07,578
In fact, I bet, five
years from now,

350
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:09,813
the world will still be
better off for what I did.

351
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,181
Is that so?

352
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,850
Well, Brian, if you're
that sure of yourself,

353
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,852
then let's go five years
into the future,

354
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,687
and you can prove me wrong.
Fine.

355
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,000
Wow. This is
the future?

356
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,935
Everything
looks slicker.

357
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:33,770
Hey, Lois, I found some
double-sided tape.

358
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:35,739
I think I can do about
seven minutes worth

359
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,207
of funny stuff
with it.

360
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,976
That should get us to the
Meg kissing booth story.

361
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:41,545
Wow. Things have gotten
kind of lazy, huh?

362
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,846
Hey, Peter.

363
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:45,015
Thanks for letting me
borrow your screwdriver set.

364
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,484
You know, I just want to say
how nice it is

365
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:49,820
to be back here with y'all
on Spooner Street.

366
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:52,389
Oh, I guess things
didn't work out in Virginia.

367
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,625
Chris, I heard you got a
"D" on your report card.

368
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:55,959
Here's a cutaway.

369
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:58,762
Matthew McConaughey is terrible.

370
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,130
Good Lord!
What's happened to us?

371
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:01,765
Okay, maybe things
seem a little off,

372
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,667
but other than that,
the world seems okay.

373
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:05,102
Which proves my point.

374
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:07,704
Me stopping 9/11 led to a
world that's just fine.

375
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:09,806
Well, I'll see y'all tomorrow.

376
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,017
Brian, you might want
to look outside.

377
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:21,885
Oh, my God!

378
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,162
Oh, oh! Pebble in my shoe!

379
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,631
Pebble in my shoe.
Pebble in my shoe.

380
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,099
Nice work, Bri.

381
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,868
Whoops.

382
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:40,070
Well, at least Joe
gets to be a cyborg.

383
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:48,779
Freeze, Frogmire.

384
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,781
You are out past curfew,

385
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,517
and therefore, in violation
of local ordinance.

386
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:54,418
Ribbity.

387
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,259
What the hell happened?

388
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:06,361
Could I really have
caused all this?

389
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:08,530
It says here that the new
American civil war

390
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:10,632
you set into motion
ended up in a series

391
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,635
of concentrated nuclear strikes
all along the Eastern Seaboard.

392
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:16,037
It killed 17 million people.

393
00:15:16,105 --> 00:15:17,372
Oh.

394
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,007
- Including Cesar Millan.
- No!

395
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,875
Okay, okay, I get it--
Stewie, I screwed up.

396
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:22,510
All right? I shouldn't
have altered the past.

397
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:23,845
Is there anything
we can do?

398
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:25,914
Well, the only way
to fix this is to return

399
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:28,149
to the moment when we
first arrived in the past

400
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:30,485
and stop you from spilling
the beans about 9/11.

401
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:32,187
Okay. Okay,
let's do it.

402
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,394
Whoa, ass ahoy.

403
00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:40,795
All right, look,
there we are.

404
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:42,263
Hey, uh,
Peter, it's 7:00

405
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:43,698
and you've still
got your pants on.

406
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:44,633
What's the
occasion?

407
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Stop!
Both of you!

408
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:46,901
What the hell?
Who are you?

409
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:48,269
We're you,
from the future.

410
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:50,038
Oh, boy, this can't
be good news.

411
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:51,940
Who screwed up?
Take a wild guess.

412
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:54,009
- What did I do?
- Well, nothing yet, but listen.

413
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:55,577
Whatever you do,
you cannot tell

414
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:58,146
your former self--
that Brian-- about 9/11.

415
00:15:58,214 --> 00:16:01,216
If you do, America as you
know it will cease to exist.

416
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:02,450
My God, Brian.
What the hell?

417
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:03,652
We've been here
two minutes,

418
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,353
and already you've
destroyed America.

419
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,322
Okay, okay. I promise
I won't say anything.

420
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,358
Also, if you don't give
that Stewie a back rub,

421
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:12,160
it really messes
everything up.

422
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:16,464
All right,
can we go now?

423
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:22,771
Did that do it?

424
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:23,838
Did we restore
the past?

425
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:24,873
Well, let's check.

426
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,442
"9/11."

427
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,777
Oh, there it is.

428
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:30,111
We did it, Brian.

429
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:31,546
We made 9/11 happen.

430
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:32,881
High five! All right!
All right!

431
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,215
Yeah!
High five!

432
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:35,350
Wow, that...
that probably

433
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:37,085
wouldn't look very good
out of context.

434
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:39,688
There's the writer
of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series.

435
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:42,524
Must be weird hanging out
with us Muggles, huh, Brian?

436
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:43,525
Yeah.

437
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:45,293
Well, laundrium insertum.

438
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:46,661
Huh?

439
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:48,096
Oh, my God.

440
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:49,597
All right, you obviously
have no self-control,

441
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:52,000
so we've got to go back
and do this again.

442
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:55,470
Whoa, ass ahoy.

443
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:56,571
All right, let's go.

444
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,839
Hey, uh, Peter,
it's 7:00

445
00:16:57,907 --> 00:16:59,207
and you've still
got your pants on.

446
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:00,842
Oh, yeah, that's right.
We were just here.

447
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,310
Wait!

448
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:03,845
Who the devil
are you?

449
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:05,413
We're from the future.
So are we.

450
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:06,648
We're from
the further future.

451
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:07,916
We came to stop you.

452
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,217
Why?
What they did

453
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,052
actually turns out
to be damage-free.

454
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,854
It's what you're about to do--
stopping them--

455
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:14,689
that causes utter bedlam.

456
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:16,324
Oh, come on.

457
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:17,559
Wait!
Stop!

458
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:19,294
We're from the further
further future.

459
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,296
What you guys do
eventually works out.

460
00:17:21,363 --> 00:17:22,864
It's what you two
are about to do

461
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:24,265
that ruins everything!

462
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,467
Stop!
Don't do anything!

463
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:26,868
Oh, for
God's sake.

464
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:28,803
We're from the further
further further future.

465
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:30,371
What these two do
is fine.

466
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,796
It's what you two do
that makes things worse.

467
00:17:32,797 --> 00:17:33,864
- Stop!
- Wait!

468
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:34,509
- Hold it!
- Stop!

469
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,810
- Wait!
- No!

470
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:36,945
Hold it!
Stop!

471
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:38,113
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

472
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,080
I'm just looking
for the can.

473
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,448
- Don't move!
- Hold it!

474
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:41,449
- Freeze!
- Stop!

475
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:42,517
- Wait!
- No!

476
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:43,918
Oh, for God's sake, why?

477
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:45,286
This is why!

478
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:46,654
- Don't move!
- Hold it!

479
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:47,822
- Freeze!
- Stop!

480
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,224
- No!
- Wait!

481
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,326
Oh, my God.
What's that?

482
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:52,727
I don't know
what happened.

483
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,596
This is life
for some reason.

484
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:56,431
Don't do whatever
you're about to do.

485
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:57,799
God help us.

486
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,667
This is no
way to live.

487
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:06,074
No, don't do it!
Halt!

488
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:19,187
All right, everybody,
shut the hell up!

489
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:21,189
All right, this is (bleep),
all right?

490
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:22,757
I can't follow
what's going on anymore,

491
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:24,893
and I'm assuming
the rest of you can't, either.

492
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,861
So let's make this easy
and take a vote.

493
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:28,797
How many think
we should prevent 9/11?

494
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:31,266
Raise your hands.

495
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,134
One, two, three, four, five
six, seven, eight, nine...

496
00:18:33,202 --> 00:18:34,836
Okay, all right, looks like 42.

497
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:36,504
All right, who votes "yes 9/11?"

498
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:41,876
Okay, all right, 57.

499
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:43,111
All right, 9/11 wins.

500
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:44,746
Wait, wait, shouldn't it
be an even number?

501
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:46,214
Why is the total
an odd number?

502
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:48,349
Oh, yeah, I think one
of the Brians died.

503
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,285
What? What do you mean?
I don't know-- one of them

504
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:51,586
landed here
with its throat slit.

505
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:53,221
But wait,
if one of me is dead,

506
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:54,689
then shouldn't all
the me's be dead?

507
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:56,691
Brian, I-I don't...
I... it's...

508
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,159
I don't... I don't
know anymore. I-I...

509
00:18:58,227 --> 00:18:59,961
You know what?
I guess not. A-All right?

510
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:01,930
Okay, listen up--
everybody, get back

511
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:04,165
in your individual time machines
very carefully.

512
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,567
Nobody touch anything.

513
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:06,901
No <i>Harry Potter</i> novels.

514
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:08,403
Don't step on a bug.

515
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,405
Don't give earlier yous
investment advice.

516
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:12,841
Just go back to where you
came from, and stay there!

517
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:33,261
There.

518
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:34,629
Now, we're going
to do what we

519
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:36,030
should have done
in the first place.

520
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:37,532
Get on.

521
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:43,137
Wait a minute.
Isn't this where we just were?

522
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:44,272
Where are
the other two us's?

523
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,773
They're not here yet.

524
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:48,009
Just to make sure there are
absolutely no loose ends,

525
00:19:48,077 --> 00:19:49,911
I've sent us back in time
to the moment

526
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:52,013
just before you and I
originally arrived.

527
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:53,748
Why?
You'll see.

528
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:55,717
Get the (bleep) back
in your time machine!

529
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:57,085
Aah!
Who are you?

530
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:58,386
Never mind who I am!

531
00:19:58,454 --> 00:19:59,888
Just get back
in your time machine,

532
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:01,823
get back to the present,
and stay there!

533
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:03,725
Look, just calm down.
Aah!

534
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:05,627
You gonna flap your lips
or you gonna do what I said?

535
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:06,761
Okay, okay!

536
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,897
All right! God!

537
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:10,298
You just talked
to yourself.

538
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:11,499
Won't that
alter the past?

539
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,934
Don't worry, Brian.

540
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:15,003
If I was successful
in restoring the past just now,

541
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,771
you and I will never
have existed.

542
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,573
The chronological tangent
that created us

543
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:19,741
will have been erased.

544
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:21,676
Oh. Is it going to hurt?

545
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,645
Just a little.

546
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:25,280
Ow.

547
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:33,688
Oh, God, my leg
is killing me.

548
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:35,523
Well, time travel
is risky.

549
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,348
Every time you step
into that machine,

550
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,516
you invite the
possibility

551
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:40,351
of altering the
world as we know it.

552
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:41,719
Thankfully, the
alternate versions of us

553
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,254
were there to prevent
us from doing

554
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:44,556
whatever it is we
apparently did.

555
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,905
I wonder what it was.
We'll never know.

556
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,837
But look on the
bright side.

557
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:51,073
You might be sitting here
with a hole in your leg,

558
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:52,908
but at least our present
universe hasn't been affected.

559
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:54,577
Sorry, guys.
I'm gonna need the couch.

560
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,778
The gang and I
are gonna watch the game.

561
00:20:57,151 --> 00:20:59,771
All right, let's unplug
the TV and get going.
