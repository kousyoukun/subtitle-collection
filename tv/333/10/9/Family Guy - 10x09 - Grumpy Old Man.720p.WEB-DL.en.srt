12
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:36,515
Good morning.
I'm Tom Tucker.

13
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:38,850
Coming up, we talk
to a man on the street

14
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:41,486
while a man further back
on the street flips you off.

15
00:00:41,554 --> 00:00:44,055
But first, Quahog was hit by
a major blizzard last night.

16
00:00:44,123 --> 00:00:45,690
Here with more details
on the snowstorm

17
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:47,459
is Asian correspondent
Tricia Nakahoma.

18
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:49,461
That's wrong.
That's wrong.

19
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:51,429
You're not doing
good so far.

20
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:54,833
I'm standing here surrounded
by snowdrifts, stalled cars,

21
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,801
and the one douchebag
who wears a tank top

22
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:58,737
every time there's a blizzard.

23
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:00,138
Yeah, this is nothin'.

24
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:02,307
Guy at work drank a
quart of motor oil once

25
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,742
and didn't even
die from it.

26
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,560
Put that on the
news, but you won't.

27
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:09,998
Hey, guys, check it out.

28
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:11,883
I peed my name in the snow.

29
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,737
- Geez, Joe.
- That's normal.

30
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:17,839
Wow, looks like the whole
neighborhood's out here.

31
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,341
Yeah, I just hope
that weird albino

32
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:20,775
up the street doesn't show up.

33
00:01:20,843 --> 00:01:22,077
That guy creeps me out.

34
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:23,545
- Hello, Peter.
- Dah! Dah!

35
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:25,363
H-Hey. Hey, Bill.

36
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:27,449
What are you doing out
here in all this snow?

37
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,317
Just taking my rabbit
to the vet.

38
00:01:31,604 --> 00:01:34,239
Well, I'm all done shoveling
your walk, Mr. Herbert.

39
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:37,859
Thanks, Chris, but
there's some in here, too.

40
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:40,178
Hey, check
it out-- lemon snow.

41
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:41,863
- What?
- Yeah, that stuff's delicious.

42
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:44,733
Lemon snow? You mean it just
falls from the sky like that?

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,234
You bet. One of nature's treats.

44
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:48,136
- You gonna have some?
- Nah, I'm already full.

45
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:51,006
But you should have some before
the other kids get to it.

46
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:52,374
What is it?
Like Italian ice?

47
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,242
Yeah, exactly,
like a sorbet.

48
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:57,112
Ugh! That's not lemon!

49
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:58,780
- No, it's not.
- You bastard!

50
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:01,883
I was having fun playing in the
snow, and now you've ruined it,

51
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,585
like a pizza place
ruins a salad.

52
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:05,120
Okay, four pizzas
and a salad.

53
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:06,771
Salad? How do
you make a salad?

54
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:09,007
First, you throw in
the whole head of lettuce.

55
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:10,859
Even the hard-to-eat
white part at the bottom?

56
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:12,761
That's what the people want!
Now, what else?

57
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:14,546
I got a can of
whole black olives.

58
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:15,797
Should I slice them up?

59
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,899
What are you, crazy?
No, you keep 'em whole.

60
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,585
You're gonna want to know you've
got an olive in your mouth.

61
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:22,387
What about this tomato?
Cut it into thirds.

62
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:24,990
It should be big enough
to pretend you've got red teeth.

63
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,992
How about this carrot?
Should I cut it up?

64
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:28,376
Yes, but very thin lengthwise.

65
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:29,828
The whole length
of the carrot.

66
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:32,080
One thin slice.
Okay, what else do we got?

67
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:34,749
Well, we got these hot peppers,
but you can't really eat them.

68
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:36,301
No problem. Dump 'em all in.

69
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,086
Now, should we
put it in a bowl?

70
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:39,921
No, let's put it
in a lasagna tray.

71
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:41,323
Okay, great, I'll take it.

72
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,692
Oh, and make sure to stick it
right on top of the pizzas

73
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,427
so it stays nice and warm.

74
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:47,946
Hello, every pizza place.

75
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,485
All right, Stewie, you
all set to spend the day

76
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:54,769
with Grandma and Grandpa?

77
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,488
Ugh, I hate being around
old people.

78
00:02:56,555 --> 00:02:59,057
They've always got weird stuff
in their refrigerator.

79
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:00,959
Ah, I'm hungry.
What do we got?

80
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:03,928
Let's see. Eye drops,
baking soda and some film.

81
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:05,463
Close the door.

82
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,899
You're running up
long distance charges!

83
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:11,720
Ah, sorry.
Thought I had more time.

84
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,355
Hi, Daddy.
Stewie's all ready.

85
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:14,723
You boys have fun.

86
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,458

87

♪ Well, Grandpa's here. ♪

88

92

Let's go.

93
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,145
Hey, just so you know, we're not
listening to a radio station.

94
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:40,065
We're listening to the hiss
between two radio stations.

95
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:43,651
Whoa. Watch your driving!

96
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:47,438
Is he... Is he sleeping?

97
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,741
Hey! Hey, wake up! Wake up!

98
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,159
You, lady, wake him up!

99
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:53,461

do you, dear?

100
00:03:53,546 --> 00:03:55,780
Well, we'll dial them up
when we get home.

101
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:57,999
What the hell are you talking
about?! We're about to...

102
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,387
What happened?

103
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:04,189
Where are my
knitting needles?

104
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,127
Goodness, dear, I'm so sorry.

105
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:11,295
No worries.
Now I can work at Hot Topic

106
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:13,598
and make people sick
as I ring up their purchases.

107
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:23,992
Oh, damn it.

108
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,460
Dude, bad news.

109
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:26,728
You're dead.

110
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:28,546
What? But I'm Death!

111
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:30,148
Sorry, dude.
Super Death.

112
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:31,482
You're done.

113
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,251
So what now?
I go to Heaven?

114
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,553
Nope, when a Death dies,
he gets reincarnated.

115
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:39,624
You're being reincarnated as
a Chinese baby right... now!

116
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,895
- Girl?
- Girl.

117
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:46,564
Oh, no!

118
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:49,100
The egg that I was supposed
to take care of

119
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:50,668
for my high school project!

120
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:52,170
Mr. Burke was right.

121
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:54,272
I'm not ready to be a parent.

122
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,523
Wait a minute.

123
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:57,192
I'm not in high school anymore.

124
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,561
Maybe this is all a dream.

125
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:01,729
Aah! It <i>was</i> a dream!

126
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:03,698
I need a glass of water.

127
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:05,300
Wait a minute.

128
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:07,569
I moved out of the desert
years ago.

129
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:09,471
Maybe <i>this</i> is a dream!

130
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:11,306
Aah!

131
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:12,874
Phew.

132
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:15,410
I <i>am</i> ready
to be a parent, Mr. Burke.

133
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:21,483
Daddy, I'm so happy
you're all right.

134
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,351
We're lucky
it wasn't more serious.

135
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,503
Hey, how's
the old guy doing?

136
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:26,838
Ugh, now here's Joe.

137

Why is everybody
we know depressing?

138
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,743
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

139
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,812
I'm gonna have to revoke

takeover of a jelly factory.

158
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,343
I'll show those Smuckers.

159
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:24,646
That's fine,
but you can't drive.

160
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:26,080
Oh, don't be
ridiculous!

161
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:27,732
Driver Pete at
your service, sir.

162
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,467
- Peter, we're not doing that.
- Aw.

163
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,536
Carter, you work
too much as it is.

164
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:33,354
You're not a young
man anymore.

165
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,023
You need to slow down.

166
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,758
Slow down?! I
can't slow down.

167
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:38,426
I'm running a six-billion-
dollar company.

168
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:40,712
If I slow down, the
company goes under.

169
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,447
It just seems
to me that perhaps

170
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:45,183
it's time to think
about retirement.

171
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:47,085
Never! Retirement's
for old people.

172
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:48,720
I can work till I die.

173
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:50,104
Maybe even after that.

174
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:51,606
Mr. Pewterschmidt, the
gentlemen from Zurich

175
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:53,474
are here for your 10:00.

176
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:58,146
Will you need
anything else?

177
00:06:58,213 --> 00:07:00,231
Mr. Pewterschmidt!

178
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:02,467
But, dear, we <i>are</i> old.

179
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,986
We can't keep pretending
that nothing's changed.

180
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:07,622
I mean, we almost injured
our grandchild today.

181
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,457
Besides, you're always
complaining

182
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,893
that you don't have
enough time to play polo

183
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,662
or sit in a chair
and moisten your mouth.

184
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,197
That is true.

185
00:07:16,265 --> 00:07:18,917
It does sometimes take me
a while to moisten my mouth.

186
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:27,792
There we go, all moist.

187
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,227
You see, dear?

188
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:30,561
And that's only
the beginning.

189
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:32,847
Retirement will be
a wonderful adventure,

190
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:34,182
and we'll do it together.

191
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:35,483
You're gonna retire?

192
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:36,651
From what?

193
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:38,453
There, isn't it fun already?

194
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:42,490
Okay. I'll retire.

195
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:45,126
Oh, Daddy, I think
that's for the best.

196
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:47,562
I need a doctor!
Is there a doctor?!

197
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,842
We now return to
<i>The Superfriends' Accountant.</i>

198
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,611
Look, you guys
are hemorrhaging money.

199
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,813
This Hall of Justice is sitting
on five acres

200
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:01,847
of commercial real estate.

201
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,082
How do you afford this?

202
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,383
We're the Superfriends.

203
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,252
Yeah, but you guys
have no income.

204
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,587
You owe four million dollars
in back property taxes.

205
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,489
We fight evil
wherever we find it.

206
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,074
Well, that's not
gonna be enough.

207
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:13,776
Look, you may
need to reach out

208
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:15,928
to some wealthy benefactors
for financial backing.

209
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,863
Do any of you know
billionaire Bruce Wayne?

210
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,365
No. None of us do.

211
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,901
And he wouldn't want to lend
us money anyway... I hear.

212
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,435
Hey, hey, hey!

213
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,138
What's up, Ginas...
'g-'ginas... vaginas?

214
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,039
What's up,
vaginas?!

215
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,274
Ah-ha, gotcha!

216
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,959
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
what are you doing here?

217
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,795
I'm retired now. Got
a lot of free time.

218
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:34,513
So what do you guys
do here?

219
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,016
Well, we usually just sit here
and complain about our lives.

220
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,518
Like this morning, Lois was such
a pain in the ass...

221
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,687
Hey! That's my daughter
you're talking about!

222
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,556
Oh. I mean this, um,
redheaded lady

223
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,160
who lives in my bed was a real
pain in the ass this morning.

224
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,728
Oh, she sounds like a bitch.

225
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:50,896
Yeah, what a bitch.

226
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,097
Bitchazoid, right, guys?

227
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,666
Yeah. I hope you're doing her.

228
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,566
Oh, big time.

229
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,101
Yeah, that's hot.

230
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,770
That's hot. I'm gonna think
about that tonight.

231
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,822
Oh, we do all kinds
of crazy stuff.

232
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,624
Sometimes
we even have phone sax.

233
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:02,958
Don't you mean
phone <i>sex?</i>

234
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:04,526
No, Joe.
Phone <i>sax.</i>

235
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:05,894
Are you ready?

236
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,730
You better believe it.

237
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,648
(playing "Baker Street")

238
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,406
Oh, Peter!

239
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,575
Yeah. Now your turn.

240
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,377
And do it how I like.

241
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:23,662
Okay.

242
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:33,822
Yeah. Don't wash
the mouthpiece.

243
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:38,694
Good news, guys.

244
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:40,162
Now that Grandpa's retired,

245
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,298
he's gonna have more time
to spend with us.

246
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,332
Oh!

247
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,900
We don't want to do that, Mom.

248
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:46,986
Yeah, all he ever does is
ask you what you want to do

249
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,221
so he can shoot it down and
tell you what he wants to do.

250
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,389
Hey, there's
my family!

251
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,624
So, what do you guys
want to do today?

252
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,393
I'd like to go
to the mall, Grandpa.

253
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,627
No parking at the mall.

254
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,096
It's a terrible place.
What else?

255
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,197
Um, how about
the zoo?

256
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,598
Too much walking.
Too much noise.

257
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,000
You can't have
any good conversation.

258
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,234
Not like at Chili's.
Where else?

259
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,569
Well, there's always the beach.

260
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,771
No, you got to sit
on the ground to eat.

261
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,173
I need a cushioned chair with
back support like at Chili's.

262
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,559
Okay, well...
how about Chili's?

263
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,044
Maybe, maybe.

264
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,612
Let's get in the car
and see where it takes us.

265
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,584
Hey, Carter.

266
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,918
Hello, Quandary.

267
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,086
It's, uh...
It's Quagmire.

268
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,454
You looking for Peter?

269
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,889
No, he's at work. Lame.

270
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,407
Oh. Well, what
do you want?

271
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,276
I hear you're kind of
a cool guy.

272
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:28,761
Thought maybe
we could hang out.

273
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,162
Uh... okay.

274
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,997
Okay! Carter and Quandary,
hanging out.

275
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,367
All right, I just got to go take
a misty, stop-and-go piss

276
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,603
in your bathroom,
then we'll be good to go.

277
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,724
Lois, how the hell much
longer is your dad gonna

278
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:45,949
be hanging around here?

279
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,330
- He's starting to drive me crazy.
- I know, Peter,

280
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,816
but he's my father and I
don't know what else to do.

281
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,918
Well, I don't know how
much more I can take.

282
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,686
I can't even get
any sleep with him here.

283
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,990
Hey.

284
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,259
- Hey.
- Wha-Wha-Wha-Wha- What is it?

285
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,561
I can't sleep.
I'm scared of ghosts.

286
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,680
Carter, there's
no such thing as ghosts.

287
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,115
Are you sure?

288
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,450
Well, <i>now</i> I'm not.
Come on, get in here!

289
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:10,853
It's safe under
here, right?

290
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,588
I think so,
but I'm not sure.

291
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,823
I just recently started
believing in ghosts.

292
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,561
Hi, Mom. Hi, Daddy.

293
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:22,097
Lois! What are
you two doing here?

294
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,400
Well, we wanted to talk
to you about something.

295
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:25,701
Hmm. What's that?

296
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,169
Well, we were just thinking,

297
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:30,172
now that Daddy's retired
that you and he might be happier

298
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,142
in a place where you can be
with people your own age.

299
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:35,377
You know, make some new friends.

300
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,226
What are you talking about?

301
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:38,280
Well, we actually
brought you a few brochures

302
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,582
of some lovely retirement
communities in Florida.

303
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,184
And I helped.

304
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,285
Florida?!

305
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,421
Mm, this one's even
got the word "sunset"

306
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,289
four times in
the name of it.

307
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:49,858
Huh. These people are
biking without helmets.

308
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,794
Must be a pretty
kick-back place.

309
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:53,545
These actually
look quite nice,

310
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,915
and we could finally get away
from these dreadful winters.

311
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,984
Yeah. We'll even help you
move in and get settled.

312
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,336
Wait a minute, why would
I want to live in Florida?

313
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,205
Black people's votes go

314
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:04,656
All right!
We're moving to Florida!

315
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,092
Oh, Carter,
this is wonderful!

316
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,994
Aw, look at
that smile, Lois.

317
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,861
Reminds of that guy
who was way too happy he

318
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:12,549
didn't get killed on 9/11.

319
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,100
I'm ten minutes
late for work!

320
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,119
Look at that!
I stayed up late

321
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:19,655
watching <i>Monday Night Football</i>
and that saved my life, huh?

322
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:20,889
Isn't that awesome?

323
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,091
Oh, but oh...

324
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,167
Hi there. Welcome.

325
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,219
I'm Ryan, the manager
here at Oceanside,

326
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,054
and I'll be showing
you around today.

327
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,456
First question, though:

328
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,858
are you two old enough
to be here?

329
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,226
Oh, dear!

330
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,928
I like you, Ryan.

331
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:43,996
You're cool.

332
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:51,103
Over there is our statue
of Angela Lansbury.

333
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,008
Protect us, oh, Lansbury,
from rude teenagers,

334
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,111
from soup that is both
too hot and too cold,

335
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,414
and from anyone who calls,
but please have people call.

Why does everyone

You know, you remind
me of a guy I know.

00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,526
This guy worked and worked
and never wanted to retire,

the best thing for him.

- What?
- You're darn right what.

Looks like we got
a joker here.

Well, no!

Probably some

There's only one way
to win this game--

00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,833
wait for someone else to win

in your building
your office temperature

Yeah, I hated that.

Oh, that's perfect.

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,664
Now I'm cold.
Crank up the thermostat.

00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,967

Peter, I got to admit,
it's not bad at all.

445
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:17,049
Never thought I'd get
used to the idea

446
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:19,818
of giving up work and just
devoting my life to leisure.

447
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:22,571

mean by the word "relax."

You don't want
to meet those people.

452
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:33,615
Hi. I just moved
into the neighborhood,

453
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:37,119
and I'm required by law to inform
you that I am a sex offender.

Oh, don't worry
about it-- so am I.

455
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:40,756
This whole block
is S.O.'s.

456
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:43,825
We use the abbreviation "S.O's"
because it saves a lot of time

457
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:46,461
over saying "Sex Offender," because
that's all we talk about.

458
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,530
Well, I'm also into football.
Don't care.

459
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:51,166
No time for F.B.
All about S.O.

460
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:54,236
Make no mistake, Florida
is the South's trash can.

00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,676

Oh, my God!

469
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:16,575
Oh, my God, o-okay, we'll be
down there as soon as we can.

470
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:17,826
Mom, what's wrong?

471
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:19,261
We're going
to Florida.

472
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:20,629
Why? What happened?

473
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:22,831
There's something horribly wrong
with your grandpa.

474
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:30,105
Oh, Lois!

475
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:32,074
I'm so glad
you made it.

476
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:34,242
He's been like this for days.

477
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,944
Oh, my God!

478
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:38,647
...cream of wheat.

479
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:41,016
<i>...Jeopardy.</i>

480
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:44,186
...butterscotch pudding.

481
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:45,187
This is awful!

482
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:46,655
What's happened to him?

483
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:48,390
I don't know, dear.

484
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,626
He sleeps 18 hours a day,
he refuses to bathe,

485
00:18:51,694 --> 00:18:53,729
and he's stopped
making any sense.

486
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:55,492
Aw, that sounds like
the sad little fat girl

487
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,117
who lives in all of us

488
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,500
and is struggling
to get out.

489
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:02,037
Did my parents
call yet?

490
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,972
Nobody's looking for you!
Now, stay in there!

491
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,141
Sometimes she tries
to get out the other way.

492
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:08,243
That's why I keep
a cork in my bum.

493
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:09,745
Daddy?

494
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:11,847
Daddy, can you hear me?

495
00:19:11,914 --> 00:19:14,249
Oh, God, we should never
have brought him here.

496
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:15,450
You're right, dear.

497
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:17,919
I can't stand
to see him like this.

498
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:19,454
Well, we got
to do something.

499
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:22,224
Don't worry, you guys, I think
I might know how to fix this.

500
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,327
But first look-- I turned
him into Groucho Marx.

501
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:27,662
That's hilarious.

502
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,351
Peter, what is this
supposed to accomplish?

503
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:35,554
Don't you see, Lois?
When we forced him to retire,

504
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,456
we took all the challenge
out of his life.

505
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:40,125
Perhaps some people aren't
meant to retire at all.

506
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:43,411
Exactly! Now, let's see if we
can put some fire back into him.

507
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:46,498
Margot, it's time to take this
company in a new direction--

508
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:49,351
starting with being honest with
the IRS about our profits.

509
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:54,005
We're also gonna stop
reading employee e-mails.

510
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,441
<i>...our</i> servers.

511
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:58,276
And from now on it's
against the rules

512
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:00,462
to pat female employees
on the fanny.

513
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,315
...like touching butts!

514
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:05,383
And tell the African-American
elevator attendant

515
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,252
he no longer has to
wear white gloves.

516
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,405
Why don't you just tell him
he can sleep with my wife, too?!

517
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,490
Daddy!

518
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:12,941
Oh, Carter!
You're back!

519
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:14,726
You're damn
right I am!

520
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:16,539
Don't you ever try to
stick me in one of those

521
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:18,176
retirement places again!

522
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:22,100
I plan on sitting behind this desk
until the day I die.

523
00:20:22,168 --> 00:20:24,136
Getting old is right
for some people,

524
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:26,471
but not for me.
- I know, Daddy.

525
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,590
You were right,
and we're sorry.

526
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,093
Hey, Mom.

527
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:34,529
No, Mom, you're staying
in the nursing home.

528
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:36,598
I... I don't care.

529
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,200
I-I don't care.

530
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:40,936
M-Mom, believe me, no one
is touching you in your sleep.

531
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:42,437
'Cause you're gross.

532
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:44,222
And even if they are, so what,
who are you saving yourself for?

533
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:48,532
Hey, look, I-I got to go.
I don't know if we're coming

534
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:51,017
to Thanksgiving.
Because I don't know!

535
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,931
- She's staying in there.
- I know.
