12
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:36,534
Good morning.
I'm Tom Tucker.

13
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,869
Coming up, we talk
to a man on the street

14
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:41,505
while a man further back
on the street flips you off.

15
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:44,074
But first, Quahog was hit by
a major blizzard last night.

16
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:45,709
Here with more details
on the snowstorm

17
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,478
is Asian correspondent
Tricia Nakahoma.

18
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,480
That's wrong.
That's wrong.

19
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:51,448
You're not doing
good so far.

20
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:54,852
I'm standing here surrounded
by snowdrifts, stalled cars,

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,820
and the one douchebag
who wears a tank top

22
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:58,756
every time there's a blizzard.

23
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:00,157
Yeah, this is nothin'.

24
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:02,326
Guy at work drank a
quart of motor oil once

25
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:03,761
and didn't even
die from it.

26
00:01:03,828 --> 00:01:05,579
Put that on the
news, but you won't.

27
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:07,514
(laughter and excited chatter)

28
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:10,017
Hey, guys, check it out.

29
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,902
I peed my name in the snow.

30
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:15,756
- Geez, Joe.
- That's normal.

31
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:17,858
Wow, looks like the whole
neighborhood's out here.

32
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:19,360
Yeah, I just hope
that weird albino

33
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:20,794
up the street doesn't show up.

34
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:22,096
That guy creeps me out.

35
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:23,564
- Hello, Peter.
- Dah! Dah!

36
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:25,382
H-Hey. Hey, Bill.

37
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,468
What are you doing out
here in all this snow?

38
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,336
Just taking my rabbit
to the vet.

39
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:34,258
Well, I'm all done shoveling
your walk, Mr. Herbert.

40
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:37,878
Thanks, Chris, but
there's some in here, too.

41
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:40,197
BRIAN: Hey, check
it out-- lemon snow.

44
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,253
You bet. One of nature's treats.

45
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,155
- You gonna have some?
- Nah, I'm already full.

46
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:51,025
But you should have some before
the other kids get to it.

47
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:52,393
What is it?
Like Italian ice?

48
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,261
Yeah, exactly,
like a sorbet.

49
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:57,131
Ugh! That's not lemon!

50
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:58,799
- No, it's not.
- You bastard!

51
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:01,902
I was having fun playing in the
snow, and now you've ruined it,

52
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,604
like a pizza place
ruins a salad.

53
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:05,139
Okay, four pizzas
and a salad.

54
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:06,790
Salad? How do
you make a salad?

55
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:09,026
First, you throw in
the whole head of lettuce.

56
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:10,878
Even the hard-to-eat
white part at the bottom?

57
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:12,780
That's what the people want!
Now, what else?

58
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:14,565
I got a can of
whole black olives.

59
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:15,816
Should I slice them up?

60
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:17,918
What are you, crazy?
No, you keep 'em whole.

61
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,604
You're gonna want to know you've
got an olive in your mouth.

62
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,406
What about this tomato?
Cut it into thirds.

63
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:25,009
It should be big enough
to pretend you've got red teeth.

64
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:27,011
How about this carrot?
Should I cut it up?

65
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:28,395
Yes, but very thin lengthwise.

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,847
The whole length
of the carrot.

67
00:02:29,914 --> 00:02:32,099
One thin slice.
Okay, what else do we got?

68
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:34,768
Well, we got these hot peppers,
but you can't really eat them.

69
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:36,320
No problem. Dump 'em all in.

70
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:38,105
Now, should we
put it in a bowl?

71
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:39,940
No, let's put it
in a lasagna tray.

72
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:41,342
Okay, great, I'll take it.

73
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,711
Oh, and make sure to stick it
right on top of the pizzas

74
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,446
so it stays nice and warm.

75
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:46,497
(phone ringing)

76
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:47,965
Hello, every pizza place.

77
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,504
All right, Stewie, you
all set to spend the day

78
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:54,788
with Grandma and Grandpa?

79
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:56,507
Ugh, I hate being around
old people.

80
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:59,076
They've always got weird stuff
in their refrigerator.

81
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:00,978
Ah, I'm hungry.
What do we got?

82
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,947
Let's see. Eye drops,
baking soda and some film.

83
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:05,482
OLD MAN:
Close the door.

84
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,918
You're running up
long distance charges!

85
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:09,887
(doorbell rings)

86
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:11,739
Ah, sorry.
Thought I had more time.

87
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:13,374
Hi, Daddy.
Stewie's all ready.

88
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:14,742
You boys have fun.

89
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,477
There's my little guy.

90
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:19,146
♪ Well, Grandpa's here. ♪

91
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:20,848
Oh, God, it's
the song again.

92
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:22,199
♪ Yes, Grandpa's here! ♪

93
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:24,084
It doesn't even
rhyme at all.

94
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:27,554
♪ He's going to buy you a soda
and drive you around. ♪

95
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:28,989

96
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,794
(radio static)

97
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,164
Hey, just so you know, we're not
listening to a radio station.

98
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:40,084
We're listening to the hiss
between two radio stations.

99
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:41,752
(tires squealing)

100
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:43,670
Whoa. Watch your driving!

101
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:47,457

102
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,760
Hey! Hey, wake up! Wake up!

103
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:51,178
You, lady, wake him up!

104
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,480
You like the <i>Tom and Jerry,</i>
do you, dear?

105
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,799
Well, we'll dial them up
when we get home.

106
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,018
What the hell are you talking
about?! We're about to...

107
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:01,171
(groans)

108
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,406
What happened?

109
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:04,208
Where are my
knitting needles?

110
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:09,146
(gasps)
Goodness, dear, I'm so sorry.

111
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:11,314
No worries.
Now I can work at Hot Topic

112
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:13,617
and make people sick
as I ring up their purchases.

113
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:15,502
(tires screeching)

114
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:24,011
Oh, damn it.

115
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,479
Dude, bad news.

116
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:26,747
You're dead.

117
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:28,565
What? But I'm Death!

118
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,167
Sorry, dude.
Super Death.

119
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:31,501
You're done.

120
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:33,270
So what now?
I go to Heaven?

121
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:35,572
Nope, when a Death dies,
he gets reincarnated.

122
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,643
You're being reincarnated as
a Chinese baby right... now!

123
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:42,112
(whirring)

124
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,914
- Girl?
- Girl.

125
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,583
Oh, no!

126
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:49,119
The egg that I was supposed
to take care of

127
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:50,687
for my high school project!

128
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,189
Mr. Burke was right.

129
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:54,291
I'm not ready to be a parent.

130
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,542
Wait a minute.

131
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,211
I'm not in high school anymore.

132
00:04:57,278 --> 00:04:59,580
Maybe this is all a dream.

133
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:01,748
Aah! It <i>was</i> a dream!

134
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,717
I need a glass of water.

135
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,319
Wait a minute.

136
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:07,588
I moved out of the desert
years ago.

137
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,490
Maybe <i>this</i> is a dream!

138
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:11,325
Aah!

139
00:05:11,392 --> 00:05:12,893
Phew.

140
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:15,429
I <i>am</i> ready
to be a parent, Mr. Burke.

141
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:21,502
Daddy, I'm so happy
you're all right.

142
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,370
We're lucky
it wasn't more serious.

143
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:25,522
Hey, how's
the old guy doing?

144
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:26,857
Ugh, now here's Joe.

145
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,992
Why is everybody
we know depressing?

146
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,762
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

147
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,831
I'm gonna have to revoke
your driver's license.

What?!

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,534
It's obvious your advanced age

to drive safely.

151
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:41,071
Please, Joe, I know he had
an accident,

152
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,739
but can't you look the
other way

this one time
as a friend?

154
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:46,443
Yeah, you know, Joe,
you owe this family.

155
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,479

just because she can. ♪

161
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:12,119
I'm brok.
(door rattling)

162
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,004
BONNIE:
Joe, open the garage.

163
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:16,540
I've earned this private time!

164
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:18,275
Listen, I don't
have time for this.

165
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:20,527
I'm late for a hostile
takeover of a jelly factory.

166
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:22,362
I'll show those Smuckers.

167
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,665
That's fine,
but you can't drive.

168
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,099
Oh, don't be
ridiculous!

169
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,751
Driver Pete at
your service, sir.

170
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,486
- Peter, we're not doing that.
- Aw.

171
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:31,555
Carter, you work
too much as it is.

172
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:33,373
You're not a young
man anymore.

173
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,042
You need to slow down.

174
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:36,777
Slow down?! I
can't slow down.

175
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,445
I'm running a six-billion-
dollar company.

176
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:40,731
If I slow down, the
company goes under.

177
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:42,466
It just seems
to me that perhaps

178
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:45,202
it's time to think
about retirement.

179
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,104
Never! Retirement's
for old people.

180
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,739
I can work till I die.

181
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:50,123
Maybe even after that.

182
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:51,625
Mr. Pewterschmidt, the
gentlemen from Zurich

183
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:53,493
are here for your 10:00.

184
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,165
Will you need
anything else?

185
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:00,250
Mr. Pewterschmidt!

186
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:02,486
But, dear, we <i>are</i> old.

187
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:05,005
We can't keep pretending
that nothing's changed.

188
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:07,641
I mean, we almost injured
our grandchild today.

189
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,476
Besides, you're always
complaining

190
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:11,912
that you don't have
enough time to play polo

191
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,681
or sit in a chair
and moisten your mouth.

192
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:16,216
That is true.

193
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:18,936
It does sometimes take me
a while to moisten my mouth.

194
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,811
There we go, all moist.

195
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,246
You see, dear?

196
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:30,580
And that's only
the beginning.

197
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,866
Retirement will be
a wonderful adventure,

198
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:34,201
and we'll do it together.

199
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:35,502
You're gonna retire?

200
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,670
From what?

201
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:38,472
There, isn't it fun already?

202
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:39,806
(sighs)

203
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:42,509
Okay. I'll retire.

204
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:45,145
Oh, Daddy, I think
that's for the best.

205
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,581
I need a doctor!
Is there a doctor?!

206
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:56,861
ANNOUNCER: We now return to
<i>The Superfriends' Accountant.</i>

207
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,630
Look, you guys
are hemorrhaging money.

208
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:00,832
This Hall of Justice is sitting
on five acres

209
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,866
of commercial real estate.

210
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:03,101
How do you afford this?

211
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:04,402
We're the Superfriends.

212
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,271
Yeah, but you guys
have no income.

213
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:08,606
You owe four million dollars
in back property taxes.

214
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:10,508
We fight evil
wherever we find it.

215
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:12,093
Well, that's not
gonna be enough.

216
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:13,795
Look, you may
need to reach out

217
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:15,947
to some wealthy benefactors
for financial backing.

218
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:17,882
Do any of you know
billionaire Bruce Wayne?

219
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,384
No. None of us do.

220
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:21,920
And he wouldn't want to lend
us money anyway... I hear.

221
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:23,454
Hey, hey, hey!

222
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:26,157
What's up, Ginas...
'g-'ginas... vaginas?

223
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:27,058
What's up,
vaginas?!

224
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:28,293
Ah-ha, gotcha!

225
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,978
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
what are you doing here?

226
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:32,814
I'm retired now. Got
a lot of free time.

227
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,532
So what do you guys
do here?

228
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:37,035
Well, we usually just sit here
and complain about our lives.

229
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:39,537
Like this morning, Lois was such
a pain in the ass...

230
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:41,706
Hey! That's my daughter
you're talking about!

231
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:44,575
Oh. I mean this, um,
redheaded lady

232
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:48,179
who lives in my bed was a real
pain in the ass this morning.

233
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:49,747
Oh, she sounds like a bitch.

234
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:50,915
Yeah, what a bitch.

235
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:52,116
Bitchazoid, right, guys?

236
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:53,685
Yeah. I hope you're doing her.

237
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:54,585
Oh, big time.

238
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,120
Yeah, that's hot.

239
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:57,789
That's hot. I'm gonna think
about that tonight.

240
00:08:57,856 --> 00:08:59,841
Oh, we do all kinds
of crazy stuff.

241
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:01,643
Sometimes
we even have phone sax.

242
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,977
Don't you mean
phone <i>sex?</i>

243
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:04,545
No, Joe.
Phone <i>sax.</i>

244
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:05,913
Are you ready?

245
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:07,749
You better believe it.

246
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:09,667
(playing "Baker Street")

247
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:17,425
Oh, Peter!

248
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:19,594
Yeah. Now your turn.

249
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:21,396
And do it how I like.

250
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,681
(giggles)
Okay.

251
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:25,616
(playing intro to
"You Can Call Me Al")

252
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:33,841
Yeah. Don't wash
the mouthpiece.

253
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:38,713
Good news, guys.

254
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:40,181
Now that Grandpa's retired,

255
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:42,317
he's gonna have more time
to spend with us.

256
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:43,351
ALL:
Oh!

257
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:44,919
We don't want to do that, Mom.

258
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:47,005
Yeah, all he ever does is
ask you what you want to do

259
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:49,240
so he can shoot it down and
tell you what he wants to do.

260
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:50,408
Hey, there's
my family!

261
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:52,643
So, what do you guys
want to do today?

262
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:54,412
I'd like to go
to the mall, Grandpa.

263
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,646
No parking at the mall.

264
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:57,115
It's a terrible place.
What else?

265
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,216
Um, how about
the zoo?

266
00:09:58,283 --> 00:09:59,617
Too much walking.
Too much noise.

267
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:01,019
You can't have
any good conversation.

268
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:02,253
Not like at Chili's.
Where else?

269
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,588
Well, there's always the beach.

270
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:05,790
No, you got to sit
on the ground to eat.

271
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:08,192
I need a cushioned chair with
back support like at Chili's.

272
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,578
Okay, well...
how about Chili's?

273
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:12,063
Maybe, maybe.

274
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:13,631
Let's get in the car
and see where it takes us.

275
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,168
(rings doorbell)

276
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:18,603
Hey, Carter.

277
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,937
Hello, Quandary.

278
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:21,105
It's, uh...
It's Quagmire.

279
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:22,473
You looking for Peter?

280
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,908
No, he's at work. Lame.

281
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:25,426
Oh. Well, what
do you want?

282
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:27,295
I hear you're kind of
a cool guy.

283
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:28,780
Thought maybe
we could hang out.

284
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,181
Uh... okay.

285
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:32,016
Okay! Carter and Quandary,
hanging out.

286
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:35,386
All right, I just got to go take
a misty, stop-and-go piss

287
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:37,622
in your bathroom,
then we'll be good to go.

288
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:44,743
Lois, how the hell much
longer is your dad gonna

289
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:45,968
be hanging around here?

290
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:48,349
- He's starting to drive me crazy.
- (sighs) I know, Peter,

291
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,835
but he's my father and I
don't know what else to do.

292
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:52,937
Well, I don't know how
much more I can take.

293
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,705
I can't even get
any sleep with him here.

294
00:10:56,642 --> 00:10:58,009
Hey.

295
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,278
- Hey.
- Wha-Wha-Wha-Wha- What is it?

296
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:02,580
I can't sleep.
I'm scared of ghosts.

297
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,699
Carter, there's
no such thing as ghosts.

298
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,134
Are you sure?

299
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:08,469
Well, <i>now</i> I'm not.
Come on, get in here!

300
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:10,872
It's safe under
here, right?

301
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,607
I think so,
but I'm not sure.

302
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,842
I just recently started
believing in ghosts.

303
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,580
Hi, Mom. Hi, Daddy.

304
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:22,116
Lois! What are
you two doing here?

305
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:24,419
Well, we wanted to talk
to you about something.

306
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:25,720
Hmm. What's that?

307
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,188
Well, we were just thinking,

308
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:30,191
now that Daddy's retired
that you and he might be happier

309
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,161
in a place where you can be
with people your own age.

310
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:35,396
You know, make some new friends.

311
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:36,245
What are you talking about?

312
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,299
Well, we actually
brought you a few brochures

313
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,601
of some lovely retirement
communities in Florida.

314
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:42,203
And I helped.

315
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:43,304
Florida?!

316
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,440
Mm, this one's even
got the word "sunset"

317
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:47,308
four times in
the name of it.

318
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:49,877
Huh. These people are
biking without helmets.

319
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:51,813
Must be a pretty
kick-back place.

320
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,564
These actually
look quite nice,

321
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:56,934
and we could finally get away
from these dreadful winters.

322
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:59,003
Yeah. We'll even help you
move in and get settled.

323
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:01,355
Wait a minute, why would
I want to live in Florida?

324
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,224
Black people's votes go
right in the garbage.

325
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,675
All right!
We're moving to Florida!

326
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:07,111
Oh, Carter,
this is wonderful!

327
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,013
Aw, look at
that smile, Lois.

328
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,880
Reminds of that guy
who was way too happy he

329
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:12,568
didn't get killed on 9/11.

330
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:15,119
(gasping): I'm ten minutes
late for work!

331
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:17,138
Look at that!
I stayed up late

332
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:19,674
watching <i>Monday Night Football</i>
and that saved my life, huh?

333
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:20,908
Isn't that awesome?

334
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:23,110
Oh, but oh...

335
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:32,186
Hi there. Welcome.

336
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:34,238
I'm Ryan, the manager
here at Oceanside,

337
00:12:34,306 --> 00:12:36,073
and I'll be showing
you around today.

338
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:37,475
First question, though:

339
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:39,877
are you two old enough
to be here?

340
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,245
(giggles):
Oh, dear!

341
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:42,947
(laughs)
I like you, Ryan.

342
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:44,015
You're cool.

343
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:51,122
Over there is our statue
of Angela Lansbury.

344
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:56,027
Protect us, oh, Lansbury,
from rude teenagers,

345
00:12:56,094 --> 00:12:59,130
from soup that is both
too hot and too cold,

346
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,433
and from anyone who calls,
but please have people call.

347
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,871
Our state-of-the-art movie
theater is equipped

348

including a button on every seat
that will pause the film

350

has a question.

There's no way in hell
I'm gonna live here!

371
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:58,239
This place is nothing but old
people marching to their deaths!

You hear me?
I'm not one of you!

the guy who owns
the amusement park!

But let's see who's
<i>really</i> under there.

(screams)
(gasps)

378
00:14:12,254 --> 00:14:13,421
A skeleton!

379
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:15,523
- Can I have my face back?
- No!

380
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:16,958
You're going to jail!

381
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:25,903
Oh, this is dreadful.

382
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,672
I thought Carter and I were
going to be so happy here.

383
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,108
I'll tell you what, Babs,
let me have a talk with him.

384
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,610
Hey there, buddy.

385
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:34,878
Go away!

386
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:37,814
You know, you remind
me of a guy I know.

387
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:40,651
This guy worked and worked
and never wanted to retire,

388
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:43,420
even though it would've been
the best thing for him.

389
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:45,422
You know what that
man's name was?

390
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,324
Jon Benet Ramsey.

391
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:49,893
I-I-I think.

392
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:51,495
I think that's the guy.

393
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:53,397
- What?
- You're darn right what.

394
00:14:53,464 --> 00:14:55,232
Now, let's get
back in there.

395
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,901
Peter, get lost! I'm not gonna
retire, and that's that!

396
00:14:57,969 --> 00:15:00,537
Come on, Carter, everybody's
got to retire at some point.

397
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:02,572
Like that drill sergeant
with Alzheimer's.

398
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,575
Looks like we got
a joker here.

399
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:06,910
What's your
name, soldier?

400
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:08,378
Sir, McArdle, sir!

401
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:09,646
Well, no (bleep)!

402
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:12,149
You look like some
kind of joker to me.

403
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:13,250
What's your
name, soldier?

404
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:14,718
Sir, McArdle, sir!

405
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,620
Are you (bleep) me?

406
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,255
Probably some
kind of joker.

407
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:19,623
What's your
name, soldier?

408
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:20,991
Sir, McArdle, sir!

409
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,793
Well, la-dee (bleep) da!

410
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,796
I guess we got some
kind of joker here!

411
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,998
Look, Carter, I'll
make a deal with you.

412
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,146
You give me just one day
to show you how great retired

413
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:31,611
life can be for an old fella,

414
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:34,338
and I'll let you honk
the horn one time.

415
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,039
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

416
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:37,541

417
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,376

there's traffic.

418
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:40,777
There you go, that's...

419
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:43,347
- Once!
- God, I wasn't even gonna do it!

420
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:47,701
So, how do you
win this game?

421
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:49,936
Just fill this out when they
say the letter and the numbers?

422
00:15:50,004 --> 00:15:51,104
Eh, that's a sucker's bet.

423
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:52,856
There's only one way
to win this game--

424
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:54,958
wait for someone else to win
and steal his card.

425

- What do we do, sneak up behind him?

428
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,516
No, he's got cataracts.
Follow my lead.

in your building
your office temperature

442
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:41,955
was controlled
by a central air system

443
00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:44,524
that you had nothing to do with?
Yeah, I hated that.

Well, check it out-- this room
has its very own thermostat

445
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:48,495
that you can fiddle with.
- Really?

446
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:50,113
I can change the
temperature in here?

447
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:52,082
You're retired-- you
can do anything you want.

448
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,317
Well, I am kind of warm.
I'll try it out.

449
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:56,136
Oh, that's perfect.

450
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:58,789
Now I'm cold.
Crank up the thermostat.

451
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:00,457
Ah, wonderful.

452
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,092
Hotter than
blazes in here.

453
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,444

We'll be down

457
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:13,019
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I'm glad you
finally came around about this place.

458
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:15,305
Peter, I got to admit,
it's not bad at all.

459
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:17,174
Never thought I'd get
used to the idea

460
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:19,943
of giving up work and just
devoting my life to leisure.

461
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:22,696
I guess this is what people
mean by the word "relax."

462
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:23,897
Take care, dear.

463
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:25,866
We'll see you soon.
Yeah, have fun.

464
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:28,401
Just remember not to go out
into actual Florida.

465
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:30,337
You don't want
to meet those people.

466
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:31,671
(doorbell rings)

467
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:33,740
Hi. I just moved
into the neighborhood,

468
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:37,244
and I'm required by law to inform
you that I am a sex offender.

469
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:39,246
Oh, don't worry
about it-- so am I.

We use the abbreviation "S.O's"
because it saves a lot of time

472
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:46,586
over saying "Sex Offender," because
that's all we talk about.

473
00:17:46,654 --> 00:17:48,655
Well, I'm also into football.
Don't care.

474
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:51,291
No time for F.B.
All about S.O.

475
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,361
Make no mistake, Florida
is the South's trash can.

476
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,801
Boy, these eggs
are delicious.

477
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:02,135
Good job, Lois.

478
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:03,854
Good job, local hen.

479
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:05,722
Aw, bucka bucka baw.

480
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,657
(phone rings)

481
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:09,259
Hello?

482
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:10,694
Hi, Mom.

483
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:11,862
What?

484
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:13,530
Oh, my God!

485
00:18:13,598 --> 00:18:16,700
Oh, my God, o-okay, we'll be
down there as soon as we can.

486
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:17,951
Mom, what's wrong?

487
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,386
We're going
to Florida.

488
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:20,754
Why? What happened?

489
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:22,956
There's something horribly wrong
with your grandpa.

490
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:30,230
Oh, Lois!

491
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:32,199
I'm so glad
you made it.

492
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:34,367
He's been like this for days.

493
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:36,069
Oh, my God!

494
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:37,270
(grumbling)

495
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:38,772
...cream of wheat.

496
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,040
(mumbling)

497
00:18:40,107 --> 00:18:41,141
<i>...Jeopardy.</i>

498
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,709
(mumbling)

499
00:18:42,777 --> 00:18:44,311
...butterscotch pudding.

500
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:45,312
This is awful!

501
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:46,780
What's happened to him?

502
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:48,515
I don't know, dear.

503
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,751
He sleeps 18 hours a day,
he refuses to bathe,

504
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,854
and he's stopped
making any sense.

505
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:55,617
Aw, that sounds like
the sad little fat girl

506
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:57,242
who lives in all of us

507
00:18:57,325 --> 00:18:58,625
and is struggling
to get out.

508
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:00,393
(muffled grunts)

509
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:02,162
Did my parents
call yet?

510
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,097
Nobody's looking for you!
Now, stay in there!

511
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:06,266
Sometimes she tries
to get out the other way.

512
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:08,368
That's why I keep
a cork in my bum.

513
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:09,870
Daddy?

514
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:11,972
Daddy, can you hear me?

515
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,374
Oh, God, we should never
have brought him here.

516
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:15,575
You're right, dear.

517
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:18,044
I can't stand
to see him like this.

518
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,579
Well, we got
to do something.

519
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:22,349
Don't worry, you guys, I think
I might know how to fix this.

520
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,452
But first look-- I turned
him into Groucho Marx.

521
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,787
That's hilarious.

522
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,476
Peter, what is this
supposed to accomplish?

523
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:35,679
Don't you see, Lois?
When we forced him to retire,

524
00:19:35,746 --> 00:19:37,581
we took all the challenge
out of his life.

525
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:40,250
Perhaps some people aren't
meant to retire at all.

526
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:43,536
Exactly! Now, let's see if we
can put some fire back into him.

527
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:46,623
Margot, it's time to take this
company in a new direction--

528
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:49,476
starting with being honest with
the IRS about our profits.

529
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:51,628
(mumbling)

530
00:19:51,696 --> 00:19:54,130
We're also gonna stop
reading employee e-mails.

531
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:56,566
(mumbling)
<i>...our</i> servers.

532
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:58,401
And from now on it's
against the rules

533
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:00,587
to pat female employees
on the fanny.

534
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:03,440
(mumbling):
...like touching butts!

535
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:05,508
And tell the African-American
elevator attendant

536
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:07,377
he no longer has to
wear white gloves.

537
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:10,530
Why don't you just tell him
he can sleep with my wife, too?!

538
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:11,615
Daddy!

539
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:13,066
Oh, Carter!
You're back!

540
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:14,851
You're damn
right I am!

541
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:16,664
Don't you ever try to
stick me in one of those

542
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:18,301
retirement places again!

543
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:22,225
I plan on sitting behind this desk
until the day I die.

544
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:24,261
Getting old is right
for some people,

545
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:26,596
but not for me.
- I know, Daddy.

546
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:28,715
You were right,
and we're sorry.

547
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:30,717
(phone rings)

548
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:32,218
Hey, Mom.

549
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:34,654
No, Mom, you're staying
in the nursing home.

550
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:36,723
I... I don't care.

551
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,325
I-I don't care.

552
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:41,061
M-Mom, believe me, no one
is touching you in your sleep.

553
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:42,562
'Cause you're gross.

554
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,347
And even if they are, so what,
who are you saving yourself for?

555
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,657
Hey, look, I-I got to go.
I don't know if we're coming

556
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:51,142
to Thanksgiving.
Because I don't know!

557
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:54,056
- She's staying in there.
- I know.

558
