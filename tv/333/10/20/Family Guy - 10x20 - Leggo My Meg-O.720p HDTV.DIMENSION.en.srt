12
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:34,916
All right, ladies,

13
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:36,735
let's pick teams
for dodgeball.

14
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:37,736
Connie, would you like
to be a captain?

15
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:38,837
Sure.

16
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,839
I pick everyone
except Meg.

17
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,540
Fair enough. Go!

18
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,312
Oww!

19
00:00:57,356 --> 00:00:59,124
Hey, where's
everybody going?

20
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,126
That's not how we end
this class.

21
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:03,836
Good job today.

22
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:05,070
Good job today.

23
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:06,396
Great class.

24
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:07,480
Nice hustle.

25
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:12,641
Hey, how was gym class?

26
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:13,431
Terrible.

27
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:14,465
You know, I don't think
I can take

28
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,516
another semester
at this school, Ruth.

29
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:17,018
It's torture.

30
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:19,787
It's worse than sitting
next to a baby on an airplane.

31
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,657
So what brings you
to Kentucky?

32
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:23,891
I'm visiting my family.

33
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,526
Ah, family man.

34
00:01:25,594 --> 00:01:27,995
Me? Single
and ready to mingle.

35
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:30,865
Tom Brunell's the name.
Insurance is the game.

36
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,635
And right now,
the game is <i>very</i> good to me.

37
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:35,853
Hey, I know!

38
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:36,954
If you hate it
so much here,

39
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:38,055
why don't you
come to Paris

40
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:39,440
for a semester
with me instead?

41
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:40,625
I'm leaving next week.

42
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,426
You're going to Paris
for a semester?

43
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:44,495
Yeah, it's a program
sponsored by the high school.

44
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,163
My aunt even has
an apartment there

45
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,665
that we can stay in
for free.

46
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,134
Oh, my God,
that sounds so amazing!

47
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:51,652
Excuse me,
I was wondering

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,222
if you would go to the dance
with me on Friday.

49
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:55,773
Chris, it's me, Meg.

50
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:57,808
Well, that's everybody.

51
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,549
We now return
to <i>Ethiopian Hoarders.</i>

52
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:08,753
I don't know
how it got like this!

53
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,321
Dad, Mom,

54
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,756
there's something
I want to ask you.

55
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:12,990
Can I go to school
in Paris

56
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:13,991
for a semester?

57
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,426
What? Paris?

58
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:17,228
Hey, you know,
I have a pen pal in Paris.

59
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,679
Would you mind bringing him
this letter?

60
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:21,983
We're fighting.

61
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,502
Meg, I'd love to send you
to Paris for a semester,

62
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:25,920
but we can't afford that.

63
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:27,188
But I can pay
for it myself.

64
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:28,956
I've been saving up
from all my part-time jobs.

65
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,358
That's smart of you, Meg.

66
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:31,559
You know, sometimes I do

67
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:33,728
part-time jobs
for extra cash.

68
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,747
Gimme money. Gimme money.

69
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:38,798
Gimme money. Gimme money.
Gimme money.

70
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:46,857
You be careful,
sweetie,

71
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,559
and call us as soon
as the plane lands.

72
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,910
Okay, Mom, I will.

73
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:51,312
I'll miss you, Dad.

74
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,481
I've never been very good
at saying good-bee.

75
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:55,266
Good-bee, Meg.

76
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:56,600
And I'm gonna
bring you back

77
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:58,386
something special,
little guy.

78
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:00,688
Don't worry about me.
Just get yourself laid.

79
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,990
Will you get me
French Stewart's autograph?

80
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,625
Say hello
to the Pont Neuf for me,

81
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:06,861
or as I like to call it,
my inspiration point...

82
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:07,928
Oh, you're gone.

83
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:09,330
And the family's gone.

84
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:19,340
Oh, my God, we're
actually here in Paris.

85
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,859
This is so exciting!

86
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:23,327
Good day, foreigners.

87
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:26,297
On behalf of the country
of France, we surrender.

88
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:28,599
Oh, my God,
I love your breath.

89
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,700
Hi, I'm Meg.

90
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:32,119
This is my friend, Ruth.

91
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:34,098
Would you ladies
like to share a cab,

92
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,884
Or as we say,
"sharre a cabbuh"?

93
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:37,885
Sure.

94
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:39,153
That sounds great.

95
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:41,088
Oh, and please
do not be suspicious

96
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:42,590
that I am
at the airport

97
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,392
with no baggage
whatsoever.

98
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:49,463
A cool name to say
with a French accent

99
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:51,432
is Ashtahn Kootchere.

100
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,419
Bye!

101
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:56,470
Thanks!

102
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,125
Hey, it's me.

103
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:02,860
I've got
some fresh arrivals for you.

104
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:04,528
How are they?

105
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:06,097
On a scale from <i>un</i> to <i>dix,</i>

106
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:08,999
they're about a <i>trois.</i>

107
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:12,153
Wow, this place
is awesome!

108
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,521
I know!

109
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,623
Hey, you wanna dance around
like morons to loud music?

110
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:18,158
I'll be right back.

111
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,478
I've been holding in
a dump since America.

112
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,901
Griffin residence.

113
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:28,168
Hi, Dad, it's me.

114
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,137
Just wanted you to know
I got here safe.

115
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:30,905
And sound?

116
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:32,907
Yes, Dad, and sound.

117
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:34,041
Oh, good.

118
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,093
The "sound" is what concerns me.

119
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:37,995
Oh, it's so amazing here, Dad.
Yep.

120
00:04:38,063 --> 00:04:39,597
You should see it.
Uh-huh.

121
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,198
The apartment we're staying in is huge,
Uh-huh.

122
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:42,566
and has an incredible view of...
Uh-huh.

123
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:44,902
Dad, something's
going on.

124
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,103
Some men just broke in.

125
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:50,541
Oh, my God!
They've got Ruth!

126
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,361
And now, I think
they're coming after me!

127
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:55,596
All right, Meg,

128
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:57,698
I need you to listen to me
very carefully:

129
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:58,799
panic.

130
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,234
Pay no attention to detail.

131
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:02,002
Let your mind race.

132
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,804
Take short, rapid breaths.

133
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:05,473
Then hide under the bed,

134
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,374
but leave two of your feet
sticking out.

135
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:14,798
Oh, my God, Dad!

136
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,817
Are they gonna take me?
I'm so scared!

137
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:19,720
Meg? Meg?

138
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:27,394
I don't know who you are.
I don't know what you want.

139
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:30,397
But I have a very particular
lack of skills.

140
00:05:30,448 --> 00:05:32,783
I will never be able
to find you,

141
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:34,735
but what I do have
is two dollars

142
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:36,337
and a Casio wristwatch.

143
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,222
You can have one of them.

144
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,624
Drakkar Noir.

145
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,460
These guys are serious.

146
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:45,196
Lois, Meg's dead!

147
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,068
Please, there's gotta be
something you can do!

148
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:53,337
My little girl is
in terrible danger!

149
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:54,872
Ma'am, the men
who took your daughter

150
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,140
are most likely members

151
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,108
of a sophisticated network
of human smugglers.

152
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:00,077
If she's not found
within 96 hours,

153
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:02,279
chances are
she's gone forever.

154
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:03,714
Then we've gotta hurry!

155
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:05,249
Sorry, we can't
begin our search

156
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:07,451
until she's been missing
for 96 hours.

157
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,620
Oh, my God! My baby!

158
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:11,689
Yeah, there's a pretty grisly
sex trade over there.

159
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:14,525
Usually we just end up
burying framed pictures.

160
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:16,460
Oh, Peter!
This is a nightmare!

161
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:21,665
What's going on
down there?

162
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:22,700
Are they gonna
find her?

163
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:23,834
Doesn't look good.

164
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:25,769
Stewie, I think
there's only one way

165
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:27,404
we're ever gonna
see Meg again.

166
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:29,573
You and I have to take matters
into our own hands.

167
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:31,175
What? What are you
talking about?

168
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:32,793
Look, you're the only one
who's got the know-how

169
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:34,778
and the technology
to help us track her down.

170
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:36,296
Hmm. Interesting.

171
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:38,315
Last week, all my gadgets
were "hooey,"

172
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
I think was the word.

173
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:41,585
I didn't say...
You said "hooey"!

174
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:42,820
All right, I've booked us
on a flight

175
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:44,421
that leaves in two hours,

176
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:46,957
so, um, whose credit card
shall we put it on?

177
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,592
Just put it on yours
and I'll pay you back.

178
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,094
Yeah, I feel like
when that happens,

179
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,462
I sometimes don't
get paid back.

180
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:52,930
Like when?

181
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,266
<i>Jersey Boys,</i> Morton's
Steakhouse, Foxwoods...

182
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,368
Foxwoods and <i>Jersey Boys</i>
was the same trip!

183
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:58,869
You know what? Fine.

184
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:00,521
I'll-I'll put it
on my card,

185
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,156
but I-I-I'm just gonna say
it's a gift

186
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,058
because that's the only way
I can do this anymore.

187
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,996
All right, the first thing
we've got to do when we land

188
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,848
is check the apartment
where Meg was abducted

189
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:14,182
and see if we can find
some clues.

190
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,917
That sounds good.
That's what I was thinking.

191
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:18,086
Excuse me, do you mind
if we switch seats

192
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:20,088
so my family can sit
all together?

193
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:22,090
No, we don't...
we-we don't switch.

194
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,425
'Cause when we booked,

195
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:24,993
they didn't have
three together...

196
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:26,661
Ma'am, ma'am,
your poor planning

197
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:28,663
does not constitute
an emergency for me.

198
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:31,366
You'll see him in Paris.
Go sit down.

199
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:34,002
God, Meg's kidnappers could be
anywhere in France by now.

200
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,904
Well, we do have
one lead, Brian.

201
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,973
I have a recording
of the kidnapper's voice.

202
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,758
What? You do? How?

203
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,109
I recorded
the kidnapper's phone call

204
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:42,310
with the fat man.

205
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,678
You see, Brian,
I record

206
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:46,047
all phone calls coming in
or out of the house.

207
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:47,582
Y-Y-You do?

208
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,951
Yep. This one's
one of my faves.

209
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:53,154
Hello, Fundamental Industries.
How can I help you?

210
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,823
Yeah, um, is this...
is this Bang Brothers?

211
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,558
Yes.

212
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,994
Oh. Okay. I-I-I'd like
to cancel my subscription.

213
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,128
Uh, what's your name?

214
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:01,463
Brian Griffin.

215
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,864
And which site
did you belong to?

216
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:05,367
Uh... Captain Stabbin'.

217
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:07,002
And how are you spelling that?

218
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,304
Uh... uh, "Captain", full word,

219
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:12,407
then "Stabbin',"
S-T-A-B-B-I-N apostrophe.

220
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:16,044
Okay, I'm checking.

221
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:19,648
You know, in-instead
of a "G" at the end.

222
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,116
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not finding that site.

223
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:23,051
Uh, what was the subject matter?

224
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,720
Um... a guy
doing chicks on a boat

225
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:27,455
in a, uh, captain's hat.

226
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:29,524
Okay, I'm checking.

227
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,393
The, um...

228
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,128
the, passengers had, uh,
just signed up

229
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:34,729
for a tour of the harbor

230
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,798
and then
all that stuff happened.

231
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:38,266
Okay, you made
your point.

232
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,009
Well, this is where
Meg was staying.

233
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:50,211
Oh. I thought Paris would be
a bit more picturesque.

234
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,513
Instead it's just traffic

235
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,982
and some big guy
using a jackhammer.

236
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,217
But monsieur,
ziss is not a jackhammer.

237
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,219
It is a "Jacqueshammer."

238
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,556
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-

239
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,825
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho...

240
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:08,079
Oh, God, it's worse
than I imagined.

241
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,364
You know, maybe
it'd help

242
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,333
if we just tried
to track Meg's movements

243
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,651
from the moment
she arrived in France.

244
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,868
That's a good idea, Brian.

245
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,287
Let's try Google Earth.

246
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,288
Worth a shot.

247
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,158
There. Enhance.

248
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:28,783
Wow, I never knew you could
do this on a computer.

249
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,819
'Course not, you spend
all your time on this

250
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,387
watching Captain Stabbin'.

251
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,356
All right, we've got
to find this man.

252
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:36,624
Let's see, this was
taken at the airport.

253
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:38,059
He could be
some sort of lookout

254
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:39,861
who spots girls
fresh off the plane.

255
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:42,030
Yes, you're probably right,
Brian. Such scum.

256
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:43,732
I'll bet they target
young girls

257
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,101
the way Army commercials
target minorities.

258
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,319
Hey.

259
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,853
Other black guys.

260
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,372
It ain't so bad.

261
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,898
Oh, my God, Stewie!
There he is!

262
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:01,616
Hey, buddy, we've got
a few questions for you!

263
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,487
Excuse me, but this is
a "smoking only" area.

264
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:07,122
Oh, sorry.
Do you have a, uh...

265
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,111
You know, I really only smoke
when I drink.

266
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,530
Oh. Well, this is nice.

267
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:17,665
This is a nice way
to do this.

268
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:20,235
Look, we need to know:
have you seen this girl?

269
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:23,438
Quick!
He's getting away!

270
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,393
Oh, no, he's one of those
parkour, free-running guys.

271
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,111
We'll never catch him!

272
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,238
Oh, no. I have
chateau'ed myself.

273
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,609
Damn it. He died before he could
tell us anything.

274
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,643
Brian, he's
the first guy.

275
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,312
The first guy
always dies.

276
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,863
Well, I'm sure
he didn't work alone.

277
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,482
Maybe there's something
in here we can use.

278
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,700
Ugh, this guy has
a Velcro wallet.

279
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:53,735
Grow up.

280
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,891
All right, this is the address
that was in his wallet.

281
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,276
Yeah, but how are we
gonna know for sure

282
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:02,660
if these are the guys
who took Meg?

283
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:05,313
Well, we have the kidnapper's
voice on tape, remember?

284
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,031
Drakkar Noir.

285
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,067
I can use the voice
recognition software

286
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,835
in this recorder
to confirm a match.

287
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:11,820
Now, here.

288
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:13,154
Take this briefcase.

289
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:15,974
We're Eastern European
cologne salesmen.

290
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,342
We ask them
what they want,

291
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,977
and when they say
"Drakkar Noir"--

292
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,078
which they all will--

293
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,780
we'll know
if we have our man.

294
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,299
Drakkar Noir?

295
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:27,702
All right, well,
that's not him,

296
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,237
but this is
gonna be easy.

297
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:33,808
Well, gentlemen,
now that you have smelled

298
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:36,044
all of our colognes,
what'll it be?

299
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,679
I will take
some Drakkar Noir.

300
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:40,582
How 'bout you?

301
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:41,950
I am disgusting,

302
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:44,018
so I will take
two bottle Drakkar Noir.

303
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,521
How 'bout you, chief?

304
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:47,822
Hmm.

305
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,991
Let me quickly grow beard
and think about it.

306
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:54,028
I will take
Drakkar Noir.

307
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,413
What the hell
are you doing?!

308
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,615
We haven't eaten
since the plane.

309
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,666
I'm starving.

310
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,827
Where is this girl?

311
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:27,162
Where is she?!

312
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,696
We keep girls upstairs.

313
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:30,398
I hope you burn in hell
along with the guy

314
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:33,301
who came up with
stuffing a turkey.

315
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:34,903
Hey!

316
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,672
Who wants to try
some of my "Butthole Bread"?

317
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,758
Meg?

318
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,676
Meg?

319
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,563
Help... me.

320
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,233
Oh, we're here to help
somebody else, sweetheart.

321
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,467
Go, go, go, go. Don't...
Don't look at her.

322
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,818
Don't look at her.
That was my mistake.

323
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,107
Stewie, I don't see
Meg anywhere.

324
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,308
Brian, look!

325
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,197
Oh, my God!

326
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:03,214
Meg!

327
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,215
What the hell?

328
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,350
Where'd you get that hat?

329
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,018
Uh, a girl
gave it to me.

330
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,236
Well, what did she
look like?

331
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,305
She had a great
personality.

332
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,539
That's her.

333
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:12,974
Where is she?
Is she here?

334
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,510
No, uh, they took her
just a little while ago.

335
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:17,145
Every Wednesday night,

336
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,580
they auction
some of the girls off.

337
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:19,681
Wednesday?

338
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:20,748
What a weird night

339
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:22,483
to auction girls off
into slavery.

340
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,018
Well, you know,
on the weekend,

341
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:24,986
people probably
have plans.

342
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,221
Have plans?

343
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:27,455
What are you doing
that's more important

344
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:28,790
than buying somebody?

345
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:29,908
Look, where is
this place?

346
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,942
Where do they have
the auction?

347
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,043
I don't know,

348
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,878
but there is
a courtesy shuttle

349
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,313
that runs
every 20 minutes.

350
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,481
What?

351
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,084
Aw, damn it.
We just missed it.

352
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,519
What do you wanna do
for 20 minutes?

353
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,520
Well, I don't know
'bout you,

354
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,655
but I'm gonna work out.

355
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,989
That's how you stay in shape.

356
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,574
You just fit it in
when you have free time,

357
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:47,842
wherever you are,
wherever you can.

358
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,594
There's semen on this floor.

359
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:54,832
Stewie, look!

360
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,602
We gotta get in there!

361
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,154
Hey, got one more here!

362
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:01,456
Oh, where are we?

363
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:02,874
I'm from Atlanta.

364
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,709
I don't know
where we are!

365
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,844
Hey, you better hurry.
They're starting soon.

366
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,113
You know what's messed up?

367
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,415
This is all for charity.

368
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,516
All the proceeds
are going to Oxfam.

369
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,578
I hope we're not too late.

370
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:24,996
You should not
be out here.

371
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,464
Bidding is about to start.
What the hell?

372
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,366
Stewie!

373
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:36,891
The current bid is $200,000.

374
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,026
Oh, my God.

375
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:40,662
Going once, twice...

376
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:42,797
Sold for $200,000.

377
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,832
Remember:

378
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,551
There is cash back
when you use your Visa Gold.

379
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:50,188
Our next item appears to be
a late entry.

380
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:51,723
It is not in the catalog.

381
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,691
What the hell?

382
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,426
All right, fellas,
bring the lights up a bit,

383
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,029
play the CD I gave you
and let's do this!

384
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,166
♪ California girls,
we're unforgettable ♪

385
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,619
Ah, that's right.
You like that?

386
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,071
I have $50,000.
♪ Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top ♪

387
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,090
I have $75,000.
♪ Sun-kissed skin so hot ♪

388
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,758
Thank you, Brett Ratner.
♪ We'll melt your popsicle... ♪

389
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,410
Do I have $100,000?

390
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:14,745
Oh, for God's sake.
$500,000.

391
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:17,215
We have $500,000.

392
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,217
Going once, going twice,

393
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:20,852
sold...

394
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,638
to the man
who doesn't quite get auctions.

395
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,440
That was so fun.

396
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,924
How do you
be paying?

397
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,593
Oh, I, uh, I don't
have any money.

398
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,961
Can we work it out,

399
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,263
uh, maybe, some...
other way?

400
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:33,681
Wait a minute.

401
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,783
Something doesn't
smell funny here.

402
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,051
You're not Arab!

403
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:39,137
You two are coming
with me.

404
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,805
This next girl is perfect

405
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,874
for those of you
who want to buy a sex slave

406
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:45,543
but don't want to spend
sex-slave money.

407
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,744
Oh, my God, Meg!

408
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,846
Wonder what music
they're gonna use for her?

409
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,754
Huh, seems about right.

410
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:05,303
Damn it. We were so close
to saving Meg.

411
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:06,921
Hey, where's my sister?

412
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:10,458
She's probably having
her shish kabobbed as we speak.

413
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:13,061
I heard that from Samantha
in <i>Sex and the City 2.</i>

414
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,929
Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba,
I haven't seen it yet.

415
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:16,464
That doesn't hurt
the story.

416
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:18,116
And now prepare to...

417
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:21,186
We have a jail cell.

418
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:22,470
I always tell them,

419
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:24,472
"Put the prisoners
in the jail cell,"

420
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,075
but they always say,
"Just chain 'em up to a pipe."

421
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:28,326
Idiots.

422
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:31,229
Hey, that was some
good teamwork, Brian.

423
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:32,730
We were like Lewis and Clark

424
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:34,983
and the guy who likes
to tip over canoes.

425
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,951
Ugh, these rapids
are treacherous.

426
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:38,903
We should reach calmer waters
by nightfall.

427
00:16:38,971 --> 00:16:40,488
Uh-oh!
Earthquake!

428
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,506
Hey, come on!

429
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,791
Careful!

430
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,327
Damn it. Why is he
still with us?

431
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:47,595
I know!

432
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:49,097
Until now, walking
to the other end

433
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:51,266
of the United States seemed
like such a good job.

434
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,969
There she is! Hurry!

435
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:58,723
Stewie, what are you doing?

436
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,758
We'll never catch
a speeding car on foot.

437
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:02,360
Haven't you ever seen
an action movie?

438
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:03,862
All we have to do

439
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,581
is cut diagonally
across any nearby field.

440
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:12,704
See?

441
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:23,598
Aw, crap, they're taking her
onto that yacht.

442
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:31,005
All right, we just gotta
catch up to the boat.

443
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:32,223
Well, how we
gonna do that?

444
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,126
Oh, cool!
They got Car Chase GPS.

445
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:38,980
Back up dangerously into traffic.

446
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:48,139
Proceed wrong way
down busy street for 500 meters.

447
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:56,664
Say "hang on"
and drive down staircase.

448
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:58,283
Hang on!

449
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:10,378
Poorly edited shot where driver
is obviously stuntperson.

450
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:24,008
Leave fart in closed car
like a dick.

451
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:25,743
Sorry about that!

452
00:18:28,314 --> 00:18:30,315
All right, they're probably
holding her below deck.

453
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:32,233
You take the right side.
I'll take the left.

454
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:33,618
You're gonna need this.

455
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:35,436
What? I-I-I've never
killed anybody before.

456
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:36,654
Relax, they're Arabs.

457
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:39,157
People will still be rooting
for you.

458
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:40,158
Hey!

459
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,795
Son of a bitch.

460
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:48,149
Oh. This is like
a video game.

461
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:52,720
Ah, I'm kinda good at this.

462
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,141
Later, dink.

463
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:22,400
That's for shooting
one of our guys!

464
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:24,869
We got you!
In your face!

465
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:26,087
Our boat!
Our boat!

466
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:27,455
This boat!

467
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:31,993
Let me go,
you fat bastard!

468
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:33,962
I will never be
your sex slave!

469
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:35,546
You misunderstand.

470
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,799
I did not buy you
to be my slave.

471
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:40,668
I bought you for my son,
and not to be his slave,

472
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:42,904
but to be his wife.

473
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:43,905
Wife?

474
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:44,906
Faisal!

475
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:48,943
This is Faisal,

476
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:50,979
my son and the heir
to my throne.

477
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:53,815
My father was correct.

478
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:56,184
Your beauty
knows no bounds.

479
00:19:56,251 --> 00:19:58,286
Fair goddess,
it is my hope

480
00:19:58,354 --> 00:19:59,821
that you will agree
to be my wife,

481
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:01,656
but the choice is yours.

482
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:02,991
If you say "no,"

483
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:04,559
I will have you flown back
to your family

484
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,027
on our private jet.

485
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:07,528
But if you say "yes,"

486
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,497
I will spend
the rest of my days

487
00:20:09,548 --> 00:20:11,916
making your every wish
come true.

488
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:15,253
Will you be my wife,
Princess Meg?

489
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,288
Oh, yes! Yes!

490
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:23,728
Nooooo!

491
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:25,196
Stewie?

492
00:20:25,264 --> 00:20:28,049
Hi, Meg.

493

494
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:35,188
Oh honey, we are so glad
to have you back

495
00:20:35,363 --> 00:20:37,184
but you really don't
remember anything?

496
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,639
Not really, Mom.

497
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:40,574
I mean, one minute,
I was being proposed to

498
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:42,310
by a handsome
Arabian prince,

499
00:20:42,377 --> 00:20:43,511
and the next thing
I know,

500
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:45,413
I'm waking up
in a French hospital.

501
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,148
Oh, and we heard
from Ruth's parents.

502
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:48,883
She had her tongue ripped out.

503
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:52,053
I guess we got off easy, huh?

504
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,254
Well, we put
all your mail

505
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:54,755
on the desk in your room,
sweetheart.

506
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:55,957
Thanks, Dad.

507
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:57,391
I'm kidding.
You didn't get any mail.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
