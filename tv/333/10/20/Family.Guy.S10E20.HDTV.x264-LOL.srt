1
00:00:00,675 --> 00:00:04,043
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:07,417
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:10,887
But where are those good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:13,957
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,750
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,953
Lucky there's a man who positively can do

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,555
All the things that make us

8
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:23,973
Laugh and cry

9
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,653
He's... a... Fam... ily... Guy!

10
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:30,178
<font color=#00FF00> Family Guy 10x20 </font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Leggo My Meg-O</font>
放开我的梅格

11
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:30,178
片名恶搞了Eggo华夫饼的广告语L'eggo my Eggo
另本集内容大量来自于《飓风营救》

12
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,679


13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,917

All right, ladies,

我选除了Meg的所有人
I pick everyone except Meg.

00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,541
选得好 开始
Fair enough. Go!

19
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,125
嘿 你们要去哪儿
Hey, where's everybody going?

20
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,127
我们可不是这样下课的噢
That's not how we end this class.

知道么 我想我不能
You know, I don't think I can take

再忍受一个学期了 Ruth
another semester at this school, Ruth.

29
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:17,019
太痛苦了
It's torture.

30
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:19,788
比在飞机上坐婴儿旁边还要痛苦
It's worse than sitting next to a baby on an airplane.

31
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,658
什么风把你吹到肯塔基州来的
So what brings you to Kentucky?

32
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:23,892
我是来看望家人的

00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:34,636


38
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:35,854
嘿 我想到了
Hey, I know!

39
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:36,955
如果你这么讨厌在这的话
If you hate it so much here,

40
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:38,056
你为什么不去巴黎
why don't you come to Paris

41
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:39,441
我和一起待一个学期呢

而且我姑姑在那里还有间公寓
My aunt even has an apartment there

46
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,666
我们可以免费住在那
that we can stay in for free.

47
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:50,135
天啊 听上去太棒了

48
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:51,653
打扰了 我想问你

好吧 那么没人愿意了
Well, that's everybody.

52
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:05,550
现在我们继续播放《埃塞俄比亚囤积者》
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to <i>Ethiopian Hoarders.</i>

53
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:08,754
我不知道事情是怎么发展成这样的
I don't know how it got like this!

54
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,322
爸 妈
Dad, Mom,

55
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,757
我有些事要问你们一下

56
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:13,992
我能去巴黎留学一个学期么
Can I go to school in Paris for a semester?

57

嘿 我在巴黎有个笔友
Hey, you know, I have a pen pal in Paris.

你能帮我把这封信交给他么
Would you mind bringing him this letter?

60

我们正在吵架呢
We're fighting.

61
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,503
Meg 我们很愿意送你去巴黎学习一学期
Meg, I'd love to send you to Paris for a semester,

62
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,921
但我们负担不起啊
but we can't afford that.

63
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,189
但我可以自己出钱
But I can pay for it myself.

64
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:28,957
我所有的兼职工钱都存下来了

66
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:31,560
有时有我也
You know, sometimes I do

67
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:33,729
做点兼职赚个闲钱

68
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:36,748
给我钱 给我钱

00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:46,858
小心一点儿 宝贝
You be careful, sweetie,

71
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,560
飞机一降落你就给我们打电话

我会想你的 爸

74
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,482
我一直不擅长说再进(再见)
I've never been very good at saying good-bee.

75
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,267
再进了 Meg
Good-bee, Meg.

76
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:56,601
我回来会给你带
And I'm gonna bring you back

特别的礼物哟 小伙计
something special, little guy.

78
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:00,689
别管我了 你自己能找到个人上床就行了
Don't worry about me. Just get yourself laid.

79
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:02,991
你能帮我弄到French Stewart的签名么
Will you get me French Stewart's autograph?

80
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:02,991
美演员 出演过《歪星撞地球》中的Harry
他只是名字是French(法国人)而已

81
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,626
代我向巴黎的新桥问好
Say hello to the Pont Neuf for me,

82
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:06,862
或者用我喜欢名字来叫它 我的灵感之地…
or as I like to call it, my inspiration point...

83
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:07,929

118
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,042
噢 好的
(relieved):Oh, good.

119
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,094
"无恙"才是我关心的
The "sound" is what concerns me.

120
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:37,996
噢 这里太棒了 爸 - 嗯
- Oh, it's so amazing here, Dad. - Yep.

- 我们住的公寓特别大 - 嗯哼

- and has an incredible view of... - Uh-huh.

124
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:42,567
Peter在S06E04也对Meg做过同样的事

125
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:44,903
爸 出了点事
Dad, something's going on.

126

有人闯进来了
Some men just broke in.

127

天啊 他们抓了Ruth

130
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:57,699
我需要你仔细听好:
I need you to listen to me very carefully:

131
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:58,800
惊慌
panic.

132
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:58,800
这和《飓风营救》里的台词正好相反

133
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:00,235
不要关注任何细节
Pay no attention to detail.

134
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:02,003
放开你思维的束缚
Let your mind race.

135
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:03,805
短暂 急促的呼吸
Take short, rapid breaths.

136
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:05,474
然后藏到床下
Then hide under the bed,

137
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,375
但把你的双脚伸到外面
but leave two of your feet sticking out.

138
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:14,799
天啊 爸
Oh, my God, Dad!

139
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:16,818
他们会抓走我吗 我好害怕
Are they gonna take me? I'm so scared!

140
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:19,721
Meg? Meg?

141
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,395
我不知道你是谁 我也不知道你的目的是什么
I don't know who you are.I don't know what you want.

142
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:30,398
但我什么能力也没有
But I have a very particular lack of skills.

143
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:32,784
我永远不会找到你
I will never be able to find you,

144
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,736
但我有的是 2美元
but what I do have is two dollars

145
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:36,338
还有一只卡西欧腕表
and a Casio wristwatch.

146
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:38,223
你可以得到其中之一
You can have one of them.

147
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,625
黑色达卡
Drakkar Noir.

148
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:40,625
一款男士香水

149
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:43,461
这些家伙是来真的
These guys are serious.

150
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,197
Lois Meg死翘翘了
Lois, Meg's dead!

151
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,069
求你们了 你们肯定能做点什么
Please, there's gotta be something you can do!

152
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:53,338
我女儿现在处境非常危险啊
My little girl is in terrible danger!

153
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:54,873
女士 带走你女儿的人
Ma'am, the men who took your daughter

154
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:56,141
很有可能是
are most likely members

155
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:58,109
来自一个经营多年的人贩子团伙
of a sophisticated network of human smugglers.

156
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:00,078
如果没有在96小时内找到她
If she's not found within 96 hours,

157
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:02,280
那她就永远也找不到了
chances are she's gone forever.

158
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:03,715
那我们得抓紧了
Then we've gotta hurry!

159
00:06:03,783 --> 00:06:05,250
抱歉 我们不能开始搜索
Sorry, we can't begin our search

160
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:07,452
直到她失踪96小时了才行
until she's been missing for 96 hours.

161
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,621
天啊 我的儿啊
Oh, my God! My baby!

162
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,690
是的 那里可是有非常恐怖的性交易呢
Yeah, there's a pretty grisly sex trade over there.

163
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:14,526
一般情况 我们最后只能埋葬他们的肖像了
Usually we just end up burying framed pictures.

164
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:16,461
噢 Peter 这就是场噩梦啊
Oh, Peter! This is a nightmare!

165
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,666
下面情况怎样
What's going on down there?

166
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:22,701
他们会找到她么
Are they gonna find her?

167
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:23,835
情况不是很妙
Doesn't look good.

168
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:25,770
Stewie 我想我们只有一个方法
Stewie, I think there's only one way

169
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:27,405
才能再见到Meg了
we're ever gonna see Meg again.

170
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:29,574
我们俩必须亲自处理这事儿了
You and I have to take matters into our own hands.

171
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:31,176
什么 你什么意思
What? What are you talking about?

172
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:32,794
听着 你是唯一一个掌握
Look, you're the only one who's got the know-how

173
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:34,779
能找到她能力和技术的
and the technology to help us track her down.

174
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:36,297
哼 这就怪了
Hmm. Interesting.

175
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,316
上周 我的小玩意儿还叫"废物"来着
Last week, all my gadgets were "hooey,"

176
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:39,601
我想你就是这么说的
I think was the word.

177
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:41,586
- 我没有说… - 你说了"废物"
- I didn't say... - You said "hooey"!

178
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:42,821
好了 我已经给咱俩订好了飞机
All right, I've booked us on a flight

179
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:44,422
还有2小时起飞
that leaves in two hours,

180
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,958
那么 呃 我应该刷谁的信用卡
so, um, whose credit card shall we put it on?

181
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:48,593
就刷你的吧 我会还你的
Just put it on yours and I'll pay you back.

182
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:50,095
呃 我怎么感觉一般这种情况
Yeah, I feel like when that happens,

183
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:51,463
我的钱都要不回来了
I sometimes don't get paid back.

184
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:51,463
Brian借钱从来不还 见S04E20

185
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,931
比如什么时候
Like when?

186
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:55,267
《泽西男孩》音乐剧 莫顿牛排馆 快活林赌场
<i>Jersey Boys,</i> Morton's Steakhouse, Foxwoods...

187
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:55,267
快活林赌场在康涅狄格州 是世界上最大的赌场之一

188
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,369
快活林赌场和《泽西男孩》那是同一次旅行里的
Foxwoods and <i>Jersey Boys</i> was the same trip!

189
00:06:57,436 --> 00:06:58,870
既然这样 那好吧
You know what? Fine.

190
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:00,522
我-我还是刷我的卡
I'll-I'll put it on my card,

191
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,157
但 我-我要强调这是个礼物
but I-I-I'm just gonna say it's a gift

192
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:04,059
因为只有这样我才会继续替你付钱
because that's the only way I can do this anymore.

193
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,997
好了 我们着陆后的首要任务
All right, the first thing we've got to do when we land

194
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,849
是去看看Meg被绑架的公寓
is check the apartment where Meg was abducted

195
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,183
看能不能发现点线索
and see if we can find some clues.

196
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,918
听起来不错 我刚就这么想来着
That sounds good. That's what I was thinking.

197
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:18,087
打扰一下 我们能否换下座位
Excuse me, do you mind if we switch seats

198
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,089
这样我们一家人就能坐到一起了
so my family can sit all together?

199
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:22,091
不 我们…我们不换
No, we don't... we-we don't switch.

200
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,426
因为我们订票的时候
'Cause when we booked,

201
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,994
他们没有3个连在一起…
they didn't have three together...

202
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:26,662
女士 女士 你的规划不善
Ma'am, ma'am, your poor planning

203
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,664
对我来说又不是什么紧急事件
does not constitute an emergency for me.

204
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:31,367
你们会在巴黎再见的 去坐下吧
You'll see him in Paris. Go sit down.

205
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:34,003
天 绑架Meg的人现在可能在法国的任何一个角落
God, Meg's kidnappers could be anywhere in France by now.

206
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,905
但我们有一条线索 Brian
Well, we do have one lead, Brian.

207
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:37,974
我录到了那个绑架者的声音
I have a recording of the kidnapper's voice.

208
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,759
什么 你有? 怎么来的
What? You do? How?

209
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,110
我录下了那个绑架者
I recorded the kidnapper's phone call

210
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:42,311
和胖子的通话
with the fat man.

211
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,679
其实 Brian 我录下了
You see, Brian, I record

212
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:46,048
所有打进或打出我们家的电话
all phone calls coming in or out of the house.

213
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,583
你-你-你录了?
Y-Y-You do?

214
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:49,952
是啊 其中有我最爱的一通
Yep. This one's one of my faves.

215
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,155
你好 这里是基本业务部 你有什么需要
WOMAN: Hello, Fundamental Industries. How can I help you?

216
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,824
嗯 呃 这…这里是"啪啪啪"兄弟公司么
BRIAN: Yeah, um, is this... is this Bang Brothers?

217
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,559
是的
WOMAN:Yes.

218
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:58,995
噢 好 我-我想取消我的订阅
BRIAN: Oh. Okay. I-I-I'd like to cancel my subscription.

219
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,129
呃 你的名字是?
WOMAN:Uh, what's your name?

220
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:01,464
BRIAN:Brian Griffin.

221
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:02,865
那你是订的哪个网站的片子
WOMAN: And which site did you belong to?

222
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:05,368
呃 "插入船长"
BRIAN:Uh... Captain Stabbin'.

223
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:05,368
据说确实有这个网站

224
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:07,003
怎么写的
WOMAN:And how are you spelling that?

225
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,305
呃 "船长"两个字
BRIAN:Uh... uh, "Captain", full word,

226
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:12,408
然后"插撸" 提手旁 一个千 一个臼 然后一个提手一个鲁
then "Stabbin',"S-T-A-B-B-I-N apostrophe.

227
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:16,045
好的 我查一下
WOMAN:Okay, I'm checking.

228
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:19,649
那个 还是换成"插入"吧
BRIAN: You know, in-instead of a "G" at the end.

229
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,117
抱歉 先生 我没有找到你说的片子的网站
WOMAN: I'm sorry, sir.I'm not finding that site.

230
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:23,052
请问一下题材是什么
Uh, what was the subject matter?

231
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,721
呃 一个人在船上干小妞
BRIAN: Um... a guy doing chicks on a boat

232
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:27,456
戴着 呃 船长的帽子
in a, uh, captain's hat.

233
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:29,525
好 我查一下
WOMAN: Okay, I'm checking.

234
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,394
那个 呃
BRIAN: The, um...

235
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,129
那个 乘客刚 呃 刚刚登记好
the, passengers had, uh, just signed up

236
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:34,730
要在海湾来一次旅行
for a tour of the harbor

237
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,799
然后剩下的事就发生了
and then all that stuff happened.

238
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:38,267
好吧 你已经表达得很明白了
Okay, you made your point.

239
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,010
好了 这就是Meg待的地方
Well, this is where Meg was staying.

240
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:50,212
噢 我以为巴黎会更诗情画意一点
Oh. I thought Paris would be a bit more picturesque.

241
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,514
而不是交通拥堵
Instead it's just traffic

242
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:53,983
还有个壮汉在使用千斤顶
and some big guy using a jackhammer.

243
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,218
但是先森 介可不系千斤顶哦
But monsieur, ziss is not a jackhammer.

244
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,220
这是"青筋顶"
It is a "Jacqueshammer."

245
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,220
jacques相当于英语中的jack

246
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:08,080
天 比我想象的还糟
Oh, God, it's worse than I imagined.

247
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,365
对了 也许
You know, maybe it'd help

248
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,334
你查一下Meg到巴黎以后的
if we just tried to track Meg's movements

249
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,652
动向也许会有帮助
from the moment she arrived in France.

250
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,869
好主意 Brian
That's a good idea, Brian.

251
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:15,288
我们来试试谷歌地球
Let's try Google Earth.

252
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,289
值得一试
Worth a shot.

253
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,159
那里 放大
There. Enhance.

254
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,784
哇 我从来不知道电脑还能这么用
Wow, I never knew you could do this on a computer.

255
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:30,820
当然不了 你把所有在电脑上的时间
'Course not, you spend all your time on this

256
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:32,388
都用来看插入船长了
watching Captain Stabbin'.

257
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:34,357
好吧 我们得找到这个人
All right, we've got to find this man.

258
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:36,625
让我看看 这是在机场照的
Let's see, this was taken at the airport.

259
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:38,060
他可能是个打前站的
He could be some sort of lookout

260
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,862
专挑那些刚下飞机的妹子
who spots girls fresh off the plane.

261
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,031
嗯 你应该是对的 Brian 真是个败类
Yes, you're probably right, Brian. Such scum.

262
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:43,733
我敢打赌他们瞄准了年轻女孩
I'll bet they target young girls

263
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,102
就跟陆军广告瞄准了那些少数族裔一样
the way Army commercials target minorities.

264
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,854
嘿 其他的黑哥们
Hey. Other black guys.

265
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,373
没那么糟 对吧
It ain't so bad.

266
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,899
天啊 Stewie 他在那
Oh, my God, Stewie! There he is!

267
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,617
嘿 兄弟 我们有些问题想问问你
Hey, buddy, we've got a few questions for you!

268
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:05,488
不好意思 但这里是"吸烟者专区"
Excuse me, but this is a "smoking only" area.

269
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:07,123
噢 抱歉 那你有 呃…
Oh, sorry. Do you have a, uh...

270
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:13,112
知道么 我仅当喝酒的时候才会抽烟
You know, I really only smoke when I drink.

271
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:15,531
噢 这真好
Oh. Well, this is nice.

272
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,666
这样方式干这个还真不错
This is a nice way to do this.

273
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:20,236
听着 我们想知道: 你见过这女孩么
Look, we need to know:have you seen this girl?

274
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:23,439
快 他要逃掉了
Quick! He's getting away!

275
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,394
噢 不 他是那种会跑酷的家伙
Oh, no, he's one of those parkour, free-running guys.

We ask them what they want,

297
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,978
当他们说要"黑色达卡"时--

298
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,079
而且他们都会说--

00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:53,485
(游戏节目"Let's Make A Deal"中的经典音乐)

418
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,755
嗯 挺合适的
Huh, seems about right.

419
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:05,304
妈的 我们本来离救到Meg就差一步了
Damn it. We were so close to saving Meg.

420
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:06,922
嘿 我的姐姐在哪
Hey, where's my sister?

421
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:10,459
她大概正在享用"烤肉串"了 用我们的话来说
She's probably having her shish kababbed as we speak.

422
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:10,459
指男人的那话儿

423
00:16:10,527 --> 00:16:13,062
我是从《欲望都市2》中Samantha那听来的
I heard that from Samantha in <i>Sex and the City 2.</i>

424
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,930
阿-我不要听-我不要听 我还没看呢
Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba, I haven't seen it yet.

425
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:16,465
这和剧情无关的
That doesn't hurt the story.

426
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,117
那么现在准备受…
And now prepare to...

427
00:16:19,402 --> 00:16:21,187
我们有间牢房的
We have a jail cell.

428
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:22,471
我老是跟他们说
I always tell them,

429
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:24,473
"把囚犯关进牢房"
"Put the prisoners in the jail cell,"

430
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,076
但他们总说"还是直接用链子把它们锁在管子上吧"
but they always say,"Just chain 'em up to a pipe."

431
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:28,327
全是二货
Idiots.

432
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,230
嘿 刚才合作不错哟 Brian
Hey, that was some good teamwork, Brian.

433
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:32,731
但我们以前就像Lewis和Clark
We were like Lewis and Clark

434
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:32,731
在S08E07中也出现过这两人的段子
这两人为美国历史上著名探险家

435
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,984
还有那个喜欢弄翻独木舟的小子
and the guy who likes to tip over canoes.

436
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:36,952
啊 这些湍流很危险
Ugh, these rapids are treacherous.

437
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:38,904
我们得在夜幕降临前划到平静的水域
We should reach calmer waters by nightfall.

438
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:40,489
啊噢 地震啦
Uh-oh!Earthquake!

439
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,507
嘿 快停下
Hey, come on!

440
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:42,792
小心点
Careful!

441
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:46,328
妈的 他怎么还和我们在一起
Damn it. Why is he still with us?

442
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:47,596
可不是嘛
I know!

443
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:49,098
直到现在 徒步穿越
Until now, walking to the other end

444
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:51,267
美国还是个很吃香的工作呢
of the United States seemed like such a good job.

445
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,970
她在那 快
There she is! Hurry!

446
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:58,724
Stewie 你要干嘛
Stewie, what are you doing?

447
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,759
我们用脚的话是绝对追不上飞车的
We'll never catch a speeding car on foot.

448
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,361
你从来没看过动作片么
Haven't you ever seen an action movie?

449
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:03,863
我们只需
All we have to do

450
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,582
对角穿过邻近的场地就可以了
is cut diagonally across any nearby field.

451
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:12,705
看到没
See?

452
00:17:21,314 --> 00:17:23,599
啊 日了 他们把她带上游艇了
Aw, crap, they're taking her onto that yacht.

453
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:31,006
好吧 我们只要追上游艇就可以了
All right, we just gotta catch up to the boat.

454
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:32,224
那我们要怎么才能办到呢
Well, how we gonna do that?

455
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:35,127
噢 酷啊 这车有追车GPS系统
Oh, cool! They got Car Chase GPS.

456
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:38,981
惊险的回到车流当中
FEMALE GPS VOICE:Back up dangerously into traffic.

457
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,140
继续在繁忙的反向车道上往前开500米
Proceed wrong way down busy street for 500 meters.

458
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,665
说"抓紧" 然后开下阶梯
Say "hang on" and drive down staircase.

459
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,284
抓紧
Hang on!

460
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:10,379
出现明显的有特技人员的穿帮镜头
Poorly edited shot where driver is obviously stuntperson.

461
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,009
像个混蛋一样在封闭的车内留了个屁
Leave fart in closed car like a dick.

462
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:25,744
不好意思啦
BRIAN:Sorry about that!

463
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,316
好了 他们应该是把她抓到下层甲板了
All right, they're probably holding her below deck.

464
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,234
你去右边 我去左边
You take the right side. I'll take the left.

465
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,619
你会需要这个的
You're gonna need this.

466
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:35,437
什么 我-我从来没杀过人呢
What? I-I-I've never killed anybody before.

467
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:35,437
在912中杀过Stewie

468
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:36,655
放轻松 他们是阿拉伯人
Relax, they're Arabs.

469
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,158
人们依然会为你欢呼的
People will still be rooting for you.

470
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:40,159
嘿
Hey!

471
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,796
妈了个巴子的
Son of a bitch.

472
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:48,150
噢 这就和电子游戏一样
Oh. This is like a video game.

473
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:52,721
啊 看来我很擅长这个嘛
Ah, I'm kinda good at this.

474
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:57,142
别了 笨蛋
Later, dink.

475
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,401
这一枪是还给你们的
That's for shooting one of our guys!

476
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,870
整到你了吧 射你一脸
We got you! In your face!

477
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:26,088
我们的船赢了 我们的船
Our boat! Our boat!

478
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:27,456
这艘船
This boat!

479
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,994
放开我 你这死肥子
Let me go, you fat bastard!

480
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:33,963
我绝不会给你当性奴的
I will never be your sex slave!

481
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,547
你理解错了
You misunderstand.

482
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,800
我不是买你来当奴隶的
I did not buy you to be my slave.

483
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:40,669
我是为我儿买的 但也不是做他的奴隶
I bought you for my son, and not to be his slave,

484
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:42,905
而是他的妻子
but to be his wife.

485
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,906
妻子?
Wife?

486
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:44,907
Faisal!

487
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,944
这是Faisal
This is Faisal,

488
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:50,980
我的儿子 也是我王位的继承人
my son and the heir to my throne.

489
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:53,816
我父亲说的没错
My father was correct.

490
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:56,185
你的美貌难以言表
Your beauty knows no bounds.

491
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:58,287
美丽的女神 我希望
Fair goddess, it is my hope

492
00:19:58,355 --> 00:19:59,822
你会同意做我的妻子
that you will agree to be my wife,

493
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:01,657
但选择权在你手上
but the choice is yours.

494
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:02,992
如果你说"不"
If you say "no,"

495
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,560
我会护送你飞回家人身边
I will have you flown back to your family

496
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:06,028
用我的私人专机
on our private jet.

497
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:07,529
如果你说"是"
But if you say "yes,"

498
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,498
我就会用我的余生
I will spend the rest of my days

499
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:11,917
来实现你的每个愿望
making your every wish come true.

500
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,254
你愿意做我的妻子么 Meg公主
Will you be my wife, Princess Meg?

501
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:17,289
噢 我愿意 愿意

00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:25,197

504
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,050
嗨 Meg
Hi, Meg.

505
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:28,050
《黑衣人》中的记忆消除器

506
00:20:32,513 --> 00:20:35,189
噢 甜心 真高兴你回来了
Oh honey, we are so glad to have you back

507
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,185
但你真的一点也不记得了么
but you really don't remember anything?

508
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,640
不完全是 妈
Not really, Mom.

509
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,575
我是说 一分钟前 我还被一个
I mean, one minute, I was being proposed to

510
00:20:40,643 --> 00:20:42,311
帅气的阿拉伯王子求婚
by a handsome Arabian prince,

511
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:43,512
然后我只知道
and the next thing I know,

512
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,414
我在一家法国医院醒来了
I'm waking up in a French hospital.

513
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,149
噢 我们从Ruth的家长那听说了
Oh, and we heard from Ruth's parents.

514
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:48,884
她的舌头被拔了
She had her tongue ripped out.

515
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:52,054
还好我们没怎么受折磨 不是么
I guess we got off easy, huh?

516
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:53,255
对了 我们把你的所有邮件
Well, we put all your mail

都放到你房间的桌上了 甜心
on the desk in your room, sweetheart.

518
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:55,958
谢了 爸
Thanks, Dad.

519
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,392
我骗你的啦 你一封信也没有
I'm kidding. You didn't get any mail.

520
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:57,392
