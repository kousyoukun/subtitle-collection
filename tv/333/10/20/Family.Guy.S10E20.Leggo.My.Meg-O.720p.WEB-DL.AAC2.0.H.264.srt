# It seems today
that all you see #

2
00:00:04,898 --> 00:00:08,217
# Is violence in movies
and sex on TV #

3
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:11,687
# But where are those
good old-fashioned values #

4
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:14,757
# On which we used to rely? #

5
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:18,550
# Lucky there's a family guy #

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,753
# Lucky there's a man
who positively can do #

00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,355
# All the things that make us #

8
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:24,773
# Laugh and cry #

Fam... ily... Guy! #

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,417
All right, ladies,

13
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:37,236
let's pick teams
for dodgeball.

14
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,637
Connie, would you like
to be a captain?

15
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:39,338
Sure.

16
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,340
I pick everyone
except Meg.

17
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,041
Fair enough. Go!

18
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,813
Oww!

19
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:00,125
Hey, where's
everybody going?

20
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,727
That's not how we end
this class.

21
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:04,637
Good job today.

22
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:05,871
Good job today.

23
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:07,197
Great class.

24
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:08,281
Nice hustle.

25
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,542
Hey, how was gym class?

26
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:14,332
Terrible.

27
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:15,466
You know, I don't think
I can take

28
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,517
another semester
at this school, Ruth.

29
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:18,019
It's torture.

30
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:20,788
It's worse than sitting
next to a baby on an airplane.

31
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:23,658
So what brings you
to Kentucky?

32
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:24,892
I'm visiting my family.

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,527
Ah, family man.

34
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:28,996
Me? Single
and ready to mingle.

35
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:31,866
Tom Brunell's the name.
Insurance is the game.

36
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:35,636
And right now,
the game is very good to me.

37
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:36,854
Hey, I know!

38
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:37,955
If you hate it
so much here,

39
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:39,056
why don't you
come to Paris

40
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:40,441
for a semester
with me instead?

41
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,626
I'm leaving next week.

42
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:43,427
You're going to Paris
for a semester?

43
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,496
Yeah, it's a program
sponsored by the high school.

44
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,164
My aunt even has
an apartment there

45
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,666
that we can stay in
for free.

46
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,135
Oh, my God,
that sounds so amazing!

47
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:52,653
Excuse me,
I was wondering

48
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:55,223
if you would go to the dance
with me on Friday.

49
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:56,774
Chris, it's me, Meg.

50
00:01:57,676 --> 00:01:58,809
Well, that's everybody.

51
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,550
<i>We now return
to Ethiopian Hoarders.</i>

52
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,054
I don't know
how it got like this!

53
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:11,622
Dad, Mom,

54
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,057
there's something
I want to ask you.

55
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:14,291
Can I go to school
in Paris

56
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:15,292
for a semester?

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,727
What? Paris?

58
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:18,529
Hey, you know,
I have a pen pal in Paris.

59
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:19,980
Would you mind bringing him
this letter?

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,284
We're fighting.

61
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,803
Meg, I'd love to send you
to Paris for a semester,

62
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,221
but we can't afford that.

63
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:28,489
But I can pay
for it myself.

64
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:30,257
I've been saving up
from all my part-time jobs.

65
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:31,659
That's smart of you, Meg.

66
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:32,860
You know, sometimes I do

67
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:35,029
part-time jobs
for extra cash.

68
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,200
Gimme money. Gimme money.
Gimme money...

69
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,058
You be careful,
sweetie,

70
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,760
and call us as soon
as the plane lands.

71
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:51,111
Okay, Mom, I will.

72
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:52,513
I'll miss you, Dad.

73
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:54,682
I've never been very good
at saying good-bee.

74
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,467
Good-bee, Meg.

75
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:57,801
And I'm gonna
bring you back

76
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:59,587
something special,
little guy.

77
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:01,889
Don't worry about me.
Just get yourself laid.

78
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:04,191
Will you get me
French Stewart's autograph?

79
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,826
Say hello
to the Pont Neuf for me,

80
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,062
or as I like to call it,
my inspiration point...

81
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:09,129
Oh, you're gone.

82
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:10,531
And the family's gone.

83
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:21,152
Oh, my God, we're
actually here in Paris.

84
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:23,060
This is so exciting!

85
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,528
Good day, foreigners.

86
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,498
On behalf of the country
of France, we surrender.

87
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:30,500
Oh, my God,
I love your breath.

88
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:33,320
Hi, I'm Meg.
This is my friend, Ruth.

89
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:35,299
Would you ladies
like to share a cab,

90
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:38,085
Or as we say,
"sharre a cabbuh"?

91
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:39,086
Sure.

92
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:40,354
That sounds great.

93
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:42,289
Oh, and please
do not be suspicious

94
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:43,791
that I am
at the airport

95
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:45,593
with no baggage
whatsoever.

96
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:50,664
A cool name to say
with a French accent

97
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,633
is Ashtahn Kootchere.

98
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:56,620
Bye!

99
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:57,671
Thanks!

100
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:02,326
Hey, it's me.

101
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:04,061
I've got
some fresh arrivals for you.

102
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,729
How are they?

103
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:07,298
On a scale from un to dix,

104
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:10,200
they're about a trois.

105
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:13,354
Wow, this place
is awesome!

106
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,422
I know!

107
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,124
Hey, you wanna dance around
like morons to loud music?

108
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:19,359
I'll be right back.

109
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:21,679
I've been holding in
a dump since America.

110
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,102
Griffin residence.

111
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,369
Hi, Dad, it's me.

112
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:31,338
Just wanted you to know
I got here safe.

113
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:32,106
And sound?

114
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:34,108
Yes, Dad, and sound.

115
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,242
Oh, good.

116
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,294
The "sound" is what concerns me.

117
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:39,196
- Oh, it's so amazing here, Dad.
- Yep.

118
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:40,798
- You should see it.
- Uh-huh.

119
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:42,399
- The apartment we're staying
in is huge...- Uh-huh.

120
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:43,767
- and has an incredible view of...
- Uh-huh.

121
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:46,103
Dad, something's
going on.

122
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,304
Some men just broke in.

123
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:51,942
Oh, my God!
They've got Ruth!

124
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:55,662
And now, I think
they're coming after me!

125
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,597
All right, Meg,

126
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:58,999
I need you to listen to me
very carefully:

127
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,100
panic.

128
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:01,535
Pay no attention to detail.

129
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:03,303
Let your mind race.

130
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,105
Take short, rapid breaths.

131
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:06,774
Then hide under the bed,

132
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:08,675
but leave two of your feet
sticking out.

133
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,099
Oh, my God, Dad!

134
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:18,118
Are they gonna take me?
I'm so scared!

135
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:21,021
Meg? Meg?

136
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,695
I don't know who you are.
I don't know what you want.

137
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,698
But I have a very particular
lack of skills.

138
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,084
I will never be able
to find you,

139
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,036
but what I do have
is two dollars

140
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:37,638
and a Casio wristwatch.

141
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,523
You can have one of them.

142
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,925
Drakkar Noir.

143
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:44,761
These guys are serious.

144
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:46,497
Lois, Meg's dead!

145
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:52,169
Please, there's gotta be
something you can do!

146
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:54,438
My little girl is
in terrible danger!

147
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:55,973
Ma'am, the men
who took your daughter

148
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,241
are most likely members

149
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,209
of a sophisticated network
of human smugglers.

150
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:01,178
If she's not found
within 96 hours,

151
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:03,380
chances are
she's gone forever.

152
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:04,815
Then we've gotta hurry!

153
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:06,350
Sorry, we can't
begin our search

154
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:08,552
until she's been missing
for 96 hours.

155
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,721
Oh, my God! My baby!

156
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,790
Yeah, there's a pretty grisly
sex trade over there.

157
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:15,626
Usually we just end up
burying framed pictures.

158
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:17,561
Oh, Peter!
This is a nightmare!

159
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:22,766
What's going on
down there?

160
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:23,801
Are they gonna find her?

161
00:06:23,868 --> 00:06:24,935
Doesn't look good.

162
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:28,505
Stewie, I think there's only one way
we're ever gonna see Meg again.

163
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:30,974
You and I have to take matters
into our own hands.

164
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,276
What? What are you
talking about?

165
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:33,894
Look, you're the only one
who's got the know-how

166
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:35,879
and the technology
to help us track her down.

167
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:37,397
Hmm. Interesting.

168
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,716
Last week, all my gadgets
were "hooey,"

169
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:40,701
I think was the word.

170
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:42,686
- I didn't say...
- You said "hooey"!

171
00:06:42,754 --> 00:06:43,921
All right, I've booked us
on a flight

172
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,522
that leaves in two hours,

173
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,058
so, um, whose credit card
shall we put it on?

174
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,693
Just put it on yours
and I'll pay you back.

175
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:51,195
Yeah, I feel like
when that happens,

176
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,163
I sometimes don't
get paid back.

177
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,031
Like when?

178
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,367
Jersey Boys, Morton's
Steakhouse, Foxwoods...

179
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:58,469
Foxwoods and Jersey Boys
was the same trip!

180
00:06:58,536 --> 00:06:59,970
You know what? Fine.

181
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:01,622
I'll-I'll put it
on my card,

182
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,257
but I-I-I'm just gonna say
it's a gift

183
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:05,159
because that's the only way
I can do this anymore.

184
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,397
All right, the first thing
we've got to do when we land

185
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,249
is check the apartment
where Meg was abducted

186
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:16,583
and see if we can find
some clues.

187
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:18,318
That sounds good.
That's what I was thinking.

188
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,487
Excuse me, do you mind
if we switch seats

189
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:22,489
so my family can sit
all together?

190
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:24,491
No, we don't...
we-we don't switch.

191
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,826
'Cause when we booked,

192
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:27,394
they didn't have
three together...

193
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:29,062
Ma'am, ma'am,
your poor planning

194
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,064
does not constitute
an emergency for me.

195
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:33,767
You'll see him in Paris.
Go sit down.

196
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:36,403
God, Meg's kidnappers could be
anywhere in France by now.

197
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,305
Well, we do have
one lead, Brian.

198
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:40,374
I have a recording
of the kidnapper's voice.

199
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:42,159
What? You do? How?

200
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,510
I recorded
the kidnapper's phone call

201
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:44,711
with the fat man.

202
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,079
You see, Brian,
I record

203
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:48,448
all phone calls coming in
or out of the house.

204
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:49,983
Y-Y-You do?

205
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:52,352
Yep. This one's
one of my faves.

206
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,555
<i>Hello, Fundamental Industries.
How can I help you?</i>

207
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:58,959
<i>Yeah, um, is this... is this
Bang Brothers? - Yes.</i>

208
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:01,395
<i>Oh. Okay. I-I-I'd like
to cancel my subscription.</i>

209
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:02,529
<i>Uh, what's your name?</i>

210
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:03,864
<i>Brian Griffin.</i>

211
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:05,265
<i>And which site
did you belong to?</i>

212
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,768
<i>Uh... Captain Stabbin'.</i>

213
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:09,403
<i>And how are you spelling that?</i>

214
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,905
<i>Uh... uh, "Captain", full word,</i>

215
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:16,307
<i>then "Stabbin',
"S-T-A-B-B-I-N apostrophe.</i>

216
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,445
<i>Okay, I'm checking.</i>

217
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:22,049
<i>You know, in-instead
of a "G" at the end.</i>

218
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:23,917
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not finding that site.</i>

219
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:25,452
<i>Uh, what was the subject matter?</i>

220
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,121
<i>Um... a guy
doing chicks on a boat</i>

221
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:29,856
<i>in a, uh, captain's hat.</i>

222
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:31,925
<i>Okay, I'm checking.</i>

223
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:33,494
<i>The, um...</i>

224
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:35,529
<i>the, passengers had, uh,
just signed up</i>

225
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:37,130
<i>for a tour of the harbor</i>

226
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,499
<i>and then
all that stuff happened.</i>

227
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:40,767
Okay, you made
your point.

228
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:50,410
Well, this is where
Meg was staying.

229
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:52,612
Oh. I thought Paris would be
a bit more picturesque.

230
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,914
Instead it's just traffic

231
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:56,383
and some big guy
using a jackhammer.

232
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:58,618
But monsieur,
ziss is not a jackhammer.

233
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:00,620
It is a "Jacqueshammer."

234
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:03,957
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-

235
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,226
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho...

236
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:10,480
Oh, God, it's worse
than I imagined.

237
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:11,765
You know, maybe
it'd help

238
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,734
if we just tried
to track Meg's movements

239
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:15,052
from the moment
she arrived in France.

240
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,269
That's a good idea, Brian.

241
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:17,688
Let's try Google Earth.

242
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:18,689
Worth a shot.

243
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:22,559
There. Enhance.

244
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,835
Wow, I never knew you could
do this on a computer.

245
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,220
'Course not, you spend
all your time on this

246
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:34,788
watching Captain Stabbin'.

247
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:36,757
All right, we've got
to find this man.

248
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:39,025
Let's see, this was
taken at the airport.

249
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:40,460
He could be
some sort of lookout

250
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:42,262
who spots girls
fresh off the plane.

251
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,431
Yes, you're probably right,
Brian. Such scum.

252
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:46,133
I'll bet they target
young girls

253
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,502
the way Army commercials
target minorities.

254
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,773
Hey. Other black guys.
It ain't so bad.

255
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:02,299
Oh, my God, Stewie!
There he is!

256
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,017
Hey, buddy, we've got
a few questions for you!

257
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:07,888
Excuse me, but this is
a "smoking only" area.

258
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,523
Oh, sorry.
Do you have a, uh...

259
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:15,512
You know, I really only smoke
when I drink.

260
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,931
Oh. Well, this is nice.

261
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:20,066
This is a nice way
to do this.

262
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:22,636
Look, we need to know:
have you seen this girl?

263
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:25,839
Quick!
He's getting away!

264
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:31,751
Oh, no, he's one of those
parkour, free-running guys.

265
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:32,712
We'll never catch him!

266
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:43,039
Oh, no. I have
chateau'ed myself.

267
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:47,010
Damn it. He died before he could
tell us anything.

268
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,044
Brian, he's
the first guy.

269
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:49,713
The first guy
always dies.

270
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:51,264
Well, I'm sure
he didn't work alone.

271
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:52,883
Maybe there's something
in here we can use.

272
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,101
Ugh, this guy has
a Velcro wallet.

273
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,136
Grow up.

274
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:02,292
All right, this is the address
that was in his wallet.

275
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,677
Yeah, but how are we
gonna know for sure

276
00:11:03,744 --> 00:11:05,061
if these are the guys
who took Meg?

277
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:07,714
Well, we have the kidnapper's
voice on tape, remember?

278
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:10,138
Drakkar Noir.

279
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:11,903
I can use the voice
recognition software

280
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,771
in this recorder
to confirm a match.

281
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,555
Now, here.
Take this briefcase.

282
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,375
We're Eastern European
cologne salesmen.

283
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:20,043
We ask them
what they want,

284
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,378
and when they say
"Drakkar Noir"--

285
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:22,479
which they all will--

286
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:24,181
we'll know
if we have our man.

287
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:26,700
Drakkar Noir?

288
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:31,638
All right, well, that's not him,
but this is gonna be easy.

289
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:36,209
Well, gentlemen,
now that you have smelled

290
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:38,445
all of our colognes,
what'll it be?

291
00:11:38,513 --> 00:11:40,080
I will take
some Drakkar Noir.

292
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:42,983
How 'bout you?

293
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,351
I am disgusting,

294
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,419
so I will take
two bottle Drakkar Noir.

295
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:48,922
How 'bout you, chief?

296
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,623
Hmm.

297
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:52,392
Let me quickly grow beard
and think about it.

298
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,429
I will take Drakkar Noir.

299
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:15,114
What the hell
are you doing?!

300
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:16,316
We haven't eaten
since the plane.

301
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,367
I'm starving.

302
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:28,828
Where is this girl?

303
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:29,863
Where is she?!

304
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,697
We keep girls upstairs.

305
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,799
I hope you burn in hell
along with the guy

306
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,302
who came up with
stuffing a turkey.

307
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,604
Hey!

308
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:40,673
Who wants to try
some of my "Butthole Bread"?

309
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:43,759
Meg?

310
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:44,677
Meg?

311
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,264
Help... me.

312
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,765
Oh, we're here to help
somebody else, sweetheart.

313
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:52,068
Go, go, go, go. Don't...
Don't look at her.

314
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:53,419
Don't look at her.
That was my mistake.

315
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:58,808
Stewie, I don't see
Meg anywhere.

316
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,009
Brian, look!

317
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,898
Oh, my God!

318
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:05,915
Meg!

319
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:06,716
What the hell?

320
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:07,851
Where'd you get that hat?

321
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,519
Uh, a girl
gave it to me.

322
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:10,737
Well, what did she
look like?

323
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:12,806
She had a great
personality.

324
00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:14,040
That's her.

325
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,475
Where is she?
Is she here?

326
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:18,011
No, uh, they took her
just a little while ago.

327
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,846
Every Wednesday night,

328
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:21,081
they auction
some of the girls off.

329
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:22,182
Wednesday?

330
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:23,249
What a weird night

331
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:24,984
to auction girls off
into slavery.

332
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:26,519
Well, you know,
on the weekend,

333
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:27,487
people probably
have plans.

334
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:28,722
Have plans?

335
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:29,956
What are you doing
that's more important

336
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:31,291
than buying somebody?

337
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:32,409
Look, where is
this place?

338
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:33,443
Where do they have
the auction?

339
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:34,544
I don't know,

340
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:36,379
but there is
a courtesy shuttle

341
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:37,814
that runs
every 20 minutes.

342
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:38,982
What?

343
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:42,585
Aw, damn it.
We just missed it.

344
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:44,020
What do you wanna do
for 20 minutes?

345
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,021
Well, I don't know
'bout you,

346
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:46,156
but I'm gonna work out.

347
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:47,490
That's how you stay in shape.

348
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:49,075
You just fit it in
when you have free time,

349
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:50,343
wherever you are,
wherever you can.

350
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:52,095
There's semen on this floor.

351
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,333
Stewie, look!

352
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,103
We gotta get in there!

353
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:02,655
Hey, got one more here!

354
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:03,957
Oh, where are we?

355
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:05,375
I'm from Atlanta.

356
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:07,210
I don't know
where we are!

357
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,345
Hey, you better hurry.
They're starting soon.

358
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:11,614
You know what's messed up?

359
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:12,916
This is all for charity.

360
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:15,017
All the proceeds
are going to Oxfam.

361
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:26,079
I hope we're not too late.

362
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:27,097
You should not
be out here.

363
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:28,965
- Bidding is about to start.
- What the hell?

364
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,867
Stewie!

365
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:39,392
The current bid is $200,000.

366
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,527
Oh, my God.

367
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:43,163
Going once, twice...

368
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,598
Sold for $200,000.

369
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:50,052
Remember: There is cash back
when you use your Visa Gold.

370
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:53,520
Our next item appears to be
a late entry.

371
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:55,246
It is not in the catalog.

372
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:56,192
What the hell?

373
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,927
All right, fellas,
bring the lights up a bit,

374
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:00,530
play the CD I gave you
and let's do this!

375
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,332
("California Gurls"
by Katy Perry playing)

376
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,667
# California girls,
we're unforgettable #

377
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:07,120
Ah, that's right.
You like that?

378
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:09,572
I have $50,000.
# Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top #

379
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:11,591
I have $75,000.
# Sun-kissed skin so hot #

380
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:13,259
Thank you, Brett Ratner.
# We'll melt your popsicle... #

381
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:14,911
Do I have $100,000?

382
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:17,246
Oh, for God's sake.
$500,000.

383
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:19,716
We have $500,000.

384
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:22,577
Going once, going twice,

385
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:26,139
sold to the man
who doesn't quite get auctions.

386
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:27,941
That was so fun.

387
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,525
How do you be paying?

388
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:31,194
Oh, I, uh, I don't
have any money.

389
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,562
Can we work it out,

390
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,764
uh, maybe, some...
other way?

391
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:36,182
Wait a minute.

392
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,384
Something doesn't
smell funny here.

393
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:39,652
You're not Arab!

394
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,538
You two are coming
with me.

395
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:43,006
This next girl is perfect

396
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,375
for those of you
who want to buy a sex slave

397
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:48,044
but don't want to spend
sex-slave money.

398
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:49,245
Oh, my God, Meg!

399
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:51,347
Wonder what music
they're gonna use for her?

400
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:55,985
("Let's Make A Deal"
zonk musical cue playing)

401
00:15:58,088 --> 00:15:59,255
Huh, seems about right.

402
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:09,204
Damn it. We were so close
to saving Meg.

403
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:10,822
Hey, where's my sister?

404
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:14,359
She's probably having
her shish kabobbed as we speak.

405
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,962
I heard that from Samantha
in Sex and the City 2.

406
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,830
Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba,
I haven't seen it yet.

407
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:20,365
That doesn't hurt
the story.

408
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:22,017
And now prepare to...

409
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:25,087
We have a jail cell.

410
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:26,371
I always tell them,

411
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,373
"Put the prisoners
in the jail cell,"

412
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:30,976
but they always say,
"Just chain 'em up to a pipe."

413
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:32,227
Idiots.

414
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,130
Hey, that was some
good teamwork, Brian.

415
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:36,631
We were like Lewis and Clark

416
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,684
and the guy who likes
to tip over canoes.

417
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,652
Ugh, these rapids
are treacherous.

418
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,604
We should reach calmer waters
by nightfall.

419
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:44,189
Uh-oh!
Earthquake!

420
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,207
Hey, come on!

421
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,492
Careful!

422
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:50,328
Damn it. Why is he
still with us?

423
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,096
I know!

424
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:52,798
Until now, walking
to the other end

425
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:54,967
of the United States seemed
like such a good job.

426
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,670
There she is! Hurry!

427
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:02,424
Stewie, what are you doing?

428
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,459
We'll never catch
a speeding car on foot.

429
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:06,061
Haven't you ever seen
an action movie?

430
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:10,282
All we have to do is cut diagonally
across any nearby field.

431
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:16,405
See?

432
00:17:24,914 --> 00:17:27,299
Aw, crap, they're taking her
onto that yacht.

433
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:34,706
All right, we just gotta
catch up to the boat.

434
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:35,924
Well, how we
gonna do that?

435
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:38,827
Oh, cool!
They got Car Chase GPS.

436
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,681
<i>Back up dangerously into traffic.</i>

437
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,840
<i>Proceed wrong way
down busy street for 500 meters.</i>

438
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,765
<i>Say "hang on"
and drive down staircase.</i>

439
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,984
Hang on!

440
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:14,079
<i>Poorly edited shot where driver
is obviously stuntperson.</i>

441
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:28,209
<i>Leave fart in closed car
like a dick.</i>

442
00:18:28,277 --> 00:18:29,444
Sorry about that!

443
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:34,016
All right, they're probably
holding her below deck.

444
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,934
You take the right side.
I'll take the left.

445
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:37,319
You're gonna need this.

446
00:18:37,403 --> 00:18:39,137
What? I-I-I've never
killed anybody before.

447
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:40,355
Relax, they're Arabs.

448
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,358
People will still be rooting
for you.

449
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:43,859
Hey!

450
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:47,496
Son of a bitch.

451
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:51,850
Oh. This is like
a video game.

452
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:56,421
Ah, I'm kinda good at this.

453
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:00,842
Later, dink.

454
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,101
That's for shooting
one of our guys!

455
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,570
- We got you!
- In your face!

456
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:29,788
- Our boat!
- Our boat!

457
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,156
This boat!

458
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,694
Let me go,
you fat bastard!

459
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:37,663
I will never be
your sex slave!

460
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,247
You misunderstand.

461
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,500
I did not buy you
to be my slave.

462
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:44,369
I bought you for my son,
and not to be his slave,

463
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:46,605
but to be his wife.

464
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:47,606
Wife?

465
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:48,607
Faisal!

466
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,644
This is Faisal,

467
00:19:52,712 --> 00:19:54,680
my son and the heir
to my throne.

468
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:57,516
My father was correct.

469
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,885
Your beauty
knows no bounds.

470
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:01,987
Fair goddess,
it is my hope

471
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:03,522
that you will agree
to be my wife,

472
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:05,357
but the choice is yours.

473
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:06,692
If you say "no,"

474
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,260
I will have you flown back
to your family

475
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:09,728
on our private jet.

476
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:11,229
But if you say "yes,"

477
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,198
I will spend
the rest of my days

478
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:15,617
making your every wish
come true.

479
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:18,954
Will you be my wife,
Princess Meg?

480
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:20,989
Oh, yes! Yes!

481
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:27,429
Nooooo!

482
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:31,550
- Stewie?
- Hi, Meg.

483
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:39,189
Oh honey, we are so glad
to have you back

484
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:41,085
but you really don't
remember anything?

485
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,340
Not really, Mom.

486
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,275
I mean, one minute,
I was being proposed to

487
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,011
by a handsome
Arabian prince,

488
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,212
and the next thing
I know,

489
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,114
I'm waking up
in a French hospital.

490
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,949
Oh, and we heard
from Ruth's parents.

491
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,584
She had her tongue ripped out.

492
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,754
I guess we got off easy, huh?

493
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,955
Well, we put all your mail

494
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,756
on the desk in your room,
sweetheart.

495
00:20:58,824 --> 00:20:59,658
Thanks, Dad.

496
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,392
I'm kidding.
You didn't get any mail.

497
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:05,993
