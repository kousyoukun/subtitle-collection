00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:34,759
Hello, I'm Brian Griffin.
And I'm Stewie Griffin.

13
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:37,529
A few years ago, we did an
episode called "Viewer Mail"

14
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:40,098
where you, our fans,
wrote in and suggested ideas

15
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,716
for new episodes.

16
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:44,553
Well, it's ten years later, but
you're still sending in ideas.

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,289
Uh, to Rashad in Little Rock,
we wanna let you know

18
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:50,942
we kicked around idea, "Make the
Baby Go Wild" for a while,

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,061
couldn't really find
an angle on it.

20
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:55,330
Here's one from
Lee Mills of Iowa.

21
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:58,233
Lee writes: "Dear <i>Family</i> <i>Guy,</i>
was your show based on anything?"

22
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:59,951
That's a great question, Lee.

23
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,787
In fact, Family Guy is based
on an American television series

24
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,756
called <i>The</i> <i>Simpsons.</i>

25
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:07,909
(chuckles) Actually, <i>Family</i> <i>Guy,</i>
much like <i>The Office,</i>

26
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:10,028
is based on a British series
called <i>Chap of the Manor.</i>

27
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:11,446
Let's watch.

28
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,585
(farting)

29
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,156
ANNOUNCER:
<i>We now return to Britain's</i>

30
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:22,857
<i>most popular game show...</i>

31
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:26,328
BRITISH AUDIENCE:
<i>Wheel... of... Politeness!</i>

32
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:28,096
Do go ahead, then.
Oh, no, you first.

33
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:30,065
Wouldn't dream of it.
Too kind, really, I insist.

34
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,133
Wouldn't be proper of me.
I appreciate your courtesy.

35
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,401
Likewise.
Well, we're all out of time.

36
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,903
Join us same time tomorrow

37
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:36,938
if it's not entirely
inconvenient for you.

38
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,306
If so, of course,
we do understand

39
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:40,108
and we do apologize in advance.

40
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:42,844
This has all been an imposition.
I'm so dreadfully sorry.

41
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,645
Sorry! Sorry.
Sorry.

44
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:49,084
I hope everyone's peckish
for some boiled lamb shank.

45
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,385
None for me, Lydia.

46
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:52,053
I'm meeting me mates
down at the pub.

47
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:54,406
Again? But Neville,
you spend all your time

48
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:57,008
down at the Fox and Pig
and Dog and Wolf and Cat

49
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,176
and Fiddle and
Whistle and Cock.

50
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,527
And that's where
you're wrong.

51
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:01,663
The Fox and Pig and Dog
and Wolf and Cat

52
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,582
and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock
is for tossers.

53
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:05,834
We're meetin' at the Dog and Cat
and Bull and Whistle

54
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:07,836
and Fiddle and Cock
and Pig and Wolf and Carriage

55
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:09,371
and Fife and Other Wolf!

56
00:02:09,438 --> 00:02:11,890
But I need you to stay and have
a chat with Collingsworth.

57
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,092
I found him with another fag
in his mouth this morning.

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,427
Oh, is that right?

59
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:17,362
So you fancy fags, do you?

60
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,898
Well, here.
Have a whole carton of fags!

61
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,984
I just want a comely lass
to look upon me with favour.

62
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,486
I look on you with favour.

63
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:26,137
I look on all of you
with favour.

64
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:27,706
Shut up, British Meg.

65
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,807
(Texas accent)
Look at Lydia.

66
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:31,376
What a two-bit Wichita whore.

67
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,678
One of these days,
she's gonna wake up <i>killt.</i>

68
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:35,146
Ah, matricide.

69
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:37,182
Yet another of
your childhood whims.

70
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:38,917
No, it ain't. I'm gonna follow
through with...

71
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,218
Wait, why'd you say it
like that?

72
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:43,188
Cutaway, sir?

73
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:45,290
Yes, that's good then.

74
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:48,193
Friends, family,
and characters random

75
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,029
To bring you joy
and laughter in tandem

76
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:53,865
To divert and dazzle
is our intention

77
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:57,185
So sit back, relax,
and enjoy our invention.

78
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,223
Ah, I love summer.

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,268
Good evening, Billingsbury.
I'm Clive Crowley.

80
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,804
Coming up: a man with a gun
and two bullets

81
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:17,972
has taken over the city
of Manchester.

82
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,709
But first, our top story
tonight: Her Majesty, the Queen,

83
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:23,011
will be passing through
our very town tomorrow.

84
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,946
With details, we now go live

85
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:26,915
to Indian reporter,
Tricia Dasgupta.

86
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:29,651
Oh, my golly,
there is much commotion.

87
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,319
Thank you, Tricia.
After the interval,

88
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:34,189
find out which 12 football teams
tied tonight.

89
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,124
The Queen's comin'
to Billingsbury?

90
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:37,826
That's bloody sweet!

91
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,961
You know, I'm actually a
relation of the royal family.

92
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,830
You most certainly are not.

93
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:43,631
Where would you
get that idea?

94
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,633
Me mum used to claim
she was a Windsor.

95
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,536
And I always heard my Nana talk
about how she took a duke.

96
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,138
Must've been a difficult
marriage, too,

97
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,906
'cause every afternoon
she'd be belly-achin'

98
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:53,475
about her bloody duke.

99
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,610
I think you just had
a gross grandmother.

100
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:57,879
No, I'm quite sure of it.
And to prove it,

101
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,914
I'm gonna nick
one of the Queen's hairs

102
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:01,533
during her visit tomorrow.

103
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,486
And when the DNA proves a match,
you'll see I'm royalty.

104
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:05,954
The Queen, eh?

105
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,156
I'd like to mash my banger
in her blood pudding.

106
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:09,257
Googity. Googity. Glop.

107
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:11,476
Hello, lads.
Oh, hello, Seamus.

108
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,912
Right fine performance
at the cricket match today.

109
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,981
Aye. I was spirited to have you
down there watching me.

110
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,850
P.A. ANNOUNCER:
Well, it's a brilliant day

111
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,118
for a long and
confusing game of cricket.

112
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,153
The field is teeming
with men in helmets

113
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,822
who don't seem like
they need helmets,

114
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,390
and men not in helmets

115
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,858
who seem like they probably
should be wearing helmets.

116
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:29,828
Oh, he's batted it
clear out of the stadium.

117
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,331
Is that good? We don't know,
but it's what we do!

118
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,733
Y-Yay!

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,667
Boo!
Boo!

120
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:36,668
Boo!

121
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,791
Oh my goodness, the Queen is
going to be here presently.

122
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,626
This is oh-so-exciting!

123
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:46,861
My favorite part
before the Queen arrives

124
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:49,631
is yelling "wanker"
at Prince Charles as he passes.

125
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,049
Wanker!
Wanker!

126
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:52,784
I know, I know.

127
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,085
Wanker!
Wanker!

128
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:55,953
Yes, I know. Yes.

129
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,472
Wanker!
You're a wanker!

130
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:59,390
Wanker!
Right, quite right.

131
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,009
Spot on. He's got it.

132
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:03,762
I say, a lot of people have
turned out to see the Queen.

133
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,130
Should make for a grand day.

134
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,982
Hey, watch it there!

135
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:18,193
Good show, old chap.
Well played.

136
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,327
Here she comes!

137
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:20,829
(crowd cheering)

138
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:24,816
Very well.
Time for action.

139
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:28,019
A lock of the Queen's hair
shall soon be mine.

140
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,838
Here she comes.
Have at it then.

141
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:32,891
Crikey! This is a haircut
fit for a queen!

142
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,178
Oh, bloody hell!

143
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,247
All right, time for Plan B.
Let's go!

144
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:48,490
I'm not going any lower.

145
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,441
Well, Father,
you gave it a good go.

146
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:53,344
Oh, we're not done yet.
Come on!

147
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,946
(tires squeal)

148
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:58,233
Queen! Queen! Give me
some of your hair!

149
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,318
Come on, Queen!
Don't be a bitch!

150
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:02,036
Get us away
from that lunatic!

151
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,505
(tires squeal)

152
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,798
She's heading into that tunnel!

153
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:18,469
(crashing, horse neighs)

154
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:21,339
GUARD (screaming):
Dear God! The Queen's dead!

155
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:24,342
(both whistling)

156
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:26,544
All right, Collingsworth,
I got a hair.

157
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,064
Now, just walk away casual-like
and we're in the clear.

to <i>The Comedy Central Roast</i>
<i>of Robin Williams.</i>

Aw, man, Robin Williams
is my favorite!

177
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:23,845

178

to show business.

I don't think
that's what a roast is.

180
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:30,152
Robin, as a comic, it's an honor
to be up here roasting you.

181
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,387
As a moviegoer, I want
to punch you in the face.

188
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:46,701
Robin Williams has a manic gift
that gladdens a sad world

189
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,639
and all he asks in return
is our unceasing attention!

190
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:52,540
How can you allow this?!

191
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:55,560

nothing but joy!

What numbers?
No idea.

202
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:27,175
Well, congratulations.
You're gonna be just fine.

316
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,873
Und vere are your papers?

317
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,941
Are you from
East or Vest Berlin?

318
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,677
(a la John Wayne):
Vell, I'm from Vest Berlin, pilgrim.

319
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:42,414
(sobbing)

320
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,765
Shut up!

321
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,133
(yelling)

322
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:48,186
(sobbing)

323
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,671
Ho-ho! Ho-ho!
Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

324
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:52,991
Stop riffing!

325
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:57,312
Jump, Forest, jump!

326
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:58,797
Must be a leap
year, ho-ho!

327
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,455
Time to lose
some weight, dearie?

328
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:10,558
No... more... comedy.

329
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:17,832
Guys, will you please
settle down?

330
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:19,367
Can we, can we settle down,
please?

331
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:20,685
Every... everyone.

332
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:22,086
Everyone, can I have
your attention?

333
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:23,488
Oh, Captains! My Captains!

334
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:26,541
I have an announcement to make:

335
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:28,042
You are all free!

336
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,111
You have been fired
from the school.

337
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,865
Vietnam is over.
The hospital is closing.

338
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,900
Will Hunting is all better.

339
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:37,569
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

340
00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:39,704
Shut up. Seriously, shut up.

341
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,206
Please, you are done here.

342
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:44,509
Go and spread your comedy
to all corners of this country.

343
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:49,013
Wait, not you five.

344
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:52,217
I'm gonna keep you for...
an experiment.

345
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:55,253
Ho-ho! Eggs!

346
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:57,105
Who came first, the chicken
or the porn star?

347
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:58,206
Ho-ho!
<i>The Porn Identity!</i>

348
00:13:58,274 --> 00:13:59,507
Who am I? Oh, yeah!
The pizza man!

349
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:01,743
Baka-chikka-bwow-bwow!
Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

350
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,011
Peter, can you pass
the coffee?

351
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:05,713
Sure, Brian the dog.

352
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:10,635
Anything for my family.

353
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,804
Coffee now.
Here we go, here we go.

354
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:18,759
I guess Disney wouldn't let us
do the <i>Aladdin</i> one.

355
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:31,150
LOIS:
Stewie, rise and shine.

356
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,755
Good morning, Stewie.

357
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:37,023
(bleep) you.

358
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,208
You ready for the day, sweetie?

359
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:41,577
Oh, someone needs
a diaper change.

360
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,584
Are you proud
of yourself?

361
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:49,936
That this
is what you do?

362
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:52,054
Is this a dime?
Did you swallow a dime?

363
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:54,574
Yeah, wipe it off
and put it back in your purse,

364
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:55,942
you white trash hen.

365
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:57,176
There we go.

366
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,762
Who's my clean little boy?

367
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:01,280
(Stewie laughing)

368
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,734
Ugh! Your roots
are ridiculous.

369
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:05,885
I'm gonna grab
your hair 'cause

370
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:07,019
I like grabbing stuff.

371
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,455
Okay. Okay, Stewie, let go.

372
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,641
Let, let go, Stewie.
Let go of Mommy's hair.

373
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,843
When I grow up, I'm
never gonna call you.

374
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:16,112
I'm gonna be busy
with my job and my family.

375
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,847
You'll be nothing.

376
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:25,788
Stewie, I want you
to have my ring.

377
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,607
It's one of my most
important possessions,

378
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:29,475
and I want you to have it.

379
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:32,111
Okay, red flag.
Red flag, everybody!

380
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,267
Hey, Stewie,
wanna go down the slide?

381
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:39,919
STEWIE:
Um...

382
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:41,120
What's the matter?

383
00:15:41,188 --> 00:15:42,989
Ya never been down
the slide before?

384
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:44,924
(scoffs) Yeah, like,
like a thousand times.

385
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:48,160
Just done it so much
I'm bored with it, that's all.

386
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:52,632
All right, I guess
we're doing this.

387
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:57,169
Whoa.

388
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:58,921
Come on down,
Stewie!

389
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:01,207
(hawks screeching)

390
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,694
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy.

391
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:08,631
All right, you can do this,
Stewie. Here we go.

392
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:09,699
(screams)

393
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:11,584
(thud)

394
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:12,618
Are you okay?

395
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:14,086
Yeah, that wasn't so bad.

396
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:15,521
You might wanna move.

397
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,723
That farting Polish kid
is coming down the slide.

398
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,558
(Stewie grunts)
(kid farts)

399
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:20,993
Ah, Pavel!

400
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,295
Hey, kid, come here.
I wanna see

401
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:41,664
if I can still smell
your mom's boobs on your mouth.

402
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,883
Why don't you go hump
a pile of garbage?

403
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:50,423
All right, here we go.
Classic.

404
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:51,824
(engine starts)

405
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:53,426
Uh-oh. (grunts)

406
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:58,597
Oh, God! Brian! Brian!

407
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:03,185
Guess I'm going for a ride.

408
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:12,395
Why are we stopping?

409
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:13,546
(squirrel chitters)

410
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:16,231
Oh, come on.

411
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:20,886
For God's sake, Brian.
It's just a squirrel.

412
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:22,088
BRIAN:
Yeah!

413
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,205
Oh, God!

414
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:28,961
(Stewie groans)

415
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:30,930
He can't hurt you anymore.

416
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:37,036
Hey there, little fella.

417
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:39,638
We sure got a lovely day for it,
don't we?

418
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:41,507
Stay away from
my brother's butt.

419
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:46,395
Okay, Stewie, let's get
that little face washed off.

420
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,631
Then you can play
with your bath toys, huh?

421
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:50,683
No, I hate getting
my face washed!

422
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,485
Oh, look!
It's just Mr. Frog!

423
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:54,403
Hello, Mr. Frog...

424
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:55,654
(spluttering)

425
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:58,140
My God, how the hell
do I keep falling for that?

426
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,825
Now you play with your toys

427
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:02,445
and I'll go get yo
a nice, fluffy towel.

428
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:06,415
Stewart Griffin, explorer,
adventurer,

429
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,634
skin-diving
international playboy.

430
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,720
(takes deep breath)

431
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:15,124
(Stewie growls, screams)

432
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:17,009
I'm swimming at night
'cause I'm a slut

433
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:19,345
and now I'm paying
the price for it.

434
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:21,797
(panting)

435
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:23,599
Hey, Stewie!

436
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,135
Wow, looks like you got
some cool bath toys in there.

437
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:27,937
Is it okay if I join ya?

438
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,605
No! (screams)

439
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,143
Hey, is that
my froggie butt cloth?

440
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,732
Okay, Stewie, bedtime's
in ten minutes.

441
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,066
I'll be right back.

442
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:44,120
Hmm. I think I have time
for a quickie.

443
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:55,347
Excuse me, Mr. Cobain.

444
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:56,515
Look, I know
you're depressed.

445
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,784
Made some bad choices
with women,

446
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:00,069
but there's another way.

447
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:02,655
Haagen-Dazs,
lots of Haagen-Dazs.

448
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:07,059
(whooshing)

449
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:08,611
Well, let's see if it worked.

450
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:10,146
Here we go.

451
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:12,865
Ha! You're still alive,
you fat (bleep).

452
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,117
Okay, Stewie, time for bed.

453
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:17,203
You want Mommy to read you
a night-night story?

454
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,171
Oh, how 'bout this one?

455
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:23,125
<i>"Good Night, Town</i>
<i>from</i> Footloose"?

456
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:25,561
LOIS:

457
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:31,300
Who is this book for?

458
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:41,477
(slurring): Hey, Lois.
I'm home from the Clam.

459
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:43,229
You know what that means.

460
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:46,198
STEWIE: You spent the last ten minutes
parked in front of the house

461
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:47,750
crying in your car?

462
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:50,352
Not now, Peter. I'm doing
story time with Stewie.

463
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,620
Yeah, scram, Drinky.

464
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:52,988
I got a story.

465
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:55,491
It's about the little penis
that could.

466
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,593
It thinks it can, it thinks...

467
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:59,361
In fact, it's pretty sure
it can.

468
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:00,830
It-It, it's gonna.

469
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,364
Hey, am I gonna have
to handle this?

470
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:03,883
Do you want me
to handle this?

471
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,884
Peter, just go wait
in the bedroom.

472
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:06,502
I'll be right there.

473
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:10,339
Fine, but if I gotta pee first,
this night's gonna be ruined.

474
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:11,624
