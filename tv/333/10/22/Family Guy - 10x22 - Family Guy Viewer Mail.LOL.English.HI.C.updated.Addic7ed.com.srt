- 大家好 我是Brian Griffin - 我是Stewie Griffin
- Hello, I'm Brian Griffin. - And I'm Stewie Griffin.

13
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:37,529
几年前 我们制作了一集"观众来信"
A few years ago, we did an episode called "Viewer Mail"

14
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:40,098
你们 我们的粉丝 写信来给我们提出了
where you, our fans, wrote in and suggested ideas

15
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,716
剧集的新创意
for new episodes.

16
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:44,553
现在已经10年了 然你们还是在寄给我们各种创意
Well, it's ten years later, but you're still sending in ideas.

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,289
呃 至小石城的Rashad 我们想告诉你
Uh, to Rashad in Little Rock, we wanna let you know

18
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:50,942
我们讨论了这个"让婴儿放纵一把"的创意很久
we kicked around idea, "Make the Baby Go Wild" for a while,

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,061
但是没有找到一个很合适的角度
couldn't really find an angle on it.

20
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:55,330
这一个是来自爱荷华州的Lee Mills
Here's one from Lee Mills of Iowa.

21
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:58,233
他写道:"亲爱的恶搞之家 你们的剧集是根据什么改变的么"
Lee writes: "Dear <i>Family</i> <i>Guy,</i> was your show based on anything?"

22
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:59,951
这是个好问题 Lee
That's a great question, Lee.

23
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,787
事实上 恶搞之家是源于美国电视剧
In fact, Family Guy is based on an American television series

24
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,756
名叫《辛普森一家》
called <i>The</i> <i>Simpsons.</i>

25
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:07,909
其实 《恶搞之家》更像《办公室》
Actually, <i>Family</i> <i>Guy,</i> much like <i>The Office,</i>

26
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:10,028
是取材于一部英国电视剧《庄园小伙》
is based on a British series called <i>Chap of the Manor.</i>

27
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:10,028
这个名字也是恶搞了family guy

28
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:11,446
我们一起欣赏吧
Let's watch.

29
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,585
(farting)

30
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,156
现在我们继续播放英国
ANNOUNCER:<i>We now return to Britain's</i>

31
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:22,857
最受欢迎的游戏节目
<i>most popular game show...</i>

32
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:26,328
优雅…之…轮
BRITISH AUDIENCE:<i>Wheel... of... Politeness!</i>

33
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:26,328
恶搞了美国的游戏节目幸运之轮

34
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:28,096
- 请开始吧 - 噢 不 您先请
- Do go ahead, then. - Oh, no, you first.

35
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:30,065
- 我从来就没这么想过 - 你真是太好了 但我坚持您先来
- Wouldn't dream of it. - Too kind, really, I insist.

36
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,133
- 这对我来说是不正确的 - 我很感激您的好意
- Wouldn't be proper of me. - I appreciate your courtesy.

37
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,401
- 您也是 - 好吧 时间到
- Likewise. - Well, we're all out of time.

38
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,903
请于明天同一时间继续收看
Join us same time tomorrow

39
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:36,938
如果没有完全为您带来不便的话
if it's not entirely inconvenient for you.

40
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,306
如果有的话 我们当然也理解
If so, of course, we do understand

41
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:40,108
并提前致歉
and we do apologize in advance.

42
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:42,844
这完全就是强加于您的 我感到非常抱歉
This has all been an imposition. I'm so dreadfully sorry.

43
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,645
- 抱歉 - 抱歉 - 抱歉
- Sorry! - Sorry. - Sorry.

44
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:44,846
抱歉了 大家
Sorry, everyone!

45
00:01:44,914 --> 00:01:46,548
好了 孩子们 今天的电视到此为止了
All right, kids, enough telly.

46
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:49,084
我希望大家都想来吃点煮羊腿
I hope everyone's peckish for some boiled lamb shank.

47
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,385
我就不要了 Lydia
None for me, Lydia.

48
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:52,053
我要去酒吧见我的朋友们了
I'm meeting me mates down at the pub.

49
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:54,406
又去? 但是 Neville 你的所有时间
Again? But Neville, you spend all your time

50
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:57,008
都花在了 狐狸与猪与狗与狼与猫
down at the Fox and Pig and Dog and Wolf and Cat

51
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,176
与小提琴与口哨与鸡巴吧了
and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock.

52
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,527
你这么说就错了
And that's where you're wrong.

53
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:01,663
狐狸与猪与狗与狼与猫
The Fox and Pig and Dog and Wolf and Cat

54
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,582
与小提琴与口哨与鸡巴吧是废物去的地方
and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock is for tossers.

55
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:05,834

58
00:02:09,438 --> 00:02:11,890
但我想让你留在家和Collingsworth谈谈
But I need you to stay and have a chat with Collingsworth.

59
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,092
我今天早上发现他又在抽烟了
I found him with another fag in his mouth this morning.

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,427
噢 这样做对么
Oh, is that right?

61
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:17,362
这么说你喜欢香烟 对么
So you fancy fags, do you?

62
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,898
那好吧 给你一整条烟
Well, here. Have a whole carton of fags!

63
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:19,898
恶搞了S09E13与S10E03中Peter为了惩罚Chris而给了他一整条烟

64
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,984
我只是想得到一位清秀姑娘的垂青
I just want a comely lass to look upon me with favour.

65
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,486
我看上你了哦
I look on you with favour.

66
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:26,137
你整个人我都看上了
I look on all of you with favour.

67
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:27,706
闭嘴 英国的Meg
Shut up, British Meg.

68
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,807
(德州口音)看看Lydia啊
Look at Lydia.

69
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:31,376
真是个下贱的威奇托婊子
What a two-bit Wichita whore.

70
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:31,376
美国堪萨斯州南部城市

71
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,678
总有一天 她会死在床上
One of these days, she's gonna wake up <i>killt.</i>

72
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:35,146
啊 弑母者
Ah, matricide.

73
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:37,182
又是个你儿时的古怪念头
Yet another of your childhood whims.

74
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:37,182
恶搞了S05E08中关于Cool Whip的发音段子

75
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:38,917
不 不是的 我只是要遵循…
No, it ain't. I'm gonna follow through with...

76
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,218
等等 你为什么那样说
Wait, why'd you say it like that?

77
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:43,188
要嵌入了么 先生?
Cutaway, sir?

78
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:45,290
是的 现在是个好时机
Yes, that's good then.

79
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:48,193
朋友们 家人们 还有跑龙套的们
Friends, family, and characters random

80
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,029
为了连续地为您带来欢乐和笑声
To bring you joy and laughter in tandem

81
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:53,865
为了转移视线和让你眼花缭乱是我们的目的
To divert and dazzle is our intention

82
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:57,185
那么做好了 放轻松 然后欣赏我们的故事
So sit back, relax, and enjoy our invention.

83
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,223
啊 我喜欢夏天
Ah, I love summer.

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,268
晚上好 Billingsbury 我是Clive Crowley
Good evening, Billingsbury. I'm Clive Crowley.

85
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,804
接下来的新闻:带着一杆枪2发子弹的男人
Coming up: a man with a gun and two bullets

86
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:17,972
已经接管了曼彻斯特市
has taken over the city of Manchester.

87
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,709
但首先是我们今晚的头条新闻: 女王陛下
But first, our top story tonight: Her Majesty, the Queen,

88
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:23,011
明天将会经过我们的小镇
will be passing through our very town tomorrow.

89
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,946
详细内容 我们现场连线到
With details, we now go live

90
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:26,915
印度记者 Tricia Dasgupta
to Indian reporter, Tricia Dasgupta.

91
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:29,651
神啊 引起这里不少骚动呢
Oh, my golly, there is much commotion.

92
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,319
谢谢 Tricia 广告之后
Thank you, Tricia. After the interval,

93
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:34,189
我们将会揭晓哪12支球队今晚打成平局
find out which 12 football teams tied tonight.

94
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,124
女王要来Billingsbury?
The Queen's comin' to Billingsbury?

95
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:37,826
这太他娘的棒了
That's bloody sweet!

96
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,961
知道么 我其实是王室的亲戚
You know, I'm actually a relation of the royal family.

97
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,830
你肯定不是
You most certainly are not.

98
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:43,631
你这想法是从哪冒出来的
Where would you get that idea?

99
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,633
我妈过去常抱怨她是个温莎家的人
Me mum used to claim she was a Windsor.

100
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:45,633
温莎甲组由1917年后开始统治大不列颠

101
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,536
而且我老听我奶奶说她是怎么傍上公爵的
And I always heard my Nana talk about how she took a duke.

102
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:48,536
duke也指体积比较大的屎

103
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,138
这也一定是场艰难的婚姻啊
Must've been a difficult marriage, too,

104
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,906
因为每天下午她都会因为
'cause every afternoon she'd be belly-achin'

105
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:53,475
她那该死的公爵(巨屎)肚子疼
about her bloody duke.

106
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,610
我想你只是有个恶心的奶奶罢了
I think you just had a gross grandmother.

107
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:57,879
不 我很肯定 为了证实这一切
No, I'm quite sure of it. And to prove it,

108
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,914
我要偷来一些女王的头发
I'm gonna nick one of the Queen's hairs

109
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:01,533
在她明天到来的时候
during her visit tomorrow.

110
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,486
然后等DNA匹配时 你们就会知道我是皇亲国戚了
And when the DNA proves a match, you'll see I'm royalty.

111
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:05,954
女王吗
The Queen, eh?

112
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,156
我更喜欢用我的香肠去捣烂她该死的布丁
I'd like to mash my banger in her blood pudding.

113
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:09,257
Googity. Googity. Glop.

114
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:11,476
- 好啊 伙计们 - 噢 你好 Seamus
- Hello, lads. - Oh, hello, Seamus.

115
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,912
今天的板球比赛表现十分良好
Right fine performance at the cricket match today.

116
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,981
是的 我很高兴你们去了现场看我比赛
Aye. I was spirited to have you down there watching me.

117
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,850
啊 真是个打一场冗长且
Well, it's a brilliant day

118
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,118
莫名其妙的板球的好天气
for a long and confusing game of cricket.

119
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,153
场地上满满的都是戴头盔的人
The field is teeming with men in helmets

120
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,822
但看上去其实完全不需要带
who don't seem like they need helmets,

121
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,390
而那些没戴头盔的人
and men not in helmets

122
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,858
看上去其实更应该带
who seem like they probably should be wearing helmets.

123
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:29,828
噢 他一板就把球直接打出了体育场
Oh, he's batted it clear out of the stadium.

124
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,331
那很厉害么 我们不清楚 但我们就是这样的
Is that good? We don't know, but it's what we do!

125
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,733
耶-耶
Y-Yay!

126
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,667
呸 呸
Boo!Boo!

127
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:36,668
呸
Boo!

128
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,791
Oh my goodness, the Queen is
going to be here presently.

129
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,626
This is oh-so-exciting!

130
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:46,861
My favorite part
before the Queen arrives

131
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:49,631
is yelling "wanker"
at Prince Charles as he passes.

132
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,049
Wanker!
Wanker!

133
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:52,784
I know, I know.

134
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,085
Wanker!
Wanker!

135
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:55,953
Yes, I know. Yes.

136
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,472
Wanker!
You're a wanker!

137
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:59,390
Wanker!
Right, quite right.

138
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,009
Spot on. He's got it.

139
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:03,762
I say, a lot of people have
turned out to see the Queen.

140
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,130
Should make for a grand day.

141
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,982
Hey, watch it there!

142
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:18,193
Good show, old chap.
Well played.

143
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,327
Here she comes!

144
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:20,829
(crowd cheering)

145
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:24,816
Very well.
Time for action.

146
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:28,019
A lock of the Queen's hair
shall soon be mine.

147
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,838
Here she comes.
Have at it then.

148
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:32,891
Crikey! This is a haircut
fit for a queen!

149
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,178
Oh, bloody hell!

150
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,247
All right, time for Plan B.
Let's go!

151
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:48,490
I'm not going any lower.

152
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,441
Well, Father,
you gave it a good go.

153
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:53,344
Oh, we're not done yet.
Come on!

154
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,946
(tires squeal)

155
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:58,233
Queen! Queen! Give me
some of your hair!

156
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,318
Come on, Queen!
Don't be a bitch!

157
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:02,036
Get us away
from that lunatic!

158
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,505
(tires squeal)

159
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,798
She's heading into that tunnel!

Dear God! The Queen's dead!

(both whistling)

163
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:26,544
All right, Collingsworth,
I got a hair.

164
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,064
Now, just walk away casual-like
and we're in the clear.

165
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,683
Oh, no!
Here come the coppers!

Shame about the Queen, though.

175
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:01,963
Yeah, I reckon she's with
Jesus Christ in heaven now.

We now return

182
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:20,225
to <i>The Comedy Central Roast</i>
<i>of Robin Williams.</i>

183
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:22,411
Aw, man, Robin Williams
is my favorite!

184
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:23,845
He must be getting recognized

185
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:25,547
for all his contributions
to show business.

186
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:27,149
I don't think
that's what a roast is.

187
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:30,152
Robin, as a comic, it's an honor
to be up here roasting you.

188
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,387
As a moviegoer, I want
to punch you in the face.

189

(laughter)

190

Oh, that's funny.
Advocate violence.

191
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:37,325
And let's face it, Mork.

192
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:39,394
You're getting Nanu-Na-old!

194

Stop it! You stop it!

195
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:46,701
Robin Williams has a manic gift
that gladdens a sad world

196
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,639
and all he asks in return
is our unceasing attention!

197
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:52,540
How can you allow this?!

198
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:55,560
Robin Williams has given us
nothing but joy!

199
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:58,013
I wish everyone
was Robin Williams!

Oh, my God.
What happened?

205
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:19,134
You were in a coma, and then I
kissed you, and you woke up.

206

(mumbles)
Like two days later.

207
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:22,704
Anyway, all your
numbers are normal.

208
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:24,206
What numbers?
No idea.

209
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:27,175
Well, congratulations.
You're gonna be just fine.

Oh, my God!

212
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:31,680
You're...
You're Robin Williams!

I hope this is covered

220

00:11:27,023 --> 00:11:30,291
your torso is
so broad and solid.

294
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,395
(spits, coughs)

295
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:34,546
Ah! You're not Lois!

296
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:36,881
I can hear you!
I'm not deaf!

297
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:39,634
I don't believe that's
real sign language!

298
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:41,453
Brian, this is
a disaster!

299
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,004
I turned everyone
into Robin Williams!

300
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,622
You gotta help me!

301
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,790
Yo-yo-yo! Peter G.

302
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,992
What's happening,
dawg?

303
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,245
Oh, Sideways Hat Robin.
Dear God, no!

304
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:52,247
(kettle whistles)

305
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:56,334
♪ Gonna have some hot tea,
baby, this morning! ♪

306
00:11:56,402 --> 00:11:57,635
(yells)

307
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,554
Run, Forrest, run!
Run, Forrest, run!

308
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,172
All right, Rupert,
all we have to do

309
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,474
is act like Robin Williams,

310
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:04,442
and he'll think
we've already changed.

311
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,877
Ho-ho! Scattered
stream of references!

312
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:08,113
Lots of energy! One good one
for every ten! Ho-ho!

313
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:15,136
Damn these hands!

314
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:16,838
Mwah!

315
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:19,140
Vell, I haven't been
to temple in a while!

316
00:12:19,191 --> 00:12:20,842
Ah!

317
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,577
Ladies and gentleman,
The Doors!

318
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:24,979
(screaming)

319
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,998
Ho-ho! Jogging!
Running on empty! Ho-ho!

320
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,750
Run, Forrest, run!

321
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:31,503
ALL:
Ho-ho! Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

322
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:33,571
Ho-ho! I'm a Mercedes!

323
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,873
Und vere are your papers?

324
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,941
Are you from
East or Vest Berlin?

325
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,677
(a la John Wayne):
Vell, I'm from Vest Berlin, pilgrim.

326
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:42,414
(sobbing)

327
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,765
Shut up!

328
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,133
(yelling)

329
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:48,186
(sobbing)

330
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,671
Ho-ho! Ho-ho!
Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

331
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:52,991
Stop riffing!

332
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:57,312
Jump, Forest, jump!

333
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:58,797
Must be a leap
year, ho-ho!

334
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,455
Time to lose
some weight, dearie?

335
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:10,558
No... more... comedy.

336
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:17,832
Guys, will you please
settle down?

337
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:19,367
Can we, can we settle down,
please?

338
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:20,685
Every... everyone.

339
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:22,086
Everyone, can I have
your attention?

340
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:23,488
Oh, Captains! My Captains!

341
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:26,541
I have an announcement to make:

342
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:28,042
You are all free!

343
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,111
You have been fired
from the school.

344
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,865
Vietnam is over.
The hospital is closing.

345
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,900
Will Hunting is all better.

346
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:37,569
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

347
00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:39,704
Shut up. Seriously, shut up.

348
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,206
Please, you are done here.

349
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:44,509
Go and spread your comedy
to all corners of this country.

350
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:49,013
Wait, not you five.

351
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:52,217
I'm gonna keep you for...
an experiment.

352
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:55,253
Ho-ho! Eggs!

353
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:57,105
Who came first, the chicken
or the porn star?

354
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:58,206
Ho-ho!
<i>The Porn Identity!</i>

355
00:13:58,274 --> 00:13:59,507
Who am I? Oh, yeah!
The pizza man!

356
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:01,743
Baka-chikka-bwow-bwow!
Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

357
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,011
Peter, can you pass
the coffee?

358
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:05,713
Sure, Brian the dog.

359
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:10,635
Anything for my family.

360
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,804
Coffee now.
Here we go, here we go.

361
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:18,759
I guess Disney wouldn't let us
do the <i>Aladdin</i> one.

362
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:31,150
LOIS:
Stewie, rise and shine.

363
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,755
Good morning, Stewie.

364
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:37,023
(bleep) you.

365
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,208
You ready for the day, sweetie?

366
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:41,577
Oh, someone needs
a diaper change.

367
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,584
Are you proud
of yourself?

368
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:49,936
That this
is what you do?

369
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:52,054
Is this a dime?
Did you swallow a dime?

370
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:54,574
Yeah, wipe it off
and put it back in your purse,

371
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:55,942
you white trash hen.

372
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:57,176
There we go.

373
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,762
Who's my clean little boy?

374
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:01,280
(Stewie laughing)

375
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,734
Ugh! Your roots
are ridiculous.

376
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:05,885
I'm gonna grab
your hair 'cause

377
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:07,019
I like grabbing stuff.

378
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,455
Okay. Okay, Stewie, let go.

379
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,641
Let, let go, Stewie.
Let go of Mommy's hair.

380
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,843
When I grow up, I'm
never gonna call you.

381
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:16,112
I'm gonna be busy
with my job and my family.

382
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,847
You'll be nothing.

383
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:25,788
Stewie, I want you
to have my ring.

384
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,607
It's one of my most
important possessions,

385
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:29,475
and I want you to have it.

386
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:32,111
Okay, red flag.
Red flag, everybody!

387
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,267
Hey, Stewie,
wanna go down the slide?

388
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:39,919
STEWIE:
Um...

389
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:41,120
What's the matter?

390
00:15:41,188 --> 00:15:42,989
Ya never been down
the slide before?

391
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:44,924
(scoffs) Yeah, like,
like a thousand times.

392
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:48,160
Just done it so much
I'm bored with it, that's all.

393
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:52,632
All right, I guess
we're doing this.

394
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:57,169
Whoa.

395
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:58,921
Come on down,
Stewie!

396
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:01,207
(hawks screeching)

397
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,694
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy.

398
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:08,631
All right, you can do this,
Stewie. Here we go.

399
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:09,699
(screams)

400
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:11,584
(thud)

401
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:12,618
Are you okay?

402
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:14,086
Yeah, that wasn't so bad.

403
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:15,521
You might wanna move.

404
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,723
That farting Polish kid
is coming down the slide.

405
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,558
(Stewie grunts)
(kid farts)

406
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:20,993
Ah, Pavel!

407
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,295
Hey, kid, come here.
I wanna see

408
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:41,664
if I can still smell
your mom's boobs on your mouth.

409
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,883
Why don't you go hump
a pile of garbage?

410
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:50,423
All right, here we go.
Classic.

411
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:51,824
(engine starts)

412
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:53,426
Uh-oh. (grunts)

413
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:58,597
Oh, God! Brian! Brian!

414
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:03,185
Guess I'm going for a ride.

415
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:12,395
Why are we stopping?

416
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:13,546
(squirrel chitters)

417
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:16,231
Oh, come on.

418
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:20,886
For God's sake, Brian.
It's just a squirrel.

419
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:22,088
BRIAN:
Yeah!

420
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,205
Oh, God!

421
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:28,961
(Stewie groans)

422
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:30,930
He can't hurt you anymore.

423
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:37,036
Hey there, little fella.

424
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:39,638
We sure got a lovely day for it,
don't we?

425
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:41,507
Stay away from
my brother's butt.

426
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:46,395
Okay, Stewie, let's get
that little face washed off.

427
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,631
Then you can play
with your bath toys, huh?

428
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:50,683
No, I hate getting
my face washed!

429
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,485
Oh, look!
It's just Mr. Frog!

430
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:54,403
Hello, Mr. Frog...

431
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:55,654
(spluttering)

432
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:58,140
My God, how the hell
do I keep falling for that?

433
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,825
Now you play with your toys

434
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:02,445
and I'll go get yo
a nice, fluffy towel.

435
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:06,415
Stewart Griffin, explorer,
adventurer,

436
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,634
skin-diving
international playboy.

437
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,720
(takes deep breath)

438
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:15,124
(Stewie growls, screams)

439
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:17,009
I'm swimming at night
'cause I'm a slut

440
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:19,345
and now I'm paying
the price for it.

441
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:21,797
(panting)

442
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:23,599
Hey, Stewie!

443
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,135
Wow, looks like you got
some cool bath toys in there.

444
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:27,937
Is it okay if I join ya?

445
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,605
No! (screams)

446
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,143
Hey, is that
my froggie butt cloth?

447
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,732
Okay, Stewie, bedtime's
in ten minutes.

448
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,066
I'll be right back.

449
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:44,120
Hmm. I think I have time
for a quickie.

450
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:55,347
Excuse me, Mr. Cobain.

451
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:56,515
Look, I know
you're depressed.

452
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,784
Made some bad choices
with women,

453
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:00,069
but there's another way.

454
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:02,655
Haagen-Dazs,
lots of Haagen-Dazs.

455
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:07,059
(whooshing)

456
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:08,611
Well, let's see if it worked.

457
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:10,146
Here we go.

458
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:12,865
Ha! You're still alive,
you fat (bleep).

459
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,117
Okay, Stewie, time for bed.

460
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:17,203
You want Mommy to read you
a night-night story?

461
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,171
Oh, how 'bout this one?

462
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:23,125
<i>"Good Night, Town</i>
<i>from</i> Footloose"?

463
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:25,561
LOIS:

464
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:31,300
Who is this book for?

465
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:41,477
(slurring): Hey, Lois.
I'm home from the Clam.

466
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:43,229
You know what that means.

467
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:46,198
STEWIE: You spent the last ten minutes
parked in front of the house

468
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:47,750
crying in your car?

469
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:50,352
Not now, Peter. I'm doing
story time with Stewie.

470
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,620
Yeah, scram, Drinky.

471
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:52,988
I got a story.

472
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:55,491
It's about the little penis
that could.

473
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,593
It thinks it can, it thinks...

474
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:59,361
In fact, it's pretty sure
it can.

475
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:00,830
It-It, it's gonna.

476
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,364
Hey, am I gonna have
to handle this?

477
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:03,883
Do you want me
to handle this?

478
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,884
Peter, just go wait
in the bedroom.

479
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:06,502
I'll be right there.

480
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:10,339
Fine, but if I gotta pee first,
this night's gonna be ruined.

481
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:11,624
Ruined.

482
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:17,429
Good night, sweetie.
Mommy loves you.

483
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:24,420
(Stewie yawns)

484
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:26,055
(rhythmic thudding)

485
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:27,590
Huh?

486
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:32,177
(both grunting)

487
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,514
It's big, isn't it?

488
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,550
Yes, Peter.
It's very big.

489
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:41,237
Yeah, it's big.

490
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:43,622
Oh, God, yes!

491
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,624
Ah, yes...

492
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,810
Ah, yeah.

493
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:55,176
Oh, you're gonna use that thing,
good. I love you so much.

494
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:59,276
