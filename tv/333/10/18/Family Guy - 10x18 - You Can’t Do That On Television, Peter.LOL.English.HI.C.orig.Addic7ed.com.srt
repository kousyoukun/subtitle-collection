ANNOUNCER: Need to move?

13
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:38,056
No problem.

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,958
Take it yourself with U-Haul.

15
00:00:40,026 --> 00:00:41,559
But I've never driven
a truck before.

16
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:42,861
ANNOUNCER: <i>No problem.</i>

17
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:45,213
<i>U-Haul lets anyone drive</i>
<i>a giant truck,</i>

18
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:48,650
<i>even though it's dangerous,</i>
<i>because, hey, you're moving.</i>

19
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:51,653
(horns honking,
tires screeching)

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,240
Sorry, I'm making a go
of it in a new city.

21
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:57,442
All right, I'll see you
guys in a couple of days.

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,743
Where are you going?

23
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:00,312
I'm off to take pictures
of lesbian butts.

24
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,796
What?

25
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:03,915
Joe and Quagmire and I are
making a coffee table book

26
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:05,950
called <i>Lesbian Butts</i>
<i>in '80s Jeans.</i>

27
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:08,320
I already got the first
chapter right here.

28
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:10,388
Where'd you take
all these pictures?

29
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:12,540
You know, coffee houses,
Chevy dealerships,

30
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:13,925
all the usual places.

31
00:01:13,993 --> 00:01:14,926
Peter, you're not
doing that.

32
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:16,461
I got a ton
of errands to run,

33
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:18,096
and I need your help
around here.

34
00:01:18,164 --> 00:01:19,731
Well, fine, if I
can't do the book

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,266
I'm gonna hurt
something you love.

36
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:26,271
(grunting)

37
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:27,555
(coughing)

38
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:29,040
You happy now?

39
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:31,159
Maybe we should discuss this
in the other room.

40
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:32,761
I don't like fighting
in front of the kids.

41
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:34,562
No, I want to fight
in front of the kids.

44
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:39,317
and help
around the house.

45
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:41,419
Now, I need you to watch
Stewie till I get back.

46
00:01:43,422 --> 00:01:45,623
Whoever did this, thank you.

47
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:51,346
All right, Stewie,
since Lois says

48
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:52,580
I got to keep
an eye on you,

49
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:54,849
we might as well have
some father-son time,

50
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:56,067
so I'm gonna measure
your penis

51
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:57,736
and then I'm gonna
measure my penis,

52
00:01:57,803 --> 00:01:59,404
and we're gonna see
whose is bigger.

53
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:00,572
Doesn't really
seem fair.

54
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,524
All right, let's see
what you got.

55
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:04,976
Stupid game anyway.

56
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:06,644
ANNOUNCER:
Hey, kids, coming up next,

57
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:08,947
it's the <i>Jolly Farm Revue</i>
marathon.

58
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:10,098
No, no, don't
switch it.

59
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:10,965
I want to watch
<i>Jolly Farm.</i>

60
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:12,434
Son of a bitch.

61
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,969
I got to spend the rest of the
day watching stupid kid shows.

62
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:16,654
I'd rather watch paint dry.

63
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:19,708
(sexy music playing)

64
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,000
Nice.

65
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:34,239
Wakey, wakey.

66
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,241
ALL:
Good morning, Mother Maggie.

67
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:37,642
Heh, who's this?

68
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,777
I like this lady.

69
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,078
Hey, do you think
Mother Maggie

70
00:02:40,146 --> 00:02:41,346
is married to
Father Fa...?

71
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:42,830
Oh, probably not.

72
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,182
MOTHER MAGGIE:
And the unicorn slid

73
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:47,035
down the rainbow
to a field of jellybeans

74
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:49,204
where she
and the other villagers decided

75
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:52,107
it had been the best day ever.

76
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:54,125
Oh, look, it's Pengrove Pig,

77
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:56,661
and he's sharing
his apples nicely, isn't he?

78
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,947
Like a champ he is.

79
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:03,368
♪ Head, shoulders, knees,
and toes, knees and toes. ♪

80
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:06,805
And that's how you make a duck
out of an oatmeal container.

81
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:09,808
This is the greatest show
in the history of television.

82
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,777
Mother Maggie, you are
a kindred spirit.

83
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:14,779
This must be how twins
who are separated at birth

84
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:16,548
feel when they first meet.

85
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,971
Trade house keys,
bang each other's wives?

86
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,873
Yep.

87
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:32,180
I can't dissect
this pig, Mr. Kingman.

88
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:33,648
It's against
my religion.

89
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:34,949
Believe me, Neil,
it's no thrill

90
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,618
for the pig to
touch a Jew either.

91
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:38,419
Okay, how about you,
Meg, how are you doing?

92
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:39,954
Pretty good.

93
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:42,891
It's, it's kind of cool
cutting something that's not me.

94
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,926
Wow, that's some
very impressive work.

95
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:47,862
It's easy for Meg to dissect
a pig because she is a pig.

96
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,930
(laughs)

97
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:50,348
Hey!

98
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,983
All right,
I'll let that one slide.

99
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:53,718
Meg, you have some
real potential.

100
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:55,286
Have you ever thought
about becoming a doctor

101
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:56,488
when you grow up?

102
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:58,756
I always just assumed
I'd work on the docks.

103
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,158
Don't limit
yourself, Meg.

104
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:01,926
Doctors wear a mask
most of the time,

105
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:03,728
so this isn't
an issue.

106
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:05,513
If you're interested
the school has a program

107
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:07,081
where you can shadow
a real doctor

108
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,850
and learn more about
the medical field.

109
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:11,035
Yeah, wow, I'd love
to check that out.

110
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,287
Great, I'll
set it up.

111
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:13,972
I didn't know a pig
could be a doctor.

112
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,073
Hey!

113
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,141
You get
just a few more of those.

114
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:22,185
MOTHER MAGGIE:
Now, children, we're going

115
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,697
to learn who wears a hat.

116
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:25,650
Can a fireman wear
a hat?

117
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:27,285
KIDS: Yes.
No? Yes.

118
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:29,254
Can a policeman
wear a hat?

119
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,188
KIDS: Yes.
No way.

120
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:31,339
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

121
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:32,740
Yes, he can, I knew that.

122
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:36,044
Now, you at home, tell me,
who else wears a hat?

123
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:37,779
A very formal horse?

124
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,280
Very good.

125
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:43,418
Even a bowling ball can wear a
hat if you use your imagination.

126
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:46,454
(laughing):
A bowling ball wearing a hat?

127
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:48,957
This is what high-def
was invented for.

128
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:51,125
Peter, what the hell
are you doing?

129
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:52,727
Being a good dad
like you asked.

130
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,295
I've been watching
<i>Jolly Farm</i> with Stewie

131
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:55,563
for the last
three hours.

132
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,266
That's not Stewie,
that's a pineapple.

133
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,335
Oh, my God, where is Stewie?

134
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:01,603
I don't know, but
I'm sure he's fine.

135
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,604
Peter, he's a baby.

136
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:04,239
You can't leave him alone.

137
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,157
Come on, it's good to
have some alone time.

138
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:08,393
You know, I spent a year
alone on a desert island

139
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,361
with nothing but a monkey
to keep me company.

140
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:12,964
You're saved, sir, we're going
to get you back to civilization.

141
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,766
And how about we bring along
your monkey pal?

142
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,984
Okay.

143
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:17,435
Yeah, we can teach
him sign language

144
00:05:17,503 --> 00:05:18,803
and he can
tell us stories

145
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:20,638
about what you two did
on the island together.

146
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:23,258
No, n-no, no, no, let's, let's
not, let's not bring the monkey.

147
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,793
Um, I have a peanut M&M
up my nose

148
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:28,563
and it's now further up
than my finger can reach.

149
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,665
I am ready to farm
this out to someone.

150
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,634
Oh, Stewie, there you are.

151
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:35,386
Peter, I asked you to do one
simple thing-- watch the baby--

152
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:36,988
and you couldn't even do that.

153
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:38,556
Come on, Stewie.

154
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:40,558
Geez, why's she got
to be such a nag?

155
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:42,560
I wish she was more
like Mother Maggie.

156
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:45,530
Mother Maggie has an
announcement, lads and lasses.

157
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:47,966
I've had such fun playing
and learning with you

158
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,735
these last few years, but now,

159
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:55,039
just as bees must leave the
hive, I must leave Jolly Farm--

160
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:57,609
not that you asked, but to have
fertility treatments--

161
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:01,312
so this will be our last episode
of <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

162
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,580
What? No.

163
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:04,482
They can't cancel <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

164
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,200
Peter, it's just a
stupid kids' show.

165
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:08,002
Just a stupid
kids' show?

166
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:10,638
What about Pengrove Pig
and the Lollipop Luau?

167
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:12,073
I-I-I don't know.

168
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,408
This is going
to leave a void,

169
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:15,059
and somebody's got
to fill it.

170
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:16,194
I think you're
overreacting.

171
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:17,595
You don't understand,
Brian.

172
00:06:17,663 --> 00:06:19,647
What am I supposed to do
without <i>Jolly Farm?</i>

173
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:22,583
I'll be like an Italian mom
without bad kids.

174
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:26,220
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell
is all the commotion in here?

175
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,372
We're not doing anything.

176
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,806
You getting
fresh with me?

177
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:30,875
I'm tired of bailing both
of youse out of prison.

178
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:32,076
We're both
in college

179
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:33,711
and we consistently make
the dean's list.

180
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,013
I'm telling
your father.

181
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,114
Good.

182
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:41,686
Where the hell
is our food?

183
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:43,187
Yeah, where are
Mom and Dad?

184
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:44,889
And where's
that awesome finger painting

185
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:45,857
Stewie did this morning?

186
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:46,891
Oh, here it is.

187
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,992
Thank you for bringing it up.

188
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,360
I wasn't going to bring it up.

189
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:51,129
Well, what's
going on?

190
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,030
You haven't
eaten yet?

191
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:53,031
No.

192
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,332
Where's your father?

193
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,200
He was supposed to put
the lasagna in the oven.

194
00:06:56,268 --> 00:06:58,903
I ask him to do one thing
while I'm at yoga.

195
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,605
You go to an intro class

196
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:02,173
and it's not even
at the yoga studio.

197
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,391
It's in someone's living room.

198
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,926
And that's not even a yoga mat.

199
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:07,095
That's the old pee pad
from my crib.

200
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,697
Uh, Lois, you might want
to check this out.

201
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:12,316
What is it, Brian?
Take a look.

202
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:17,238
PETER: And now, boys and girls,
it's time for <i>Petey's Funhouse.</i>

203
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:20,408
(children cheering)

204
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:23,411
♪ It's gonna be fun
and we'll have lots of yuks ♪

205
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:25,980
♪ And maybe learn some stuff
but not definitely ♪

206
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:29,300
♪ It's the <i>Petey's Funhouse</i>
show. ♪

207
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:31,936
Ugh, another
Aaron Sorkin show

208
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:33,938
that's way over
everyone's head.

209
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:42,688
How the hell did you even get
a TV show, Peter?

210
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:44,356
I just answered an
ad off Craigslist,

211
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:47,292
and after several hours of
sexual torture, I had a show.

212
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,293
(phone rings)

213
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:49,428
Don't answer that.

214
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:51,096
I gave out that
number under duress.

215
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:53,398
Lois, Peter's show is on the
local public access channel.

216
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:54,900
Anyone can have one.

217
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,702
Yeah, <i>Petey's Funhouse</i>
is actually replacing

218
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,904
<i>The Bad Audio Basement Show.</i>

219
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:02,541
(distorted): And once the hot glue dries,
your birdhouse will be complete.

220
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,576
Peter, you already do
nothing around the house

221
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:07,012
and now you're wasting
more time with this nonsense.

222
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,281
Geez, you're still getting
on my hump about this?

223
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:10,482
I help out
around here.

224
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,217
Just this morning I
changed Meg's diaper

225
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,652
and I sent her
off to school.

226
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,221
Boy, can she kick, but
she left here spotless.

227
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,511
Dr. Hartman, thanks for
letting me shadow you.

228
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,680
I just know I'm going
to learn so much.

229
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:27,049
It's my pleasure, Meg,
and you're in good hands.

230
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:28,450
You see that diploma?

231
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:29,952
Yale Medical School.

232
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:31,820
Wow, that's
impressive.

233
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:34,389
Thank you, I work very hard
on my calligraphy.

234
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:36,992
So, how about we take a little
stroll around the hospital?

235
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:39,110
This area is known
as a hallway.

236
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:40,462
Don't worry,
you'll pick up

237
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,948
on all the technical
doctor jargon pretty soon.

238
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:45,884
Hey, is it prescription
or perscription?

239
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,336
I think
it's prescription.

240
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,339
Prescription... that just
feels weird in my mouth.

241
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:53,058
Perscription is better.

242
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,626
Oh, and there's the E.R.

243
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:57,179
Don't go in there unless you
want everyone to yell at you.

244
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:06,138
Hi, kids, I'm Petey Griffin.

245
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:07,739
ALL: Hi, Petey!

246
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:10,325
We're going to have so much fun
on <i>Petey's Funhouse</i> today,

247
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:14,263
but before we begin, your friend
Petey wants to sing you a song.

248
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:18,016
♪ What makes you
so special? ♪

249
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:20,802
♪ The fact
that you are special ♪

250
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,155
♪ But if everybody's
special ♪

251
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:25,874
♪ That kinda
waters it down ♪

252
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,527
♪ So some of you
ain't special ♪

253
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:31,280
♪ I can tell you
who is special ♪

254
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:33,498
♪ Like you and you
ain't special. ♪

255
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,300
And you are
and you're not.

256
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:41,306
Okay, kids, it's story time here
on <i>Petey's Funhouse.</i>

257
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:44,810
Today's story is
<i>Lesbian Butts in '80s Jeans.</i>

258
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,845
Ooh, that's a classic.

259
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:50,449
Once upon a time, some chick in
a leather jacket in front of me

260
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:52,751
in the parking lot walked
into Home Depot,

261
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:55,454
and her butt looked like this.

262
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,055
Everybody see this?

263
00:09:57,123 --> 00:09:59,324
Everybody see
how shapeless this is?

264
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:02,828
She walked out of there with
a bag of soil on each shoulder.

265
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,496
Now, before I show you
this next one,

266
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:07,883
has anyone here ever heard
of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally?

267
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:12,654
I know we have a lot of yuks
here on <i>Petey's Funhouse,</i>

268
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:15,324
but one thing
that's not fun is a bully.

269
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:17,926
Now, how many of you kids out
there have ever gotten bullied?

270
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,162
Aw, come on up here

271
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:22,331
and tell us
about it, champ.

272
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:27,302
Well, my name is Winston,
and I'm quite fond of ballet.

273
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,471
One time I tried out
for Little League

274
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:31,974
in my ballet shoes,
and the other kids made

275
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,443
so much fun of me,
I wet my pants.

276
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,078
What, wait,
what, like pee?

277
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:37,546
How old were you?
Eight.

278
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:38,780
Aah, too old!

279
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:41,116
Too old to be peeing yourself,
Baby Pee Pants.

280
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:42,918
All right,
you kids finish him off.

281
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:48,757
Hey, what do you
got there?

282
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,392
Oh, I'm just playing
with some Lee Logs.

283
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,860
What the hell
are Lee Logs?

284
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:53,528
A little something I
created-- Lee Logs.

285
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:54,896
Robert E. Lee.

286
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:56,832
You know, you got Lincoln
Logs, you got Lee Logs.

287
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,767
I don't get it, can,
can you build a house?

288
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:00,102
You can build
quarters.

289
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,570
And people live there?

290
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:03,572
They live there if you
tell 'em to live there.

291
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,474
I don't know if I like
the idea of Lee Logs.

292
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,142
Yeah, they're not
selling very well.

293
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,910
Peter, dinner!

294
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:10,162
No dinner for
me tonight, Lois.

295
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,431
I have to go work on
a bit for tomorrow's show.

296
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,666
If I can kill 25
butterflies in a minute,

297
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,768
I won't have to show
the audience my balls.

298
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:18,870
Peter, this is the
fourth night in a row

299
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:21,039
you've skipped out on us
to work on your show.

300
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:23,275
Once again, I'm gonna be stuck
cleaning up the kitchen,

301
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:25,811
helping out with homework,
and bathing Stewie.

302
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:27,679
You know, I'd lay off
the nagging if I was you.

303
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:29,047
I'm a children's TV star now.

304
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:30,816
I can have any three-year-old
girl I want.

305
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,384
Just know that, Lois.

306
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:34,519
Peter, I'm only asking
you to do your share.

307
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:35,687
Well, it's getting
on my nerves.

308
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:36,822
Like, right now,

309
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,090
you are the most
annoying thing

310
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:40,692
in my life, with the
possible exception of Evite.

311
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,561
What's this?
It's this Web site you can use

312
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:43,829
to invite people
to stuff.

313
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:45,814
Does it have to be
a significant event?

314
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:47,299
No. Not at all!

315
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,767
Well, do you just
get the invitation,

316
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:50,168
and that's the end of it?

317
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:52,120
No, it'll remind you
about it constantly!

318
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:54,523
Is there any way
I can customize this

319
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,359
to showcase my personality
through familiar clip art?

320
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:58,727
Yes!

321
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:00,278
And what about
those replying?

322
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:02,164
Can they demonstrate
their sense of humor

323
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:03,565
through hilarious replies?

324
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,034
Yes, yes, yes to
everything you're saying!

325
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:08,470
I'm so excited
to get started!

326
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:10,706
You do that while
I jump out this window!

327
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,507
(glass shatters)

328
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:15,377
ANNOUNCER: <i>Evite. Tell a friend</i>
<i>and then kill yourself.</i>

329
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,315
And then when you
get a little older,

330
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:21,950
stuff will come out.

331
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:23,752
(old-timey car horn honks)

332
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,220
Uh-oh!

333
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:28,073
Sounds like my cranky
new neighbor just got home.

334
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:29,741
I hope she doesn't
come over here

335
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,176
and give me the business.

336
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:32,294
(knocking)

337
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:33,478
Peter!

338
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,747
Oh, hi, Saggy Naggy.

339
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,432
Never mind with "hi!"

340
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,635
It sounds like someone's
having fun over here!

341
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:42,671
You know I don't
like that!

342
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:45,006
Hey, kids.
Meet Saggy Naggy.

343
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:47,142
Real nice lady, huh?

344
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,710
AUDIENCE: No!

345
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,345
What can I do for you,
Saggy Naggy?

346
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:52,030
You can stop having fun!

347
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:54,783
But we like fun,
don't we, kids?

348
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:56,068
AUDIENCE: Yes!

349
00:12:56,135 --> 00:12:57,402
Well, too bad,

350
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,937
'cause you're all gonna
eat your vegetables,

351
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:01,223
listen to long stories
about my cousins,

352
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,442
and help me
fold sheets!

353
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:05,677
And you! You're gonna
help around the house,

354
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:06,845
take out the garbage,

355
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:08,997
and give Stewie
his bottle!

356
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:10,732
Yeah, I heard it.
They say my name

357
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,968
on TV all the time;
calm down, bitch.

358
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:14,803
Make me dinner,
and go rent <i>Twilight,</i>

359
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:16,688
and do mouth
stuff on me,

360
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:19,057
even though it's been a
day-and-a-half since I've showered,

361
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,793
and I've used several public
bathrooms in the interim!

362
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,229
Sounds like this could
go on for a while, kids.

363
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:25,380
Hey, Saggy Naggy,

364
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:27,282
I know what'll cheer you up.

365
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,650
Do you like pie?

366
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:30,068
I guess.

367
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,987
Well, how does this taste?

368
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:35,040
(audience cheers)

369
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:36,491
Well, I guess she thought

370
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,794
it was a no-pies-in-the-face
kind of neighborhood.

371
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:42,497
Wrong assessment
of the neighborhood, sweetheart!

372
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:47,702
And how are you today, Mr...

373
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,937
Pa-ti-ent?

374
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:50,539
My last name is Saunders.

375
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:52,524
That's an interesting
pronunciation.

376
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,292
This is Meg; she's
shadowing me today.

377
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,428
And boy, could she put
the applesauce away

378
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:58,313
in the commissary.
Hi.

379
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:00,265
Little tip, Meg:
The inside of this folder

380
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,167
has a diagram
of the human body.

381
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:03,502
Kind of a cheat sheet.

382
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:07,489
Now see, right now,
I'm listening for cancer.

383
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:09,774
Do you mean
his heartbeat?

384
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:11,827
Maybe. Here,
you take a turn.

385
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:15,447
Wow, your heartbeat
sounds a little fast.

386
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,682
Do you smoke?
Actually, I do.

387
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,484
Ah, me, too.
Isn't it great?

388
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:20,886
Well, that's
bad for you.

389
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:21,987
You shouldn't do it.

390
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:23,321
It raises your heart rate

391
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,157
and can lead
to emphysema or cancer.

392
00:14:25,224 --> 00:14:27,108
That's impressive, Meg.
It's no big deal.

393
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:29,110
It's just stuff
I learned in health class.

394
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:30,812
Well, you're clearly
a bright, young lady.

395
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,514
And you've got quite a...

396
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,566
head on your...

397
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:35,767
shoulders.

398
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,068
Thanks.

399
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:39,504
Dr. Hartman, you just got
this urgent message.

400
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:40,989
Oh, dear.
Prilosec, huh?

401
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:42,257
No, it's below that.

402
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:43,491
Oh.

403
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,626
Oh, my God.

404
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:45,844
Meg, I'm afraid
my brother

405
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,212
just tried to kill
himself in prison.

406
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,747
I-I have to go.

407
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:50,782
You're gonna have to take
things from here, I guess.

408
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,184
What?! What are you
talking about?

409
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,402
Well, you now know
about as much as I do

410
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,653
about this whole
doctor thing.

411
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:57,205
But I have no formal
medical training.

412
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:59,274
Ah, you'll be fine.
I think that book on the shelf

413
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:01,009
has most of the
stuff in there.

414
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:03,678
And don't forget the cheat sheet
if you need a helping...

415
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,664
hand.

416
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:11,403
Are we really
buying fish

417
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,805
at the same place
we buy tires?

418
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:16,107
And, w-what... "Fazio"?

419
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:18,510
What, is that a brand
of Blu-ray player?

420
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:20,929
Stewie, this sweatshirt
is so sophisticated.

421
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:22,998
Look, it says New York.

422
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:24,966
People will think
I'm from there.

423
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:26,201
(children laughing)

424
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,355
Put your phone away;
we're at a funeral!

425
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:31,957
Oh, my God.

426
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:33,391
(laughs)
Look!

427
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,126
It's Saggy Naggy.

428
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:36,111
GROUP:
Boo!

429
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:37,312
You're mean.

430
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,847
I don't like you,
Saggy Naggy.

431
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:40,832
You stink, Saggy Naggy.

432
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,567
My goodness, that's
a very rude thing

433
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:43,802
to say to someone.

434
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:45,370
Calling them Saggy...

435
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:46,755
(all laugh)

436
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,156
What the hell?!

437
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,141
Young man, what do
you think you're...

438
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,660
Lois, I just saw
Jessica Alba on television.

439
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:07,078
We've got 90 seconds;
let's go!

440
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,279
Peter, I'm not
in the mood!

441
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,781
That's okay. We can
do it anyway.

442
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:12,050
Peter, I was assaulted
in public because of you!

443
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:13,801
Oh, my God, what happened?!

444
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:14,969
I'll tell you
what happened.

445
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:17,138
A group of kids
attacked me at Costmart

446
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,073
because you portrayed
me on your show

447
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:20,808
as a raging
puppet bitch!

448
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,176
Writers take
from their lives.

449
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:24,379
You married a creative type.
You knew this was a risk.

450
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:26,080
What's that
supposed to mean?

451
00:16:26,148 --> 00:16:28,650
Well, the last few weeks, you've
been nagging the hell out of me.

452
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,251
Peter, you think
I like nagging you?

453
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:32,553
One of us needs to be
an adult in this marriage,

454
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:33,988
and it's clearly not you.

455
00:16:34,056 --> 00:16:36,291
Is this about me wetting
the bed just now?

456
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:37,592
Peter, don't
you understand

457
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,527
that I'm just looking
out for this family?

458
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:40,695
Besides, without
my nagging,

459
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:42,630
you'd probably
get yourself killed.

460
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:45,233
Or laid. Right,
frat house?

461
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:47,635
Yeah!
(cheering and whooping)

462
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,538
(laughs) Those knuckleheads
should be studying.

463
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:52,573
Okay, you know what?
Fine, Peter, that's it.

464
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:54,242
From now on, I'm not
nagging you anymore.

465
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,310
You're not?

466
00:16:55,377 --> 00:16:57,011
No, you're on your own.

467
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,731
I'm done with it.
I'm done with all of it!

468
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:02,166
Well, great, I should
probably get some sleep.

469
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:04,369
Tomorrow on Petey's Funhouse,
we're doing who's on first.

470
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:05,670
I'm gonna play
Costello,

471
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:08,306
and Abbott is gonna
be played by live puma.

472
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,908
Peter, that sounds
really d...

473
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,744
you know what?
Sounds great.

474
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:14,012
Have fun.

475
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,798
Thanks, Lois.
Good night.

476
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:19,934
Lois? Other families
fight, too, right?

477
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,536
Not this much.

478
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,271
Do you think maybe
we should think about

479
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,806
getting a...
It is what it is.

480
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:26,841
Let's just get Stewie to
college and go from there.

481
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,713
Sir, if you're gonna
want me to examine

482
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,147
where you're
having an issue,

483
00:17:33,215 --> 00:17:35,616
you're gonna have to be more
specific than "thingee".

484
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:38,019
Okay. It's not
the front thingee.

485
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:39,804
What's going on in here?

486
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:41,306
Where's Dr. Hartman?

487
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,841
He had a family emergency.
I'm not really a doctor

488
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,643
but I've been sort of
filling in for him.

489
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:46,911
You what?!

490
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:49,314
Well, I think I want
to go into medicine,

491
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:50,815
so I was shadowing
Dr. Hartman.

492
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:52,517
I've actually
been learning a lot,

493
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:54,319
but then he just left me here!

494
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:55,753
Well, you don't belong here!

495
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:57,855
This is a professional
medical institution

496
00:17:57,923 --> 00:18:00,124
with standards
and regulations to adhere to!

497
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:01,192
But, but I...

498
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,994
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

499
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:05,129
I'm sorry.
I'll go.

500
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:08,633
(bottle clinks)

501
00:18:10,235 --> 00:18:12,603
My issue has
resolved itself.

502
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,642
PETER:
And don't go anywhere, kids,

503
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,677
'cause coming up,
we got some classic comedy

504
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,279
with me and a puma.

505
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,214
Is Dad really gonna do this?

506
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:25,350
I told your father I was
gonna leave him alone.

507
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,518
Saggy Naggy is
keeping out of this.

508
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:28,920
Is the puma ready?

509
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:30,588
Maybe we should
poke him with the

510
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:33,157
"is-the-Puma-ready?"
stick.

511
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:36,010
(roars loudly)

512
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:38,146
Oh, my god, I can't
let him do this!

513
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:40,748
Come on, kids! We got to get
down to that TV studio!

514
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,400
Okay, yeah, just step
on the coloring book.

515
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:43,334
That's cool.

516
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:45,803
(brakes screech)

517
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:51,075
I'm asking you
who's on first?

518
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:53,745
(screaming)

519
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:54,779
(audience screams)

520
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,531
Oh, my God! Peter!

521
00:18:56,598 --> 00:18:57,882
Cut the camera! Cut it!

522
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,884
Roll a
"Petey Learn-A-Long Song"!

523
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:00,918
(screams)

524
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:02,387
(screams continue)

525
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:03,738
(to tune
of "The Farmer in the Dell")

526
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:05,406
PETER: ♪ Kentucky is a state ♪

527
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:07,708
♪ Kentucky is a state ♪

528
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:09,977
♪ All the people there
are dicks ♪

529
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:12,880
♪ Kentucky is a state. ♪

530
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:14,699
Oh, he's hurt bad.
Someone call 911!

531
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:15,900
He's bleeding too much!

532
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:17,435
He needs attention now!

533
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,771
Somebody help him!
Do something!

534
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:21,672
Now she's nagging everyone.

535
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,508
Does anyone have
any medical training?!

536
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:25,376
It looks like his
jugular is severed.

537
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,145
I learned this
at the hospital.

538
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:29,347
Mr. Swanson, find me
a first-aid kit!

539
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,282
Mom, hand me those towels.

540
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,352
Did I hold on to the ball?

541
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Hang in there, Dad.

542
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:36,854
I'm gonna get you fixed up.

543
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:46,981
You can do it, Meg.

544
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,667
Come on, Meg.
You've got to save him!

545
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:52,720
(quietly):
Peter, you need to let go.

546
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:06,384
L-Lois?

547
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:07,752
Oh, Peter, thank God!

548
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,086
You're okay.

549
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:11,422
I guess you were right
about that puma.

550
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,057
I don't know what
I was thinking.

551
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,559
I should've
listened to you.

552
00:20:14,626 --> 00:20:16,561
Peter, I don't
care about that.

553
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:19,280
I acted like a real jerk,
and I'm sorry, Lois.

554
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,149
I know you just
get on my case

555
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:22,650
'cause you're
looking out for me.

556
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:23,885
I am, Peter.

557
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:25,586
And it's only because
I love you

558
00:20:25,654 --> 00:20:27,989
and I want the best for you
and our family.

559
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:29,724
I love you, too, Lois.

560
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,828
Isn't anybody
gonna thank me?

561
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:36,130
Yeah, I'll have a water
if you're getting one.

562
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:38,416
Mr. Griffin,
you have a visitor.

563
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:39,634
Hey.

564
00:20:39,701 --> 00:20:41,135
Hey. I get it now.

565
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:42,970
"Who" is the man's <i>name.</i>

566
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:45,373
Aha, ah!
