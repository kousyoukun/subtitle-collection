# It seems today
that all you see #

00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,122
# Is violence in movies
and sex on TV #

3
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:11,592
# But where are those
good old-fashioned values #

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,579
# On which we used to rely? #

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,166
# Lucky there's a family guy #

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,386
# Lucky there's a man
who positively can do #

7
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:22,987
# All the things that make us #

8
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:24,405
# Laugh and cry #

12
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:36,484
Need to move?

13
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:37,762
No problem.

14
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:39,664
Take it yourself with U-Haul.

15
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:41,265
But I've never driven
a truck before.

16
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,567
<i>No problem.</i>

17
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,919
<i>U-Haul lets anyone drive
a giant truck,</i>

18
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:48,356
<i>even though it's dangerous,
because, hey, you're moving.</i>

19
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,946
Sorry, I'm making a go
of it in a new city.

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,148
All right, I'll see you
guys in a couple of days.

21
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:58,449
Where are you going?

22
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,502
- I'm off to take pictures
of lesbian butts. - What?

23
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,621
Joe and Quagmire and I are
making a coffee table book

24
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,656
called Lesbian Butts
in '80s Jeans.

25
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:08,026
I already got the first
chapter right here.

26
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:10,094
Where'd you take
all these pictures?

27
00:01:10,162 --> 00:01:12,246
You know, coffee houses,
Chevy dealerships,

28
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:13,631
all the usual places.

29
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,632
Peter, you're not
doing that.

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,167
I got a ton
of errands to run,

31
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:17,802
and I need your help
around here.

32
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,437
Well, fine, if I
can't do the book

33
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:20,972
I'm gonna hurt
something you love.

34
00:01:27,312 --> 00:01:28,746
You happy now?

35
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:30,865
Maybe we should discuss this
in the other room.

36
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:32,467
I don't like fighting
in front of the kids.

37
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,268
No, I want to fight
in front of the kids.

38
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:36,154
I feed off the excitement
of an audience.

39
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,755
Peter, for once
you're going to stay here

40
00:01:37,823 --> 00:01:39,023
and help
around the house.

41
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,125
Now, I need you to watch
Stewie till I get back.

42
00:01:43,128 --> 00:01:45,329
Whoever did this, thank you.

43
00:01:50,018 --> 00:01:52,282
All right, Stewie, since Lois says
I got to keep an eye on you,

44
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:54,555
we might as well have
some father-son time,

45
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:55,773
so I'm gonna measure
your penis

46
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:57,442
and then I'm gonna
measure my penis,

47
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,110
and we're gonna see
whose is bigger.

48
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:00,278
Doesn't really seem fair.

49
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:02,230
All right, let's see
what you got.

50
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:04,682
Stupid game anyway.

51
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,350
<i>Hey, kids, coming up next,</i>

52
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,653
<i>it's the Jolly Farm Revue
marathon.</i>

53
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,804
No, no, don't switch it.

54
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:10,671
I want to watch Jolly Farm.

55
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,140
Son of a bitch.

56
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:14,675
I got to spend the rest of the
day watching stupid kid shows.

57
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,360
I'd rather watch paint dry.

58
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:28,706
Nice.

59
00:02:32,244 --> 00:02:33,945
Wakey, wakey.

60
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,947
Good morning, Mother Maggie.

61
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,348
Heh, who's this?

62
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,483
I like this lady.

63
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,784
Hey, do you think
Mother Maggie

64
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:41,052
is married to
Father Fa...?

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,536
Oh, probably not.

66
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:43,888
And the unicorn slid

67
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:46,741
down the rainbow
to a field of jellybeans

68
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:48,910
where she
and the other villagers decided

69
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:51,813
it had been the best day ever.

70
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,831
Oh, look, it's Pengrove Pig,

71
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:56,367
and he's sharing
his apples nicely, isn't he?

72
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,653
Like a champ he is.

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,074
# Head, shoulders, knees,
and toes, knees and toes. #

74
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:06,511
And that's how you make a duck
out of an oatmeal container.

75
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:09,514
This is the greatest show
in the history of television.

76
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,483
Mother Maggie, you are
a kindred spirit.

77
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,485
This must be how twins
who are separated at birth

78
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:16,254
feel when they first meet.

79
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:22,677
Trade house keys,
bang each other's wives?

80
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,579
Yep.

81
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:31,886
I can't dissect
this pig, Mr. Kingman.

82
00:03:31,954 --> 00:03:33,354
It's against my religion.

83
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,655
Believe me, Neil,
it's no thrill

84
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:36,324
for the pig to
touch a Jew either.

85
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:38,625
Okay, how about you,
Meg, how are you doing?

86
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:39,660
Pretty good.

87
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:42,597
It's, it's kind of cool
cutting something that's not me.

88
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,632
Wow, that's some
very impressive work.

89
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,568
It's easy for Meg to dissect
a pig because she is a pig.

90
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:50,054
Hey!

91
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:51,689
All right,
I'll let that one slide.

92
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:53,424
Meg, you have some
real potential.

93
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:54,992
Have you ever thought
about becoming a doctor

94
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,194
when you grow up?

95
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:58,462
I always just assumed
I'd work on the docks.

96
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,864
Don't limit yourself, Meg.

97
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:01,632
Doctors wear a mask
most of the time,

98
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,434
so this isn't an issue.

99
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:05,219
If you're interested
the school has a program

100
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,787
where you can shadow
a real doctor

101
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,556
and learn more about
the medical field.

102
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,741
Yeah, wow, I'd love
to check that out.

103
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:11,993
Great, I'll set it up.

104
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,678
I didn't know a pig
could be a doctor.

105
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:14,779
Hey!

106
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,847
You get
just a few more of those.

107
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:21,891
Now, children, we're going

108
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,403
to learn who wears a hat.

109
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:25,356
Can a fireman wear
a hat?

110
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:26,991
-No? -Yes.
- Yes.

111
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,960
Can a policeman
wear a hat?

112
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:29,894
- No way.
- Yes.

113
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:31,045
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

114
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:32,446
Yes, he can, I knew that.

115
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:35,750
Now, you at home, tell me,
who else wears a hat?

116
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,485
A very formal horse?

117
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:38,686
Very good.

118
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:43,124
Even a bowling ball can wear a
hat if you use your imagination.

119
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,160
A bowling ball wearing a hat?

120
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:48,663
This is what high-def
was invented for.

121
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,831
Peter, what the hell
are you doing?

122
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,433
Being a good dad
like you asked.

123
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,301
I've been watching
Jolly Farm with Stewie

124
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:55,269
for the last
three hours.

125
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,972
That's not Stewie,
that's a pineapple.

126
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,041
Oh, my God, where is Stewie?

127
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:01,309
I don't know, but
I'm sure he's fine.

128
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,945
Peter, he's a baby.
You can't leave him alone.

129
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,863
Come on, it's good to
have some alone time.

130
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,099
You know, I spent a year
alone on a desert island

131
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,067
with nothing but a monkey
to keep me company.

132
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:12,970
You're saved, sir, we're going
to get you back to civilization.

133
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:14,872
And how about we bring along
your monkey pal?

134
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:15,690
Okay.

135
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:17,141
Yeah, we can teach
him sign language

136
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,509
and he can
tell us stories

137
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:20,344
about what you two did
on the island together.

138
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:22,964
No, n-no, no, no, let's, let's
not, let's not bring the monkey.

139
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,499
Um, I have a peanut M&M
up my nose

140
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,269
and it's now further up
than my finger can reach.

141
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:30,371
I am ready to farm
this out to someone.

142
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,340
Oh, Stewie, there you are.

143
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:35,092
Peter, I asked you to do one
simple thing-- watch the baby--

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,694
and you couldn't even do that.

145
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,262
Come on, Stewie.

146
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:40,264
Geez, why's she got
to be such a nag?

147
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,266
I wish she was more
like Mother Maggie.

148
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:45,236
Mother Maggie has an
announcement, lads and lasses.

149
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,672
I've had such fun playing
and learning with you

150
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:50,441
these last few years, but now,

151
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:54,745
just as bees must leave the
hive, I must leave Jolly Farm--

152
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,315
not that you asked, but to have
fertility treatments--

153
00:05:57,382 --> 00:06:01,018
so this will be our last episode
of Jolly Farm.

154
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:02,286
What? No.

155
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:04,188
They can't cancel Jolly Farm.

156
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:05,906
Peter, it's just a
stupid kids' show.

157
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,708
Just a stupid kids' show?

158
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,344
What about Pengrove Pig
and the Lollipop Luau?

159
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,779
I-I-I don't know.

160
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,114
This is going
to leave a void,

161
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:14,765
and somebody's got
to fill it.

162
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,900
I think you're overreacting.

163
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:17,301
You don't understand,
Brian.

164
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:19,353
What am I supposed to do
without Jolly Farm?

165
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,289
I'll be like an Italian mom
without bad kids.

166
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:25,926
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell
is all the commotion in here?

167
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,078
We're not doing anything.

168
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:28,512
You getting
fresh with me?

169
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,581
I'm tired of bailing both
of youse out of prison.

170
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:31,782
We're both in college

171
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,417
and we consistently make
the dean's list.

172
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:34,719
I'm telling your father.

173
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:35,820
Good.

174
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,392
Where the hell
is our food?

175
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,893
Yeah, where are
Mom and Dad?

176
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:44,595
And where's
that awesome finger painting

177
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:45,563
Stewie did this morning?

178
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,597
Oh, here it is.

179
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:47,698
Thank you for bringing it up.

180
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:49,066
I wasn't going to bring it up.

181
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:50,835
Well, what's
going on?

182
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:51,736
You haven't
eaten yet?

183
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:52,737
No.

184
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:54,038
Where's your father?

185
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:55,906
He was supposed to put
the lasagna in the oven.

186
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:58,609
I ask him to do one thing
while I'm at yoga.

187
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:00,311
You go to an intro class

188
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,879
and it's not even
at the yoga studio.

189
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:03,097
It's in someone's living room.

190
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:04,632
And that's not even a yoga mat.

191
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,801
That's the old pee pad
from my crib.

192
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:09,403
Uh, Lois, you might want
to check this out.

193
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,022
- What is it, Brian?
- Take a look.

194
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:16,944
<i>And now, boys and girls,
it's time for Petey's Funhouse.</i>

195
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:23,117
# It's gonna be fun
and we'll have lots of yuks #

196
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:25,686
# And maybe learn some stuff
but not definitely #

197
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:29,006
# It's the Petey's Funhouse
show. #

198
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,642
Ugh, another
Aaron Sorkin show

199
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,892
that's way over
everyone's head.

200
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:42,084
How the hell did you even get
a TV show, Peter?

201
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:43,752
I just answered an
ad off Craigslist,

202
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,688
and after several hours of
sexual torture, I had a show.

203
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:48,824
Don't answer that.

204
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:50,492
I gave out that
number under duress.

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,794
Lois, Peter's show is on the
local public access channel.

206
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:54,296
Anyone can have one.

207
00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:56,098
Yeah, Petey's Funhouse
is actually replacing

208
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,300
The Bad Audio Basement Show.

209
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:01,937
And once the hot glue dries,
your birdhouse will be complete.

210
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:03,972
Peter, you already do
nothing around the house

211
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,408
and now you're wasting
more time with this nonsense.

212
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:08,677
Geez, you're still getting
on my hump about this?

213
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:09,878
I help out around here.

214
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:11,613
Just this morning I
changed Meg's diaper

215
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:13,048
and I sent her
off to school.

216
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:15,617
Boy, can she kick, but
she left here spotless.

217
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:21,907
Dr. Hartman, thanks for
letting me shadow you.

218
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:24,076
I just know I'm going
to learn so much.

219
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:26,445
It's my pleasure, Meg,
and you're in good hands.

220
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:27,846
You see that diploma?

221
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:29,348
Yale Medical School.

222
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,216
Wow, that's impressive.

223
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,785
Thank you, I work very hard
on my calligraphy.

224
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:36,388
So, how about we take a little
stroll around the hospital?

225
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,506
This area is known
as a hallway.

226
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:39,858
Don't worry,
you'll pick up

227
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:42,344
on all the technical
doctor jargon pretty soon.

228
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:45,280
Hey, is it prescription
or perscription?

229
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:46,732
I think
it's prescription.

230
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:49,735
Prescription... that just
feels weird in my mouth.

231
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:52,454
Perscription is better.

232
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:54,022
Oh, and there's the E.R.

233
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:56,575
Don't go in there unless you
want everyone to yell at you.

234
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,534
Hi, kids, I'm Petey Griffin.

235
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:07,135
Hi, Petey!

236
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:09,721
We're going to have so much fun
on Petey's Funhouse today,

237
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:13,659
but before we begin, your friend
Petey wants to sing you a song.

238
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:17,412
# What makes you
so special? #

239
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,198
# The fact
that you are special #

240
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:22,551
# But if everybody's
special #

241
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:25,270
# That kinda
waters it down #

242
00:09:25,338 --> 00:09:27,923
# So some of you
ain't special #

243
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,676
# I can tell you
who is special #

244
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,894
# Like you and you
ain't special. #

245
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:34,696
And you are
and you're not.

246
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,702
Okay, kids, it's story time here
on Petey's Funhouse.

247
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,206
Today's story is
Lesbian Butts in '80s Jeans.

248
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:46,241
Ooh, that's a classic.

249
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:49,845
Once upon a time, some chick in
a leather jacket in front of me

250
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:52,147
in the parking lot walked
into Home Depot,

251
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:54,850
and her butt looked like this.

252
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:56,451
Everybody see this?

253
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,720
Everybody see
how shapeless this is?

254
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:02,224
She walked out of there with
a bag of soil on each shoulder.

255
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:03,892
Now, before I show you
this next one,

256
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,279
has anyone here ever heard
of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally?

257
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:12,050
I know we have a lot of yuks
here on Petey's Funhouse,

258
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:14,720
but one thing
that's not fun is a bully.

259
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:17,322
Now, how many of you kids out
there have ever gotten bullied?

260
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:19,558
Aw, come on up here

261
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,727
and tell us
about it, champ.

262
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:26,698
Well, my name is Winston,
and I'm quite fond of ballet.

263
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:28,867
One time I tried out
for Little League

264
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:31,370
in my ballet shoes,
and the other kids made

265
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:33,839
so much fun of me,
I wet my pants.

266
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,474
What, wait,
what, like pee?

267
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,942
- How old were you?
- Eight.

268
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,176
Aah, too old!

269
00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:40,512
Too old to be peeing yourself,
Baby Pee Pants.

270
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,314
All right,
you kids finish him off.

271
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,153
Hey, what do you
got there?

272
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,788
Oh, I'm just playing
with some Lee Logs.

273
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,256
What the hell
are Lee Logs?

274
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:52,924
A little something I
created-- Lee Logs.

275
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:54,292
Robert E. Lee.

276
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,228
You know, you got Lincoln
Logs, you got Lee Logs.

277
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:58,163
I don't get it, can,
can you build a house?

278
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,498
You can build quarters.

279
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:00,966
And people live there?

280
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:02,968
They live there if you
tell 'em to live there.

281
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,870
I don't know if I like
the idea of Lee Logs.

282
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:06,538
Yeah, they're not
selling very well.

283
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:08,306
Peter, dinner!

284
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:09,858
No dinner for
me tonight, Lois.

285
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:11,827
I have to go work on
a bit for tomorrow's show.

286
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:14,362
If I can kill 25
butterflies in a minute,

287
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,164
I won't have to show
the audience my balls.

288
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:18,566
Peter, this is the
fourth night in a row

289
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,435
you've skipped out on us
to work on your show.

290
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:22,671
Once again, I'm gonna be stuck
cleaning up the kitchen,

291
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:25,207
helping out with homework,
and bathing Stewie.

292
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:27,075
You know, I'd lay off
the nagging if I was you.

293
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:28,743
I'm a children's TV star now.

294
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:30,512
I can have any three-year-old
girl I want.

295
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:31,780
Just know that, Lois.

296
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:33,915
Peter, I'm only asking
you to do your share.

297
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:35,083
Well, it's getting
on my nerves.

298
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:36,218
Like, right now,

299
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:37,486
you are the most
annoying thing

300
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:40,088
in my life, with the
possible exception of Evite.

301
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:41,957
- What's this?
- It's this Web site you can use

302
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:43,225
to invite people
to stuff.

303
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,210
Does it have to be
a significant event?

304
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:46,695
No. Not at all!

305
00:11:46,763 --> 00:11:48,463
Well, do you just
get the invitation,

306
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:49,564
and that's the end of it?

307
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:52,116
No, it'll remind you
about it constantly!

308
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:54,619
Is there any way
I can customize this

309
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:57,640
to showcase my personality
through familiar clip art?

310
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:58,123
Yes!

311
00:11:58,191 --> 00:11:59,674
And what about
those replying?

312
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:01,560
Can they demonstrate
their sense of humor

313
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:03,261
through hilarious replies?

314
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:05,730
Yes, yes, yes to
everything you're saying!

315
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:07,866
I'm so excited
to get started!

316
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:10,702
You do that while
I jump out this window!

317
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:14,773
<i>Evite. Tell a friend
and then kill yourself.</i>

318
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:20,011
And then when you
get a little older,

319
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,646
stuff will come out.

320
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:24,916
Uh-oh!

321
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:27,769
Sounds like my cranky
new neighbor just got home.

322
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:29,437
I hope she doesn't
come over here

323
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:30,872
and give me the business.

324
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:33,174
Peter!

325
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:35,443
Oh, hi, Saggy Naggy.

326
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:37,128
Never mind with "hi!"

327
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:40,331
It sounds like someone's
having fun over here!

328
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,367
You know I don't
like that!

329
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:44,702
Hey, kids.
Meet Saggy Naggy.

330
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,838
Real nice lady, huh?

331
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:48,406
No!

332
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:50,041
What can I do for you,
Saggy Naggy?

333
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:51,726
You can stop having fun!

334
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:54,479
But we like fun,
don't we, kids?

335
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:55,764
Yes!

336
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:57,098
Well, too bad,

337
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,633
'cause you're all gonna
eat your vegetables,

338
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:00,919
listen to long stories
about my cousins,

339
00:13:00,986 --> 00:13:03,138
and help me
fold sheets!

340
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:05,373
And you! You're gonna
help around the house,

341
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,541
take out the garbage,

342
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:08,693
and give Stewie
his bottle!

343
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:10,428
Yeah, I heard it.
They say my name

344
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,664
on TV all the time;
calm down, bitch.

345
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,499
Make me dinner,
and go rent Twilight,

346
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:16,384
and do mouth
stuff on me,

347
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:18,753
even though it's been a
day-and-a-half since I've showered,

348
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:21,489
and I've used several public
bathrooms in the interim!

349
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:23,925
Sounds like this could
go on for a while, kids.

350
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:25,076
Hey, Saggy Naggy,

351
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:26,978
I know what'll cheer you up.

352
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:28,346
Do you like pie?

353
00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:29,764
I guess.

354
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:31,683
Well, how does this taste?

355
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:35,887
Well, I guess she thought

356
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:38,490
it was a no-pies-in-the-face
kind of neighborhood.

357
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:42,193
Wrong assessment
of the neighborhood, sweetheart!

358
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:47,398
And how are you today, Mr...

359
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:48,633
Pa-ti-ent?

360
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:50,235
My last name is Saunders.

361
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:52,220
That's an interesting
pronunciation.

362
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:53,988
This is Meg; she's
shadowing me today.

363
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:56,124
And boy, could she put
the applesauce away

364
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:58,009
in the commissary.
- Hi.

365
00:13:58,093 --> 00:13:59,961
Little tip, Meg:
The inside of this folder

366
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,863
has a diagram
of the human body.

367
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:03,198
Kind of a cheat sheet.

368
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,185
Now see, right now,
I'm listening for cancer.

369
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:09,470
Do you mean
his heartbeat?

370
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:11,523
Maybe. Here,
you take a turn.

371
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:15,143
Wow, your heartbeat
sounds a little fast.

372
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:17,378
- Do you smoke?
- Actually, I do.

373
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:19,180
Ah, me, too.
Isn't it great?

374
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:20,582
Well, that's bad for you.

375
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:21,683
You shouldn't do it.

376
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,017
It raises your heart rate

377
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:24,853
and can lead
to emphysema or cancer.

378
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,804
- That's impressive, Meg.
- It's no big deal.

379
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,806
It's just stuff
I learned in health class.

380
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,508
Well, you're clearly
a bright, young lady.

381
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:32,210
And you've got quite a...

382
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:34,262
head on your...

383
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,463
shoulders.

384
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:36,764
Thanks.

385
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:39,200
Dr. Hartman, you just got
this urgent message.

386
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:40,685
Oh, dear. Prilosec, huh?

387
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:41,953
No, it's below that.

388
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,187
Oh.

389
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:44,322
Oh, my God.

390
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,840
Meg, I'm afraid
my brother

391
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:47,208
just tried to kill
himself in prison.

392
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,443
I-I have to go.

393
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,478
You're gonna have to take
things from here, I guess.

394
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:51,880
What?! What are you
talking about?

395
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:54,098
Well, you now know
about as much as I do

396
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,049
about this whole
doctor thing.

397
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,901
But I have no formal
medical training.

398
00:14:56,969 --> 00:14:58,970
Ah, you'll be fine.
I think that book on the shelf

399
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:00,405
has most of the
stuff in there.

400
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:03,374
And don't forget the cheat sheet
if you need a helping...

401
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:05,360
hand.

402
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:11,099
Are we really
buying fish

403
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,501
at the same place
we buy tires?

404
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,803
And, w-what... "Fazio"?

405
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:18,206
What, is that a brand
of Blu-ray player?

406
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:20,925
Stewie, this sweatshirt
is so sophisticated.

407
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:22,694
Look, it says New York.

408
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,662
People will think
I'm from there.

409
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:29,751
Put your phone away;
we're at a funeral!

410
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:31,353
Oh, my God.

411
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,787
Look!

412
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:34,522
It's Saggy Naggy.

413
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,507
Boo!

414
00:15:35,574 --> 00:15:36,708
You're mean.

415
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:38,243
I don't like you,
Saggy Naggy.

416
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:40,228
You stink, Saggy Naggy.

417
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:41,963
My goodness, that's
a very rude thing

418
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,198
to say to someone.

419
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:44,766
Calling them Saggy...

420
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:47,552
What the hell?!

421
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,537
Young man, what do
you think you're...

422
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:05,065
Lois, I just saw
Jessica Alba on television.

423
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:06,483
We've got 90 seconds;
let's go!

424
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:07,684
Peter, I'm not
in the mood!

425
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:09,186
That's okay. We can
do it anyway.

426
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:11,455
Peter, I was assaulted
in public because of you!

427
00:16:11,522 --> 00:16:13,206
Oh, my God, what happened?!

428
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:14,374
I'll tell you
what happened.

429
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:16,543
A group of kids
attacked me at Costmart

430
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:18,478
because you portrayed
me on your show

431
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,213
as a raging
puppet bitch!

432
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:21,881
Writers take
from their lives.

433
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:24,084
You married a creative type.
You knew this was a risk.

434
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,785
What's that
supposed to mean?

435
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:28,055
Well, the last few weeks, you've
been nagging the hell out of me.

436
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:29,956
Peter, you think
I like nagging you?

437
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:32,258
One of us needs to be
an adult in this marriage,

438
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,693
and it's clearly not you.

439
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:35,696
Is this about me wetting
the bed just now?

440
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:36,997
Peter, don't
you understand

441
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,932
that I'm just looking
out for this family?

442
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
Besides, without
my nagging,

443
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:42,035
you'd probably
get yourself killed.

444
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:44,638
Or laid. Right,
frat house?

445
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:47,040
Yeah!

446
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,943
Those knuckleheads
should be studying.

447
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:51,978
Okay, you know what?
Fine, Peter, that's it.

448
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:54,247
From now on, I'm not
nagging you anymore.

449
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:56,416
- You're not?
- No, you're on your own.

450
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:59,136
I'm done with it.
I'm done with all of it!

451
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:01,571
Well, great, I should
probably get some sleep.

452
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,074
Tomorrow on Petey's Funhouse,
we're doing who's on first.

453
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:05,075
I'm gonna play
Costello,

454
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:07,711
and Abbott is gonna
be played by live puma.

455
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:10,313
Peter, that sounds
really d...

456
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:12,449
you know what?
Sounds great.

457
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:13,417
Have fun.

458
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,118
Thanks, Lois.
Good night.

459
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,941
- Lois? Other families fight,
too, right? - Not this much.

460
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,176
Do you think maybe
we should think about

461
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:24,211
getting a...
- It is what it is.

462
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,246
Let's just get Stewie to
college and go from there.

463
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:31,518
Sir, if you're gonna
want me to examine

464
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:32,752
where you're
having an issue,

465
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,021
you're gonna have to be more
specific than "thingee".

466
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,257
Okay. It's not
the front thingee.

467
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,209
What's going on in here?

468
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:40,711
Where's Dr. Hartman?

469
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:44,107
He had a family emergency.
I'm not really a doctor

470
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:45,536
but I've been sort of
filling in for him.

471
00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:46,316
You what?!

472
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,719
Well, I think I want
to go into medicine,

473
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:50,220
so I was shadowing
Dr. Hartman.

474
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:51,922
I've actually
been learning a lot,

475
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,724
but then he just left me here!

476
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,158
Well, you don't belong here!

477
00:17:55,226 --> 00:17:57,260
This is a professional
medical institution

478
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,529
with standards
and regulations to adhere to!

479
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:00,597
But, but I...

480
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:02,399
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

481
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,534
I'm sorry.
I'll go.

482
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,008
My issue has
resolved itself.

483
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,247
And don't go anywhere, kids,

484
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:19,382
'cause coming up,
we got some classic comedy

485
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,684
with me and a puma.

486
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:22,619
Is Dad really gonna do this?

487
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:24,955
I told your father I was
gonna leave him alone.

488
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,123
Saggy Naggy is
keeping out of this.

489
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,325
Is the puma ready?

490
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:32,580
Maybe we should poke him with
the "is-the-Puma-ready?" stick.

491
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:37,551
Oh, my god, I can't
let him do this!

492
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,153
Come on, kids! We got to get
down to that TV studio!

493
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:42,800
Okay, yeah, just step on
the coloring book. That's cool.

494
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,680
I'm asking you
who's on first?

495
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:55,936
Oh, my God! Peter!

496
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:57,287
Cut the camera! Cut it!

497
00:18:57,354 --> 00:18:59,289
Roll a
"Petey Learn-A-Long Song"!

498
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:05,428
# Kentucky is a state #

499
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:07,113
# Kentucky is a state #

500
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,382
# All the people there
are dicks #

501
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,285
# Kentucky is a state. #

502
00:19:12,353 --> 00:19:14,404
Oh, he's hurt bad.
Someone call 911!

503
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:15,305
He's bleeding too much!

504
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:16,840
He needs attention now!

505
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:19,176
Somebody help him!
Do something!

506
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:21,077
Now she's nagging everyone.

507
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:22,913
Does anyone have
any medical training?!

508
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,781
It looks like his
jugular is severed.

509
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:26,550
I learned this
at the hospital.

510
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:28,752
Mr. Swanson, find me
a first-aid kit!

511
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,687
Mom, hand me those towels.

512
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:33,757
Did I hold on to the ball?

513
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:34,825
Hang in there, Dad.

514
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:36,259
I'm gonna get you fixed up.

515
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,386
You can do it, Meg.

516
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:49,072
Come on, Meg.
You've got to save him!

517
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:52,125
Peter, you need to let go.

518
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:05,789
L-Lois?

519
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:08,491
Oh, Peter, thank God!
You're okay.

520
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,827
I guess you were right
about that puma.

521
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,462
I don't know what
I was thinking.

522
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,964
I should've
listened to you.

523
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:15,966
Peter, I don't
care about that.

524
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:19,085
I acted like a real jerk,
and I'm sorry, Lois.

525
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:20,654
I know you just
get on my case

526
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:22,055
'cause you're
looking out for me.

527
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:23,290
I am, Peter.

528
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,591
And it's only because
I love you

529
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,694
and I want the best for you
and our family.

530
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,429
I love you, too, Lois.

531
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,833
Isn't anybody
gonna thank me?

532
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,835
Yeah, I'll have a water
if you're getting one.

533
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,655
Mr. Griffin,
you have a visitor.

534
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:41,093
- Hey.
- Hey. I get it now.

535
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,200
- "Who" is the man's name.
- Aha, ah!
