12
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:36,484
Need to move?

13
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:37,485
No problem.

14
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:39,387
Take it yourself with U-Haul.

15
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:40,988
But I've never driven
a truck before.

16
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:42,290
<i>No problem.</i>

17
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:44,642
<i>U-Haul lets anyone drive</i>
<i>a giant truck,</i>

18
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,079
<i>even though it's dangerous,</i>
<i>because, hey, you're moving.</i>

19
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,669
Sorry, I'm making a go
of it in a new city.

20
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:56,871
All right, I'll see you
guys in a couple of days.

21
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,172
Where are you going?

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,741
I'm off to take pictures
of lesbian butts.

23
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:01,225
What?

24
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,344
Joe and Quagmire and I are
making a coffee table book

25
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:05,379
called <i>Lesbian Butts</i>
<i>in '80s Jeans.</i>

26
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:07,749
I already got the first
chapter right here.

27
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:09,817
Where'd you take
all these pictures?

28
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:11,969
You know, coffee houses,
Chevy dealerships,

29
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,354
all the usual places.

30
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:14,355
Peter, you're not
doing that.

31
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:15,890
I got a ton
of errands to run,

32
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:17,525
and I need your help
around here.

33
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:19,160
Well, fine, if I
can't do the book

34
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:20,695
I'm gonna hurt
something you love.

35
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:28,469
You happy now?

36
00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:30,588
Maybe we should discuss this
in the other room.

37
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:32,190
I don't like fighting
in front of the kids.

38
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:33,991
No, I want to fight
in front of the kids.

39
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:35,877
I feed off the excitement
of an audience.

40
00:01:35,944 --> 00:01:37,478
Peter, for once
you're going to stay here

41
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:38,746
and help
around the house.

42
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:40,848
Now, I need you to watch
Stewie till I get back.

43
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:45,052
Whoever did this, thank you.

44
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:50,775
All right, Stewie,
since Lois says

45
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:52,009
I got to keep
an eye on you,

46
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:54,278
we might as well have
some father-son time,

47
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:55,496
so I'm gonna measure
your penis

48
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,165
and then I'm gonna
measure my penis,

49
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:58,833
and we're gonna see
whose is bigger.

50
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,001
Doesn't really
seem fair.

51
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,953
All right, let's see
what you got.

52
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,405
Stupid game anyway.

53
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:06,073
Hey, kids, coming up next,

54
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:08,376
it's the <i>Jolly Farm Revue</i>
marathon.

55
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:09,527
No, no, don't
switch it.

56
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:10,394
I want to watch
<i>Jolly Farm.</i>

57
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:11,863
Son of a bitch.

58
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,398
I got to spend the rest of the
day watching stupid kid shows.

59
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,083
I'd rather watch paint dry.

60
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:28,429
Nice.

61
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,668
Wakey, wakey.

62
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:35,670
Good morning, Mother Maggie.

63
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:37,071
Heh, who's this?

64
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,206
I like this lady.

65
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:39,507
Hey, do you think
Mother Maggie

66
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:40,775
is married to
Father Fa...?

67
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:42,259
Oh, probably not.

68
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,611
And the unicorn slid

69
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:46,464
down the rainbow
to a field of jellybeans

70
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:48,633
where she
and the other villagers decided

71
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,536
it had been the best day ever.

72
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,554
Oh, look, it's Pengrove Pig,

73
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:56,090
and he's sharing
his apples nicely, isn't he?

74
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:58,376
Like a champ he is.

75
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:02,797
♪ Head, shoulders, knees,
and toes, knees and toes. ♪

76
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:06,234
And that's how you make a duck
out of an oatmeal container.

77
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:09,237
This is the greatest show
in the history of television.

78
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:12,206
Mother Maggie, you are
a kindred spirit.

79
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:14,208
This must be how twins
who are separated at birth

80
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:15,977
feel when they first meet.

81
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,400
Trade house keys,
bang each other's wives?

82
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,302
Yep.

83
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,609
I can't dissect
this pig, Mr. Kingman.

84
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:33,077
It's against
my religion.

85
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:34,378
Believe me, Neil,
it's no thrill

86
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,047
for the pig to
touch a Jew either.

87
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:37,848
Okay, how about you,
Meg, how are you doing?

88
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,383
Pretty good.

89
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:42,320
It's, it's kind of cool
cutting something that's not me.

90
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:44,355
Wow, that's some
very impressive work.

91
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:47,291
It's easy for Meg to dissect
a pig because she is a pig.

92
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:49,777
Hey!

93
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:51,412
All right,
I'll let that one slide.

94
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,147
Meg, you have some
real potential.

95
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:54,715
Have you ever thought
about becoming a doctor

96
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:55,917
when you grow up?

97
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:58,185
I always just assumed
I'd work on the docks.

98
00:03:58,253 --> 00:03:59,587
Don't limit
yourself, Meg.

99
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,355
Doctors wear a mask
most of the time,

100
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:03,157
so this isn't
an issue.

101
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:04,942
If you're interested
the school has a program

102
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,510
where you can shadow
a real doctor

103
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:08,279
and learn more about
the medical field.

104
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:10,464
Yeah, wow, I'd love
to check that out.

105
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:11,716
Great, I'll
set it up.

106
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:13,401
I didn't know a pig
could be a doctor.

107
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:14,502
Hey!

108
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:16,570
You get
just a few more of those.

109
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,614
Now, children, we're going

110
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,126
to learn who wears a hat.

111
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:25,079
Can a fireman wear
a hat?

112
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:26,714
Yes.
No? Yes.

113
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:28,683
Can a policeman
wear a hat?

114
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,617
Yes.
No way.

115
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:30,768
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

116
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,169
Yes, he can, I knew that.

117
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:35,473
Now, you at home, tell me,
who else wears a hat?

118
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,208
A very formal horse?

119
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,709
Very good.

120
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:42,847
Even a bowling ball can wear a
hat if you use your imagination.

121
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,883
A bowling ball wearing a hat?

122
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,386
This is what high-def
was invented for.

123
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:50,554
Peter, what the hell
are you doing?

124
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:52,156
Being a good dad
like you asked.

125
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,724
I've been watching
<i>Jolly Farm</i> with Stewie

126
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:54,992
for the last
three hours.

127
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,695
That's not Stewie,
that's a pineapple.

128
00:04:57,763 --> 00:04:59,764
Oh, my God, where is Stewie?

129
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,032
I don't know, but
I'm sure he's fine.

130
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,033
Peter, he's a baby.

131
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,668
You can't leave him alone.

132
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:05,586
Come on, it's good to
have some alone time.

133
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:07,822
You know, I spent a year
alone on a desert island

134
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,790
with nothing but a monkey
to keep me company.

135
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:12,393
You're saved, sir, we're going
to get you back to civilization.

136
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:14,195
And how about we bring along
your monkey pal?

137
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:15,413
Okay.

138
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,864
Yeah, we can teach
him sign language

139
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:18,232
and he can
tell us stories

140
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,067
about what you two did
on the island together.

141
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:22,687
No, n-no, no, no, let's, let's
not, let's not bring the monkey.

142
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:25,222
Um, I have a peanut M&M
up my nose

143
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,992
and it's now further up
than my finger can reach.

144
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,094
I am ready to farm
this out to someone.

145
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,063
Oh, Stewie, there you are.

146
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:34,815
Peter, I asked you to do one
simple thing-- watch the baby--

147
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:36,417
and you couldn't even do that.

148
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:37,985
Come on, Stewie.

149
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,987
Geez, why's she got
to be such a nag?

150
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,989
I wish she was more
like Mother Maggie.

151
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:44,959
Mother Maggie has an
announcement, lads and lasses.

152
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:47,395
I've had such fun playing
and learning with you

153
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:50,164
these last few years, but now,

154
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:54,468
just as bees must leave the
hive, I must leave Jolly Farm--

155
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:57,038
not that you asked, but to have
fertility treatments--

156
00:05:57,105 --> 00:06:00,741
so this will be our last episode
of <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

157
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,009
What? No.

158
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:03,911
They can't cancel <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

159
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,629
Peter, it's just a
stupid kids' show.

160
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:07,431
Just a stupid
kids' show?

161
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:10,067
What about Pengrove Pig
and the Lollipop Luau?

162
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:11,502
I-I-I don't know.

163
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,837
This is going
to leave a void,

164
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,488
and somebody's got
to fill it.

165
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:15,623
I think you're
overreacting.

166
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,024
You don't understand,
Brian.

167
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:19,076
What am I supposed to do
without <i>Jolly Farm?</i>

168
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:22,012
I'll be like an Italian mom
without bad kids.

169
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,649
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell
is all the commotion in here?

170
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,801
We're not doing anything.

171
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:28,235
You getting
fresh with me?

172
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:30,304
I'm tired of bailing both
of youse out of prison.

173
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:31,505
We're both
in college

174
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:33,140
and we consistently make
the dean's list.

175
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,442
I'm telling
your father.

176
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:35,543
Good.

177
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,115
Where the hell
is our food?

178
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:42,616
Yeah, where are
Mom and Dad?

179
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,318
And where's
that awesome finger painting

180
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:45,286
Stewie did this morning?

181
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:46,320
Oh, here it is.

182
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:47,421
Thank you for bringing it up.

183
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:48,789
I wasn't going to bring it up.

184
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:50,558
Well, what's
going on?

185
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,459
You haven't
eaten yet?

186
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:52,460
No.

187
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:53,761
Where's your father?

188
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,629
He was supposed to put
the lasagna in the oven.

189
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:58,332
I ask him to do one thing
while I'm at yoga.

190
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,034
You go to an intro class

191
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:01,602
and it's not even
at the yoga studio.

192
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,820
It's in someone's living room.

193
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:04,355
And that's not even a yoga mat.

194
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,524
That's the old pee pad
from my crib.

195
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,126
Uh, Lois, you might want
to check this out.

196
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:11,745
What is it, Brian?
Take a look.

197
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,667
And now, boys and girls,
it's time for <i>Petey's Funhouse.</i>

198
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:22,840
♪ It's gonna be fun
and we'll have lots of yuks ♪

199
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:25,409
♪ And maybe learn some stuff
but not definitely ♪

200
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:28,729
♪ It's the <i>Petey's Funhouse</i>
show. ♪

201
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:31,365
Ugh, another
Aaron Sorkin show

202
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:33,367
that's way over
everyone's head.

203
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:41,291
How the hell did you even get
a TV show, Peter?

204
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,959
I just answered an
ad off Craigslist,

205
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,895
and after several hours of
sexual torture, I had a show.

206
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,031
Don't answer that.

207
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:49,699
I gave out that
number under duress.

208
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:52,001
Lois, Peter's show is on the
local public access channel.

209
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:53,503
Anyone can have one.

210
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,305
Yeah, <i>Petey's Funhouse</i>
is actually replacing

211
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:57,507
<i>The Bad Audio Basement Show.</i>

212
00:07:57,575 --> 00:08:01,144
And once the hot glue dries,
your birdhouse will be complete.

213
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:03,179
Peter, you already do
nothing around the house

214
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:05,615
and now you're wasting
more time with this nonsense.

215
00:08:05,682 --> 00:08:07,884
Geez, you're still getting
on my hump about this?

216
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:09,085
I help out
around here.

217
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:10,820
Just this morning I
changed Meg's diaper

218
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:12,255
and I sent her
off to school.

219
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:14,824
Boy, can she kick, but
she left here spotless.

220
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:21,114
Dr. Hartman, thanks for
letting me shadow you.

221
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:23,283
I just know I'm going
to learn so much.

222
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,652
It's my pleasure, Meg,
and you're in good hands.

223
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,053
You see that diploma?

224
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:28,555
Yale Medical School.

225
00:08:28,622 --> 00:08:30,423
Wow, that's
impressive.

226
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:32,992
Thank you, I work very hard
on my calligraphy.

227
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,595
So, how about we take a little
stroll around the hospital?

228
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,713
This area is known
as a hallway.

229
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:39,065
Don't worry,
you'll pick up

230
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,551
on all the technical
doctor jargon pretty soon.

231
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:44,487
Hey, is it prescription
or perscription?

232
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:45,939
I think
it's prescription.

233
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:48,942
Prescription... that just
feels weird in my mouth.

234
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:51,661
Perscription is better.

235
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:53,229
Oh, and there's the E.R.

236
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,782
Don't go in there unless you
want everyone to yell at you.

237
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:04,741
Hi, kids, I'm Petey Griffin.

238
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:06,342
Hi, Petey!

239
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,928
We're going to have so much fun
on <i>Petey's Funhouse</i> today,

240
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:12,866
but before we begin, your friend
Petey wants to sing you a song.

241
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:16,619
♪ What makes you
so special? ♪

242
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:19,405
♪ The fact
that you are special ♪

243
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:21,758
♪ But if everybody's
special ♪

244
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:24,477
♪ That kinda
waters it down ♪

245
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:27,130
♪ So some of you
ain't special ♪

246
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,883
♪ I can tell you
who is special ♪

247
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,101
♪ Like you and you
ain't special. ♪

248
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:33,903
And you are
and you're not.

249
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,909
Okay, kids, it's story time here
on <i>Petey's Funhouse.</i>

250
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:43,413
Today's story is
<i>Lesbian Butts in '80s Jeans.</i>

251
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,448
Ooh, that's a classic.

252
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:49,052
Once upon a time, some chick in
a leather jacket in front of me

253
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:51,354
in the parking lot walked
into Home Depot,

254
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:54,057
and her butt looked like this.

255
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:55,658
Everybody see this?

256
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:57,927
Everybody see
how shapeless this is?

257
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:01,431
She walked out of there with
a bag of soil on each shoulder.

258
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:03,099
Now, before I show you
this next one,

259
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:06,486
has anyone here ever heard
of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally?

260
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:11,257
I know we have a lot of yuks
here on <i>Petey's Funhouse,</i>

261
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:13,927
but one thing
that's not fun is a bully.

262
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:16,529
Now, how many of you kids out
there have ever gotten bullied?

263
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:18,765
Aw, come on up here

264
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:20,934
and tell us
about it, champ.

265
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:25,905
Well, my name is Winston,
and I'm quite fond of ballet.

266
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,074
One time I tried out
for Little League

267
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:30,577
in my ballet shoes,
and the other kids made

268
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:33,046
so much fun of me,
I wet my pants.

269
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:34,681
What, wait,
what, like pee?

270
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:36,149
How old were you?
Eight.

271
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,383
Aah, too old!

272
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,719
Too old to be peeing yourself,
Baby Pee Pants.

273
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:41,521
All right,
you kids finish him off.

274
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:47,360
Hey, what do you
got there?

275
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:48,995
Oh, I'm just playing
with some Lee Logs.

276
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:50,463
What the hell
are Lee Logs?

277
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:52,131
A little something I
created-- Lee Logs.

278
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:53,499
Robert E. Lee.

279
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,435
You know, you got Lincoln
Logs, you got Lee Logs.

280
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:57,370
I don't get it, can,
can you build a house?

281
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:58,705
You can build
quarters.

282
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:00,173
And people live there?

283
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:02,175
They live there if you
tell 'em to live there.

284
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:04,077
I don't know if I like
the idea of Lee Logs.

285
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:05,745
Yeah, they're not
selling very well.

286
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:07,513
Peter, dinner!

287
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:08,765
No dinner for
me tonight, Lois.

288
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:11,034
I have to go work on
a bit for tomorrow's show.

289
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:13,269
If I can kill 25
butterflies in a minute,

290
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:15,371
I won't have to show
the audience my balls.

291
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,473
Peter, this is the
fourth night in a row

292
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,642
you've skipped out on us
to work on your show.

293
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,878
Once again, I'm gonna be stuck
cleaning up the kitchen,

294
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:24,414
helping out with homework,
and bathing Stewie.

295
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:26,282
You know, I'd lay off
the nagging if I was you.

296
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,650
I'm a children's TV star now.

297
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:29,419
I can have any three-year-old
girl I want.

298
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:30,987
Just know that, Lois.

299
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:33,122
Peter, I'm only asking
you to do your share.

300
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,290
Well, it's getting
on my nerves.

301
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:35,425
Like, right now,

302
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:36,693
you are the most
annoying thing

303
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,295
in my life, with the
possible exception of Evite.

304
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:41,164
What's this?
It's this Web site you can use

305
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:42,432
to invite people
to stuff.

306
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,417
Does it have to be
a significant event?

307
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:45,902
No. Not at all!

308
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,370
Well, do you just
get the invitation,

309
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:48,771
and that's the end of it?

310
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,723
No, it'll remind you
about it constantly!

311
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,126
Is there any way
I can customize this

312
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:55,962
to showcase my personality
through familiar clip art?

313
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,330
Yes!

314
00:11:57,398 --> 00:11:58,881
And what about
those replying?

315
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,767
Can they demonstrate
their sense of humor

316
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,168
through hilarious replies?

317
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:04,637
Yes, yes, yes to
everything you're saying!

318
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:07,073
I'm so excited
to get started!

319
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:09,309
You do that while
I jump out this window!

320
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:13,980
<i>Evite. Tell a friend</i>
<i>and then kill yourself.</i>

321
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:18,918
And then when you
get a little older,

322
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:20,553
stuff will come out.

323
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:23,823
Uh-oh!

324
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,676
Sounds like my cranky
new neighbor just got home.

325
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,344
I hope she doesn't
come over here

326
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:29,779
and give me the business.

327
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:32,081
Peter!

328
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:34,350
Oh, hi, Saggy Naggy.

329
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:36,035
Never mind with "hi!"

330
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:39,238
It sounds like someone's
having fun over here!

331
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:41,274
You know I don't
like that!

332
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:43,609
Hey, kids.
Meet Saggy Naggy.

333
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,745
Real nice lady, huh?

334
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:47,313
No!

335
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:48,948
What can I do for you,
Saggy Naggy?

336
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:50,633
You can stop having fun!

337
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:53,386
But we like fun,
don't we, kids?

338
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:54,671
Yes!

339
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:56,005
Well, too bad,

340
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:57,540
'cause you're all gonna
eat your vegetables,

341
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:59,826
listen to long stories
about my cousins,

342
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:02,045
and help me
fold sheets!

343
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:04,280
And you! You're gonna
help around the house,

344
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:05,448
take out the garbage,

345
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:07,600
and give Stewie
his bottle!

346
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:09,335
Yeah, I heard it.
They say my name

347
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:11,571
on TV all the time;
calm down, bitch.

348
00:13:11,638 --> 00:13:13,406
Make me dinner,
and go rent <i>Twilight,</i>

349
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:15,291
and do mouth
stuff on me,

350
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,660
even though it's been a
day-and-a-half since I've showered,

351
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:20,396
and I've used several public
bathrooms in the interim!

352
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:22,832
Sounds like this could
go on for a while, kids.

353
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,983
Hey, Saggy Naggy,

354
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:25,885
I know what'll cheer you up.

355
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:27,253
Do you like pie?

356
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:28,671
I guess.

357
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:30,590
Well, how does this taste?

358
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:35,094
Well, I guess she thought

359
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,397
it was a no-pies-in-the-face
kind of neighborhood.

360
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:41,100
Wrong assessment
of the neighborhood, sweetheart!

361
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:46,305
And how are you today, Mr...

362
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:47,540
Pa-ti-ent?

363
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:49,142
My last name is Saunders.

364
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,127
That's an interesting
pronunciation.

365
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,895
This is Meg; she's
shadowing me today.

366
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,031
And boy, could she put
the applesauce away

367
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,916
in the commissary.
Hi.

368
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,868
Little tip, Meg:
The inside of this folder

369
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:00,770
has a diagram
of the human body.

370
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:02,105
Kind of a cheat sheet.

371
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:06,092
Now see, right now,
I'm listening for cancer.

372
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,377
Do you mean
his heartbeat?

373
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,430
Maybe. Here,
you take a turn.

374
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:14,050
Wow, your heartbeat
sounds a little fast.

375
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:16,285
Do you smoke?
Actually, I do.

376
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:18,087
Ah, me, too.
Isn't it great?

377
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,489
Well, that's
bad for you.

378
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:20,590
You shouldn't do it.

379
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:21,924
It raises your heart rate

380
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:23,760
and can lead
to emphysema or cancer.

381
00:14:23,827 --> 00:14:25,711
That's impressive, Meg.
It's no big deal.

382
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,713
It's just stuff
I learned in health class.

383
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:29,415
Well, you're clearly
a bright, young lady.

384
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,117
And you've got quite a...

385
00:14:31,185 --> 00:14:33,169
head on your...

386
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:34,370
shoulders.

387
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:35,671
Thanks.

388
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:38,107
Dr. Hartman, you just got
this urgent message.

389
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:39,592
Oh, dear.
Prilosec, huh?

390
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,860
No, it's below that.

391
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:42,094
Oh.

392
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:43,229
Oh, my God.

393
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:44,447
Meg, I'm afraid
my brother

394
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:45,815
just tried to kill
himself in prison.

395
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:47,350
I-I have to go.

396
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:49,385
You're gonna have to take
things from here, I guess.

397
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:50,787
What?! What are you
talking about?

398
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:53,005
Well, you now know
about as much as I do

399
00:14:53,073 --> 00:14:54,256
about this whole
doctor thing.

400
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:55,808
But I have no formal
medical training.

401
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,877
Ah, you'll be fine.
I think that book on the shelf

402
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:59,612
has most of the
stuff in there.

403
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,281
And don't forget the cheat sheet
if you need a helping...

404
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:04,267
hand.

405
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,006
Are we really
buying fish

406
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:12,408
at the same place
we buy tires?

407
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,710
And, w-what... "Fazio"?

408
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:17,113
What, is that a brand
of Blu-ray player?

409
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:19,532
Stewie, this sweatshirt
is so sophisticated.

410
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,601
Look, it says New York.

411
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:23,569
People will think
I'm from there.

412
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:28,958
Put your phone away;
we're at a funeral!

413
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:30,560
Oh, my God.

414
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:31,994
Look!

415
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,729
It's Saggy Naggy.

416
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:34,714
Boo!

417
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:35,915
You're mean.

418
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:37,450
I don't like you,
Saggy Naggy.

419
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:39,435
You stink, Saggy Naggy.

420
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,170
My goodness, that's
a very rude thing

421
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:42,405
to say to someone.

422
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:43,973
Calling them Saggy...

423
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:46,759
What the hell?!

424
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:48,744
Young man, what do
you think you're...

425
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:03,038
Lois, I just saw
Jessica Alba on television.

426
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:04,456
We've got 90 seconds;
let's go!

427
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:05,657
Peter, I'm not
in the mood!

428
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,159
That's okay. We can
do it anyway.

429
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:09,428
Peter, I was assaulted
in public because of you!

430
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:11,179
Oh, my God, what happened?!

431
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:12,347
I'll tell you
what happened.

432
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:14,516
A group of kids
attacked me at Costmart

433
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,451
because you portrayed
me on your show

434
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,186
as a raging
puppet bitch!

435
00:16:18,254 --> 00:16:19,554
Writers take
from their lives.

436
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:21,757
You married a creative type.
You knew this was a risk.

437
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,458
What's that
supposed to mean?

438
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:26,028
Well, the last few weeks, you've
been nagging the hell out of me.

439
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,629
Peter, you think
I like nagging you?

440
00:16:27,697 --> 00:16:29,931
One of us needs to be
an adult in this marriage,

441
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,366
and it's clearly not you.

442
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:33,669
Is this about me wetting
the bed just now?

443
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:34,970
Peter, don't
you understand

444
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:36,905
that I'm just looking
out for this family?

445
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,073
Besides, without
my nagging,

446
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:40,008
you'd probably
get yourself killed.

447
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:42,611
Or laid. Right,
frat house?

448
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,013
Yeah!

449
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:47,916
Those knuckleheads
should be studying.

450
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:49,951
Okay, you know what?
Fine, Peter, that's it.

451
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,620
From now on, I'm not
nagging you anymore.

452
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:52,688
You're not?

453
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:54,389
No, you're on your own.

454
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:57,109
I'm done with it.
I'm done with all of it!

455
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:59,544
Well, great, I should
probably get some sleep.

456
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:01,747
Tomorrow on Petey's Funhouse,
we're doing who's on first.

457
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:03,048
I'm gonna play
Costello,

458
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:05,684
and Abbott is gonna
be played by live puma.

459
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:08,286
Peter, that sounds
really d...

460
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:10,122
you know what?
Sounds great.

461
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:11,390
Have fun.

462
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:14,176
Thanks, Lois.
Good night.

463
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:17,312
Lois? Other families
fight, too, right?

464
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,914
Not this much.

465
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:20,649
Do you think maybe
we should think about

466
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:22,184
getting a...
It is what it is.

467
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,219
Let's just get Stewie to
college and go from there.

468
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:29,091
Sir, if you're gonna
want me to examine

469
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:30,525
where you're
having an issue,

470
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:32,994
you're gonna have to be more
specific than "thingee".

471
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:35,397
Okay. It's not
the front thingee.

472
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:37,182
What's going on in here?

473
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,684
Where's Dr. Hartman?

474
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:41,219
He had a family emergency.
I'm not really a doctor

475
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:43,021
but I've been sort of
filling in for him.

476
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:44,289
You what?!

477
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:46,692
Well, I think I want
to go into medicine,

478
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,193
so I was shadowing
Dr. Hartman.

479
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,895
I've actually
been learning a lot,

480
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:51,697
but then he just left me here!

481
00:17:51,764 --> 00:17:53,131
Well, you don't belong here!

482
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:55,233
This is a professional
medical institution

483
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:57,502
with standards
and regulations to adhere to!

484
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,570
But, but I...

485
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:00,372
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

486
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,507
I'm sorry.
I'll go.

487
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,981
My issue has
resolved itself.

488
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:15,020
And don't go anywhere, kids,

489
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:17,055
'cause coming up,
we got some classic comedy

490
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:18,657
with me and a puma.

491
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:20,592
Is Dad really gonna do this?

492
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,728
I told your father I was
gonna leave him alone.

493
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:24,896
Saggy Naggy is
keeping out of this.

494
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:26,298
Is the puma ready?

495
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:27,966
Maybe we should
poke him with the

496
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:30,535
"is-the-Puma-ready?"
stick.

497
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:35,524
Oh, my god, I can't
let him do this!

498
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:38,126
Come on, kids! We got to get
down to that TV studio!

499
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:39,778
Okay, yeah, just step
on the coloring book.

500
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:40,712
That's cool.

501
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:48,453
I'm asking you
who's on first?

502
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:53,909
Oh, my God! Peter!

503
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,260
Cut the camera! Cut it!

504
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:57,262
Roll a
"Petey Learn-A-Long Song"!

505
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,784
♪ Kentucky is a state ♪

506
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:05,086
♪ Kentucky is a state ♪

507
00:19:05,154 --> 00:19:07,355
♪ All the people there
are dicks ♪

508
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:10,258

509
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:12,077
Oh, he's hurt bad.
Someone call 911!

510
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:13,278
He's bleeding too much!

511
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:14,813
He needs attention now!

512
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:17,149
Somebody help him!
Do something!

513
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:19,050
Now she's nagging everyone.

514
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:20,886
Does anyone have
any medical training?!

515
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,754
It looks like his
jugular is severed.

516
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,523
I learned this
at the hospital.

517
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,725
Mr. Swanson, find me
a first-aid kit!

518
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,660
Mom, hand me those towels.

519
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:31,730
Did I hold on to the ball?

520
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:32,798
Hang in there, Dad.

521
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:34,232
I'm gonna get you fixed up.

522
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:44,359
You can do it, Meg.

523
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:47,045
Come on, Meg.
You've got to save him!

524
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:50,098
Peter, you need to let go.

525
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:03,762
L-Lois?

526
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,130
Oh, Peter, thank God!

527
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:06,464
You're okay.

528
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:08,800
I guess you were right
about that puma.

529
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,435
I don't know what
I was thinking.

530
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:11,937
I should've
listened to you.

531
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,939
Peter, I don't
care about that.

532
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,658
I acted like a real jerk,
and I'm sorry, Lois.

533
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,527
I know you just
get on my case

534
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,028
'cause you're
looking out for me.

535
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:21,263
I am, Peter.

536
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,964
And it's only because
I love you

537
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:25,367
and I want the best for you
and our family.

538
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,102
I love you, too, Lois.

539
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,206
Isn't anybody
gonna thank me?

540
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:33,508
Yeah, I'll have a water
if you're getting one.

541
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:35,794
Mr. Griffin,
you have a visitor.

542
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:37,012
Hey.

543
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,513
Hey. I get it now.

544
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:40,348
"Who" is the man's <i>name.</i>

545
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,751
Aha, ah!

546
