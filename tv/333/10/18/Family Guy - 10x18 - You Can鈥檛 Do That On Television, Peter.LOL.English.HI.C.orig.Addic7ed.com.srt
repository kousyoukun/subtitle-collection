1
00:00:01,941 --> 00:00:05,309
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:08,693
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

3
00:00:08,778 --> 00:00:12,163
But where are those good old-fashioned values

4
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:15,150
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:18,737
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:21,957
Lucky there's a man who positively can do

7
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:23,558
All the things that make us

8
00:00:23,626 --> 00:00:24,976
Laugh and cry

9
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:29,335
He's... a... Fam... ily... Guy!

来租辆U-Haul大卡车吧
Take it yourself with U-Haul.

16

但我以前都没开过卡车呢
But I've never driven a truck before.

17
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:42,861
好说
ANNOUNCER: <i>No problem.</i>

18
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:45,213
U-Haul能让所有人都能开上大卡车
<i>U-Haul lets anyone drive a giant truck,</i>

19
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:48,650
就算这很危险 因为 嘿 你正在开车呢
<i>even though it's dangerous, because, hey, you're moving.</i>

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,240
抱歉 我正在新城里溜车呢
Sorry, I'm making a go of it in a new city.

21
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:57,442
好了 我们几天后再见了
All right, I'll see you guys in a couple of days.

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,743
你要去哪
Where are you going?

23
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:00,312
我要去给蕾丝边的屁屁拍照呢
I'm off to take pictures of lesbian butts.

24
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,796
什么
What?

25
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:03,915
我和Joe还有Quagmire正在做一本茶几画册
Joe and Quagmire and I are making a coffee table book

26
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:05,950
名叫"80年代牛仔裤下的蕾丝边屁屁"

我第一章都已经做好了 就在这儿
I already got the first chapter right here.

28
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:10,388
你这都是在哪拍的
Where'd you take all these pictures?

29
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:12,540
你懂的 咖啡屋 雪弗兰车店
You know, coffee houses, Chevy dealerships,

30
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:13,925
各种普通的地方
all the usual places.

31
00:01:13,993 --> 00:01:14,926
Peter 你不准去
Peter, you're not doing that.

32
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:16,461
我有一大堆活要干
I got a ton of errands to run,

33
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:18,096
所以我要你帮我分摊点儿
and I need your help around here.

34
00:01:18,164 --> 00:01:19,731
呃 好吧 如果你不让我编书
Well, fine, if I can't do the book

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,266
我就要伤害你心爱的东西
I'm gonna hurt something you love.

36
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:29,040
你现在高兴了
You happy now?

37
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:31,159
也许我们应该在别的房间谈
Maybe we should discuss this in the other room.

38
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:32,761
我不喜欢在孩子面前吵架
I don't like fighting in front of the kids.

39
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:34,562
不 我就要在孩子面前吵
No, I want to fight in front of the kids.

40
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,448
一有观众我就特兴奋
I feed off the excitement of an audience.

41
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:38,049
Peter我就求你一次 你得待在家
Peter, for once you're going to stay here

42
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:39,317
帮我照应下家里
and help around the house.

43
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:41,419
现在 我要你在我回来前帮我照看Stewie
Now, I need you to watch Stewie till I get back.

44
00:01:43,422 --> 00:01:45,623
不管是谁做的 感谢你
Whoever did this, thank you.

45
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:45,623
狗狗最怕吸尘器了

46
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:51,346
好了 Stewie 既然Lois说
All right, Stewie, since Lois says

47
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:52,580
我要照看你
I got to keep an eye on you,

48
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:54,849
我们不妨享受一下父子时光
we might as well have some father-son time,

49
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:56,067
所以我要测量你的小JJ
so I'm gonna measure your penis

50
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:57,736
然后我再测我的
and then I'm gonna measure my penis,

51
00:01:57,803 --> 00:01:59,404
再来看谁的更大一点
and we're gonna see whose is bigger.

52
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:00,572
这貌似不太公平呐
Doesn't really seem fair.

53
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,524
好了 看看你的尺寸如何
All right, let's see what you got.

54
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:04,976
真是个2B游戏
Stupid game anyway.

55
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:06,644
嘿 孩子们 接下来
ANNOUNCER: Hey, kids, coming up next,

57
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:10,098
不不 别换台
No, no, don't switch it.

58
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:10,965
我要看"开心农场"
I want to watch <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

59
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:12,434
马勒个巴子
Son of a bitch.

60
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,969
我得看这无聊的儿童节目一整天了
I got to spend the rest of the day watching stupid kid shows.

61
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:16,654
还不如看油漆干掉
I'd rather watch paint dry.

62
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,000
爽
Nice.

63
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:34,239
起来了 起来了
Wakey, wakey.

64
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,241
早上好 Maggie母亲
ALL: Good morning, Mother Maggie.

65
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:37,642
嘿 这是谁
Heh, who's this?

66
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,777
我喜欢她
I like this lady.

67
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,078
嘿 你觉得Maggie母亲
Hey, do you think Mother Maggie

68
00:02:40,146 --> 00:02:41,346
是不是结婚了 和神父Fa…?
is married to Father Fa...?

69
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:41,346
Father Faber 英赞美诗作家 神学家

70
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:42,830
噢 大概不是的
Oh, probably not.

71
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,182
然后独角兽滑下
MOTHER MAGGIE: And the unicorn slid

72
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:47,035
彩虹来到一片彩红豆田中
down the rainbow to a field of jellybeans

73
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:49,204
它和其他村民们都认为
where she and the other villagers decided

74
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:52,107
那是他们过的最开心的一天
it had been the best day ever.

75
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:54,125
噢 瞧啊 是猪先生Pengrove
Oh, look, it's Pengrove Pig,

76
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:56,661
他很大方的分享苹果给大家 不是么
and he's sharing his apples nicely, isn't he?

77
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,947
真是个大好人
Like a champ he is.

78
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:03,368
头 肩膀 膝盖和脚趾 膝盖和脚趾
Head, shoulders, knees, and toes, knees and toes.

79
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:06,805
这样你就能用燕麦罐子做出一只鸭了
And that's how you make a duck out of an oatmeal container.

80
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:09,808
这真是电视史上最好的节目了
This is the greatest show in the history of television.

81
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,777
maggie母亲 你就是我心心相印的知音啊
Mother Maggie, you are a kindred spirit.

82
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:14,779
这一定就是出生就被分开的双胞胎
This must be how twins who are separated at birth

83
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:16,548
初次见面的感觉
feel when they first meet.

84
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,971
交换钥匙 干对方老婆?
Trade house keys, bang each other's wives?

85
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,873
好呀
Yep.

86
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:32,180
我不能解剖这只猪 Kingman先生
I can't dissect this pig, Mr. Kingman.

87
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:33,648
这和我的信仰相悖
It's against my religion.

88
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:34,449
相信我 Neil
Believe me, Neil,

89
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,618
猪触碰犹太人也是一样没有快感的
it's no thrill for the pig to touch a Jew either.

90
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:38,419
好吧 你怎么样了 Meg 进展如何 
Okay, how about you, Meg, how are you doing?

91
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:39,954
很不错
Pretty good.

92
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:42,891
就是 切割除我以外的东西感觉非常爽
It's, it's kind of cool cutting something that's not me.

93
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,926
哇 你干的真是不错呢
Wow, that's some very impressive work.

94
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:47,862
Meg解剖猪很容易因为她就是只猪
It's easy for Meg to dissect a pig because she is a pig.

95
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:50,348
嘿
Hey!

96
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,983
好了 我先放你一马
All right, I'll let that one slide.

97
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:53,718
Meg 你真的很有天赋
Meg, you have some real potential.

98
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:55,286
你有没有想过成为一名医生
Have you ever thought about becoming a doctor

99
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:56,488
等你长大以后呢
when you grow up?

100
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:58,756
我一直以为我会在码头工作呢
I always just assumed I'd work on the docks.

101
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,158
不要妄自菲薄 Meg
Don't limit yourself, Meg.

102
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:01,926
医生一直都戴着口罩
Doctors wear a mask most of the time,

103
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:03,728
所以这不是问题
so this isn't an issue.

104
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:05,513
如果你有兴趣 学校有一个项目
If you're interested the school has a program

105
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:07,081
你可以跟在一名真正的医生后面
where you can shadow a real doctor

106
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,850
学习更多医疗领域的知识
and learn more about the medical field.

107
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:11,035
耶 哇 我非常愿意去看看
Yeah, wow, I'd love to check that out.

108
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,287
好极了 我会帮你安排好的
Great, I'll set it up.

109
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:13,972
我不知道猪也能当医生
I didn't know a pig could be a doctor.

110
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,073
嘿
Hey!

111
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,141
你得再来几条刚才那种笑话
You get just a few more of those.

112
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:22,185
孩子们 现在我们要
MOTHER MAGGIE:Now, children, we're going

113
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,697
学习谁是带着帽子的
to learn who wears a hat.

114
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:25,650
消防员戴帽子么

115
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:27,285

118
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:31,339

是的 他可以带 我知道的
Yes, he can, I knew that.

120
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:36,044
在家中的你 现在告诉我 还有谁是戴帽子的
Now, you at home, tell me, who else wears a hat?

121
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:37,779
一批正式的马?
A very formal horse?

122
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,280
很好
Very good.

123
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:43,418
如果你运用想象力 就算保龄球也能带帽子
Even a bowling ball can wear a hat if you use your imagination.

124
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:46,454
保龄球戴帽子?
(laughing): A bowling ball wearing a hat?

125
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:48,957
这就是发明高画质的原因啊
This is what high-def was invented for.

126
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:51,125
Peter 你在搞毛呢
Peter, what the hell are you doing?

127
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:52,727
像你说的那样做一个好父亲
Being a good dad like you asked.

128
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,295
我一直在和Stewie一起看"开心农场"
I've been watching <i>Jolly Farm</i> with Stewie

129
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:55,563
这3个小时以来
for the last three hours.

130
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,266
那不是Stewie 那是菠萝
That's not Stewie, that's a pineapple.

131
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,335
天哪 Stewie哪去了
Oh, my God, where is Stewie?

132
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:01,603
不知道 但我肯定他很好
I don't know, but I'm sure he's fine.

133
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,604
Peter 他是个婴儿
Peter, he's a baby.

134
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:04,239
你不能让他独处
You can't leave him alone.

135
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,157
别这样说嘛 有独处的时间可是很不错呢
Come on, it's good to have some alone time.

136
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:08,393
知道么 我在荒岛上独处了一年
You know, I spent a year alone on a desert island

137
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,361
只有一只猴子和我作伴
with nothing but a monkey to keep me company.

138
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:12,964
你得救了 先生 我们会把你带回文明世界的
You're saved, sir, we're going to get you back to civilization.

139
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,766
我们把你的猴子兄弟也一起带上如何
And how about we bring along your monkey pal?

140
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,984
好
Okay.

141
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:17,435
嗯 我们可以教他手语
Yeah, we can teach him sign language

142
00:05:17,503 --> 00:05:18,803
这样他就能告诉我们
and he can tell us stories

143
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:20,638
你们俩在岛上干了些什么事了
about what you two did on the island together.

144
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:23,258
不 不-不 还是 还是不要 不要带猴子了吧
No, n-no, no, no, let's, let's not, let's not bring the monkey.

145
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,793
呃 我鼻子里进了颗花生巧克力豆
Um, I have a peanut M&M up my nose

146
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:28,563
现在进到更里面 我手指已经够不到了
and it's now further up than my finger can reach.

147
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,665
我准备让人接手这件事了
I am ready to farm this out to someone.

148
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,634
噢 Stewie 你在那呢
Oh, Stewie, there you are.

149
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:35,386
Peter 我让你做一件简单的事 照看宝宝
Peter, I asked you to do one simple thing-- watch the baby--

150
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:36,988
你甚至都做不好
and you couldn't even do that.

151
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:38,556
来 Stewie
Come on, Stewie.

152
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:40,558
天 她怎么老是喜欢唠叨
Geez, why's she got to be such a nag?

153
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:42,560
她像是能像Maggie母亲一样就好了
I wish she was more like Mother Maggie.

154
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:45,530
Maggie母亲有一个通知 小伙子和小姑娘们
Mother Maggie has an announcement, lads and lasses.

155
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:47,966
我一直和你们玩耍学习的很开心
I've had such fun playing and learning with you

156
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,735
这么几年来 但是现在
these last few years, but now,

157
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:55,039
就像天下无不散的宴席 我要离开"开心农场"
just as bees must leave the hive, I must leave Jolly Farm--

158
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:57,609
不是你想象的那样  但我得去治疗不孕不育了
not that you asked, but to have fertility treatments--

159
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:01,312
所以这将是我们最后一集"开心农场"了
so this will be our last episode of <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

160
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,580
什么 不要啊
What? No.

161
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:04,482
他们不能砍掉"开心农场"
They can't cancel <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

162
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,200
Peter 这就是个SB的儿童节目
Peter, it's just a stupid kids' show.

163
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:08,002
就是个SB儿童节目?
Just a stupid kids' show?

164
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:10,638
那猪先生Pengrove和棒棒糖Luau呢
What about Pengrove Pig and the Lollipop Luau?

165
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:12,073
我-我不知道
I-I-I don't know.

166
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,408
这样会留下一个空档
This is going to leave a void,

167
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:15,059
必须有人去填补它
and somebody's got to fill it.

168
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:16,194
我觉得你想多了
I think you're overreacting.

169
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:17,595
你不明白 Brian
You don't understand, Brian.

170
00:06:17,663 --> 00:06:19,647
没有了"开心农场"我怎么办呐
What am I supposed to do without <i>Jolly Farm?</i>

171
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:22,583
我就会像没有了坏孩子的意大利妈妈那样
I'll be like an Italian mom without bad kids.

172
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:26,220
嘿嘿嘿 这里这么吵到底是怎么回事儿
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell is all the commotion in here?

173
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,372
我们什么也没干啊
We're not doing anything.

174
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,806
你们竟敢对我放肆?
You getting fresh with me?

175
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:30,875
我已经厌倦保释你们出狱了
I'm tired of bailing both of youse out of prison.

176
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:32,076
我们都在大学里呢
We're both in college

177
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:33,711
而且我们一直都是优秀生
and we consistently make the dean's list.

178
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,013
我要告诉你们爸爸
I'm telling your father.

179
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,114
好啊
Good.

180
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:41,686
我们的食物在哪儿
Where the hell is our food?

181
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:43,187
是啊 爸妈都哪去了
Yeah, where are Mom and Dad?

182
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:44,889
还有那很棒的手指画
And where's that awesome finger painting

183
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:45,857
Stewie今早完成的那张在哪
Stewie did this morning?

184
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:46,891
噢 原来在这儿
Oh, here it is.

185
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:47,992
谢谢你提醒
Thank you for bringing it up.

186
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,360
我本来不准备说呢
I wasn't going to bring it up.

187
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:51,129
呃 怎么回事
Well, what's going on?

188
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,030
你们还没吃饭?
You haven't eaten yet?

189
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:53,031
没呢
No.

190
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,332
你们的爸爸哪去了
Where's your father?

191
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,200
他应该把千层面用烤箱烤好的
He was supposed to put the lasagna in the oven.

192
00:06:56,268 --> 00:06:58,903
我去瑜伽课的时候就让他做这一件事的
I ask him to do one thing while I'm at yoga.

193
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,605
你去了个入门班
You go to an intro class

194
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:02,173
而且还不是在瑜伽房
and it's not even at the yoga studio.

195
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,391
是在某人的客厅
It's in someone's living room.

196
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,926
而且那还不是瑜伽垫
And that's not even a yoga mat.

197
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:07,095
是我小床边上的旧尿垫子
That's the old pee pad from my crib.

198
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,697
呃 Lois 你也许得瞧瞧这个
Uh, Lois, you might want to check this out.

199
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:12,316
- 什么事 Brian? - 你看一下
- What is it, Brian? - Take a look.

200
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:17,238
孩子们 现在是"皮蒂妙趣屋"时间啦
PETER: And now, boys and girls, it's time for <i>Petey's Funhouse.</i>

201
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:17,238
恶搞了儿童节目Pee-Wee's Playhouse的标题

202
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:23,411
这里将妙趣横生 我们将开怀大笑
It's gonna be fun and we'll have lots of yuks

203
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:25,980
也许我们会学到知识但也不是一定
And maybe learn some stuff but not definitely

204
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:29,300
这就是"皮蒂妙趣屋"
It's the <i>Petey's Funhouse</i> show.

205
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:31,936
呃 另一个Aaron Sorkin的节目
Ugh, another Aaron Sorkin show

206
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:31,936
电视电影编剧 写过各种好坏剧本
有《一球成名》 《白宫风云》等

207
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:33,938
真是让人摸不着头脑啊
that's way over everyone's head.

208
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:42,688
你居然还能开办一档电视节目 Peter?
How the hell did you even get a TV show, Peter?

209
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:44,356
我只是回应了一则Craigslist网上广告
I just answered an ad off Craigslist,

210
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:44,356
网上大型免费分类广告网站

211
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:47,292
在几小时的性虐待后 我就有了个节目
and after several hours of sexual torture, I had a show.

212
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:49,428
别接
Don't answer that.

213
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:51,096
我给他们电话是被逼无奈的
I gave out that number under duress.

214
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:53,398
Lois Peter的节目是在当地公共频道上的
Lois, Peter's show is on the local public access channel.

215
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:54,900
每个人都可以有的
Anyone can have one.

216
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,702
是的 "皮蒂妙趣屋"其实是代替了
Yeah, <i>Petey's Funhouse</i> is actually replacing

217
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,904
"烂音频地下室秀"
<i>The Bad Audio Basement Show.</i>

218
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:02,541
只要热胶水一干 你的鸟屋就完成了 
(distorted): And once the hot glue dries, your birdhouse will be complete.

219
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,576
Peter 你在家里已经什么事都没干了
Peter, you already do nothing around the house

220
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:07,012
现在你又要浪费时间胡闹
and now you're wasting more time with this nonsense.

221
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,281
天哪 你怎么还抓着这事不放
Geez, you're still getting on my hump about this?

222
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:10,482
我可做了不少事呢
I help out around here.

223
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,217
就这早上我还给Meg换了尿布
Just this morning I changed Meg's diaper

224
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,652
然后送她去了学校
and I sent her off to school.

225
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,221
哇 她脚上功夫可真厉害 但我还是让她一尘不染才离开
Boy, can she kick, but she left here spotless.

226
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,511
Hartman医生 谢谢你让我做你的跟班
Dr. Hartman, thanks for letting me shadow you.

227
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,680
我就知道我一定能学到很多的
I just know I'm going to learn so much.

228
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:27,049
这是我的荣幸 Meg 你也是个不错的帮手
It's my pleasure, Meg, and you're in good hands.

229
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:28,450
你看见那证书了么
You see that diploma?

230
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:29,952
耶鲁医学院
Yale Medical School.

231
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:31,820
哇 好牛B啊
Wow, that's impressive.

232
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:34,389
谢谢 我在书法上可是下了不少功夫
Thank you, I work very hard on my calligraphy.

233
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:36,992
那么 我们不如在医院里先逛一圈
So, how about we take a little stroll around the hospital?

234
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:39,110
这片区域被叫做走廊
This area is known as a hallway.

235
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:40,462
别担心 你肯定可以掌握
Don't worry, you'll pick up

236
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,948
所有的医师专业术语 不用花多久
on all the technical doctor jargon pretty soon.

237
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:45,884
嘿 应该是处方还是处罚?
Hey, is it prescription or perscription?

238
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,336
我想是处方
I think it's prescription.

239
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,339
处方… 从我嘴里念出来有点怪怪的
Prescription... that just feels weird in my mouth.

240
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:53,058
处罚显然更好
Perscription is better.

241
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,626
噢 这里是E.R.(急救室)
Oh, and there's the E.R.

242
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:57,179
别进去除非你想所有人都对你大喊大叫
Don't go in there unless you want everyone to yell at you.

243
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:06,138
嗨 孩子们 我是 Petey Griffin
Hi, kids, I'm Petey Griffin.

244
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:07,739
嗨 Petey
ALL: Hi, Petey!

245
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:10,325
我们今天的"皮蒂妙趣屋"将会非常有趣哦
We're going to have so much fun on <i>Petey's Funhouse</i> today,

246
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:14,263
但在我们开始之前 你们的朋友Petey想对你们唱一支歌
but before we begin, your friend Petey wants to sing you a song.

247
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:18,016
什么让你如此特别
What makes you so special?

248
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:20,802
因为你就是这样特别
The fact that you are special

249
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,155
但如果所有人都特别
But if everybody's special

250
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:25,874
但这样就有点烂大街了
That kinda waters it down

251
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:25,874


252
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,527
所以你们有些人不特别
So some of you ain't special

253
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:31,280
我可以告诉你们谁是特别的
I can tell you who is special

254
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:33,498
就像你和你不是特别的
Like you and you ain't special.

255
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,300
还有你是 但你不是
And you are and you're not.

256
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:41,306
好了孩子们 现在是"皮蒂妙趣屋"的故事时间了
Okay, kids, it's story time here on <i>Petey's Funhouse.</i>

257
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:44,810
今天的故事是"80年代牛仔裤下的蕾丝边屁屁"
Today's story is <i>Lesbian Butts in '80s Jeans.</i>

258
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,845
哇 这个很经典哟
Ooh, that's a classic.

259
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:50,449
很久很久以前 有一些小妞穿着皮夹克在我面前
Once upon a time, some chick in a leather jacket in front of me

260
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:52,751
从停车场去往家得宝
in the parking lot walked into Home Depot,

261
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:52,751
美国家具连锁店

262
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:55,454
然后她的屁屁看起来就是这样的
and her butt looked like this.

263
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,055
所有人都看见了么
Everybody see this?

264
00:09:57,123 --> 00:09:59,324
都看见这屁屁是如何有型了么
Everybody see how shapeless this is?

265
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:02,828
她从那里出来肩上扛着一袋土
She walked out of there with a bag of soil on each shoulder.

266
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,496
现在在我给你们看下一张之前
Now, before I show you this next one,

267
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:07,883
你们有人听说过斯特吉斯摩托车拉力赛么
has anyone here ever heard of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally?

268
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:12,654
我知道在"皮蒂妙趣屋"我们有很多欢乐
I know we have a lot of yuks here on <i>Petey's Funhouse,</i>

269
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:15,324
但有件事不是那么有趣叫恶霸
but one thing that's not fun is a bully.

270
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:17,926
现在 你们有多少人是被欺负过的
Now, how many of you kids out there have ever gotten bullied?

271
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,162
啊 上来

Well, my name is Winston, and I'm quite fond of ballet.

274
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,471
我曾经效力于少年棒球联盟时
One time I tried out for Little League

275
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:31,974
穿了芭蕾舞鞋 然后其他孩子

278
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:37,546
- 你多大了 - 8岁
- How old were you? - Eight.

279
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:38,780
啊 这么大了
Aah, too old!

280
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:41,116
你这么大了还尿裤子 尿裤子小鬼
Too old to be peeing yourself, Baby Pee Pants.

281
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:42,918
好了 你们接下去搞定他吧
All right, you kids finish him off.

282
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:48,757
嘿 你干嘛呢
Hey, what do you got there?

283
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,392
噢 我正在玩李氏原木
Oh, I'm just playing with some Lee Logs.

284
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,860
李氏原木是什么玩意儿
What the hell are Lee Logs?

285
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:53,528
就是我自创的啦 李氏积木
A little something I created-- Lee Logs.

286
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:54,896
Robert E. Lee.

287
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:54,896
南北战争中北弗吉尼亚同盟军的指挥官

288
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:56,832
你懂的 既然有林肯原木 那就有李氏原木
You know, you got Lincoln Logs, you got Lee Logs.

289
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,767
我还是没明白 你…你能建一栋房子?
I don't get it, can, can you build a house?

290
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:00,102
可以建营房
You can build quarters.

291
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,570
那有人住那么
And people live there?

292
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:03,572
如果你让他们住的话
They live there if you tell 'em to live there.

293
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,474
我还是不太喜欢李氏原木的概念
I don't know if I like the idea of Lee Logs.

294
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,142
恩 他们确实买的不咋滴
Yeah, they're not selling very well.

295
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,910
Peter 吃晚饭了
Peter, dinner!

296
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:10,162
我今晚就不吃了 Lois
No dinner for me tonight, Lois.

297
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,431
我得去为明晚的节目加加班
I have to go work on a bit for tomorrow's show.

298
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,666
如果我能在1分钟内杀掉25只蝴蝶
If I can kill 25 butterflies in a minute,

299
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,768
我就不用给观众展示我的蛋蛋了
I won't have to show the audience my balls.

300
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:18,870
Peter 这已经是连续第四个晚上
Peter, this is the fourth night in a row

301
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:21,039
你抛下我们去搞你那节目了
you've skipped out on us to work on your show.

302
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:23,275
而我又要被清洁厨房
Once again, I'm gonna be stuck cleaning up the kitchen,

303
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:25,811
辅导作业还有给Stewie洗澡缠住了
helping out with homework, and bathing Stewie.

304
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:27,679
知道么 如果我是你就不会这么唠叨了
You know, I'd lay off the nagging if I was you.

305
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:29,047
我现在可是儿童电视明星了
I'm a children's TV star now.

306
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:30,816
我可以得到任何我想要的3岁妹子
I can have any three-year-old girl I want.

307
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:32,384
明白点儿 Lois
Just know that, Lois.

308
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:34,519
Peter 我只是让你完成你的那份分工
Peter, I'm only asking you to do your share.

309
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:35,687
好吧 真是烦人
Well, it's getting on my nerves.

310
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:36,822
就像 现在
Like, right now,

311
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,090
你是我这一生中最烦的人了
you are the most annoying thing in my life,

312
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:40,692
但可能要除了电子请柬之外
with the possible exception of Evite.

313
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,561
这是什么 这是一个网站你可以用来
What's this? It's this Web site you can use

314
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:43,829
邀请大家一起活动
to invite people to stuff.

315
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:45,814
需要是一个很盛大的活动么
Does it have to be a significant event?

316
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:47,299
不 完全不用
No. Not at all!

317
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,767
那 如果你刚收到张请柬
Well, do you just get the invitation,

318
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:50,168
然后是不是就没有了
and that's the end of it?

319
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:52,120
不是 它会一直提醒你的
No, it'll remind you about it constantly!

320
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:54,523
有没有可能我可以量身订做一个
Is there any way I can customize this

321
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,359
用我熟悉的剪贴画来展示我的个性的请柬
to showcase my personality through familiar clip art?

322
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:58,727
当然
Yes!

323
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:00,278
那回复呢
And what about those replying?

324
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:02,164
它们能显出他们的幽默么
Can they demonstrate their sense of humor

325
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:03,565
通过那些搞笑的回复
through hilarious replies?

326
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,034
是 是 是的 你说的一切都是
Yes, yes, yes to everything you're saying!

327
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:08,470
我已经迫不及待要开始啦
I'm so excited to get started!

328
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:10,706
你开始的时候我就从这窗户跳出去
You do that while I jump out this window!

329
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:15,377
电子请柬 告诉你的朋友然后再自尽
ANNOUNCER: <i>Evite. Tell a friend and then kill yourself.</i>

330
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,315
然后当你长大一点儿
And then when you get a little older,

331
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:21,950
事情就来了
stuff will come out.

332
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,220
啊噢
Uh-oh!

333
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:28,073
听起来像是我暴躁的坏邻居回家了
Sounds like my cranky new neighbor just got home.

334
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:29,741
我希望她不要过来
I hope she doesn't come over here

335
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,176
然后给我碎碎念
and give me the business.

336
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:33,478
Peter!

337
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,747
噢 嗨 下垂三八婆
Oh, hi, Saggy Naggy.

338
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,432
别管什么打招呼了
Never mind with "hi!"

339
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,635
听起来某人在这边玩得很欢啊
It sounds like someone's having fun over here!

340
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:42,671
你知道我不喜欢这样
You know I don't like that!

341
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:45,006
嘿 孩子们 来见见下垂三八婆

What can I do for you, Saggy Naggy?

345
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:52,030
你们可以停止玩乐
You can stop having fun!

346
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:54,783
但我们喜欢 不是么 孩子们
But we like fun, don't we, kids?

347

对
AUDIENCE: Yes!

348
00:12:56,135 --> 00:12:57,402
那么 太遗憾了
Well, too bad,

349
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,937
因为你们都要吃掉你们的蔬菜
'cause you're all gonna eat your vegetables,

350
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:01,223
听关于我表亲冗长的故事
listen to long stories about my cousins,

351
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,442
然后帮我叠床单
and help me fold sheets!

352
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:05,677
还有你 你要帮我做家务
And you! You're gonna help around the house,

353
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:06,845
倒垃圾
take out the garbage,

354
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:08,997
然后给Stewie喂奶
and give Stewie his bottle!

355
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:10,732
是 我听到了 他们提到我的名字
Yeah, I heard it. They say my name

356
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,968
在电视上 一直如此呢 蛋定 贱人
on TV all the time; calm down, bitch.

357
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:14,803
给我做晚饭 然后去租《暮光之城》
Make me dinner, and go rent <i>Twilight,</i>

358
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:16,688
然后给我舔水蜜桃
and do mouth stuff on me,

359
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:19,057
尽管我已经一天半没洗澡了
even though it's been a day-and-a-half since I've showered,

360
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,793
而且在此期间我上了好几个公共厕所
and I've used several public bathrooms in the interim!

361
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,229
听起来她还得说好久呢 孩子们
Sounds like this could go on for a while, kids.

362
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:25,380
嘿 下垂三八婆
Hey, Saggy Naggy,

363
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:27,282
我知道什么能让你振作起来

364
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,650
你喜欢馅饼么
Do you like pie?

365
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:30,068
我想是的
I guess.

366
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,987

呃 我觉得她以为

368
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,794
这是个不会用派砸人的街区呢
it was a no-pies-in-the-face kind of neighborhood.

371
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,937
二-广-丙-人 先生?
Mr... Pa-ti-ent?

372
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:50,539
我的姓是Saunders
My last name is Saunders.

373
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:52,524
这个发音很有趣
That's an interesting pronunciation.

374
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,292
这位是Meg 她今天是我的跟班

有一张人体的示意图

379
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:03,502
有点像小抄
Kind of a cheat sheet.

380
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:07,489
现在看着 我正在倾听癌症
Now see, right now, I'm listening for cancer.

381
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:09,774

382
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:11,827
也许 给 你来试试

哇 你的心跳听起来快了点

就是我在健康课上学到的一点东西
It's just stuff I learned in health class.

392

脑袋在你的…
head on your...

395
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:35,767
肩膀上
shoulders.

396
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:35,767

406
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:50,782
我想你得从这儿开始接手了
You're gonna have to take things from here, I guess.

407
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,184
什么 你在说什么啊
What?! What are you talking about?

408
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,402
好了 你现在知道的和我一样多了
Well, you now know about as much as I do

409
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,653
关于这整个医生的事
about this whole doctor thing.

410
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:57,205
但我没经过正规的医疗培训啊
But I have no formal medical training.

411
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:59,274
啊 没问题的 我想架子上的那本书
Ah, you'll be fine. I think that book on the shelf

412
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:01,009
里面基本有你所需的一切了
has most of the stuff in there.

413
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:03,678
还有别忘了那小抄如果你需要帮…
And don't forget the cheat sheet if you need a helping...

414
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,664
助的话
hand.

415
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:11,403
我们真要在这儿买鱼
Are we really buying fish

416
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,805
就在买轮胎的地方么
at the same place we buy tires?

417
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:16,107
而且 "Fazio"是…什-什么
And, w-what... "Fazio"?

418
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:16,107


419
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:18,510
难道是个蓝光播放器的商标?
What, is that a brand of Blu-ray player?

420
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:20,929
Stewie 这件绒线衫真时髦啊
Stewie, this sweatshirt is so sophisticated.

421
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:22,998
看 上面写着纽约
Look, it says New York.

422
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:24,966
人们会以为我是从那来的呢
People will think I'm from there.

423
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,355
把你的手机放起来 我们在葬礼上呢
Put your phone away; we're at a funeral!

424
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:31,957
我了个去
Oh, my God.

425
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:33,391
快看
(laughs) Look!

426
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,126
是下垂三八婆
It's Saggy Naggy.

427
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:36,111
呸
GROUP: Boo!

428
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:37,312
你真坏
You're mean.

429
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,847
我不喜欢你 下垂三八婆
I don't like you, Saggy Naggy.

430
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:40,832
你臭不可当 下垂三八婆
You stink, Saggy Naggy.

431
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,567
天哪 你可真没有礼貌
My goodness, that's a very rude thing

432
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:43,802
当你对某人这么说时
to say to someone.

433
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:45,370
叫别人下垂…
Calling them Saggy...

434
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,156
你妹啊
What the hell?!

435
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,141
年轻人 你以为你在干…
Young man, what do you think you're...

436
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,660
Lois 我刚在电视上看到杰西卡·阿尔芭了
Lois, I just saw Jessica Alba on television.

437
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:07,078
我们有90秒钟时间 开搞吧
We've got 90 seconds; let's go!

438
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,279
Peter 我现在可没心情
Peter, I'm not in the mood!

439
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,781
没关系 我们可以用各种方式来
That's okay. We can do it anyway.

440
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:12,050
Peter 就因为你我在公共场合被殴打了
Peter, I was assaulted in public because of you!

441
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:13,801
天哪 怎么个情况
Oh, my God, what happened?!

442
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:14,969
我来告诉你怎么个情况
I'll tell you what happened.

443
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:17,138
一群孩子在克斯玛攻击了我
A group of kids attacked me at Costmart

444
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,073
因为你在你的节目里恶搞我
because you portrayed me on your show

445
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:20,808
让我成了一个讨厌的布偶八婆
as a raging puppet bitch!

446
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,176
编剧们都是从生活中寻找素材
Writers take from their lives.

447
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:24,379
你就嫁给了一个创作型的 你知道你会有这个风险的
You married a creative type. You knew this was a risk.

448
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:26,080
这又是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

449
00:16:26,148 --> 00:16:28,650
呃 过去一周 你不停地都把我唠叨出翔了
Well, the last few weeks, you've been nagging the hell out of me.

450
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,251
Peter 你以为我喜欢?
Peter, you think I like nagging you?

451
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:32,553
我们中必须得有一个成熟点的
One of us needs to be an adult in this marriage,

452
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:33,988
而且显然不是你
and it's clearly not you.

453
00:16:34,056 --> 00:16:36,291
这是不是因为我刚把床尿湿了
Is this about me wetting the bed just now?

454
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:37,592
Peter 你不明白
Peter, don't you understand

455
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,527
我只是在守护这个家么
that I'm just looking out for this family?

456
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:40,695
而且 我不对你唠叨的话
Besides, without my nagging,

457
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:42,630
你估计都把自己给弄死了
you'd probably get yourself killed.

458
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:45,233
或者上床了 对么 大学兄弟会
Or laid. Right, frat house?

459
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:47,635
对
Yeah!

460
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,538
那些笨蛋们真应该好好学学
(laughs) Those knuckleheads should be studying.

461
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:52,573
好了 告诉你吧 随你的便 Peter 我不管了
Okay, you know what? Fine, Peter, that's it.

462
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:54,242
从现在起 我再也不会唠叨你了
From now on, I'm not nagging you anymore.

463
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,310
你不会了么
You're not?

464
00:16:55,377 --> 00:16:57,011
对 你现在就得靠你自己了
No, you're on your own.

465
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,731
我受够了 我已经完全受够了
I'm done with it. I'm done with all of it!

466
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:02,166
好吧 我现在也许该睡觉了
Well, great, I should probably get some sleep.

467
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:04,369
明天的皮蒂妙趣屋 我们要玩"谁是第一个"游戏
Tomorrow on Petey's Funhouse, we're doing who's on first.

468
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:04,369
是Abbott和Costello创作的一个经典喜剧段子
后常被引用

469
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:05,670
我要来演Costello
I'm gonna play Costello,

470
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:08,306
然后Abbott将有一只活美洲狮扮演
and Abbott is gonna be played by live puma.

471
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,908
Peter 这听起来真是…
Peter, that sounds really d...

472
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,744
知道么 听起来好极了
you know what? Sounds great.

473
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:14,012
玩得愉快
Have fun.

474
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,798
谢了 Lois 晚安
Thanks, Lois. Good night.

475
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:19,934
Lois 别人家也吵架的 对吗
Lois? Other families fight, too, right?

476
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,536
没这么严重
Not this much.

477
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,271
你觉得我们是不是该考虑
Do you think maybe we should think about

478
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,806
- 那个… - 我知道
- getting a... - It is what it is.

479
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:26,841
我们还是等Stewie上大学了再说吧
Let's just get Stewie to college and go from there.

480
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,713
先生 如果你想让我给你检测
Sir, if you're gonna want me to examine

481
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,147
你哪里出了毛病
where you're having an issue,

482
00:17:33,215 --> 00:17:35,616
你必须得比"东东"说的更明确些
you're gonna have to be more specific than "thingee".

483
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:38,019
好吧 不是前面的那个东东
Okay. It's not the front thingee.

484
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:39,804
这里怎么回事
What's going on in here?

485
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:41,306
Hartman医生呢
Where's Dr. Hartman?

486
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,841
他家里出了点急事 我不是真医生
He had a family emergency. I'm not really a doctor

487
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,643
但我一直在顶替他的工作
but I've been sort of filling in for him.

488
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:46,911
你什么
You what?!

489
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:49,314
呃 我希望可以学习医学
Well, I think I want to go into medicine,

490
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:50,815
所以我给Hartman医生做跟班
so I was shadowing Dr. Hartman.

491
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:52,517
我已经学到不少了
I've actually been learning a lot,

492
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:54,319
但他突然就把我一个人留下来了
but then he just left me here!

493
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:55,753
但你不属于这儿
Well, you don't belong here!

494
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:57,855
这是家专业医疗机构
This is a professional medical institution

495
00:17:57,923 --> 00:18:00,124
必须要遵守标准和规范
with standards and regulations to adhere to!

496
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:01,192
但 但是我…
But, but I...

497
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,994
我要要求你离开了
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

498
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:05,129
我很抱歉 我会走的
I'm sorry. I'll go.

499
00:18:10,235 --> 00:18:12,603
我的问题自己解决了
My issue has resolved itself.

500
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,642
别走开哦 孩子们
PETER: And don't go anywhere, kids,

501
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,677
因为接下来 我们要来一些经典喜剧
'cause coming up, we got some classic comedy

502
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,279
由我和美洲狮表演
with me and a puma.

503
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,214
老爸真准备这么干么
Is Dad really gonna do this?

504
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:25,350
我告诉你爸我会对他袖手旁观
I told your father I was gonna leave him alone.

505
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,518
下垂三八婆现在再也不会管他了
Saggy Naggy is keeping out of this.

506
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:28,920
美洲狮准备好了么
Is the puma ready?

507
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:30,588
也许我们应该用
Maybe we should poke him with the

508
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:33,157
"美洲狮准备好了没"棍子戳下它
"is-the-Puma-ready?" stick.

509
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:38,146
上帝 我不能让他这么干
Oh, my god, I can't let him do this!

510
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:40,748
快 孩子们 我们去演播室
Come on, kids! We got to get down to that TV studio!

511
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,400
好 对 就这么踩上我的填色书
Okay, yeah, just step on the coloring book.

512
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:43,334
太好了
That's cool.

513
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:51,075
我在问你 谁是第一个
I'm asking you who's on first?

514
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,531
天哪 Peter
Oh, my God! Peter!

515
00:18:56,598 --> 00:18:57,882
关掉摄像 关掉
Cut the camera! Cut it!

516
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,884
放 "皮蒂学了首长的歌"
Roll a "Petey Learn-A-Long Song"!

517
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:03,738
曲调来自儿歌The Farmer in the Dell

518
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:05,406
肯塔基是个州
PETER:  Kentucky is a state

519
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:07,708
肯塔基是个州
Kentucky is a state

520
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:09,977
那的人全是蠢货
All the people there are dicks

521
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:12,880
肯塔基是个州
Kentucky is a state.

522
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:14,699
噢 他伤的很重 打911
Oh, he's hurt bad. Someone call 911!

523
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:15,900
他血流的太多了
He's bleeding too much!

524
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:17,435
他现在需要关注
He needs attention now!

525
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:17,435


526
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,771
谁来救救他啊 做点什么啊
Somebody help him! Do something!

527
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:21,672
现在她对所有人都在唠叨了
Now she's nagging everyone.

528
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,508
有人有受过医疗训练么
Does anyone have any medical training?!

529
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:25,376
他看上去像颈静脉被咬断了
It looks like his jugular is severed.

530
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,145
我在医院里学到过
I learned this at the hospital.

531
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:29,347
Swanson先生 给我找个急救包
Mr. Swanson, find me a first-aid kit!

532
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:31,282
妈 把那些毛巾给我
Mom, hand me those towels.

533
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,352
事情现在还在我控制之下么
Did I hold on to the ball?

534
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
坚持住 爸
Hang in there, Dad.

535
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:36,854

你能行的 Meg
You can do it, Meg.

537
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,667
加油 Meg 你一定要救他
Come on, Meg. You've got to save him!

538
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:52,720
Peter 你得放手了
(quietly): Peter, you need to let go.

539
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:06,384
L-Lois?

540
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:07,752
噢 Peter 谢天谢地
Oh, Peter, thank God!

541
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,086
你没事了
You're okay.

542
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:11,422
