1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,970
 it seems today
that all you see 

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:08,107
 is violence in movies
and sex on tv 

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,310
 but where are those
good old-fashioned values 

4
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:14,680
 on which we used to rely?

5
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:18,183
 lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,620
 lucky there's a man
who positively can do 

7
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,055
 all the things that make us

8
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:24,490
 laugh and cry

9
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:29,695
 he's... A...
Fam... Ily... Guy!

Announcer: We now return
to <i>muppet babies.</i>

12
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,873
Piggy, I don't think
kermie jr. Is doing so well.

13
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,643
Kill me!
I'm in constant pain!

14
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:45,978
(knocking)

15
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:46,912
Oh, hey, quagmire.

16
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:50,916
Hey, peter, do you mind
if I hang out here a while?

17
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,051
I accidentally made
eye contact

18
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,887
With a transvestite at a bar,
and he followed me home.

19
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,655
You knew what you
were staring at!

20
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,024
Get out of here, you mess!
You were far away!

21
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,092
I didn't know
what you were!

22
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:02,327
You know you want me!
Shut up!
Now go home!

23
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,529
Nobody saw me come here!

24
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:04,530
I said, shut up!

25
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:05,764
(whispers):
Sneak around back.

26
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,166
Oh, sure.
Come on in, quagmire.

27
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,901
Oh, you don't have
to take your shoes off.

28
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,235
Our house sucks.

29
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,438
So, quagmire, if you're
some kind of big ladies' man,

30
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,540
How come I never see you
wearing a necklace?

31
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,508
I, uh... That's
not really my thing.

32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,843
I'll get you one.

33
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,411
Please don't.

34
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,579
(a la vinny):
Hey, come on!

35
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,081
The guy wants
to get you a necklace,

36
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,449
Let him get you a necklace!

37
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:29,955
(insect buzzing)

38
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,924
Ah! Ah!
There's a bee in here!

39
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,058
(screams)

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,027
(both scream)

41
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,361
(harmonized screaming)

42
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,330
Can you take it up here...?

43
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,602
Wow, we sound
amazing together!

44
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,037
I know!
That was incredible!

45
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,039
You know, we should do
something with this.

46
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,074
Yeah, maybe we could open up
a mattress store.

47
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,476
Or we could try singing.

48
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,477
Yeah, singing,
that's good!

49
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,212
Wow, finally,
something in my life

50
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:54,446
That makes me feel special.

51
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,815
I mean, except for when
I had those cow udders.

52
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,717
So, as you can see,
the fiscal projections

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,153
For the fourth quarter make
this thing a slam dunk.

54
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,788
Any questions?

55
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,556
Not about my cow udders.

56
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,792
All right, then, looks like
we got ourselves a deal.

57
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,994
This is cause
for celebration.

58
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,095
(cork popping sound)

59
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,397
(all cheering)

60
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,400
(chuckles) I don't care,
I'm not driving.

61
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,974
Okay, what do you got
for a lyric?

62
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,109
"I put a booger on a
painting at the museum."

63
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,511
Is that... Is
that anything?

64
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:26,612
Maybe, maybe.

65
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,780
All right, I got one.

66
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:32,151
 alyssa milano

67
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,920
 I knew you were gonna be hot

68
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,488
 when you were nine.

69
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,123
How about this?

70
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:42,327
 every food tastes good
with melted cheese 

71
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,764
 I like twins,
unless they're siamese. 

72
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,700
There you go!
Now we're jazzin'.

73
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:55,007
 don't store your condoms
in your billfold 

74
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,610
 those things don't work
if they get dry and old 

75
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,513
 broken rubber...

76
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,150
 broken rubber!

77
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,519
Chris: Guys, I'm trying to do
something up here

78
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,355
That works better
if I don't hear men singing!

79
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,057
Oh, damn,
we're out of paper.

80
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,959
Oh, we'll get some more
down at mort's.

81
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,627
But, quagmire,
we are on fire here!

82
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,863
We're gonna be the best thing
since sliced bread!

83
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,199
I'd like a sandwich,
but I don't feel like eating

84
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,534
Two whole loaves of bread.

85
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,369
Tough (bleep)!

86
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,707
Hey, do you mind
paying for this?

87
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,908
I don't have any cash.

88
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,743
Sure, I'll just put it
on my credit card.

89
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,245
I'm never gonna
pay it back anyway.

90
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:37,149
 'cause I have $30,000
in credit card debt 

91
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,818
 when they call,
I tell them 

92
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,420
 I can't pay it back yet

93
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,521
 credit card debt

94
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,323
 tomorrow I may buy myself

95
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,891
 a dining room set

96
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,192
Or this boba fett!

97
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,361
 credit card debt,
credit card debt 

98
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,562
 credit card debt.

99
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,164
What is that sound?

100
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,000
It's like two mandy patinkins
walked into my store!

101
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,168
Was that you guys singing?

102
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,202
Yeah.

103
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,571
That was beautiful.
And it must be original,

104
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,540
Because I know every song
about money,

105
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,408
And I've never heard
that one before.

106
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,711
Well, it was based
on actual events.

107
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,946
Although, I-I don't have
as cavalier an attitude

108
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,249
Toward my debt
as the song suggests.

109
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,783
I'm-I'm actually
up most nights

110
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,385
With severe
panic attacks.

111
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,354
I-I've taken to
throwing up in the yard

112
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,055
So my wife
won't hear me.

113
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,457
Well, you guys have got
something special

114
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,791
With those harmonies.

115
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,693
They could give me five
years salary, tax free,

116
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,762
And it wouldn't put
a dent in my problem.

117
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,030
You really think
we're good?

118
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:25,964
Oh, yeah.

119
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,032
And I should know.

120
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,300
Back in the 1970s,

121
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:31,570
I used to have my own
record label, mort town.

122
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:35,374
<i>I managed</i>
<i>all the hottest disco acts.</i>

123
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,709
<i>I even managed</i>
<i>earth, wind, fire & pollen</i>

124
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,145
<i>For a little while,</i>
<i>but I had to give it up.</i>

125
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,480
 do you remember

126
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,481
(mort sneezes)

127
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,584
 the 21st night
of September? 

128
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,085
(mort sneezes)

129
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:50,322
Oh! September is
the worst month for pollen!

130
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:50,322
<i>I had it all.</i>

131
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,992
<i>But it soon all came</i>
<i>to a very ugly end.</i>

132
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:53,992
Quagmire:
<i>How come?</i>

133
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:58,297
Mort: <i>I got addicted to olives.</i>
<i>They were everywhere.</i>

134
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,799
<i>It was so easy to get</i>
<i>your hands on them.</i>

135
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,336
<i>By 1975,</i>
<i>the olives had control.</i>

136
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,637
<i>It was awful.</i>

137
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,972
<i>I lost weight,</i>

138
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,841
<i>My hair straightened,</i>
<i>even my voice changed.</i>

139
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:13,111
<i>I didn't recognize the man</i>
<i>I saw in the mirror.</i>

140
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,681
(deep voice): What has happened
to you, mort goldman?

141
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,849
You've hit rock bottom.

142
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,352
I'm lucky to be alive today.

143
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,020
Anyway, you guys got
the talent,

144
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,455
But what you need
is a manager.

145
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,856
Someone with no talent

146
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,925
Who can take a lion's share
of your earnings.

147
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,293
You'd do that for us?

148
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,095
Sure I would.
So, what do you say?

149
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,630
Can I be your manager?

150
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:32,998
You betcha!
All right!

151
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,032
Put her there!

152
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,667
No, I've seen
your prescriptions.

153
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,169
Let's just say
we're doing it.

154
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,137
Well, mort, I hope
I can trust you.

155
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,172
I've been lied to before.

156
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,274
Well, I'm off to work.
Bye, guys! Love you!

157
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:43,275
Love you, too!

158
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,343
Bye! Love you!
Love you, pop!

159
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,610
(all laugh)

160
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,945
Chris:
He bought it!

161
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,013
Stewie:
What an idiot!

162
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,915
Lois: I hate him so much
I'm shaking!

163
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,386
(guitars tuning)

164
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,988
All right, fellas,
open mic at the library.

165
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,657
Your first gig.
Go get 'em!

166
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,493
Hey, do I have time to get
a drink at the water fountain

167
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,628
Where the water does not crest
above the dispenser?

168
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,696
Sure.

169
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,900
(slurping)

170
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,705
I can taste
the previous person's cough.

171
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,207
Fellow cardholders,

172
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,977
Please put your hands together
for griffin and quagmire!

173
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,412
(soft ballad playing)

174
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,051
 I can't poop
in strange places 

175
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,519
 strange places

176
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:31,423
 I can only poop
in my home 

177
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,926
 it's as though
I'm watched by strange faces 

178
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,661
 strange faces

179
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:41,166
 it's why I never roam

180
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,334
Excuse me,
I just want

181
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,503
To grab one of
those newspapers.

182
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,440
Just grab one
and go!

183
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,109
I'm looking for a job, okay?!

184
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:57,349
 I've left stewie alone
with strangers 

185
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,884
 strangers

186
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:03,422
 to satisfy
my fecal needs 

187
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:08,093
 I've put my whole family
in danger 

188
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:12,764
 to poop
before my anus bleeds 

189
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,803
 home bowl, home bowl

190
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:22,274
 you know just what I need

191
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:26,745
 home bowl, home bowl

192
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:30,715
 poop before my anus bleeds.

193
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,453
Aw, everybody left.

194
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,054
Well, this was
a waste of time.

195
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,256
I could have gone hiking
with the girls.

196
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,491
We don't hike.

197
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,893
We just wear tight pants
and get coffee.

198
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,299
Well, I guess no one cares
about our music.

199
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,267
I thought we were
pretty good.

200
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,269
Yeah, I've seen
worse performances.

201
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,639
I was walking home around
8:15 p.M. To my car.

202
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,342
It was very dark, and then
I-I heard the footsteps...

203
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,278
Boo! Get to the sex!

204
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,980
Guys, I got great news!

205
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,582
Oh, what is it, mort?

206
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,517
I put your performance
on jewtube.

207
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,153
The promoters of the new England
music festival saw it,

208
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,521
And they want
to book you!

209
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,089
What?!
Are you kidding me?!

210
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,691
Oh, my god,
you hear that, quagmire?

211
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,025
We're on our way!

212
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,862
We got to celebrate like
girls in their 20s!

213
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,097
(camera clicking, all giggling)

214
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,671
Peter:
Oh, my god, we are so random!

215
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,546
You got booked at
the new England music festival?

216
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,448
Oh, my god, peter,
that's amazing!

217
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,317
I had no idea you and quagmire
could even sing!

218
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,520
Now let this be
a lesson to you kids.

219
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,655
If you randomly stumble
upon an amazing talent,

220
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,224
And then someone important
sees it by wild coincidence,

221
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,560
Great things can happen
without any hard work.

222
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,530
I'm gonna go jump off
the roof and see if I can fly!

223
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,732
That's it, chris,
pursue your dream!

224
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,134
A singer, huh?
You as good as the guys

225
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,036
Who sing "happy birthday"
at macaroni grill?

226
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,170
Oh, don't compare me...

227
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,672
Look, they been doing it
for years.

228
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,375
Imagine, my peter,
the big singing star!

229
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,478
Don't forget about us squares
back at home.

230
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,746
Don't you worry, lois.

231
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,080
No one has stronger marriages

232
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,083
And more well-adjusted kids
than rock stars.

233
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,585
It's working!

234
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,259
What you doing
with that doll?

235
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,594
Oh, hello, vinny.

236
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,163
Rupert and I are just having
a spritzer and some cheese

237
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,364
In advance
of the performance.

238
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,166
I wouldn't do that.
Why not?

239
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,401
You know,
there was a guy

240
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,002
On my old block,
johnny chickstuff.

241
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,238
We called him that because
he used to like to, uh...

242
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,339
Do chick stuff?

243
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,707
Do chick stuff!
Exactly.

244
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,242
Anyway, a bunch of us
got together

245
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,612
And beat him with a grill lid
and windshield wipers,

246
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:43,348
And let's just say, uh, he
don't do chick stuff no more.

247
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,716
'cause of the beatin's?

248
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,618
Yeah. He wasn't
exactly like us,

249
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,386
So we had to
almost kill him.

250
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,455
That sounds terrible.
What happened to him?

251
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,923
I don't know.
Soon thereafter,

252
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,225
A girl in the neighborhood
married a black guy,

253
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,861
So we all kind of turned
our attention to that.

254
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,130
(guitars tuning)

255
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,298
Look at us, quagmire.

256
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,100
We're making music,
living the dream.

257
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,035
And to think,
just last week,

258
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,938
My only creative outlet was
picking hockey fights at work.

259
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,274
Griffin, I need
these shipping reports

260
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,142
Filled out by 5:00 today.

261
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,384
Hey, peter, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

262
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,919
Oh, that's great.
Thank you so much.

263
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:21,920
What's your name, honey?

264
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,154
It's me, lois.

265
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,089
All right,
backstage whore,

266
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,657
Here's the key
to my hotel room.

267
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,093
You can flush the dump
I left in there.
What?!

268
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,494
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

269
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,896
Please welcome
griffin and quagmire!

270
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,164
Peter, we're on!

271
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,767
(crowd cheering)

272
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,869
(playing folk music)

273
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,140
 have you ever put butter
on a pop-tart? 

274
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,576
 it's so frickin' good

275
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,745
 have you ever put butter
on a pop-tart? 

276
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,781
 if you haven't,
then I think you should 

277
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,616
 I was sittin' in the kitchen
one day 

278
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,084
 and I was itchin'
to fill up my belly 

279
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,486
 with the pipin' hot jelly

280
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,121
 of the best damn treat
in the world 

281
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,689
He's talking pop-tarts!

282
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,325
 and I saw a stick of butter
and it almost made me shudder 

283
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,461
 and scream like a baby girl

284
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,530
 I don't want a giant penis
or a rocket trip to venus 

285
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,766
 I don't want
to win the lottery 

286
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:08,933
 I just want to squat
and gobble 

287
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,135
 till I'm dizzy and I wobble

288
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,970
 in a butter, fruit
and dough tart dream 

289
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,139
 so I put butter
on a pop-tart 

290
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,775
 it was so frickin' good

291
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,110
 have you ever put
butter on a pop-tart? 

292
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,780
 if you haven't,
then I think you should 

293
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,548
Everybody come
along with us!

294
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,184
 have you ever put
butter on a... 
crowd: Pop-tart!

295
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,986
 it's so frickin' good
yeah!

296
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,888
 have you ever put
butter on a... 

297
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,456
Crowd: Pop-tart!
 if you haven't

298
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,158
 then I think you should.

299
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,192
Pop-tart!

300
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,394
With butter?!

301
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,530
(crowd cheering)

302
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,201
Hey, you guys were great.

303
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,736
Aw, thanks.
My name's ricky.

304
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,237
I'm with sony records.

305
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,306
Our company's gonna be around
for at least three more weeks,

306
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,208
And we want to sign you.

307
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,844
I'll need to discuss this
with my associate.

308
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,346
I don't know, it-it seems
wrong to just dump mort.

309
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,915
He's our friend.
Doesn't that matter?

310
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,350
Quagmire, you remember I told
you about that dream I drew?

311
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,219
Yeah?
We're halfway there.

312
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,521
I think if we do this,
we'll get the giraffe.

313
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,156
Okay, okay, I'm in.

314
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,224
You got a deal.

315
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,892
Great!
I'm gonna get you on tour.

316
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,762
This is the beginning
of something big.

317
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,197
Great news, guys!

318
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,766
I may have gotten you booked
at a horse's birthday party.

319
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,267
Mort, you're fired.
What?

320
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,269
Sorry, mort, but this is
a cutthroat business.

321
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,271
And we need someone tough
in our corner.

322
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,341
Like indonesian kickboxer
agoos bahnwati.

323
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,510
Come on. Come on.

324
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,345
Come on,
come on.

325
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,047
Disappear, disappear.

326
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,349
Come on. Come on.

327
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,455
Peter, I heard you fired mort.

328
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,890
He's your friend.

329
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,126
He's the one that got you
to where you are today.

330
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,795
Lois, my transcendent talent
got me to where I am.

331
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,297
Peter, I don't like what
success is doing to you.

332
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,533
Yeah, well, I don't like
what time is doing to you.

333
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,802
Droop, droop...
(imitates explosion)

334
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,403
Hey, chris, you ready
with my luggage?

335
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,772
Luggage? For what?

336
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,373
We're going on tour, lois.

337
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,641
Here you go, dad.

338
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,977
I emptied this out so
it'd be easier to carry.

339
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,478
Oh, you're right, it is easier.

340
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,579
Good thinking, son.

341
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,381
All right, see you guys
in two months.

342
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,083
Peter, you can't go away
for two months now.

343
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,718
You'll miss thanksgiving.

344
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,286
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to choose

345
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,155
Between music and family.

346
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,422
If I choose family,

347
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,891
Does it have to
be this family?

348
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,559
Yes, peter, this family.

349
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:15,660
So make your choice.

350
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,629
Very well,
this scavenger hunt

351
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,231
Will provide you
with my answer.

352
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,103
Here it is--
a penny from 1858!

353
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,238
We're getting closer
to our answer.

354
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,408
Wake up, mom!
He chose the music!

355
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,415
(sighs)
you know, quagmire,

356
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,150
I feel kind of bad
leaving the family like this

357
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,919
With thanksgiving coming up.

358
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:44,155
I mean, if I'm not there,
who's gonna carve the turkey?

359
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,192
I don't understand!

360
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,127
 on a tour
of one-night stands 

361
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,963
 my suitcase and guitar
in hand 

362
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:52,997
 and every stop

363
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,099
 is neatly planned
for a poet 

364
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:59,237
 and a one-man band.

365
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:05,710
 everyone from florida
is stupid 

366
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,980
 everyone from
florida is dumb 

367
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,015
 I might not be
the brightest guy 

368
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,851
 but next to them,
my iq's high 

369
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,553
 if they had guitars,
here's how they'd strum 

370
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,558
 why the hell do you brush
your teeth at work? 

371
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,363
 why the hell do you brush
your teeth at work? 

372
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,632
 the bathroom's
full of poop and pee 

373
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,868
 and now you've rubbed
that on your teeth 

374
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,371
 like you're gonna kiss
someone at 3:00. 

375
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,308
 get out of the left lane

376
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,079
 you stupid asian bitch

377
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:45,049
 I don't even know
why you are there. 

378
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,823
 I...

379
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,558
 have become

380
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,426
 comfortably numb.

381
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,264
Okay, mr. Griffin.

382
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,331
Now you've got
your flu shot.

383
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,233
Will you stop
giving him flu shots, man?

384
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,401
We got a show to do!

385
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,204
Ah, quagmire, it's cool,
it's cool.

386
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,440
This is the doctor
that killed michael jackson.

387
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,945
Yesterday, I learned
the difference

388
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,413
Between a train and a boat.

389
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,282
I wrote this song
before that.

390
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,284
 train on the water

391
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,052
 boat on a track

392
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,887
 train on the water

393
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,422
 boat on a track

394
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,892
 my lady took a train
across the atlantic 

395
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:32,030
 I hope it don't sink
like the <i>titanic</i> 

396
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:35,300
 I went to the station,
caught a boat downtown 

397
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:39,137
 I hope it don't fall
off the track and I drown 

398
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,204
Ladies and gentlemen,

399
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,274
The all-five-foot-one
black albino choir!

400
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,909
 train on the water

401
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,744
 boat on a track

402
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,546
 train on the water

403
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,648
 boat on a track.

404
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,218
(guitars strumming)

405
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,222
 this waitress is prettier
than my wife 

406
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:02,427
 I could kill my family
with a knife 

407
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,662
 we'll sail around
the world by ship 

408
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,764
 I'll give my whole wad
as a tip 

409
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:10,601
 but first I'll kill
my family with a knife 

410
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:14,605
 yes, he's gonna kill
his family with a knife 

411
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,742
 irregardless of this waitress,
I will kill them with a knife. 

412
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,177
Hold it, hold it.
Stop the tape!

413
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,312
You gonna fart in this
airtight booth all night?

414
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,313
It wasn't me.

415
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,915
We're the only
two people in here!

416
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,750
Hey, bobby, can you play
back peter's track?

417
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,318
Peter:
 this waitress

418
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,388
 is prettier than my wife...
(loud farting over track)

419
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,927
Ah! Thank god.

420
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,628
Come on, guys, you've
been bickering all ni...

421
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,430
Oh, god!

422
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,366
(muffled): We got the album
covers that peter approved.

423
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,433
Wait, wait, peter,

424
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,602
You approved these
without consulting me?

425
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,371
Don't worry, they're great.

426
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,852
I can be giggity.

427
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,887
I can be goo.

428
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,023
I can be giggity.

429
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,491
I can be goo.

430
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,227
Hey, quagmire, wake up.
I got us twins.

431
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,395
Peter, those are guys.

432
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,363
Hell, yeah,
the winklevoss twins.

433
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,199
(whispering): They have
good ideas we can steal.

434
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,234
Peter, quit
screwing around!

435
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,302
We're about to go on
national television.

436
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:21,205
Now, please welcome
our very special musical guests,

437
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,274
Griffin and quagmire.

438
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,579
Wait, quagmire, you got
something on your face.

439
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,882
Aah! Damn it, peter,
that was my eyebrow!

440
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,050
Let's not make a scene.

441
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,719
We're on tv.

442
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,923
 you never should look
at your mother's boobies 

443
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:42,994
 no matter how big
and round they are 

444
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:47,365
 you'll end up seeing
something you don't wanna 

445
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:51,335
 it's guaranteed to
leave a mental scar 

446
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:55,440
 you never should look
at your daddy's penis 

447
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:59,343
 when he's walking down
the hall on Sunday morn 

448
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:04,215
 an acorn in a nest of twigs,
and underneath two fetal pigs 

449
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:08,419
 it'll make you wish
you weren't even born 

450
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:12,390
 parents are gross,
parents are gross 

451
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:16,194
 parents are gross,
parents are gross... 

452
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,962
Come on, you.
Get out of there.

453
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,297
(music stops)

454
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,032
(grunts)
my pick's in here.

455
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,437
Come on!

456
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,879
Come... Uhp, uhp, it just
skipped right over the strings!

457
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,380
Yup, there it goes again.

458
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,549
I saw it!
I totally saw it!

459
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,252
All right, that's it!

460
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,487
(crowd gasps)

461
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,522
We're done!
Do you hear me? I quit!

462
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,160
Hey, y-your makeup lady
was crying earlier.

463
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,495
Wh-what was that about?

464
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,430
This is my time.

465
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,232
Don't ever (bleep)
talk to me

466
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,534
During my time!

467
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,773
Well, kids,
happy thanksgiving.

468
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,609
I wish dad was here.

469
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,310
Meg, could you zip up your fly?

470
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,146
Th-that's kind of
wafting over here.

471
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,914
(guitar strumming nearby)

472
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,516
Peter:
 I can't poop

473
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,117
 in strange places

474
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,185
Peter?
Dad?

475
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,286
Oh, boy.

476
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,687
Larry, you got
to get out of here.

477
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,122
It's been a great
two months!

478
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,057
Meg, keep painting!

479
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:27,265
 I'm so sorry
that I left my family 

480
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:31,802
 and that I decided to roam.

481
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,538
Peter, what are you doing here?

482
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,840
Me and quagmire kind
of had a falling out.

483
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,608
And after that,
I-I realized I...

484
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,776
Meg, can you please stop

485
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,545
Stuffing your face
for two seconds?

486
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,381
Look, I'm sorry
for being a jerk,

487
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,383
And letting a little fame
go to my head.

488
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,785
I just hope you guys
can forgive me.

489
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,454
Oh, peter.

490
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,223
(moans)

491
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,991
I missed you so much.

492
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,960
Oh, we missed you, too.

493
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,461
But I understand.

494
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,829
You had to go
chase your dream.

495
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,731
And a part of me
is glad you did.

496
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:04,168
But now I'm just happy
that you're home.

497
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,403
Welcome home, dad!

498
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,972
So, did you get a lot of
trim on the road, dad?

499
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,074
Chris, that's inappropriate.

500
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,081
Quagmire:
Hey, you got room for another?

501
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,884
Quagmire?

502
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,686
I thought you were
still out on the road.

503
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,588
I was, but then I thought,

504
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,423
What was simon
without garfunkel?

505
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,225
Wildly successful?

506
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,160
Yeah, but all that success
would mean nothing

507
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,695
If I lost my best friend.

508
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,064
Do you... Do you think
you can forgive me?

509
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,166
Oh, quagmire.

510
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,839
Well, I'm glad to have you back
home for thanksgiving, peter.

511
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,608
And I'm glad to be here.

512
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,776
'cause everyone knows
that life after being famous

513
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,412
Is even better
than it was before.

514
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,514
Let me just grab my
stuff off the bus.

515
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,653
(gunshot, thud)

516
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,291
 I don't want a giant penis
or a rocket trip to venus 

517
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,026
 I don't want
to win the lottery 

518
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,194
 I just wanna squat
and gobble 

519
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,362
 till I'm dizzy and I wobble

520
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,097
 in a butter, fruit
and dough tart dream 

521
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,766
 so I put butter
on a pop-tart 

522
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,135
 it was so frickin' good

523
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,870
 have you ever put
butter on a pop-tart? 

524
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:15,906
 if you haven't,
then I think you should 

525
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,441
Quagmire:
Everybody come along with us!

526
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,210
 have you ever put
butter on a... 

527
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,211
Crowd:
Pop-tart!

528
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,912
 it's so frickin' good

529
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,214
 yeah, have you ever put
butter on a... 

530
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,715
Crowd:
Pop-tart!

531
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,818
 if you haven't,
then I think you should.
