ANNOUNCER: We now return
to <i>Muppet Babies.</i>

13
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:40,311
Piggy, I don't think
Kermie Jr. is doing so well.

14
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:44,149
Kill me!
I'm in constant pain!

15
00:00:44,183 --> 00:00:45,383
(knocking)

16
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:47,585
hey, Quagmire.

17
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,355
Hey, Peter, do you mind
if I hang out here a while?

18
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:51,689
I accidentally made
eye contact

19
00:00:51,724 --> 00:00:54,559
with a transvestite at a bar,
and he followed me home.

20
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:56,161
You knew what you
were staring at!

21
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:58,463
Get out of here, you mess!
You were far away!

22
00:00:58,497 --> 00:00:59,731
I didn't know
what you were!

23
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:01,833
You know you want me!
Shut up! Now go home!

24
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:03,001
Nobody saw me come here!

25
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:04,002
I said, shut up!

26
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:05,196
(whispers):
Sneak around back.

27
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:06,471
Oh, sure.
Come on in, Quagmire.

28
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,306
Oh, you don't have
to take your shoes off.

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,741
Our house sucks.

30
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:11,910
So, Quagmire, if you're
some kind of big ladies' man,

31
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:14,012
how come I never see you
wearing a necklace?

32
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,947
I, uh... that's
not really my thing.

33
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:17,215
I'll get you one.

34
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:18,883
Please don't.

35
00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:20,051
(a la Vinny):
Hey, come on!

36
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:21,619
The guy wants
to get you a necklace,

37
00:01:21,654 --> 00:01:22,887
let him get you a necklace!

38
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:29,360
(insect buzzing)

39
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:31,296
Ah! Ah!
There's a bee in here!

40
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,397
(screams)

41
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,399
(both scream)

42
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,834
(harmonized screaming)

43
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:37,802
Can you take it up here...?

44
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:43,074
Wow, we sound
amazing together!

45
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:44,609
I know!
That was incredible!

46
00:01:44,643 --> 00:01:46,578
You know, we should do
something with this.

47
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:48,646
Yeah, maybe we could open up
a mattress store.

48
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:49,981
Or we could try singing.

49
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:50,982
Yeah, singing,
that's good!

50
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:52,517
Wow, finally,
something in my life

51
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:53,918
that makes me feel special.

52
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:56,254
I mean, except for when
I had those cow udders.

53
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:58,122
So, as you can see,
the fiscal projections

54
00:01:58,157 --> 00:02:00,525
for the fourth quarter make
this thing a slam dunk.

55
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,160
Any questions?

56
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:03,962
Not about my cow udders.

57
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:06,164
All right, then, looks like
we got ourselves a deal.

58
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:08,333
This is cause
for celebration.

59
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:09,400

60
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:11,836
(all cheering)

61
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:14,806
(chuckles) I don't care,
I'm not driving.

62
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:21,312
Okay, what do you got
for a lyric?

63
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:23,615
"I put a booger on a
painting at the museum."

64
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:24,916
Is that... is
that anything?

65
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,984
Maybe, maybe.

66
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:28,152
All right, I got one.

Yeah.

104
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,943
That was beautiful.
And it must be original,

105
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:00,845
because I know every song
about money,

106
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,714
and I've never heard
that one before.

00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:04,949

on actual events.

as the song suggests.

with severe
panic attacks.

112
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:14,692
I-I've taken to
throwing up in the yard

113
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:16,227
so my wife
won't hear me.

114
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:17,762
Well, you guys have got

with those harmonies.

116
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:20,932
They could give me five
years salary, tax free,

117
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:23,001
and it wouldn't put
a dent in my problem.

118
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:24,202
You really think
we're good?

Anyway, you guys got the talent,

is a manager.

147
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:27,398
You'd do that for us?

148
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,233
Sure I would.
So, what do you say?

149
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,868
Can I be your manager?

we're doing it.

Well, Mort, I hope
I can trust you.

155
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:39,510
I've been lied to before.

What an idiot!

162
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:49,053
LOIS: I hate him so much
I'm shaking!

163

(guitars tuning)

164
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:56,127
All right, fellas,
open mic at the library.

165
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:57,862
Your first gig.
Go get 'em!

166
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:00,698
Hey, do I have time to get
a drink at the water fountain

167
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:02,767
where the water does not crest
above the dispenser?

168
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:03,801
Sure.

169
00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:07,972
(slurping)

170
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:12,844
I can taste
the previous person's cough.

171
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:14,245
Fellow cardholders,

172
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,049
please put your hands together
for Griffin and Quagmire!

Well, this was
a waste of time.

195
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,261
I could have gone hiking
with the girls.

196
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:38,429
We don't hike.

197
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:40,932
We just wear tight pants
and get coffee.

198
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:46,504
Well, I guess no one cares
about our music.

199
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:48,239
I thought we were
pretty good.

200
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:50,274
Yeah, I've seen
worse performances.

201
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:53,778
I was walking home around
8:15 p.m. to my car.

202
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:56,547
It was very dark, and then
I-I heard the footsteps...

203
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:59,250
Boo! Get to the sex!

204
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:00,952
Guys, I got great news!

205
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:02,420
Oh, what is it, Mort?

206
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,622
I put your performance
on JewTube.

207
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:07,124
The promoters of the New England
Music Festival saw it,

208
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,626
and they want
to book you!

209
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,061
What?!
Are you kidding me?!

210
00:08:10,095 --> 00:08:11,729
Oh, my God,
you hear that, Quagmire?

211
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:12,997
We're on our way!

212
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:15,866
We got to celebrate like
girls in their 20s!

213
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:18,035
(camera clicking, all giggling)

214
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:25,476
PETER:
Oh, my God, we are so random!

215
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:32,485
You got booked at
the New England Music Festival?

216
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,420
Oh, my God, Peter,
that's amazing!

217
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:37,290
I had no idea you and Quagmire
could even sing!

218
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:39,459
Now let this be
a lesson to you kids.

219
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:41,594
If you randomly stumble
upon an amazing talent,

220
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:44,264
and then someone important
sees it by wild coincidence,

221
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:46,532
great things can happen
without any hard work.

222
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,502
I'm gonna go jump off
the roof and see if I can fly!

223
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:51,638
That's it, Chris,
pursue your dream!

224
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:53,973
A singer, huh?
You as good as the guys

225
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:56,075
who sing "Happy Birthday"
at Macaroni Grill?

226
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,210
Oh, don't compare me...

227
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:58,605
Look, they been doing it
for years.

228
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:01,281
Imagine, my Peter,
the big singing star!

229
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:04,384
Don't forget about us squares
back at home.

230
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,585
Don't you worry, Lois.

231
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:07,086
No one has stronger marriages

232
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:09,856
and more well-adjusted kids
an rock stars.

233
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,424
It's working!

234
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:19,198
What you doing
with that doll?

235
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:20,500
Oh, hello, Vinny.

236
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,902
Rupert and I are just having
a spritzer and some cheese

237
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:24,304
in advance
of the performance.

238
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:25,905
I wouldn't do that.
Why not?

239
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,340
You know,
there was a guy

240
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:28,775
on my old block,
Johnny Chickstuff.

241
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,177
We called him that because
he used to like to, uh...

242
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:32,278
Do chick stuff?

243
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:33,579
Do chick stuff!
Exactly.

244
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,214
Anyway, a bunch of us
got together

245
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:38,484
and beat him with a grill lid
and windshield wipers,

246
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,254
and let's just say, uh, he
don't do chick stuff no more.

247
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:42,588
'Cause of the beatin's?

248
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,524
Yeah. He wasn't
exactly like us,

249
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:46,292
so we had to
almost kill him.

250
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:48,394
That sounds terrible.
What happened to him?

251
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:49,762
I don't know.
Soon thereafter,

252
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,998
a girl in the neighborhood
married a black guy,

253
00:09:52,032 --> 00:09:54,701
so we all kind of turned
our attention to that.

254
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,903
(guitars tuning)

255
00:09:56,937 --> 00:09:58,237
Look at us, Quagmire.

256
00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:00,073
We're making music,
living the dream.

257
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:01,841
And to think,
just last week,

258
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,777
my only creative outlet was
picking hockey fights at work.

259
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,013
Griffin, I need
these shipping reports

260
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:08,881
filled out by 5:00 today.

261
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:17,323
Hey, Peter, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

262
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:18,758
Oh, that's great.
Thank you so much.

263
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:19,759
What's your name, honey?

264
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:20,960
It's me, Lois.

265
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:22,061
All right,
backstage whore,

266
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:23,563
here's the key
to my hotel room.

267
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:25,577
You can flush the dump
I left in there.

268
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:26,095
What?!

269
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,400

Hey, you guys were great.

304
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:42,575
Aw, thanks.
My name's Ricky.

305
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:43,976
I'm with Sony Records.

306
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:46,212
Our company's gonna be around
for at least three more weeks,

307
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:48,147
and we want to sign you.

308
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:50,650
I'll need to discuss this
with my associate.

309
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:53,052
I don't know, it-it seems
wrong to just dump Mort.

310
00:11:53,086 --> 00:11:54,720
He's our friend.
Doesn't that matter?

311
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,056
Quagmire, you remember I told
you about that dream I drew?

312
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,091
Yeah?
We're halfway there.

313
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:01,294
I think if we do this,
we'll get the giraffe.

314
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:02,795
Okay, okay, I'm in.

315
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,896
You got a deal.

316
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,598
Great!
I'm gonna get you on tour.

317
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:08,501
This is the beginning
of something big.

318
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:09,869
Great news, guys!

319
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,505
I may have gotten you booked
at a horse's birthday party.

320
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:14,106
Mort, you're fired.
What?

321
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:16,142
Sorry, Mort, but this is
a cutthroat business.

322
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:18,110
And we need someone tough
in our corner.

323
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:21,147
Like Indonesian kickboxer
Agoos Bahnwati.

324
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:23,316
Come on. Come on.

325
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,951
Come on,
come on.

326
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:26,719
Disappear, disappear.

327
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,955
Come on. Come on.

328
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:35,261
Peter, I heard you fired Mort.

329
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:36,596
He's your friend.

330
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,798
He's the one that got you
to where you are today.

331
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:41,567
Lois, my transcendent talent
got me to where I am.

332
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:44,170
Peter, I don't like what
success is doing to you.

333
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:46,339
Yeah, well, I don't like
what time is doing to you.

334
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:48,574
Droop, droop...
(imitates explosion)

335
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:50,243
Hey, Chris, you ready
with my luggage?

336
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:51,544
Luggage? For what?

337
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:53,179
We're going on tour, Lois.

338
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:54,447
Here you go, Dad.

339
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,682
I emptied this out so
it'd be easier to carry.

340
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:58,284
Oh, you're right, it is easier.

341
00:12:58,318 --> 00:12:59,318
Good thinking, son.

342
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:00,920
All right, see you guys
in two months.

343
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:02,688
Peter, you can't go away
for two months now.

344
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:04,423
You'll miss Thanksgiving.

345
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,058
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to choose

346
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:07,760
between music and family.

347
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:08,961
If I choose family,

348
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,563
does it have to
be this family?

349
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:12,298
Yes, Peter, this family.

350
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:13,366
So make your choice.

351
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,334
Very well,
this scavenger hunt

352
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,803
will provide you
with my answer.

353
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,742
Here it is--
a penny from 1858!

354
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,810
We're getting closer
to our answer.

355
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,947
Wake up, Mom!
He chose the music!

356
00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:33,856
(sighs)
You know, Quagmire,

357
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,658
I feel kind of bad
leaving the family like this

358
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:37,226
with Thanksgiving coming up.

359
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:40,429
I mean, if I'm not there,
who's gonna carve the turkey?

360
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:43,499
I don't understand!

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,921
(guitar strumming nearby)

473
00:19:05,956 --> 00:19:07,423
PETER:
♪ I can't poop

474
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:09,091
♪ In strange places

475
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,159
Peter?
Dad?

476
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:11,193
Oh, boy.

477
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,728
Larry, you got
to get out of here.

478
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:14,063
It's been a great
two months!

479
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:15,998
Meg, keep painting!

480
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:23,205
♪ I'm so sorry
that I left my family ♪

481
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:27,810
♪ And that I decided to roam.

482
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:29,612
Peter, what are you doing here?

483
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,847
Me and Quagmire kind
of had a falling out.

484
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:33,682
And after that,
I-I realized I...

485
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:34,817
Meg, can you please stop

486
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:36,385
stuffing your face
for two seconds?

487
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:39,321
Look, I'm sorry
for being a jerk,

488
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:41,490
and letting a little fame
go to my head.

489
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:43,826
I just hope you guys
can forgive me.

490
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,328
Oh, Peter.

491
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:48,163
(moans)

492
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:49,965
I missed you so much.

493
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,934
Oh, we missed you, too.

494
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:53,335
But I understand.

495
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,870
You had to go
chase your dream.

496
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:56,772
And a part of me
is glad you did.

497
00:19:56,806 --> 00:20:00,142
But now I'm just happy
that you're home.

498
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:01,343
Welcome home, Dad!

499
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:03,979
So, did you get a lot of
trim on the road, Dad?

500
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:06,015
Chris, that's inappropriate.

501
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,022
QUAGMIRE:
Hey, you got room for another?

502
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:15,924
Quagmire?

503
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,760
I thought you were
still out on the road.

504
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:19,495
I was, but then I thought,

505
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:21,563
what was Simon
without Garfunkel?

506
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:23,198
Wildly successful?

507
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,100
Yeah, but all that success
would mean nothing

508
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:26,735
if I lost my best friend.

509
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,038
Do you... do you think
you can forgive me?

510
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:31,106
Oh, Quagmire.

511
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:37,880
Well, I'm glad to have you back
home for Thanksgiving, Peter.

512
00:20:37,914 --> 00:20:39,515
And I'm glad to be here.

513
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:41,817
'Cause everyone knows
that life after being famous

514
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,353
is even better
than it was before.

515
00:20:44,387 --> 00:20:45,818
Let me just grab my
stuff off the bus.

516
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:49,763
