00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,670


12
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:37,006
We now return
to <i>Muppet Babies.</i>

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,309
Piggy, I don't think
Kermie Jr. is doing so well.

14
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:44,147
Kill me!
I'm in constant pain!

15
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,583
hey, Quagmire.

16
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:50,353
Hey, Peter, do you mind
if I hang out here a while?

17
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:51,687
I accidentally made
eye contact

18
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:54,557
with a transvestite at a bar,
and he followed me home.

19
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:56,159
You knew what you
were staring at!

20
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:58,461
Get out of here, you mess!
You were far away!

21
00:00:58,495 --> 00:00:59,729
I didn't know
what you were!

22
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:01,831
You know you want me!
Shut up! Now go home!

23
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:02,999
Nobody saw me come here!

24
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,000
I said, shut up!

25
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:05,194
Sneak around back.

26
00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:06,469
Oh, sure.
Come on in, Quagmire.

27
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:08,304
Oh, you don't have
to take your shoes off.

28
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:09,739
Our house sucks.

29
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:11,908
So, Quagmire, if you're
some kind of big ladies' man,

30
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:14,010
how come I never see you
wearing a necklace?

31
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:15,945
I, uh... that's
not really my thing.

32
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:17,213
I'll get you one.

33
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:18,881
Please don't.

34
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,049
Hey, come on!

35
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,617
The guy wants
to get you a necklace,

36
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:22,885
let him get you a necklace!

37
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:31,294
Ah! Ah!
There's a bee in here!

38
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,800
Can you take it up here...?

39
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:43,072
Wow, we sound
amazing together!

40
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:44,607
I know!
That was incredible!

41
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:46,576
You know, we should do
something with this.

42
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,644
Yeah, maybe we could open up
a mattress store.

43
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:49,979
Or we could try singing.

44
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:50,980
Yeah, singing,
that's good!

45
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:52,515
Wow, finally,
something in my life

46
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:53,916
that makes me feel special.

47
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:56,252
I mean, except for when
I had those cow udders.

48
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:58,120
So, as you can see,
the fiscal projections

49
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:00,523
for the fourth quarter make
this thing a slam dunk.

50
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:02,158
Any questions?

51
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:03,960
Not about my cow udders.

52
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:06,162
All right, then, looks like
we got ourselves a deal.

53
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:08,331
This is cause
for celebration.

54
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:14,804
I don't care,
I'm not driving.

55
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:21,310
Okay, what do you got
for a lyric?

56
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:23,613
"I put a booger on a
painting at the museum."

57
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:24,914
Is that... is
that anything?

58
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:25,982
Maybe, maybe.

59
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:28,150

00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:09,725
that works better
if I don't hear men singing!

Oh, damn,
we're out of paper.

75
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:14,931

we are on fire here!

What is that sound?

94
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,270
It's like two Mandy Patinkins
walked into my store!

95
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:55,571
Was that you guys singing?

96
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:56,639
Yeah.

97
00:03:56,673 --> 00:03:58,941
That was beautiful.
And it must be original,

98
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:00,843
because I know every song
about money,

99
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:02,712
and I've never heard
that one before.

100
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,947
Well, it was based
on actual events.

101
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:07,149
Although, I-I don't have
as cavalier an attitude

toward my debt
as the song suggests.

103
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:11,053
I'm-I'm actually

with severe
panic attacks.

105
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:14,690
I-I've taken to
throwing up in the yard

106
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:16,225
so my wife
won't hear me.

107
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,760
Well, you guys have got
something special

108
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:19,028
with those harmonies.

109
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:20,930
They could give me five
years salary, tax free,

110
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:22,999
and it wouldn't put
a dent in my problem.

111
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,200
You really think
we're good?

00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:26,235
And I should know.

Back in the 1970s,

115
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:30,840
I used to have my own

What has happened
to you, Mort Goldman?

132
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:17,053
You've hit rock bottom.

133
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,422
I'm lucky to be alive today.

134
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,157
Anyway, you guys got the talent,

135
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,725
but what you need
is a manager.

136
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,026
Someone with no talent

137
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:26,062
who can take a lion's share
of your earnings.

138
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:27,396
You'd do that for us?

139
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,231
Sure I would.
So, what do you say?

140
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,866
Can I be your manager?

141
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:32,168
You betcha!
All right!

142
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:33,169
Put her there!

143
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:34,870
No, I've seen
your prescriptions.

144
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:36,505
Let's just say
we're doing it.

145
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,240
Well, Mort, I hope
I can trust you.

146
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:39,508
I've been lied to before.

147
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:41,377
Well, I'm off to work.
Bye, guys! Love you!

148
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,378
Love you, too!

149
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:43,612
Bye! Love you!
Love you, Pop!

150
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:46,115
He bought it!

151
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:47,183
What an idiot!

152
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:49,051
I hate him so much
I'm shaking!

153
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:56,125
All right, fellas,
open mic at the library.

154
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,860
Your first gig.
Go get 'em!

155
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:00,696
Hey, do I have time to get
a drink at the water fountain

156
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,765
where the water does not crest
above the dispenser?

157
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:03,799
Sure.

158
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:12,842
I can taste
the previous person's cough.

00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:43,472
to grab one of
those newspapers.

169
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,643
Just grab one
and go!

170

Aw, everybody left.

181
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:35,057
Well, this was
a waste of time.

182
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:37,259
I could have gone hiking
with the girls.

183
00:07:37,294 --> 00:07:38,427
We don't hike.

184
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:40,930
We just wear tight pants
and get coffee.

185
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,502
Well, I guess no one cares
about our music.

186
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:48,237
I thought we were
pretty good.

187
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:50,272
Yeah, I've seen
worse performances.

188
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:53,776
I was walking home around
8:15 p.m. to my car.

189
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,545
It was very dark, and then
I-I heard the footsteps...

190
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,248
Boo! Get to the sex!

191
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:00,950
Guys, I got great news!

192
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:02,418
Oh, what is it, Mort?

193
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:04,620
I put your performance
on JewTube.

194
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:07,122
The promoters of the New England
Music Festival saw it,

195
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:08,624
and they want
to book you!

196
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:10,059
What?!
Are you kidding me?!

197
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:11,727
Oh, my God,
you hear that, Quagmire?

198
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:12,995
We're on our way!

199
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,864
We got to celebrate like
girls in their 20s!

200
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:25,474
Oh, my God, we are so random!

201
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:32,483
You got booked at
the New England Music Festival?

202
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:34,418
Oh, my God, Peter,
that's amazing!

203
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:37,288
I had no idea you and Quagmire
could even sing!

204
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:39,457
Now let this be
a lesson to you kids.

205
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:41,592
If you randomly stumble
upon an amazing talent,

206
00:08:41,627 --> 00:08:44,262
and then someone important
sees it by wild coincidence,

207
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:46,530
great things can happen
without any hard work.

208
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:49,500
I'm gonna go jump off
the roof and see if I can fly!

209
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:51,636
That's it, Chris,
pursue your dream!

210
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,971
A singer, huh?
You as good as the guys

211
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:56,073
who sing "Happy Birthday"
at Macaroni Grill?

212
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:57,208
Oh, don't compare me...

213
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:58,603
Look, they been doing it
for years.

214
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,279
Imagine, my Peter,
the big singing star!

215
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:04,382
Don't forget about us squares
back at home.

216
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,583
Don't you worry, Lois.

217
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:07,084
No one has stronger marriages

218
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:09,854
and more well-adjusted kids
an rock stars.

219
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:11,422
It's working!

220
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:19,196
What you doing
with that doll?

221
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,498
Oh, hello, Vinny.

222
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:22,900
Rupert and I are just having
a spritzer and some cheese

223
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,302
in advance
of the performance.

224
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:25,903
I wouldn't do that.
Why not?

225
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:27,338
You know,
there was a guy

226
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:28,773
on my old block,
Johnny Chickstuff.

227
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:31,175
We called him that because
he used to like to, uh...

228
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:32,276
Do chick stuff?

229
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:33,577
Do chick stuff!
Exactly.

230
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:35,212
Anyway, a bunch of us
got together

231
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:38,482
and beat him with a grill lid
and windshield wipers,

232
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:41,252
and let's just say, uh, he
don't do chick stuff no more.

233
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:42,586
'Cause of the beatin's?

234
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:44,522
Yeah. He wasn't
exactly like us,

235
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:46,290
so we had to
almost kill him.

236
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:48,392
That sounds terrible.
What happened to him?

237
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:49,760
I don't know.
Soon thereafter,

238
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:51,996
a girl in the neighborhood
married a black guy,

239
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,699
so we all kind of turned
our attention to that.

240
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:58,235
Look at us, Quagmire.

241
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,071
We're making music,
living the dream.

242
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:01,839
And to think,
just last week,

243
00:10:01,873 --> 00:10:04,775
my only creative outlet was
picking hockey fights at work.

244
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,011
Griffin, I need
these shipping reports

245
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:08,879
filled out by 5:00 today.

246
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:17,321
Hey, Peter, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

247
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:18,756
Oh, that's great.
Thank you so much.

248
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,757
What's your name, honey?

249
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,958
It's me, Lois.

250
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:22,059
All right,
backstage whore,

251
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:23,561
here's the key
to my hotel room.

252
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:25,575
You can flush the dump
I left in there.

253
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:26,093
What?!

254
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:27,398
Ladies and gentlemen,

255
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:29,734

Griffin and Quagmire!

256

285
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:41,138
Hey, you guys were great.

286
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:42,573
Aw, thanks.
My name's Ricky.

287
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:43,974
I'm with Sony Records.

288
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,210
Our company's gonna be around
for at least three more weeks,

289
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:48,145
and we want to sign you.

290
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,648
I'll need to discuss this
with my associate.

291
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:53,050
I don't know, it-it seems
wrong to just dump Mort.

292
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:54,718
He's our friend.
Doesn't that matter?

293
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:57,054
Quagmire, you remember I told
you about that dream I drew?

294
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:59,089
Yeah?
We're halfway there.

295
00:11:59,124 --> 00:12:01,292
I think if we do this,
we'll get the giraffe.

296
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:02,793
Okay, okay, I'm in.

297
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:03,894
You got a deal.

298
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,596
Great!
I'm gonna get you on tour.

299
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,499
This is the beginning
of something big.

300
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:09,867
Great news, guys!

301
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,503
I may have gotten you booked
at a horse's birthday party.

302
00:12:12,537 --> 00:12:14,104
Mort, you're fired.
What?

303
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,140
Sorry, Mort, but this is
a cutthroat business.

304
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:18,108
And we need someone tough
in our corner.

305
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:21,145
Like Indonesian kickboxer
Agoos Bahnwati.

306
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:23,314
Come on. Come on.

307
00:12:23,348 --> 00:12:24,949
Come on,
come on.

308
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,717
Disappear, disappear.

309
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,953
Come on. Come on.

310
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:35,259
Peter, I heard you fired Mort.

311
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:36,594
He's your friend.

312
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:38,796
He's the one that got you
to where you are today.

313
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,565
Lois, my transcendent talent
got me to where I am.

314
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,168
Peter, I don't like what
success is doing to you.

315
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:46,337
Yeah, well, I don't like
what time is doing to you.

316
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:48,572
Droop, droop...

317
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:50,241
Hey, Chris, you ready
with my luggage?

318
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:51,542
Luggage? For what?

319
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:53,177
We're going on tour, Lois.

320
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:54,445
Here you go, Dad.

321
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,680
I emptied this out so
it'd be easier to carry.

322
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:58,282
Oh, you're right, it is easier.

323
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,316
Good thinking, son.

324
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:00,918
All right, see you guys
in two months.

325
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:02,686
Peter, you can't go away
for two months now.

326
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:04,421
You'll miss Thanksgiving.

327
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:06,056
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to choose

328
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:07,758
between music and family.

329
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:08,959
If I choose family,

330
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:10,561
does it have to
be this family?

331
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:12,296
Yes, Peter, this family.

332
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,364
So make your choice.

333
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:15,332
Very well,
this scavenger hunt

334
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:17,801
will provide you
with my answer.

335
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:22,740
Here it is--
a penny from 1858!

336
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:24,808
We're getting closer
to our answer.

337
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:27,945
Wake up, Mom!
He chose the music!

338
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,854
You know, Quagmire,

339
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:35,656
I feel kind of bad
leaving the family like this

340
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,224

341
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,427

00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,770
And a part of me
is glad you did.

474
00:19:56,804 --> 00:20:00,140
But now I'm just happy
that you're home.

475
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:01,341
Welcome home, Dad!

476
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:03,977
So, did you get a lot of
trim on the road, Dad?

477
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:06,013
Chris, that's inappropriate.

478
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:13,020
Hey, you got room for another?

479
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:15,922
Quagmire?

480
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:17,758
I thought you were
still out on the road.

481
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,493
I was, but then I thought,

482
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:21,561
what was Simon
without Garfunkel?

483
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,196
Wildly successful?

484
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:25,098
Yeah, but all that success
would mean nothing

485
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,733
if I lost my best friend.

486
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,036
Do you... do you think
you can forgive me?

487
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,104
Oh, Quagmire.

488
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:37,878
Well, I'm glad to have you back
home for Thanksgiving, Peter.

489
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:39,513
And I'm glad to be here.

490
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:41,815
'Cause everyone knows
that life after being famous

491
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:44,351
is even better
than it was before.

492
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:45,816
Let me just grab my
stuff off the bus.

493
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:50,961
