00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,280
Peter, come on,
get dressed.

13
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:37,614
We're late
for church.

14
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,249
I don't want to
go to church.

15
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:41,819
I always feel like that
priest has it in for me.

16
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:43,821
Body of Christ.

17
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:45,823
Body of Christ.

18
00:00:45,857 --> 00:00:47,091
Butt of Christ.

19
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,326
Aah! Lois, trade me.
No.

20
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:52,629
You're not wearing that
to church, are you?

21
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:53,997
What? Yeah. Why not?

22
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:55,532
This is what
I always wear.

23
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:56,767
She's right, man.

24
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:57,935
It's Sunday. Get noticed.

25
00:00:57,969 --> 00:00:59,970
I'll be in the car.

26
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:03,874
I'm getting tired of you wearing
the same thing every day.

27
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:05,742
Look, that shirt's got
a hole in it.

28
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:08,612
I'd like to point out that Jesus
wore the same thing every day.

29
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:11,115
And you didn't hear Alice
giving him a hard time about it.

30
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:12,416
Who?
Wasn't that her name?

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,617
Let's just get to church.

32
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:15,119
And afterward,
you're going to the mall

33
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:16,286
to go clothes shopping.

34
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,721
Well, you're
coming with me.

35
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:20,157
Last time I tried shopping
without you, it was a disaster.

36
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,525
Hey, I'm home.

37
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,494
I got groceries.
You what?

38
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:24,801
Yeah, I was driving past there,

39
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:26,663
and we were out
of some stuff, so I...

40
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:28,832
You listen to me,
you son of a bitch!

41
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,801
I've got one thing
in this lifetime!

42
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:32,603
One thing.
(groaning)

43
00:01:32,637 --> 00:01:35,606
You always say I never
do anything around here.

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,942
Yeah, I like saying that more
than I like you doing things.

45
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:41,178
Dad, I got the rest
from the car. Where...?

46
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:42,579
Chris, run!
You were right!

47
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:43,747
She didn't appreciate it!

48
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:45,949
Oh, crap!

49
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,684
CHRIS:
Ow!

50
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,019
That's right.

51
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:50,687
I do groceries.

52
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,361
All right, even though
we just walked in,

53
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:00,297
and this whole place is one
hallway, let's consult the map.

54
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,965
Okay.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,233
Uh-oh.

56
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:05,435
(gunshot)

57
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:11,108
I'll bet we can find you
some new clothes in here.

58
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:13,777
PETER: Hey, Lois, are you sure
this place is for men?

59
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:15,179
Yes, Peter, it's for everyone.

60
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:17,481
Really? 'Cause this-this
kind of looks like a dress.

61
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:19,650
Peter, it's fine.
Come on out.

62
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:22,753
Ha! You gaybo!

63
00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:26,557
Hang on, Peter.

64
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:29,026
I'm gonna go look for a couple
things for me in here.

65
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,194
I'll be right back.

66
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:31,595
Okay, Lois, I'll
be right here,

67
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:34,231
standing uncomfortably close to
the unnecessary piano player

68
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:35,999
in the middle of the mall.

69
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:37,734
♪

70
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,870
So, what's it like
now that you've made it?

71
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:41,305
Did you ever have
a bank account

72
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:43,040
full of pedestrians'
disinterested smiles?

73
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:44,474
You're amazing.

74
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:47,077
I'm gonna sit Indian-style
on top of your piano.

75
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,148
There aren't enough verses
in any song I could write

76
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:54,017
that would express how much
hatred I have in my heart.

77
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:56,253
You talk like a book.

78
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:59,189
Hey, Lois,
how about we try Sears?

79
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:00,357
They got good stuff.

80
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:01,892
Peter, nobody's been
in Sears for decades.

81
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:03,627
Oh, come on.
When I was a boy,

82
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:05,502
we always used to go
clothes shopping at Sears.

83
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,197
Trust me. They'll have
everything I need.

84
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:14,037
What the hell happened here?

85
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:15,372
Look out!

86
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,643
(muffled speaking)

87
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,712
He wants to know
who you are.

88
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:24,147
We seek clothes
for the cold times.

89
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:26,149
(muffled speaking)

90
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:29,119
He says he'll take you to
the clothes for herbs and meat.

91
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:30,621
Well, we can probably come up

92
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:32,556
with some herbs
and meat, right, Peter?

93
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,991
Peter?

94
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:35,459
I'm with them now.

95
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:36,860
No girls allowed.

96
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:39,296
(tires squealing)

97
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:45,269
See, Lois, now,
this is more like it.

98
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:47,304
What the hell?
Why won't this button?

99
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:49,006
It's the same size
I always get.

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,941
Maybe you put on a
few pounds, sweetie.

101
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,143
Lois, I weigh the same
293 pounds today

102
00:03:53,177 --> 00:03:54,444
that I weighed
in grade school.

103
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,114
Perhaps it's this lump
on the side of your neck, sir.

104
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:58,582
Oh, my God, Peter!

105
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:00,384
How long have you
had that thing?

106
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:01,551
I-I don't know.

107
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:03,654
We got to go see
Dr. Hartman right away.

108
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,522
Oh, my God, what if
it's something serious?

109
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:06,923
It's all right,
it's all right.

110
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,825
We'll be in good hands
with Dr. Hartman.

111
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,794
He handled
my reassignment surgery.

112
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:14,231
I think, emotionally, I've
always been a lizard, you know?

113
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:15,732
And now, I feel
comfortable finally

114
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,167
in my leathery,
scaly skin.

115
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,669
Kids, if you need me,

116
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:21,538
I'll be on the wall making
rapid, darting glances.

117
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,176
Is this just to get out
of my parents' visit?

118
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,344
No.

<i>No, you're stupid!</i>

122
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,421
Oh, hello, Griffins.

123
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,089
What can I help
you with today?

124
00:04:39,123 --> 00:04:42,526
Dr. Hartman, Peter has a huge
lump growing on his neck.

125
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,927
Mrs. Griffin,
that's called a "head."

126
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,562
I've been fooled
by that one before.

127
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,331
Well, will you
take a look at it?

128
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:48,832
I think it might
be a tumor.

129
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,267
Okay, let's
have a look.

130
00:04:51,302 --> 00:04:53,770
Oh, yes, it appears
that there is a...

131
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:55,105
Great rack, by the way.

132
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,340
Thank you.

133
00:04:56,374 --> 00:04:57,841
Well, thank Grandma
Griffin, really.

134
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,610
It appears you have
a subcutaneous vestigial twin

135
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:01,912
growing on your neck.

136
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:03,280
What is that?

137
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:04,681
Well, it's
an incomplete twin

138
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:06,516
that never developed
into a fully-formed person

139
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:08,852
but still exists as a growth
feeding off your body.

140
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:10,120
Now, hold still.

141
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:11,888
I'm just gonna give you
a little topical anesthetic,

142
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:13,090
and we'll have
a closer look.

143
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:18,061
(high-pitched voice):
Hi, everybody!

144
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:19,796
Aah! What the
hell is that?!

145
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,765
Oh, my God!
It's a little me!

146
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:24,067
Well, it looks as if he's more
fully formed than we thought.

147
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:26,570
Wow, your wife
is gorgeous!

148
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:28,105
Is that a foot?

149
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,272
Almost!

150
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:30,540
This is awesome!

151
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:32,209
Finally, I'll have an
interesting silhouette

152

00:05:58,363 --> 00:06:00,331
1972.
Cool.

161
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:02,800
I'm gonna go show my penis
to some kids.

162
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:05,369
Hey, Dad. How'd it
go at the hospital?

163
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:07,204
Kids, remember
how when you were little,

164
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,773
you always wanted
a neck uncle?

165
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,608
No.
Well, now you got one!

166
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:11,842
(screaming)

167
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:13,310
What is that thing?!

168
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:14,912
This is my vestigial twin.

169
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:16,147
I named him Chip.

170
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:17,882
You know, like
"chip off the old neck."

171
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,984
I like to poke him
'cause it makes him happy,

172
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:22,119
and I feel it a little bit
in my nads.

173
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:24,789
(both giggle)

174
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:26,424
Well, keep that freakish thing
under wraps.

175
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,192
I don't want it
cramping my style

176
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:29,693
while I'm macking on toddlers.

177
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,233
See you around, bitch.

178
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:38,636
You know, Lois, a lot of times
you go into someone's house,

179
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,604
and it's just a house,
but you can tell

180
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,107
this is a home
by all the love here.

181
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,542
Aw! Aw!
Aw! Aw!

182
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:47,211
Peter, this seems unnatural,
and, quite frankly, dangerous.

183
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:49,747
Hey, you must be the owner
of that Prius outside.

184
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:51,148
Thanks for saving
the world.

185
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:52,550
He gets it.

186
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:55,152
He gets what we Prius
owners are trying to do.

187
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,254
Wow, the world
is such a cool place.

188
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,256
There's so much
I want to do and see!

189
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,826
Oh, he's such a great
energy to have around.

190
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,895
Ah, Chip, I am gonna show you
all kinds of cool stuff.

191
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,165
My Hot Wheels, my lawn darts,
even my new musket.

192
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,201
(rapid, rhythmic whirring)

193
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:12,303
Peter, what the
hell are you doing?

194
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:14,405
Lois, I thought
I heard a noise downstairs.

195
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,806
Go stall 'em for 20 minutes

196
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:17,908
and pray that it's not
too damp in here.

197
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,877
(strums chord)

198
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,679
Man, how do you know
so many songs?

199
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:23,681
Oh, when you're trapped
under a layer of fat,

200
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:26,050
a muffled folk song
is like manna from Heaven.

201
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:27,318
Give me a C.

202
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:28,953
(strums chord)

203
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:31,922
♪ Michael, row
the boat ashore ♪

204
00:07:31,957 --> 00:07:35,326
♪ Hallelujah

205
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,496
BOTH:
♪ Michael, row the boat ashore

206
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,398
♪ Hallelujah

207
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,601

208
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:46,770
♪ Sister, help
to trim the sail ♪

209
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:49,773

210
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:52,076
♪ Sister, help to trim...

211
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,310
(roaring)

212
00:07:53,345 --> 00:07:54,612
Aah! Run!

213
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:58,048
No, Peter, gently stroke
his snout counterclockwise.

214
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:02,953
Wow, it's working.

215
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:05,489
There's a universal language
for all creatures,

216
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:06,957
and it's called love.

217
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,726
Now, how about
that River Jordan?

218
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,196
♪ River Jordan
is deep and wide ♪

219
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,165
♪ Hallelujah

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,534

ALL: ♪ Milk and honey

222
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:23,073
♪ Hallelujah.

223
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,909
(strums ending chord)

224
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:29,280
Good morning, boys.

225
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:30,981
What's in store
for today?

226
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:33,317
Well, I thought we'd start
with a vigorous power walk

227
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:34,752
around the neighborhood.

228
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:37,555
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. I was thinking
we would just watch Dr. Oz</i>

229
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:39,423
and eat cold cuts
off our stomach.

230
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,795
Those people ain't taking
good care of themselves.

231
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:47,064
What?! But there's so much
to do and experience!

232
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:48,332
Did you know

233
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:50,367
that the Quahog Museum
has an interactive display

234
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:52,069
on the history
of the garment district?

235
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:53,783
Oh, look, Chip, Chip,
slow down, all right?

236
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:55,439
You know, just because
everything's new to you

237
00:08:55,473 --> 00:08:57,408
doesn't mean
you have to do it all at once.

238
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:59,443
Peter, where's your sense
of fun and adventure?

239
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:01,645
You're starting to sound
like a stick-in-the-mud.

240
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,347
Well, that stuff
sounds exhausting.

241
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:05,716
I'm just being honest,
like George Washington.

242
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,185
George, did you chop down
our cherry tree?

243
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:10,487
I cannot tell
a lie. Yes.

244
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:13,023
And what is this pamphlet
I found under your bed

245
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:14,892
called "The Boston He Party?"

246
00:09:14,926 --> 00:09:16,660
Not mine.

247
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,601
Wow! Is there any
better time in the world

248
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:25,736
than 11:00 a.m.
on a Wednesday?

249
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,606
You already have two days
of hard work under your belt,

250
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,608
and there's so much
more work to come.

251
00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:32,776
Look, I'm trying to get
this stuff done here.

252
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:34,979
Griffin, did you finish
those purchasing reports?

253
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:36,647
Oh, that voice!

254
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:38,282
It's like God sneezing!

255
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:39,516
What the hell is this?

256
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,151
They found a guy
on my neck.

257
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:42,419
Hello there.

258
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:44,989
I've never met a supervisor,
slash supermodel before.

259
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:46,624
Do you like crab?

260
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:49,193
There's a knockout crab place
right around the corner.

261
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:50,561
What the hell are you doing?

262
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:52,563
I'm using my knowledge
of the local food scene

263
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:54,732
to get this woman
to go to bed with me.

264
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,901
Well, now we know.

265
00:09:57,936 --> 00:10:00,237
I can taste
what he eats.

266
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:04,575
What are we watching?
Oh, it's just a tennis match.

267
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:06,410
So this is tennis!

268
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:07,645
(racket hits ball)
Wow!

269
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,650
(to tennis balls hitting):
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

270
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:13,984
MAN (on TV):
15-love.

271
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,386
That was just one point?!

272
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,155
Federer and Hastings are known
for their long rallies.

273
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:19,456
Federer to serve.

274
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:24,328
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow! Wow!

275
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:26,397
Wow! Wow!

276
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,334
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

277
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:31,735
<i>Wow!</i>

278
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,903
15 all.

279
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:34,338
And this is just
the first game

280
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:36,473
of the first round
of a three-week tournament?

281
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:37,775
Yay!

282
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,443
(sighs) This is more painful
than sitting

283
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:41,745
through those
parent-teacher-cheetah meetings.

284
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,014
So, in short, your kids
are all doing great.

285
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,516
Keep reading to
them every night,

286
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,751
and I think we're gonna
have a great year.

287
00:10:47,786 --> 00:10:49,186
So unless there
are any questions,

288
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,454
thank you all
for coming.

289
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:52,656
Uh, yeah, I noticed
the hot lunch menu

290
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:54,491
doesn't feature
any gazelle.

291
00:10:54,526 --> 00:10:55,693
(others groan loudly)

292
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:57,561
I'll bring that
up to the board.

293
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:59,830
Yeah. See, I-I heard
that last year,

294
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:02,800
(chuckling): and...
here we are again.

295
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:06,303
♪

296
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:07,805
Listen, Doc, is
there any way

297
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,740
you can have this thing
on my neck removed?

298
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:12,042
Well, Mr. Griffin, your organs
and his are intertwined.

299
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:13,644
That would be a highly
dangerous procedure.

300
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:14,945
You could die.

301
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:16,714
On the other hand,
if you live,

302
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:18,615
I'll let you pick any prize
off that shelf.

303
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,184
Even the tiny
pinball machine?

304
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:21,952
Oh, that-that shouldn't
have been up there.

305
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:24,021
Look, Doc, you got to do
the procedure, all right?

306
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:25,456
I-I don't care
if I die.

307
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,057
I mean, maybe in
my next life,

308
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:28,992
I'll come back as an
air bag or something.

309
00:11:31,162 --> 00:11:33,897
(rhythmic ticking)

310
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:36,266
It's okay. It's okay.
Peter's got you.

311
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,568
Don't you worry.

312
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:39,169
Everything's gonna
be all right.

313
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:40,528
Is my wife okay?

314
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,553
No, the ski boots
that was in the back

315
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:44,575
flew up and chopped
her head off.

316
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:47,845
You can turn your blinker

Ah, crap, I'm out of beer.

483
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,820
Great. I have to walk
down these stairs

484
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:29,556
the one day I wore heels.

485

488
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:34,961
Son of a bitch!

489
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:36,797
I think I broke my leg!

490
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:39,266
(grunting)

491
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,068
There's no way I'm gonna make it
back up those stairs.

492
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:43,403
(phone ringing)

493
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:46,139
Nope.

494
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:50,110
Peter? It's me, Chip.

495
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:53,113
Listen, I... I'm sorry
for the mean things I said.

496
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:55,315
Help!
Peter?

497
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,419
Holy smokes!
Peter, are you okay?

498
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:00,954
These books was already
down here!

499
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:02,222
I'm not a nerd!

500
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,324
Oh, my God!

501
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:07,060
We got to get this leg set
and get you to the hospital!

502
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:09,396
<i>Oh, cool. That's the place
with all the Ghostbusters cars!</i>

503
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:11,832
(grunts)

504
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:21,808
(grunting)

505
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:26,246
(loud grunting)

506

(high-pitched flatulence)
(giggles)

507
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:31,551
If you had only done that
while you were here,

508
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:33,053
we wouldn't be in this mess.

509
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:38,859
Mr. Griffin,
you're a lucky man.

510
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:41,728
If it weren't for Chip here,
you might have lost your leg.

511
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,463
The bad news is,
we did an X-ray,

512
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:45,832
and your body is full
of a spooky skeleton man.

513
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,568
Gosh, Chip, I don't
know how to thank you.

514
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:50,003
No problem, Peter.

515
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:51,972
You would have done
the same thing for me.

516
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:54,641
You know, Chip, Lois
was right about you.

517
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,376
You are special.

518
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,446
You've got all the sense of
wonder that I somehow lost.

519
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,648
I got so used to watching TV

520
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,884
and looking for tiny
jean fibers in my nuts,

521
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:06,820
I forgot there's a whole
world out there to experience.

522
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:08,421
Thank you for
showing me that.

523
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,156
As far as I'm concerned,

524
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:12,359
you're a permanent
part of our family now.

525
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:15,095
Well, that sure is nice of you,
Peter, but...

526
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:17,397
there's a big old world
out there.

527
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:20,000
I want to go out
and experience it for myself.

528
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:21,701
ALL: Aw!
Why?

529
00:20:21,736 --> 00:20:25,138
Well, I'm sorry to see you go,
but I understand.

530
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:27,374
Oh, we're gonna miss you, Chip.

531
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:34,748
I'm too tough to cry,
but I'm gonna miss you, too.

532
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,720
Safe travels, buddy,
and keep in touch.

533
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:42,088
I will!

534
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:44,524
Whee!

535
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,259
Good-bye, Chip!
Bye!

536
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:48,428
Come back soon, okay?

537
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:50,263
<i>PATRICK STEWART:
But Chip never did come back.</i>

538
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:54,495
<i>He became the new, young,
funny kid on ABC's The Middle.</i>

539
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:00,000
Wow! This is just a whole
bunch of loud garbage!
