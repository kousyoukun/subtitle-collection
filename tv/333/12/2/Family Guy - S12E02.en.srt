Dr. Hartman, is everything
all right with my dad?

322
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,402
Griffins, I'm afraid we lost him.

323
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,404
What? Oh, my God!

324
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,156
-Hey, guys.
-Oh, there he is.

325
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,200
It worked! I'm free at last!

326
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,244
But what about Chip? Where's Chip?

327
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,455
Hey, everybody, look who's walking!

328
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,207
OTHERS: Chip!

329
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,001
Oh, Chip, I'm so glad you're okay.

330
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,753
Yeah, and I'm okay, too.

331
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,005
So, uh, you know, Chip,
now that you're a free man,

332
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,799
this is a chance for you to go out

333
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,467
and make a real life
for yourself someplace.

334
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,677
I'll tell you what,

335
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,136
anywhere you want to go, I'll FedEx you.

336
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,930
What are you talking about, Peter?

337
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,932
Chip is part of our family.

338
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,475
-He's staying with us.
-What?

339
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,727
-Yay! Yay!
-Awesome!

340
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,855
Hey, hey, Dad?
Yeah, I'm done.

341
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,898
Can you pick me up?

342
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,984
Oh, that's okay. I have a book.

343
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,033
Oh, hey, Peter.

344
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,451
Lois, where's the couch?

345
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,996
Chip redecorated the room
to improve the feng shui.

346
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,957
He said our old furniture was
blocking the flow of energy.

347
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,626
I had my life's
fart savings in that couch!

348
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,962
-And where are the drapes?
-Chip took them

349
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,464
-to make play clothes for the children.
-What?

350

Oh, hey, Peter. You're home.

353
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,015
Hi, Dad! Hi, Daddy.

354
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,683
We dug a lake for this!

355
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,976
ALL: Whoa!

356
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,979
Come out of that water at once!

357
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,606
Gosh, isn't Chip wonderful?

358
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,816
No, he's not wonderful, Lois,
he's annoying.

359
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,902
I don't get why everyone's
so in love with that guy.

360
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,196
-What's so great about him?
-Well, to be honest,

361
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,449
the same thing that used to be
so great about you.

362
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,992
What? What are you talking about?

363
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,410
Just that when you were younger,

364
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,704
you were as passionate
and full of life as him.

365
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,918
(HIGH-PITCHED) Hey, boys,
catch me if you can!

366
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,631
Oh, crap!
I didn't realize they had bikes!

367
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,050
(GROANS) What are they gonna do
when they catch me?

368
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,718
Oh, boy, I got
a back-of-the-head punch coming,

00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,011

Oh, sorry, Peter, we couldn't find you.

379

Do you want to sing your part, Peter?

380
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,915
Go ahead.

I tell you, Chip is making my life
a living hell, you guys.

385
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,055
Remind me again, Chip is
that African kid you adopted?

386
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,058
No, that was Chocolate Chip.
We gave him back to Kenya.

387
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,935
But I can't take it anymore.
I got to get rid of him.

388

-I don't know yet,

but I'll come up with something.

390
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,023
After all, I'm the guy who invented

"Choose Your Own Adventure

-Peter, what the hell is that thing?

401
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,180
It's a dingo. I named him Bingo.

402
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,265
If you can't have fun
with that, you're crazy.

Oh, he's gonna turn you

-Here, let's play steak catch.

00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,962
Peter, that dingo was meant
to eat me, wasn't it?

417
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,464
Why would you do that?

418
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,091
Because my life was fine
before you showed up.

419
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,552
My family liked me,
and-and I didn't feel bad

420

about not ever doing new stuff.

421
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,890
Well, I never asked to
grow out of your neck.

My life was better before I met you, too!

You're a terrible brother,

He's gone.

Oh, hey, Peter. Where's Chip?

432

I haven't seen him all day.

433
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,797
He likes to yell out "Good luck!"

434
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,465
after they read each lottery number.

435
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,133
He's gone. I threw him out.

436
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,260
-You what?
-No!

437
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,011
Peter, how could you?

438
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,097
Whoa, whoa, what are you all
coming down on me for?

439

441
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,936
Peter, Chip was a part of our family.

442
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,229
And he's so little.

443
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,106
He can get hurt out there on his own.

444
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,566
We got to go find him.

445
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,776
We should look for him
in the ball pit at McDonald's.

446
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,945
You can just leave me there,
I'll conduct the search.

447
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,907
Meg's right! Come on, kids,
let's go find Chip and bring him back!

00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,267
I'm not a nerd!

476
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,561
Oh, my God!

477
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,480
We got to get this leg set
and get you to the hospital!

478
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:09,024
Oh, cool. That's the place
with all the <i>Ghostbusters</i> cars!

-(HIGH-PITCHED FLATULENCE)

483
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,713
If you had only done that
while you were here,

484
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:32,965
we wouldn't be in this mess.

485
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,012
Mr. Griffin, you're a lucky man.

486
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,557
If it weren't for Chip here,
you might have lost your leg.

487
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,350
The bad news is, we did an X-ray,

488
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,978
and your body is full
of a spooky skeleton man.

489
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,856
Gosh, Chip, I don't know how to thank you.

490
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,232
No problem, Peter.

491
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,942
You would have done
the same thing for me.

492
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,570
You know, Chip, Lois
was right about you.

493
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,572
You are special.

494
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:59,283
You've got all the sense of
wonder that I somehow lost.

495
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,952
I got so used to watching TV

496
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,996
and looking for tiny
jean fibers in my nuts,

497
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,582
I forgot there's a whole
world out there to experience.

498
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,584
Thank you for showing me that.

499
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,419
As far as I'm concerned,

500
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,462
you're a permanent
part of our family now.

501
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:15,299
Well, that sure is nice of you,
Peter, but...

502
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,551
there's a big old world out there.

503
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,887
I want to go out
and experience it for myself.

504
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,555
-ALL: Aw!
-Why?

505
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:25,434
Well, I'm sorry to see you go,
but I understand.

506
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,227
Oh, we're gonna miss you, Chip.

507
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,234
I'm too tough to cry,
but I'm gonna miss you, too.

508
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,991
Safe travels, buddy, and keep in touch.

509
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,242
I will!

510
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,661
Whee!

511
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,246
-Good-bye, Chip!
-Bye!

512
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,915
Come back soon, okay?

513
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,584
