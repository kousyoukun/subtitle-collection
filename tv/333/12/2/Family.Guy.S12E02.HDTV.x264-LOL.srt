12
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,280
Peter, come on,
get dressed.

13
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:37,614
We're late
for church.

14
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,249
I don't want to
go to church.

15
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:41,819
I always feel like that
priest has it in for me.

16
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:43,821
Body of Christ.

17
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:45,823
Body of Christ.

18
00:00:45,857 --> 00:00:47,091
Butt of Christ.

19
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,326
Aah! Lois, trade me.
No.

20
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:52,629
You're not wearing that
to church, are you?

21
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:53,997
What? Yeah. Why not?

22
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:55,532
This is what
I always wear.

23
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:56,767
She's right, man.

24
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:57,935
It's Sunday. Get noticed.

25
00:00:57,969 --> 00:00:59,970
I'll be in the car.

26
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:03,874
I'm getting tired of you wearing
the same thing every day.

27
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:05,742
Look, that shirt's got
a hole in it.

28
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:08,612
I'd like to point out that Jesus
wore the same thing every day.

29
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:11,115
And you didn't hear Alice
giving him a hard time about it.

30
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:12,416
Who?
Wasn't that her name?

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,617
Let's just get to church.

32
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:15,119
And afterward,
you're going to the mall

33
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:16,286
to go clothes shopping.

34
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,721
Well, you're
coming with me.

35
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:20,157
Last time I tried shopping
without you, it was a disaster.

36
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,525
Hey, I'm home.

37
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,494
I got groceries.
You what?

38
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:24,801
Yeah, I was driving past there,

39
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:26,663
and we were out
of some stuff, so I...

40
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:28,832
You listen to me,
you son of a bitch!

41
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,801
I've got one thing
in this lifetime!

42
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:32,603
One thing.

43
00:01:32,637 --> 00:01:35,606
You always say I never
do anything around here.

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,942
Yeah, I like saying that more
than I like you doing things.

45
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:41,178
Dad, I got the rest
from the car. Where...?

46
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:42,579
Chris, run!
You were right!

47
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:43,747
She didn't appreciate it!

48
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:45,949
Oh, crap!

49
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,684
Ow!

50
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,019
That's right.

51
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:50,687
I do groceries.

52
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,361
All right, even though
we just walked in,

53
00:01:57,395 --> 00:02:00,297
and this whole place is one
hallway, let's consult the map.

54
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,965
Okay.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,233
Uh-oh.

56
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:11,108
I'll bet we can find you
some new clothes in here.

57
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:13,777
Hey, Lois, are you sure
this place is for men?

58
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:15,179
Yes, Peter, it's for everyone.

59
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:17,481
Really? 'Cause this-this
kind of looks like a dress.

60
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:19,650
Peter, it's fine.
Come on out.

61
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:22,753
Ha! You gaybo!

62
00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:26,557
Hang on, Peter.

63
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:29,026
I'm gonna go look for a couple
things for me in here.

64
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,194
I'll be right back.

65
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:31,595
Okay, Lois, I'll
be right here,

66
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:34,231
standing uncomfortably close to
the unnecessary piano player

67
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:35,999
in the middle of the mall.

68
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,870
So, what's it like
now that you've made it?

69
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:41,305
Did you ever have
a bank account

70
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:43,040
full of pedestrians'
disinterested smiles?

71
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:44,474
You're amazing.

72
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:47,077
I'm gonna sit Indian-style
on top of your piano.

73
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,148
There aren't enough verses
in any song I could write

74
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:54,017
that would express how much
hatred I have in my heart.

75
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:56,253
You talk like a book.

76
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:59,189
Hey, Lois,
how about we try Sears?

77
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:00,357
They got good stuff.

78
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:01,892
Peter, nobody's been
in Sears for decades.

79
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:03,627
Oh, come on.
When I was a boy,

80
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:05,502
we always used to go
clothes shopping at Sears.

81
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,197
Trust me. They'll have
everything I need.

82
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:14,037
What the hell happened here?

83
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:15,372
Look out!

84
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,712
He wants to know
who you are.

85
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:24,147
We seek clothes
for the cold times.

86
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:29,119
He says he'll take you to
the clothes for herbs and meat.

87
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:30,621
Well, we can probably come up

88
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:32,556
with some herbs
and meat, right, Peter?

89
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,991
Peter?

90
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:35,459
I'm with them now.

91
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:36,860
No girls allowed.

92
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:45,269
See, Lois, now,
this is more like it.

93
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:47,304
What the hell?
Why won't this button?

94
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:49,006
It's the same size
I always get.

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,941
Maybe you put on a
few pounds, sweetie.

96
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,143
Lois, I weigh the same
293 pounds today

97
00:03:53,177 --> 00:03:54,444
that I weighed
in grade school.

98
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,114
Perhaps it's this lump
on the side of your neck, sir.

99
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:58,582
Oh, my God, Peter!

100
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:00,384
How long have you
had that thing?

101
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:01,551
I-I don't know.

102
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:03,654
We got to go see
Dr. Hartman right away.

103
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,522
Oh, my God, what if
it's something serious?

104
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:06,923
It's all right,
it's all right.

105
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,825
We'll be in good hands
with Dr. Hartman.

106
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,794
He handled
my reassignment surgery.

107
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:14,231
I think, emotionally, I've
always been a lizard, you know?

108
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:15,732
And now, I feel
comfortable finally

109
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,167
in my leathery,
scaly skin.

110
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,669
Kids, if you need me,

111
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:21,538
I'll be on the wall making
rapid, darting glances.

112
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,176
Is this just to get out
of my parents' visit?

113
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,344
No.

114
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:30,547
Hello!

115
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:35,986
No, <i>you're</i> stupid!

116
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,421
Oh, hello, Griffins.

117
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,089
What can I help
you with today?

118
00:04:39,123 --> 00:04:42,526
Dr. Hartman, Peter has a huge
lump growing on his neck.

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,927
Mrs. Griffin,
that's called a "head."

120
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,562
I've been fooled
by that one before.

121
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,331
Well, will you
take a look at it?

122
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:48,832
I think it might
be a tumor.

123
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,267
Okay, let's
have a look.

124
00:04:51,302 --> 00:04:53,770
Oh, yes, it appears
that there is a...

125
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:55,105
Great rack, by the way.

126
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,340
Thank you.

127
00:04:56,374 --> 00:04:57,841
Well, thank Grandma
Griffin, really.

128
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,610
It appears you have
a subcutaneous vestigial twin

129
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:01,912
growing on your neck.

130
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:03,280
What is that?

131
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:04,681
Well, it's
an incomplete twin

132
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:06,516
that never developed
into a fully-formed person

133
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:08,852
but still exists as a growth
feeding off your body.

134
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:10,120
Now, hold still.

135
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:11,888
I'm just gonna give you
a little topical anesthetic,

136
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:13,090
and we'll have
a closer look.

137
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:18,061
Hi, everybody!

138
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:19,796
Aah! What the
hell is that?!

139
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,765
Oh, my God!
It's a little me!

140
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:24,067
Well, it looks as if he's more
fully formed than we thought.

141
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:26,570
Wow, your wife
is gorgeous!

142
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:28,105
Is that a foot?

143
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,272
Almost!

144
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:30,540
This is awesome!

145
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:32,209
Finally, I'll have an
interesting silhouette

146
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:34,611
for the beginning of
my spoken-word jazz.

147
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,316
I left...

148
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,318
my poem...

149
00:05:41,352 --> 00:05:43,353
at home.

150
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:50,268
We now return to <i>Quantum Creep.</i>

151
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:56,274
Al, what year is it?

152
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,276
1972.
Cool.

153
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,745
I'm gonna go show my penis
to some kids.

154
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,314
Hey, Dad. How'd it
go at the hospital?

155
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:05,149
Kids, remember
how when you were little,

156
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:06,718
you always wanted
a neck uncle?

157
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:08,553
No.
Well, now you got one!

158
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:11,255
What is that thing?!

159
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,857
This is my vestigial twin.

160
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,092
I named him Chip.

161
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:15,827
You know, like
"chip off the old neck."

162
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:17,929
I like to poke him
'cause it makes him happy,

163
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:20,064
and I feel it a little bit
in my nads.

164
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:24,369
Well, keep that freakish thing
under wraps.

165
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,137
I don't want it
cramping my style

166
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:27,638
while I'm macking on toddlers.

167
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,178
See you around, bitch.

168
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:36,581
You know, Lois, a lot of times
you go into someone's house,

169
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:38,549
and it's just a house,
but you can tell

170
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:41,052
this is a home
by all the love here.

171
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:42,487
Aw! Aw!
Aw! Aw!

172
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:45,156
Peter, this seems unnatural,
and, quite frankly, dangerous.

173
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,692
Hey, you must be the owner
of that Prius outside.

174
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:49,093
Thanks for saving
the world.

175
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:50,495
He gets it.

176
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:53,097
He gets what we Prius
owners are trying to do.

177
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:55,199
Wow, the world
is such a cool place.

178
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:57,201
There's so much
I want to do and see!

179
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:59,771
Oh, he's such a great
energy to have around.

180
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:02,840
Ah, Chip, I am gonna show you
all kinds of cool stuff.

181
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,110
My Hot Wheels, my lawn darts,
even my new musket.

182
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,248
Peter, what the
hell are you doing?

183
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:12,350
Lois, I thought
I heard a noise downstairs.

184
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:13,751
Go stall 'em for 20 minutes

185
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,853
and pray that it's not
too damp in here.

186
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:19,624
Man, how do you know
so many songs?

187
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:21,626
Oh, when you're trapped
under a layer of fat,

188
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,995
a muffled folk song
is like manna from Heaven.

189
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:25,263
Give me a C.

190
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:29,867
♪ Michael, row
the boat ashore ♪

191

No, Peter, gently stroke
his snout counterclockwise.

200
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,898
Wow, it's working.

201
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,434
There's a universal language
for all creatures,

202
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:04,902
and it's called love.

203
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:06,671
Now, how about
that River Jordan?

204

209
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:27,225
Good morning, boys.

210
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,926
What's in store
for today?

211
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:31,262
Well, I thought we'd start
with a vigorous power walk

212
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:32,697
around the neighborhood.

213
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:35,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I was thinking
we would just watch <i>Dr. Oz</i>

214
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,368
and eat cold cuts
off our stomach.

215
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:42,740
Those people ain't taking
good care of themselves.

216
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:45,009
What?! But there's so much
to do and experience!

217
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:46,277
Did you know

218
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,312
that the Quahog Museum
has an interactive display

219
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:50,014
on the history
of the garment district?

220
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:51,728
Oh, look, Chip, Chip,
slow down, all right?

221
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,384
You know, just because
everything's new to you

222
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:55,353
doesn't mean
you have to do it all at once.

223
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:57,388
Peter, where's your sense
of fun and adventure?

224
00:08:57,422 --> 00:08:59,590
You're starting to sound
like a stick-in-the-mud.

225
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,292
Well, that stuff
sounds exhausting.

226
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,661
I'm just being honest,
like George Washington.

227
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:06,130
George, did you chop down
our cherry tree?

228
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:08,432
I cannot tell
a lie. Yes.

229
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:10,968
And what is this pamphlet
I found under your bed

230
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:12,837
called "The Boston He Party?"

231
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:14,605
Not mine.

232
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:21,546
Wow! Is there any
better time in the world

233
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,681
than 11:00 a.m.
on a Wednesday?

234
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:26,551
You already have two days
of hard work under your belt,

235
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:28,553
and there's so much
more work to come.

236
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:30,721
Look, I'm trying to get
this stuff done here.

237
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:32,924
Griffin, did you finish
those purchasing reports?

238
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,592
Oh, that voice!

239
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:36,227
It's like God sneezing!

240
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:37,461
What the hell is this?

241
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:39,096
They found a guy
on my neck.

242
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:40,364
Hello there.

243
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,934
I've never met a supervisor,
slash supermodel before.

244
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:44,569
Do you like crab?

245
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:47,138
There's a knockout crab place
right around the corner.

246
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,506
What the hell are you doing?

247
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,508
I'm using my knowledge
of the local food scene

248
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,677
to get this woman
to go to bed with me.

249
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:55,846
Well, now we know.

250
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:58,182
I can taste
what he eats.

251
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:02,520
What are we watching?
Oh, it's just a tennis match.

252
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:04,355
So this is tennis!

253
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:05,590
Wow!

254
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:10,595
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

255
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:11,929
15-love.

256
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:13,331
That was just one point?!

257
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:16,100
Federer and Hastings are known
for their long rallies.

258
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:17,401
Federer to serve.

259
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:22,273
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow! Wow!

260
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:24,342
Wow! Wow!

261
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:28,279
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

262
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:29,680
<i>Wow!</i>

263
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:30,848
15 all.

264
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:32,283
And this is just
the first game

265
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:34,418
of the first round
of a three-week tournament?

266
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:35,720
Yay!

267
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:37,388
This is more painful
than sitting

268
00:10:37,422 --> 00:10:39,690
through those
parent-teacher-cheetah meetings.

269
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,959
So, in short, your kids
are all doing great.

270
00:10:41,994 --> 00:10:43,461
Keep reading to
them every night,

271
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:45,696
and I think we're gonna
have a great year.

272
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,131
So unless there
are any questions,

273
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,399
thank you all
for coming.

274
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,601
Uh, yeah, I noticed
the hot lunch menu

275
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:52,436
doesn't feature
any gazelle.

276
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:55,506
I'll bring that
up to the board.

277
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,775
Yeah. See, I-I heard
that last year,

278
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:00,745
and...
here we are again.

279
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:05,750
Listen, Doc, is
there any way

280
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:07,685
you can have this thing
on my neck removed?

281
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,987
Well, Mr. Griffin, your organs
and his are intertwined.

282
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:11,589
That would be a highly
dangerous procedure.

283
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:12,890
You could die.

284
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:14,659
On the other hand,
if you live,

285
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:16,560
I'll let you pick any prize
off that shelf.

286
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:18,129
Even the tiny
pinball machine?

287
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:19,897
Oh, that-that shouldn't
have been up there.

288
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:21,966
Look, Doc, you got to do
the procedure, all right?

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,401
I-I don't care
if I die.

290
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:25,002
I mean, maybe in
my next life,

291
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:26,937
I'll come back as an
air bag or something.

292
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:34,211
It's okay. It's okay.
Peter's got you.

293
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:35,513
Don't you worry.

294
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:37,114
Everything's gonna
be all right.

295
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:38,473
Is my wife okay?

296
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,498
No, the ski boots
that was in the back

297
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,520
flew up and chopped
her head off.

298
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:45,790
You can turn your blinker
off now; it's very annoying.

299
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,707
Nurse, have somebody
fix that clock.

300
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:03,874
It's very distracting.

301
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:06,010
All right,
let's get this started.

302
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:14,819
All right, halfway done.

303
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:16,487
Time for a break.

304
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:23,427
♪ I hate myself

305
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:25,529
♪ For loving you

306
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:27,298
♪ Can't break free

307
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:29,667
♪ From the things
that you do... ♪

308
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:35,973
Oh, God, I'm
so nervous.

309
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:38,242
Thank God Stewie's too
little to understand.

310
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:40,845
Look at him over there,
playing that board game.

311
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,246
Ah, three.

312
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,482
Okay, one, two...

313
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,183
Sorry!

314
00:12:46,218 --> 00:12:49,520
<i>Sorry! The board game</i>
<i>that teaches you to be a dick.</i>

315
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:53,190
Dr. Hartman, is everything
all right with my dad?

316
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:55,693
Griffins, I'm
afraid we lost him.

317
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:57,695
What?!
Oh, my God!

318
00:12:57,729 --> 00:12:59,463
Hey, guys.
Oh, there he is.

319
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:01,499
It worked!
I'm free at last!

320
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,567
But what about Chip?
Where's Chip?

321
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:06,704
Hey, everybody,
look who's walking!

322
00:13:06,738 --> 00:13:08,539
Chip!

323
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,041
Oh, Chip,
I'm so glad you're okay.

324
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:12,877
Yeah, and I'm
okay, too.

325
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:15,212
So, uh, you know, Chip,
now that you're a free man,

326
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:17,081
this is a chance
for you to go out

327
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:18,716
and make a real life
for yourself someplace.

328
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,850
I'll tell you what,

329
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:21,485
anywhere you want to
go, I'll FedEx you.

330
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,154
What are you
talking about, Peter?

331
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:25,156
Chip is part of our family.

332
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,057
He's staying with us.
What?!

333
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:29,260
Yay!
Yay! Awesome!

334
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:31,128
Hey, hey, Dad?
Yeah, I'm done.

335
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:32,997
Can you pick me up?

336
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:35,032
Oh, that's okay;
I have a book.

337
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,295
Oh, hey, Peter.

338
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:44,796
Lois, where's the couch?

339
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,299
Chip redecorated the room
to improve the feng shui.

340
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,268
He said our old furniture was
blocking the flow of energy.

341
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:52,904
I had my life's
fart savings in that couch!

342
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:55,273
And where are the drapes?
Chip took them

343
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:56,704
to make play clothes
for the children.

344
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:57,843
What?!

345
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:04,549
Oh, hey, Peter.
You're home.

346
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:06,218
Hi, Dad!
Hi, Daddy.

347
00:14:06,252 --> 00:14:07,853
We dug a lake
for this!

348
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:09,388
Whoa!

349
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:12,190
Come out of that water at once!

350
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,792
Gosh, isn't Chip
wonderful?

351
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:15,494
No, he's not wonderful,
Lois; he's annoying.

352
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:18,163
I don't get why everyone's
so in love with that guy.

353
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:20,532
What's so great about him?
Well, to be honest,

354
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:23,702
the same thing that used to be
so great about you.

355
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,237
What? What are you
talking about?

356
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:26,705
Just that when
you were younger,

357
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:29,274
you were as passionate
and full of life as him.

358
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:32,511
Hey, boys,

359
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:34,713
catch me
if you can!

360
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:38,884
Oh, crap!
I didn't realize they had bikes!

361
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:41,153
What are they gonna do
when they catch me?

362
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:43,355
Oh, boy, I got a
back-of-the-head punch coming,

363
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:44,690
I just know it!

370

You're singing our
song without me?

371
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:09,448
Oh, sorry, Peter,
we couldn't find you.

372
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:11,516
Do you want to sing
your part, Peter?

373
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:13,051

I tell you,
Chip is making my life

378
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:26,264
a living hell,
you guys.

379
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,500
Remind me again, Chip is
that African kid you adopted?

380
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:30,769
No, that was Chocolate Chip.
We gave him back to Kenya.

381
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:33,438
But I can't take it anymore.
I got to get rid of him.

382
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,440
Well, what are you gonna do?
I don't know yet,

383
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:36,641
but I'll come up
with something.

384
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:38,343
After all, I'm the guy
who invented

385
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:40,579
"Choose Your Own Adventure
or Have Pie in Bed."

386
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:42,681
I picked the pie again.

387
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:51,723
Hey, welcome back to
the <i>Mikey Tony Magnanimous Hour,</i>

388
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:54,326
where real people get
magnanimous about real things.

389
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,762
This week's real thing--
hey, Native Americans,

390
00:15:56,796 --> 00:15:58,764
if I saw you
on the street begging,

391
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:00,665
I'd throw a buck
in your moccasin.

392
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,434
Next week's magnanimous thing--

393
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:05,237
I'm wearing this yellow
bracelet. You're welcome.

394
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,572
Peter, what the
hell is that thing?

395
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:09,574
It's a dingo.
I named him Bingo.

396
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:11,710
If you can't have fun
with that, you're crazy.

397
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,880
Hey, Peter.

398
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:16,214
Wh-What's that?

399
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:18,850
Oh, he's gonna turn you
into a pile on Joe's lawn.

400
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:20,886
What?!
Here, let's play steak catch.

401
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,120
Oh, boy, I got it!

402
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:23,455
Hey, back to you, Peter!

403
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:25,190
Ah, cool! Steak catch!

404
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:27,592
I'm gonna use my one
steak-in-the-pants time-out.

405
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:29,961
Aah! No! Not me! Not me!

406
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:31,463
Attack him! Aah!

407
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:34,933
Hey, um, it's 3:00 p.m.
Should I give up on breakfast?

408
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:37,068
Aah! Brian!

409
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:38,503
Browser history--
clear it!

410
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:42,307
Peter, that dingo was meant
to eat me, wasn't it?

411
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:43,942
Why would you do that?

412
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:46,411
Because my life was fine
before you showed up.

413
00:16:46,445 --> 00:16:48,847
My family liked me,
and-and I didn't feel bad

414
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,582
about not ever doing new stuff.

415
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:53,084
Well, I never asked to
grow out of your neck.

416
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:56,121
My life was better
before I met you, too!

417
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:59,024
You're a terrible brother,
husband and father.

418
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:01,526
I'm out of here,
and you could go to hell!

419
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:04,429
Wow, what a nice day out!
Look! A rainbow!

420
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:05,964
I did it.

421
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:07,399
He's gone.

422
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:10,869
Just as easy as
the creation of techno music.

423
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:12,838
Wait a minute,
what key are we in?

424
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:14,873
No, no, no, no,
no, none of that.

425
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:21,446
Oh, hey, Peter.
Where's Chip?

426
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,215
I haven't seen him
all day.

427
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:24,983
He likes to yell out
"Good luck!"

428
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:26,785
after they read
each lottery number.

429
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,420
He's gone.
I threw him out.

430
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:29,654
You what?
No!

431
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:31,489
Peter, how could you?

432
00:17:31,524 --> 00:17:33,558
Whoa, whoa, what are you all
coming down on me for?

433
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,993
Meg throws away people who come
out of her body all the time,

434
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:36,995
nobody says nothing.

435
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:39,064
Peter, Chip was
a part of our family.

436
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:40,232
And he's so little.

437
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:42,367
He can get hurt
out there on his own.

438
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:43,969
We got to go find him.

439
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:46,304
We should look for him
in the ball pit at McDonald's.

440
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:48,419
You can just leave me there;
I'll conduct the search.

441
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,175
Meg's right!
Come on, kids,

442
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:52,744
let's go find Chip
and bring him back!

443
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:55,347
You guys do whatever you want.
I got stuff to do, anyway.

444
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:57,349
I got to get ready
for my Bar Mitzvah.

454

Great. I have to walk
down these stairs

455
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:28,046
the one day I wore heels.

456
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:33,451
Son of a bitch!

457
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:35,287
I think I broke my leg!

458
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,558
There's no way I'm gonna make it
back up those stairs.

459
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:44,629
Nope.

460
00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:48,600
Peter? It's me, Chip.

461
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:51,603
Listen, I... I'm sorry
for the mean things I said.

462
00:18:51,637 --> 00:18:53,805
Help!
Peter?

463
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,909
Holy smokes!
Peter, are you okay?

464
00:18:57,944 --> 00:18:59,444
These books was already
down here!

465
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:00,712
I'm not a nerd!

466
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,814
Oh, my God!

467
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:05,550
We got to get this leg set
and get you to the hospital!

468
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,886
Oh, cool. That's the place
with all the <i>Ghostbusters</i> cars!

469
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:30,041
If you had only done that
while you were here,

470
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:31,543
we wouldn't be in this mess.

471
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,349
Mr. Griffin,
you're a lucky man.

472
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:40,218
If it weren't for Chip here,
you might have lost your leg.

473
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:41,953
The bad news is,
we did an X-ray,

474
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:44,322
and your body is full
of a spooky skeleton man.

475
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:47,058
Gosh, Chip, I don't
know how to thank you.

476
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:48,493
No problem, Peter.

477
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,462
You would have done
the same thing for me.

478
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:53,131
You know, Chip, Lois
was right about you.

479
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:54,866
You are special.

480
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,936
You've got all the sense of
wonder that I somehow lost.

481
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,138
I got so used to watching TV

482
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:02,374
and looking for tiny
jean fibers in my nuts,

483
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:05,310
I forgot there's a whole
world out there to experience.

484
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:06,911
Thank you for
showing me that.

485
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:08,646
As far as I'm concerned,

486
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:10,849
you're a permanent
part of our family now.

487
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:13,585
Well, that sure is nice of you,
Peter, but...

488
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,887
there's a big old world
out there.

489
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:18,490
I want to go out
and experience it for myself.

490
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:20,191
Aw!
Why?

491
00:20:20,226 --> 00:20:23,628
Well, I'm sorry to see you go,
but I understand.

492
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:25,864
Oh, we're gonna miss you, Chip.

493
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:33,238
I'm too tough to cry,
but I'm gonna miss you, too.

494
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:39,210
Safe travels, buddy,
and keep in touch.

495
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:40,578
I will!

496
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,014
Whee!

497
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,749
Good-bye, Chip!
Bye!

498
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:46,918
Come back soon, okay?

499
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:48,753
<i>But Chip never did come back.</i>

500
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:52,985
<i>He became the new, young,</i>
<i>funny kid on ABC's</i> The Middle.

501
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,300
Wow! This is just a whole
bunch of loud garbage!

502
00:20:57,325 --> 00:21:02,325
