1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:05,037
 it seems today
that all you see 

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:08,173
 is violence in movies
and sex on tv 

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,877
 but where are those
good old-fashioned values 

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,880
 on which we used to rely?

5
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:18,283
 lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,653
 lucky there's a man
who positively can do 

7
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,122
 all the things that make us

8
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,890
 laugh and cry

9
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:30,095
 he's... A...
Fam... Ily... Guy! 

10
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,301
Peter, come on,
get dressed.

11
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,703
We're late
for church.

12
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,238
I don't want to
go to church.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,974
I always feel like that
priest has it in for me.

14
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:43,976
Body of christ.

15
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,978
Body of christ.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,046
Butt of christ.

17
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,381
Aah! Lois,
trade me.
No.

18
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,718
You're not wearing that
to church, are you?

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,919
What? Yeah. Why not?

20
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,587
This is what
I always wear.

21
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:56,889
She's right, man.

22
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,090
It's Sunday. Get noticed.

23
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:00,159
I'll be in the car.

24
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,096
I'm getting tired of you wearing
the same thing every day.

25
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,898
Look, that shirt's got
a hole in it.

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,734
I'd like to point out that jesus
wore the same thing every day.

27
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,103
And you didn't hear alice
giving him a hard time about it.

28
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,504
Who?
Wasn't that her name?

29
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,739
Let's just get to church.

30
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,107
And afterward,
you're going to the mall

31
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,341
To go clothes shopping.

32
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,876
Well, you're
coming with me.

33
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,179
Last time I tried shopping
without you, it was a disaster.

34
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,613
Hey, I'm home.

35
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,582
I got groceries.
You what?

36
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,917
Yeah, I was driving past there,

37
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,752
And we were out
of some stuff, so I...

38
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,954
You listen to me,
you son of a bitch!

39
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,923
I've got one thing
in this lifetime!

40
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,691
One thing.
(groaning)

41
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,694
You always say I never
do anything around here.

42
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,098
Yeah, I like saying that more
than I like you doing things.

43
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,133
Dad, I got the rest
from the car. Where...?

44
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:42,634
Chris, run!
You were right!

45
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,869
She didn't appreciate it!

46
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,105
Oh, crap!

47
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,739
Chris:
Ow!

48
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:48,907
That's right.

49
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,776
I do groceries.

50
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,316
All right, even though
we just walked in,

51
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,252
And this whole place is one
hallway, let's consult the map.

52
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,920
Okay.

53
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,255
Uh-oh.

54
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,524
(gunshot)

55
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,096
I'll bet we can find you
some new clothes in here.

56
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,932
Peter:
Hey, lois, are you sure
this place is for men?

57
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,167
Yes, peter, it's for everyone.

58
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,569
Really? 'cause this-this
kind of looks like a dress.

59
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,805
Peter, it's fine.
Come on out.

60
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,908
Ha! You gaybo!

61
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,645
Hang on, peter.

62
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,947
I'm gonna go look for a couple
things for me in here.

63
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,149
I'll be right back.

64
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,650
Okay, lois, I'll
be right here,

65
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,186
Standing uncomfortably close to
the unnecessary piano player

66
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,921
In the middle of the mall.

67
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,823


68
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,992
So, what's it like
now that you've made it?

69
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,293
Did you ever have
a bank account

70
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,961
Full of pedestrians'
disinterested smiles?

71
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,496
You're amazing.

72
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,032
I'm gonna sit indian-style
on top of your piano.

73
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,103
There aren't enough verses
in any song I could write

74
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,939
That would express how much
hatred I have in my heart.

75
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,241
You talk like a book.

76
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,144
Hey, lois,
how about we try sears?

77
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,345
They got good stuff.

78
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,114
Peter, nobody's been
in sears for decades.

79
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:03,782
Oh, come on.
When I was a boy,

80
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,617
We always used to go
clothes shopping at sears.

81
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,252
Trust me. They'll have
everything I need.

82
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:13,992
What the hell happened here?

83
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,427
Look out!

84
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,731
(muffled speaking)

85
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,833
He wants to know
who you are.

86
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,136
We seek clothes
for the cold times.

87
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,138
(muffled speaking)

88
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,074
He says he'll take you to
the clothes for herbs and meat.

89
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,709
Well, we can probably come up

90
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,644
With some herbs
and meat, right, peter?

91
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,912
Peter?

92
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,514
I'm with them now.

93
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,015
No girls allowed.

94
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,318
(tires squealing)

95
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,324
See, lois, now,
this is more like it.

96
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,359
What the hell?
Why won't this button?

97
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,994
It's the same size
I always get.

98
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,163
Maybe you put on a
few pounds, sweetie.

99
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,098
Lois, I weigh the same
293 pounds today

100
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,499
That I weighed
in grade school.

101
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,069
Perhaps it's this lump
on the side of your neck, sir.

102
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,670
Oh, my god, peter!

103
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,405
How long have you
had that thing?

104
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,707
I-I don't know.

105
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,842
We got to go see
dr. Hartman right away.

106
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,677
Oh, my god, what if
it's something serious?

107
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,912
It's all right,
it's all right.

108
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,047
We'll be in good hands
with dr. Hartman.

109
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,016
He handled
my reassignment surgery.

110
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:14,253
I think, emotionally, I've
always been a lizard, you know?

111
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,887
And now, I feel
comfortable finally

112
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,189
In my leathery,
scaly skin.

113
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,790
Kids, if you need me,

114
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,660
I'll be on the wall making
rapid, darting glances.

115
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,198
Is this just to get out
of my parents' visit?

116
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,399
No.

117
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,600
(doorbell rings)

118
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,669
Babs:
Hello!

119
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,907
No,    <i>you'</i>stupid!

120
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,442
Oh, hello, griffins.

121
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,044
What can I help
you with today?

122
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:42,581
Dr. Hartman, peter has a huge
lump growing on his neck.

123
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,082
Mrs. Griffin,
that's called a "head."

124
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,617
I've been fooled
by that one before.

125
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,319
Well, will you
take a look at it?

126
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,954
I think it might
be a tumor.

127
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,289
Okay, let's
have a look.

128
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,892
Oh, yes, it appears
that there is a...

129
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,060
Great rack, by the way.

130
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,328
Thank you.

131
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,963
Well, thank grandma
griffin, really.

132
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,666
It appears you have
a subcutaneous vestigial twin

133
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,134
Growing on your neck.

134
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,335
What is that?

135
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,836
Well, it's
an incomplete twin

136
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,638
That never developed
into a fully-formed person

137
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,074
But still exists as a growth
feeding off your body.

138
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:09,074
Now, hold still.

139
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,110
I'm just gonna give you
a little topical anesthetic,

140
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,145
And we'll have
a closer look.

141
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,016
(high-pitched voice):
Hi, everybody!

142
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,951
Aah! What the
hell is that?!

143
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,920
Oh, my god!
It's a little me!

144
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,022
Well, it looks as if he's more
fully formed than we thought.

145
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,658
Wow, your wife
is gorgeous!

146
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,093
Is that a foot?

147
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,294
Almost!

148
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,629
This is awesome!

149
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,197
Finally, I'll have an
interesting silhouette

150
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,700
For the beginning of
my spoken-word jazz.

151
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,336
(stand-up bass plays
slow jazz)

152
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,338
I left...

153
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,340
My poem...

154
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,408
At home.

155
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,950
Male announcer (over tv):
We now return to <i>quantum creep.</i>

156
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,019


157
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,956
Al, what year is it?

158
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,891
1972.
Cool.

159
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,561
I'm gonna go show my penis
to some kids.

160
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:05,030
Hey, dad. How'd it
go at the hospital?

161
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,065
Kids, remember
how when you were little,

162
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,533
You always wanted
a neck uncle?

163
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,335
No.
Well, now
you got one!

164
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,636
(screaming)

165
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:12,971
What is that thing?!

166
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,706
This is my vestigial twin.

167
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,007
I named him chip.

168
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,676
You know, like
"chip off the old neck."

169
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,811
I like to poke him
'cause it makes him happy,

170
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,980
And I feel it a little bit
in my nads.

171
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,549
(both giggle)

172
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,084
Well, keep that freakish thing
under wraps.

173
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,053
I don't want it
cramping my style

174
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,454
While I'm macking on toddlers.

175
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,094
See you around, bitch.

176
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,363
You know, lois, a lot of times
you go into someone's house,

177
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,265
And it's just a house,
but you can tell

178
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,901
This is a home
by all the love here.

179
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,202
Aw!
Aw!
Aw!
Aw!

180
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,072
Peter, this seems unnatural,
and, quite frankly, dangerous.

181
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,508
Hey, you must be the owner
of that prius outside.

182
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,009
Thanks for saving
the world.

183
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,244
He gets it.

184
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,013
He gets what we prius
owners are trying to do.

185
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,082
Wow, the world
is such a cool place.

186
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,084
There's so much
I want to do and see!

187
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,620
Oh, he's such a great
energy to have around.

188
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,723
Ah, chip, I am gonna show you
all kinds of cool stuff.

189
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:08,059
My hot wheels, my lawn darts,
even my new musket.

190
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,095
(rapid, rhythmic whirring)

191
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,963
Peter, what the
hell are you doing?

192
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,099
Lois, I thought
I heard a noise downstairs.

193
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,600
Go stall 'em for 20 minutes

194
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,736
And pray that it's not
too damp in here.

195
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,704
(strums chord)

196
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,440
Man, how do you know
so many songs?

197
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,408
Oh, when you're trapped
under a layer of fat,

198
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,877
A muffled folk song
is like manna from heaven.

199
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,945
Give me a c.

200
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,747
(strums chord)

201
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,716
 michael, row
the boat ashore 

202
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,953
 hallelujah

203
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,156
Both:
 michael, row the boat ashore

204
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,059
 hallelujah

205
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,295
Sister, help
to trim the sail.

206
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,498
 sister, help
to trim the sail 

207
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,501
 hallelujah

208
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,903
 sister, help to trim...

209
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:52,938
(roaring)

210
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,306
Aah! Run!

211
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,876
No, peter, gently stroke
his snout counterclockwise.

212
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,814
Wow, it's working.

213
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,183
There's a universal language
for all creatures,

214
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,785
And it's called love.

215
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,487
Now, how about
that river jordan?

216
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:12,090
 river jordan
is deep and wide 

217
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,026
 hallelujah

218
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,261
Join us, bear!

219
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:19,364
All:
 milk and honey
on the other side 

220
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,934
 hallelujah.

221
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,736
(strums ending chord)

222
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,940
Good morning, boys.

223
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,809
What's in store
for today?

224
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,978
Well, I thought we'd start
with a vigorous power walk

225
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,513
Around the neighborhood.

226
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,282
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I was thinking
we would just watch <i>dr. Oz</i>

227
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,117
And eat cold cuts
off our stomach.

228
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,556
Those people ain't taking
good care of themselves.

229
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,858
What?! But there's so much
to do and experience!

230
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,959
Did you know

231
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,995
That the quahog museum
has an interactive display

232
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,863
On the history
of the garment district?

233
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,498
Oh, look, chip, chip,
slow down, all right?

234
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,066
You know, just because
everything's new to you

235
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,035
Doesn't mean
you have to do it all at once.

236
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,070
Peter, where's your sense
of fun and adventure?

237
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,406
You're starting to sound
like a stick-in-the-mud.

238
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,041
Well, that stuff
sounds exhausting.

239
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,510
I'm just being honest,
like george washington.

240
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,079
George, did you chop down
our cherry tree?

241
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,215
I cannot tell
a lie. Yes.

242
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,884
And what is this pamphlet
I found under your bed

243
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,719
Called "the boston he party?"

244
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,454
Not mine.

245
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,361
Wow! Is there any
better time in the world

246
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,530
Than 11:00 a.M.
On a Wednesday?

247
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,333
You already have two days
of hard work under your belt,

248
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,335
And there's so much
more work to come.

249
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,537
Look, I'm trying to get
this stuff done here.

250
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,773
Griffin, did you finish
those purchasing reports?

251
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,374
Oh, that voice!

252
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,909
It's like god sneezing!

253
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,210
What the hell is this?

254
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,012
They found a guy
on my neck.

255
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:41,012
Hello there.

256
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,783
I've never met a supervisor,
slash supermodel before.

257
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,351
Do you like crab?

258
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,054
There's a knockout crab place
right around the corner.

259
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,255
What the hell are you doing?

260
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,257
I'm using my knowledge
of the local food scene

261
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,492
To get this woman
to go to bed with me.

262
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,696
Well, now we know.

263
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,131
I can taste
what he eats.

264
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,269
What are we watching?
Oh, it's just a tennis match.

265
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,071
So this is tennis!

266
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,372
(racket hits ball)
wow!

267
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:12,310
(to tennis balls hitting):
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

268
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,745
Man (on tv):
15-love.

269
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:14,980
That was just one point?!

270
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,949
Federer and hastings are known
for their long rallies.

271
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,084
Federer to serve.

272
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:23,922
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow! Wow!

273
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,991
Wow! Wow!

274
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,928
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

275
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,429
Wow!

276
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,631
15 all.

277
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,932
And this is just
the first game

278
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,101
Of the first round
of a three-week tournament?

279
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,469
Yay!

280
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,070
(sighs)
this is more painful
than sitting

281
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,439
Through those
parent-teacher-cheetah meetings.

282
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,775
So, in short, your kids
are all doing great.

283
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,143
Keep reading to
them every night,

284
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,445
And I think we're gonna
have a great year.

285
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,980
So unless there
are any questions,

286
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,081
Thank you all
for coming.

287
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,283
Uh, yeah, I noticed
the hot lunch menu

288
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,085
Doesn't feature
any gazelle.

289
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,320
(others groan loudly)

290
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,155
I'll bring that
up to the board.

291
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,491
Yeah. See, I-I heard
that last year,

292
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,527
(chuckling): And...
Here we are again.

293
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,930


294
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,532
Listen, doc, is
there any way

295
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,467
You can have this thing
on my neck removed?

296
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,836
Well, mr. Griffin, your organs
and his are intertwined.

297
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,338
That would be a highly
dangerous procedure.

298
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,706
You could die.

299
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,441
On the other hand,
if you live,

300
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,309
I'll let you pick any prize
off that shelf.

301
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,011
Even the tiny
pinball machine?

302
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,713
Oh, that-that shouldn't
have been up there.

303
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,815
Look, doc, you got to do
the procedure, all right?

304
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,116
I-I don't care
if I die.

305
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,851
I mean, maybe in
my next life,

306
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,787
I'll come back as an
air bag or something.

307
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,625
(rhythmic ticking)

308
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,061
It's okay. It's okay.
Peter's got you.

309
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,195
Don't you worry.

310
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,963
Everything's gonna
be all right.

311
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,167
Is my wife okay?
No, the ski boots
that was in the back

312
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,202
Flew up and chopped
her head off.

313
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,572
You can turn your blinker
off now; it's very annoying.

314
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,211


315
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,522
Nurse, have somebody
fix that clock.

316
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:05,724
It's very distracting.

317
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,892
All right,
let's get this started.

318
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,862


319
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,931
(machine beeping)

320
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,601
All right, halfway done.

321
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,236
Time for a break.

322
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,110
 I hate myself

323
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,245
 for loving you

324
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,947
 can't break free

325
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,449
 from the things
that you do... 

326
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,789
Oh, god, I'm
so nervous.

327
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,125
Thank god stewie's too
little to understand.

328
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,627
Look at him over there,
playing that board game.

329
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,129
Ah, three.

330
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,197
Okay, one, two...

331
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,066
Sorry!

332
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:51,269
Announcer:
<i>Sorry! The board game</i>
<i>that teaches you to be a dick.</i>

333
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,073
Dr. Hartman, is everything
all right with my dad?

334
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,408
Griffins, I'm
afraid we lost him.

335
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,410
What?!
Oh, my god!

336
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,212
Hey, guys.
Oh, there he is.

337
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,248
It worked!
I'm free at last!

338
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,316
But what about chip?
Where's chip?

339
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,486
Hey, everybody,
look who's walking!

340
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,288
Others:
Chip!

341
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,924
Oh, chip,
I'm so glad you're okay.

342
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,726
Yeah, and I'm
okay, too.

343
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,128
So, uh, you know, chip,
now that you're a free man,

344
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,963
This is a chance
for you to go out

345
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,498
And make a real life
for yourself someplace.

346
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,666
I'll tell you what,

347
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,234
Anywhere you want to
go, I'll fedex you.

348
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,069
What are you
talking about, peter?

349
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,071
Chip is part of our family.

350
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,940
He's staying with us.
What?!

351
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,942
Yay!
Yay!
Awesome!

352
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,011
Hey, hey, dad?
Yeah, I'm done.

353
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,846
Can you pick me up?

354
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,915
Oh, that's okay;
I have a book.

355
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,123
Oh, hey, peter.

356
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,491
Lois, where's the couch?

357
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,127
Chip redecorated the room
to improve the feng shui.

358
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,096
He said our old furniture was
blocking the flow of energy.

359
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,632
I had my life's
fart savings in that couch!

360
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,101
And where are the drapes?
Chip took them

361
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,504
To make play clothes
for the children.
What?!

362
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,372
(chip and others laughing)

363
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,107
(laughter continues)

364
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,311
Oh, hey, peter.
You're home.

365
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,146
Hi, dad!
Hi, daddy.

366
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,681
We dug a lake
for this!

367
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,115
All:
Whoa!

368
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,118
Come out of that water at once!

369
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,620
Gosh, isn't chip
wonderful?

370
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,222
No, he's not wonderful,
lois; he's annoying.

371
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:20,058
I don't get why everyone's
so in love with that guy.

372
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,227
What's so great about him?
Well, to be honest,

373
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,463
The same thing that used to be
so great about you.

374
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,131
What? What are you
talking about?

375
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,466
Just that when
you were younger,

376
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,202
You were as passionate
and full of life as him.

377
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,172
(high-pitched):
Hey, boys,

378
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,441
Catch me
if you can!

379
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,645
Oh, crap!
I didn't realize they had bikes!

380
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,981
(groans)
what are they gonna do
when they catch me?

381
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,983
Oh, boy, I got a
back-of-the-head punch coming,

382
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,384
I just know it!

383
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,754


384
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,093
Lois:
 it seems today
that all you see 

385
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,562
What the hell?
 is violence in movies

386
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,397
 and sex on tv

387
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,101
 but where are those
good old-fashioned values 

388
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,203
 on which we used to rely?

389
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,438
What the...? What the
hell is going on here?

390
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,207
You're singing our
song without me?

391
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,109
Oh, sorry, peter,
we couldn't find you.

392
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,211
Do you want to sing
your part, peter?

393
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,879
Go ahead.

394
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,115
 but where are
the fashioned 

395
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,716
 good fashion...

396
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,286
I don't want to!
(sobbing)

397
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:25,023


398
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,724
I tell you,
chip is making my life

399
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,126
A living hell,
you guys.

400
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,194
Remind me again, chip is
that african kid you adopted?

401
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,530
No, that was chocolate chip.
We gave him back to kenya.

402
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:35,099
But I can't take it anymore.
I got to get rid of him.

403
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,101
Well, what are
you gonna do?
I don't know yet,

404
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,369
But I'll come up
with something.

405
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:39,971
After all, I'm the guy
who invented

406
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,273
"choose your own adventure
or have pie in bed."

407
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,409
I picked the pie again.

408
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,477


409
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,418
Hey, welcome back to
the    <i>mikey tony magnanimous h,</i>

410
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,920
Where real people get
magnanimous about real things.

411
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,456
This week's real thing--
hey, native americans,

412
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,458
If I saw you
on the street begging,

413
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,427
I'd throw a buck
in your moccasin.

414
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,128
Next week's magnanimous thing--

415
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,131
I'm wearing this yellow
bracelet. You're welcome.

416
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,300
(growling)
peter, what the
hell is that thing?

417
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,302
It's a dingo.
I named him bingo.

418
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,471
If you can't have fun
with that, you're crazy.

419
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,539
(growling)

420
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,674
Hey, peter.

421
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,109
Wh-what's that?

422
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,645
Oh, he's gonna turn you
into a pile on joe's lawn.

423
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,680
What?!
Here, let's play
steak catch.

424
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:23,982
Oh, boy, I got it!

425
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,149
Hey, back to you, peter!

426
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,018
Ah, cool! Steak catch!

427
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,287
I'm gonna use my one
steak-in-the-pants time-out.

428
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,756
(growling)
aah! No!
Not me! Not me!

429
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,124
Attack him! Aah!

430
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,728
Hey, um, it's 3:00 p.M.
Should I give up on breakfast?

431
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,863
Aah! Brian!

432
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,164
Browser history--
clear it!

433
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,935
Peter, that dingo was meant
to eat me, wasn't it?

434
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,703
Why would you do that?

435
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,039
Because my life was fine
before you showed up.

436
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,608
My family liked me,
and-and I didn't feel bad

437
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,276
About not ever doing new stuff.

438
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,879
Well, I never asked to
grow out of your neck.

439
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,949
My life was better
before I met you, too!

440
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,818
You're a terrible brother,
husband and father.

441
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,287
I'm out of here,
and you could go to hell!

442
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,157
Wow, what a nice day out!
Look! A rainbow!

443
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,825
I did it.

444
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,060
He's gone.

445
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:12,663
Just as easy as
the creation of techno music.

446
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,632
Wait a minute,
what key are we in?

447
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,667
No, no, no, no,
no, none of that.

448
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:20,271


449
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,141
Oh, hey, peter.
Where's chip?

450
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,076
I haven't seen him
all day.

451
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,811
He likes to yell out
"good luck!"

452
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,546
After they read
each lottery number.

453
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,081
He's gone.
I threw him out.

454
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,382
You what?
No!

455
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,184
Peter, how could you?

456
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,253
Whoa, whoa, what are you all
coming down on me for?

457
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,822
Meg throws away people who come
out of her body all the time,

458
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:38,856
Nobody says nothing.

459
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,925
Peter, chip was
a part of our family.

460
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,160
And he's so little.

461
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,062
He can get hurt
out there on his own.

462
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,830
We got to go find him.

463
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,999
We should look for him
in the ball pit at mcdonald's.

464
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:50,068
You can just leave me there;
I'll conduct the search.

465
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,003
Meg's right!
Come on, kids,

466
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,439
Let's go find chip
and bring him back!

467
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,941
You guys do whatever you want.
I got stuff to do, anyway.

468
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,943
I got to get ready
for my bar mitzvah.

469
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,912
 baruch atah adonai

470
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,581
 I want fancy things
like my friend ephraim 

471
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,116
 I want the newest
ten-speed bicycle 

472
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,019
 that I will ride once, but
then I will call my parents 

473
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,887
 and have them come get me

474
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,057
 I want to swim in the pool
but only with my shirt on 

475
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,126
 I want to lose
my virginity at 24 

476
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,694
 but tell everyone
I was 16... 

477
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,964


478
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,668
Ah, crap, I'm out of beer.

479
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,038
Great. I have to walk
down these stairs

480
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,941
The one day I wore heels.

481
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:30,975
(yelling)

482
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,410
(screaming)

483
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,945
(grunting in pain)

484
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,113
Son of a bitch!

485
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,914
I think I broke my leg!

486
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,484
(grunting)

487
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,253
There's no way I'm gonna make it
back up those stairs.

488
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,688
(phone ringing)

489
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,357
Nope.

490
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,294
Peter? It's me, chip.

491
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,297
Listen, I... I'm sorry
for the mean things I said.

492
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,566
Help!
Peter?

493
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,670
Holy smokes!
Peter, are you okay?

494
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,172
These books was already
down here!

495
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,540
I'm not a nerd!

496
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,642
Oh, my god!

497
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,311
We got to get this leg set
and get you to the hospital!

498
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,747
Oh, cool. That's the place
with all the <i>ghostbusters</i> cars!

499
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,049
(grunts)

500
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,026
(grunting)

501
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,564
(loud grunting)

502
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,600
(high-pitched
flatulence)
(giggles)

503
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,936
If you had only done that
while you were here,

504
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,337
We wouldn't be in this mess.

505
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,010
Mr. Griffin,
you're a lucky man.

506
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:42,113
If it weren't for chip here,
you might have lost your leg.

507
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:43,781
The bad news is,
we did an x-ray,

508
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,983
And your body is full
of a spooky skeleton man.

509
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,886
Gosh, chip, I don't
know how to thank you.

510
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,188
No problem, peter.

511
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,156
You would have done
the same thing for me.

512
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,992
You know, chip, lois
was right about you.

513
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,627
You are special.

514
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,697
You've got all the sense of
wonder that I somehow lost.

515
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,966
I got so used to watching tv

516
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,001
And looking for tiny
jean fibers in my nuts,

517
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,904
I forgot there's a whole
world out there to experience.

518
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,673
Thank you for
showing me that.

519
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,341
As far as I'm concerned,

520
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,577
You're a permanent
part of our family now.

521
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,246
Well, that sure is nice of you,
peter, but...

522
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,648
There's a big old world
out there.

523
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,151
I want to go out
and experience it for myself.

524
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,019
All:
Aw!
Why?

525
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:25,356
Well, I'm sorry to see you go,
but I understand.

526
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,658
Oh, we're gonna miss you, chip.

527
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:35,099
I'm too tough to cry,
but I'm gonna miss you, too.

528
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,005
Safe travels, buddy,
and keep in touch.

529
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,206
I will!

530
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,742
Whee!

531
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,410
Good-bye, chip!
Bye!

532
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,613
Come back soon, okay?

533
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,448
Patrick stewart:
<i>But chip never did come back.</i>

534

Wow! This is just a whole
bunch of loud garbage!
