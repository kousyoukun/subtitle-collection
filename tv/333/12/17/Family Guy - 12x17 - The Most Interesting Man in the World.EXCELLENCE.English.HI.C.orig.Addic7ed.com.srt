Peter  和柚子弄
Peter, jamming yourself into

142
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:14,419
不算是出轨
a grapefruit is not an affair.

143
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:21,659
看  这有个人类小孩

穿着Stewie的背带裤睡着了
Asleep in Stewie's overalls.

145
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:25,730
Peter  拜托你走开

146
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:31,102
好极了  吵醒门铃了
Great. We woke up the doorbell.

147
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,872
我想我们在公园里弄错了

我自己回家的
I just got home myself.

154
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,650
让我老公管事
I left my husband in charge,

155
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,986
显然犯了个严重的错误
which was obviously a terrible mistake.

156
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,122
太感谢你了
Thank you so much.

157
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:53,124
我和那个爹一起泡澡了

你通过考验了
You passed the test.

162

你真的爱Stewie
You really do love Stewie.

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,001
现在  你说我们都坐下
Now, what do you say we all sit down

164
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:05,136
看怪怪AL Yankovic纪录片怎么样（恶搞歌手）
and watch this Weird Al Yankovic documentary?

165
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,806
叫难以忽视的牙齿
（环保纪录片 难以忽视的真相）
It's called An Inconvenient Tooth.

166
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,008
你什么毛病  Peter
What's wrong with you, Peter?!

167
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,376
Lois  对不起
Lois, I'm sorry.

168
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,044
你到底怎么能把
How the hell can you possibly

169
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:14,379
另一个小孩当成Stewie
mistake another baby for Stewie?!

170
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,014
冷静  Lois
Now, calm down, Lois.

171
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:17,449
这样说出的话不是你的本意
You're gonna say something you don't mean.

172
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:19,984
才不  就是本意  你这个白痴
Oh, no, I'm not! You're an idiot!

173
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,220
你不是那个意思
You don't mean that.

174
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:24,422
我收到那个爹的Facebook好友请求了
I already got a Facebook friend request from the dad.

175
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,024
奇怪吧
Is that weird?

176
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:28,393
Peter  我忍了你20年
Peter, I have put up with your nonsense for 20 years,

177
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:29,994
但今天你太过分了
but today you crossed a line.

178
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,263
你把一个无助的小孩留在公园里
You left a helpless baby in a public park.

179
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,899
只有白痴才做得出这种事
And that's something only an idiot would do!

180
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:38,036
我不是白痴
I'm not an idiot.

181
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:42,974
我想我们在公园里弄错了
Hey, I think there was a mix-up at the park.

182
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,459
继续播放《有真实人类情感的

184
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:54,229
很不错啊  LaRusso
You're all right, LaRusso!

185
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:56,832
你刚才打算废了我
You just tried to cripple me!

186
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,689
我不想听起来像女人
I hate to sound like every

187
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,169
但我好沮丧
woman ever, but I'm depressed.

188
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:02,504
不要接话  不要接话
Don't engage. Don't engage.

189
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:03,905
为什么  艹
Why? Damn it!

190
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,841
Lois说我是白痴  那又怎么样
Lois called me an idiot. So?

191
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,193
怎么样  我还没说她
So, I don't tell her all the

192
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:08,376
那些讨厌的事呢
bad things about herself.

193
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:10,078
像她背上的痣
Like how the mole on her back

194
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:12,280
大小形状变个不停
is changing shape and size really quickly.

195
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:13,915
做白痴不是最糟的事  Peter
Being dumb isn't the worst thing, Peter.

196
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,851
起码你不是旁边隔间
At least you're not two foreign guys

197
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:18,120
说话超响的那两个外国人
talking too loud in the next booth.

198

202
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:27,095
说得对  Belgard
You said it, Belgard.

203
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,397
看来今晚我们要
Looks like you and me will have to make hands

228
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:13,942
从小时候起  我浪费了

229
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:15,410
许多机会
ever since I was a kid.

230
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:18,831
嗨小子  到我车里来

232
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:23,151
不  妈妈说不行
No, my mom says I shouldn't.

233
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
本地男孩获得终身免费糖果供应

234
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:32,198
嗨小子  到我车里来

238
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:47,409
Stella  你周四去芝加哥

241
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:59,421
打了12分钟了
a 12-minute round.

242
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:01,957
为什么总要打到死为止

Angela  如果你需要人出差

Griffin  你先告诉我你穿着裤子
Griffin, I'm not gonna look over there

246
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,664
否则我不会往那看
until you first assure me you've got pants on.

247
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:12,334
没用标示写在墙上的就不算是规定
It's not a rule unless there's a sign on the wall.

248
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:14,369
我打赢了官司  好吧
I won that court case. Fine.

249
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:16,104
那你愿意为公司
So you'd be willing to take that trip

250
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,439
到芝加哥出差了
to Chicago for the company?

251
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:18,807
对  你知道  我刚才在说

252
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:20,375
我应该开阔视野
I need to broaden my horizons.

253
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:22,077
你看  我老婆认为我是个白痴
You see, my wife thinks I'm an idiot.

254
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:23,238
她总是让我觉得自己
She's always making me feel

255
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:24,246
渺小  无足轻重
small and insignificant.

256
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,348
像John Goodman的心跳
Like John Goodman's heartbeat.

257
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:30,610
亲爱的  我左边奶奶里的
Honey? My inside left boob

258
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,454
胃又发出那个奇怪的动静了
stomach did that thing again.

259
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:34,022
你说心脏？
You mean your heart?

260
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:36,524
呃  我不懂那些
Um, I don't know about any of that,

261
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,660
但我想应该吃饭了
but I think I should eat something.

262

先生们  谢谢你们到来

但我明晚才走
But I'm here till tomorrow night.

270
00:10:57,914 --> 00:10:59,414
该干些什么呢
What am I supposed to do?

271
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:01,116
出去走走  探索芝加哥
Get out there and explore Chicago, Peter.

272
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,351
这是世界上最棒的城市的之一
It's one of the great cities of the world.

273

There's museums, a symphony, a Lyric Opera.

274
00:11:06,222 --> 00:11:07,522
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

275
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,391
你说“小鸡时装秀”吗
Did you say "chicken fashion show"?

276
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:11,026
没有  哦

277
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,194
但其他那些  听起来
But that-that other stuff, they all sound like

278
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:16,197
可以帮我扩展视野
the kind of things I could do to expand my horizons.

279
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Wow.

280
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:22,103
芝加哥：旧金山的珍宝
  Chicago: "The San Francisco Treat."

281
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:24,172
除了跳岩洞  我从来没有体验过
I haven't felt this sense of limitless adventure

282
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:26,174
这么无拘无束的冒险了
since I went cave jumping.

283
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,994
跳咯
Here we go!

284
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:31,798
我来这儿谁都不知道
I told no one what I was doing today!

285
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:37,983
唉  我算是芝加哥
Man, I'm, like, the fifth most

286
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:39,806
第五漂亮的女人了

287
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:48,281
你好  欢迎来到博物馆
Hi. Welcome to the museum.

288
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:49,949
谢谢  我想先问清楚
Thanks. Just to be clear,

289
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:51,451
我应该摸遍这些东西  对吗
I should touch everything, right?

290
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:53,152
不  请什么都别摸
No, please don't touch anything.

291
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:55,455
对不起  这是我第一次来成年人的博物馆
Sorry, it's my first time at an adult museum.

292
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,256
我摸海星摸习惯了
I'm used to petting the starfishes.

293
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,325
那么  也许我们的语音导游能帮到你
Well, maybe you'd find our audio tour helpful.

294
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,626

边吃边讲
eating through most of this.

301
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:16,209
对  要这个
Yeah. This one.

302
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:19,412
哎呀
Ah, man,

303
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,280
香肠真好吃
that's good sausage.

304
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:22,548
哟  不好意思
Oops. Excuse me.

305
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,684
不管了  这是Toulouse-Lautrec的
Anyways, this is At the Moulin Rouge

306
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:26,152
红磨坊
by Toulouse-Lautrec.

307
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:28,154
呃  是1890年代的
Uh, it's from the 1890s.

308
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:31,858
那个  他是个侏儒  但画得像正常人一样
Now, he was a midge, but he painted like a normal.

309
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:35,729
这是个完全由
Now, here is a naked chick

310
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:37,530
大理石做成的裸体妞
made completely out of marble.

311
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:39,699
我奇怪——相信你们也在想——
I got to wonder-- I'm sure you do, too--

312
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,142
他们刻她下身的时候
how this thing didn't crack

313
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:42,502
这东西
when they were carving out

314
00:12:42,536 --> 00:12:44,670
怎么没裂掉呢
her downstairs business.

315
00:12:44,705 --> 00:12:47,607
阴道刻得太好了
He did a great job with the vagina.

316

这是一幅Salvador Dalí的画
Here's a picture by this guy Salvador Dalí.

317
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,310
我告诉你  这家伙
This guy, I'm telling you,

318
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,146
可是他妈的疯球了
was a freakin' whack-a-doodle.

319
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:56,045
哇  谁能想到在博物馆
Wow, who knew you could learn

320
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:57,350
能学到这么多
so much at a museum?

321
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:59,185
这还只是在芝加哥
And this is only Chicago.

322
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:00,623
从现在开始  我要自告奋勇
From now on, I'm gonna volunteer

323
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:01,687
参加每一次出差
for every business trip,

324
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:04,423
去看看外面所有的好东西
and see all the great stuff that's out there.

325
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,886
继续播放Janeane Garofalo（相声演员）
We now return to Janeane Garofalo

326
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,555
和Mark Rufflo共同出演的Garofaruffalo
and Mark Ruffalo in Garofaruffalo.

327
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,823
关掉  Chris
Turn it off, Chris.

328
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:12,758
我连知道那是什么的兴趣都没有
I don't even want to know what that is.

329
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:15,161
你们爸爸回来了
Your father has returned.

330
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:16,729
爸爸  哦  Peter
Dad! Oh, Peter!

331
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:18,464
出差怎么样
How were all your business trips?

332
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:20,232
哦  卓越非凡  Chris
Oh, exemplary, Chris.

333
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:22,768
我不知道那两个词什么意思（是一个词）
I don't understand what either of those words mean.

334
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:24,670
其中一个是你
One of them was "Chris."

335
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:26,405
Peter  你看起来不一样了
Peter, you seem... different.

336
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,442
很对  Lois  我现在活在精神世界了
That's right, Lois; I live the life of the mind now.

337
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:32,411
我的大脑受到了抽象而深刻的知识洗礼
My brain is awash with theorems and profundity

338
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:33,897
对此我能高谈阔论
and abstractions that I can

339
00:14:33,897 --> 00:14:35,348
滔滔不绝
pontificate upon at length.

340
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,416
Brian是只汪汪叫的猫
Brian's a woof-cat!

341
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:40,186
Peter  你听起来好深刻
Peter, you sound so refined.

342
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,254
你  有文化了？
Are you... intelligent now?

343
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,357
然  意思是“是”
Affirmative.That means "yes."

344
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:46,592
这让你愉悦吗  是的  Peter
Does that please you? It does, Peter.

345
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:48,227
对  应该如此
Well, it should.

346
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:50,863
毕竟  知识是最强力的催情剂
After all, knowledge is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

347
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:52,865
我们是否要告辞以行私事
Shall we away for relations?

348
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,168
我不知道你在说什么  不过开干吧
I'm not sure what you're saying, but let's hump!

349
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:58,070
然  然
Affirmative, affirmative,

350
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,240
然  哦天哪  然
affirmative... Oh, my God, affirmative!

351
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:03,576
哇  Peter  太棒了
Wow, Peter, that was great!

352
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,945
是的  抱歉我先到达了
It was. Sorry I "arrived" early.

353
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:07,546
没关系
That's okay.

354
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:08,981
抱歉弄脏床罩
And sorry about the bedspread.

355
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:11,584
大概有一周到达的量（come-cum-精液）
That was about a week's worth of arrive.

356
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:20,029
妈  爸  电视坏了
Mom, Dad, the TV's broken!

357
00:15:20,234 --> 00:15:22,568
实际上  Chris  我把电视弄走了
Actually, Chris, I got rid of our television.

358
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:25,138
这是我们的新书架  我想你会发现
This is our new bookshelf, and I think you'll find

359
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:28,207
这里的频道比任何电视都多
it has more channels than any TV we've ever owned.

360
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:30,243
我想看行尸走肉
I want to watch The Walking Dead! 

361
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:32,040
那么我给你读

我要看杰茜驾到

364
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:37,083
那你会喜欢简爱的

365
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:38,923
在罗切斯特的桑菲尔德庄园
who felt quite the new girl

366
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:40,987
他就像是杰茜
at Rochester's Thornfield Hall.

367
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,789
权力的游戏呢
How about Game of Thrones? 

368
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:45,024
不用看那个  我会给你读

369
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:46,692
权力的游戏
Game of Thrones.

370
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:48,961
哦  这个家里终于又有一个读书人了

384
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:14,253
这是什么  橡木
What is this, oak?

385
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:16,189
我觉得都不是橡木哦
Oh, I don't even think it's oak!

386
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:17,657
Peter  我还是不敢相信你
Peter, I can't get over the way

387

你的转变如此大
you've transformed yourself.

388

你怎么做到的
How'd you do it?

389
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,328
Lois  一部分来自书本
Well, Lois, some of it came from books,

390
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:23,863
一部分来自博物馆
some came from museums,

391
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:26,299
诚实地说  主要来自旅行
and, honestly, a lot of it just came from travel.

392
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,734
打扰了  我要租车
Hey, excuse me, I need to rent a car.

393
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,671
最好是广播只放NPR的
Preferably one where the radio is stuck on NPR.

394

沿海  高端
Coastal and superior.

398
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:43,249
我从来不知道悄悄话般的声音能这么聪明
I never knew whisper-talking was so smart.

399
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:45,985
怎么支付租车费  先生
And how will you be paying for your rental, sir?

400
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,688
我用故事来支付  我父亲虐待我的故事
I will pay you with stories of my abusive father

401
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,289
配上不搭调的长笛伴奏
set to dissonant flute.

402
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:54,293
他第一次喝醉酒回家时  我七岁
I was seven when he first came home drunk.

403
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:58,231
孩子应该在床上安睡  而不是床底
A child should sleep on his bed, not under it.

404
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:02,368
嘿  你在听什么
Hey, what are you listening to?

405
00:17:02,402 --> 00:17:04,237
哦  抱歉  我在听梵语
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm learning Sanskrit.

406
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:05,805
你知道  古老的语言
You know, an ancient tongue

407
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,874
和年轻的口舌一样诱惑（语言-口舌-tongue）
can be as titillating as a young one.

408
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:09,675
Peter  怎么回事  自从这几次出差回来
Peter, what gives? Ever since you had

409
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,644
你就表现的很奇怪
all those business trips, you've been acting weird.

410
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:13,433
怜悯我吧  在熟悉的地方
Pity a man in familiar places

411
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,248
却格格不入
who yet feels like a stranger.

412
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:16,481
你  就是你这混蛋
You... you're the dick

413
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:18,151
在卫生间写了这话
who wrote that in the bathroom!

414
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:21,387
是的  聪明又有文化的我如此孤独
Indeed. Being smart and cultured is so lonely.
