00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,169
� it seems today
that all you see �

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:07,473
� is violence in movies
and sex on tv �

3
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:11,210

good old-fashioned values �

4
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:14,213

5
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:17,616

00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:21,053

10
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,970
Man:<i> You shower</i>
<i>with your dog every day.</i>

11
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,072
<i>Do you and your dog use</i>
<i>the same soap?</i>

12
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:43,008
<i>If so, one of you</i>
<i>is damaging your hair.</i>

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,077
Really?
(concerned grunt)

14
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,846
<i>Dial cross species</i>
<i>is specially formulated</i>

15
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
<i>For both humans and dogs.</i>

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,483
<i>You'll like</i>
<i>that it gets you clean.</i>

17
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,152
<i>He'll like</i>
<i>that it smells like beef.</i>

18
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:54,987
That sounds great!
(knocking)

19
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,756
Woman: Jim, are you showering
with the dog again?

20
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,024
What the hell?!

21
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,325
All right, peter,
I'm leaving.

22
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,261
Bonnie invited me to
the shooting range.

23
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,495
What?

24
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,864
Yeah, bonnie says
she goes every week.

25
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,467
(yelling)

26
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,237
(panting)

27
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,873
I think next time
you should bring someone else.

28
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,409
Now, you'll be watching stewie,
and I don't want you just

29
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,211
To prop him up next
to the tv all day.

30
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,846
Take him to
the park.

31
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:22,181
I want him to get
some fresh air.

32
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:24,116
Fresh air is bad
for a kid, lois.

33
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,717
Look at michael j. Fox.

34
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,086
What?
I don't know.

35
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,620
Peter, you are taking
stewie to the park.

36
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,956
It'll do you good to spend
some time with your son.

37
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,925
I spend lots of time
with him, lois.

38
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,060
Just last week,
I took him to the doctor.

39
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,796
Mr. Griffin, you're here
to get your prostate examined?

40
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,099
Yeah, this is me.

41
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,105
Is that your
little one there?

42
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,941
Oh, no, it's-it's just
the way I'm sitting.

43
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,943
Ah, nothing like a day
at the park,

44
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:54,046
Surrounded by overcompensating
divorced dads.

45
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:55,914
Wow! Look how high
you're going!

46
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,749
What an amazing day this is!

47
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,084
(laughs)

48
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,453
Is mommy spending
$2,500 a month on you?

49
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,655
Because that's what
I'm sending mommy!

50
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,824
Oh, my god,
it's only been five minutes,

51
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:08,861
And I'm already bored
out of my mind.

52
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,465
Damn, I wish I could go
to the clam.

53
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,404
Aah! Well, I guess
I see those guys all the time.

54
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,144
A clown?!
Eh, well, I guess

55
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:27,513
What's the big deal, huh?
It's just one.

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,656
Oh, I was quite sure it was just
one from the size of the car!

57
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,991
(phone ringing)
hello?

58
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,325
Quagmire:
Peter, where the hell are you?

59
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,593
You got to get down
to the clam, man.

60
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,095
There's, like,
60 clowns in here.

61
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,863
Ugh, I can't.
I got to watch stewie.

62
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,267
Joe:
Peter, they threw what I thought
was a bucket of water on me,

63
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:51,136
But it turns out,
it was just a bunch of confetti!

64
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,138
Oh, man, I got
to get over there!

65
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,174
(phone beeps off)

66
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,780
Okay, okay. It's okay
as long as I can still see him.

67
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,515
Okay, stewie, there you are.

68
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,017
There you are, safe and sound.

69
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,352
Daddy can still see you.

70
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,689
Okay, daddy
can still see you.

71
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,292
Daddy can still see you.

72
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,134
Daddy can still see you.

73
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,915
That was a wink, but you don't
know it 'cause it's just a eye.

74
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,821
Man (over tv):
We now return to<i> superman.</i>

75
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,656
(all crying)

76
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,158
Lois, what's wrong?

77
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,060
Clark, we all have
breast cancer!

78
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,896
The doctor says it's as if
our breasts have been x-rayed

79
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,199
Five hours a day, every day,
for the last three years!

80
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,168
Oh, my god,
that's terrible.

81
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,238
First, every woman I've ever
known, and now you guys.

82
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,739
(sighs):
Ah!

83
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,208
Boy, it was smart
to wait out that thunderstorm.

84
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,611
(phone ringing)
aah, it's lois!

85
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,179
Oh, my god! Stewie!

86
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,947
Oh, uh, hey, lois.

87
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,349
H-hey, it's hard to hear you

88
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,517
Over the sound
of joyful children in the park.

89
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,020
Lois: Are you and stewie
having a good time?

90
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,288
Uh, uh, yeah.

91
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,789
Okay, well, let me talk to him.

92
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,058
I want to tell him
mommy's on her way home.

93
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,793
She wants to talk to stewie.
What do I do?!

94
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,129
Here, give me the phone.
I do a great stewie.

95
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,431
Hey, lois,
it's me, the baby.

96
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,134
Hi, stewie. I'm on my way home.

97
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,636
Mommy misses you.

98
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,037
All right, cool.

99
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,139
Bring some beef
jerky maybe.

100
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:37,542
I just bought
you ten minutes.

101
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,511
Stewie?

102
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,818
Oh, there's my boy.

103
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,756
Hey, what happened
to my new friend,

104
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,292
That kid who sort of
looks like me from behind?

105
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,160
Wait. Where's the fat man?

106
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,396
(siren wailing in distance)

107
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,231
Well, I guess this is it.

108
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,766
I'm gonna die here.

109
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,167
I'll never get to grow old

110
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,336
And become an across-the-country
grandparent.

111
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,971
What is this?

112
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,272
Woman:
It's a skype.

113
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,474
A snyke?
No, a skype.

114
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,575
Snype?

115
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,745
No, it's a skype...
From your grandson.

116
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,147
Stephen?

117
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,116
Yes! He's right there
trying to say hi to you.

118
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,618
What movie is this?

119
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,253
It's not a movie.

120
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,954
It's your grandson!

121
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,023
My grandson is in the pictures?

122
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,125
You did this yesterday!

123
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,427
Don't holler at me!

124
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:29,995
I don't understand anything!

125
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,797
I'm very frightened!

126
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,499
(tires screech)

127
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,335
Wait a minute.

128
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:39,371
Stewie, what happened
to your head?

129
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,772
Oh, you're not stewie.

130
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,508
I got to get you back
to the park and find...

131
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,746
(gasps)

132
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,452
All right, kid,
your name is stewie, all right?

133
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,853
I'm your new dad.

134
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,222
My name is peter,
and I work at the brewer...

135
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,359
Nasa. I work at nasa.

136
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,728
Uh, hey, lois.

137
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,797
You look fat. You
should go for a run.
Peter!

138
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,066
I'm gonna go give my
baby a kiss good night.

139
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,470
Uh, lois, I had an affair, and
I think we should talk about it!

140
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:14,940
Peter, jamming yourself into
a grapefruit is not an affair.

141
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,047
See? There's a human baby
in there.

142
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,082
Asleep in stewie's overalls.

143
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,084
Peter, please get
out of my way!

144
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,252
Aah!

145
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,353
Baby:
Aah!
Aah!

146
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,421
(doorbell rings)

147
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,723
Great. We woke up the doorbell.

148
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,426
I think there was
a mix-up at the park.

149
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,595
(gasps)
my little stewie!

150
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,029
Oh, jacob!

151
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,098
Wh-where's your little hat?

152
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,233
He didn't have a hat.

153
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,901
Oh, I am so sorry.

154
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,236
I just got
home myself.

155
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,737
I left my husband in charge,

156
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,240
Which was obviously
a terrible mistake.

157
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,243
Thank you so much.

158
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,345
I took a bath
with the dad.

159
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,747
Mmm. Oh, my baby's
back home.

160
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,115
Mommy missed you.

161
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,450
Congratulations, lois.

162
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,018
You passed the test.

163
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,286
You really do
love stewie.

164
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,921
Now, what do you
say we all sit down

165
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,424
And watch this weird al
yankovic documentary?

166
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,759
It's called
<i>an inconvenient tooth.</i>

167
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,262
(laughing)
what's wrong
with you, peter?!

168
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,530
Lois, I'm sorry.

169
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,265
How the hell
can you possibly

170
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,533
Mistake another baby
for stewie?!

171
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,967
Now, calm down, lois.

172
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,602
You're gonna say
something you don't mean.

173
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,272
Oh, no, I'm not!
You're an idiot!

174
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,474
You don't mean that.

175
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,876
I already got a facebook
friend request from the dad.

176
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,311
Is that weird?

177
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,647
Peter, I have put up
with your nonsense for 20 years,

178
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,382
But today
you crossed a line.

179
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,584
You left a helpless baby
in a public park.

180
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,654
And that's something
only an idiot would do!

181
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,390
I'm<i> not</i> an idiot.

182
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,459
(knocking)

183
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,695
Hey, I think
there was a mix-up at the park.

184
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,737
Man (over tv): We now return
to<i> the karate kid,</i>

185
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,606
With realistic human feelings.

186
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,508
You're all
right, larusso!
(crowd cheering)

187
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,244
(bleep) you just tried
to cripple me!

188
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,812
(sighs)

189
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,348
I hate to sound like every
woman ever, but I'm depressed.

190
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,916
Don't engage.
Don't engage.

191
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,184
Why?
Damn it!

192
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,919
Lois called
me an idiot.
So?

193
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,589
So, I don't tell her all the
bad things about herself.

194
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,424
Like how the mole on her back

195
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,526
Is changing shape and
size really quickly.

196
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,428
Being dumb isn't
the worst thing, peter.

197
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,163
At least you're not
two foreign guys

198
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,432
Talking too loud
in the next booth.

199
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,434
Much sorry, friend!

200
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,870
Man, there are
no womens here.

201
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:28,173
We've got to make like '70s
rock man garrett and leave.

202
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,474
You said it, belgard.

203
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,643
Looks like you and me
will have to make hands

204
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,944
On each other tonight.

205
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,312
Aah, gross!

206
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,548
(laughs) I was just
playing joke at you!

207
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,617
Ah, good one! You
should be comedy writer.

208
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,985
Too late, friend.

209
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,187
I already have
comedy development at cbs.

210
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,455
Oh, nice!

211
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,223
Cbs knows real situations

212
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,025
I want to see
for 100 episodes!

213
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,061
Thanks. My hysterical
multi-camera show is called

214
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,631
<i>Wizard robot and his</i>
<i>less successful friend.</i>

215
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,400
Oh, man, you know
what america wants.

216
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,402
All right, fine, so
I'm a dumb, hot guy.

217
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,070
All right? There's
worse things to be.

218
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,972
Okay, we're only gonna
tackle one thing today.

219
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,375
Peter, maybe you need to
broaden your horizons, you know?

220
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,709
Read a book, travel.

221
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,344
Oh, yeah, I love traveling.

222
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,579
You see new things,

223
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,247
Inconvenience thousands
of people.

224
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,916
You know what?
You guys are right.

225
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,985
It's time to travel, to learn,
to experience new things.

226
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,254
I've been letting opportunities
pass me by

227
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,989
Ever since I was a kid.

228
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,527
Hey, kid, get in my van, and
I'll give you some candy.

229
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,830
No, my mom says I shouldn't.

230
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,671
(crying)

231
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:36,741
Hey, kid, get in my van, and
I'll give you some candy.

232
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,810
Okay!

233
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,621
Stella, I need you to go
to chicago on Thursday.

234
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:53,525
I can't. This week
is the deaf games.

235
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,860
(bell clanging)

236
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,464
(bell continues clanging)

237
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,733
Oh, my god, this has been
a 12-minute round.

238
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,469
Why does every fight
have to go to the death?

239
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,804
Angela, if you got
business traveling

240
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,039
That needs to be done,
I'm your guy.

241
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,641
Griffin, I'm not
gonna look over there

242
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,910
Until you first assure
me you've got pants on.

243
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,579
It's not a rule unless
there's a sign on the wall.

244
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,581
I won that court case.
Fine.

245
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,416
So you'd be willing
to take that trip

246
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,751
To chicago for
the company?

247
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,419
Yeah, you know,
I was just saying

248
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,654
I need to broaden my horizons.

249
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,255
You see, my wife thinks
I'm an idiot.

250
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,591
She's always making me feel
small and insignificant.

251
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,627
Like john goodman's
heartbeat.

252
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,062
(heart thumps)

253
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,766
Honey? My inside left boob
stomach did that thing again.

254
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,468
You mean
your heart?

255
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,770
Um, I don't know
about any of that,

256
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,306
But I think
I should eat something.

257
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,611
Well, gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

258
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,780
Mr. Griffin, I believe you
have something for me.

259
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,749
Yes, I do, mr. Franks.
Terrific.

260
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,751
We were completely
out of these tubes.

261
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,686
Well, thank you all
for coming. Good day.

262
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,688
Nicely done,
mr. Franks.
Thanks, chief.

263
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,757
Wait, so that's it?
Hey, you nailed it!

264
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,325
But I'm here till
tomorrow night.

265
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,760
What am I
supposed to do?

266
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,428
Get out there
and explore chicago, peter.

267
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,597
It's one of the great cities
of the world.

268
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,433
There's museums,
a symphony, a lyric opera.

269
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,701
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

270
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,603
Did you say "chicken
fashion show"?

271
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,104
No.
Oh.

272
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,206
But that-that other stuff,
they all sound like

273
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:19,010
The kind of things I could
do to expand my horizons.

274
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,479
Wow.

275
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,182
Chicago:
"the san francisco treat."

276
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,484
I haven't felt this sense
of limitless adventure

277
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,486
Since I went cave jumping.

278
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,121
Here we go!

279
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:34,359
(echoing): I told no one
what I was doing today!

280
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,300
Man, I'm, like, the fifth most
attractive woman in chicago.

281
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,542
Hi. Welcome
to the museum.

282
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,343
Thanks.
Just to be clear,

283
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,678
I should touch
everything, right?

284
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,246
No, please don't
touch anything.

285
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,716
Sorry, it's my first time
at an adult museum.

286
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,350
I'm used to petting
the starfishes.

287
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,519
Well, maybe you'd find
our audio tour helpful.

288
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,088
You have your choice
of narrators:

289
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,522
Our senior curator

290
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,925
Or chicago's own
dennis farina.

291
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,094
Hmm.

292
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,496
Farina: Hey there, chief.
Dennis farina here.

293
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,164
And welcome to our museum.

294
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,735
Just so you know, I'll be
eating through most of this.

295
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,837
Yeah. This one.

296
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,573
Farina:
(chewing) ah, man,

297
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,508
That's good sausage.
(burps)

298
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,743
Oops. Excuse me.

299
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,911
Anyways, this is
<i>at the moulin rouge</i>

300
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,413
By toulouse-lautrec.

301
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,115
Uh, it's from the 1890s.

302
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:34,319
Now, he was a midge,
but he painted like a normal.

303
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,624
Now, here is a naked chick
made completely out of marble.

304
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,760
I got to wonder--
I'm sure you do, too--

305
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,729
How this thing didn't crack
when they were carving out

306
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,798
Her downstairs business.

307
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,768
(loudly): He did a great job
with the vagina.

308
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,570
Here's a picture
by this guy salvador dal�.

309
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:56,074
This guy, I'm telling you,
was a freakin' whack-a-doodle.

310
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,577
Wow, who knew you could learn
so much at a museum?

311
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,212
And this is only chicago.

312
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,748
From now on, I'm gonna volunteer
for every business trip,

313
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,584
And see all the great stuff

Man (over tv): We now return
to janeane garofalo

340
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,683
And mark ruffalo
in<i> garofaruffalo.</i>

341
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,884
Turn it off, chris.

342
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,819
I don't even want to know
what that is.

343
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,322
Your father
has returned.

344
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,690
Dad!
Oh, peter!

345
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,558
How were all your
business trips?

346
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,193
Oh, exemplary, chris.

347
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,729
I don't understand what
either of those words mean.

348
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,664
One of them
was "chris."

349
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,200
Peter, you seem...
Different.

350
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,237
That's right, lois;
I live the life of the mind now.

351
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,206
My brain is awash
with theorems and profundity

352
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,376
And abstractions that I can
pontificate upon at length.

353
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,211
Brian's a woof-cat!

354
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,146
Peter, you sound
so refined.

355
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,215
Are you...
Intelligent now?

356
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,251
Affirmative.
That means "yes."

357
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,820
Does that please you?
It does, peter.

358
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,221
Well, it should.

359
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,924
After all, knowledge is
the ultimate aphrodisiac.

360
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,893
Shall we away
for relations?

361
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,196
I'm not sure what you're
saying, but let's hump!

362
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,164
Peter (panting):
Affirmative, affirmative,

363
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,067
Affirmative...
Oh, my god, affirmative!

364
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,370
Lois:
Wow, peter, that was great!

365
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,839
Peter:
It was. Sorry I "arrived" early.

366
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,340
Lois:
That's okay.

367
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,909
Peter:
And sorry about the bedspread.

368
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,978
That was about
a week's worth of arrive.

369
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,788
Mom, dad, the tv's broken!

370
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,124
Actually, chris,
I got rid of our television.

371
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,593
This is our new bookshelf,
and I think you'll find

372
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,763
It has more channels than
any tv we've ever owned.

373
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,598
I want to watch
<i>the walking dead!</i>

374
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,201
Then I shall read to you from
mary shelley's<i> frankenstein.</i>

375
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,770
I want to watch
<i>new girl.</i>

376
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,471
Perhaps you'd like to hear
about jane eyre,

377
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:44,575
Who felt quite the new girl
at rochester's thornfield hall.

378
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,244
How about
<i>game of thrones?</i>

379
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,746
Instead, I shall read
to you from...

380
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,248
<i>Game of thrones.</i>

381
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,417
Oh, finally, another reader
in the family.

382
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,919
You know, these are some of
my favorite books and authors.

383
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,821
Oh? What are you
reading right now?

384
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,256
Oh, boy.
Well, I'm...

385
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,891
I'm sort of between
books right now.

386
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,726
Yeah? What was
the last thing you read?

387
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,328
He's got you on
the ropes now.

388
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,596
I-I'm actually<i> rereading</i>
a lot of stuff.

389
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,498
Yeah? Like what?
Just tap out.

390
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,400
Uh... The classics,
you know?

391
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,136
Going back to the,
uh... Basics, really.

392
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,339
(chuckles)
words on the printed page.

393
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,607
Thank you,
steve guttenberg, right?

394
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:17,809
What is this, oak?

395
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,577
Oh, I don't even
think it's oak!

396
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,647
Peter, I can't get over the way
you've transformed yourself.

397
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,848
How'd you do it?

398
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,917
Well, lois, some of it
came from books,

399
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,285
Some came from museums,

400
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,854
And, honestly, a lot of it
just came from travel.

401
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,190
Hey, excuse me,
I need to rent a car.

402
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,360
Preferably one where
the radio is stuck on npr.

403
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,161
Here you go.

404
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,833
(softly): Hello.
It's me. I am returning.

405
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,468
How was the car?

406
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,003
Coastal and superior.

407
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,038
I never knew whisper-talking
was so smart.

408
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,941
And how will you be paying
for your rental, sir?

409
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,710
I will pay you with stories
of my abusive father

410
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,445
Set to dissonant flute.

411
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,546
(playing gentle music)

412
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,116
I was seven when
he first came home drunk.

413
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:02,453
A child should sleep
on his bed, not under it.

414
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,191
Hey, what are you
listening to?

415
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,060
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm learning sanskrit.

416
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,728
You know,
an ancient tongue

417
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,730
Can be as titillating
as a young one.

418
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,399
Peter, what gives?
Ever since you had

419
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,334
All those business trips,
you've been acting weird.

420
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:20,038
Pity a man in familiar places
who yet feels like a stranger.

421
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,041
You... You're the dick
who wrote that in the bathroom!

422
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,210
Indeed. Being smart
and cultured is so lonely.

423
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,980
Now I know why oscar wilde
turned to alcoholism

424
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,915
And bone inhalation.

425
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,051
Gentlemen, as they
say in sanskrit,

426
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,054
<i>Shubha prabhatam.</i>

427
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,822
(laughs) you know
what's weird?

428
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,357
Shubha prabhatam
is my porn name.

429
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,558
What?

430
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,427
Yeah, first pet and
street you grew up on.

431
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,729
You had a pet
named shubha?
Oh, yeah.

432
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,264
Old shubha was
a tough pooch.

433
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,767
He was feared by everyone up
and down prabhatam drive.

434
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,470
You have
a very weird past.

435
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,508
All right, if this is
to be a smart family,

436
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,243
We will have to learn
not to giggle

437
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,879
At smart things that
sound dirty but are not.

438
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:02,947
Balzac.

439
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,582
(all giggling)

440
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,917
Homo erectus.

441
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,685
(all giggling)

442
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:08,920
Spotted dick.

443
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,254
(all giggling)

444
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,091
The results have
been disappointing.

445
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,860
I always thought
spotted dick

446
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,629
Had something
to do with morgan freeman.

447
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,101
Man (over tv):
We now return to

448
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,603
Wizard robot
and his less successful friend.

449
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,307
Aah! We're in a real jar
of jam this time, wizard robot.

450
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,308
Gip-gop.

451
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,143
I have put too much suds
in this machine

452
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,578
For washing clothes.

453
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,214
And tonight is the night
I meet with other members

454
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,149
Of my form twelve
learning mates

455
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:41,552
To celebrate the exactly
two groupings of ten years ago.

456
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,820
Gip-gop.

457
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,589
(beeping)

458
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,057
Oh, excellent!

459
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,959
The situation
has abated itself.

460
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,327
Let us leave the room

461
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,563
Where no comedic situation
will soon take place.

462
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,568
(enthusiastic audience laughter)

463
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,806
Robot voice:<i> Wizard robot and</i>
<i>his less successful friend.</i>

464
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,774
(audience cheering)

465
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,476
Hi, lois.
No, I wasn't!

466
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,478
Oh, brian, thank god
it's just you.

467
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,614
You know how peter
thinks tv rots the mind.

468
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,450
Oh, as long as you're here, can
you run some vocabulary with me?

469
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,819
I need to know how to use
these words in sentences

470
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,187
By the time
peter gets home.

471
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,122
Oh, that should be easy.
Just give me the word,

472
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,024
And I'll put it in
a sentence for you.

473
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,592
"anodyne."

474
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:25,696
Uh... A friend asked me
what "anodyne" means.

475
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,031
Oh, who am I kidding?

476
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,033
I'm never gonna learn
any of these words.

477
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,935
(groans) I can't take
this anymore, brian,

478
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,203
And the kids
can't either.

479
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,704
Peter's become
a nightmare.

480
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,973
Wait, I thought this was
what you always wanted--

481
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,775
For peter not to be
an idiot.

482
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,277
Oh, at least that peter was fun

483
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,179
And didn't make me
feel so stupid.

484
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,281
I miss the old peter.

485
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,715
Well, we got
to do something,

486
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,018
'cause this new peter
just sounds all wrong.

487
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,220
Like a pilot
without a calming voice.

488
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,122
(electronic bell dings)
pilot (screaming): We've now

489
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,723
Reached our cruising altitude!

490
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,560
If you look out the window,
you'll see the rocky mountains!

491
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,727
(all screaming)

492
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,063
We have to get
out of here!

493
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,865
(all screaming)

494
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,466
Wait a minute.

495
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,236
If visiting san francisco and
new york made peter smart,

496
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,638
Maybe if we send him
to the dumbest city

497
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,374
In the whole country, it'll
bring back the old peter.

498
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,977
Huh. It's worth a try.

499
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,482
Aloha!

500
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:19,750
(laughing)

501
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,986
(grunting, laughter)

502
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,894
Is peter home?
He's pulling in now.

503
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,696
I sure hope tucson helped.

504
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,931
Heads up, guys.
I farted on the doorstep,

505
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,366
But it's hot
on my trail.

506
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,868
Oh, brian,
that's a good sign.

507
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,870
How was your trip?
Oh, amazing.

508
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,907
I saw a wet t-shirt contest
using chocolate milk.

509
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,875
It was at
the tucson philharmonic.

510
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,077
What else did you do?

511
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,278
Eh, mostly just picked
my desert boogers.

512
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,213
Oh, peter, you're back!
Thank god!

513
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,781
We all owe that trash city
a debt of gratitude.

514
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:55,086
Did you know<i> battleship</i>
is still in theaters there?

515
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,955
