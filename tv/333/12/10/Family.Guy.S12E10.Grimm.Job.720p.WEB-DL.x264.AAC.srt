MAN (over TV):
We now return to <i>An Early Draft</i>

11
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,204
<i>of A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

12
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,975
Deb? Deb!

13
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:46,011
Debbie!

14
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,312
Good night, Lois.

15
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,148
Sorry about hitting
you at dinner.

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,316
It was nice of the manager
not to call the cops.

17
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,684
Yeah, it worked out.

18
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,219
Happy anniversary.

19
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,188
STEWIE:
Hey, hey!

20
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,523
I can't remember if I'm supposed

21
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,258
to sleep on my stomach
or my back.

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,226
What does
the current literature say?

23
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,694
Peter, go check
on Stewie.

24
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,763
Fine.

25
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,032
Oh, my God, look at you.

26
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,267
You're out of breath.

27
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,769
It's 15 feet
from your door to mine.

28
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,204
Aw, what's the matter, Stewie?

29
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,572
You a little scared in here?

30
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,374
Don't worry,
there's no monsters.

31
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,909
Of course there's
no monsters.

32
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,343
Or are you worried
about what happened

33
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,912
to that family
down the street?

34
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,281
Those three guys broke in,
beat up the father

35
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,383
with a croquet mallet,
and then stole the baby,

36
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,418
and nobody knows
where the baby is now?

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,087
Is that what you're
thinking about, buddy?

38
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,588
I am now!

39
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,391
Tell you what, Daddy'll
read you a bedtime story.

40
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,759
Ah, let's see.

41
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,761
Dr. Seuss, <i>Peter Rabbit...</i>

42
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,764
Ah, here we go,
James Michener's <i>Hawaii.</i>

43
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,966
Let's skip three feet in.

44
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,901
Aah, Pearl Harbor!

45
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,736
Okay, let's see, uh...

46
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:45,771
Ah, here we go.

47
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,773
<i>Fairy Tales.</i>

48
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,709
Oh, not on your lap.

49
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,312
Aah, gross!

50
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,247
"Jack and the Beanstalk."

51
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,749
Now, that title could be
a fairy tale or a porn.

52
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,885
Let's find out.

53
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,163
Jack, we need to put
food on the table.

54
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,498
Oh, give me a break, Wife.

55
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,333
You know, if you could
spin straw into gold

56
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,568
or-or maybe meth,
I wouldn't need a job.

57
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,836
Well, then, sell the cow!

58
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,972
And be sure you get
real money for it.

59
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,340
What else would I get?

60
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,342
I don't know-- magic beans?

61
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,843
There are magic beans?

62
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:25,844
I don't know.

63
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,246
Who cares?

64
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,014
Well, what's
magic about them?

65
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,183
Don't get magic
beans, you idiot.

66
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,751
What? I-I'd never
even freaking heard

67
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,353
of magic beans
till you said them.

68
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:37,089
If I do get them,
it's you what caused it.

69
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,362
So, you're selling me?

70
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,297
Yeah, well, you heard
her back there.

71
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,800
She wants her stupid magic beans
so the whole world has to stop.

72
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,169
Halt, travelers!

73
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,436
Oh, my God!

74
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,871
Why do you look like that?

75
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,340
Ah, all of these stories
were written by Germans.

76
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,477
But nobody can cross my bridge
without paying a toll.

77
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,945
A toll? Like what?

78
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,847
You have to name three
great Jewish athletes

79
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,449
or pay a thousand
gold coins.

80
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,652
Uh, Hank Greenberg,

81
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,187
Sandy Koufax

82
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,222
and, uh, Gal Fridman,

83
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,790
Olympic windsurfer.

84
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,058
Took gold in Athens in 2000

85
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,893
and the bronze
in Atlanta in '96.

86
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,895
I can see you're
on your phone.

87
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,664
Oh, come on,
I'm supposed to go into town

88
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,998
and sell this cow.

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,700
Ooh, you're selling that cow?

90
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:25,037
I don't have much, but I'll give
you some magic beans for it.

91
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,242
(gasps) That's exactly
what I was supposed to get!

92
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,412
I said <i>not</i> magic beans.

93
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,347
Look, le-let's
just admit we both

94
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,848
kind of got our
wires crossed,

95
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,184
and commit to being
clearer in the future.

96
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,587
Jack, I'm sick of your
irresponsible behavior.

97
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,089
Like when you were supposed
to be babysitting Georgie Porgie

98
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,592
and his sleazy brother
Rick Porgie.

99
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,261
Hey, Rick, you want to kiss
some girls and make them cry?

100
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:52,664
No, but let's thumb-blast them
and make them puke.

101
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,900
What the hell are we supposed
to do with these anyway?

102
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,169
I knew you'd be mad, so
I've asked the band Heart

103
00:03:57,171 --> 00:04:00,239
to explain these beans in a
way you can dreamily digest.

♪ These beans that sleep

109
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:21,860
They changed the word
"dreams" to "beans."

110
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,563
I-I was hoping they'd
change a few more words

111
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,298
to pertain to our situation,

112
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,533
but I-I-I'm just
happy they did this.

113
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,801
Jack, this is ridiculous.

114
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,737
Tomorrow I want you
to go back out there

115
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,439
and look for a job
that pays actual money.

116
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,475
These things are worthless.

117
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,545

Oh, my God!

Wha-What is that?

126
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,521
I think those magic beans
grew into a giant beanstalk.

127
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,256
Hey, where the hell'd
that thing come from?

128
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,758
It's blocking my view of
Little Miss Muffet's tuffet.

129
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,927
MISS MUFFET:
Ooh, isn't my tuffet soft

130
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,829
and pink and wonderful?

131
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,631
Ah, damn it!
I need to see that

132
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,299
so I can make curds and whey.

133
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,767
Relax, Rumpleforeskin.

134
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,437
This is a magic beanstalk
that grew overnight.

135
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,638
And I'm gonna climb it.

136
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,106
Jack, what are you
talking about?

137
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,774
You can't climb all
the way up there.

138
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,276
I have to.

139
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,178
My old gym coach is over there
with a whistle.

140
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,179
(whistle blows)

141
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,947
Come on, Jack,
your brother was

142
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,515
varsity beanstalk climbing.

143
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,884
(crying):
He's dead!

144
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,865
And now to throw
this handful of change down

145
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,801
because I'm a psychopath.

146
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,036

Aah, damn it!

147

devil are you? Go away!

150
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,477
Aw, I-I'm sorry.

151
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,011
Are you taking
a goose poop?

152
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,747
I'm not defecating,
you nitwit.

153
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:22,814
I'm laying an egg.

154
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,083
(grunting)

155
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,588
(gasps)
Golden eggs!

156
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,156
Oh, my God!

157
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,724
This is probably
what famous black rappers

158
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,560
eat for breakfast.

00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,939
I smell the blood
of an English man.

163
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,609
It's odd that you would speak
gibberish of your own choosing

164
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,377
and not make it rhyme.

165
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,945
How did you get here?

166
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,046
By beanstalk.

167
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,348
How did you get up here?

168
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,283
This is just a house
floating in the air.

169
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,885
I fell from a higher cloud.

170
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,887
That is not what happened.
H-He's out of his mind.

171
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,623
He just sits in his room all
day and inhales hair spray.

172
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,925
Well, you can't have my goose.

173
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,127
Okay, two men
fighting over me.

174
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,729
Neat.

175
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,397
All right, we're just gonna
have to quietly run away.

176
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,899
I'll create a diversion.

177
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,233
Aah! Look at me!

178
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,568
Look at me! Look at me!

179
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,869
Aah!

180
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,826
Damn beanstalk.

181
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,461
Hey, Little Boy Brown!

182
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,129
You said you were
gonna help me saw.

183
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,997
CLEVELAND: I can't
find no gloves!

184
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,536
(grunts) Aah!

185
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,251
Aah!

186
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,959
Jack six, giant zero.

187
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,495
What? What? Why-why
is that six points?

188
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,029
Oh, Jack, you're safe.

189
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,664
I was so worried.

190
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,199
And I got this golden goose.

191
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,201
Our troubles are over.

192
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,103
Well, our-our money
troubles are over.

193
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,740
Our sexual troubles are still...
are still very much alive.

194
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,816
Now we wait.

195
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,284
"The end."

196
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,219
So, the lesson there is
if you steal,

197
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,188
you better be ready
to murder, too.

198
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,390
What do you say
we read another one?

199
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,226
Wow, you got a great view
into Bonnie's window from here.

200
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,362
Man, how do you get
any work done?

201
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,297
What do you mean?
Lois is prettier than Bonnie.

202
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,632
Oh, I get it.

203
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,833
It's worse, but it's different.

204
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:55,967
Okay, all right,
so that's something.

205
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,202
Okay.

206
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,343
So I got out of the
car to take a leak,

207
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,078
because I'd been drinking,
and I didn't know

208
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,547
it was next to a
children's park.

209
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,881
But anyway, that's
why this lady

210
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,017
has to watch whenever
I play with you.

211
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,485
Both hands
on the book, please.

212
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,520
It's my son!
Come on!

213
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,521
Geez!

214
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,189
Thank you, Maya.

215
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,560
All right, the next story is
"Little Red Riding Hood."

216
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,795
(birds chirping)

217
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,033
<i>Red Riding Hood</i>
<i>was choosing her clothes</i>

218
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,502
<i>for a journey</i>
<i>across the forest.</i>

219
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:31,736
You know, if I had the guts,

220
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,371
I would be
Little White Turtleneck.

221
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,373
And by "guts," I mean "body."

222
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,177
Red, don't forget this basket
of food for Grandma.

223
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,079
This whole thing is
way too heavy.

224
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,214
Wh-Why are you putting
a bag of ice in here?

225
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,451
Is this... is this
a Coors Party Ball?

226
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,752
Is Grandma going
to be entertaining

227
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,788
Florida Jet Ski people?

228
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,390
Remember, stay on the path
and you'll be fine.

229
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,593
Oh, yes, great advice
from mother of the year.

230
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:58,363
You do realize Grandma
lives 68 miles away, right?

231
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,032
You-you're sending your
child out there to die.

232
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,770
♪ Tra-la-la-la-la

233
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,039
♪ Skipping song,
skipping song ♪

234
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,642
♪ No one's here
to call me gay. ♪

235
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,944
If you were my son,
I would kill you.

236
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,747
Really? Because I hear
your son is a sap.

237
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:16,982
(laughs)

238
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,416
If you're gonna
hit the king,

239
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,652
you better kill the king.

240
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,095
(roars)

241
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,162
Oh, hey.

242
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,564
You're the wolf, right?

243
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,132
BRIAN:
Yup, and don't forget
"big" and "bad."

244
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,800
(growls)

245
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,168
(chuckles) Nah.

246
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,174
So, um, what happened with you
and those three little pigs?

247
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,143
Wh-Why did you want
to eat them so badly?

248
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,446
It-it's so amazing that that's
what people think happened.

249
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,615
First of all, I didn't want
to eat them, all right?

250
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,017
I wanted to talk
to one of them.

251
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,151
About what?

252
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,352
Well, she was
my ex-girlfriend,

253
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,821
and I believed
I was due an explanation

254
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,090
about why she was
such a (bleep) whore.

255
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,859
All right, well, I'm
off to my grandmother's,

256
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,528
but before I go, I better
take a deep-woods dump.

257
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,031
Her bathroom is right
off the dining room.

258
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:10,168
So, it's either now
or three days from now.

259
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,706
Where are you going, dear?

260
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,008
I got to go check
on my shoe apartment complex.

261
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,778
Old woman breeds
like a gopher.

262
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,048
(lively music playing)

263
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,884
Hello?
Is anyone home?

264
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:28,620
CONSUELA:
Ay, no, no.

265
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,856
I can hear
the muffled Mexican music.

266
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,626
Look, if you guys
don't shape up,

267
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:35,827
I'm gonna rent this place

268
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,129
to Goldilocks
and the three bears.

269
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,031
Ooh, this is nice.

270
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,734
It's every bit as
darling as you said.

271
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,903
They're gonna
fix up the place.

272
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,674
(knocking)

273
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,309
Who is it?

274
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,211
(imitating Stewie):
It's your granddaughter, Red.

275
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,813
How do I know it's you?

276
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,514
Oh, come on, that's
a perfect imitation.

277
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,884
Open up. I brought strawberry
shortcake and Cool Whip.

278
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,919
And what?

279
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,487
Oh, sorry.
I mean Cool Hwhip.

280
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,223
That's my little girl.

281
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,426
Oh, my!
(growling)

282
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,527
(roars)

283
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,796
(wolf howling)

284
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,399
(knocking)

285
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,568
(high-pitched voice):
Come in.

286
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,169
Who the hell are you?

287
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,871
Why, your grandma,
of course.

288
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:20,939
All right, fine.

289
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,207
I guess we're doing this.

290
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,743
My, what big eyes
you have, Grandma.

291
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,178
All the better
to see you with, my dear.

292
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,880
My, what big...
You know what?

293
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,215
I-I'm sorry, I-I can't.

294
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,550
I-I can't do this.
I-I'm not an idiot.

295
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,085
My grandma is a human woman.

296
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,854
How-how was this ever a scene?

297
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,055
All right, fine, yes.

298
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,256
It's me, the wolf.

299
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,691
Must we go through
this charade?

300
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:40,925
It's insulting.

301
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,260
I don't know
why you're complaining.

302
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,561
I'm the one who's about

303
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,296
to get violently bisected
by the woodsman.

304
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,132
What woodsman?
(chain saw buzzing nearby)

305
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,101
Ha-ha!

306
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,781
You know, I'm not sure
if that's our hero

307
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,115
or just a lunatic

308
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,617
going house to house
murdering people.

309
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,152
PETER:
Ha-ha!

310
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,153
(chain saw buzzing)

311
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,288
(man screaming)

312
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,489
(thud)

313
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,891
Yeah, he-he-he
just did it again.

314
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,159
I think we should...

315
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,327
I think we should call somebody.

316
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,904
Aw, look at the little guy.

317
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,839
So peaceful.

318
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,340
Hey! Wake up! We got one more!

319
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,975
(Stewie yells)

320
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,478
Now, if this don't get you
to sleep, nothing will.

321
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,815
"Cinderella"
by nobody remembers.

322
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,753
<i>A long time ago,</i>
<i>in a magical, faraway land,</i>

323
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:45,290
<i>several women lived together</i>
<i>and, surprise, surprise,</i>

324
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,592
<i>they didn't exactly get along.</i>

325
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,330
Hey, Cinderella,
how's the scrubbing going?

326
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,099
God, we have so few female
characters to work with.

327
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,968
You just keep scrubbing
that poo spot

328
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,204
so I can come back
and poo on that spot again.

329
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:02,207
You guys are gonna regret
being mean to me someday.

330
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,842
Mean to you? Us?

331
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,377
When are we ever
mean to you?

332
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,313
Remember the time
you told King Midas

333
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,014
to go to third base with me?

334
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,850
Now I'm dealing with this.

335
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,318
(metal dinging)

336
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,553
I dated him, too.

337
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,963
It's so unfair that we're called
the "evil" stepsisters.

338
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,031
Yeah, I mean,
you'd be evil, too,

339
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,033
if your stepdad was
Bruce Jenner.

340
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,537
Hey, girls, feel my cheek,
it's like a bottom!

341
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,572
(plays fanfare)

342
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,374
He stole me horn!

343
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,576
(plays off-key)

344
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,512
Well, I don't,
I don't know what that was,

345
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,082
but th-the first one has
a parchment from the Charmings.

346
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,384
(gasps)

347
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,253
It's an invite to a party
for the prince!

348
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,754
I hear he's looking
for someone

349
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,155
to spend the rest
of his life with.

350
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,857
Well, it won't be you.

351
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,560
Yeah, there's a reason this
story's not called "Cinderella."

352
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,995
Actually, it is.

353
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:00,098
Ah, that does not
bode well for us.

354
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,271
Now, since we're all
planning on drinking,

355
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,373
I called us a pumpkin.

356
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,774
LOIS:
Wait for me!

357
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,380
You said, if I had
a nice dress,

358
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,781
I could go to the ball.

359
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,050
How did you even make
that dress so fast?

360
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,519
Oh, you know,
I-I have an eye for fashion,

361
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,755
and I'm pretty good
with my hands.

362
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,290
Unbelievable.

363
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,358
Now I'm worried about that
screenplay we gave her.

364
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,960
You're not going
to the ball!

365
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,863
It's for ladies,
not scumbag nobodies.

366
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:35,633
Girls, shred her dress and
divvy it up for monthlies.

367
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,975
(laughs)

368
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,644
(crying)

369
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,247
(all laughing)

370
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,149
Well, that's
not cool, either.

371
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,984
They're all kind of bitches.

372
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,124
And then they ripped up my dress
so now I have nothing to wear.

373
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,294
Well, sometimes
"nothing to wear" is a fun time.

374
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,496
You know, just get weird.

375
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,568
Cinderella, I am
your fairy godmother.

376
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,272
"Fairy" in the magical sense,
not about kissing guys.

377
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,074
Oh, my God!

378
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:19,077
I want that bitch Snow White to
just admit she had an abortion.

379
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,478
Whoa, whoa!

380
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,780
I was thinking more like
a new dress for the party.

381
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,415
Or a bunch of chew toys.

382
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,583
Your choice.

383
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,951
Chew toys.
Take the chew toys.

384
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,319
A new dress?

385
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,688
Well, that means I
could go to the ball!

386
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,595
Oh, what a beautiful dress.

387
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,297
B-But how will I
get to the ball?

388
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,866
I-I don't have a horse
or a carriage.

389
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,672
(grunting)

390
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,341
Oh, yeah, that's... yeah,
just change me into whatever.

391
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,876
Yeah, that's cool. Thanks.

392
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,678
Well, is everything
all right in here...?

393
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,348
(yells)
This hurts! This hurts!

394
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,493
This ball is kind of lame.

395
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:11,295
All these royal types
are inbreeding, walleyed,

396
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,564
bucktooth monsters
who have to be wheeled around

397
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,699
under a blanket.

398
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,568
I say! Wherever is Grandmum-mum?

399
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,872
She would so enjoy
the festoonities!

400
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,240
That's not a word, sir.

401
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,376
My mind races from the damp!

402
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,644
Hey, how are you?

403
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,679
Hey, hi, there.
Thanks for coming.

404
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,916
These are my daughters,
and they will do anything

405
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,986
to be your princess,
right, girls?

406
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,487
See anything
you like?

407
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,057
Oh, I'm so fancy
and moist.

408
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,525
Ew, you guys are gross.

409
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,094
But stick around in case
I don't find anyone else.

410
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,003
Okay, first of all,
obviously the dress.

411
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,337
Wow.

412
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,373
And you smell slightly
less worse

413
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,175
than everyone else
in the kingdom.

414
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,777
Oh, why, thank you,
I just bathed last year.

415
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,080
♪

416
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,200
(bell ringing)

417
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,069
(gasps)

418
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,404
Hey, wh-where you going?

419
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,371
Come back here!

420
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,739
You brushed up against it!

421
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,708
You got to take care of it now!

422
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,687
Wait, wait, you forgot
your glass slipper.

423
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,058
And a box of condoms.

424
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,161
Aw, man!
Things were gonna happen.

425
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,069
We almost kissed.

426
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,471
Why couldn't the magic have
lasted five more minutes?

427
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,508
Now I'll never get to be
a rich, do-nothing wife.

428
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,178
Sorry your dreams
haven't come true.

429
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,587
My lord, there is no sign
of her, and we searched far.

430
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,523
Did you search wide?
No.

431
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,992
You got to search wide,
that's like half of it.

432
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,094
(neighs)

433
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,329
PETER:
<i>And so the prince searched</i>
<i>all over the kingdom</i>

434
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,031
<i>for the foot</i>
<i>that fit the glass slipper.</i>

435
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,533
<i>Well, not "all" over.</i>

436
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,469
<i>He skipped the, uh,</i>
<i>south side of town,</i>

437
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,271
<i>which, uh, even</i>
<i>in fairy tale times,</i>

438
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,173
<i>was, um...</i>

439
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,441
<i>let's just say "loud."</i>

440
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,315
And so, whoever fits in this
slipper will be my princess.

441
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,184
Or prince.

442
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,885
I'm bi.

443
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,854
Oh, there's my slipper!

444
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,355
Oh, I've been looking
all over for it.

445
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,158
Well, when I'm not
doing gymnastics.

446
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,060
This could be your life.

447
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,062
LOIS: Enough!
(gasps)

448
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,299
It's you.

449
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,900
ALL THREE:
Her?

450
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,147
I can't wait to make love
to you a hundred years

451
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,550
before the invention
of toilet paper.

452
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,520
<i>And so, two people who danced</i>
<i>together one time</i>

453
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:25,489
<i>entered into an ill-advised,</i>
<i>long-term relationship.</i>

454
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,426
<i>And they lived happily ever</i>
<i>after for seven months</i>

455
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,162
<i>and then separated with</i>
<i>the goal of fixing themselves</i>

456
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:32,763
<i>and getting back together.</i>

457
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,665
<i>They got into a huge fight</i>
<i>when his mom got sick.</i>

458
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,867
<i>And now they don't even follow</i>
<i>each other on Twitter.</i>

459
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,769
<i>The end.</i>

460
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,613
Good night, Stewie.

461
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,449
Good night, Chris.

462
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,052
Good night, Meg.
