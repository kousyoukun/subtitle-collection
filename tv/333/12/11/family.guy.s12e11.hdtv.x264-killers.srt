12
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:38,395
Ah, this hunting trip
is long overdue.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,798
Yeah, I mean, it's just too bad
that all the-the animals

14
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,533
are so spread out, you know?

15
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:44,527
I mean, wouldn't it
be awesome if-if they were all

16
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:46,036
grouped together,
like in a cafeteria,

17
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:48,172
and you could just go in there
with a trench coat

18
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:49,406
and just waste them?

19
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:52,042
Well, maybe I can stir up
some quail or pheasant

20
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:54,311
with my patented
bird calls.

21
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,046
Birds! Quail! Pheasant!

22
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:57,614
Come on out!

23
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:01,552
I'm a bird of the opposite sex
who's interested in mating!

24
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,287
Did you hear that?

25
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:04,655
We're gonna get laid!

26
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,490
Billy, Billy, come on.

27
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,225
Don't be stupid.

28
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:22,139
Should've taken
the shot, fat-ass.

29
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:23,774
Ah, ah, ow!

30
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:30,414
Hey, Peter, you got
your safety on, right?

31
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:31,682
Yeah, of course.

32
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,350
Okay, 'cause your gun is
pointing right at me.

33
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,551
Well, you want me
to pull the trigger

34
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:35,919
and prove it to you?

35
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:37,755
No, I just want to make
sure your safety's on.

36
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:38,989
There. See, Quagmire?

37
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:39,990
Safety's on.

38
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:41,992
Now this is a gun
without a safety.

39
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:44,368
Quite the difference, huh?

40
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,896
Damn it, Peter,
you son of a bitch!

41
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,897
You shot me!

42
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:48,132
Oh, my God, Peter!

43
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,134
That might be the dumbest
thing you've ever done.

44
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:51,735
No, the dumbest
thing I ever did

45
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,604
was open that
can of whup-ass.

46
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,110
Lois, why did you buy this?!

47
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:02,579
It was on sale!

48
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:10,220
A writer who inherits
a magic typewriter

49
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,556
that writes for him,

50
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,527
but then it turns out
the typewriter is... racist?

51
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,328
Totally makes sense.

52
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:20,330
Older technology,
older world view.

53
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:22,299
And that is a good day.

54
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,967
I earned some banana bread.

55
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,737
Oh, crap.

56
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,838
It's Dylan.

57
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:29,606
Dylan? Your son?

58
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,675
I haven't heard you
mention him in ages.

59
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,078
Yeah, I-I decided to step away
from the whole situation.

60
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,214
The last thing he needs
is a father who's,

61
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:39,383
you know, sometimes
there, sometimes not.

62
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,819
Really? When-when was the part
when you were there?

63
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:43,287
Hey, if I
click "ignore,"

64
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,055
will he know that I'm
sending him to voice mail?

65
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:46,089
Hey, Dylan!

66
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,558
Hey, it's Stewie!

67
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:49,593
Yeah, I'm right here
with your dad!

68
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,729
Hey... hey, Dylan.

69
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:53,864
Hey, Dad!

70
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,298
I know we haven't
talked in a while,

71
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,601
but I'm calling because
I'm on my way to Quahog.

72
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,902
Oh, really?

73
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:00,571
W-When are you
getting here?

74
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,772
Tuesday...
Oh, don't say Tuesday!

75
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,074
Aw, aw, I'm at the...
I'm at the...

76
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,909
I'm out at
the project all day.

77
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:07,911
Aw, hands on,
indispensable.

78
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:10,347
They-they need me there,
so, wow.

79
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:12,082
Rats. Bummer.

80
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,451
I can cover for you
at the project, Brian!

81
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,519
Go see your boy!

82
00:03:15,553 --> 00:03:16,753
Dad, who's your coworker?

83
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:17,788
He sounds nice.

84
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,223
He's widely disliked
here, but, uh...

85
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:20,958
I'll meet you Tuesday
at the coffee shop.

86
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,793
Sounds great.
I'll see you then.

87
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,795
Okay, b-bye.

88
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,530
See? Don't you feel better?

89
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:27,865
You're gonna go
to that lunch,

90
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:29,266
you're gonna reconnect
with your son.

91
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,267
It'll be great.

92
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:31,668
I don't know, Stewie.

93
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:33,270
Trust me, you should
take my advice.

94
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:35,138
I mean, I'm the guy
who told Michael Chiklis

95
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,740
to wear tight shirts.

96
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:38,242
I'll tell you
anything you want,

97
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:39,910
just get your boob
out of my face!

98
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:42,513
You know the difference
between you and me, dirtbag?

99
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:46,517
No matter how muscular I get,
I will never be muscular.

100
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:52,556
Hey, Quagmire,
what's with the cast?

101
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,192
Did you hurt your arm after
I shot you in the arm?

102
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:56,994
The shooting was
the injury, Peter!

103
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,530
Look, I already said I was
sorry, like, a hundred times.

104
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:02,065
Oh, and before I forget,
I want my Huey Lewis CD back.

105
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,333
Well, I want a new drug.

106
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,701
Okay, at least
you've been using it.

107
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,869
But I want
it back, Peter.

108
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:06,870
This is it.
Ooh-ah.

109
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,226
Damn it, Peter,
just give it back.

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,507
I can't give it back.
I lost it in a poker game.

111
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,342
What?
I didn't think he could beat a two.

112
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,677
Where the hell
do you get off

113
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,312
betting my CD
in a poker game?

114
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:16,880
I don't think
I like your tone.

115
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:19,883
W-What? You're-you're saying
I'm being the unreasonable one?!

116
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,385
Jeez, calm down,
you guys.

117
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:22,586
No, no, Joe, Joe, Joe,

118
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,054
it's time somebody
said this to him.

119
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:26,590
Peter Griffin,
you are an idiot!

120
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:29,326
You can't even walk
and chew gum at the same time.

121
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,295
Peter, come on!

122
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:32,362
Walk over here.

123
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:34,865
I'm doing something.

124
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,134
One thing at a time.

125
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:38,302
Damn it, Peter, that's it!

126
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:40,103
I am done!
I'm done with you!

127
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:41,338
I'm done with
all your crap!

128
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:42,873
I never want to
speak to you again!

129
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,474
This friendship is over!

130
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:45,475
Well, fine!

131
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,677
I don't need your friendship!

132
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:47,945
I got other friends.

133
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:49,846
I got my silent movie friends.

134
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:18,175
Coming up, we'll meet
a Filipino man

135
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:20,310
who actually has
a grown-up haircut.

136
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:22,079
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

137
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,014
Aren't you supposed to be
having lunch with Dylan?

138
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:26,088
Yeah, you know, Stewie,
I've been thinking about it.

139
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,085
And I haven't seen
him in years,

140
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,220
and at this point,
I-I just don't see

141
00:05:30,254 --> 00:05:31,722
what could possibly
be gained

142
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:32,990
from me getting
together with him.

143
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,726
In entertainment news,
Hollywood comes to Quahog

144
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,694
in the form of a new
Disney Channel show

145
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,529
called <i>Parent Boppers,</i>

146
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:41,198
about a group of
teen detectives.

147
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:43,734
The show, set and filmed
right here in Rhode Island,

148
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:47,571
stars local teen and
Irish trash Dylan Flannigan.

149
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:49,039
Brian, did you hear that?

150
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:51,341
Your son's gonna be a TV star!

151
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:52,976
Brian?

152
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,581
He's off to lunch, Meg.

153
00:05:57,615 --> 00:05:59,850
Oh, that dog o' mine!

154
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:01,284
That's Mike Drunkbeater.

155
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,552
Look it up on the Internet.

156
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:16,092
Wow, my son Dylan
on a TV show.

157
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,160
Funny how life
turns out, isn't it?

158
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,396
You remember that weekend
we watched TV together?

159
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,066
Boy, little did I know
how much that was gonna rub off.

160
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:25,534
Did we watch
TV together?

161
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,703
Oh, probably.
But, wow, huh?

162
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,105
And-and you know what's weird?

163
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,674
You're on a show...
I'm a writer.

164
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,943
It's-it's almost like
the universe is trying to...

165
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,444
...I don't know,

166
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,446
make us work together
or something, I don't know.

167
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,182
You... you want
a job on my show?

168
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:41,951
Hey, hey, don't put
the universe's words

169
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,185
in my mouth, okay?

170
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,687
I don't know, Dad.

171
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,622
I've-I've barely seen you
in the past few years.

172
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,491
So, what better way
to reconnect

173
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,159
than by working
together every day?

174
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:51,727
Well, I suppose
I could talk to them,

175
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:52,895
see if they'd
go for it.

176
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:53,896
Why wouldn't they?

177
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,131
I-I mean,
it wouldn't be

178
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,966
the craziest idea
in show business.

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,967
When I grow up,

180
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,835
I want to stick my head
through a circle

181
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,804
at the beginning
of movies and roar.

182
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,876
What's up now, bitches?!

183
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:12,815
We now return to
<i>Saving Private Ryan,</i>

184
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,550
brought to you without
commercial interruption

185
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,018
by Mazda.

186
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:26,996
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

187
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:30,866
Zoom zoom.

188
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:38,574
Hey, Jerome, can you
clear out my booth?

189
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,876
Looks like somebody
left their trash here.

190
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,145
Jerome, can you tell
that

191
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,480
to  get
the hell out of here

192
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:46,115
before I
kick him in the face?

193
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,651
Peter, why don't you just sit
in that booth over there?

194
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:51,253
Oh, man, that's where the
after-work secretaries sit.

195
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:55,090
What about Mr. Demerson?
Is he single?

196
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,659
I... I-I don't know.

197
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,427
What about Mr. Adelaide?
Is he single?

198
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,962
I don't know
who that is.

199
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:01,764
Well, who do you know
who is single?

200
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,766
Uh, I'm assuming you.

201
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,434
Oh-oh, hey, look! Cake!

202
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:10,372
Hey, Joe!
Hey, Joe, I'm over here!

203
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,607
Joe! Joe!
Come sit with me!

204
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,108
Come on, you guys.

205
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:14,843
Joe, I got a box of
salt water taffies,

206
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:16,011
and you can have two.

207
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:17,179
Joe, I got
a deck of cards

208
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:18,514
you can put in your
wheels to look cool.

209
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,616
Joe, I'll do the wavy
stomach for you.

210
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,785
Looks like a real wave.

211
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,553
Joe, I can scream
your name real loud!

212
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,122
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!

213
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,257
I can yell it louder!

214
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,793
Joe! Joe! Joe!

215
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:34,263
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!

216
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:36,198
What the hell
is going on here?!

217
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm in there trying
to take a leak!

218
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:39,568
What, you think
I'm here to amuse you?

219
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,770
You made me dribble
on my Bruno Maglis

220
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,806
turning to see
who's calling my name!

221
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,741
Joe Pesci thought we were
talking to him

222
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,409
'cause his name is Joe.

223
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,279
Oh, you don't know who
Joe Pesci is, 'cause you're 14.

224
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:53,983
You see, in the '90s,
this was a tough guy.

225
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,724
Hey, multiracial
group of friends,

226
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,125
you want to hang out?

227
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,793
Cut! That's a five.

228
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:07,129
Tell my assistant I fell asleep
with a condom on again,

229
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:09,031
and to bring scissors
to my trailer.

230
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,402
All right, guys,
before we begin today,

231
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:16,438
I want to introduce our newest
staff writer, Brian Griffin.

232
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,473
Hi, guys.

233
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:19,308
Yes, I am that Brian Griffin.

234
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:22,444
You probably have my novel,
but just so you know, in here,

235
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,580
I'm just one of
the guys, all right?

236
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,548
You have my novel, right?

237
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,750
Nope? No?

238
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,385
You got it, though.
Nope?

239
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:30,486
You got it?

240
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,354
Nope, nobody's got it.

241
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:33,689
All right.

242
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:35,457
Okay, so we got to
come up with a story

243
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,458
for next week's episode.

244
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,693
How about we do one

245
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,194
where DJ gets his
driver's license?

246
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:40,796
That could work.
I don't think we've done that.

247
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,797
Love that idea.

248
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,998
No, no, no.

249
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,034
Guys, guys, come on,
where's the STWISTUSION?

250
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,970
Really?
Really?

251
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,605
I'm the only guy here
who's heard of that?

252
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,641
Stakes, twists, conclusion--
STWISTUSION.

253
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,209
That sounds made up.

254
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,378
Let me ask you something:
are you afraid right now?

255
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:57,713
What? No.

256
00:09:57,747 --> 00:09:58,914
That's what's wrong.

257
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,516
You should be, you know?

258
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,784
Art is scary.

259
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:02,885
This is writing, man.

260
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,253
The viewer wants to be raped.

261
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:07,089
Are you saying my nine-year-old
daughter wants to be raped?

262
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,024
Now you're asking
the right questions.

263
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:11,960
Now you're being creative,
thinking outside the box.

264
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:14,763
Take what you think you know
and go a different way with it.

265
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:17,399
Like-like, for instance,
what if the daughter in <i>Taken</i>

266
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,435
was Zooey Deschanel?

267
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,704
Send me her head.

268
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,576
Peter, Quagmire, I've
called you here today

269
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,278
because this
has got to stop.

270
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:31,580
The petty vying
for my attention,

271
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:34,550
the late-night phone
calls, the attack ads.

272
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:36,552
<i>Glenn Quagmire claims to be</i>

273
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,020
<i>Joe Swanson's good friend.</i>

274
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,390
<i>But would a "good friend"</i>
<i>not return a leaf blower</i>

275
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:44,293
<i>for four months</i>
<i>during the leafy season?</i>

276
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:45,461
I'm Peter Griffin,

277
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:47,763
and I broke into a news station
to make this.

278
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:49,098
Hey, who's that guy?

279
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:55,003
Well, look, you guys have
given me no alternative.

280
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:56,638
I have to choose
one of you.

281
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:57,740
So I choose Quagmire.

282
00:10:57,774 --> 00:10:59,274
What?!
Suck it!

283
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:00,509
I'm sorry, Peter,

284
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:01,977
it's just that
Quagmire's been there

285
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,645
for me in some
pretty dark days.

286
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,148
And he's been a wonderful
godfather to Susie.

287
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:08,984
There she is,
my little Susie-woozie!

288
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,088
I love Susie more!
Come here, Susie!

289
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:15,591
Uncle Peter's gonna
give you a raspberry.

290
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:20,763
Peter, that's not
where you do a raspberry.

291
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:23,165
I closed my eyes too early.

292
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:25,134
I think it's best
if you leave.

293
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:26,468
Oh, yeah?

294
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:28,737
Well, maybe I'll hang out
with my godson, Kevin.

295
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,305
Get out!

296
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,441
He was masturbating
with a knife.

297
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,347
We're rolling!

298
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:41,483
My stupid parents want me
to wear a bike helmet.

299
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:43,085
Parents are lame.

300
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,120
Hold on, other kids.
Maybe they just recognize

301
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:47,389
that nothing can protect us
from the tedium

302
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:48,891
of our mundane lives.

303
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:51,393
Aren't we all on bikes
without helmets?

304
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:54,129
Sometimes I just want
to put this gun in my mouth.

305
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:57,266
Cut! Your line is
"That's right, Cameron."

306
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,268
I know. My dad wrote
that one for me.

307
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,469
Again with this?

308
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,137
Yesterday, you had
Dakota give herself

309
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:05,040
an abdomen-punch abortion during
her volleyball tournament.

310
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:07,009
Hey, seventh grade
can be hell.

311
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,177
Brian, you're fired.

312
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:09,178
Wait, what?!

313
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:10,612
Sorry, Brian,
but you're done.

314
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,582
Oh, come on! You can't fire a
writer in the middle of a show!

315
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,017
That would be like
a doctor leaving

316
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,351
in the middle
of a surgery!

317
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:18,987
Help!

318
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:21,557
I'm supposed to have surgery,
but my doctor disappeared.

319
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:24,827
Okay, Josh, this is the shot
you've been waiting for.

320
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,398
Okay, Derek,
this is the shot

321
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,133
you've been waiting for.

322
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:34,403
Dylan, Dylan,
there you are!

323
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,004
Listen, you can't
let them fire me!

324
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,339
You're the star
of the show!

325
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:39,908
Dad, believe me, I want
you to work here with me,

326
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:41,677
but you can't keep
doing things like that.

327
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:43,145
And they know
you took those cases

328
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,580
of Diet Coke
home last night.

329
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,215
I thought they were
anybody's Diet Coke!

330
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:47,716
They're for work!
I work at home!

331
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,985
Oh, hey, by the way, are we all
getting those backpacks

332
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,587
with the name
of the show on them?

333
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:52,921
You know what, Dad?

334
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:54,636
I'm starting to think
that you've just been

335
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,725
using me to advance
your career!

336
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,027
God! You're
a terrible father!

337
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,096
I never want to
see you again!

338
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,100
My God, he's right.

339
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:08,237
I <i>am</i> a terrible father.

340
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:53,334
Brian, do you
know where...

341
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:55,336
What the hell
are you drinking?

342
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,271
Is that Rite Aid-
brand whiskey?

343
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,909
Stewie, I just feel so awful
about what happened with Dylan.

344
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:04,578
I mean, every terrible thing
he said about me is true.

345
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,313
Well, you're
a terrible guy, Bri.

346
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:09,450
I think being a paid writer
again just went to my head.

347
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:12,486
I mean, I just... I can't
believe I was so selfish.

348
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,055
It's-it's like Dylan just held
a mirror up to me,

349
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,392
and I could finally see how
poorly I'd been treating him.

350
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:21,362
I guess I didn't realize how
lucky I was to have Dylan back

351
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:24,598
in my life until I lost him
all over again.

352
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:25,933
Well, maybe you
should just apologize.

353
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,101
I tried to.

354
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:29,904
I mean, I texted him
"S-R-Y frowny face."

355
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:33,073
I mean, he knows that I'm sorry
and that I'm sad.

356
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:36,777
What are you guys
doing up so early?

357
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:37,878
What-what are we...

358
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:39,246
Where have you been?

359
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:42,283
Well, I certainly wasn't
at the Shriners' convention.

360
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:45,753
You know what
I think, Brian?

361
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:47,688
I think you've got to
get down to that set

362
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:49,857
and apologize
face-to-face.

363
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:51,325
You're right.

364
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:54,495
I just... I hope he's willing
to hear me out, you know?

365
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,397
I'm the worst father ever.

366
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:58,799
I'm even worse than
Marvin Gaye's dad.

367
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,401
Happy Father's Day, Dad.

368
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:03,671
Marvin, if this another
tie, I'm gonna kill you.

369
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:16,250
Well, looks like it's just
you and me, shadow.

370
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,187
Shadow!

371
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:27,494
Oh, hey, is, uh...
is Dylan back here?

372
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,830
Sorry, Brian, Dylan says he
doesn't want to see you anymore.

373
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:31,465
We're not allowed
to let you in.

374
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,300
Well, you know what?
I'm sorry, too.

375
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:35,569
For what?
For this!

376
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:39,473
Yeah, you know, you probably
would've had a better shot

377
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:40,808
if you hadn't yelled
"For this!"

378
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:42,176
You know,
that-that kind of telegraphed

379
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,510
what you were gonna do.

380
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:44,812
Ah, Stewie,
it's no use.

381
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,747
They're never
gonna let us in.

382
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,649
Well, maybe
<i>you</i> can't get in,

383
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:51,151
but I think I know
someone who can.

384
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:54,922
Zac Sawyer?

385
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,358
I'm Zac Sawyer. Say "when."

386
00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:58,625
Acting.

387
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,596
Singing: pop, classical,
light opera, Italian.

388
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,066
Dancing: classical, tap, jazz.

389
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:08,602
Horse riding.
Can I? Yes.

390
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,437
Accents: 13.

391
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:12,506
South American, South African,

392
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,808
British upper class,
British Cockney.

393
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,944
"What, Govnah?"
Somebody gonna stop me?

394
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:18,545
Fencing, nunchucks.

395
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,315
Driving?
Yes. Automatic and standard...

396
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:22,716
Okay, okay. Wow.

397
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:23,917
You're the worst.

398
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,719
Welcome aboard.

399
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:33,527
We now return to <i>The</i>
<i>Love Boat with Somali Pirates.</i>

400
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,229
I am the captain now.

401
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:36,797
Well, okay,
but that means

402
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:39,533
you're in charge of getting
Mr. Devlin to admit

403
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,035
that after 30 years,

404
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:43,971
he still loves
Mrs. Devlin very much.

405
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:46,473
That is not the captain's
responsibility!

406
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,509
Well, maybe not where
<i>you</i> come from,

407
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:50,344
but here on
the Love Boat...

408
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,648
Now, who is Mr. Devlin?

409
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:57,951
Try skinny-dipping with her
like when you were kids.

410
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,920
Hey, Lois, if I was
gonna kill myself,

411
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:02,489
do I slit my wrists
this way or this way?

412
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:04,925
Sideways for attention,
long way for results!

413
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,926
Meg is right.

414
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,394
Okay, I'll be in
the garage.

415
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:08,862
Peter, put that knife down.

416
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:10,364
Lois, I don't
have any friends!

417
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:11,565
So I'm gonna kill myself

418
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,567
and get a full page
in the yearbook.

419
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,302
Then they <i>can't</i>
ignore me.

420
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:16,370
Who's that?

421
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:18,005
I don't know.

422
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:24,411
Okay, Zac, remember,
your character's name

423
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:25,579
is Tevin Ashe-Taylor.

424
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:27,414
You surf
and enjoy surfing.

425
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:29,550
In this scene,
DJ Slopes is thinking

426
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:31,051
of quitting
the detective agency,

427
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:32,553
and you're like,
"No way."

428
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:33,854
Got it.

429
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:36,123
We're rolling!

430
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:38,325
Listen, Tevin, I think
I just need more time

431
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,860
to focus
on my snowboarding

432
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:41,628
and Web series
about energy drinks.

433
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:43,864
No, man, you got to stay
in the detective agency.

434
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:46,300
It's what your dad
would want.

435
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,268
What?
What are you talking about?

436
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:49,736
What the hell's
that new kid doing?

437
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:50,871
This isn't in the script.

438
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:52,372
I'm talking about your dad, DJ.

439
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:54,208
He sent me here with a message.

440
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:57,211
He said he can't believe
he was so selfish.

441
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:59,279
It's like you held
a mirror up to him

442
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:02,483
and he could finally see how
poorly he'd been treating you.

443
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:04,785
He didn't realize how lucky
he was...

444
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,587
Stay on me,
camera one.

445
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:08,789
...to have you
back in his life,

446
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:12,192
and now he feels like
he's lost you all over again.

447
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:15,329
But how do I know
he won't just hurt me again?

448
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:17,464
You don't. You never know that.

449
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:21,335
But isn't taking a risk
better than not having a dad?

450
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,537
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

451
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:26,039
You're damn right I am.

452
00:18:26,074 --> 00:18:27,407
Cut!

453
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:29,576
You know, I don't know
where any of that came from,

454
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:30,577
but I liked it.

455
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:31,678
Who are you?

456
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:33,280
I'm Zac Sawyer.

457
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:35,082
And I go where I'm needed.

458
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:39,853
♪ Here I go again on my own

459
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:44,191
♪ Going down the only road
I've ever known. ♪

460
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:45,759
Where you headed?

461
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,194
Wherever I'm needed.

462
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:48,962
No, no, it does
not work like that.

463
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,697
I need to put
address in machine.

464
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,133
Okay, maybe, you can
just take me home then.

465
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:54,134
Where is home?

466
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:55,569
I-I don't know.

467
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:57,271
It's-it's my mom
and dad's house,

468
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:58,872
but I don't
know the address!

469
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:00,073
I take you airport.

470
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:00,608
Okay!

471
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:07,648
All right, Quagmire, I have
given this a lot of thought.

472
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:09,783
I need you to shoot me
in the arm

473
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,218
so we can be friends again.

474
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:12,953
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

475
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:14,388
No, no, I was supposed
to offer,

476
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:16,390
and then you were supposed
to say, "No, Peter,

477
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:17,591
"I'm not gonna shoot you,

478
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,059
although I do appreciate
the gesture."

479
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,627
Hand me the gun, Peter.

480
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:23,130
I, uh... I passed the test?

481
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:25,899
No, Peter. I'm gonna shoot you
like a dirty animal.

482
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,100
But-but just the fact

483
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:29,336
that I would make the offer
is so meaningful to you.

484
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,470
Your offer means
nothing, Peter.

485
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:31,872
The only thing that
means anything to me

486
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:33,607
is a bullet in your arm.
Now give me that!

487
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:34,942
Stop! Stop!
Quagmire, let go!

488
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:36,310
Come on! You're not leaving
here without being shot!

489
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:37,678
Look, I was trying
to do the decent thing,

490
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:38,946
like you'd see in a movie!

491
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,180
I'm putting that bullet
in your arm, Peter!

492
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:41,915
Ah! Son of a bitch!

493
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,084
It's over.
We're all friends again.

494
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:45,319
What the hell, Joe?!

495
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:46,820
I'm just trying
to settle this nonsense.

496
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,088
Nothing got settled!
You shot him!

497
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:49,756
I'm the one who
has to shoot him!

498
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,326
Wait a second. All right, then
I get to shoot Joe, all right?

499
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,563
He shot me! I mean, if we're
doing things fair here, then...

500
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:58,765
All right, we're good.

501
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:04,771
Hey, Dad.

502
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:05,772
Dylan?

503
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:07,107
I went to your house,

504
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:08,809
and Chris told me
you'd be here.

505
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:11,545
Look, Dylan, I-I'm really sorry
I hurt you.

506
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,048
I've been a really bad father,
like Ernest Hemmingway

507
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,350
or-or some other great writer.

508
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:18,118
But if-if you'll give me
a chance,

509
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:20,148
I-I'd like
to try to change that.

510
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,050
I'd like that, too, Dad.

511
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,799
Peter, I'm so glad you patched
things up with your friends.

512
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,776
Have I told you
that we're all friends again?

513
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:43,366
Yes, Peter, we were just
talking about it.

514
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,130
They're gonna take me
to the zoo and roll me around.

515
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,347
We're all friends again.

516
