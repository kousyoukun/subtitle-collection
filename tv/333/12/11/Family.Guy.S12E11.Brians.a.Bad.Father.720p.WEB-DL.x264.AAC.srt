11
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,405
Ah, this hunting trip
is long overdue.

12
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,807
Yeah, I mean, it's just too bad
that all the-the animals

13
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,542
are so spread out, you know?

14
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,511
I mean, wouldn't it
be awesome if-if they were all

15
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,046
grouped together,
like in a cafeteria,

16
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,181
and you could just go in there
with a trench coat

17
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,416
and just waste them?

18
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:53,152
Well, maybe I can stir up
some quail or pheasant

19
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:55,387
with my patented
bird calls.

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,089
Birds! Quail! Pheasant!

21
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,724
Come on out!

22
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:02,594
I'm a bird of the opposite sex
who's interested in mating!

23
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,396
(gasps)
Did you hear that?

24
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,697
We're gonna get laid!

25
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,533
Billy, Billy, come on.

26
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:09,401
Don't be stupid.

27
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,248
Should've taken
the shot, fat-ass.

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,783
Ah, ah, ow!

29
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,753
(whimpering)

30
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,457
Hey, Peter, you got
your safety on, right?

31
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,791
Yeah, of course.

32
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,460
Okay, 'cause your gun is
pointing right at me.

33
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:35,594
Well, you want me
to pull the trigger

34
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,962
and prove it to you?

35
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,864
No, I just want to make
sure your safety's on.

36
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,032
(trigger clicks)
There. See, Quagmire?

37
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,100
Safety's on.

38
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:43,102
Now this is a gun
without a safety.

39
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,303
(screams)

40
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,471
Quite the difference, huh?

41
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:46,939
Damn it, Peter,
you son of a bitch!

42
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:47,940
You shot me!

43
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,241
Oh, my God, Peter!

44
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,143
That might be the dumbest
thing you've ever done.

45
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,778
No, the dumbest
thing I ever did

46
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,780
was open that
can of whup-ass.

47
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,418
(grunting)

48
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,253
Lois, why did you buy this?!

49
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,722
LOIS:
It was on sale!

50
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,263
A writer who inherits
a magic typewriter

51
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,599
that writes for him,

52
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:17,569
but then it turns out
the typewriter is... racist?

53
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,438
Totally makes sense.

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Older technology,
older world view.

55
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,442
And that is a good day.

56
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,110
I earned some banana bread.

57
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:26,845
(phone ringing)

58
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:27,846
Oh, crap.

59
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:28,847
It's Dylan.

60
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,649
Dylan? Your son?

61
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,784
I haven't heard you
mention him in ages.

62
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:36,088
Yeah, I-I decided to step away
from the whole situation.

63
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,290
The last thing he needs
is a father who's,

64
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,359
you know, sometimes
there, sometimes not.

65
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,928
Really? When-when was the part
when you were there?

66
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,296
Hey, if I
click "ignore,"

67
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,131
will he know that I'm
sending him to voice mail?

68
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,166
Hey, Dylan!

69
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,534
Hey, it's Stewie!

70
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,702
Yeah, I'm right here
with your dad!

71
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,805
Hey... hey, Dylan.

72
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:54,873
Hey, Dad!

73
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,275
I know we haven't
talked in a while,

74
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:58,677
but I'm calling because
I'm on my way to Quahog.

75
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,978
Oh, really?

76
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,547
W-When are you
getting here?

77
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:02,848
Tuesday...
Oh, don't
say Tuesday!

78
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,050
Aw, aw, I'm at the...
I'm at the...

79
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,885
I'm out at
the project all day.

80
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,887
Aw, hands on,
indispensable.

81
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,456
They-they need me there,
so, wow.

82
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,058
Rats. Bummer.

83
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,460
I can cover for you
at the project, Brian!

84
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,628
Go see your boy!

85
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,829
DYLAN:
Dad, who's your coworker?

86
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:18,797
He sounds nice.

87
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,332
He's widely disliked
here, but, uh...

88
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,967
I'll meet you Tuesday
at the coffee shop.

89
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,802
Sounds great.
I'll see you then.

90
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,871
Okay, b-bye.

91
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,539
See? Don't you feel better?

92
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,874
You're gonna go
to that lunch,

93
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,342
you're gonna reconnect
with your son.

94
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,343
It'll be great.

95
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,744
I don't know, Stewie.

96
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,246
Trust me, you should
take my advice.

97
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,215
I mean, I'm the guy
who told Michael Chiklis

98
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,749
to wear tight shirts.

99
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,351
I'll tell you
anything you want,

100
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,919
just get your boobs
out of my face!

101
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,655
You know the difference
between you and me, dirtbag?

102
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:47,659
No matter how muscular I get,
I will never be muscular.

103
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,599
Hey, Quagmire,
what's with the cast?

104
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:56,235
Did you hurt your arm after
I shot you in the arm?

105
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,103
The shooting was
the injury, Peter!

106
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,672
Look, I already said I was
sorry, like, a hundred times.

107
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,108
Oh, and before I forget,
I want my Huey Lewis CD back.

108
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,443
Well, I want a new drug.

109
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,844
Okay, at least
you've been using it.

110
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,012
But I want
it back, Peter.

111
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:07,913
This is it.
Ooh-ah.

112
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,248
Damn it, Peter,
just give it back.

113
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,550
I can't give it back.
I lost it in a poker game.

114
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,385
What?
I didn't think
he could beat a two.

115
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,720
Where the hell
do you get off

116
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,421
betting my CD
in a poker game?

117
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,923
I don't think
I like your tone.

118
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,026
W-What? You're-you're saying
I'm being the unreasonable one?!

119
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,427
Geez, calm down,
you guys.

120
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,729
No, no, Joe, Joe, Joe,

121
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,197
it's time somebody
said this to him.

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,633
Peter Griffin,
you are an idiot!

123
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:30,435
You can't even walk
and chew gum at the same time.

124
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,404
Peter, come on!

125
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,472
Walk over here.

126
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:34,606
(chewing)

127
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,907
I'm doing something.

128
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,143
One thing at a time.

129
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,311
Damn it, Peter, that's it!

130
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,146
I am done!
I'm done with you!

131
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,447
I'm done with
all your crap!

132
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,915
I never want to
speak to you again!

133
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,584
This friendship is over!

134
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,585
Well, fine!

135
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:47,719
I don't need your friendship!

136
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,987
I got other friends.

137
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,956
I got my silent movie friends.

138
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,958
(tinny piano music playing)

139
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,284
Coming up, we'll meet
a Filipino man

140
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,453
who actually has
a grown-up haircut.

141
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,121
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

142
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,023
Aren't you supposed to be
having lunch with Dylan?

143
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,192
Yeah, you know, Stewie,
I've been thinking about it.

144
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,127
And I haven't seen
him in years,

145
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,330
and at this point,
I-I just don't see

146
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,764
what could possibly
be gained

147
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,132
from me getting
together with him.

148
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,835
In entertainment news,
Hollywood comes to Quahog

149
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,804
in the form of a new
Disney Channel show

150
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,539
called <i>Parent Boppers,</i>

151
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,307
about a group of
teen detectives.

152
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,776
The show, set and filmed
right here in Rhode Island,

153
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:48,680
stars local teen and
Irish trash Dylan Flannigan.

154
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,048
Brian, did you hear that?

155
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,384
Your son's gonna be a TV star!

156
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,119
Brian?

157
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,188
(engine revs, tires squeal)

158
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,690
He's off to lunch, Meg.

159
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,892
Oh, that dog o' mine!

160
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,394
That's Mike Drunkbeater.

161
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:03,562
Look it up on the Internet.

162
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,731
(man singing):

163
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,877
Wow, my son Dylan
on a TV show.

164
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,012
Funny how life
turns out, isn't it?

165
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,181
You remember that weekend
we watched TV together?

166
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,852
Boy, little did I know
how much that was gonna rub off.

167
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,320
Did we watch
TV together?

168
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,489
Oh, probably.
But, wow, huh?

169
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,990
And-and you know what's weird?

170
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,426
You're on a show...
I'm a writer.

171
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,728
It's-it's almost like
the universe is trying to...

172
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,330
(chuckling):
...I don't know,

173
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,332
make us work together
or something, I don't know.

174
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,934
You... you want
a job on my show?

175
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,736
Hey, hey, don't put
the universe's words

176
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,937
in my mouth, okay?

177
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,439
I don't know, Dad.

178
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,408
I've-I've barely seen you
in the past few years.

179
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,376
So, what better way
to reconnect

180
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,044
than by working
together every day?

181
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,513
Well, I suppose
I could talk to them,

182
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,680
see if they'd
go for it.

183
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:56,681
Why wouldn't they?

184
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,016
I-I mean,
it wouldn't be

185
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,851
the craziest idea
in show business.

186
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:00,752
When I grow up,

187
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,721
I want to stick my head
through a circle

188
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,589
at the beginning
of movies and roar.

189
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,691
(laughter)

190
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,795
What's up now, bitches?!

191
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,634
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to
<i>Saving Private Ryan,</i>

192
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,402
brought to you without
commercial interruption

193
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,770
by Mazda.

194
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,539
(men grunting,
gunfire in distance)

195
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,848
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

196
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,718
(whispering):
Zoom zoom.

197
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,326
Hey, Jerome, can you
clear out my booth?

198
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,662
Looks like somebody
left their trash here.

199
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,931
Jerome, can you tell
that (bleep) (bleep) (bleep)

200
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,332
to (bleep) get
the hell out of here

201
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,967
before I (bleep)
kick him in the face?

202
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,503
Peter, why don't you just sit
in that booth over there?

203
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,172
Oh, man, that's where the
after-work secretaries sit.

204
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,843
What about Mr. Demerson?
Is he single?

205
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,511
I... I-I don't know.

206
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,179
What about Mr. Adelaide?
Is he single?

207
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,747
I don't know
who that is.

208
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,616
Well, who do you know
who is single?

209
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,618
Uh, I'm assuming you.

210
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,353
Oh-oh, hey, look! Cake!

211
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,258
Hey, Joe!
Hey, Joe, I'm over here!

212
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,359
Joe! Joe!
Come sit with me!

213
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,961
Come on, you guys.

214
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,696
Joe, I got a box of
salt water taffies,

215
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:18,864
and you can have two.

216
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:19,965
Joe, I got
a deck of cards

217
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,299
you can put in your
wheels to look cool.

218
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,468
Joe, I'll do the wavy
stomach for you.

219
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,537
(chuckles)
Looks like a real wave.

220
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,439
Joe, I can scream
your name real loud!

221
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,975
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!

222
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,042
I can yell it louder!

223
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,545
Joe! Joe! Joe!

224
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:37,015
Joe! Joe!
Joe! Joe!
Joe! Joe!
Joe! Joe! Joe!

225
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,017
What the hell
is going on here?!

226
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,719
I'm in there trying
to take a leak!

227
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,320
What, you think
I'm here to amuse you?

228
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,523
You made me dribble
on my Bruno Maglis

229
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,558
turning to see
who's calling my name!

230
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Joe Pesci thought we were
talking to him

231
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,228
'cause his name is Joe.

232
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,131
Oh, you don't know who
Joe Pesci is, 'cause you're 14.

233
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,868
You see, in the '90s,
this was a tough guy.

234
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,576
Hey, multiracial
group of friends,

235
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,011
you want to hang out?

236
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,679
Cut! That's a five.

237
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,915
Tell my assistant I fell asleep
with a condom on again,

238
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,917
and to bring scissors
to my trailer.

239
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,187
All right, guys,
before we begin today,

240
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:19,324
I want to introduce our newest
staff writer, Brian Griffin.

241
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,358
Hi, guys.

242
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,093
Yes, I am that Brian Griffin.

243
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,230
You probably have my novel,
but just so you know, in here,

244
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,432
I'm just one of
the guys, all right?

245
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,401
You have my novel, right?

246
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,602
Nope? No?

247
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,237
You got it, though.
Nope?

248
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,271
You got it?

249
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,106
Nope, nobody's got it.

250
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,441
All right.

251
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,243
Okay, so we got to
come up with a story

252
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,344
for next week's episode.

253
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,545
How about we do one

254
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,947
where DJ gets his
driver's license?

255
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,682
That could work.
I don't think
we've done that.

256
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:44,683
Love that idea.

257
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:45,784
No, no, no.

258
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,953
Guys, guys, come on,
where's the STWISTUSION?

259
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,755
Really?
Really?

260
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,390
I'm the only guy here
who's heard of that?

261
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,427
Stakes, twists, conclusion--
STWISTUSION.

262
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,062
That sounds made up.

263
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,230
Let me ask you something:
are you afraid right now?

264
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,465
What? No.

265
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,700
That's what's wrong.

266
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,401
You should be, you know?

267
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,636
Art is scary.

268
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,737
This is writing, man.

269
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,105
The viewer wants to be raped.

270
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,874
Are you saying my nine-year-old
daughter wants to be raped?

271
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,910
Now you're asking
the right questions.

272
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,813
Now you're being creative,
thinking outside the box.

273
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,616
Take what you think you know
and go a different way with it.

274
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,151
Like-like, for instance,
what if the daughter in <i>Taken</i>

275
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,287
was Zooey Deschanel?

276
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,623
Send me her head.

277
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,328
Peter, Quagmire, I've
called you here today

278
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,130
because this
has got to stop.

279
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,332
The petty vying
for my attention,

280
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:37,435
the late-night phone
calls, the attack ads.

281
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,337
NARRATOR:
<i>Glenn Quagmire claims to be</i>

282
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,805
<i>Joe Swanson's good friend.</i>

283
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,175
<i>But would a "good friend"</i>
<i>not return a leaf blower</i>

284
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:47,078
<i>for four months</i>
<i>during the leafy season?</i>

285
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,313
I'm Peter Griffin,

286
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,515
and I broke into a news station
to make this.

287
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,950
MAN:
Hey, who's that guy?

288
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,284
(gasps)

289
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,686
(static crackling)

290
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,856
Well, look, you guys have
given me no alternative.

291
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,491
I have to choose
one of you.

292
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,525
So I choose Quagmire.

293
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,127
What?!
Suck it!

294
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,361
I'm sorry, Peter,

295
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,829
it's just that
Quagmire's been there

296
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,498
for me in some
pretty dark days.

297
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,933
And he's been a wonderful
godfather to Susie.

298
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,035
(girl giggles)

299
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,770
There she is,
my little Susie-woozie!

300
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,338
(both laugh)

301
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,974
I love Susie more!
Come here, Susie!

302
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,476
Uncle Peter's gonna
give you a raspberry.

303
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,478
(blows raspberry)

304
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,648
Peter, that's not
where you do a raspberry.

305
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,017
I closed my eyes too early.

306
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,986
I think it's best
if you leave.

307
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,220
Oh, yeah?

308
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,523
Well, maybe I'll hang out
with my godson, Kevin.

309
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,158
KEVIN:
Get out!

310
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,360
He was masturbating
with a knife.

311
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,132
We're rolling!

312
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,335
My stupid parents want me
to wear a bike helmet.

313
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,970
Parents are lame.

314
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,006
Hold on, other kids.
Maybe they just recognize

315
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,241
that nothing can protect us
from the tedium

316
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,676
of our mundane lives.

317
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,179
Aren't we all on bikes
without helmets?

318
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,915
Sometimes I just want
to put this gun in my mouth.

319
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:00,051
Cut! Your line is
"That's right, Cameron."

320
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,053
I know. My dad wrote
that one for me.

321
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,354
Again with this?

322
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,923
Yesterday, you had
Dakota give herself

323
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,826
an abdomen-punch abortion during
her volleyball tournament.

324
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,761
Hey, seventh grade
can be hell.

325
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:10,929
Brian, you're fired.

326
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:11,930
Wait, what?!

327
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,498
Sorry, Brian,
but you're done.

328
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,367
Oh, come on! You can't fire a
writer in the middle of a show!

329
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,869
That would be like
a doctor leaving

330
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,104
in the middle
of a surgery!

331
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,371
(monitor beeping steadily)

332
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,773
Help!

333
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,342
I'm supposed to have surgery,
but my doctor disappeared.

334
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,746
Okay, Josh, this is the shot
you've been waiting for.

335
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,183
Okay, Derek,
this is the shot

336
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,018
you've been waiting for.

337
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,255
Dylan, Dylan,
there you are!

338
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,790
Listen, you can't
let them fire me!

339
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,225
You're the star
of the show!

340
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,761
Dad, believe me, I want
you to work here with me,

341
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,462
but you can't keep
doing things like that.

342
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,930
And they know
you took those cases

343
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,365
of Diet Coke
home last night.

344
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,067
I thought they were
anybody's Diet Coke!

345
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,568
They're for work!
I work at home!

346
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,771
Oh, hey, by the way, are we all
getting those backpacks

347
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,439
with the name
of the show on them?

348
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,774
You know what, Dad?

349
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,408
I'm starting to think
that you've just been

350
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,477
using me to advance
your career!

351
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,813
God! You're
a terrible father!

352
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,982
I never want to
see you again!

353
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,618
(sighs)

354
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,886
My God, he's right.

355
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:11,156
I  <i>am</i>a terrible father.

356
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,045
(backup alarm beeps)

357
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,302
Brian, do you
know where...

358
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,204
What the hell
are you drinking?

359
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,206
Is that Rite Aid-
brand whiskey?

360
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,540
(sighs)

361
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,844
Stewie, I just feel so awful
about what happened with Dylan.

362
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,446
I mean, every terrible thing
he said about me is true.

363
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,281
Well, you're
a terrible guy, Bri.

364
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:13,384
I think being a paid writer
again just went to my head.

365
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,354
I mean, I just... I can't
believe I was so selfish.

366
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,990
It's-it's like Dylan just held
a mirror up to me,

367
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:22,227
and I could finally see how
poorly I'd been treating him.

368
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,330
I guess I didn't realize how
lucky I was to have Dylan back

369
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:28,466
in my life until I lost him
all over again.

370
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,868
Well, maybe you
should just apologize.

371
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,969
I tried to.

372
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,838
I mean, I texted him
"S-R-Y frowny face."

373
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,075
I mean, he knows that I'm sorry
and that I'm sad.

374
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,712
(gasps) What are you guys
doing up so early?

375
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,746
What-what are we...

376
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,081
Where have you been?

377
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,251
Well, I certainly wasn't
at the Shriners' convention.

378
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,587
You know what
I think, Brian?

379
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,656
I think you've got to
get down to that set

380
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,825
and apologize
face-to-face.

381
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,260
(sighs) You're right.

382
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:58,363
I just... I hope he's willing
to hear me out, you know?

383
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,265
(groans)
I'm the worst father ever.

384
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,667
I'm even worse than
Marvin Gaye's dad.

385
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,269
Happy Father's Day, Dad.

386
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,639
Marvin, if this another
tie, I'm gonna kill you.

387
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,251
Well, looks like it's just
you and me, shadow.

388
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,155
CROWD:
Shadow!

389
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,362
Oh, hey, is, uh...
is Dylan back here?

390
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,698
Sorry, Brian, Dylan says he
doesn't want to see you anymore.

391
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,400
We're not allowed
to let you in.

392
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,235
Well, you know what?
I'm sorry, too.

393
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,437
For what?
For this!

394
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,272
(grunts)

395
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,408
Yeah, you know, you probably
would've had a better shot

396
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,742
if you hadn't yelled
"For this!"

397
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,110
You know,
that-that kind of telegraphed

398
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,378
what you were gonna do.

399
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,646
Ah, Stewie,
it's no use.

400
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,715
They're never
gonna let us in.

401
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,483
Well, maybe
<i>you</i> can't get in,

402
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,153
but I think I know
someone who can.

403
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,890
Zac Sawyer?

404
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:01,292
I'm Zac Sawyer. Say "when."

405
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,593
Acting.

406
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:06,464
Singing: pop, classical,
light opera, Italian.

407
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,001
Dancing: classical, tap, jazz.

408
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,470
Horse riding.
Can I? Yes.

409
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,305
Accents: 13.

410
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,341
South American, South African,

411
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,776
British upper class,
British Cockney.

412
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,912
"What, Govnah?"
Somebody gonna stop me?

413
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,413
Fencing, nunchucks.

414
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,183
Driving?
Yes. Automatic and standard...

415
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,651
Okay, okay. Wow.

416
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,852
You're the worst.

417
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,687
Welcome aboard.

418
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:37,462
ANNOUNCER: We now return to <i>The</i>
<i>Love Boat with Somali Pirates.</i>

419
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,097
I am the captain now.

420
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,765
Well, okay,
but that means

421
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,368
you're in charge of getting
Mr. Devlin to admit

422
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,869
that after 30 years,

423
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,939
he still loves
Mrs. Devlin very much.

424
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,341
That is not the captain's
responsibility!

425
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,377
Well, maybe not where
<i>you</i> come from,

426
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,345
but here on
the Love Boat...

427
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,516
Now, who is Mr. Devlin?

428
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,819
Try skinny-dipping with her
like when you were kids.

429
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,855
Hey, Lois, if I was
gonna kill myself,

430
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,457
do I slit my wrists
this way or this way?

431
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,860
MEG: Sideways for attention,
long way for results!

432
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,861
Meg is right.

433
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,329
Okay, I'll be in
the garage.

434
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,830
Peter, put that knife down.

435
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,232
Lois, I don't
have any friends!

436
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,400
So I'm gonna kill myself

437
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,402
and get a full page
in the yearbook.

438
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,237
Then they <i>can't</i>
<i>ignore me.</i>

439
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,338
Who's that?

440
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,973
I don't know.

441
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,346
Okay, Zac, remember,
your character's name

442
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,414
is Tevin Ashe-Taylor.

443
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,349
You surf
and enjoy surfing.

444
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,518
In this scene,
DJ Slopes is thinking

445
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,019
of quitting
the detective agency,

446
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,521
and you're like,
"No way."

447
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,822
Got it.

448
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,058
We're rolling!

449
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,193
Listen, Tevin, I think
I just need more time

450
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,728
to focus
on my snowboarding

451
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,496
and Web series
about energy drinks.

452
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,832
No, man, you got to stay
in the detective agency.

453
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,234
It's what your dad
would want.

454
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,203
What?
What are you talking about?

455
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,704
What the hell's
that new kid doing?

456
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,839
This isn't in the script.

457
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,340
I'm talking about your dad, DJ.

458
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,076
He sent me here with a message.

459
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,079
He said he can't believe
he was so selfish.

460
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,114
It's like you held
a mirror up to him

461
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,417
and he could finally see how
poorly he'd been treating you.

462
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,719
He didn't realize how lucky
he was...

463
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,555
Stay on me,
camera one.

464
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,723
...to have you
back in his life,

465
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:16,060
and now he feels like
he's lost you all over again.

466
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:19,263
But how do I know
he won't just hurt me again?

467
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,399
You don't. You never know that.

468
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:25,269
But isn't taking a risk
better than not having a dad?

469
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,472
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

470
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,907
You're damn right I am.

471
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,275
Cut!

472
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,544
You know, I don't know
where any of that came from,

473
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,445
but I liked it.

474
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,613
Who are you?

475
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,148
I'm Zac Sawyer.

476
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,950
And I go where I'm needed.

477
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:43,721
♪ Here I go again on my own

478
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:48,126
♪ Going down the only road
I've ever known. ♪

479
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,627
Where you headed?

480
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,129
Wherever I'm needed.

481
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,930
No, no, it does
not work like that.

482
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,632
I need to put
address in machine.

483
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,001
Okay, maybe, you can
just take me home then.

484
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,102
Where is home?

485
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,437
I-I don't know.

486
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,239
It's-it's my mom
and dad's house,

487
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,807
but I don't
know the address!

488
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,008
I take you airport.

489
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,576
Okay!

490
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,516
All right, Quagmire, I have
given this a lot of thought.

491
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,751
I need you to shoot me
in the arm

492
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,153
so we can be friends again.

493
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,921
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

494
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,322
No, no, I was supposed
to offer,

495
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,324
and then you were supposed
to say, "No, Peter,

496
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,526
"I'm not gonna shoot you,

497
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,994
although I do appreciate
the gesture."

498
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,595
Hand me the gun, Peter.

499
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,998
I, uh... I passed the test?

500
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,834
No, Peter. I'm gonna shoot you
like a dirty animal.

501
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:30,968
But-but just the fact

502
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,304
that I would make the offer
is so meaningful to you.

503
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,338
Your offer means
nothing, Peter.

504
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,806
The only thing that
means anything to me

505
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,542
is a bullet in your arm.
Now give me that!

506
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:38,809
Stop! Stop!
Quagmire, let go!

507
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,278
Come on! You're not leaving
here without being shot!

508
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,546
Look, I was trying
to do the decent thing,

509
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:42,880
like you'd see in a movie!

510
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,148
I'm putting that bullet
in your arm, Peter!

511
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,783
Ah! Son of a bitch!

512
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,952
It's over.
We're all friends again.

513
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,187
What the hell, Joe?!

514
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,788
I'm just trying
to settle this nonsense.

515
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,023
Nothing got settled!
You shot him!

516
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,624
I'm the one who
has to shoot him!

517
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,294
Wait a second. All right, then
I get to shoot Joe, all right?

518
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:00,398
He shot me! I mean, if we're
doing things fair here, then...

519
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,733
All right, we're good.

520
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,639
Hey, Dad.

521
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,707
Dylan?

522
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,975
I went to your house,

523
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,743
and Chris told me
you'd be here.

524
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,413
Look, Dylan, I-I'm really sorry
I hurt you.

525
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,916
I've been a really bad father,
like Ernest Hemmingway

526
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,318
or-or some other great writer.

527
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,986
But if-if you'll give me
a chance,

528
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,555
I-I'd like
to try to change that.

529
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,591
I'd like that, too, Dad.

530
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,340
Peter, I'm so glad you patched
things up with your friends.

531
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,109
(slurring): Have I told you
that we're all friends again?

532
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,878
Yes, Peter, we were just
talking about it.

533
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,550
They're gonna take me
to the zoo and roll me around.

534
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,086
We're all friends again.
