12
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:38,394
Ah, this hunting trip
is long overdue.

13
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,797
Yeah, I mean, it's just too bad
that all the-the animals

14
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,532
are so spread out, you know?

15
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:44,526
I mean, wouldn't it
be awesome if-if they were all

16
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:46,035
grouped together,
like in a cafeteria,

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,171
and you could just go in there
with a trench coat

18
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:49,405
and just waste them?

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,041
Well, maybe I can stir up
some quail or pheasant

20
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:54,310
with my patented
bird calls.

21
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,045
Birds! Quail! Pheasant!

22
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,613
Come on out!

23
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:01,551
I'm a bird of the opposite sex
who's interested in mating!

24
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:03,286
Did you hear that?

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,654
We're gonna get laid!

26
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:06,489
Billy, Billy, come on.

27
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:08,224
Don't be stupid.

28
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,138
Should've taken
the shot, fat-ass.

29
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:23,773
Ah, ah, ow!

30
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:30,413
Hey, Peter, you got
your safety on, right?

31
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:31,681
Yeah, of course.

32
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,349
Okay, 'cause your gun is
pointing right at me.

33
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,550
Well, you want me
to pull the trigger

34
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:35,918
and prove it to you?

35
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:37,754
No, I just want to make
sure your safety's on.

36
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:38,988
There. See, Quagmire?

37
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:39,989
Safety's on.

38
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:41,991
Now this is a gun
without a safety.

39
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:44,367
Quite the difference, huh?

40
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,895
Damn it, Peter,
you son of a bitch!

41
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:46,896
You shot me!

42
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,131
Oh, my God, Peter!

43
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:50,133
That might be the dumbest
thing you've ever done.

44
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,734
No, the dumbest
thing I ever did

45
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,603
was open that
can of whup-ass.

46
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,109
Lois, why did you buy this?!

47
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:02,578
It was on sale!

48
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,219
A writer who inherits
a magic typewriter

49
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:12,555
that writes for him,

50
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:16,526
but then it turns out
the typewriter is... racist?

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,327
Totally makes sense.

52
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:20,329
Older technology,
older world view.

53
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:22,298
And that is a good day.

54
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:23,966
I earned some banana bread.

55
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:26,736
Oh, crap.

56
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,837
It's Dylan.

57
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,605
Dylan? Your son?

58
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,674
I haven't heard you
mention him in ages.

59
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:35,077
Yeah, I-I decided to step away
from the whole situation.

60
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:37,213
The last thing he needs
is a father who's,

61
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:39,382
you know, sometimes
there, sometimes not.

62
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,818
Really? When-when was the part
when you were there?

63
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:43,286
Hey, if I
click "ignore,"

64
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,054
will he know that I'm
sending him to voice mail?

65
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,088
Hey, Dylan!

66
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:47,557
Hey, it's Stewie!

67
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:49,592
Yeah, I'm right here
with your dad!

68
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:52,728
Hey... hey, Dylan.

69
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:53,863
Hey, Dad!

70
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:55,297
I know we haven't
talked in a while,

71
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,600
but I'm calling because
I'm on my way to Quahog.

72
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:58,901
Oh, really?

73
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,570
W-When are you
getting here?

74
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:01,771
Tuesday...
Oh, don't say Tuesday!

75
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:04,073
Aw, aw, I'm at the...
I'm at the...

76
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:05,908
I'm out at
the project all day.

77
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:07,910
Aw, hands on,
indispensable.

78
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:10,346
They-they need me there,
so, wow.

79
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,081
Rats. Bummer.

80
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:14,450
I can cover for you
at the project, Brian!

81
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,518
Go see your boy!

82
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,752
Dad, who's your coworker?

83
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:17,787
He sounds nice.

84
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:19,222
He's widely disliked
here, but, uh...

85
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:20,957
I'll meet you Tuesday
at the coffee shop.

86
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:22,792
Sounds great.
I'll see you then.

87
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,794
Okay, b-bye.

88
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:26,529
See? Don't you feel better?

89
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:27,864
You're gonna go
to that lunch,

90
00:03:27,898 --> 00:03:29,265
you're gonna reconnect
with your son.

91
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:30,266
It'll be great.

92
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,667
I don't know, Stewie.

93
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:33,269
Trust me, you should
take my advice.

94
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:35,137
I mean, I'm the guy
who told Michael Chiklis

95
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:36,739
to wear tight shirts.

96
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,241
I'll tell you
anything you want,

97
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,909
just get your boob
out of my face!

98
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:42,512
You know the difference
between you and me, dirtbag?

99
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:46,516
No matter how muscular I get,
I will never be muscular.

100
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:52,555
Hey, Quagmire,
what's with the cast?

101
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:55,191
Did you hurt your arm after
I shot you in the arm?

102
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:56,993
The shooting was
the injury, Peter!

103
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,529
Look, I already said I was
sorry, like, a hundred times.

104
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:02,064
Oh, and before I forget,
I want my Huey Lewis CD back.

105
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,332
Well, I want a new drug.

106
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:04,700
Okay, at least
you've been using it.

107
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:05,868
But I want
it back, Peter.

108
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:06,869
This is it.
Ooh-ah.

109
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:08,225
Damn it, Peter,
just give it back.

110
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:10,506
I can't give it back.
I lost it in a poker game.

111
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,341
What?
I didn't think he could beat a two.

112
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:13,676
Where the hell
do you get off

113
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,311
betting my CD
in a poker game?

114
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:16,879
I don't think
I like your tone.

115
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:19,882
W-What? You're-you're saying
I'm being the unreasonable one?!

116
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:21,384
Jeez, calm down,
you guys.

117
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,585
No, no, Joe, Joe, Joe,

118
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:24,053
it's time somebody
said this to him.

119
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:26,589
Peter Griffin,
you are an idiot!

120
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:29,325
You can't even walk
and chew gum at the same time.

121
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,294
Peter, come on!

122
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:32,361
Walk over here.

123
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:34,864
I'm doing something.

124
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:37,133
One thing at a time.

125
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,301
Damn it, Peter, that's it!

126
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:40,102
I am done!
I'm done with you!

127
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:41,337
I'm done with
all your crap!

128
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:42,872
I never want to
speak to you again!

129
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,473
This friendship is over!

130
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:45,474
Well, fine!

131
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:46,676
I don't need your friendship!

132
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,944
I got other friends.

133
00:04:47,978 --> 00:04:49,845
I got my silent movie friends.

134
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:18,174
Coming up, we'll meet
a Filipino man

135
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,309
who actually has
a grown-up haircut.

136
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:22,078
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

137
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:24,013
Aren't you supposed to be
having lunch with Dylan?

138
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,087
Yeah, you know, Stewie,
I've been thinking about it.

139
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:28,084
And I haven't seen
him in years,

140
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:30,219
and at this point,
I-I just don't see

141
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:31,721
what could possibly
be gained

142
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:32,989
from me getting
together with him.

143
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:35,725
In entertainment news,
Hollywood comes to Quahog

144
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,693
in the form of a new
Disney Channel show

145
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,528
called <i>Parent Boppers,</i>

146
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:41,197
about a group of
teen detectives.

147
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,733
The show, set and filmed
right here in Rhode Island,

148
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:47,570
stars local teen and
Irish trash Dylan Flannigan.

149
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:49,038
Brian, did you hear that?

150
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:51,340
Your son's gonna be a TV star!

151
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,975
Brian?

152
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:57,580
He's off to lunch, Meg.

153
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:59,849
Oh, that dog o' mine!

154
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:01,283
That's Mike Drunkbeater.

155
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:02,551
Look it up on the Internet.

156
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,091
Wow, my son Dylan
on a TV show.

157
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,159
Funny how life
turns out, isn't it?

158
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:20,395
You remember that weekend
we watched TV together?

159
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:24,065
Boy, little did I know
how much that was gonna rub off.

160
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,533
Did we watch
TV together?

161
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:27,702
Oh, probably.
But, wow, huh?

162
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:29,104
And-and you know what's weird?

163
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,673
You're on a show...
I'm a writer.

164
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:33,942
It's-it's almost like
the universe is trying to...

165
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,443
...I don't know,

166
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,445
make us work together
or something, I don't know.

167
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,181
You... you want
a job on my show?

168
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:41,950
Hey, hey, don't put
the universe's words

169
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,184
in my mouth, okay?

170
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,686
I don't know, Dad.

171
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,621
I've-I've barely seen you
in the past few years.

172
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,490
So, what better way
to reconnect

173
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:50,158
than by working
together every day?

174
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:51,726
Well, I suppose
I could talk to them,

175
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,894
see if they'd
go for it.

176
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:53,895
Why wouldn't they?

177
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:55,130
I-I mean,
it wouldn't be

178
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,965
the craziest idea
in show business.

179
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,966
When I grow up,

180
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,834
I want to stick my head
through a circle

181
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:01,803
at the beginning
of movies and roar.

182
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:06,875
What's up now, bitches?!

183
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:12,814
We now return to
<i>Saving Private Ryan,</i>

184
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,549
brought to you without
commercial interruption

185
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,017
by Mazda.

186
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,995
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

187
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:30,865
Zoom zoom.

188
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,573
Hey, Jerome, can you
clear out my booth?

189
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:40,875
Looks like somebody
left their trash here.

190
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,144
Jerome, can you tell
that

191
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:44,479
to  get
the hell out of here

192
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:46,114
before I
kick him in the face?

193
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:48,650
Peter, why don't you just sit
in that booth over there?

194
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:51,252
Oh, man, that's where the
after-work secretaries sit.

195
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,089
What about Mr. Demerson?
Is he single?

196
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:56,658
I... I-I don't know.

197
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,426
What about Mr. Adelaide?
Is he single?

198
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,961
I don't know
who that is.

199
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:01,763
Well, who do you know
who is single?

200
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:03,765
Uh, I'm assuming you.

201
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,433
Oh-oh, hey, look! Cake!

202
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:10,371
Hey, Joe!
Hey, Joe, I'm over here!

203
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,606
Joe! Joe!
Come sit with me!

204
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,107
Come on, you guys.

205
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:14,842
Joe, I got a box of
salt water taffies,

206
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:16,010
and you can have two.

207
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:17,178
Joe, I got
a deck of cards

208
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:18,513
you can put in your
wheels to look cool.

209
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:20,615
Joe, I'll do the wavy
stomach for you.

210
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,784
Looks like a real wave.

211
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:24,552
Joe, I can scream
your name real loud!

212
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,121
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!

213
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:28,256
I can yell it louder!

214
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,792
Joe! Joe! Joe!

215
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:34,262
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!

216
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,197
What the hell
is going on here?!

217
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,999
I'm in there trying
to take a leak!

218
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,567
What, you think
I'm here to amuse you?

219
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,769
You made me dribble
on my Bruno Maglis

220
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,805
turning to see
who's calling my name!

221
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,740
Joe Pesci thought we were
talking to him

222
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:47,408
'cause his name is Joe.

223
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,278
Oh, you don't know who
Joe Pesci is, 'cause you're 14.

224
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:53,982
You see, in the '90s,
this was a tough guy.

225
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:01,723
Hey, multiracial
group of friends,

226
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,124
you want to hang out?

227
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:04,792
Cut! That's a five.

228
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:07,128
Tell my assistant I fell asleep
with a condom on again,

229
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:09,030
and to bring scissors
to my trailer.

230
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,401
All right, guys,
before we begin today,

231
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:16,437
I want to introduce our newest
staff writer, Brian Griffin.

232
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,472
Hi, guys.

233
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,307
Yes, I am that Brian Griffin.

234
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:22,443
You probably have my novel,
but just so you know, in here,

235
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,579
I'm just one of
the guys, all right?

236
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,547
You have my novel, right?

237
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:27,749
Nope? No?

238
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:29,384
You got it, though.
Nope?

239
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:30,485
You got it?

240
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,353
Nope, nobody's got it.

241
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,688
All right.

242
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,456
Okay, so we got to
come up with a story

243
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,457
for next week's episode.

244
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,692
How about we do one

245
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:39,193
where DJ gets his
driver's license?

246
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:40,795
That could work.
I don't think we've done that.

247
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:41,796
Love that idea.

248
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,997
No, no, no.

249
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:45,033
Guys, guys, come on,
where's the STWISTUSION?

250
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:47,969
Really?
Really?

251
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,604
I'm the only guy here
who's heard of that?

252
00:09:49,638 --> 00:09:52,640
Stakes, twists, conclusion--
STWISTUSION.

253
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,208
That sounds made up.

254
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:56,377
Let me ask you something:
are you afraid right now?

255
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:57,712
What? No.

256
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:58,913
That's what's wrong.

257
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:00,515
You should be, you know?

258
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:01,783
Art is scary.

259
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:02,884
This is writing, man.

260
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,252
The viewer wants to be raped.

261
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:07,088
Are you saying my nine-year-old
daughter wants to be raped?

262
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:09,023
Now you're asking
the right questions.

263
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:11,959
Now you're being creative,
thinking outside the box.

264
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:14,762
Take what you think you know
and go a different way with it.

265
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:17,398
Like-like, for instance,
what if the daughter in <i>Taken</i>

266
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,434
was Zooey Deschanel?

267
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:21,703
Send me her head.

268
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,575
Peter, Quagmire, I've
called you here today

269
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,277
because this
has got to stop.

270
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:31,579
The petty vying
for my attention,

271
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:34,549
the late-night phone
calls, the attack ads.

272
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,551
<i>Glenn Quagmire claims to be</i>

273
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,019
<i>Joe Swanson's good friend.</i>

274
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:41,389
<i>But would a "good friend"</i>
<i>not return a leaf blower</i>

275
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:44,292
<i>for four months</i>
<i>during the leafy season?</i>

276
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:45,460
I'm Peter Griffin,

277
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:47,762
and I broke into a news station
to make this.

278
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:49,097
Hey, who's that guy?

279
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:55,002
Well, look, you guys have
given me no alternative.

280
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:56,637
I have to choose
one of you.

281
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:57,739
So I choose Quagmire.

282
00:10:57,773 --> 00:10:59,273
What?!
Suck it!

283
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:00,508
I'm sorry, Peter,

284
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:01,976
it's just that
Quagmire's been there

285
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,644
for me in some
pretty dark days.

286
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,147
And he's been a wonderful
godfather to Susie.

287
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:08,983
There she is,
my little Susie-woozie!

288
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,087
I love Susie more!
Come here, Susie!

289
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:15,590
Uncle Peter's gonna
give you a raspberry.

290
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:20,762
Peter, that's not
where you do a raspberry.

291
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,164
I closed my eyes too early.

292
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:25,133
I think it's best
if you leave.

293
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,467
Oh, yeah?

294
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:28,736
Well, maybe I'll hang out
with my godson, Kevin.

295
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,304
Get out!

296
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:32,440
He was masturbating
with a knife.

297
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,346
We're rolling!

298
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,482
My stupid parents want me
to wear a bike helmet.

299
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:43,084
Parents are lame.

300
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,119
Hold on, other kids.
Maybe they just recognize

301
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:47,388
that nothing can protect us
from the tedium

302
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:48,890
of our mundane lives.

303
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:51,392
Aren't we all on bikes
without helmets?

304
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:54,128
Sometimes I just want
to put this gun in my mouth.

305
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:57,265
Cut! Your line is
"That's right, Cameron."

306
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,267
I know. My dad wrote
that one for me.

307
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,468
Again with this?

308
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:02,136
Yesterday, you had
Dakota give herself

309
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:05,039
an abdomen-punch abortion during
her volleyball tournament.

310
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:07,008
Hey, seventh grade
can be hell.

311
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:08,176
Brian, you're fired.

312
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,177
Wait, what?!

313
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:10,611
Sorry, Brian,
but you're done.

314
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,581
Oh, come on! You can't fire a
writer in the middle of a show!

315
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:15,016
That would be like
a doctor leaving

316
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,350
in the middle
of a surgery!

317
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:18,986
Help!

318
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:21,556
I'm supposed to have surgery,
but my doctor disappeared.

319
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,826
Okay, Josh, this is the shot
you've been waiting for.

320
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,397
Okay, Derek,
this is the shot

321
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,132
you've been waiting for.

322
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:34,402
Dylan, Dylan,
there you are!

323
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:36,003
Listen, you can't
let them fire me!

324
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:37,338
You're the star
of the show!

325
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:39,907
Dad, believe me, I want
you to work here with me,

326
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,676
but you can't keep
doing things like that.

327
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,144
And they know
you took those cases

328
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:44,579
of Diet Coke
home last night.

329
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:46,214
I thought they were
anybody's Diet Coke!

330
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:47,715
They're for work!
I work at home!

331
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,984
Oh, hey, by the way, are we all
getting those backpacks

332
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:51,586
with the name
of the show on them?

333
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,920
You know what, Dad?

334
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:54,635
I'm starting to think
that you've just been

335
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:56,724
using me to advance
your career!

336
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:59,026
God! You're
a terrible father!

337
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,095
I never want to
see you again!

338
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,099
My God, he's right.

339
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:08,236
I <i>am</i> a terrible father.

340
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,333
Brian, do you
know where...

341
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,335
What the hell
are you drinking?

342
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:57,270
Is that Rite Aid-
brand whiskey?

343
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,908
Stewie, I just feel so awful
about what happened with Dylan.

344
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,577
I mean, every terrible thing
he said about me is true.

345
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:06,312
Well, you're
a terrible guy, Bri.

346
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:09,449
I think being a paid writer
again just went to my head.

347
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:12,485
I mean, I just... I can't
believe I was so selfish.

348
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,054
It's-it's like Dylan just held
a mirror up to me,

349
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,391
and I could finally see how
poorly I'd been treating him.

350
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:21,361
I guess I didn't realize how
lucky I was to have Dylan back

351
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:24,597
in my life until I lost him
all over again.

352
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:25,932
Well, maybe you
should just apologize.

353
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,100
I tried to.

354
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,903
I mean, I texted him
"S-R-Y frowny face."

355
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:33,072
I mean, he knows that I'm sorry
and that I'm sad.

356
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,776
What are you guys
doing up so early?

357
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,877
What-what are we...

358
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:39,245
Where have you been?

359
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,282
Well, I certainly wasn't
at the Shriners' convention.

360
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:45,752
You know what
I think, Brian?

361
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:47,687
I think you've got to
get down to that set

362
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,856
and apologize
face-to-face.

363
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,324
You're right.

364
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,494
I just... I hope he's willing
to hear me out, you know?

365
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,396
I'm the worst father ever.

366
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,798
I'm even worse than
Marvin Gaye's dad.

367
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,400
Happy Father's Day, Dad.

368
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:03,670
Marvin, if this another
tie, I'm gonna kill you.

369
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,249
Well, looks like it's just
you and me, shadow.

370
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,186
Shadow!

371
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,493
Oh, hey, is, uh...
is Dylan back here?

372
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:29,829
Sorry, Brian, Dylan says he
doesn't want to see you anymore.

373
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,464
We're not allowed
to let you in.

374
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,299
Well, you know what?
I'm sorry, too.

375
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:35,568
For what?
For this!

376
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:39,472
Yeah, you know, you probably
would've had a better shot

377
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:40,807
if you hadn't yelled
"For this!"

378
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:42,175
You know,
that-that kind of telegraphed

379
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,509
what you were gonna do.

380
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:44,811
Ah, Stewie,
it's no use.

381
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,746
They're never
gonna let us in.

382
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,648
Well, maybe
<i>you</i> can't get in,

383
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:51,150
but I think I know
someone who can.

384
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:54,921
Zac Sawyer?

385
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,357
I'm Zac Sawyer. Say "when."

386
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,624
Acting.

387
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:02,595
Singing: pop, classical,
light opera, Italian.

388
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,065
Dancing: classical, tap, jazz.

389
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,601
Horse riding.
Can I? Yes.

390
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,436
Accents: 13.

391
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,505
South American, South African,

392
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,807
British upper class,
British Cockney.

393
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,943
"What, Govnah?"
Somebody gonna stop me?

394
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,544
Fencing, nunchucks.

395
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:21,314
Driving?
Yes. Automatic and standard...

396
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:22,715
Okay, okay. Wow.

397
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,916
You're the worst.

398
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:25,718
Welcome aboard.

399
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:33,526
We now return to <i>The</i>
<i>Love Boat with Somali Pirates.</i>

400
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,228
I am the captain now.

401
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,796
Well, okay,
but that means

402
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,532
you're in charge of getting
Mr. Devlin to admit

403
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,034
that after 30 years,

404
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,970
he still loves
Mrs. Devlin very much.

405
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,472
That is not the captain's
responsibility!

406
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,508
Well, maybe not where
<i>you</i> come from,

407
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,343
but here on
the Love Boat...

408
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,647
Now, who is Mr. Devlin?

409
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,950
Try skinny-dipping with her
like when you were kids.

410
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:59,919
Hey, Lois, if I was
gonna kill myself,

411
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:02,488
do I slit my wrists
this way or this way?

412
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,924
Sideways for attention,
long way for results!

413
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:05,925
Meg is right.

414
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,393
Okay, I'll be in
the garage.

415
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:08,861
Peter, put that knife down.

416
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,363
Lois, I don't
have any friends!

417
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,564
So I'm gonna kill myself

418
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,566
and get a full page
in the yearbook.

419
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,301
Then they <i>can't</i>
ignore me.

420
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,369
Who's that?

421
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,004
I don't know.

422
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,410
Okay, Zac, remember,
your character's name

423
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:25,578
is Tevin Ashe-Taylor.

424
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,413
You surf
and enjoy surfing.

425
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:29,549
In this scene,
DJ Slopes is thinking

426
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,050
of quitting
the detective agency,

427
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:32,552
and you're like,
"No way."

428
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:33,853
Got it.

429
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,122
We're rolling!

430
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,324
Listen, Tevin, I think
I just need more time

431
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,859
to focus
on my snowboarding

432
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,627
and Web series
about energy drinks.

433
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,863
No, man, you got to stay
in the detective agency.

434
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,299
It's what your dad
would want.

435
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,267
What?
What are you talking about?

436
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,735
What the hell's
that new kid doing?

437
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,870
This isn't in the script.

438
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,371
I'm talking about your dad, DJ.

439
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,207
He sent me here with a message.

440
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:57,210
He said he can't believe
he was so selfish.

441
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,278
It's like you held
a mirror up to him

442
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,482
and he could finally see how
poorly he'd been treating you.

443
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,784
He didn't realize how lucky
he was...

444
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,586
Stay on me,
camera one.

445
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,788
...to have you
back in his life,

446
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:12,191
and now he feels like
he's lost you all over again.

447
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:15,328
But how do I know
he won't just hurt me again?

448
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:17,463
You don't. You never know that.

449
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:21,334
But isn't taking a risk
better than not having a dad?

450
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,536
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

451
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,038
You're damn right I am.

452
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,406
Cut!

453
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,575
You know, I don't know
where any of that came from,

454
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,576
but I liked it.

455
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,677
Who are you?

456
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:33,279
I'm Zac Sawyer.

457
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,081
And I go where I'm needed.

458
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:39,852
♪ Here I go again on my own

459
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:44,190
♪ Going down the only road
I've ever known. ♪

460
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,758
Where you headed?

461
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,193
Wherever I'm needed.

462
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,961
No, no, it does
not work like that.

463
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:50,696
I need to put
address in machine.

464
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:53,132
Okay, maybe, you can
just take me home then.

465
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,133
Where is home?

466
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,568
I-I don't know.

467
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,270
It's-it's my mom
and dad's house,

468
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,871
but I don't
know the address!

469
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,072
I take you airport.

470
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:00,607
Okay!

471
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,647
All right, Quagmire, I have
given this a lot of thought.

472
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,782
I need you to shoot me
in the arm

473
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,217
so we can be friends again.

474
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,952
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

475
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,387
No, no, I was supposed
to offer,

476
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,389
and then you were supposed
to say, "No, Peter,

477
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:17,590
"I'm not gonna shoot you,

478
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,058
although I do appreciate
the gesture."

479
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,626
Hand me the gun, Peter.

480
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,129
I, uh... I passed the test?

481
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,898
No, Peter. I'm gonna shoot you
like a dirty animal.

482
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,099
But-but just the fact

483
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:29,335
that I would make the offer
is so meaningful to you.

484
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,469
Your offer means
nothing, Peter.

485
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,871
The only thing that
means anything to me

486
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,606
is a bullet in your arm.
Now give me that!

487
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,941
Stop! Stop!
Quagmire, let go!

488
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,309
Come on! You're not leaving
here without being shot!

489
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,677
Look, I was trying
to do the decent thing,

490
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:38,945
like you'd see in a movie!

491
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,179
I'm putting that bullet
in your arm, Peter!

492
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:41,914
Ah! Son of a bitch!

493
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:44,083
It's over.
We're all friends again.

494
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:45,318
What the hell, Joe?!

495
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,819
I'm just trying
to settle this nonsense.

496
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,087
Nothing got settled!
You shot him!

497
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,755
I'm the one who
has to shoot him!

498
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,325
Wait a second. All right, then
I get to shoot Joe, all right?

499
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,562
He shot me! I mean, if we're
doing things fair here, then...

500
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:58,764
All right, we're good.

501
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:04,770
Hey, Dad.

502
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:05,771
Dylan?

503
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,106
I went to your house,

504
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,808
and Chris told me
you'd be here.

505
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:11,544
Look, Dylan, I-I'm really sorry
I hurt you.

506
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:15,047
I've been a really bad father,
like Ernest Hemmingway

507
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:16,349
or-or some other great writer.

508
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,117
But if-if you'll give me
a chance,

509
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,147
I-I'd like
to try to change that.

510
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:22,049
I'd like that, too, Dad.

511
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:37,798
Peter, I'm so glad you patched
things up with your friends.

512
00:20:37,832 --> 00:20:40,775
Have I told you
that we're all friends again?

513
00:20:40,776 --> 00:20:43,365
Yes, Peter, we were just
talking about it.

514
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:47,129
They're gonna take me
to the zoo and roll me around.

515
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:50,346
We're all friends again.
