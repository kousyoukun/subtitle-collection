00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:04,470
 it seems today
that all you see 

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:07,773
 is violence in movies
and sex on tv 

3
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:11,343
 but where are those
good old-fashioned values 

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,346
 on which we used to rely? 

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,850
 lucky there's a family guy 

6
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:21,153
 lucky there's a man
who positively can do 

7
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,721
 all the things that make us 

8
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,123
 laugh and cry 

9
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:30,729
 he's... A...
Fam... Ily... Guy!

00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:43,976
Hello. Come, let's see some
beautiful sites together.

15
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,478
Hello, tree.
Thank you for shade.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,980
Hello, mountain cat.

17
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:50,649
Thank you for controlling
local rat population.

18
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,017
Hello, windmill.

19
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,686
Thank you for the cheese ride
and ball cooling.

20
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,855
Next week, bullet trains.

21
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,491
Hello...!

22
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,760
Hey, dad. Are you busy?

23
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,530
I was thinking we could
spend some time together.

24
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,165
Okay, are you a
television set,

25
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,232
Or the internet?

26
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,233
No.

27
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,601
Oh, then no.
No, thank you.

28
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:10,869
Are you sure?

29
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,738
Cause there's a
three-day weekend coming up

30
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,007
And I thought maybe you and I
can finally go fishing

31
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,508
Like we've been
talking about.

32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,778
Aw, sorry, chris, I can't.
I got insanity practice.

33
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,046
(yelling hysterically)

34
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:23,549
Pinwheels! Pinwheels in my head!

35
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,217
Voices! Angry fish!

36
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,885
How's he doing?
Not good.

37
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,588
He still thinks this is
"practice" of some sort.

38
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,591
But you promised
we'd go fishing.

39
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,761
Aw, chris, I was just
lying to you so you'd go away.

40
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,964
But, if you leave me alone now,
I'll give you a billion dollars.

41
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,100
You've got a deal!

42
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,568
Peter, you know,
I-it might help chris

43
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,570
To be able to spend
some time with his father.

44
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:45,938
Well, what's in it
for ol' pete?

45
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,106
He's your son.

46
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,740
Don't you want someone
to bond with.

47
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,477
No. I only form
unspoken bonds.

48
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,878
(tires screech)

49
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,751
Pat benatar (on radio):
 hit me with your best shot 

50
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,386
 why don't you hit me
with your best shot? 

51
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:02,721
(increases volume)

52
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,889
 

53
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,757
 hit me with your best shot 

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,059
(increases volume)

55
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,595
 fire away... 

56
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,797
(increases volume)

57
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,465
 you come on
with a "come on"... 

58
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,237
O-okay.

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,239
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

60
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,573
You guys, that was my mom.

61
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,275
She said that
daddy broke his leg.

62
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,309
How?!

63
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,945
A-apparently, he got hurt
at the mall.

64
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,448
Carter, please stop
doing that.

65
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,316
We need to get you
some new corduroys.

66
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,919
No! None of the other boys
are wearing corduroys!

67
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,187
I want dungarees!

68
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,089
You're going to
get hurt doing that.

69
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,259
No I'm not!
I'm the<i> champ</i> at doing this!

70
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,960
Ow! You jinxed me!

71
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:42,995
Aw, damn it!

72
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,329
Hey, call that beeping cart

73
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,532
That carries around
the fat black people.

74
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,967
Well, I guess babs has
her work cut out for her.

75
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,703
Actually, mom can't take care
of him, she's out of town

76
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:55,207
Doing a photo shoot for the
cover of<i> veins magazine.</i>

77
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,811
So, are you gonna go
take care of him, mom?

78
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:03,048
I can't go. I've got to go get
my hair very minutely changed

79
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,385
And then spend the next 14 hours
trying to get people to notice.

80
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,788
Well...?

81
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,623
Lois, move.
You're blocking the tv.

82
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,792
(laughs)
what do you think?

83
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,394
I think you're
blocking the tv.

84
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,163
Peter, I-is there anything
you want to say to me?

85
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,331
(sighs)

86
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,700
All right.
Amy at work kissed me.

87
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,635
It<i> is</i> true
that I did not step away,

88
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,003
But I did not lean in.

89
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,471
However, in my defense,

90
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,141
She had recently gotten
her hair done differently.

91
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,810
I was actually thinking that
maybe<i> you</i> could go help daddy.

92
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,212
Well, not me, mom.

93
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:34,646
Last time I was
at grandpa's,

94
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,182
I beat him at checkers and he
punched one of my hogans.

95
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,483
Well, what about chris?

96
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,152
Wai-wait, where is chris?

97
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,520
He's upstairs
in his room.

98
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,488
That's odd.
He never misses a meal.

99
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,823
I-I better go check on him.

100
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,024
Yeah, good idea.

101
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,894
I better check on my
hairless twin in the storm shed.

102
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,398
Close the door,
the moonlight burns!

103
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,867
It's almost christmas.
It's almost christmas.

104
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,169
Christmas?!

105
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,570
Yes. Keep being good

106
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,607
And all the eggshells and
coffee grounds will be yours.

107
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,675
Can I meet the family?

108
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,510
You've overstepped!
No christmas!

109
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,778
(door slams shut)

110
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,083
Hey, chris. Are you okay?

111
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,518
Holy crap, it smells
like farts in here.

112
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,254
Those are<i> my</i> farts.

113
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,923
Why doesn't dad ever
want to spend time with me?

114
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,458
Chris, come here.

115
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,526
Sit down.

116
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,595
You know I love you,
right, sweetie?

117
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,964
Mom... Not in front
of my posters.

118
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,899
And your father
loves you, too.

119
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,802
He just has trouble
expressing his emotions.

120
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,704
Peter:
I love<i> mike & molly!</i>

121
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,307
I love mike
and I also love molly!

122
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,476
And I don't care
who knows it!

123
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,778
You know, chris,
you've got a grandpa

124
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,480
Who could use
your help right now.

125
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,116
I'm sure he'd enjoy
spending time with you.

126
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,318
Okay... I'll give
it a shot.

127
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,422
You're not gonna
kill yourself, are you?

128
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,158
That would be a severe black
mark on my record as a mom.

129
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,428
Oh, I'd have to make up stories
of a severe mental illness.

130
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,231
Make is seem a<i> miracle</i>
you made it this long.

131
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,633
I could do that.

132
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,139
Sucks about your leg, grandpa.

133
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,573
How you been doin'?

134
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,442
Well, let me tell you,
this is awful.

135
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,810
I-I'm so bored.

136
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,945
I can't sleep,
I-I just have to lie here

137
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,781
And wait for my
stupid leg to heal.

138
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,649
Oh, I'm really
sorry, grandpa.

139
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,951
And the worst part about it,
is I can't have sex.

140
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,788
God! I wish there was a way
I could just do it myself.

141
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,757
You know, just-just to be done
and napping within four minutes.

142
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,994
Let me show you something.

143
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:32,931
That... Was... Amazing!

144
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,000
And lynda carter
wasn't actually here?

145
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,002
No! That was just
in your mind.

146
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,170
Incredible!

147
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,304
So-so you can do that like,

148
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,839
Wh-what, once a year
or something?

149
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,441
No. You can do it basically

150
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,209
Whenever you're not
doing something else.

151
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,444
Cool!

152
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,679
Hey, next time I want to
try it with<i> my</i> hand.

153
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,217
Hey, grandpa.
What should we do now?

154
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,618
You wanna order a pizza?

155
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,153
Well, that doesn't sound
very exciting.

156
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,357
But now you can
follow your order<i> online!</i>

157
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,491
(keyboard clicking)

158
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,659
There it is.
It's on van buren!

159
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:01,860
Oh. Oh. He's almost here!

160
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,830
Wow, he's really fast.
Hey, I got an idea,

161
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,165
Let's put in<i> two</i> different
orders and have 'em race!

162
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,368
(gasps)
you think it'll
crash the system?

163
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,303
Only one way to find out.
(keyboard clicking)

164
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,406
Here's your pizza.
That's $16.50.

165
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,074
We were playing
a game with you.

166
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,876
That's what you are.
You're a clown.

167
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,378
Are you gonna
pay for the pizza?

168
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,847
Yes. Your money is in
this pile of mashed potatoes.

169
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,649
Eat your way out. No hands.

170
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,418
(munching, moaning)

171
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,221
This is fun, chris.
I like hanging out with you.

172
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,256
Don't look up.
You're not a part of this.

173
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,991
 

174
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,429
It's sounding really
good, grandpa.

175
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,730
I know, I know.

176
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,931
Sorry I'm late.

177
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,767
Look, jason, are you
taking this seriously?

178
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,535
Because chris and I
take this seriously.

179
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,704
You know, if you're not
gonna show up to rehearsal,

180
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,539
We'll find someone else
who will, all right?

181
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,342
We want to get
some paying gigs!
Sorry. Geez.

182
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,779
Remember, this is about
writing music that means
something to us!

183
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,681
Okay, from the top.

184
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,683
 halls mentho-lyptus 

185
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,886
 you can feel it
in your nose 

186
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,722
 that's how you know
it's a medicated cough drop 

187
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,857
 and not just a candy. 

188
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,959
Hey, can we play
one of my songs?

189
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,962
No! No one wants to hear
your stupid songs about nothing!

190
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:15,100
Now, let's play
"I fell in the shower,
so maybe we do need that bar."

191
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,835
Five, six,
seven, eight!

192
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,873
Listen, chris, I really
want to thank you

193
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,709
For coming to take care of me
and helping me get well again.

194
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,978
Oh, it was no big deal.
Well, it is to me,

195
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,448
And I want to give you some
money for all your time.

196
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,249
Come on, y-you don't
have to do that.

197
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,286
I just like getting
to spend time with
my grandpa, you know?

198
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,588
I... Wait, wait, what?

199
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,623
You're... You're not
gonna take the money?

200
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,492
No, I don't want
your money.

201
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,461
I had fun
hanging out with you.

202
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,329
Well, all right, then.

203
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,131
Hey, grandpa,
check it out.

204
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,833
When I make
my elbow like this,

205
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,001
It looks like
women's private parts!

206
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,004
(laughs): Oh, chris!
You just have a way
of looking at things

207
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,140
That's delightfully fresh!

208
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,578
(both laughing)

209
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,413
We're not supposed
to be doing this.

210
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,715
I bet we're not supposed
to be doing this.

211
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,952
Daddy!
You're all better!

212
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,754
That's right, pumpkin.
And I have an important
announcement to make.

213
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,290
I have decided
to change my will,

214
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,292
And name
my grandson chris

215
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,828
The sole heir
to the pewterschmidt fortune.

216
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,296
You what?
What?
Oh, my!

217
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,698
(clattering in distance)

218
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,901
Oh, no!
My hairless twin got out!

219
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,837
(gunshot)

220
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,273
Hello, family.

221
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,276
Let's eat all
the garbage we want.

222
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,519
Daddy, you're seriously leaving
your entire estate to chris?

223
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,521
I-I mean,
what about mom?

224
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,290
I promise she'll be dead
before I am. I promise.

225
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,392
But, grandpa, I don't
even want the money.

226
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,861
See? This is exactly
why you should get it!

227
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,029
So refreshing!

228
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,731
Well, I-I don't
want it, either.

229
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,299
Good, 'cause
you're not getting it.

230
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,800
Come on, what
are you doing?

231
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,003
Listen, carter, you take
me out of your will,

232
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,071
I'm taking you
out of mine.

233
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:03,141
Peter, that wasn't your will,
that was your birth certificate.

234
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,309
Oh, no!

235
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,477
(gasps)

236
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,745
There's no light!

237
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,580
There's only fire!

238
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,349
Look, carter, I suppose
you're entitled to do
what you want,

239
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,852
But, you know, I'm just
saying, if it were me,

240
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,921
I would give all the
money to charity.

241
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,088
Oh, yeah?
Which charity?

242
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,823
Well, there are
just so many

243
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,358
That do such
great work.

244
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,593
Name just one.

245
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,361
Um... Well,
you know...

246
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,031
Poor... Green...

247
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,732
Whale... Guns...

248
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,034
Books?

249
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,102
You are
such a fraud.

250
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,439
Why won't anyone help us?!

251
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,912
What the hell?
I can't believe your dad's

252
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,447
Giving all his cash
to chris!

253
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,083
I know it's strange,
but in the end
it's his money,

254
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,718
So who really cares?

255
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,386
Well, yeah, but...

256
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,955
But what?

257
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,924
Peter... Did you marry
me for my money?

258
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,260
Of course not, lois,
but even you can't deny

259
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,462
It was always gonna
be a huge perk.

260
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,632
D-did I use that
right? Perk?
Yes, peter.

261
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,868
Yeah, I thought so,
but then it just sounded
kind of weird when I said it.

262
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,270
It was fine.
Thanks.

263
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,039
Anyway, I don't
plan on losing out
on any of that money.

264
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,276
So if you ask me, we
got to start sucking up
to chris right away.

265
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,278
What? Wh-what are
you talking about?

266
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,113
I'm talking about
brownnosing chris

267
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,082
And getting on
his good side perk.

268
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,883
No, that's wrong.
No "perk."

269
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,920
Okay, my bad.
But I've been counting
on that money, lois.

270
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,255
It's always been critical
to my master plan.

271
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,757
What master plan?

272
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,926
Look, I never
told you this, but...

273
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,329
For years now, I've been
planning on retiring at 45

274
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,833
So I can work on
finding a cure for
ballzheimers disease.

275
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,302
Peter, are
those testicles?

276
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,937
Wh-where did
you get those?

277
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,473
(crying):
I don't remember!

278
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,445
Hey, hey, there he is!

279
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,315
Oh, boy, hot dogs and
nintendo, huh, chris?

280
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,517
Dad, what are you doing?
What's going on?

281
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,685
(laughs)

282
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:54,853
Good one, chris!

283
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,021
(laughing)

284
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,756
Good one!
Why are you dressed
like that?

285
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,424
I don't know. I-I
just kind of felt

286
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,859
Like this is what
cool people wear.

287
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,528
Hey, hey, chris, how about you
and me do a secret handshake

288
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,630
That has way too many steps
to remember, all right?

289
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,366
Okay. Shake, bump, bump,
slap, pinky hook,

290
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,036
Pretend to slick your hair back,
represent, bump,

291
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,104
One spin, slap high, slap low,

292
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,540
Reverse spin, bump, explode,
shake, belly rub,

293
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,109
Fake yawn, finger gun,
hitchhiker, hitchhiker,

294
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,278
Shimmy shimmy sham sham,
shake, shake, shake, bump,

295
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,846
Something smells
and shake again.

296
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,282
Okay, ready?

297
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,285
Oh, my god, it's nighttime.

298
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,124
Man (on tv):
We now return to the director's
cut of<i> mission: Impossible 5,</i>

299
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,694
With the step stools
not edited out.

300
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,196
You're coming with me because
I'm definitely over six feet,

301
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,731
And you're not handsome.

302
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,399
Hey, chris, hey,
you remember that kid

303
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,068
You said was bullying
you at school?

304
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,369
Well, here's his head!

305
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,503
(screaming)

306
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,671
That's not even him!

307
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,206
That's the deaf kid!

308
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,175
Oh, that was
sign language.

309
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,210
I thought he was
trying to defend himself

310
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,112
With terrible karate.

311
00:11:56,148 --> 00:12:00,151
Chris, I want to share with you
a timeworn father/son tradition.

312
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,087
I am gonna show you
a film comedy

313
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,322
From my youth
that won't hold up.

314
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,858
Welcome to the classic comedy,
<i>meatballs.</i>

315
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,259
Oh, that sounds great.

316
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,261
Is it about a pasta
factory or something?

317
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,696
No, that's part of the joke.

318
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,031
Who's the guy?

319
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,999
That's not a guy.
That's the hot chick!

320
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,334
Where are her boobs?

321
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,203
Flat with a decent face
was the best

322
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,404
We could hope for back then.

323
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,773
Miley cyrus had sex
with a foam finger

324
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,842
At, like, 6:00 p.M.
Central time.

325
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,010
This movie has a canoe
that slowly sinks.

326
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,846
All right, you know what?
Forget it!

327
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,715
I'm just gonna take my vcr,
my vcr head-cleaning tape,

328
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,618
My vcr head-cleaning spray,
my head-cleaning rag,

329
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,621
And my rewinder, and just
get the hell out of here.

330
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,061
Man (on tv):
<i>We now return to</i> at the movies

331
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,697
With two guys who watch
the films on their iphones.

332
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,132
Good evening.
First off, we're going

333
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,867
To review paul greengrass'
<i>captain phillips.</i>

334
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,468
What did you think, bill?

335
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,070
Well, it got off
to a great start,

336
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,372
But when it was my turn
to play<i> words with friends,</i>

337
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,707
It really took
me out of it.

338
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,275
Well, that's a shame,
because visually...

339
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,611
(phone whooshes)
ooh!

340
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,314
Announcer:
<i>When we come back, the guys</i>
<i>will review</i> american hustle.

341
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,816
Hmm?

342
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,551
Hey, you guys.

343
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,052
Geez, peter,
you look exhausted.

344
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,155
Ugh, I am. I've
been busting my ass

345
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,624
For the last week trying
to suck up to chris.

346
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,159
To chris?
What the hell for?

347
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,460
Well, carter
kind of decided

348
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,328
He's gonna leave all
his money to chris.

349
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,464
So, I've been trying to
get on his good side.

350
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,599
I even cleaned his room
for him the other day.

351
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,168
Wish I hadn't done that.

352
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,504
Chris, our
bath is ready.

353
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,406
I... Uh...

354
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,475
I don't... I don't know
what to do now.

355
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,677
I... I don't have
the parenting skills necessary

356
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,912
To deal with this.

357
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,814
I say we never
speak of this again.

358
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,116
I... I might move.

359
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,084
You know what?
I say, good for chris

360
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,453
And whatever lucky girl
he ends up marrying.

361
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,923
Yeah, or lucky guy,
if he ends up being gay.

362
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,457
Lucky guy?

363
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,026
Wait a minute.

364
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,195
You guys just gave me an idea!

365
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,529
(playing tuba)

366
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,964
(laughs)

367
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,133
What's he doing up there?
He's a cat!

368
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,169
He can't play no tuba!

369
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,504
No, wait!

370
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,873
Actually, you guys
gave me two ideas!

371
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,274
(snoring)

372
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:07,512
Mumbling while I sleep
to indicate dream content.

373
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,847
Chris, chris, wake up.

374
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,949
I have something very
important to ask you.

375
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:14,152
Chris, there comes a time when
every man looks at his son

376
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:18,256
And thinks, "I want to take
this to the next level."

377
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,828
Chris griffin...
Will you marry me?

378
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,198
What?! Is it even legal
for a man to marry his son?

379
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,633
It is in vermont.

380
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,835
As long as it's a man and a
man, anything goes up there.

381
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,637
They're a bunch of
liberal degenerates.

382
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,539
I don't know.
It seems really weird.

383
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,908
I mean, aren't men
supposed to marry women?

384
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,477
No, no, no, that's just
all of human history

385
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,079
Except for the
last five months.

386
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,647
We'll just be
like best pals.

387
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,315
And besides, there's
plenty of people

388
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,917
Who are married
and don't have sex.

389
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,652
Like will smith
and that pit bull.

390
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,487
Why do you even
want to marry me?

391
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,856
It's time to settle down
and simplify things,

392
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,692
Like maybe having one atm
card and one bank account.

393
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,160
Say, yours.

394
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:59,097
Oh. I get it.

395
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,832
So, what do you say?

396
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,103
When you're married, you get
to spend all your time together,

397
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,939
Doing things like playing catch
and going fishing, right?

398
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,841
Well, the best marriages
give each other space,

399
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,109
But, yes, chris.

400
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,778
Then, yes, I will
marry you, dad!

401
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,247
Oh, that's
wonderful news!

402
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,616
You should know this
ring is very special.

403
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,551
It used to belong
to your mother.

404
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,553
Wait. What<i> about</i> mom?

405
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,422
I'm afraid that's
over, chris.

406
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,757
Lois, wake up.

407
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,725
I need you to sign
this legal document.

408
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,727
Huh? Wha-what is this?

409
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,863
It's a petition
to force that hot mom

410
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,898
To wear something appropriate
at pta meetings.

411
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, thank god.

412
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,205
(cans rattling, tires squeaking)

413
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,308
(engine revving)

414
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,212
No, dad.

415
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,682
I don't know
what normal is anymore.

416
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,128
So now you know my complete
sexual history, chris.

417
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,932
Wow. I'm surprised you got
fooled by a bear in a wig.

418
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,968
It wasn't a wig,
it was a hair system.

419
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,436
Well, whatever.

420
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,304
Why do we have
all these appointments?

421
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,239
Wedding dj, florist.

422
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:18,009
Because, chris, it takes time
to plan a perfect wedding.

423
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,677
You don't want
to jump the gun.

424
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,146
You know, like when you
respond to a text too quickly.

425
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,550
(whooshing)

426
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,854
(whooshing)

427
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,129
So, should we get started
with your bridal registry?

428
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,031
Yeah, um, I'd like
to furnish my kitchen

429
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,266
As if I'm the greatest
chef in the world,

430
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,701
Even though I've
never cooked before.

431
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,169
That's what we do!
Okay, great.

432
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,005
All right, we'll start
with the nine grand

433
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,407
In copper-bottom
cookware.

434
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,180
Holy wack-a-zoly!

435
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,482
Dad!
What?

436
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,817
Don't "what" me.
You know what you did.

437
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,121
Hey, I may be your husband and
your dad, but I'm still a man.

438
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,793
Yeah, we're looking to plan our
post-wedding Sunday breakfast.

439
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,495
You know,
when everyone's sick of us.

440
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,696
Of course.

441
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,831
Excellent. Do you have
a table for the couple

442
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,167
That barely made it through
the weekend without breaking up?

443
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,969
Absolutely. Can I put
them near the couple

444
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,071
That hooked up drunk and now
have to make awkward small talk

445
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,839
Until their cab to
the airport arrives?

446
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,074
Sure. And maybe
they could go next

447
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,575
To the vastly-underdressed
cousin

448
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,544
Who thinks
the world revolves around him?

449
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,979
I have just the spot.

450
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,247
Will there be a
physically-frail,

451
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,415
Fall-down uncle?

452
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,316
Indeed. And we'd like
to have him walk

453
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,684
Through a maze
of chair legs.

454
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,053
Anything else?
Yes.

455
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,487
We did invite
a black couple.

456
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,756
Um, even though we only met them
three months ago,

457
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,825
But we would like them
to be prominently featured

458
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,795
To let the other guests know how
tolerant and wonderful we are.

459
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,700
I'm excited for
your first dance.

460
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,402
And now we're
ready to add music.

461
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,570
What's your song?

462
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,505
You know, I've given it
a lot of thought,

463
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,674
And I went with the most
romantic song ever,

464
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,111
"stars and stripes forever"
by john philip sousa.

465
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,345
 

466
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,547
March! March!
March! March!

467
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,348
Can you feel the
soldiers, chris?

468
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,750
So many have fallen.

469
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,385
And this is why
they were fighting.

470
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,253
For a man to marry his son

471
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,721
In a state with
enough trees around

472
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,824
That nobody can
see what's going on.

473
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,961
(organ plays gentle melody)

474
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,065
It was nice of the
guests at the cat funeral

475
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,467
To stay for our wedding.

476
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,202
Yeah, and I bet
you're especially happy

477
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,870
We're getting married
on a Thursday.

478
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,738
School, yuck, right?!

479
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,874
Welcome, friends, loved ones,

480
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,543
And people who are waiting
for the 3:00 check-in time

481
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,911
With nothing better to do.

482
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,546
Just let us put
our bags in there.

483
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,882
I'm literally gonna
grab my shorts and leave.

484
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:41,886
I understand the two of you
have written your own vows?

485
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,654
Chris, to express my love,

486
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,791
I turn to the words of the only
poet that blue collar,

487
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,428
New England scumbags
like me know: Robert frost.

488
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,297
"two roads diverged
in a wood, and I...

489
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,933
I took the one less traveled."

490
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,436
Now, I ain't no scholar,
but if that's not a metaphor

491
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,805
For major-league butt stuff,
I don't know what is.

492
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,573
Thank you. Chris?

493
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,375
Lois:
Stop the wedding!

494
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,945
Lois! How did you
find out about this?

495
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,747
Peter, several people
have called the police

496
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,115
About a man marrying his son.

497
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,650
It's not normal!

498
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,086
Peter? Peter
griffin?

499
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,021
Oh, god.

500
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,756
Is everyone
from your past here

501
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,491
To walk you down
the aisle?!

502
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,959
Peter, you
cannot do this!

503
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,828
You cannot
marry your son!

504
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,963
I don't care how much
money daddy's left him.

505
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,431
Don't listen
to your mother, chris.

506
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,100
It's 'cause of her
we have bedtimes!

507
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,002
Chris, come on,
we're going home!

508
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,870
He can't make
you do this.

509
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,839
But, mom,
I<i> want</i> to do this.

510
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,207
What?

511
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,810
I know he's marrying me
for my money, but I don't care.

512
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,647
Dad and I spent more time
together planning this wedding

513
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,215
Than we ever have before.

514
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,783
And if being married means

515
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,887
I get to spend even more time
with my dad, then it's worth it.

516
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:54,292
Wait. You knew all along I
just wanted you for your money?

517
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,661
Yeah, dad, I did.

518
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,996
Wow.

519
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,399
Oh, boy, I've
been a real jerk.

520
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,867
I'm sorry, chris.

521
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,502
But you know what?

522
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,038
I'm gonna make it up to
you, starting right now.

523
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,308
Chris griffin...
Will you be my son?

524
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,476
Yes, dad.

525
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:16,814
Omg, the photographer is,
like, obsessed with me.

526
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,383
Well, let's all go home,
you guys.

527
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,586
I think we've had enough
excitement for one day.

528
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,554
Yeah, and
I guess I learned

529
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,389
It's wrong to take
your son to vermont

530
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,724
Under false
pretenses

531
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,726
To try to marry him
for his inheritance.

532
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,927
You... You should've
known that.

533
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,862
Well, we should
probably get going.

534
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,232
I think this
adventure is over.

535
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,201
Peter:
<i>Interestingly, however,</i>
<i>I did run into chris again.</i>

536
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,337
<i>It was on the upper west</i>
<i>side of manhattan.</i>

537
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,272
<i>He was with another dad.</i>
<i>I was with another son.</i>

538
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:44,508
<i>But it was nice reminiscing</i>
<i>about old times.</i>

539
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,776
<i>For you kids watching,</i>

540
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,044
<i>This is a reference</i>
<i>to a woody allen movie.</i>

541
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,146
<i>He also married one</i>
<i>of his children.</i>
