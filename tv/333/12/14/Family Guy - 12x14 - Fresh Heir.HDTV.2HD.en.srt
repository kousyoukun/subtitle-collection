Hello. Come, let's see some
beautiful sites together.

16
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:46,046
Hello, Tree.
Thank you for shade.

Next week, bullet trains.

22
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:59,026
Hello...!

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,161
Hey, Dad. Are you busy?

24
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,031
I was thinking we could
spend some time together.

25
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,699
Okay, are you a
television set,

26
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,733
or the Internet?

27
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:07,668
No.

28
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,102
Oh, then no.
No, thank you.

29
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:10,370
Are you sure?

30
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,172
Cause there's a
three-day weekend coming up

31
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,508
and I thought maybe you and I
can finally go fishing

32
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,009
like we've been
talking about.

33
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:19,346
Aw, sorry, Chris, I can't.
I got insanity practice.

34
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:23,050
Pinwheels! Pinwheels in my head!

35
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,751
Voices! Angry fish!

36
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:26,453
How's he doing?
Not good.

37
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,156
He still thinks this is
"practice" of some sort.

38
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,125
But you promised
we'd go fishing.

39
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,295
Aw, Chris, I was just
lying to you so you'd go away.

40
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,498
But, if you leave me alone now,
I'll give you a billion dollars.

41
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,601
You've got a deal!

42
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:42,035
Peter, you know,
i-it might help Chris

43
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,871
to be able to spend
some time with his father.

44
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:45,439
Well, what's in it
for ol' Pete?

45
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:46,607
He's your son.

46
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:48,208
Don't you want someone
to bond with.

47
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,978
No. I only form
unspoken bonds.

O-Okay.

00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,640
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

55
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:20,874
You guys, that was my mom.

56
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,676
She said that
Daddy broke his leg.

57
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,777
How?!

58
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,380
A-Apparently, he got hurt
at the mall.

59
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:28,849
Carter, please stop
doing that.

60
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,784
We need to get you
some new corduroys.

61
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,320
No! None of the other boys
are wearing corduroys!

62
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,655
I want dungarees!

63
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,523
You're going to
get hurt doing that.

64
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,493
No I'm not!
I'm the <i>champ</i> at doing this!

65
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,395
Ow! You jinxed me!

66
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:42,429
Aw, damn it!

67
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,764
Hey, call that beeping cart

68
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,966
that carries around
the fat black people.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,268
Well, I guess Babs has
her work cut out for her.

70
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,138
Actually, Mom can't take care
of him, she's out of town

71
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:54,574
doing a photo shoot for the
cover of <i>Veins Magazine.</i>

72
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:59,246
So, are you gonna go
take care of him, Mom?

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,282
I can't go. I've got to go get
my hair very minutely changed

74
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:05,686
and then spend the next 14 hours
trying to get people to notice.

75
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,122
Well...?

76
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:11,024
Lois, move.
You're blocking the TV.

77
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:13,160
What do you think?

78
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,795
I think you're
blocking the TV.

79
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:17,531
Peter, i-is there anything
you want to say to me?

80
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,867
All right.
Amy at work kissed me.

81
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:23,036
It <i>is</i> true
that I did not step away,

82
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,337
but I did not lean in.

83
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,839
However, in my defense,

84
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,308
she had recently gotten
her hair done differently.

85
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,211
I was actually thinking that
maybe <i>you</i> could go help Daddy.

86
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,579
Well, not me, Mom.

87
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,980
Last time I was
at Grandpa's,

88
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:36,516
I beat him at checkers and he
punched one of my hogans.

89
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,651
Well, what about Chris?

90
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,519
Wai-Wait, where is Chris?

91
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:40,887
He's upstairs
in his room.

92
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:42,689
That's odd.
He never misses a meal.

93
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,224
I-I better go check on him.

94
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,425
Yeah, good idea.

95
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,095
I better check on my
hairless twin in the storm shed.

96
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:52,799
Close the door,
the moonlight burns!

97
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:55,202
It's almost Christmas.
It's almost Christmas.

98
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,536
Christmas?!

99
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,938
Yes. Keep being good

100
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,941
and all the eggshells and
coffee grounds will be yours.

101
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,776
Can I meet the family?

102
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,778
You've overstepped!
No Christmas!

103
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,383
Hey, Chris. Are you okay?

104
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:12,819
Holy crap, it smells
like farts in here.

105
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,554
Those are <i>my</i> farts.

106
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:17,224
Why doesn't Dad ever
want to spend time with me?

107
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,725
Chris, come here.

108
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:20,794
Sit down.

109
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,829
You know I love you,
right, sweetie?

110
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:25,265
Mom... not in front
of my posters.

111
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:27,234
And your father
loves you, too.

112
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,103
He just has trouble
expressing his emotions.

113
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:32,038
I love <i>Mike & Molly!</i>

114
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:34,608
I love Mike
and I also love Molly!

115
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,810
And I don't care
who knows it!

116
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:39,112
You know, Chris,
you've got a grandpa

117
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:40,781
who could use
your help right now.

118
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:43,450
I'm sure he'd enjoy
spending time with you.

119
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,585
Okay... I'll give
it a shot.

120
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,750
You're not gonna
kill yourself, are you?

121
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,259
That would be a severe black
mark on my record as a mom.

122
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:55,762
Oh, I'd have to make up stories
of a severe mental illness.

123
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:58,465
Make is seem a <i>miracle</i>
you made it this long.

124
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,801
I could do that.

125
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,406
Sucks about your leg, Grandpa.

126
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,841
How you been doin'?

127
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,676
Well, let me tell you,
this is awful.

128
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,977
I-I'm so bored.

129
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:13,180
I can't sleep,
I-I just have to lie here

130
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:15,048
and wait for my
stupid leg to heal.

131
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,950
Oh, I'm really
sorry, Grandpa.

132
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,219
And the worst part about it,
is I can't have sex.

133
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:22,055
God! I wish there was a way
I could just do it myself.

134
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,991
You know, just-just to be done
and napping within four minutes.

135
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:28,228
Let me show you something.

136
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,932
That... was... amazing!

137
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,234
And Lynda Carter
wasn't actually here?

138
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,236
No! That was just
in your mind.

139
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,404
Incredible!

140
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,538
So-So you can do that like,

141
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:40,073
wh-what, once a year
or something?

142
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,641
No. You can do it basically

143
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,310
whenever you're not
doing something else.

144
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,644
Cool!

145
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,847
Hey, next time I want to
try it with <i>my</i> hand.

146
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,484
Hey, Grandpa.
What should we do now?

147
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,886
You wanna order a pizza?

148
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,354
Well, that doesn't sound
very exciting.

149
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:57,557
But now you can
follow your order <i>online!</i>

150
00:05:58,793 --> 00:05:59,659
There it is.
It's on Van Buren!

151
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:00,994
Oh. Oh. He's almost here!

152
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,964
Wow, he's really fast.
Hey, I got an idea,

153
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,299
let's put in <i>two</i> different
orders and have 'em race!

154
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,535
You think it'll
crash the system?

155
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,437
Only one way to find out.

156
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,607
Here's your pizza.
That's $16.50.

157
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,242
We were playing
a game with you.

158
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,077
That's what you are.
You're a clown.

159
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,545
Are you gonna
pay for the pizza?

160
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,014
Yes. Your money is in
this pile of mashed potatoes.

161
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,783
Eat your way out. No hands.

162
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:28,421
This is fun, Chris.
I like hanging out with you.

163
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,290
Don't look up.
You're not a part of this.

164
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,429
It's sounding really
good, Grandpa.

165
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:37,898
I know, I know.

166
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:38,932
Sorry I'm late.

167
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,901
Look, Jason, are you
taking this seriously?

168
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,669
Because Chris and I
take this seriously.

169
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,905
You know, if you're not
gonna show up to rehearsal,

170
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,740
we'll find someone else
who will, all right?

171
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,376
We want to get some paying gigs!
Sorry. Geez.

172
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,946
Remember, this is about writing music
that means something to us!

173
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,882
Okay, from the top.

174
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,817
♪ Halls Mentho-lyptus

175
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:00,086
♪ You can feel it
in your nose ♪

176
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:02,856
♪ That's how you know
it's a medicated cough drop ♪

177
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,791
♪ And not just a candy.

178
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,093
Hey, can we play
one of my songs?

179
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:10,096
No! No one wants to hear
your stupid songs about nothing!

180
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:14,200
Now, let's play "I Fell in the Shower,
So Maybe We Do Need That Bar."

181
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:15,902
Five, six,
seven, eight!

182
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:20,974
Listen, Chris, I really
want to thank you

183
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,843
for coming to take care of me
and helping me get well again.

184
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:26,112
Oh, it was no big deal.
Well, it is to me,

185
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:28,581
and I want to give you some
money for all your time.

186
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,283
Come on, y-you don't
have to do that.

187
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:33,420
I just like getting to spend time
with my grandpa, you know?

188
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,689
I... Wait, wait, what?

189
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,691
You're... you're not
gonna take the money?

190
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,592
No, I don't want
your money.

191
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,528
I had fun
hanging out with you.

192
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,430
Well, all right, then.

193
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,231
Hey, Grandpa,
check it out.

194
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,833
When I make
my elbow like this,

195
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,135
it looks like
women's private parts!

196
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,138
Oh, Chris! You just
have a way of looking at things

197
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:54,074
that's delightfully fresh!

198
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,413
We're not supposed
to be doing this.

199
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,716
I bet we're not supposed
to be doing this.

200
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,952
Daddy!
You're all better!

201
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:06,837
That's right, pumpkin.

202
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,755
And I have an important
announcement to make.

203
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:11,324
I have decided
to change my will,

204
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,293
and name
my grandson Chris

205
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,762
the sole heir
to the Pewterschmidt fortune.

206
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,364
You what?
What? Oh, my!

207
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:21,901
Oh, no!
My hairless twin got out!

208
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,307
Hello, family.

209
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,276
Let's eat all
the garbage we want.

210
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:37,800
Daddy, you're seriously leaving
your entire estate to Chris?

211
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:39,836
I-I mean,
what about Mom?

212
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,605
I promise she'll be dead
before I am. I promise.

213
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,741
But, Grandpa, I don't
even want the money.

214
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,210
See? This is exactly
why you should get it!

215
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:48,377
So refreshing!

216
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:50,113
Well, I-I don't
want it, either.

217
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:51,681
Good, 'cause
you're not getting it.

218
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:53,182
Come on, what
are you doing?

219
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:55,384
Listen, Carter, you take
me out of your will,

220
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,453
I'm taking you
out of mine.

221
00:08:57,488 --> 00:09:00,423
Peter, that wasn't your will,
that was your birth certificate.

222
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,524
Oh, no!

223
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,093
There's no light!

224
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,928
There's only fire!

225
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,664
Look, Carter, I suppose you're
entitled to do what you want,

226
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:11,134
but, you know, I'm just
saying, if it were me,

227
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,236
I would give all the
money to charity.

228
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,437
Oh, yeah?
Which charity?

229
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,905
Well, there are
just so many

230
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,640
that do such
great work.

231
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:18,875
Name just one.

232
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:20,710
Um... well,
you know...

233
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:23,379
Poor... Green...

234
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:25,114
Whale... Guns...

235
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,349
Books?

236
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:28,484
You are
such a fraud.

237
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:31,687
Why won't anyone help us?!

238
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,194
What the hell?
I can't believe your dad's

239
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,729
giving all his cash
to Chris!

240
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:42,431
I know it's strange,
but in the end it's his money,

241
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,033
so who really cares?

242
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:45,601
Well, yeah, but...

243
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:47,170
But what?

244
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:50,206
Peter... did you marry
me for my money?

245
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,608
Of course not, Lois,
but even you can't deny

246
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:54,811
it was always gonna
be a huge perk.

247
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,780
D-Did I use that right? Perk?
Yes, Peter.

248
00:09:57,815 --> 00:09:59,813
Yeah, I thought so,
but then it just sounded

249
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:01,217
kind of weird when I said it.

250
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:02,485
It was fine.
Thanks.

251
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,388
Anyway, I don't plan on losing out
on any of that money.

252
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:08,658
So if you ask me, we got to start
sucking up to Chris right away.

253
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,593
What? Wh-What are
you talking about?

254
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,461
I'm talking about
brownnosing Chris

255
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:14,463
and getting on
his good side perk.

256
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:16,265
No, that's wrong.
No "perk."

257
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,235
Okay, my bad. But I've been
counting on that money, Lois.

258
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,637
It's always been critical
to my master plan.

259
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:23,105
What master plan?

260
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,341
Look, I never
told you this, but...

261
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,511
for years now, I've been
planning on retiring at 45

262
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,181
so I can work on finding a cure for
Ballzheimers disease.

263
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,717
Peter, are
those testicles?

264
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,319
Wh-where did
you get those?

265
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,788
I don't remember!

266
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:44,861
Hey, hey, there he is!

267
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,763
Oh, boy, hot dogs and
Nintendo, huh, Chris?

268
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:49,966
Dad, what are you doing?
What's going on?

269
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:52,301
Good one, Chris!

270
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:55,137
Good one!
Why are you dressed like that?

271
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:56,839
I don't know. I-I
just kind of felt

272
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:58,341
like this is what
cool people wear.

273
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,877
Hey, hey, Chris, how about you
and me do a secret handshake

274
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,979
that has way too many steps
to remember, all right?

275
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:05,781
Okay. Shake, bump, bump,
slap, pinky hook,

276
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:08,417
pretend to slick your hair back,
represent, bump,

277
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,319
one spin, slap high, slap low,

278
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,922
reverse spin, bump, explode,
shake, belly rub,

279
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,391
fake yawn, finger gun,
hitchhiker, hitchhiker,

280
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,693
shimmy shimmy sham sham,
shake, shake, shake, bump,

281
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:19,295
something smells
and shake again.

282
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:21,631
Okay, ready?

283
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,634
Oh, my God, it's nighttime.

284
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:30,506
MAN (on TV): We now return to the director's
cut of <i>Mission: Impossible 5,</i>

285
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,075
with the step stools
not edited out.

286
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,611
You're coming with me because
I'm definitely over six feet,

287
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:37,113
and you're not handsome.

288
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:38,848
Hey, Chris, hey,
you remember that kid

289
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:40,516
you said was bullying
you at school?

290
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,651
Well, here's his head!

291
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,153
That's not even him!

292
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:45,688
That's the deaf kid!

293
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:47,623
Oh, that was
sign language.

294
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:49,625
I thought he was
trying to defend himself

295
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,360
with terrible karate.

296
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,566
Chris, I want to share with you
a timeworn father/son tradition.

297
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:59,468
I am gonna show you
a film comedy

298
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,704
from my youth
that won't hold up.

299
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:04,240
Welcome to the classic comedy,
<i>Meatballs.</i>

300
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:05,641
Oh, that sounds great.

301
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:07,677
Is it about a pasta
factory or something?

302
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:09,078
No, that's part of the joke.

303
00:12:09,112 --> 00:12:10,446
Who's the guy?

304
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,415
That's not a guy.
That's the hot chick!

305
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:13,749
Where are her boobs?

306
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:15,651
Flat with a decent face
was the best

307
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:16,852
we could hope for back then.

308
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:19,088
Miley Cyrus had sex
with a foam finger

309
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:21,223
at, like, 6:00 p.m.
Central Time.

310
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:23,426
This movie has a canoe
that slowly sinks.

311
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,294
All right, you know what?
Forget it!

312
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,130
I'm just gonna take my VCR,
my VCR head-cleaning tape,

313
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,033
my VCR head-cleaning spray,
my head-cleaning rag,

314
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:33,970
and my rewinder, and just
get the hell out of here.

315
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,409
<i>We now return to</i> At the Movies

316
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:43,112
With Two Guys Who Watch
the Films On Their iPhones.

317
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,580
Good evening.
First off, we're going

318
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,334
to review Paul Greengrass'
<i>Captain Phillips.</i>

319
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,917
What did you think, Bill?

320
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:49,418
Well, it got off
to a great start,

321
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:51,821
but when it was my turn
to play <i>Words With Friends,</i>

322
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,155
it really took
me out of it.

323
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,757
Well, that's a shame,
because visually...

324
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,892
Ooh!

325
00:12:56,927 --> 00:13:00,763
<i>When we come back, the guys</i>
<i>will review</i> American Hustle.

326
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:02,231
Hmm?

327
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:03,933
Hey, you guys.

328
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,401
Geez, Peter,
you look exhausted.

329
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:07,603
Ugh, I am. I've
been busting my ass

330
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:09,939
for the last week trying
to suck up to Chris.

331
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,607
To Chris?
What the hell for?

332
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:12,875
Well, Carter
kind of decided

333
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,744
he's gonna leave all
his money to Chris.

334
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:16,912
So, I've been trying to
get on his good side.

335
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:18,848
I even cleaned his room
for him the other day.

336
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,549
Wish I hadn't done that.

337
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,986
Chris, our
bath is ready.

338
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:25,821
I... uh...

339
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,923
I don't... I don't know
what to do now.

340
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,159
I... I don't have
the parenting skills necessary

341
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:31,360
to deal with this.

342
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,295
I say we never
speak of this again.

343
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,531
I... I might move.

344
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,566
You know what?
I say, good for Chris

345
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,969
and whatever lucky girl
he ends up marrying.

346
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:42,405
Yeah, or lucky guy,
if he ends up being gay.

347
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:43,973
Lucky guy?

348
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,541
Wait a minute.

349
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,676
You guys just gave me an idea!

350
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,648
What's he doing up there?
He's a cat!

351
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:55,651
He can't play no tuba!

352
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,019
No, wait!

353
00:13:57,054 --> 00:13:59,288
Actually, you guys
gave me two ideas!

354
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:04,794
Mumbling while I sleep
to indicate dream content.

355
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:06,262
Chris, Chris, wake up.

356
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:08,397
I have something very
important to ask you.

357
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,634
Chris, there comes a time when
every man looks at his son

358
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:15,671
and thinks, "I want to take
this to the next level."

359
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,277
Chris Griffin...
will you marry me?

360
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:24,647
What?! Is it even legal
for a man to marry his son?

361
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:26,082
It is in Vermont.

362
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,184
As long as it's a man and a
man, anything goes up there.

363
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:30,086
They're a bunch of
liberal degenerates.

364
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,021
I don't know.
It seems really weird.

365
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:34,256
I mean, aren't men
supposed to marry women?

366
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,926
No, no, no, that's just
all of human history

367
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,561
except for the
last five months.

368
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:40,162
We'll just be
like best pals.

369
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:41,764
And besides, there's
plenty of people

370
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,466
who are married
and don't have sex.

371
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,067
Like Will Smith
and that pit bull.

372
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:47,002
Why do you even
want to marry me?

373
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:49,371
It's time to settle down
and simplify things,

374
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:52,174
like maybe having one ATM
card and one bank account.

375
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:53,642
Say, yours.

376
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:56,645
Oh. I get it.

377
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,280
So, what do you say?

378
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:02,418
When you're married, you get
to spend all your time together,

379
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:05,287
doing things like playing catch
and going fishing, right?

380
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,323
Well, the best marriages
give each other space,

381
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:08,557
but, yes, Chris.

382
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:11,227
Then, yes, I will
marry you, Dad!

383
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,696
Oh, that's
wonderful news!

384
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,065
You should know this
ring is very special.

385
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:18,033
It used to belong
to your mother.

386
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:20,035
Wait. What <i>about</i> Mom?

387
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,904
I'm afraid that's
over, Chris.

388
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:23,105
Lois, wake up.

389
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,207
I need you to sign
this legal document.

390
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:27,109
Huh? Wha-What is this?

391
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:29,245
It's a petition
to force that hot mom

392
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,413
to wear something appropriate
at PTA meetings.

393
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,315
Oh, thank God.

394
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,694
No, Dad.

395
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:48,130
I don't know
what normal is anymore.

396
00:15:56,944 --> 00:15:59,679
So now you know my complete
sexual history, Chris.

397
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:03,216
Wow. I'm surprised you got
fooled by a bear in a wig.

398
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,484
It wasn't a wig,
it was a hair system.

399
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,919
Well, whatever.

400
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:08,788
Why do we have
all these appointments?

401
00:16:08,822 --> 00:16:10,756
Wedding DJ, florist.

402
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,559
Because, Chris, it takes time
to plan a perfect wedding.

403
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:15,228
You don't want
to jump the gun.

404
00:16:15,262 --> 00:16:17,697
You know, like when you
respond to a text too quickly.

405
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:33,579
So, should we get started
with your bridal registry?

406
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:35,548
Yeah, um, I'd like
to furnish my kitchen

407
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:37,750
as if I'm the greatest
chef in the world,

408
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:39,018
even though I've
never cooked before.

409
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:40,620
That's what we do!
Okay, great.

410
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:42,521
All right, we'll start
with the nine grand

411
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,857
in copper-bottom
cookware.

412
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:51,664
Holy wack-a-zoly!

413
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:52,999
Dad!
What?

414
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,334
Don't "what" me.
You know what you did.

415
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:58,337
Hey, I may be your husband and
your dad, but I'm still a man.

416
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:04,210
Yeah, we're looking to plan our
post-wedding Sunday breakfast.

417
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:05,978
You know,
when everyone's sick of us.

418
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,179
Of course.

419
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:09,282
Excellent. Do you have
a table for the couple

420
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:11,617
that barely made it through
the weekend without breaking up?

421
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:13,386
Absolutely. Can I put
them near the couple

422
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,554
that hooked up drunk and now
have to make awkward small talk

423
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,109
until their cab to
the airport arrives?

424
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:18,557
Sure. And maybe
they could go next

425
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:20,059
to the vastly-underdressed
cousin

426
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:21,861
who thinks
the world revolves around him?

427
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:23,396
I have just the spot.

428
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,730
Will there be a
physically-frail,

429
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:25,898
fall-down uncle?

430
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:27,767
Indeed. And we'd like
to have him walk

431
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,135
through a maze
of chair legs.

432
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:30,469
Anything else?
Yes.

433
00:17:30,504 --> 00:17:31,904
We did invite
a black couple.

434
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:34,240
Um, even though we only met them
three months ago,

435
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:36,275
but we would like them
to be prominently featured

436
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,178
to let the other guests know how
tolerant and wonderful we are.

437
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:45,117
I'm excited for
your first dance.

438
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:46,819
And now we're
ready to add music.

439
00:17:46,853 --> 00:17:48,020
What's your song?

440
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:49,922
You know, I've given it
a lot of thought,

441
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:52,091
and I went with the most
romantic song ever,

442
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,594
"Stars And Stripes Forever"
by John Philip Sousa.

443
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,963
March! March!
March! March!

444
00:17:57,998 --> 00:17:59,732
Can you feel the
soldiers, Chris?

445
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:01,100
So many have fallen.

446
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:02,768
And this is why
they were fighting.

447
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:04,603
For a man to marry his son

448
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:06,105
in a state with
enough trees around

449
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:08,174
that nobody can
see what's going on.

450
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:16,482
It was nice of the
guests at the cat funeral

451
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:17,850
to stay for our wedding.

452
00:18:17,884 --> 00:18:19,585
Yeah, and I bet
you're especially happy

453
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:21,220
we're getting married
on a Thursday.

454
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:22,988
School, yuck, right?!

455
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:25,257
Welcome, friends, loved ones,

456
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,927
and people who are waiting
for the 3:00 check-in time

457
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,095
with nothing better to do.

458
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:30,896
Just let us put
our bags in there.

459
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:33,265
I'm literally gonna
grab my shorts and leave.

460
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,303
I understand the two of you
have written your own vows?

461
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:39,105
Chris, to express my love,

462
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:42,174
I turn to the words of the only
poet that blue collar,

463
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:45,811
New England scumbags
like me know: Robert Frost.

464
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:48,748
"Two roads diverged
in a wood, and I...

465
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:51,384
I took the one less traveled."

466
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:53,819
Now, I ain't no scholar,
but if that's not a metaphor

467
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:56,222
for major-league butt stuff,
I don't know what is.

468
00:18:56,256 --> 00:18:57,890
Thank you. Chris?

469
00:18:57,924 --> 00:18:59,658
Stop the wedding!

470
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:03,262
Lois! How did you
find out about this?

471
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:04,964
Peter, several people
have called the police

472
00:19:04,998 --> 00:19:06,465
about a man marrying his son.

473
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,900
It's not normal!

474
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:10,403
Peter? Peter
Griffin?

475
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:12,338
Oh, God.

476
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:13,973
Is everyone
from your past here

477
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,775
to walk you down
the aisle?!

478
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:17,243
Peter, you
cannot do this!

479
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:19,145
You cannot
marry your son!

480
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:21,113
I don't care how much
money Daddy's left him.

481
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:22,715
Don't listen
to your mother, Chris.

482
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:24,383
It's 'cause of her
we have bedtimes!

483
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:26,352
Chris, come on,
we're going home!

484
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:28,053
He can't make
you do this.

485
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:30,122
But, Mom,
I <i>want</i> to do this.

486
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:31,457
What?

487
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:35,161
I know he's marrying me
for my money, but I don't care.

488
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:37,930
Dad and I spent more time
together planning this wedding

489
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:39,565
than we ever have before.

490
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,100
And if being married means

491
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:45,204
I get to spend even more time
with my dad, then it's worth it.

492
00:19:45,238 --> 00:19:49,575
Wait. You knew all along I
just wanted you for your money?

493
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,011
Yeah, Dad, I did.

494
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:54,146
Wow.

495
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:56,715
Oh, boy, I've
been a real jerk.

496
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,217
I'm sorry, Chris.

497
00:19:58,251 --> 00:19:59,819
But you know what?

498
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:02,188
I'm gonna make it up to
you, starting right now.

499
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:05,591
Chris Griffin...
will you be my son?

500
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,793
Yes, Dad.

501
00:20:07,828 --> 00:20:12,131
OMG, the photographer is,
like, obsessed with me.

502
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:14,700
Well, let's all go home,
you guys.

503
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,936
I think we've had enough
excitement for one day.

504
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,904
Yeah, and
I guess I learned

505
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,706
it's wrong to take
your son to Vermont

506
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,107
under false
pretenses

507
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:24,076
to try to marry him
for his inheritance.

508
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,211
You... you should've
known that.

509
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:27,112
Well, we should
probably get going.

510
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:29,582
I think this
adventure is over.

511
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:32,539
<i>Interestingly, however,</i>
<i>I did run into Chris again.</i>

512
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,808
<i>It was on the Upper West</i>
<i>Side of Manhattan.</i>

513
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:37,546
<i>He was with another dad.</i>
<i>I was with another son.</i>

514
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:39,512
<i>But it was nice reminiscing</i>
<i>about old times.</i>

515
00:20:39,994 --> 00:20:41,128
<i>For you kids watching,</i>

516
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:42,851
<i>this is a reference</i>
<i>to a Woody Allen movie.</i>

517
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:45,072
<i>He also married one</i>
<i>of his children.</i>
