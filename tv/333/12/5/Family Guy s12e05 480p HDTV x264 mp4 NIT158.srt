12
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:36,499
Good afternoon, Quahog.

13
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,468
Our top story:
price wars are heating up

14
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:40,236
between all of
the major airlines

15
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:42,405
and even a couple of
the little crashy ones.

16
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,173
We now go live
to Tricia Takanawa

17
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,541
with more on the story.

18
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:49,112
Tom, I'm standing here at
Boston's Logan Airport,

19
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:51,080
where some of the same
security people

20
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:52,749
who let the terrorists
on the plane

21
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:54,717
are still gainfully employed.

22
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:57,553
With such low fares,
even those who never fly

23
00:00:57,588 --> 00:01:00,323
are lining up
to buy tickets.

24
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:01,524
Early reports suggest

25
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:03,593
that this could be
the most profitable day

26
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:06,329
for airlines in
the last two decades.

27
00:01:06,363 --> 00:01:07,630
I'm Tricia Takanawa.

28
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:08,765
Back to you, Tom.

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,799
Hi, Mom.

30
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,567
Hi, Joe.

31
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:13,369
Wow, Peter,
did you hear that?

32
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:14,404
Low airfares.

33
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,805
Why don't we
take a trip?

34
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:17,707
We never go
anywhere anymore.

35
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:18,708
We're gettin' stagnant.

36
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:19,709
What are you
talking about?

37
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:20,710
We go places.

38
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:22,845
We took that helicopter
tour of Tucson.

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,814
Wow. I've never seen
so many boats

40
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:26,683
not near bodies of water.

41
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,818
That park is all concrete.

42
00:01:28,852 --> 00:01:31,721
Look, there's a dog
tied to a other dog.

43
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:34,157
I think that guy with
long hair is a lawyer.

44
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:37,627
Look at all those students
running for their lives.

45
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:39,829
Oh, there's
the concrete park again.

46
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:42,298
Peter, I'm talking
about real travel.

47
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,467
We can finally afford
to go somewhere good.

48
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:45,835
Joe and Bonnie
went to Europe

49
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,437
and had the time
of their lives.

50
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:49,739
Hey, I know a place
you can go, Lois: Hell.

51
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:51,674
There, I said it.
Now shut your mouth.

52
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,076
Lois, I hate travelling.

53
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,111
Besides, my passport
picture is awful.

54
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:00,383
Ugh, you look like
a human cigarette.

55
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,118
But it's not just
about you, Peter.

56
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:03,286
Think about the family.

57
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,655
It would be an amazing
experience for the kids.

58
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:07,390
It would give them
some culture.

59
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:09,325
Lois, the kids can get
all the culture they need

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,560
right here in Quahog.

61
00:02:10,594 --> 00:02:11,561
Really?

62
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:12,829
More culture
than Europe?

63
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:14,697
That's right, and I'm
gonna prove it to you.

64
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:16,566
I got more culture
in my pinkie toe

65
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,001
than all of Europe
put together.

66
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:34,250
Oh, my God!

67
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:37,420
I got ringworm, too,
but it's not classy like this.

68
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:42,892
Okay, kids, now this is
the Quahog Museum of Science.

69
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:46,496
A magical place
of cultural exploration.

70
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:58,775
That sucked.

71
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,345
Now, one thing that
makes us more cultured

72
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:05,014
than our European counterparts
is high school football.

73
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,250
Then why are we standing here
in the parking lot?

74
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:08,951
Because sometimes
your team loses,

75
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:10,453
and you have to
beat up the ref.

76
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,023
What part
of Eatonville you from, huh?

77
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:15,858
What part of Eatonville
you from?

78
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:17,427
Ow! West Eatonville.

79
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:18,461
Oh, really?
West Eatonville?

80
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:19,762
Do you know Bob Hanley?

81
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:21,597
I'm Bob Hanley.
No kidding!

82
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:23,132
Bob, it's me, Peter Griffin.

83
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,967
Oh, my God,
how the hell are you?

84
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:26,803
I'm doing great.
I'm doing great.

85
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:28,004
Well, hey, oh, listen.

86
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,205
I was really sorry
to hear about your dad.

87
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,640
Oh, that means a lot.

88
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:32,708
Yeah, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it to the wake.

89
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:33,876
I was out of town.

90
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:35,344
It's okay.
Thanks for the flowers.

91
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:36,779
Oh, it's the least I could do.

92
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:37,914
Hey, Chris, get over here.

93
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:40,216
You got to meet
my buddy Bob Hanley.

94
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,452
Hi, Mr. Hanley.
I'm Chris.

95
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:45,555
I heard a lot about you, sir.

96
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,394
We now return
to <i>Downton Syndrome.</i>

97
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:53,729
Well, if I must accept
your proposal in order

98
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:56,199
to break the entail
and save my family's estate,

99
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,668
then yes, I will marry you.

100
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:00,470
Yay!

101
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:03,005
Everyone,
I've got a surprise.

102
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,808
Whoa!
I did not see that coming.

103
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:07,677
No, Chris,
I haven't said it yet.

104
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:09,846
Today was the last day
of the low airfares,

105
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,082
and I couldn't let
the opportunity pass, so...

106
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:15,418
I got us tickets to Italy!

107
00:04:15,452 --> 00:04:16,853
That's amazing, Mom!

108
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:18,287
Lois, is Peter
okay with this?

109
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:21,357
Well, Brian, I haven't
quite told him yet.

110
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,658
But what if he says no?

111
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:24,227
He can't say no.

112
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:25,695
I already
bought the tickets.

113
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:26,696
Tickets for what?

114
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,763
Uh, uh...

115
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:30,299
tickets for the, um,
the grand opening

116
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:33,469
of the biggest water park
in all of Rhode Island.

117
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,338
Hmm, well, pardon
my skepticism, Lois,

118
00:04:35,372 --> 00:04:37,406
but I didn't read
about this in the latest issue

119
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:39,509
of <i>Water Park Enthusiast Weekly.</i>

120
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:42,879
Well, they-they had
to, um, keep it secret.

121
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:45,414
For fear that, um...

122
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:46,916
th-that this new park would put

123
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,152
all other water parks
out of business.

124
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:50,453
Typical Big Water.

125
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:52,155
Always keeping the
public in the dark.

126
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:54,390
So this one's bigger
than Raging Waters?

127
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:56,125
Yeah, Dad.
It's way bigger.

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,326
How does the boy know?

129
00:04:57,361 --> 00:04:58,661
Uh, because I-I told him.

130
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:00,863
I-I know someone who-who helped,
uh, build it.

131
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:03,199
Wow, so we really got an
inside track on this thing.

132
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,234
But it can't be bigger
than Six Flags Atlantis.

133
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,336
Oh, it is, Peter, it is.

134
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:08,538
Because...

135
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:11,407
it's Seven Flags Atlantis.

136
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:14,010
That's a whole flag
more of water!

137
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:15,211
Get in the car!

138
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:17,380
Okay, everyone,
put the sunblock on now,

139
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:19,415
so when we get off the plane,
we go right to the park.

140
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,150
Wait, why are we on a plane?

141
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:23,586
Uh, you-you want to beat the
lines, don't you, Peter?

142
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,887
All-all right, Brian, enough.

143
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:27,056
I-I can't
do this anymore.

144
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,425
Peter, we're not
going to a water park.

145
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,060
We're going to Italy.

146
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:33,629
What?! But what about
Seven Flags Atlantis?

147
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:35,031
Peter, don't be silly.

148
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:36,899
Th-There's no such place.

149
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,267
This is your captain speaking.

150
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:40,369
If you look out the left side
of the airplane,

151
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:43,105
you'll see the very popular
Seven Flags Atlantis.

152
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,941
Aw!

153
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,379
I'm gonna go ahead
and turn off the seatbelt sign,

154
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:54,183
so you idiots can all stretch
and let the fart festival begin.

155
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:55,885
Why are you such
a dick, Jim?

156
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,354
I'm just mad
about pilot stuff.

157
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,081
I can't believe you tricked
me into going to Italy.

158
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,417
Peter, our family could use
a trip like this.

159
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,053
Plus, it might be good
for you and me, too.

160
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:14,189
It's the most romantic country
in the whole world.

161
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:16,692
And God knows we could use a
little romance in our marriage.

162
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:17,960
What are you talking about?

163
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:20,062
Just the other night
we did that role-playing.

164
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:23,499
Did you like that game of
mysterious intruder, Lois?

165
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,301
I told you--
I don't know who you are.

166
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:27,102
And my name isn't Lois.

167
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,504
Mine is.

168
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,439
Let's do it again.

169
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,548
Is it true there's
no drinking age here?

170
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:41,317
And they serve wine
at every meal?

171
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:44,053
Oh, Meg, nobody
likes a drunky-chunky.

172
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:47,356
In college, a lot of guys
are gonna make you a dare.

173
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,926
Hey, you know what, guys?
We're six hours ahead here.

174
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,761
I'm gonna call Joe
and tell him the future.

175
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:56,665
Hey, Joe, guess
what's about to happen?

176
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,733
Who is this?

177
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:58,734
It's Peter.

178
00:06:58,768 --> 00:06:59,768
That's impossible.

179
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:01,603
Peter died six hours ago.

180
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,772
We can't go back.

181
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:15,150
Look, kids,
this is the Forum,

182
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,685
where the ancient Romans
used to have

183
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,487
their famous
political debates.

184
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,223
And this is the <i>Penthouse</i> Forum,
where dirtbags write letters

185
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:23,325
about boning in the
back of grocery stores.

186
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,440
Well, who wants to see where
the ancients established

187
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:27,896
the foundation of
our American democracy?

188
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:30,132
And who wants to hear
a story about a girl

189
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,926
who moved to New York
without any underpants?

190
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,570
I don't know
why we even go places.

191
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,805
We always just end up
reading pornography.

192
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:42,978
We now return
to <i>Italian Star Trek.</i>

193
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:45,180
I know I supposed
to be-a so logical,

194
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,283
but I get-a so steaming a-mad!

195
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:51,520
Peter, the kids are going
to the Italian circus,

196
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,889
so I thought
it might be romantic

197
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:56,191
if we watched the sunset
from St. Peter's Basilica.

198
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,266
You go ahead, I'm gonna stay
here and get frustrated

199
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:01,230
with this nonresponsive
hotel TV remote.

200
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,499
Come on! Guide!

201
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,534
I'm pressing "Guide"!

202
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:10,139
Stupid remote's
not doing anything!

203
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:16,311
Stop what you're doing!

204
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:18,280
Peter, you can't just
sit in front of the TV

205
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:19,615
the entire vacation.

206
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:21,183
You know, I'm really getting
tired of you being

207
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:22,951
such a complete
stick-in-the-mud.

208
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,553
Is that some kind
of gay slur?

209
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,188
I can't believe it's
too much for you

210
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,623
to watch a sunset
with your wife

211
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:29,691
in one of the most romantic
cities in the world!

212
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:30,826
But, you know what?

213
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,060
It's probably for the best.

214
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,896
Because you'd just
complain about it!

215
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,531
Well, what do you expect, Lois?
I didn't want to come here

216
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,800
he first place.
I'd rather be back home.

217
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,402
You know, I could be
riding seesaw with Joe.

218
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,438
Yay!

219
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,841
Well, I guess we're stuck.

220
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,210
Hang on.
Let me empty this bag.

221
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,479
Yay, gross.

222
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,414
Fine, you just sit
here on the couch.

223
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,551
I'll go enjoy
Italy without you!

224
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,121
God, what the hell's
her problem?

225
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,556
You know, sometimes
I think you forget

226
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,957
how lucky you
are to have Lois.

227
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,560
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
acting like such a jerk.

228
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,128
Oh, I'm getting it
from you now?

229
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:07,296
Don't worry about Lois.

230
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,931
She's an American woman
in Italy.

231
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,499
She'll go out,
kill her roommate

232
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,468
during a sex game,
and then she'll be fine.

233
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,169
She might come back
even hotter.

234
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:15,904
Well, you might want
to look out there.

235
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,076
What the hell's she doing
with that Italian guy?

236
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,014
Hey, guys? Do I got to tip

237
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,750

Brian? What happened?

269
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:52,534
I was watching you
from the window.

270
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,102
When Lois pulled away
on that motorcycle,

00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:56,204
you laid down on the ground
and went to sleep.

for God's sake,

00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:54,756
It could go either way.
Let's start making choices.

318
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,692
Oh, Peter...

319
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:58,660
I love you.

320
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,996
I love you, too.

321
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,874
Wow, Peter, last night was
the best sex I've ever had.

322
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,843
Me, too.

323
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,678
We haven't done it like that
since we were engaged

324
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,848
but allowed to sleep
with other people.

325
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,517
The point is, Italy is the best
thing that ever happened to us.

326
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,586
I know, it's been
wonderful.

327
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,321
I wish we never
had to leave.

328
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:28,790
Well, then, let's not.
Let's live here.

329
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,459
What? Peter, but...

330
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,928
but we've built a life
back in Quahog.

331
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:34,296
Yeah, but you
were right, Lois,

332
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,997
we were stagnating
back home.

333
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,333
Let's start a new life,
right here in Italy.

334
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:43,638
Peter, those were our passports!

335
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:44,806
We don't need them anymore.

336
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:46,942
Kids, I got an announcement.

337
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:48,376
He's wearing
a rubber.

338
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,812
We're staying in Italy.
We're Italian now.

339
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,147
What?!
Are you kidding?!

340
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,482
Well, if we're
going to be Italian,

341
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:55,717
I guess we should start
murdering our brothers.

342
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,553
What are you...?

343
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,388
You break-a
my heart, Chris.

344
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,857
You break-a my heart.

345
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,961
Hey, Peter,
what's-a you rush?

346
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:17,564
I got-a the most beautiful woman
in the world at home,

347
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:19,399
and I no wanna keep her waiting.

348
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:22,068
Hey, Vincenzo,
play me a tune, huh?

349
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:27,740
Oh, Vincenzo!
<i>Insalata Caprese!</i>

350
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:32,545
Ah, Italy.

351
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,913
It 9:00 a.m.

352
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:36,015
and I've already kissed
eight guys twice.

353
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,951
Why-a you looking
at other babies, huh?

354
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:40,053
Why you make-a me
do that, Ruperto?

355
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,221
I no wanna do that!

356
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,555
Peter, I know you
love it here,

357
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,990
but riding your
bike around town

358
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:45,158
isn't paying the bills,

359
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:46,860
and the kids aren't
learning anything

360
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:48,628
at that Italian school.

361
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:50,463
Look at these
big ones, huh?

362
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:51,798
Rut-ta-ta ta-ta,

363
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:54,534
rut-ta-ta ta-ta,
rut-ta-ta ta-ta!

364
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:55,802
Is this calculus?

365
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:56,970
I don't know.

366
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:59,139
Rut-ta-ta ta-ta!

367
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:00,406
I think maybe it's time

368
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,642
to go back to our
real home in Quahog.

369
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:04,244
But I thought
you loved Italy.

370
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,645
And Italian Peter.

371
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,247
And Southern
Italian Peter.

372
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,882
Olive oil!

373
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,818
I do, but I love
American Peter even more.

374
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:12,986
Lois is right.

375
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,354
We're barely
surviving here.

376
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:15,889
I mean, you have to give
most of what you earn

377
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:18,625
to the mafia that
terrorizes this village.

378
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,163
Peter, I think it's time
we all go back home.

379
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:58,598
Of course we have to leave

380
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:00,700
as soon as I get
an Italian boyfriend.

381
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:01,768
You know, I still
don't understand

382
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,069
what he does for a living.

383
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:05,438
He gathers coins from the air
by jumping on mushrooms.

384
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:07,240
What's so hard to understand?!

385
00:16:08,642 --> 00:16:10,343
Hey, Meg, let's go-a
two-player!

386
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:12,011
I got-a Luigi
here, huh?

387
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:13,079
Hey, Meg-a!

388
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:16,249
Mario said-a you were
into-a weird-a stuff.

389
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:21,087
So, you see, Mr. Consulate,

390
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:23,289
all we want to do is get back
to our home in America.

391
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:25,458
So, can we have
our new passports now?

392
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:27,360
Mr. Griffin, it's not
as simple as that.

393
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:29,462
Your family must take
a citizenship test

394
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:30,997
and go through
the immigration process

395
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,665
like any other
foreigner.

396
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,767
Foreigner?
We're not foreigners.

397
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:35,802
Sorry, Mrs. Griffin.

398
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:37,570
Not only did you
destroy your passports,

399
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,505
you renounced our citizenship.

400
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,640
When did we do that?

401
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:41,708
Oh, I did that

402
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:43,176
on the Italian social
networking site,

403
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,811
"Shut-up-a-you-facebook."

404
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,889
All right, Meg, part of
being an American citizen

405
00:16:56,924 --> 00:17:00,159
is having an opinion on certain
hot-button political issues.

406
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:02,528
Now, what is your
abortion stance?

407
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,164
It's pretty much this.

408
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,501
Now, if you will,
please sing

409
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:10,937
the national anthem
of the United States.

410
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:14,140
♪ O say can you see

411
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:18,344
♪ By the dawn's early light

412
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:21,614

413
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:25,118

414
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:28,121
♪ And I...

415
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:29,255
♪ Eee-I...

416
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,861
♪ Will always love you-ooh...

417
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:37,530
♪ Oh-I-ee-I...

418
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,499
Okay, I've reviewed
your application.

419
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:40,867
Now, where
you listed employment,

420
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:42,502
some of you wrote "Family Guy,"

421
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:44,370
and others wrote
"The Family Guy."

422
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:45,471
Which one is it?

423
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,675
It's "Family Guy."

424
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:49,942
All right,
now that you've completed

425
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:51,110
your initial application,

426
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:53,065
it will need to be filed
by an immigration lawyer

427
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,082
at a cost of approximately
$5,000 per person.

428
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,817
And assuming
that all goes through,

429
00:17:57,851 --> 00:18:00,987
you should have your
citizenship back in 16 months.

430
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:02,322
Sixteen months?

431
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:03,790
If I didn't know any better,

432
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:05,058
I'd think you were making it

433
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,859
hard to become
a citizen on purpose.

434
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:09,662
Like you don't want any
immigrants coming to the U.S.

435
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,097
I wish that were true,
Mrs. Griffin,

436
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:12,699
and it probably might be.

437
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,535
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go sit on my fat wife.

438
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:18,738
I'm ready for you,
String Bean!

439
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:20,506
What a weird guy.

440
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,908
Oh, this is terrible.

441
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:23,676
Peter, what are
we going to do?

442
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,211
I'll tell you what
we're going to do.

443
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:26,479
We're going
to sneak in.

444
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:28,181
Well, we better get there soon.

445
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:31,417
I want to be there for opening
night of <i>Karate Kid 5.</i>

446
00:18:31,452 --> 00:18:33,252
Mr. Miyagi, this is
kind of embarrassing,

447
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:36,222
but I'm having a problem
with erectile dysfunction.

448
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:38,424
Aye, Daniel-san.
Miyagi fix.

449
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:54,000
Well, I'm so glad to finally
be back home in Quahog.

450
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:55,435
Although,
I will miss Italy.

451
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:59,071
You made the trip very
special for me, Peter.

452
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:01,007
Well, thanks for showing
me and the kids

453
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,775
what the rest of
the world is like, Lois.

454
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,710
I think we all learned a lot.

455
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,245
And we met a lot
of great people.

456
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,448
Hey, what about that
couple we met in Amalfi?

457
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:09,482
Did you get their number?

458
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:10,516
I did. You ready?
Yup.

459
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:14,620
Okay, it's
19-565-55018...

460
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,889
81-453...

461
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,591
989-90...

462
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:22,628
016-8945-2.

463
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:25,031
Well, I can't wait to see the
rest of the world with you guys.

464
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:29,635
Mario! You came for me!

465
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,537
Come with me, Meg,
my princess.

466
00:20:31,572 --> 00:20:34,740
We gonna take this relationship
to the next level.

467
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:42,644
Luigi's here again?

468
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:44,398
I thought that was
a one-time thing.

469
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:46,517
He like-a my sloppy seconds.

470
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:47,485
We-a plumber brothers.

471
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,487
We-a not-a high class people.

472
