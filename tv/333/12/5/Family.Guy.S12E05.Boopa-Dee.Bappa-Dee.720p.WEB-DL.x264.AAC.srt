11
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,668
Good afternoon, Quahog.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,637
Our top story:
price wars are heating up

13
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,572
between all of
the major airlines

14
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,808
and even a couple of
the little crashy ones.

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,510
We now go live
to Tricia Takanawa

16
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:45,711
with more on the story.

17
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,415
Tom, I'm standing here at
Boston's Logan Airport,

18
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,383
where some of the same
security people

19
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,985
who let the terrorists
on the plane

20
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:54,920
are still gainfully employed.

21
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,723
With such low fares,
even those who never fly

22
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,692
are lining up
to buy tickets.

23
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:01,760
Early reports suggest

24
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,862
that this could be
the most profitable day

25
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:06,765
for airlines in
the last two decades.

26
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:07,900
I'm Tricia Takanawa.

27
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,068
Back to you, Tom.

28
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,102
Hi, Mom.

29
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,837
(in Joe's voice):
Hi, Joe.

30
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,839
Wow, Peter,
did you hear that?

31
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:14,606
Low airfares.

32
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,108
Why don't we
take a trip?

33
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,010
We never go
anywhere anymore.

34
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,011
We're gettin' stagnant.

35
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,012
What are you
talking about?

36
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:21,013
We go places.

37
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,182
We took that helicopter
tour of Tucson.

38
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,117
Wow. I've never seen
so many boats

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,952
not near bodies of water.

40
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,121
That park is all concrete.

41
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:32,024
Look, there's a dog
tied to a other dog.

42
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,560
I think that guy with
long hair is a lawyer.

43
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:37,896
Look at all those students
running for their lives.

44
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,132
Oh, there's
the concrete park again.

45
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,734
Peter, I'm talking
about real travel.

46
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,703
We can finally afford
to go somewhere good.

47
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,138
Joe and Bonnie
went to Europe

48
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,639
and had the time
of their lives.

49
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,042
Hey, I know a place
you can go, Lois: Hell.

50
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:51,944
There, I said it.
Now shut your mouth.

51
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,445
Lois, I hate travelling.

52
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,514
Besides, my passport
picture is awful.

53
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,819
Ugh, you look like
a human cigarette.

54
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,588
But it's not just
about you, Peter.

55
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,789
Think about the family.

56
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,991
It would be an amazing
experience for the kids.

57
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,659
It would give them
some culture.

58
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,828
Lois, the kids can get
all the culture they need

59
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,896
right here in Quahog.

60
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:11,897
Really?

61
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,232
More culture
than Europe?

62
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,067
That's right, and I'm
gonna prove it to you.

63
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,902
I got more culture
in my pinkie toe

64
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,470
than all of Europe
put together.

65
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,574
(singing opera)

66
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,418
(wild applause)

67
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,753
Oh, my God!

68
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,990
I got ringworm, too,
but it's not classy like this.

69
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,295
Okay, kids, now this is
the Quahog Museum of Science.

70
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:46,798
A magical place
of cultural exploration.

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,835
♪

72
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,178
That sucked.

73
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,948
Now, one thing that
makes us more cultured

74
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,517
than our European counterparts
is high school football.

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,819
Then why are we standing here
in the parking lot?

76
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,454
Because sometimes
your team loses,

77
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,856
and you have to
beat up the ref.

78
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,526
What part
of Eatonville you from, huh?

79
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,328
What part of Eatonville
you from?

80
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,796
Ow! West Eatonville.

81
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:18,830
Oh, really?
West Eatonville?

82
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,199
Do you know Bob Hanley?

83
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm Bob Hanley.
No kidding!

84
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,669
Bob, it's me, Peter Griffin.

85
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,470
Oh, my God,
how the hell are you?

86
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,239
I'm doing great.
I'm doing great.

87
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,507
Well, hey, oh, listen.

88
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,741
I was really sorry
to hear about your dad.

89
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,043
Oh, that means a lot.

90
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,145
Yeah, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it to the wake.

91
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,346
I was out of town.

92
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,914
It's okay.
Thanks for the flowers.

93
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,216
Oh, it's the least I could do.

94
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:38,383
Hey, Chris, get over here.

95
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,752
You got to meet
my buddy Bob Hanley.

96
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,821
Hi, Mr. Hanley.
I'm Chris.

97
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,958
I heard a lot about you, sir.

98
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,997
We now return
to <i>Downton Syndrome.</i>

99
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,166
Well, if I must accept
your proposal in order

100
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,735
to break the entail
and save my family's estate,

101
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,071
then yes, I will marry you.

102
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,906
Yay!

103
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,575
Everyone,
I've got a surprise.

104
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,345
Whoa!
I did not see that coming.

105
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,180
No, Chris,
I haven't said it yet.

106
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,382
Today was the last day
of the low airfares,

107
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,685
and I couldn't let
the opportunity pass, so...

108
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,854
I got us tickets to Italy!

109
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,389
That's amazing, Mom!

110
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,924
Lois, is Peter
okay with this?

111
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,027
Well, Brian, I haven't
quite told him yet.

112
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,128
But what if he says no?

113
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,863
He can't say no.

114
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,198
I already
bought the tickets.

115
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,199
Tickets for what?

116
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,267
Uh, uh...

117
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,936
tickets for the, um,
the grand opening

118
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,905
of the biggest water park
in all of Rhode Island.

119
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,974
Hmm, well, pardon
my skepticism, Lois,

120
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,809
but I didn't read
about this in the latest issue

121
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,945
of   <i>Water Park Enthusiast Week.</i>

122
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,415
Well, they-they had
to, um, keep it secret.

123
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,817
For fear that, um...

124
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,452
th-that this new park would put

125
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,755
all other water parks
out of business.

126
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:50,889
Typical Big Water.

127
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,758
Always keeping the
public in the dark.

128
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,060
So this one's bigger
than Raging Waters?

129
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,728
Yeah, Dad.
It's way bigger.

130
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,963
How does the boy know?

131
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,131
Uh, because I-I told him.

132
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,466
I-I know someone who-who helped,
uh, build it.

133
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,902
Wow, so we really got an
inside track on this thing.

134
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,937
But it can't be bigger
than Six Flags Atlantis.

135
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,073
Oh, it is, Peter, it is.

136
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,074
Because...

137
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,910
it's Seven Flags Atlantis.

138
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,646
(gasps) That's a whole flag
more of water!

139
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,914
Get in the car!

140
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,849
Okay, everyone,
put the sunblock on now,

141
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,918
so when we get off the plane,
we go right to the park.

142
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,820
Wait, why are we on a plane?

143
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,122
Uh, you-you want to beat the
lines, don't you, Peter?

144
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,490
All-all right, Brian, enough.

145
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,693
I-I can't
do this anymore.

146
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,928
Peter, we're not
going to a water park.

147
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,697
We're going to Italy.

148
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,166
What?! But what about
Seven Flags Atlantis?

149
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,667
Peter, don't be silly.

150
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,502
Th-There's no such place.

151
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,970
(over P.A.):
This is your captain speaking.

152
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,106
If you look out the left side
of the airplane,

153
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,775
you'll see the very popular
Seven Flags Atlantis.

154
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,544
Aw!

155
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:49,114
(children laughing)

156
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,116
I'm gonna go ahead
and turn off the seatbelt sign,

157
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:54,853
so you idiots can all stretch
and let the fart festival begin.

158
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,488
Why are you such
a dick, Jim?

159
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,091
I'm just mad
about pilot stuff.

160
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,066
I can't believe you tricked
me into going to Italy.

161
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,235
Peter, our family could use
a trip like this.

162
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:13,038
Plus, it might be good
for you and me, too.

163
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,974
It's the most romantic country
in the whole world.

164
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,577
And God knows we could use a
little romance in our marriage.

165
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,911
What are you talking about?

166
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,047
Just the other night
we did that role-playing.

167
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,350
Did you like that game of
mysterious intruder, Lois?

168
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,085
I told you--
I don't know who you are.

169
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,087
And my name isn't Lois.

170
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,355
Mine is.

171
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,290
Let's do it again.

172
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,400
Is it true there's
no drinking age here?

173
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,101
And they serve wine
at every meal?

174
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:46,037
Oh, Meg, nobody
likes a drunky-chunky.

175
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,174
In college, a lot of guys
are gonna make you a dare.

176
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,878
Hey, you know what, guys?
We're six hours ahead here.

177
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,679
I'm gonna call Joe
and tell him the future.

178
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,214
(buttons beeping)

179
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,550
Hey, Joe, guess
what's about to happen?

180
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,618
Who is this?

181
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,619
It's Peter.

182
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,753
That's impossible.

183
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,555
Peter died six hours ago.

184
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,589
(gasps)

185
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,791
We can't go back.

186
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,968
Look, kids,
this is the Forum,

187
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,637
where the ancient Romans
used to have

188
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,405
their famous
political debates.

189
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:23,074
And this is the <i>Penthouse</i> Forum,
where dirtbags write letters

190
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,210
about boning in the
back of grocery stores.

191
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,312
Well, who wants to see where
the ancients established

192
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,915
the foundation of
our American democracy?

193
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,217
And who wants to hear
a story about a girl

194
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,885
who moved to New York
without any underpants?

195
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,488
I don't know
why we even go places.

196
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,824
We always just end up
reading pornography.

197
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,996
We now return
to <i>Italian Star Trek.</i>

198
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,998
I know I supposed
to be-a so logical,

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,135
but I get-a so steaming a-mad!

200
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,438
Peter, the kids are going
to the Italian circus,

201
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,907
so I thought
it might be romantic

202
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,009
if we watched the sunset
from St. Peter's Basilica.

203
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,111
You go ahead, I'm gonna stay
here and get frustrated

204
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,148
with this nonresponsive
hotel TV remote.

205
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,484
Come on! Guide!

206
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,552
I'm pressing "Guide"!

207
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,324
Stupid remote's
not doing anything!

208
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,263
Stop what you're doing!

209
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,198
Peter, you can't just
sit in front of the TV

210
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,633
the entire vacation.

211
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,101
You know, I'm really getting
tired of you being

212
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,036
such a complete
stick-in-the-mud.

213
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,538
Is that some kind
of gay slur?

214
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,106
I can't believe it's
too much for you

215
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,641
to watch a sunset
with your wife

216
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,710
in one of the most romantic
cities in the world!

217
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:32,878
But, you know what?

218
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,179
It's probably for the best.

219
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,981
Because you'd just
complain about it!

220
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,516
Well, what do you expect, Lois?
I didn't want to come here

221
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,851
in the first place.
I'd rather be back home.

222
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,354
You know, I could be
riding seesaw with Joe.

223
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,422
Yay!

224
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,893
Well, I guess we're stuck.

225
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,128
Hang on.
Let me empty this bag.

226
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,464
Yay, gross.

227
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,366
Fine, you just sit
here on the couch.

228
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,569
I'll go enjoy
Italy without you!

229
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,239
God, what the hell's
her problem?

230
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,641
You know, sometimes
I think you forget

231
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,142
how lucky you
are to have Lois.

232
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,645
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
acting like such a jerk.

233
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,079
Oh, I'm getting it
from you now?

234
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,314
Don't worry about Lois.

235
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,082
She's an American woman
in Italy.

236
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,551
She'll go out,
kill her roommate

237
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,519
during a sex game,
and then she'll be fine.

238
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,154
She might come back
even hotter.

239
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,089
Well, you might want
to look out there.

240
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,261
What the hell's she doing
with that Italian guy?

241
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,696
(door opens, closes)

242
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:28,199
CHRIS:

243
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,869

I think so, I-I haven't

277
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,519
I was watching you
from the window.

278
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,254
When Lois pulled away
on that motorcycle,

you laid down on the ground

Okay, I'll admit it--
this is pretty romantic.

318
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,523
Listen, Lois.

319
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,792
I'm sorry for being
such a jerk, all right?

320
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,527
I love you.

321
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,098
I want to have your baby.

322
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,701
Peter, not on a boat.

323
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,136
Peter...

324
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,771
Oh, Peter...

325
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,539
Come on, Lois, I got
a ninety-percenter going.

326
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,975
It could go either way.
Let's start making choices.

327
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,910
Oh, Peter...

328
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,879
I love you.

329
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,381
I love you, too.

330
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,226
Wow, Peter, last night was
the best sex I've ever had.

331
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,162
Me, too.

332
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,963
We haven't done it like that
since we were engaged

333
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,665
but allowed to sleep
with other people.

334
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,167
What-What are you
talking about?

335
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,769
The point is, Italy is the best
thing that ever happened to us.

336
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,838
I know, it's been
wonderful.

337
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,506
I wish we never
had to leave.

338
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:31,109
Well, then, let's not.
Let's live here.

339
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,677
What? Peter, but...

340
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,280
but we've built a life
back in Quahog.

341
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:36,481
Yeah, but you
were right, Lois,

342
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,349
we were stagnating
back home.

343
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,552
Let's start a new life,
right here in Italy.

344
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,924
Peter, those were our passports!

345
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,125
We don't need them anymore.

346
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,294
Kids, I got an announcement.

347
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,595
He's wearing
a rubber.

348
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:53,131
We're staying in Italy.
We're Italian now.

349
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,532
What?!
Are you kidding?!

350
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,700
Well, if we're
going to be Italian,

351
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,036
I guess we should start
murdering our brothers.

352
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,805
What are you...?
(gagging)

353
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,674
You break-a
my heart, Chris.

354
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,275
You break-a my heart.

355
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,320
("Funiculi Funicula" plays)

356
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,387
(bicycle bell dings)

357
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,456
Hey, Peter,
what's-a you rush?

358
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,192
I got-a the most beautiful woman
in the world at home,

359
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,994
and I no wanna keep her waiting.

360
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,563
Hey, Vincenzo,
play me a tune, huh?

361
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,066
(playing "Yankee Doodle Dandy")

362
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,402
Oh, Vincenzo!

("Funiculi Funicula" resumes)

364
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,174
Ah, Italy.

365
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,642
It 9:00 a.m.

366
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,510
and I've already kissed
eight guys twice.

367
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,412
Why-a you looking
at other babies, huh?

368
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,581
Why you make-a me
do that, Ruperto?

369
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,816
I no wanna do that!

370
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,217
Peter, I know you
love it here,

371
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,518
but riding your
bike around town

372
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,720
isn't paying the bills,

373
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,588
and the kids aren't
learning anything

374
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,323
at that Italian school.

375
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,092
Look at these
big ones, huh?

376
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,493
Rut-ta-ta ta-ta,

377
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,162
rut-ta-ta ta-ta,
rut-ta-ta ta-ta!

378
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,497
Is this calculus?

379
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,431
I don't know.

380
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,734
Rut-ta-ta ta-ta!

381
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,068
I think maybe it's time

382
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,371
to go back to our
real home in Quahog.

383
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,872
But I thought
you loved Italy.

384
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,374
And Italian Peter.

385
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,875
And Southern
Italian Peter.

386
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,677
Olive oil!

387
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,580
I do, but I love
American Peter even more.

388
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,547
Lois is right.

389
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,016
We're barely
surviving here.

390
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,684
I mean, you have to give
most of what you earn

391
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,353
to the mafia that
terrorizes this village.

392
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,422
(tires screeching)

393
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,758
Peter, I think it's time
we all go back home.

394
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,393
(sighs):
Of course we have to leave

395
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,495
as soon as I get
an Italian boyfriend.

396
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,596
You know, I still
don't understand

397
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,731
what he does for a living.

398
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,167
He gathers coins from the air
by jumping on mushrooms.

399
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,935
What's so hard to understand?!

400
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,403
("Super Mario Bros."
music plays)

401
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,072
Hey, Meg, let's go-a
two-player!

402
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,640
I got-a Luigi
here, huh?

403
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,741
Hey, Meg-a!

404
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,978
Mario said-a you were
into-a weird-a stuff.

405
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,749
So, you see, Mr. Consulate,

406
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,985
all we want to do is get back
to our home in America.

407
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,187
So, can we have
our new passports now?

408
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,089
Mr. Griffin, it's not
as simple as that.

409
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,191
Your family must take
a citizenship test

410
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,625
and go through
the immigration process

411
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,461
like any other
foreigner.

412
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,596
Foreigner?
We're not foreigners.

413
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,630
Sorry, Mrs. Griffin.

414
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,332
Not only did you
destroy your passports,

415
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,267
you renounced our citizenship.

416
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,435
When did we do that?

417
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,503
Oh, I did that

418
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,838
on the Italian social
networking site,

419
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,673
"Shut-up-a-you-facebook."

420
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,718
All right, Meg, part of
being an American citizen

421
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,888
is having an opinion on certain
hot-button political issues.

422
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,357
Now, what is your
abortion stance?

423
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,926
It's pretty much this.

424
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,330
Now, if you will,
please sing

425
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,632
the national anthem
of the United States.

Okay, I've reviewed
your application.

436
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,762
Now, where
you listed employment,

437
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,330
some of you wrote "Family Guy,"

438
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,166
and others wrote
"The Family Guy."

439
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,300
Which one is it?

440
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,537
(sighs):
It's "Family Guy."

441
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,604
All right,
now that you've completed

442
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,839
your initial application,

443
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,741
it will need to be filed
by an immigration lawyer

444
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,777
at a cost of approximately
$5,000 per person.

445
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,712
And assuming
that all goes through,

446
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,749
you should have your
citizenship back in 16 months.

447
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,184
Sixteen months?

448
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,752
If I didn't know any better,

449
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,853
I'd think you were making it

450
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,855
hard to become
a citizen on purpose.

451
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,591
Like you don't want any
immigrants coming to the U.S.

452
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,859
I wish that were true,
Mrs. Griffin,

453
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,627
and it probably might be.

454
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,430
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go sit on my fat wife.

455
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,700
WOMAN:
I'm ready for you,
String Bean!

456
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,402
What a weird guy.

457
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:25,636
Oh, this is terrible.

458
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,605
Peter, what are
we going to do?

459
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,040
I'll tell you what
we're going to do.

460
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,374
We're going
to sneak in.

461
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,976
Well, we better get there soon.

462
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,279
I want to be there for opening
night of <i>Karate Kid 5.</i>

463
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,081
Mr. Miyagi, this is
kind of embarrassing,

464
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,051
but I'm having a problem
with erectile dysfunction.

465
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,320
Aye, Daniel-san.
Miyagi fix.

466
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,463
(horn honks)

467
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,989
(crane whirring)

468
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,789
(clearing throat)

469
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,828
Well, I'm so glad to finally
be back home in Quahog.

470
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,363
Although,
I will miss Italy.

471
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,900
You made the trip very
special for me, Peter.

472
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,835
Well, thanks for showing
me and the kids

473
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,804
what the rest of
the world is like, Lois.

474
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,706
I think we all learned a lot.

475
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,141
