12
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,500
Good afternoon, Quahog.

13
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:38,469
Our top story:
price wars are heating up

14
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:40,237
between all of
the major airlines

15
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:42,406
and even a couple of
the little crashy ones.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,174
We now go live
to Tricia Takanawa

17
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:45,542
with more on the story.

18
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:49,113
Tom, I'm standing here at
Boston's Logan Airport,

19
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:51,081
where some of the same
security people

20
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:52,750
who let the terrorists
on the plane

21
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:54,718
are still gainfully employed.

22
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:57,554
With such low fares,
even those who never fly

23
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:00,324
are lining up
to buy tickets.

24
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:01,525
Early reports suggest

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,594
that this could be
the most profitable day

26
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:06,330
for airlines in
the last two decades.

27
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:07,631
I'm Tricia Takanawa.

28
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,766
Back to you, Tom.

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Hi, Mom.

30
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,568
(in Joe's voice):
Hi, Joe.

31
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:13,370
Wow, Peter,
did you hear that?

32
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:14,405
Low airfares.

33
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,806
Why don't we
take a trip?

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,708
We never go
anywhere anymore.

35
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:18,709
We're gettin' stagnant.

36
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:19,710
What are you
talking about?

37
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:20,711
We go places.

38
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:22,846
We took that helicopter
tour of Tucson.

39
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:24,815
Wow. I've never seen
so many boats

40
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,684
not near bodies of water.

41
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:28,819
That park is all concrete.

42
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:31,722
Look, there's a dog
tied to a other dog.

43
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:34,158
I think that guy with
long hair is a lawyer.

44
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:37,628
Look at all those students
running for their lives.

45
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,830
Oh, there's
the concrete park again.

46
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:42,299
Peter, I'm talking
about real travel.

47
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:44,468
We can finally afford
to go somewhere good.

48
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:45,836
Joe and Bonnie
went to Europe

49
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,438
and had the time
of their lives.

50
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,740
Hey, I know a place
you can go, Lois: Hell.

51
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:51,675
There, I said it.
Now shut your mouth.

52
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,077
Lois, I hate travelling.

53
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:55,112
Besides, my passport
picture is awful.

54
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,384
Ugh, you look like
a human cigarette.

55
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:02,119
But it's not just
about you, Peter.

56
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:03,287
Think about the family.

57
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:05,656
It would be an amazing
experience for the kids.

58
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,391
It would give them
some culture.

59
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:09,326
Lois, the kids can get
all the culture they need

60
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:10,561
right here in Quahog.

61
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:11,562
Really?

62
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:12,830
More culture
than Europe?

63
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,698
That's right, and I'm
gonna prove it to you.

64
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,567
I got more culture
in my pinkie toe

65
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:18,002
than all of Europe
put together.

66
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:22,106
(singing opera)

67
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:32,983
(wild applause)

68
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:34,251
Oh, my God!

69
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:37,421
I got ringworm, too,
but it's not classy like this.

70
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,893
Okay, kids, now this is
the Quahog Museum of Science.

71
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:46,497
A magical place
of cultural exploration.

72
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:49,500
♪

73
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:58,776
That sucked.

74
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,346
Now, one thing that
makes us more cultured

75
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,015
than our European counterparts
is high school football.

76
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,251
Then why are we standing here
in the parking lot?

77
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:08,952
Because sometimes
your team loses,

78
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:10,454
and you have to
beat up the ref.

79
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:14,024
What part
of Eatonville you from, huh?

80
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,859
What part of Eatonville
you from?

81
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:17,428
Ow! West Eatonville.

82
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:18,462
Oh, really?
West Eatonville?

83
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:19,763
Do you know Bob Hanley?

84
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:21,598
I'm Bob Hanley.
No kidding!

85
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:23,133
Bob, it's me, Peter Griffin.

86
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:24,968
Oh, my God,
how the hell are you?

87
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,804
I'm doing great.
I'm doing great.

88
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:28,005
Well, hey, oh, listen.

89
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,206
I was really sorry
to hear about your dad.

90
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,641
Oh, that means a lot.

91
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:32,709
Yeah, I'm sorry
I couldn't make it to the wake.

92
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:33,877
I was out of town.

93
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:35,345
It's okay.
Thanks for the flowers.

94
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,780
Oh, it's the least I could do.

95
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:37,915
Hey, Chris, get over here.

96
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:40,217
You got to meet
my buddy Bob Hanley.

97
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:42,453
Hi, Mr. Hanley.
I'm Chris.

98
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:45,556
I heard a lot about you, sir.

99
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,395
We now return
to <i>Downton Syndrome.</i>

100
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:53,730
Well, if I must accept
your proposal in order

101
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:56,200
to break the entail
and save my family's estate,

102
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:58,669
then yes, I will marry you.

103
00:03:58,703 --> 00:04:00,471
Yay!

104
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:03,006
Everyone,
I've got a surprise.

105
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,809
Whoa!
I did not see that coming.

106
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,678
No, Chris,
I haven't said it yet.

107
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:09,847
Today was the last day
of the low airfares,

108
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:13,083
and I couldn't let
the opportunity pass, so...

109
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:15,419
I got us tickets to Italy!

110
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:16,854
That's amazing, Mom!

111
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:18,288
Lois, is Peter
okay with this?

112
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:21,358
Well, Brian, I haven't
quite told him yet.

113
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:22,659
But what if he says no?

114
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:24,228
He can't say no.

115
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:25,696
I already
bought the tickets.

116
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,697
Tickets for what?

117
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:27,764
Uh, uh...

118
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:30,300
tickets for the, um,
the grand opening

119
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,470
of the biggest water park
in all of Rhode Island.

120
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:35,339
Hmm, well, pardon
my skepticism, Lois,

121
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:37,407
but I didn't read
about this in the latest issue

122
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:39,510
of <i>Water Park Enthusiast Weekly.</i>

123
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:42,880
Well, they-they had
to, um, keep it secret.

124
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:45,415
For fear that, um...

125
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,917
th-that this new park would put

126
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:49,153
all other water parks
out of business.

127
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:50,454
Typical Big Water.

128
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,156
Always keeping the
public in the dark.

129
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,391
So this one's bigger
than Raging Waters?

130
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:56,126
Yeah, Dad.
It's way bigger.

131
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,327
How does the boy know?

132
00:04:57,362 --> 00:04:58,662
Uh, because I-I told him.

133
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:00,864
I-I know someone who-who helped,
uh, build it.

134
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:03,200
Wow, so we really got an
inside track on this thing.

135
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,235
But it can't be bigger
than Six Flags Atlantis.

136
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,337
Oh, it is, Peter, it is.

137
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,539
Because...

138
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:11,408
it's Seven Flags Atlantis.

139
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:14,011
(gasps) That's a whole flag
more of water!

140
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,212
Get in the car!

141
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:17,381
Okay, everyone,
put the sunblock on now,

142
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,416
so when we get off the plane,
we go right to the park.

143
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,151
Wait, why are we on a plane?

144
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,587
Uh, you-you want to beat the
lines, don't you, Peter?

145
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:24,888
All-all right, Brian, enough.

146
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:27,057
I-I can't
do this anymore.

147
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:29,426
Peter, we're not
going to a water park.

148
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,061
We're going to Italy.

149
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,630
What?! But what about
Seven Flags Atlantis?

150
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:35,032
Peter, don't be silly.

151
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,900
Th-There's no such place.

152
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:38,268
(over P.A.):
This is your captain speaking.

153
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:40,370
If you look out the left side
of the airplane,

154
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:43,106
you'll see the very popular
Seven Flags Atlantis.

155
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,942
Aw!

156
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:48,378
(children laughing)

157
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,380
I'm gonna go ahead
and turn off the seatbelt sign,

158
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:54,184
so you idiots can all stretch
and let the fart festival begin.

159
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:55,886
Why are you such
a dick, Jim?

160
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,355
I'm just mad
about pilot stuff.

161
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:06,082
I can't believe you tricked
me into going to Italy.

162
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,418
Peter, our family could use
a trip like this.

163
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,054
Plus, it might be good
for you and me, too.

164
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:14,190
It's the most romantic country
in the whole world.

165
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:16,693
And God knows we could use a
little romance in our marriage.

166
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:17,961
What are you talking about?

167
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:20,063
Just the other night
we did that role-playing.

168
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:23,500
Did you like that game of
mysterious intruder, Lois?

169
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:25,302
I told you--
I don't know who you are.

170
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:27,103
And my name isn't Lois.

171
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:28,505
Mine is.

172
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,440
Let's do it again.

173
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,549
Is it true there's
no drinking age here?

174
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,318
And they serve wine
at every meal?

175
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:44,054
Oh, Meg, nobody
likes a drunky-chunky.

176
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:47,357
In college, a lot of guys
are gonna make you a dare.

177
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:50,927
Hey, you know what, guys?
We're six hours ahead here.

178
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:52,762
I'm gonna call Joe
and tell him the future.

179
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:54,397
(buttons beeping)

180
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:56,666
Hey, Joe, guess
what's about to happen?

181
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:57,734
Who is this?

182
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:58,735
It's Peter.

183
00:06:58,769 --> 00:06:59,769
That's impossible.

184
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:01,604
Peter died six hours ago.

185
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,639
(gasps)

186
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:03,773
We can't go back.

187
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:15,151
Look, kids,
this is the Forum,

188
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:16,686
where the ancient Romans
used to have

189
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:18,488
their famous
political debates.

190
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,224
And this is the <i>Penthouse</i> Forum,
where dirtbags write letters

191
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:23,326
about boning in the
back of grocery stores.

192
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,441
Well, who wants to see where
the ancients established

193
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,897
the foundation of
our American democracy?

194
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:30,133
And who wants to hear
a story about a girl

195
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,927
who moved to New York
without any underpants?

196
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,571
I don't know
why we even go places.

197
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:36,806
We always just end up
reading pornography.

198
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:42,979
We now return
to <i>Italian Star Trek.</i>

199
00:07:43,013 --> 00:07:45,181
I know I supposed
to be-a so logical,

200
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:48,284
but I get-a so steaming a-mad!

201
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,521
Peter, the kids are going
to the Italian circus,

202
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,890
so I thought
it might be romantic

203
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:56,192
if we watched the sunset
from St. Peter's Basilica.

204
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,267
You go ahead, I'm gonna stay
here and get frustrated

205
00:07:58,295 --> 00:08:01,231
with this nonresponsive
hotel TV remote.

206
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:03,500
Come on! Guide!

207
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,535
I'm pressing "Guide"!

208
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:10,140
Stupid remote's
not doing anything!

209
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,312
Stop what you're doing!

210
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,281
Peter, you can't just
sit in front of the TV

211
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,616
the entire vacation.

212
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,184
You know, I'm really getting
tired of you being

213
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:22,952
such a complete
stick-in-the-mud.

214
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:24,554
Is that some kind
of gay slur?

215
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,189
I can't believe it's
too much for you

216
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:27,624
to watch a sunset
with your wife

217
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:29,692
in one of the most romantic
cities in the world!

218
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:30,827
But, you know what?

219
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,061
It's probably for the best.

220
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,897
Because you'd just
complain about it!

221
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,532
Well, what do you expect, Lois?
I didn't want to come here

222
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:37,801
he first place.
I'd rather be back home.

223
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:40,403
You know, I could be
riding seesaw with Joe.

224
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,439
Yay!

225
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,842
Well, I guess we're stuck.

226
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:48,211
Hang on.
Let me empty this bag.

227
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:50,480
Yay, gross.

228
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:52,415
Fine, you just sit
here on the couch.

229
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,552
I'll go enjoy
Italy without you!

230
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,122
God, what the hell's
her problem?

231
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,557
You know, sometimes
I think you forget

232
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:01,958
how lucky you
are to have Lois.

233
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:04,561
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
acting like such a jerk.

234
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:06,129
Oh, I'm getting it
from you now?

235
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:07,297
Don't worry about Lois.

236
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:08,932
She's an American woman
in Italy.

237
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,500
She'll go out,
kill her roommate

238
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:12,469
during a sex game,
and then she'll be fine.

239
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:14,170
She might come back
even hotter.

240
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:15,905
Well, you might want
to look out there.

241
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,077
What the hell's she doing

00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:52,535
I was watching you
from the window.

00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:34,771
Okay, I'll admit it--
this is pretty romantic.

318
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:36,372
Listen, Lois.

319
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,608
I'm sorry for being
such a jerk, all right?

320
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:40,376
I love you.

321
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,847
I want to have your baby.

322
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:47,517
Peter, not on a boat.

323
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:48,885
Peter...

324
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,586
Oh, Peter...

325
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,422
Come on, Lois, I got
a ninety-percenter going.

326
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,757
It could go either way.
Let's start making choices.

327
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,693
Oh, Peter...

328
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,661
I love you.

329
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,997
I love you, too.

330
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,875
Wow, Peter, last night was
the best sex I've ever had.

331
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,844
Me, too.

332
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,679
We haven't done it like that
since we were engaged

333
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:19,849
but allowed to sleep
with other people.

334
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,518
The point is, Italy is the best
thing that ever happened to us.

335
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,587
I know, it's been
wonderful.

336
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,322
I wish we never
had to leave.

337
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:28,791
Well, then, let's not.
Let's live here.

338
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:30,460
What? Peter, but...

339
00:13:30,494 --> 00:13:32,929
but we've built a life
back in Quahog.

340
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,297
Yeah, but you
were right, Lois,

341
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:35,998
we were stagnating
back home.

342
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,334
Let's start a new life,
right here in Italy.

343
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,639
Peter, those were our passports!

344
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:44,807
We don't need them anymore.

345
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:46,943
Kids, I got an announcement.

346
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:48,377
He's wearing
a rubber.

347
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,813
We're staying in Italy.
We're Italian now.

348
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:52,148
What?!
Are you kidding?!

349
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,483
Well, if we're
going to be Italian,

350
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:55,718
I guess we should start
murdering our brothers.

351
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:58,554
What are you...?
(gagging)

352
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,389
You break-a
my heart, Chris.

353
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,858
You break-a my heart.

354
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,659
("Funiculi Funicula" plays)

355
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:12,726
(bicycle bell dings)

356
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:14,962
Hey, Peter,
what's-a you rush?

357
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:17,565
I got-a the most beautiful woman
in the world at home,

358
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,400
and I no wanna keep her waiting.

359
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:22,069
Hey, Vincenzo,
play me a tune, huh?

360
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:24,472
(playing "Yankee Doodle Dandy")

361
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:27,741
Oh, Vincenzo!

("Funiculi Funicula" resumes)

363
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:32,546
Ah, Italy.

364
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,914
It 9:00 a.m.

365
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:36,016
and I've already kissed
eight guys twice.

366
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:37,952
Why-a you looking
at other babies, huh?

367
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:40,054
Why you make-a me
do that, Ruperto?

368
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,222
I no wanna do that!

369
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,556
Peter, I know you
love it here,

370
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:43,991
but riding your
bike around town

371
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,159
isn't paying the bills,

372
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:46,861
and the kids aren't
learning anything

373
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:48,629
at that Italian school.

374
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:50,464
Look at these
big ones, huh?

375
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:51,799
Rut-ta-ta ta-ta,

376
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,535
rut-ta-ta ta-ta,
rut-ta-ta ta-ta!

377
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:55,803
Is this calculus?

378
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:56,971
I don't know.

379
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:59,140
Rut-ta-ta ta-ta!

380
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:00,407
I think maybe it's time

381
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,643
to go back to our
real home in Quahog.

382
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:04,245
But I thought
you loved Italy.

383
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,646
And Italian Peter.

384
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,248
And Southern
Italian Peter.

385
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,883
Olive oil!

386
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,819
I do, but I love
American Peter even more.

387
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:12,987
Lois is right.

388
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:14,355
We're barely
surviving here.

389
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:15,890
I mean, you have to give
most of what you earn

390
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:18,626
to the mafia that
terrorizes this village.

391
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,661
(tires screeching)

392
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,164
Peter, I think it's time
we all go back home.

393
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,599
(sighs):
Of course we have to leave

394
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:00,701
as soon as I get
an Italian boyfriend.

395
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:01,769
You know, I still
don't understand

396
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:03,070
what he does for a living.

397
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:05,439
He gathers coins from the air
by jumping on mushrooms.

398
00:16:05,473 --> 00:16:07,241
What's so hard to understand?!

399
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:08,609
("Super Mario Bros."
music plays)

400
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,344
Hey, Meg, let's go-a
two-player!

401
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:12,012
I got-a Luigi
here, huh?

402
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:13,080
Hey, Meg-a!

403
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:16,250
Mario said-a you were
into-a weird-a stuff.

404
00:16:19,654 --> 00:16:21,088
So, you see, Mr. Consulate,

405
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:23,290
all we want to do is get back
to our home in America.

406
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:25,459
So, can we have
our new passports now?

407
00:16:25,493 --> 00:16:27,361
Mr. Griffin, it's not
as simple as that.

408
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:29,463
Your family must take
a citizenship test

409
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:30,998
and go through
the immigration process

410
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,666
like any other
foreigner.

411
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,768
Foreigner?
We're not foreigners.

412
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:35,803
Sorry, Mrs. Griffin.

413
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:37,571
Not only did you
destroy your passports,

414
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:39,506
you renounced our citizenship.

415
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,641
When did we do that?

416
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:41,709
Oh, I did that

417
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:43,177
on the Italian social
networking site,

418
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,812
"Shut-up-a-you-facebook."

419
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:56,890
All right, Meg, part of
being an American citizen

420
00:16:56,925 --> 00:17:00,160
is having an opinion on certain
hot-button political issues.

421
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,529
Now, what is your
abortion stance?

422
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,165
It's pretty much this.

423
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:08,502
Now, if you will,
please sing

424
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:10,938
the national anthem
of the United States.

Okay, I've reviewed
your application.

435
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:40,868
Now, where
you listed employment,

436
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:42,503
some of you wrote "Family Guy,"

437
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:44,371
and others wrote
"The Family Guy."

438
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:45,472
Which one is it?

439
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:48,676
(sighs):
It's "Family Guy."

440
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,943
All right,
now that you've completed

441
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:51,111
your initial application,

442
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:53,066
it will need to be filed
by an immigration lawyer

443
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:56,083
at a cost of approximately
$5,000 per person.

444
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,818
And assuming
that all goes through,

445
00:17:57,852 --> 00:18:00,988
you should have your
citizenship back in 16 months.

446
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,323
Sixteen months?

447
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:03,791
If I didn't know any better,

448
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:05,059
I'd think you were making it

449
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:06,860
hard to become
a citizen on purpose.

450
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:09,663
Like you don't want any
immigrants coming to the U.S.

451
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:11,098
I wish that were true,
Mrs. Griffin,

452
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:12,700
and it probably might be.

453
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:15,536
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go sit on my fat wife.

454
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,739
WOMAN: I'm ready for you,
String Bean!

455
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:20,507
What a weird guy.

456
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:21,909
Oh, this is terrible.

457
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,677
Peter, what are
we going to do?

458
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:25,212
I'll tell you what
we're going to do.

459
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:26,480
We're going
to sneak in.

460
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:28,182
Well, we better get there soon.

461
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:31,418
I want to be there for opening
night of <i>Karate Kid 5.</i>

462
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:33,253
Mr. Miyagi, this is
kind of embarrassing,

463
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:36,223
but I'm having a problem
with erectile dysfunction.

464
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:38,425
Aye, Daniel-san.
Miyagi fix.

465
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:48,535
(horn honks)

466
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:14,094
(crane whirring)

467
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,761
(clearing throat)

468
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:54,001
Well, I'm so glad to finally
be back home in Quahog.

469
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:55,436
Although,
I will miss Italy.

470
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,072
You made the trip very
special for me, Peter.

471
00:19:59,107 --> 00:20:01,008
Well, thanks for showing
me and the kids

472
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,776
what the rest of
the world is like, Lois.

473
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:04,711
I think we all learned a lot.

474
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,246
And we met a lot
of great people.

475
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:08,449
Hey, what about that

00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:09,483
Did you get their number?

477
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:10,517
I did. You ready?
Yup.

478
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:14,621
Okay, it's

482
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:25,032

483
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:26,500
(pounding at door)

484
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:29,636
Mario! You came for me!

485
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,538
Come with me, Meg,
my princess.

486
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:34,741
We gonna take this relationship
to the next level.

487
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,777
(game music playing)

488
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:42,645
MEG:
Luigi's here again?

489
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:44,399
I thought that was
a one-time thing.

490
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,518

LUIGI:

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,488
We-a not-a high class people.

493
