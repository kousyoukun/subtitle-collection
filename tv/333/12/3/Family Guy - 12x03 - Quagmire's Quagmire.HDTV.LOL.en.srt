12
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:37,967
Hey, thanks for helping me pick
out a new computer, you guys.

13
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:39,268
Oh, no problem,
Quagmire.

14
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:40,970
God, this place is
always so crowded.

15
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:42,572
We gotta find someone
who works here.

16
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:43,840
Can I help you, sir?

17
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:46,342
Sorry, all I got
is a quarter, pal.

18
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:47,977
Oh, excuse me, sir.

19
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:49,979
My buddy here is
looking for a computer.

20
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,914
I would like to elect you
president.

21
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:55,118
What are you doing?

22
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:57,120
You gonna get a new phone
while we're here?

23
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:58,654
Maybe. But I gotta see
which one

24
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:01,257
I wanna take in and out of
my pocket every 30 seconds

25
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,492
for the next six years.

26
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:03,766
What do you think,
Peter? Peter?

27
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:06,929
I touched a iPhone headphone.

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,933
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go with this one.

29
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:13,102
Guy said it's the newest version.
Just came out this week.

30
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:14,103
Ah, good call,
Quagmire.

31
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:15,505
You're gonna be like
the first guy

32
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:17,106
in the neighborhood
to own a Model T.

33
00:01:19,476 --> 00:01:21,077
See ya, suckers!

34
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:24,847
I'll be there an hour after you
with throw-up all over my legs!

35
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:30,219
Are you getting excited
for Halloween, Stewie?

36
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:32,121
You know, we'll have
to start thinking

37
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:33,489
about your costume soon.

38
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:34,957
All right, but let's make sure

39
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:36,692
we don't cover up this,
all right?

40
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:38,628
It's what puts candy in the bag.

41
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:40,430
Oh, look, Chris,
here's your costume

42
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:42,465
from the year you went
as a condom.

43
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:45,134
What the hell are you
supposed to be?

44
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:48,337
Oh, Stewie, look!

45
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:50,773
It's your very
first teddy bear!

46
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,177
Oscar?

47
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:56,012
Wow, I remember
that bear.

48
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,980
That's the one Grandma
and Grandpa brought Stewie

49
00:01:58,015 --> 00:01:59,882
when he was still
in the hospital.

50
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,717
Oh, and here's the card
they sent me.

51
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:06,422
"Three kids on $40,000?
Have fun with your crap life."

52
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:08,257
I guess he got tucked
away up here.

53
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,826
You want him back,
sweetie?

54
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:14,430
What, this old thing?

55
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:15,698
No, no, thank you.
I've grown.

56
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:16,732
I've changed.

57
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,201
You sure you
don't want him?

58
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,368
I said no, okay?

59
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:20,736
Don't you have
a wedding dress

60
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:22,738
to try halfway on
and then cry about?

61
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:29,345
Hello? Oh, hey, Quagmire.
What's up?

62
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,681
Hey, Peter, I need
some help with my computer.

63
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:32,949
I can't find my photos.

64
00:02:32,983 --> 00:02:34,217
Did you look
under "Photos"?

65
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:35,351
What is that?

66
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:36,652
It's a folder
called "Photos."

67
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:37,920
Yeah, I-I don't have that.

68
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:39,956
I just have 40 folders
all called "New Folder."

69
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,991
Okay. You know what?
Click on your hard drive.

70
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:43,593
Okay, now-now the arrow
on the screen,

71
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:44,894
that's me, right?

72
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:46,762
Yeah, yeah, that's you.
Okay, now-now just...

73
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:48,798
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
There's a calculator on this thing?!

74
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:51,000
Listen, Quagmire,
what are you trying to do?

75
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:51,929
I just wanna put pictures
of my cat

76
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,355
on everyone's
Internet computer.

77
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:54,556
Like, how do I do that?

78
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,772
Okay, wait. There's an agreement
that just popped up.

79
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,441
Hang on. L-Let me read
the whole thing.

80
00:02:58,475 --> 00:02:59,642
Just hit "Accept."

81
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:01,477
Well, that seems a little foolhardy,
doesn't it, Peter?

82
00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:03,145
Look, do we have
to do this now?

83
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,146
I'm watching something.

84
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,147
I know. I'm sorry.

85
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:06,516
I-I'm just nervous
that somebody else

86
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,651
is gonna get pictures
of their cat on the Internet first,

87
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,620
and then I'll always be known
as the second guy

88
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:12,488
to get pictures of his cat
on the Internet.

89
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:14,390
Quagmire, I don't know
how to tell you this,

90
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:15,925
but there's already
cats on the Internet.

91
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,460
Wait, it's-it's giving me
that pinwheel thing.

92
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:20,263
It-It's frozen. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, it crashed!

93
00:03:20,297 --> 00:03:21,731
The whole thing
just crashed!

94
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:22,832
Geez, Quagmire,
calm down.

95
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:23,933
We'll figure it out.

96
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,468
No, Peter,
the whole thing's fried!

97
00:03:25,502 --> 00:03:26,569
I can't even...!

98
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:28,271
Ah! damn it!
What the hell?!

99
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:30,139
Hey, you clicked "Accept."

100
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:35,244
Hey, what's going on?

101
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,746
You doing some
reading there?

102
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,548
Yes, well, you know
I turn to poetry

103
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:40,449
when matters of the heart
weigh heavily on me.

104
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,184
"If you're happy
and you know it,

105
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:45,655
"then your face will
surely show it.

106
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:47,723
"If you're happy
and you know it,

107
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:49,325
"clap your hands.

108
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,326
Anonymous."

109
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,627
Wait-- matters
of the heart?

110
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:53,029
What are you
talking about?

111
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:55,731
Well, Lois found my old teddy
bear, Oscar, in the attic.

112
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,967
And I'm just not sure how
to handle it,

113
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:59,602
what with Rupert and all.

114
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,203
Who cares?
Just play with them both.

115
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:02,438
I can't do that!

116
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:04,073
Oh, it would be
so awkward!

117
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:05,441
Um... okay.

118
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:06,776
Oscar was my...

119
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,511
well, he was my first,
you know.

120
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:09,946
And that's always exciting.

121
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,081
But-but I've been
with Rupert for so long now.

122
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:13,082
Uh-huh.

123
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:14,617
Most of our finances
are intertwined.

124
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,052
We've built
a life together.

125
00:04:16,086 --> 00:04:17,887
On the other hand,
Oscar...

126
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:20,189
Oscar's the only one who can
really make me laugh.

127
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:23,693
I hate to say it, but I'm mostly
with Rupert because of his insurance.

128
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:25,328
Stewie, I think you're
overthinking this.

129
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:26,963
No, you're right.
You're right, Brian.

130
00:04:26,997 --> 00:04:28,030
I'm with Rupert now.

131
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:29,765
I just need
to forget Oscar.

132
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,134
No matter how intense
our relationship was.

133
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:37,940
That's amazing.

134
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,909
It's like you took
all the colors that exist

135
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:43,145
and said, ",
here's a new one."

136
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:48,918
Hi, can I help you?

137
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:49,919
Well, that depends.

138
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:51,621
Do you know how
to fix pieces of junk?!

139
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:53,122
Haven't been stumped yet.

140
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:58,160
Okay, I see what
your problem is.

141
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:00,329
I-I-I tried to buy
a sweater online,

142
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,198
and I-I think
I got a virus.

143
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:04,600
No, the porn's
not the problem.

144
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:06,102
Your browser history shows

145
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:07,937
that you've been going
to kinkylatinas.net.

146
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:10,206
But that site has
a bunch of malware.

147
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,407
Oh.

148
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:12,842
Personally, I'd recommend
College Latinas.

149
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:15,678
I mean, I wanna see Latinas,
but I also want them to

150
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:17,680
Speak English. speak English.
Yes, exactly.

151
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:20,516
Wow. So you're into that kind
of stuff, too?

152
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,385
Uh-huh.

153
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:26,122
Would you, uh, would you have
dinner with me?

154
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:27,890
Absolutely.

155
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:30,359
Excuse me. I bought this
laptop here yesterday,

156
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:33,229
but when I got home I noticed
the apple already had

157
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:35,831
a bite taken out of it!

158
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:42,571
So, yeah, I was
the first woman

159
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:44,640
to ride her bike
cross-country with no seat.

160
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:46,008
Gosh, that's neat, Sonja.

161
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:47,376
And-and where'd
you go to college?

162
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:49,478
I think Syracuse,
but I don't know.

163
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:52,148
My face was buried
in a pillow all four years.

164
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:54,550
Wow, sounds like you took
a full class load.

165
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:59,388
Oh, Glenn, I'm so glad
you asked me out.

166
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,990
Whenever I talk
about stuff like this,

167
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:02,425
most people look at me

168
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,160
like I'm some kind
of disgusting perv.

169
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:05,394
Me, too, but who cares?

170
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,263
You should never be afraid
to be different.

171
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:08,264
Hoo.

172
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:09,265
Hoo.

173
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:11,767
Whom.

174
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:17,039
Morning.

175
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:19,875
Morning.

176
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,078
We kind of had
a crazy night.

177
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:23,512
Yeah, we... Did we?

178
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:24,714
I don't really remember,

179
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:27,483
but I do feel like I might
be down a couple of quarts.

180
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:31,220
Well, even though you seemed
like a sure thing,

181
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:33,923
I really wanted
to make sure.

182
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,893
Oh, my God!
You roofied me?!

183
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:39,095
Are you mad?

184
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:42,732
No. I'm in love!

185
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,202
Sonja, honey,
stay right here.

186
00:06:46,236 --> 00:06:48,070
I just have to go
to the bathroom.

187
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:49,205
Wait, Glenn.

188
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:52,241
Take this wine glass.
We can use it later.

189
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:54,176
My God, I...

190
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:56,045
I've never been so happy!

191
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:03,136
I'm telling you guys,
Sonja is the perfect woman.

192
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:05,739
She's every bit as kinky
and as insatiable as I am.

193
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:06,340
Really?

194
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:08,341
I thought you said she was
just some computer geek.

195
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:09,609
She is.

196
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:12,746
Her mouth has enough storage
space for a giggity-byte. Oh!

197
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,049
Geez, you changed your
relationship status already?

198
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,617
When you know, you know.

199
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,419
All right, but just
be careful, ya know?

200
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:21,021
You don't wanna rush an
important decision.

201
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:22,422
I'll take
the cheeseburger meal.

202
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:24,524
Would you like to make it
an extra large meal?

203
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:27,094
Uh...

204
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,920
N-No. Yes.

205
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:55,088
No.

206
00:07:55,123 --> 00:07:57,424
You sure? It's only
29 cents more.

207
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,658
Yes.

208
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:00,427
No.

209
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,833
What the hell?

210
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,904
Stewie, what are you doing
up here?

211
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,706
Brian!

212
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,907
It's not what you think!

213
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:15,876
All right, I came up here
for a photo shoot

214
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,844
and it just got way,
way out of hand!

215
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,979
You're having tea.

216
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:20,514
How is that
out of hand?

217
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:21,982
Is your shirt
on backwards?

218
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:24,618
Please! You can't tell Rupert
I was up here, all right?

219
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:26,319
He wouldn't understand.
He'll kill himself, Brian!

220
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:27,754
He's been through so much
already!

221
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,523
He can't take much more!

222
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:31,725
Brian, he watched
his brother drown!

223
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,959
Stewie, relax.

224
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,928
You're getting all
worked up over nothing.

225
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:36,563
Says the guy who freaks out

226
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:38,565
every time
a fire engine goes by.

227
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:41,601
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

228
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:46,740
Peter, Peter, you hear that?!

229
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:50,877
I'm matching the sound!

230
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:52,846
Is what I'm doing helping?

231
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,785
Glenn, why did you
bring me here?

232
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,020
Well, I've always had
this fantasy

233
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:01,555
of having sex on
the basketball court

234
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,056
in front of my
high school principal.

235
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,227
Only problem is he's
now completely senile.

236
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:09,763
Yeah, you like this,
Principal Goodrich, huh?

237
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:10,997
Remember you once
suspended me

238
00:09:11,032 --> 00:09:12,532
for showing my wiener
in school?

239
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,900
I did?

240
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:16,269
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

241
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:18,205
I'm sorry, Sonja,
I don't think I can finish.

242
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,273
You never could finish,
Quagmire!

243
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:22,375
Donahue, get in there!

244
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:26,813
Okay, Glenn, now that we've
covered ourselves in black ink,

245
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:28,448
let's do it until
we've created

246
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:31,518
every character in
the Chinese alphabet.

247
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:43,296
When all said and done,

248
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:46,399
Quagmire body tell story
of sadness.

249
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:52,138
Wow, I can't even imagine
what twisted deviant act

250
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:53,773
you've thought of this time.

251
00:09:53,808 --> 00:09:56,343
I want you to have sex
with your father.

252
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:57,844
What?!

253
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,579
Yep, and I'm gonna watch.

254
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:00,747
Hi, Glenn.

255
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,816
Are you crazy?! No!
No way!

256
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,418
Glenn, remember, the thing we love
most about each other

257
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:07,087
is that we push
each other

258
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:10,523
way beyond
our normal boundaries.

259
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:12,859
Did you enjoy your stay
at the Marriott?

260
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:14,694
No, I did not.

261
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:21,534
Oh, well, excuse me for not
being six months old anymore!

262
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,470
Oh, and here come
the tears!

263
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:26,206
The show is starting,
everyone! Come on down!

264
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:29,542
What's all that noise?

265
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:31,044
What the hell's
going on up there?

266
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:32,579
We're in a fight is
what's going on!

267
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:34,681
Brian, I need you to settle
an argument for us:

268
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:35,882
am I Hitler?

269
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,384
Because I don't think
that I am,

270
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:40,287
but maybe-maybe
I'm off base on this.

271
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,421
Stewie, take it easy.

272
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:42,455
No, you know what?

273
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,890
You may as well call
your family now

274
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:45,158
because I'm not going
to Sarasota.

275
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:46,893
I don't care
if we can't get a refund,

276
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:47,961
we're through!

277
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,095
Here, Brian, you take him.

278
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,363
Maybe you can make him happy.

279
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:51,665
What?
You heard me. Take him.

280
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,433
Do whatever you want
with him, I don't care.

281
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,701
Rupert and I are over!

282
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:55,769
Are you sure?

283
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:56,870
Yes, we're done.

284
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:58,338
I just hope we can
handle it better

285
00:10:58,372 --> 00:11:00,307
than blue and yellow
did when they split up.

286
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:02,242
You were supposed to have
the kids here by 5:00.

287
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,343
We have plans.

288
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:04,477
It's 5:15.

289
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:05,946
Stop busting my hump, Alicia.

290
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,213
Okay, you know
what, let's not...

291
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:08,715
let's not do this
in front of the kids.

292
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:09,983
God, you're right.

293
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:11,217
What ever happened to us?

294
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,053
Hey, baby, you
ready for dinner?

295
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:14,220
What's up, Scott?

296
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:16,222
We gonna get
some barbecue.

297
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:20,593
Hey, guys.

298
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:22,362
No, indoors, not okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

299
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:23,830
Don't do it.
Nighttime, not allowed.

300
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:25,198
What? There's nothing
wrong with this.

301
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:27,100
No, no way, give me those.

302
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:29,703
Oh, my God.

303
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:31,104
Quagmire,
what the hell happened?

304
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,872
Is this another one
of those sex-related injuries

305
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:34,040
you keep getting?

306
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:35,375
Yeah, it seems like lately

307
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,844
that girlfriend of yours is
taking things a little too far.

308
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:39,946
No, she's not;
everything's great with us.

309
00:12:02,503 --> 00:12:04,371
Are you guys still talking
about Sonja?

310
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:05,739
All right, I should
probably get going.

311
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:06,973
Sonja and I are supposed to go

312
00:12:06,974 --> 00:12:09,642
to a "Brown Eyes
Wide Shut" party.

313
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:11,678
Geez, I don't know what's
going on with him.

314
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:13,747
But I guess love does
funny things to people.

315
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:15,115
Look at Forrest Gump.

316
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,383
Hi, Forrest.

317
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:19,019
I know you just got back
from Vietnam and you love me,

318
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:20,787
but I'm gonna go run a train

319
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:22,789
with this group
of Black Panthers I just met.

320
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:24,791
Okay, Jenny.

321
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:26,126
Hi, Forrest.

322
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,495
I know you came all this way
to New York to visit me,

323
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:29,662
but I'm gonna go do blow

324
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:31,498
and have sex
with a bunch of stockbrokers.

325
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:33,466
Okay, Jenny.

326
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:34,634
Hi, Forrest.

327
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:36,202
Now that I have
the most contagious

328
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:38,204
and incurable disease
known to mankind,

329
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,140
I'll finally have pity sex
with you.

330
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:41,975
Okay, Jenny.

331
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:45,345
And I'll mow the grass
and raise the AIDS baby.

332
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:49,682
Hey, sexy.

333
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:52,018
Sonja, what are you doing here?

334
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:54,654
Well, I got tired of waiting
for you to get home,

335
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,756
so I thought I'd come to you.

336
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,991
Come on, Sonja. How about...

337
00:12:58,025 --> 00:12:59,459
how about
we take a night off, huh?

338
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,894
The sex has just been nonstop.

339
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:03,596
I mean, I understand
that "no" doesn't mean "no,"

340
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:05,999
but certainly some word
has got to mean "no."

341
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:11,137
This is one of your
fantasies, right?

342
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,306
Public humiliation?

343
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,942
Mm, it's sexy, isn't it?

344
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:19,813
Sonja, stop, please!

345
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:22,282
Come on, you love it.

346
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:28,021
Ow! Ow! Ow!

347
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:30,557
You're hurting me, and I really
need to clean out my trunk!

348
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:32,358
Oh, I'm gonna clean
out your trunk.

349
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,560
Giggity.

350
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:34,694
That's my word.

351
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:36,096
That's my word!

352
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:43,536
Okay, Joe, Joe,
you're drunk, okay?

353
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,572
You're drunk;
give me your keys.

354
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:47,941
And-and I'm drunk,
so I'll give you my keys.

355
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:51,077
Okay, now we're both good
to drive home.

356
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:56,950
You been drinking tonight, sir?

357
00:13:56,984 --> 00:14:00,720
Uh, no, Officer, I just had
a glass of dinner with my wine.

358
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:02,989
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car

359
00:14:03,023 --> 00:14:05,325
and walk a straight
line, please.

360
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:07,727
All right, you be safe, sir.

361
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,863
There's a lot of crazies
out there tonight.

362
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,600
Oh, hey, Mr. and
Mrs. Quagmire.

363
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:20,701
Hi, Peter.

364
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,103
I'm a little worried
about Glenn.

365
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:23,771
I haven't heard
from him in days.

366
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:24,939
Have you seen him?

367
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:26,107
I haven't seen anybody.

368
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,909
I've been grounded
for pinching a girl.

369
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:30,044
Hey, are you guys talking
about Quagmire?

370
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,646
He never showed
this morning,

371
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,348
and today's the day
we usually go apple picking.

372
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:35,783
Get that one.

373
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:36,951
Get that one!

374
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:38,286
Hey, get that one.

375
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,620
Get that one over there.

376
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:41,355
No, not-not that one.

377
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,957
I already got it!
I can't put it back!

378
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:44,392
Well, it's not
going in the pie.

379
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,127
Well, if you're so smart,
why don't you come up here

380
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:47,328
and pick them yourself?

381
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:49,463
And now there's
no pie at all.

382
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:50,965
I've already checked
Glenn's house,

383
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:52,633
and there's no sign
he's even been there.

384
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:54,535
I'm afraid something terrible
has happened.

385
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:56,337
Now let's not jump
to any conclusions.

386
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:58,239
I'm sure if we just check
his usual hangouts,

387
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,840
someone will have seen him.

388
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,975
Wait a second.

389
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,044
He hangs out at the Clam
with some fat loudmouth.

390
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:05,479
You find Loudy McFatass,
you find Quagmire.

391
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:06,714
Come on, let's go.

392
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:08,816
But Dad, it's the
night of my big show.

393
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,486
Oh, Chris, I was never
gonna go to that.

394
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,758
We should get some food
in you, mister.

395
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,593
You hardly ate
any of that cereal

396
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,028
I smashed
on your mouth yesterday.

397
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:22,563
Brian?

398
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:24,365
Oh, hey.

399
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,800
What the hell are you doing?

400
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:28,269
Oh, I've been kind of using
Rupert as a chew toy.

401
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,704
Chewing him
with your crotch?

402
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:31,405
Hey, dogs like humping
stuffed animals.

403
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,506
What can I say?

404
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,075
Besides, you said
I could have Rupert.

405
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:35,743
I thought you liked
Oscar better anyway.

406
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:37,244
Well, I just changed my mind.

407
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,814
And you know Rupert's a dude,
right, you gaylord?

408
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:45,086
Okay, you guys, where should
we start looking for Glenn?

409
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,988
Well, sometimes Quagmire
likes to hang out

410
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:48,789
under all the clutter
in my garage.

411
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,992
So, why don't we
just start sorting stuff

412
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:52,526
and throwing stuff away

413
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:53,828
but obviously checking
with me first

414
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:55,062
before you throw stuff away.

415
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:56,430
No problem, Peter.

416
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:58,799
Quagmire, if you're in
there, hang tight, buddy.

417
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,034
We're coming.

418
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:01,802
Right, and if we can't
find him in here,

419
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,170
he sometimes likes to hang out

420
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:05,039
in between the blades
of grass in my lawn.

421
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:07,541
And also, in the firewood
that needs to be split.

422
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:09,543
Might he be under the leaves
in your gutter?

423
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:10,911
Great question,
and yes, he might.

424
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:12,780
So, while you guys
are taking care of that,

425
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:14,682
I'll be around back
flicking pinecones

426
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,550
at a tree
with this hockey stick.

427
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:23,124
Aloha.
Welcome to Ryan's Hawaiians.

428
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:24,525
Hey, how you doing?

429
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,593
Amazing.

430
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:26,994
Have you seen this man?

431
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,329
Glenn Quagmire?

432
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,831
Nah, the last time I saw him
was three months ago.

433
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,700
Sold him 70 red shirts.

434
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,602
Yeah, he does look
good in that shirt.

435
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:36,737
Uh, everyone looks good
in my shirts.

436
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:38,139
How about you, Big Island?

437
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:39,507
Uh, I don't know.

438
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,175
Do you want to be
an oldies' DJ

439
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,877
or a 1980's wrestling manager?

440
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:44,412
Yes, both.

441
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:46,781
This is beautiful.

442
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:48,449
Heart disease looks better

443
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:50,918
when it's wrapped in a
tropical, floral pattern.

444
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:55,790
Oh, my God, this is hopeless.

445
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:57,658
We've been searching for hours.

446
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,260
Glenn could be dead by now.

447
00:16:59,294 --> 00:17:01,128
I know, and if you guys
are really hungry,

448
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:02,263
I suppose I could eat.

449
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:03,497
Come on, we can't give up.

450
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:05,299
Someone's got to
have seen Quagmire.

451
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,901
Or if not him,
at least Sonja.

452
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,903
Excuse me, did you
just say "Sonja"?

453
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:10,037
Yes! I did!

454
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,372
That was my dog's name.

455
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,674
Excuse me,
did he just say "Sonja"?

456
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,942
Yeah, it was his dog's name.

457
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:16,944
Oh, I thought
he might have been talking

458
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:19,018
about this super kinky woman
who's always down here,

459
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:21,048
trying to lure men
to her sex slave shed.

460
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,950
No, I think he was talking
about his dog.

461
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:25,219
No, Peter, that's the
Sonja we're looking for.

462
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,221
Sonja must have
taken Glenn there.

463
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,889
Where exactly is
this sex slave shed?

464
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,091
I'm not sure,

465
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,226
but I've heard she has a unit
at Quahog Storage.

466
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,462
Apparently that chick's
a complete psycho.

467
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:35,729
We got to get over there!

468
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,498
Come on, you guys, let's go!

469
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, man, I hope we don't catch
them doing something freaky.

470
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:41,869
I'm still weirded out
from when I walked in

471
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:43,571
on that masturbating Eskimo.

472
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,840
Dinner time, Tikaloo.

473
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:47,141
Oh, my God!

474
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:48,876
Doesn't anybody knock?

475
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:55,015
Hey, Stewie, look, I want
to apologize about earlier.

476
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,684
What the hell is this?

477
00:17:56,718 --> 00:17:59,487
Brian, I think it's time
that Rupert made his choice.

478
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:00,721
What are you talking about?

479
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:02,123
Talking about love, Bri.

480
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:03,691
Talking about adult decisions.

481
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:05,826
Rupert's been with me,
and now he's been with you.

482
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:07,495
It's time for him to pick.

483
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:09,563
Stewie, this is stupid;
I'm not doing this.

484
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:13,100
Brian, either you cooperate or I
blow my Adam Levine dog whistle.

485
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,002
Hey, my voice isn't that high.

486
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:16,103
It is.

487
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,471
It is though.

488
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:18,639
All right, Rupert.

489
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:19,707
Who will it be?

490
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:20,808
And before you answer,

491
00:18:20,842 --> 00:18:22,877
think of all the
good times we've had.

492
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:25,246
The time we met The Beatles
on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show,</i>

493
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,915
that winter we lived
on the sun,

494
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:29,283
and here's my favorite.

495
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,119
A blank one we can fill up

496
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,488
with a future together.

497
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:41,595
Yes!

498
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,031
Oh, my God, Rupert, I'm
so sorry for everything!

499
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:45,399
I missed you, too!

500
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:46,767
Whatever.

501
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,802
Hey, you done
with that weird octopus doll?

502
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:52,606
It's you and me forever, Rupert.

503
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:55,409
I just hope Oscar
didn't take it too hard.

504
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:06,153
This is it, number 92.

505
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,755
This is Sonja's storage unit.

506
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:09,924
Quagmire, are you in there?

507
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,194
Oh, he's eating.

508
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:15,529
We'll come back
when you're done eating.

509
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:23,037
Glenn!

510
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,271
Hurry, she'll be back soon.

511
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:26,373
I can't believe the
guy with the ponytail

512
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:28,008
and the facial tattoo
at the front desk

513
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,243
would let this happen.

514
00:19:29,277 --> 00:19:30,945
Well, what's this?

515
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,680
We got company?

516
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,048
Hold it right there.

517
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:35,182
Please.

518
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,051
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

519
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:38,419
Boy, if you were
ever gonna stand,

520
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:40,487
this would be
the time, Joe.

521
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:42,022
Everybody, just shut up!

522
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:45,025
You idiots should've
minded your own business.

523
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,160
This is our business.

524
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:47,628
You kidnapped our friend.

525
00:19:47,662 --> 00:19:49,163
You're going to jail.

526
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:51,065
Don't come any closer
or I'll shoot you.

527
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,033
Oh, I don't think
you're gonna shoot me.

528
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,468
You don't got the boobs.

529
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:55,569
What?

530
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:56,670
I-I don't know.

531
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,739
Now, just hand me
the gun, Sonja.

532
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:00,941
Oh, I swear to God,
you get one inch closer to me,

533
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:02,076
and I'm gonna shoot you.

534
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,182
What the hell?

535
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,318
Like I said, you're
going to jail.

536
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:13,087
Oh, my God, Joe,
that was so close.

537
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:14,622
How'd you know the
gun would jam?

538
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:16,023
It didn't jam, Peter.

539
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:17,258
The gun was never loaded.

540
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,560
Sort of had
a mental breakdown in April.

541
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,695
No more bullets for this guy.

542
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,831
Oh, Glenn, I was so
worried about you.

543
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,866
Are you all right?
No, no,

544
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,202
I'm pretty  far
from all right.

545
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:30,537
Well, I guess this is
as good a time as any.

546
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:32,473
Happy birthday, Joe.

547
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:33,907
You dick!

548
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,846
Thanks for your help, guys.

549
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,560
I might not be alive
if it weren't for you.

550
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:42,049
Hey, no problem, buddy.

551
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,218
Yeah, you'd have done the
same for us, Quagmire.

552
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,919
You know, I guess
what I realized from all this

553
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,716
is that when it comes
to relationships,

554
00:20:47,717 --> 00:20:49,018
I need to be the kinky one.

555
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:51,384
Ah, we're just glad
to have you back, Quagmire.

556
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:54,240
Yep, and it's good to put
all those troubles behind us.

557
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:57,490
My dad told me
he's pregnant.
