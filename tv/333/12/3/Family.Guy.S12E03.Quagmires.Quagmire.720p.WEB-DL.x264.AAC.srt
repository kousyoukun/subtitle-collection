Hey, thanks for helping me pick
out a new computer, you guys.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,372
Oh, no problem,
Quagmire.

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,041
God, this place is
always so crowded.

13
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,709
We gotta find someone
who works here.

14
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,910
Can I help you, sir?

15
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,479
Sorry, all I got
is a quarter, pal.

16
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,148
Oh, excuse me, sir.

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,016
My buddy here is
looking for a computer.

18
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,218
I would like to elect you
president.

19
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,422
What are you doing?

20
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:58,190
You gonna get a new phone
while we're here?

21
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,858
Maybe. But I gotta see
which one

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,261
I wanna take in and out of
my pocket every 30 seconds

23
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,562
for the next six years.

24
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,863
What do you think,
Peter? Peter?

25
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:08,167
I touched a iPhone headphone.

26
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,004
You know what?
I think I'm gonna
go with this one.

27
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,173
Guy said it's
the newest version.
Just came out this week.

28
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,441
Ah, good call,
Quagmire.

29
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,842
You're gonna be like
the first guy

30
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,210
in the neighborhood
to own a Model T.

31
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,546
(engine chugging)

32
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,347
See ya, suckers!

33
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,118
I'll be there an hour after you
with throw-up all over my legs!

34
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,256
Are you getting excited
for Halloween, Stewie?

35
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,225
You know, we'll have
to start thinking

36
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,560
about your costume soon.

37
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,028
All right, but let's make sure

38
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,763
we don't cover up this,
all right?

39
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,765
It's what puts candy in the bag.

40
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,533
Oh, look, Chris,
here's your costume

41
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,535
from the year you went
as a condom.

42
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,238
What the hell are you
supposed to be?

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,408
(gasps)
Oh, Stewie, look!

44
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,010
It's your very
first teddy bear!

45
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,280
Oscar?

46
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,116
Wow, I remember
that bear.

47
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,084
That's the one Grandma
and Grandpa brought Stewie

48
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,953
when he was still
in the hospital.

49
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,654
Oh, and here's the card
they sent me.

50
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:07,459
"Three kids on $40,000?
Have fun with your crap life."

51
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,294
I guess he got tucked
away up here.

52
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,063
You want him back,
sweetie?

53
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,567
What, this old thing?

54
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,835
No, no, thank you.
I've grown.

55
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:17,903
I've changed.

56
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,304
You sure you
don't want him?

57
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,506
I said no, okay?

58
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,840
Don't you have
a wedding dress

59
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,009
to try halfway on
and then cry about?

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,580
(phone rings)

61
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,482
Hello? Oh, hey, Quagmire.
What's up?

62
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,818
Hey, Peter, I need
some help with my computer.

63
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,019
I can't find my photos.

64
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,354
Did you look
under "Photos"?

65
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,421
What is that?

66
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,756
It's a folder
called "Photos."

67
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,124
Yeah, I-I don't have that.

68
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,026
I just have 40 folders
all called "New Folder."

69
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,095
Okay. You know what?
Click on your hard drive.

70
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,696
Okay, now-now the arrow
on the screen,

71
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,165
that's me, right?

72
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,833
Yeah, yeah, that's you.
Okay, now-now just...

73
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,801
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
There's a calculator
on this thing?!

74
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,137
(sighs) Listen, Quagmire,
what are you trying to do?

75
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,772
I just wanna put pictures
of my cat

76
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,806
on everyone's
Internet computer.

77
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,308
Like, how do I do that?

78
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,843
Okay, wait.
There's an agreement
that just popped up.

79
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,344
Hang on. L-Let me read
the whole thing.

80
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,979
Just hit "Accept."

81
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,381
Well, that seems
a little foolhardy,
doesn't it, Peter?

82
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,183
Look, do we have
to do this now?

83
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,184
I'm watching something.

84
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,351
I know. I'm sorry.

85
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,120
I-I'm just nervous
that somebody else

86
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,688
is gonna get pictures
of their cat on the
Internet first,

87
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,623
and then I'll always be known
as the second guy

88
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,458
to get pictures of his cat
on the Internet.

89
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,360
Quagmire, I don't know
how to tell you this,

90
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,962
but there's already
cats on the Internet.

91
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,530
Wait, it's-it's giving me
that pinwheel thing.

92
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,333
It-It's frozen. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, it crashed!

93
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,668
The whole thing
just crashed!

94
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,869
Geez, Quagmire,
calm down.

95
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,003
We'll figure it out.

96
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,505
No, Peter,
the whole thing's fried!

97
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:27,739
I can't even...!

98
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,341
(gasps) Ah! damn it!
What the hell?!

99
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,410
Hey, you clicked "Accept."

100
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,315
Hey, what's going on?

101
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,749
You doing some
reading there?

102
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,551
Yes, well, you know
I turn to poetry

103
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,486
when matters of the heart
weigh heavily on me.

104
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,222
"If you're happy
and you know it,

105
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,692
"then your face will
surely show it.

106
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,827
"If you're happy
and you know it,

107
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,395
"clap your hands.

108
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,430
Anonymous."

109
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,664
Wait-- matters
of the heart?

110
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,366
What are you
talking about?

111
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,735
Well, Lois found my old teddy
bear, Oscar, in the attic.

112
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,037
And I'm just not sure how
to handle it,

113
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,706
what with Rupert and all.

114
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,207
Who cares?
Just play with them both.

115
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,442
I can't do that!

116
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,210
Oh, it would be
so awkward!

117
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,545
Um... okay.

118
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,779
Oscar was my...

119
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,581
well, he was my first,
you know.

120
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,183
And that's always exciting.

121
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,218
But-but I've been
with Rupert for so
long now.

122
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,353
Uh-huh.

123
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,621
Most of our finances
are intertwined.

124
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,055
We've built
a life together.

125
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,924
On the other hand,
Oscar...

126
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,093
Oscar's the only one who can
really make me laugh.

127
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:24,730
I hate to say it,
but I'm mostly with Rupert
because of his insurance.

128
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,298
Stewie, I think you're
overthinking this.

129
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,066
No, you're right.
You're right, Brian.

130
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,101
I'm with Rupert now.

131
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,769
I just need
to forget Oscar.

132
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,238
No matter how intense
our relationship was.

133
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,040
(stereo playing jazz)

134
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,944
That's amazing.

135
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,879
It's like you took
all the colors that exist

136
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,449
and said, "(bleep),
here's a new one."

137
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,055
Hi, can I help you?

138
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,290
Well, that depends.

139
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,724
Do you know how
to fix pieces of junk?!

140
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,159
Haven't been stumped yet.

141
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,295
(computer plays woman moaning)

142
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,264
Okay, I see what
your problem is.

143
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,400
I-I-I tried to buy
a sweater online,

144
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,168
and I-I think
I got a virus.

145
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,637
No, the porn's
not the problem.

146
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,105
Your browser history shows

147
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,940
that you've been going
to kinkylatinas.net.

148
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,310
But that site has
a bunch of malware.

149
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,611
Oh.

150
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,279
Personally, I'd recommend
College Latinas.

151
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,648
I mean, I wanna see Latinas,
but I also want them to

152
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,650
Speak English.
speak English.
Yes, exactly.

153
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,586
Wow. So you're into that kind
of stuff, too?

154
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,689
(sultry):
Uh-huh.

155
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,192
Would you, uh,
would you have
dinner with me?

156
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,860
Absolutely.

157
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,363
Excuse me. I bought this
laptop here yesterday,

158
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,333
but when I got home I noticed
the apple already had

159
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,102
a bite taken out of it!

160
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,508
So, yeah, I was
the first woman

161
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,777
to ride her bike
cross-country
with no seat.

162
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,045
Gosh, that's neat, Sonja.

163
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,380
And-and where'd
you go to college?

164
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,482
I think Syracuse,
but I don't know.

165
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:53,185
My face was buried
in a pillow all four years.

166
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,654
Wow, sounds like you took
a full class load.

167
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,222
(laughs)

168
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,392
Oh, Glenn, I'm so glad
you asked me out.

169
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,027
Whenever I talk
about stuff like this,

170
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,495
most people look at me

171
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,297
like I'm some kind
of disgusting perv.

172
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,531
Me, too, but who cares?

173
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,333
You should never be afraid
to be different.

174
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,301
Hoo.

175
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,335
Hoo.

176
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:13,071
Whom.

177
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,143
Morning.

178
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,912
(yawns) Morning.

179
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,181
We kind of had
a crazy night.

180
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,583
Yeah, we... Did we?

181
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,251
I don't really remember,

182
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,520
but I do feel like I might
be down a couple of quarts.

183
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,921
(empty metal drum banging)

184
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,324
Well, even though you seemed
like a sure thing,

185
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,227
I really wanted
to make sure.

186
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,997
Oh, my God!
You roofied me?!

187
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,198
Are you mad?

188
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,002
No. I'm in love!

189
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,205
Sonja, honey,
stay right here.

190
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,174
I just have to go
to the bathroom.

191
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,442
Wait, Glenn.

192
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:53,245
Take this wine glass.
We can use it later.

193
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,247
(voice breaks):
My God, I...

194
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,182
I've never been so happy!

195
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,924
I'm telling you guys,
Sonja is the perfect woman.

196
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,393
She's every bit as kinky
and as insatiable as I am.

197
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,196
Really?
I thought you said she was
just some computer geek.

198
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:12,798
She is.

199
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,534
Her mouth has enough storage
space for a giggity-byte. Oh!

200
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,068
(text alert beeps)

201
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,904
Geez, you changed your
relationship status already?

202
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,372
When you know, you know.

203
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,140
All right, but just
be careful, ya know?

204
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,809
You don't wanna rush an
important decision.

205
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,277
I'll take
the cheeseburger meal.

206
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,379
Would you like to make it
an extra large meal?

207
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:30,148
Uh...

208
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,985
(insects chirring)

209
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,255
(thunder crashes)

210
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,657
(birds chirping)

211
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,559
(insects chirring)

212
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,327
(wind whistling)

213
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,929
(people screaming, shouting)

214
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,231
(explosion)

215
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,266
(people screaming, shouting)

216
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,001
(lasers zapping)

217
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,775
N-No. Yes.

218
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:57,976
No.

219
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,278
You sure? It's only
29 cents more.

220
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,513
Yes.

221
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,482
No.

222
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,855
What the hell?

223
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,658
Stewie, what are you doing
up here?

224
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,527
(gasps)
Brian!

225
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:16,995
It's not what you think!

226
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,630
All right, I came up here
for a photo shoot

227
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,632
and it just got way,
way out of hand!

228
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:21,700
You're having tea.

229
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,268
How is that
out of hand?

230
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,036
Is your shirt
on backwards?

231
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,372
Please! You can't tell Rupert
I was up here, all right?

232
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,040
He wouldn't understand.
He'll kill himself, Brian!

233
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,609
He's been through so much
already!

234
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,210
He can't take much more!

235
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,513
Brian, he watched
his brother drown!

236
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,981
Stewie, relax.

237
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,816
You're getting all
worked up over nothing.

238
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,351
Says the guy who freaks out

239
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,386
every time
a fire engine goes by.

240
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,654
(siren wails)

241
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,489
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

242
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,024
(howls)

243
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,561
Peter, Peter,
you hear that?!
(howls)

244
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:53,698
I'm matching the sound!
(howls)

245
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,901
Is what I'm doing helping?

246
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,540
Glenn, why did you
bring me here?

247
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,807
Well, I've always had
this fantasy

248
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,242
of having sex on
the basketball court

249
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,810
in front of my
high school principal.

250
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:10,015
Only problem is he's
now completely senile.

251
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,517
Yeah, you like this,
Principal Goodrich, huh?

252
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,752
Remember you once
suspended me

253
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,353
for showing my wiener
in school?

254
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,888
I did?

255
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,024
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

256
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,992
I'm sorry, Sonja,
I don't think I can finish.

257
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,061
You never could finish,
Quagmire!

258
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,430
Donahue, get in there!

259
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,668
Okay, Glenn, now that we've
covered ourselves in black ink,

260
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,269
let's do it until
we've created

261
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,573
every character in
the Chinese alphabet.

262
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,084
When all said and done,

263
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,454
Quagmire body tell story
of sadness.

264
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,960
Oh, wow, I can't even imagine
what twisted deviant act

265
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,595
you've thought of this time.

266
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,197
I want you to have sex
with your father.

267
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,732
What?!

268
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,367
Yep, and I'm gonna watch.

269
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,535
Hi, Glenn.

270
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,604
Are you crazy?! No!
No way!

271
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,206
Glenn, remember,
the thing we love
most about each other

272
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,874
is that we push
each other

273
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,311
way beyond
our normal boundaries.

274
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,647
Did you enjoy your stay
at the Marriott?

275
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,716
No, I did not.

276
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,255
STEWIE:
Oh, well, excuse me for not
being six months old anymore!

277
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,224
Oh, and here come
the tears!

278
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,227
The show is starting,
everyone! Come on down!

279
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,330
What's all that noise?

280
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,798
What the hell's
going on up there?

281
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,433
We're in a fight is
what's going on!

282
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,469
Brian, I need you to settle
an argument for us:

283
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,670
am I Hitler?

284
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,405
Because I don't think
that I am,

285
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,108
(chuckling): but maybe-maybe
I'm off base on this.

286
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,242
Stewie, take it easy.

287
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,510
No, you know what?

288
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,578
You may as well call
your family now

289
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,013
because I'm not going
to Sarasota.

290
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,681
I don't care
if we can't get a refund,

291
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:50,749
we're through!

292
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,950
Here, Brian, you take him.

293
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,151
Maybe you can make him happy.

294
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,619
What?
You heard me. Take him.

295
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,254
Do whatever you want
with him, I don't care.

296
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,589
Rupert and I are over!

297
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,623
Are you sure?

298
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,791
Yes, we're done.

299
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,292
I just hope we can
handle it better

300
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,927
than blue and yellow
did when they split up.

301
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,030
You were supposed to have
the kids here by 5:00.

302
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,164
We have plans.

303
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,332
It's 5:15.

304
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,667
Stop busting my hump, Alicia.

305
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,168
Okay, you know
what, let's not...

306
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,536
let's not do this
in front of the kids.

307
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,837
God, you're right.

308
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,005
What ever happened to us?

309
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,874
Hey, baby, you
ready for dinner?

310
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:16,975
What's up, Scott?

311
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,244
We gonna get
some barbecue.

312
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,648
Hey, guys.

313
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,183
No, indoors, not okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

314
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,551
Don't do it.
Nighttime, not allowed.

315
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,986
What? There's nothing
wrong with this.

316
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,121
No, no way, give me those.

317
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,557
Oh, my God.

318
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,159
Quagmire,
what the hell happened?

319
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,694
Is this another one
of those sex-related injuries

320
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,861
you keep getting?

321
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,563
Yeah, it seems like lately

322
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,565
that girlfriend of yours is
taking things a little too far.

323
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,967
No, she's not;
everything's great with us.

324
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,092
Are you guys still talking
about Sonja?

325
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,426
All right, I should
probably get going.

326
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,761
Sonja and I are
supposed to go

327
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,363
to a "Brown Eyes
Wide Shut" party.

328
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,432
Geez, I don't know what's
going on with him.

329
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,568
But I guess love does
funny things to people.

330
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,936
Look at Forrest Gump.

331
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,537
Hi, Forrest.

332
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,873
I know you just got back
from Vietnam and you love me,

333
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,608
but I'm gonna go run a train

334
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,610
with this group
of Black Panthers I just met.

335
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,612
Okay, Jenny.

336
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,114
Hi, Forrest.

337
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,349
I know you came all this way
to New York to visit me,

338
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,684
but I'm gonna go do blow

339
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,352
and have sex
with a bunch of stockbrokers.

340
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,287
Okay, Jenny.

341
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,522
Hi, Forrest.

342
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,057
Now that I have
the most contagious

343
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,059
and incurable disease
known to mankind,

344
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,961
I'll finally have pity sex
with you.

345
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,729
Okay, Jenny.

346
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:48,366
And I'll mow the grass
and raise the AIDS baby.

347
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,570
SONJA:
Hey, sexy.

348
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,806
Sonja, what are you doing here?

349
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,475
Well, I got tired of waiting
for you to get home,

350
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,577
so I thought I'd come to you.

351
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,812
Come on, Sonja. How about...

352
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,280
how about
we take a night off, huh?

353
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,715
The sex has just been nonstop.

354
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,417
I mean, I understand
that "no" doesn't mean "no,"

355
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,020
but certainly some word
has got to mean "no."

356
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,958
This is one of your
fantasies, right?

357
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,127
Public humiliation?

358
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,997
Mm, it's sexy, isn't it?

359
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,166
(cries out)

360
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,634
(crying)
Sonja, stop, please!

361
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,336
Come on, you love it.

362
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,809
Ow! Ow! Ow!

363
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,344
You're hurting me, and I really
need to clean out my trunk!

364
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,180
Oh, I'm gonna clean
out your trunk.

365
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,447
Giggity.

366
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,950
That's my word. That's my word!

367
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,686
(muffled screaming)

368
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,324
Okay, Joe, Joe,
you're drunk, okay?

369
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,426
You're drunk;
give me your keys.

370
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,762
And-and I'm drunk,
so I'll give you my keys.

371
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:54,098
Okay, now we're both good
to drive home.

372
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,804
You been drinking
tonight, sir?

373
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:03,374
Uh, no, Officer, I just had
a glass of dinner with my wine.

374
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,710
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car

375
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,046
and walk a straight
line, please.

376
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,481
All right,
you be safe, sir.

377
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,750
There's a lot of crazies
out there tonight.

378
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,558
(doorbell rings)

379
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,695
Oh, hey, Mr. and
Mrs. Quagmire.

380
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:24,896
Hi, Peter.

381
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,231
I'm a little worried
about Glenn.

382
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,899
I haven't heard
from him in days.

383
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,067
Have you seen him?

384
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,335
I haven't seen anybody.

385
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,036
I've been grounded
for pinching a girl.

386
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,172
Hey, are you guys talking
about Quagmire?

387
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,740
He never showed
this morning,

388
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,509
and today's the day
we usually go apple picking.

389
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,911
Get that one.

390
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,045
Get that one!

391
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,413
Hey, get that one.

392
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,748
Get that one over there.

393
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,483
No, not-not that one.

394
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,018
I already got it!
I can't put it back!

395
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,586
Well, it's not
going in the pie.

396
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,321
Well, if you're so smart,
why don't you come up here

397
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,389
and pick them yourself?

398
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,491
And now there's
no pie at all.

399
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,026
I've already checked
Glenn's house,

400
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,694
and there's no sign
he's even been there.

401
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,696
I'm afraid something terrible
has happened.

402
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,498
Now let's not jump
to any conclusions.

403
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm sure if we just check
his usual hangouts,

404
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,935
someone will have seen him.

405
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,403
Wait a second.

406
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,105
He hangs out at the Clam
with some fat loudmouth.

407
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,574
You find Loudy McFatass,
you find Quagmire.

408
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,009
Come on, let's go.

409
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,877
But, Dad, it's the
night of my big show!

410
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,814
Oh, Chris, I was never
gonna go to that.

411
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,753
We should get some food
in you, mister.

412
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,621
You hardly ate
any of that cereal

413
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,089
I smashed
on your mouth yesterday.

414
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,724
(gasps)
Brian?

415
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,526
Oh, hey.

416
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,094
What the hell are you doing?

417
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,397
Oh, I've been kind of using
Rupert as a chew toy.

418
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,765
Chewing him
with your crotch?

419
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,566
Hey, dogs like humping
stuffed animals.

420
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,801
What can I say?

421
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,202
Besides, you said
I could have Rupert.

422
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,938
I thought you liked
Oscar better anyway.

423
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,406
Well, I just changed my mind.

424
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,142
And you know Rupert's a dude,
right, you gaylord?

425
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,247
Okay, you guys, where should
we start looking for Glenn?

426
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,149
Well, sometimes Quagmire
likes to hang out

427
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,917
under all the clutter
in my garage.

428
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,219
So, why don't we
just start sorting stuff

429
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,721
and throwing stuff away

430
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:57,956
but obviously checking
with me first

431
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,157
before you throw stuff away.

432
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,758
No problem, Peter.

433
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,827
Quagmire, if you're in
there, hang tight, buddy.

434
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,295
We're coming.

435
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,897
Right, and if we can't
find him in here,

436
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,298
he sometimes likes to hang out

437
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,167
in between the blades
of grass in my lawn.

438
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,669
And also in the firewood
that needs to be split.

439
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,638
Might he be under the leaves
in your gutter?

440
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,006
Great question,
and yes, he might.

441
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,908
So, while you guys
are taking care of that,

442
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,810
I'll be around back
flicking pinecones

443
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,878
at a tree
with this hockey stick.

444
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,285
Aloha.
Welcome to Ryan's Hawaiians.

445
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,653
Hey, how you doing?

446
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,787
Amazing.

447
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,155
Have you seen this man?

448
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,623
Glenn Quagmire?

449
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,993
Nah, the last time I saw him
was three months ago.

450
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,761
Sold him 70 red shirts.

451
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,763
Yeah, he does look
good in that shirt.

452
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,865
Uh, everyone looks good
in my shirts.

453
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,300
How about you, Big Island?

454
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,634
Uh, I don't know.

455
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,303
Do you want to be
an oldies' DJ

456
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,971
or a 1980's wrestling manager?

457
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,506
Yes, both.

458
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,875
This is beautiful.

459
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,510
Heart disease looks better

460
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,246
when it's wrapped in a
tropical, floral pattern.

461
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,984
Oh, my God, this is hopeless.

462
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,819
We've been searching for hours.

463
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,287
Glenn could be dead by now.

464
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,289
I know, and if you guys
are really hungry,

465
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,357
I suppose I could eat.

466
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,658
Come on, we can't give up.

467
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,360
Someone's got to
have seen Quagmire.

468
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,962
Or if not him,
at least Sonja.

469
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,031
Excuse me, did you
just say "Sonja"?

470
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,165
Yes! I did!

471
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,466
That was my dog's name.

472
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,802
Excuse me,
did he just say "Sonja"?

473
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,070
Yeah, it was his dog's name.

474
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,072
Oh, I thought
he might have been talking

475
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,141
about this super kinky woman
who's always down here,

476
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,043
trying to lure men
to her sex slave shed.

477
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,011
No, I think he was talking
about his dog.

478
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,213
No, Peter, that's the
Sonja we're looking for.

479
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,315
Sonja must have
taken Glenn there.

480
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,051
Where exactly is
this sex slave shed?

481
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,419
I'm not sure,

482
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,320
but I've heard she has a unit
at Quahog Storage.

483
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,589
Apparently that chick's
a complete psycho.

484
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,757
We got to get over there!

485
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,559
Come on, you guys,
let's go!

486
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,062
Oh, man, I hope we don't catch
them doing something freaky.

487
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,997
I'm still weirded out
from when I walked in

488
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,732
on that masturbating Eskimo.

489
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,034
Dinner time, Tikaloo.

490
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,235
Oh, my God!

491
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,237
Doesn't anybody knock?

492
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,177
Hey, Stewie, look, I want
to apologize about earlier.

493
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,778
What the hell is this?

494
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,548
Brian, I think it's time
that Rupert made his choice.

495
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,882
What are you talking about?

496
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,217
Talking about love, Bri.

497
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,852
Talking about adult decisions.

498
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,921
Rupert's been with me,
and now he's been with you.

499
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,622
It's time for him to pick.

500
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,691
Stewie, this is stupid;
I'm not doing this.

501
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,195
Brian, either you cooperate or I
blow my Adam Levine dog whistle.

502
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,130
Hey, my voice isn't that high.

503
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,264
It is.

504
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,566
It is though.

505
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:22,767
All right, Rupert.

506
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,801
Who will it be?

507
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,136
And before you answer,

508
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,971
think of all the
good times we've had.

509
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,307
The time we met The Beatles
on   <i>The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

510
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,110
That winter we lived
on the sun.

511
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,377
And here's my favorite.

512
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,280
A blank one we can fill up

513
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,816
with a future together.

514
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,923
Yes!

515
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,126
Oh, my God, Rupert, I'm
so sorry for everything!

516
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,594
I missed you, too!

517
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:50,928
Whatever.

518
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,164
Hey, you done
with that weird octopus doll?

519
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,667
It's you and me forever, Rupert.

520
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,737
I just hope Oscar
didn't take it too hard.

521
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,181
This is it, number 92.

522
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,916
This is Sonja's
storage unit.

523
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:14,085
Quagmire, are you in there?

524
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,953
(muffled screaming)

525
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,288
Oh, he's eating.

526
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,857
We'll come back
when you're done eating.

527
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,165
Glenn!

528
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,599
Hurry, she'll be back soon.

529
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,434
I can't believe the
guy with the ponytail

530
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,103
and the facial tattoo
at the front desk

531
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,337
would let this happen.

532
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,139
SONJA:
Well, what's this?

533
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,774
We got company?

534
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,209
Hold it right there.

535
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,343
Please.

536
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,145
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

537
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,446
Boy, if you were
ever gonna stand,

538
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,615
this would be
the time, Joe.

539
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,150
Everybody, just shut up!

540
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:49,153
You idiots should've
minded your own business.

541
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,288
This is our business.

542
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,722
You kidnapped our friend.

543
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,224
You're going to jail.

544
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,126
Don't come any closer
or I'll shoot you!

545
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,161
Oh, I don't think
you're gonna shoot me.

546
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,563
You don't got the boobs.

547
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,697
What?

548
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,831
I-I don't know.

549
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,700
Now, just hand me
the gun, Sonja.

550
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,036
Oh, I swear to God,
you get one inch closer to me,

551
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,404
and I'm gonna shoot you.

552
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,975
(gun clicking)

553
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,476
What the hell?

554
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,346
Like I said, you're
going to jail.

555
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,048
Oh, my God, Joe,
that was so close.

556
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,716
How'd you know the
gun would jam?

557
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,151
It didn't jam, Peter.

558
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,485
The gun was never loaded.

559
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,688
Sort of had
a mental breakdown in April.

560
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,690
No more bullets for this guy.

561
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,892
Oh, Glenn, I was so
worried about you.

562
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,927
Are you all right?
No, no,

563
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,196
I'm pretty (bleep) far
from all right.

564
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,665
Well, I guess this is
as good a time as any.

565
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,567
Happy birthday, Joe.

566
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,236
You dick!

567
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,907
Thanks for your help, guys.

568
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,709
I might not be alive
if it weren't for you.

569
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,210
Hey, no problem, buddy.

570
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,279
Yeah, you would've done the
same for us, Quagmire.

571
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,181
You know, I guess
what I realized from all this

572
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,849
is that when it comes
to relationships,

573
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,417
I need to be the kinky one.

574
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,620
Ah, we're just glad
to have you back, Quagmire.

575
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:59,190
Yep, and it's good to put
all those troubles behind us.

576
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,292
My dad told me
he's pregnant.

577
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,793
