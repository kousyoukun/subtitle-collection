12
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:37,968
Hey, thanks for helping me pick
out a new computer, you guys.

13
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:39,269
Oh, no problem,
Quagmire.

14
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:40,971
God, this place is
always so crowded.

15
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,573
We gotta find someone
who works here.

16
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:43,841
Can I help you, sir?

17
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,343
Sorry, all I got
is a quarter, pal.

18
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:47,978
Oh, excuse me, sir.

19
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:49,980
My buddy here is
looking for a computer.

20
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:51,915
I would like to elect you
president.

21
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:55,119
What are you doing?

22
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,121
You gonna get a new phone
while we're here?

23
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:58,655
Maybe. But I gotta see
which one

24
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,258
I wanna take in and out of
my pocket every 30 seconds

25
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,493
for the next six years.

26
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:03,767
What do you think,
Peter? Peter?

27
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:06,930
I touched a iPhone headphone.

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,934
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go with this one.

29
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:13,103
Guy said it's the newest version.
Just came out this week.

30
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:14,104
Ah, good call,
Quagmire.

31
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:15,506
You're gonna be like
the first guy

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,107
in the neighborhood
to own a Model T.

33
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:19,443
(engine chugging)

34
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:21,078
See ya, suckers!

35
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:24,848
I'll be there an hour after you
with throw-up all over my legs!

36
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:30,220
Are you getting excited
for Halloween, Stewie?

37
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:32,122
You know, we'll have
to start thinking

38
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:33,490
about your costume soon.

39
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:34,958
All right, but let's make sure

40
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:36,693
we don't cover up this,
all right?

41
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:38,629
It's what puts candy in the bag.

42
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:40,431
Oh, look, Chris,
here's your costume

43
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,466
from the year you went
as a condom.

44
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,135
What the hell are you
supposed to be?

45
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,338
(gasps)
Oh, Stewie, look!

46
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:50,774
It's your very
first teddy bear!

47
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,178
Oscar?

48
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:56,013
Wow, I remember
that bear.

49
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:57,981
That's the one Grandma
and Grandpa brought Stewie

50
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,883
when he was still
in the hospital.

51
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,718
Oh, and here's the card
they sent me.

52
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:06,423
"Three kids on $40,000?
Have fun with your crap life."

53
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,258
I guess he got tucked
away up here.

54
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:09,827
You want him back,
sweetie?

55
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:14,431
What, this old thing?

56
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:15,699
No, no, thank you.
I've grown.

57
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:16,733
I've changed.

58
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:18,202
You sure you
don't want him?

59
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:19,369
I said no, okay?

60
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:20,737
Don't you have
a wedding dress

61
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:22,739
to try halfway on
and then cry about?

62
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:27,544
(phone rings)

63
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,346
Hello? Oh, hey, Quagmire.
What's up?

64
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,682
Hey, Peter, I need
some help with my computer.

65
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:32,950
I can't find my photos.

66
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:34,218
Did you look
under "Photos"?

67
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:35,352
What is that?

68
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,653
It's a folder
called "Photos."

69
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:37,921
Yeah, I-I don't have that.

70
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,957
I just have 40 folders
all called "New Folder."

71
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,992
Okay. You know what?
Click on your hard drive.

72
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:43,594
Okay, now-now the arrow
on the screen,

73
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:44,895
that's me, right?

74
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,763
Yeah, yeah, that's you.
Okay, now-now just...

75
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:48,799
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
There's a calculator on this thing?!

76
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,001
(sighs) Listen, Quagmire,
what are you trying to do?

77
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:51,930
I just wanna put pictures
of my cat

78
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,356
on everyone's
Internet computer.

79
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:54,557
Like, how do I do that?

80
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,773
Okay, wait. There's an agreement
that just popped up.

81
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:58,442
Hang on. L-Let me read
the whole thing.

82
00:02:58,476 --> 00:02:59,643
Just hit "Accept."

83
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:01,478
Well, that seems a little foolhardy,
doesn't it, Peter?

84
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:03,146
Look, do we have
to do this now?

85
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,147
I'm watching something.

86
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:05,148
I know. I'm sorry.

87
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:06,517
I-I'm just nervous
that somebody else

88
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,652
is gonna get pictures
of their cat on the Internet first,

89
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:10,621
and then I'll always be known
as the second guy

90
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:12,489
to get pictures of his cat
on the Internet.

91
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:14,391
Quagmire, I don't know
how to tell you this,

92
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:15,926
but there's already
cats on the Internet.

93
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,461
Wait, it's-it's giving me
that pinwheel thing.

94
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:20,264
It-It's frozen. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, it crashed!

95
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:21,732
The whole thing
just crashed!

96
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:22,833
Geez, Quagmire,
calm down.

97
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:23,934
We'll figure it out.

98
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,469
No, Peter,
the whole thing's fried!

99
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:26,570
I can't even...!

100
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:28,272
(gasps) Ah! damn it!
What the hell?!

101
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,140
Hey, you clicked "Accept."

102
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:35,245
Hey, what's going on?

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,747
You doing some
reading there?

104
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,549
Yes, well, you know
I turn to poetry

105
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,450
when matters of the heart
weigh heavily on me.

106
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:42,185
"If you're happy
and you know it,

107
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,656
"then your face will
surely show it.

108
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,724
"If you're happy
and you know it,

109
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,326
"clap your hands.

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,327
Anonymous."

111
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:51,628
Wait-- matters
of the heart?

112
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,030
What are you
talking about?

113
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:55,732
Well, Lois found my old teddy
bear, Oscar, in the attic.

114
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:57,968
And I'm just not sure how
to handle it,

115
00:03:58,002 --> 00:03:59,603
what with Rupert and all.

116
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:01,204
Who cares?
Just play with them both.

117
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,439
I can't do that!

118
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:04,074
Oh, it would be
so awkward!

119
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:05,442
Um... okay.

120
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:06,777
Oscar was my...

121
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:08,512
well, he was my first,
you know.

122
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:09,947
And that's always exciting.

123
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:12,082
But-but I've been
with Rupert for so long now.

124
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:13,083
Uh-huh.

125
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,618
Most of our finances
are intertwined.

126
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:16,053
We've built
a life together.

127
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:17,888
On the other hand,
Oscar...

128
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:20,190
Oscar's the only one who can
really make me laugh.

129
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:23,694
I hate to say it, but I'm mostly
with Rupert because of his insurance.

130
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:25,329
Stewie, I think you're
overthinking this.

131
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:26,964
No, you're right.
You're right, Brian.

132
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:28,031
I'm with Rupert now.

133
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,766
I just need
to forget Oscar.

134
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:32,135
No matter how intense
our relationship was.

135
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,770
(stereo playing jazz)

136
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:37,941
That's amazing.

137
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:39,910
It's like you took
all the colors that exist

138
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:43,146
and said, "(bleep),
here's a new one."

139
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:48,919
Hi, can I help you?

140
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:49,920
Well, that depends.

141
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:51,622
Do you know how
to fix pieces of junk?!

142
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:53,123
Haven't been stumped yet.

143
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:55,258
(computer plays woman moaning)

144
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:58,161
Okay, I see what
your problem is.

145
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:00,330
I-I-I tried to buy
a sweater online,

146
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:02,199
and I-I think
I got a virus.

147
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,601
No, the porn's
not the problem.

148
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:06,103
Your browser history shows

149
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:07,938
that you've been going
to kinkylatinas.net.

150
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:10,207
But that site has
a bunch of malware.

151
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:11,408
Oh.

152
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:12,843
Personally, I'd recommend
College Latinas.

153
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:15,679
I mean, I wanna see Latinas,
but I also want them to

154
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:17,681
Speak English. speak English.
Yes, exactly.

155
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:20,517
Wow. So you're into that kind
of stuff, too?

156
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:22,386
(sultry):
Uh-huh.

157
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:26,123
Would you, uh, would you have
dinner with me?

158
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:27,891
Absolutely.

159
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:30,360
Excuse me. I bought this
laptop here yesterday,

160
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:33,230
but when I got home I noticed
the apple already had

161
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:35,832
a bite taken out of it!

162
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:42,572
So, yeah, I was
the first woman

163
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:44,641
to ride her bike
cross-country with no seat.

164
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:46,009
Gosh, that's neat, Sonja.

165
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,377
And-and where'd
you go to college?

166
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:49,479
I think Syracuse,
but I don't know.

167
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:52,149
My face was buried
in a pillow all four years.

168
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,551
Wow, sounds like you took
a full class load.

169
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:56,253
(laughs)

170
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:59,389
Oh, Glenn, I'm so glad
you asked me out.

171
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:00,991
Whenever I talk
about stuff like this,

172
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:02,426
most people look at me

173
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,161
like I'm some kind
of disgusting perv.

174
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:05,395
Me, too, but who cares?

175
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,264
You should never be afraid
to be different.

176
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:08,265
Hoo.

177
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,266
Hoo.

178
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,768
Whom.

179
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:17,040
Morning.

180
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:19,876
(yawns) Morning.

181
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,079
We kind of had
a crazy night.

182
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,513
Yeah, we... Did we?

183
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:24,715
I don't really remember,

184
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:27,484
but I do feel like I might
be down a couple of quarts.

185
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:28,685
(empty metal drum banging)

186
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,221
Well, even though you seemed
like a sure thing,

187
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:33,924
I really wanted
to make sure.

188
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,894
Oh, my God!
You roofied me?!

189
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,096
Are you mad?

190
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,733
No. I'm in love!

191
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:46,203
Sonja, honey,
stay right here.

192
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:48,071
I just have to go
to the bathroom.

193
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:49,206
Wait, Glenn.

194
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,242
Take this wine glass.
We can use it later.

195
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:54,177
(voice breaks):
My God, I...

196
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:56,046
I've never been so happy!

197
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:03,137
I'm telling you guys,
Sonja is the perfect woman.

198
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,740
She's every bit as kinky
and as insatiable as I am.

199
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:06,341
Really?

200
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,342
I thought you said she was
just some computer geek.

201
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:09,610
She is.

202
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,747
Her mouth has enough storage
space for a giggity-byte. Oh!

203
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,015
(text alert beeps)

204
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:16,050
Geez, you changed your
relationship status already?

205
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:17,618
When you know, you know.

206
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:19,420
All right, but just
be careful, ya know?

207
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:21,022
You don't wanna rush an
important decision.

208
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,423
I'll take
the cheeseburger meal.

209
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,525
Would you like to make it
an extra large meal?

210
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,095
Uh...

211
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:30,965
(insects chirring)

212
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,435
(thunder crashes)

213
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,870
(birds chirping)

214
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:37,705
(insects chirring)

215
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,540
(wind whistling)

216
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:41,075
(people screaming, shouting)

217
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,444
(explosion)

218
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,413
(people screaming, shouting)

219
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:46,948
(lasers zapping)

220
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:53,921
N-No. Yes.

221
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,089
No.

222
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:57,425
You sure? It's only
29 cents more.

223
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,659
Yes.

224
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:00,428
No.

225
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,834
What the hell?

226
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:10,905
Stewie, what are you doing
up here?

227
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,707
(gasps)
Brian!

228
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:13,908
It's not what you think!

229
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:15,877
All right, I came up here
for a photo shoot

230
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,845
and it just got way,
way out of hand!

231
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,980
You're having tea.

232
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:20,515
How is that
out of hand?

233
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:21,983
Is your shirt
on backwards?

234
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:24,619
Please! You can't tell Rupert
I was up here, all right?

235
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:26,320
He wouldn't understand.
He'll kill himself, Brian!

236
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:27,755
He's been through so much
already!

237
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,524
He can't take much more!

238
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,726
Brian, he watched
his brother drown!

239
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,960
Stewie, relax.

240
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:34,929
You're getting all
worked up over nothing.

241
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:36,564
Says the guy who freaks out

242
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:38,566
every time
a fire engine goes by.

243
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
(siren wails)

244
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,602
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

245
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:43,371
(howls)

246
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:46,741
Peter, Peter, you hear that?!
(howls)

247
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:50,878
I'm matching the sound!
(howls)

248
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:52,847
Is what I'm doing helping?

249
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:58,786
Glenn, why did you
bring me here?

250
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,021
Well, I've always had
this fantasy

251
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:01,556
of having sex on
the basketball court

252
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,057
in front of my
high school principal.

253
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:07,228
Only problem is he's
now completely senile.

254
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:09,764
Yeah, you like this,
Principal Goodrich, huh?

255
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:10,998
Remember you once
suspended me

256
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,533
for showing my wiener
in school?

257
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:13,901
I did?

258
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:16,270
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

259
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,206
I'm sorry, Sonja,
I don't think I can finish.

260
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,274
You never could finish,
Quagmire!

261
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,376
Donahue, get in there!

262
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:26,814
Okay, Glenn, now that we've
covered ourselves in black ink,

263
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:28,449
let's do it until
we've created

264
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:31,519
every character in
the Chinese alphabet.

265
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:43,297
When all said and done,

266
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,400
Quagmire body tell story
of sadness.

267
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:52,139
Wow, I can't even imagine
what twisted deviant act

268
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,774
you've thought of this time.

269
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,344
I want you to have sex
with your father.

270
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:57,845
What?!

271
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,580
Yep, and I'm gonna watch.

272
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:00,748
Hi, Glenn.

273
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:02,817
Are you crazy?! No!
No way!

274
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,419
Glenn, remember, the thing we love
most about each other

275
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,088
is that we push
each other

276
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:10,524
way beyond
our normal boundaries.

277
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,860
Did you enjoy your stay
at the Marriott?

278
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:14,695
No, I did not.

279
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,535
STEWIE: Oh, well, excuse me for not
being six months old anymore!

280
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,471
Oh, and here come
the tears!

281
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,207
The show is starting,
everyone! Come on down!

282
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:29,543
What's all that noise?

283
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:31,045
What the hell's
going on up there?

284
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,580
We're in a fight is
what's going on!

285
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:34,682
Brian, I need you to settle
an argument for us:

286
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:35,883
am I Hitler?

287
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:37,385
Because I don't think
that I am,

288
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,288
(chuckling) but maybe-maybe
I'm off base on this.

289
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:41,422
Stewie, take it easy.

290
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:42,456
No, you know what?

291
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:43,891
You may as well call
your family now

292
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,159
because I'm not going
to Sarasota.

293
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:46,894
I don't care
if we can't get a refund,

294
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:47,962
we're through!

295
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:49,096
Here, Brian, you take him.

296
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:50,364
Maybe you can make him happy.

297
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,666
What?
You heard me. Take him.

298
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,434
Do whatever you want
with him, I don't care.

299
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:54,702
Rupert and I are over!

300
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:55,770
Are you sure?

301
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:56,871
Yes, we're done.

302
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:58,339
I just hope we can
handle it better

303
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:00,308
than blue and yellow
did when they split up.

304
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:02,243
You were supposed to have
the kids here by 5:00.

305
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:03,344
We have plans.

306
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:04,478
It's 5:15.

307
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:05,947
Stop busting my hump, Alicia.

308
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,214
Okay, you know
what, let's not...

309
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,716
let's not do this
in front of the kids.

310
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,984
God, you're right.

311
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:11,218
What ever happened to us?

312
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,054
Hey, baby, you
ready for dinner?

313
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:14,221
What's up, Scott?

314
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,223
We gonna get
some barbecue.

315
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,594
Hey, guys.

316
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,363
No, indoors, not okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

317
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:23,831
Don't do it.
Nighttime, not allowed.

318
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:25,199
What? There's nothing
wrong with this.

319
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:27,101
No, no way, give me those.

320
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:29,704
Oh, my God.

321
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:31,105
Quagmire,
what the hell happened?

322
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,873
Is this another one
of those sex-related injuries

323
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:34,041
you keep getting?

324
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:35,376
Yeah, it seems like lately

325
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,845
that girlfriend of yours is
taking things a little too far.

326
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,947
No, she's not;
everything's great with us.

327
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:04,372
Are you guys still talking
about Sonja?

328
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:05,740
All right, I should
probably get going.

329
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:06,974
Sonja and I are supposed to go

330
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:09,643
to a "Brown Eyes
Wide Shut" party.

331
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,679
Geez, I don't know what's
going on with him.

332
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:13,748
But I guess love does
funny things to people.

333
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:15,116
Look at Forrest Gump.

334
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,384
Hi, Forrest.

335
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:19,020
I know you just got back
from Vietnam and you love me,

336
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:20,788
but I'm gonna go run a train

337
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:22,790
with this group
of Black Panthers I just met.

338
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:24,792
Okay, Jenny.

339
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,127
Hi, Forrest.

340
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:28,496
I know you came all this way
to New York to visit me,

341
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,663
but I'm gonna go do blow

342
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,499
and have sex
with a bunch of stockbrokers.

343
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,467
Okay, Jenny.

344
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,635
Hi, Forrest.

345
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:36,203
Now that I have
the most contagious

346
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:38,205
and incurable disease
known to mankind,

347
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,141
I'll finally have pity sex
with you.

348
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:41,976
Okay, Jenny.

349
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,346
And I'll mow the grass
and raise the AIDS baby.

350
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,683
SONJA:
Hey, sexy.

351
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:52,019
Sonja, what are you doing here?

352
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,655
Well, I got tired of waiting
for you to get home,

353
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:56,757
so I thought I'd come to you.

354
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:57,992
Come on, Sonja. How about...

355
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,460
how about
we take a night off, huh?

356
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:00,895
The sex has just been nonstop.

357
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:03,597
I mean, I understand
that "no" doesn't mean "no,"

358
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:06,000
but certainly some word
has got to mean "no."

359
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,138
This is one of your
fantasies, right?

360
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:13,307
Public humiliation?

361
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:15,943
Mm, it's sexy, isn't it?

362
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:18,379
(cries out)

363
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:19,814
(crying)
Sonja, stop, please!

364
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:22,283
Come on, you love it.

365
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:28,022
Ow! Ow! Ow!

366
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:30,558
You're hurting me, and I really
need to clean out my trunk!

367
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,359
Oh, I'm gonna clean
out your trunk.

368
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,561
Giggity.

369
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:34,695
That's my word.

370
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:36,097
That's my word!

371
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,431
(muffled screaming)

372
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:38,632
(engine starting)

373
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:43,537
Okay, Joe, Joe,
you're drunk, okay?

374
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,573
You're drunk;
give me your keys.

375
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,942
And-and I'm drunk,
so I'll give you my keys.

376
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:51,078
Okay, now we're both good
to drive home.

377
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,951
You been drinking tonight, sir?

378
00:13:56,985 --> 00:14:00,721
Uh, no, Officer, I just had
a glass of dinner with my wine.

379
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:02,990
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car

380
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:05,326
and walk a straight
line, please.

381
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,728
All right, you be safe, sir.

382
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:09,864
There's a lot of crazies
out there tonight.

383
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,002
(doorbell rings)

384
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,601
Oh, hey, Mr. and
Mrs. Quagmire.

385
00:14:19,636 --> 00:14:20,702
Hi, Peter.

386
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:22,104
I'm a little worried
about Glenn.

387
00:14:22,138 --> 00:14:23,772
I haven't heard
from him in days.

388
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:24,940
Have you seen him?

389
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:26,108
I haven't seen anybody.

390
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:27,910
I've been grounded
for pinching a girl.

391
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:30,045
Hey, are you guys talking
about Quagmire?

392
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,647
He never showed
this morning,

393
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:34,349
and today's the day
we usually go apple picking.

394
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:35,784
Get that one.

395
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:36,952
Get that one!

396
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:38,287
Hey, get that one.

397
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:39,621
Get that one over there.

398
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:41,356
No, not-not that one.

399
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:42,958
I already got it!
I can't put it back!

400
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:44,393
Well, it's not
going in the pie.

401
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,128
Well, if you're so smart,
why don't you come up here

402
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:47,329
and pick them yourself?

403
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:49,464
And now there's
no pie at all.

404
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:50,966
I've already checked
Glenn's house,

405
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,634
and there's no sign
he's even been there.

406
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:54,536
I'm afraid something terrible
has happened.

407
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,338
Now let's not jump
to any conclusions.

408
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm sure if we just check
his usual hangouts,

409
00:14:58,274 --> 00:14:59,841
someone will have seen him.

410
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:00,976
Wait a second.

411
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,045
He hangs out at the Clam
with some fat loudmouth.

412
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,480
You find Loudy McFatass,
you find Quagmire.

413
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:06,715
Come on, let's go.

414
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:08,817
But Dad, it's the
night of my big show.

415
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:12,487
Oh, Chris, I was never
gonna go to that.

416
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,759
We should get some food
in you, mister.

417
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:19,594
You hardly ate
any of that cereal

418
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:21,029
I smashed
on your mouth yesterday.

419
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:22,564
(gasps)
Brian?

420
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:24,366
Oh, hey.

421
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,801
What the hell are you doing?

422
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:28,270
Oh, I've been kind of using
Rupert as a chew toy.

423
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:29,705
Chewing him
with your crotch?

424
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:31,406
Hey, dogs like humping
stuffed animals.

425
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,507
What can I say?

426
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,076
Besides, you said
I could have Rupert.

427
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,744
I thought you liked
Oscar better anyway.

428
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:37,245
Well, I just changed my mind.

429
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,815
And you know Rupert's a dude,
right, you gaylord?

430
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:45,087
Okay, you guys, where should
we start looking for Glenn?

431
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:46,989
Well, sometimes Quagmire
likes to hang out

432
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:48,790
under all the clutter
in my garage.

433
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,993
So, why don't we
just start sorting stuff

434
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:52,527
and throwing stuff away

435
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:53,829
but obviously checking
with me first

436
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:55,063
before you throw stuff away.

437
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:56,431
No problem, Peter.

438
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,800
Quagmire, if you're in
there, hang tight, buddy.

439
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,035
We're coming.

440
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:01,803
Right, and if we can't
find him in here,

441
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:03,171
he sometimes likes to hang out

442
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:05,040
in between the blades
of grass in my lawn.

443
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:07,542
And also, in the firewood
that needs to be split.

444
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:09,544
Might he be under the leaves
in your gutter?

445
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:10,912
Great question,
and yes, he might.

446
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:12,781
So, while you guys
are taking care of that,

447
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,683
I'll be around back
flicking pinecones

448
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:16,551
at a tree
with this hockey stick.

449
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:23,125
Aloha.
Welcome to Ryan's Hawaiians.

450
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,526
Hey, how you doing?

451
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,594
Amazing.

452
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:26,995
Have you seen this man?

453
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,330
Glenn Quagmire?

454
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:30,832
Nah, the last time I saw him
was three months ago.

455
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:32,701
Sold him 70 red shirts.

456
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:34,603
Yeah, he does look
good in that shirt.

457
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:36,738
Uh, everyone looks good
in my shirts.

458
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:38,140
How about you, Big Island?

459
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:39,508
Uh, I don't know.

460
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,176
Do you want to be
an oldies' DJ

461
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,878
or a 1980's wrestling manager?

462
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:44,413
Yes, both.

463
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,782
This is beautiful.

464
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:48,450
Heart disease looks better

465
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:50,919
when it's wrapped in a
tropical, floral pattern.

466
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:55,791
Oh, my God, this is hopeless.

467
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:57,659
We've been searching for hours.

468
00:16:57,693 --> 00:16:59,261
Glenn could be dead by now.

469
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:01,129
I know, and if you guys
are really hungry,

470
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:02,264
I suppose I could eat.

471
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:03,498
Come on, we can't give up.

472
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:05,300
Someone's got to
have seen Quagmire.

473
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:06,902
Or if not him,
at least Sonja.

474
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:08,904
Excuse me, did you
just say "Sonja"?

475
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:10,038
Yes! I did!

476
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:11,373
That was my dog's name.

477
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:13,675
Excuse me,
did he just say "Sonja"?

478
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:14,943
Yeah, it was his dog's name.

479
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:16,945
Oh, I thought
he might have been talking

480
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:19,019
about this super kinky woman
who's always down here,

481
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:21,049
trying to lure men
to her sex slave shed.

482
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:22,951
No, I think he was talking
about his dog.

483
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:25,220
No, Peter, that's the
Sonja we're looking for.

484
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:27,222
Sonja must have
taken Glenn there.

485
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,890
Where exactly is
this sex slave shed?

486
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:30,092
I'm not sure,

487
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:32,227
but I've heard she has a unit
at Quahog Storage.

488
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,463
Apparently that chick's
a complete psycho.

489
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:35,730
We got to get over there!

490
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,499
Come on, you guys, let's go!

491
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:40,001
Oh, man, I hope we don't catch
them doing something freaky.

492
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:41,870
I'm still weirded out
from when I walked in

493
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:43,572
on that masturbating Eskimo.

494
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:45,841
Dinner time, Tikaloo.

495
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,142
Oh, my God!

496
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:48,877
Doesn't anybody knock?

497
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:55,016
Hey, Stewie, look, I want
to apologize about earlier.

498
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:56,685
What the hell is this?

499
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:59,488
Brian, I think it's time
that Rupert made his choice.

500
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:00,722
What are you talking about?

501
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:02,124
Talking about love, Bri.

502
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:03,692
Talking about adult decisions.

503
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:05,827
Rupert's been with me,
and now he's been with you.

504
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:07,496
It's time for him to pick.

505
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,564
Stewie, this is stupid;
I'm not doing this.

506
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,101
Brian, either you cooperate or I
blow my Adam Levine dog whistle.

507
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:15,003
Hey, my voice isn't that high.

508
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:16,104
It is.

509
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:17,472
It is though.

510
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:18,640
All right, Rupert.

511
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:19,708
Who will it be?

512
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:20,809
And before you answer,

513
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:22,878
think of all the
good times we've had.

514
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:25,247
The time we met The Beatles
on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show,</i>

515
00:18:25,281 --> 00:18:27,916
that winter we lived
on the sun,

516
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,284
and here's my favorite.

517
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:32,120
A blank one we can fill up

518
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:34,489
with a future together.

519
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:41,596
Yes!

520
00:18:41,631 --> 00:18:44,032
Oh, my God, Rupert, I'm
so sorry for everything!

521
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,400
I missed you, too!

522
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:46,768
Whatever.

523
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:48,803
Hey, you done
with that weird octopus doll?

524
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:52,607
It's you and me forever, Rupert.

525
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:55,410
I just hope Oscar
didn't take it too hard.

526
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,154
This is it, number 92.

527
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,756
This is Sonja's storage unit.

528
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,925
Quagmire, are you in there?

529
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,826
(muffles screaming)

530
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:13,195
Oh, he's eating.

531
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:15,530
We'll come back
when you're done eating.

532
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:23,038
Glenn!

533
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:24,272
Hurry, she'll be back soon.

534
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:26,374
I can't believe the
guy with the ponytail

535
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:28,009
and the facial tattoo
at the front desk

536
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:29,244
would let this happen.

537
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:30,946
SONJA:
Well, what's this?

538
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,681
We got company?

539
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:34,049
Hold it right there.

540
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,183
Please.

541
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:37,052
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

542
00:19:37,086 --> 00:19:38,420
Boy, if you were
ever gonna stand,

543
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:40,488
this would be
the time, Joe.

544
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:42,023
Everybody, just shut up!

545
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:45,026
You idiots should've
minded your own business.

546
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:46,161
This is our business.

547
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:47,629
You kidnapped our friend.

548
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:49,164
You're going to jail.

549
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:51,066
Don't come any closer
or I'll shoot you.

550
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,034
Oh, I don't think
you're gonna shoot me.

551
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:54,469
You don't got the boobs.

552
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:55,570
What?

553
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:56,671
I-I don't know.

554
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:58,740
Now, just hand me
the gun, Sonja.

555
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:00,942
Oh, I swear to God,
you get one inch closer to me,

556
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:02,077
and I'm gonna shoot you.

557
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:06,881
(gun clicking)

558
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,183
What the hell?

559
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,319
Like I said, you're
going to jail.

560
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:13,088
Oh, my God, Joe,
that was so close.

561
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:14,623
How'd you know the
gun would jam?

562
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:16,024
It didn't jam, Peter.

563
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:17,259
The gun was never loaded.

564
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:19,561
Sort of had
a mental breakdown in April.

565
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,696
No more bullets for this guy.

566
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:23,832
Oh, Glenn, I was so
worried about you.

567
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,867
Are you all right?
No, no,

568
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,203
I'm pretty (bleep) far
from all right.

569
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:30,538
Well, I guess this is
as good a time as any.

570
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:32,474
Happy birthday, Joe.

571
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:33,908
You dick!

572
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:38,847
Thanks for your help, guys.

573
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:40,561
I might not be alive
if it weren't for you.

574
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,050
Hey, no problem, buddy.

575
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:44,219
Yeah, you'd have done the
same for us, Quagmire.

576
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:45,920
You know, I guess
what I realized from all this

577
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:47,717
is that when it comes
to relationships,

578
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:49,019
I need to be the kinky one.

579
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,385
Ah, we're just glad
to have you back, Quagmire.

580
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,241
Yep, and it's good to put
all those troubles behind us.

581
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:57,491
My dad told me
he's pregnant.
