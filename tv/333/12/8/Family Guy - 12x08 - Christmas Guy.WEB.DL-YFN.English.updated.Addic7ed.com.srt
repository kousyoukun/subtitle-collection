12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,399
We now return to
<i>Home Alone with Competent Robbers.</i>

13
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:45,807
Hey, be careful. There's
cars on the floor here.

14
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,608
Thanks.
That's weird?

15
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:49,177
Yeah. The doorknob
was really hot,

16
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:51,612
but I just let go instead
of holding onto it.

17
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:53,881
And there's some ice
on the stairs to the basement,

18
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,417
so I guess just don't go down there.

19
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:58,686
Just so you guys know, I have a tarantula.

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,024
Well, now there are no witnesses.

21
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:05,526
Come on, everybody, let's go to the mall.

22
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:07,595
It's time for the Christmas Carnival.

23
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:09,864
It's Stewie's first Christmas.

24
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:11,065
Again?

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,102
I love the Christmas Carnival!

26
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:15,269
Chris, calm down.

27
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:16,938
You're giving yourself a nosebleed.

28
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:18,806
You know, the best thing
about the Quahog Mall

29
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:21,409
is going into Tiffany's
and doing everything possible

30
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:23,711
to make 'em think I might
actually buy something.

31
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:26,080
Oh, this is lovely.
Just lovely.

32
00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:27,248
How much is this?

33
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:28,683
$1,200.

34
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:29,984
Great, great.

35
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:32,286
That's all? A-And how late
are you open this evening?

36
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:33,287
Until 7:00.

37
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:34,355
Perfect, perfect.

38
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:36,218
And you accept credit cards and cash?

39
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:36,967
Yes.

40
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:37,793
And what's your name?

41
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,032
I want to make sure you
get credit for this sale.

42
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:42,196
Evan.
Oh, that's a great name.

43
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:43,631
Oh, and these watches here,

44
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:46,100
if I wanted to get 11 of them
for different groomsmen,

45
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:48,117
could they each get engraved individually?

46
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:48,870
Yes.

47
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,571
And you do that on site?
Yes.

48
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:54,609
Fantastic. Now, the groomsmen's
names are Blake, Hayden, Edgar,

49
00:01:54,643 --> 00:01:57,979
Blake D., Elliott,
Milo, Cooper...

50
00:01:58,013 --> 00:01:59,653
Why aren't you writing any of these down?

51
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:02,250
You're wearing Sbarro
wrappers for shoes, sir.

52
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:05,920
There <i>may</i> have been a trade.

53
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:15,630
Hey, nice outfit.

54
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:17,899
Fancy pair of shoes, too.

55
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:20,735
Do you, do you only use
adjectives sarcastically?

56
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,871
Great question, smart guy.

57
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:25,740
What the hell?
Where's all the decorations?

58
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:27,074
And the big Christmas tree?

59
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:28,109
Oh, look, there's Santa.

60
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:29,277
Peter, no.

61
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:30,778
That's a Hells Angel.

62
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:31,779
What do you want?

63
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:32,680
Meth?

64
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:33,714
Okay.

65
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,883
There's no Christmas Carnival, Dad.

66
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,385
You seem to know a lot about this, Meg.

67
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:38,352
What did you do?

68
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:40,188
No Christmas Carnival?

69
00:02:40,222 --> 00:02:41,622
Whoever is responsible for this

70
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:43,257
shall suffer my eternal wrath.

71
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:44,959
Who's this guy?

72
00:02:44,993 --> 00:02:46,460
Tough don't sell
in curly-toed shoes.

73
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:47,995
Leave me alone.

74
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,865
Why don't you go bother
the cologne salesman at Macy's?

75
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,567
I want something I can wear on the street

76
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:55,303
that a broad can smell on a fire escape.

77
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:57,605
There's gotta be an explanation for this.

78
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,906
Let's ask that security guard

79
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,908
who has everything on
his belt except a gun.

80
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:02,843
E-Excuse me, sir?

81
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:03,945
It's "officer."

82
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:06,214
No, it's not.
It's barely "sir."

83
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:07,381
Yeah, I know.

84
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,417
Where is the Christmas Carnival?

85
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:11,085
Canceled.
I don't know why.

86
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:13,387
I'm just a small cog in this operation.

87
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:14,689
You hear that, Dad?

88
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:17,325
You're not the only one
around here with a small cog.

89
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:20,161
I told you that in confidence, Chris.

90
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,129
Daddy, where's Santa?

91
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:24,031
Was he killed by Muslims?

92
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,967
Oh, my God, poor Stewie.

93
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:27,802
He's so disappointed.

94
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:29,971
Of course he is, Lois.
I feel the same way.

95
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:31,772
How come every time I'm feelin' happy,

96
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:33,641
somebody's gotta come along and ruin it?

97
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:36,377
Are you enjoying your coffee, sir?

98
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:38,312
Yeah, it's very
smooth. Good flavor.

99
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:41,515
What if we told you that
we secretly replaced your coffee

100
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,817
with Folgers Crystals?

101
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:44,352
Wouldn't you feel like a dumb-ass?

102
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:46,420
'Cause of how you just
raved about it just now?

103
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:48,489
You stupid son of a bitch.

104
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:57,131
Boy, Stewie was really upset

105
00:03:57,165 --> 00:03:59,433
about the Christmas
Carnival being canceled.

106
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:00,768
He's been acting out all week.

107
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:02,970
I'm sure he'll be over it in no time.

108
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:05,439
Besides, how much trouble
can he cause? He's a baby.

109
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:19,687
We now return to <i>Miracle on 134th Street.</i>

110
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:22,523
Oh, my God, I left my phone in my car.

111
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:25,126
Wow, it's still there.

112
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,801
Hey, I've been askin' around
about this carnival thing.

113
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:35,836
Turns out I know a guy who knows a guy

114
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:37,805
who knows another guy who knows a girl,

115
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,274
which is weird because they
don't usually know nothin',

116
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,777
who says the carnival was
canceled by the mall's owner,

117
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:44,412
some guy named Carter Pewterschmidt.

118
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:45,813
Oh, my God.

119
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:48,749
So I got another guy workin'
on findin' out who that is.

120
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:49,984
It's my father.

121
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,953
Oh! This is a twist
I did not expect.

122
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:56,190
Oh! Excuse me, I'm just gonna
have to "Oh" this out

123
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:58,192
until I'm not surprised anymore.

124
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:00,728
Oh! Oh! Oh.

125
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:03,998
Oh... Oh. Oh.

126
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:05,800
Lois, before I get mad at your dad,

127
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,601
h-he isn't the Little
Caesars guy, is he?

128
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:08,997
No, Peter, we've been through this.

129
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:10,971
Good. I could never
be mad at that guy.

130
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,940
He says my favorite word twice in a row.

131
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:14,642
Now, I'm gonna go talk to your father

132
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:16,610
and get him to bring back
the Christmas Carnival.

133
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:18,206
Peter, I don't think that's gonna work.

134
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:19,647
Sure, it will.

135
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:21,916
The nerve of your dad, takin'
the fun out of Christmas,

136
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,085
like some kind of
gluten-free Santa.

137
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:26,554
Hey. Hey,
what's in these?

138
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:29,890
I'm okay if it's, like, coconut flour.

139
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:32,493
But anything with actual
grains, I can't do.

140
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:33,761
I'm not sure.

141
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:36,130
Well, who <i>is</i> sure?

142
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,275
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
there's a man here

143
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,945
who says he's the guy whose
picture is on all the money.

144
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,480
Holy cow. Send him in.

145
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:55,249
Griffin.

146
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:57,852
That's right, and this is my
own <i>People</i> magazine from home

147
00:05:57,886 --> 00:05:59,520
and not from your waiting room just now,

148
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:01,422
and why did you cancel
the Christmas Carnival?

149
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:02,890
Because I hate Christmas.

150
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:05,226
You know what it's like being
rich at Christmas, Griffin?

151
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,696
Everyone expects an expensive
present, and I get nothing.

152
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,499
Did you... did you just have
your hand in my fish tank?

153
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:12,767
No.

154
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:13,961
Sheesh, Carter, you know what?

155
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:16,103
I am gonna help you find
the Christmas spirit

156
00:06:16,138 --> 00:06:17,471
so you bring back the carnival.

157
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:18,639
Look, are we done here?

158
00:06:18,673 --> 00:06:20,174
Um, yeah, just one more thing.

159
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,977
Can I choose one thing in your office
to take home with me?

160
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,245
No.

161
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,915
Aw, too bad. 'Cause I
was gonna choose you.

162
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:30,351
You're weird.
You're a weird guy.

163
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,200
No. No-no, no.

164
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:40,401
I want to zip it.

165
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,541
It's okay, Peter,
you're good at other stuff.

166
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,076
So you're gonna help your old man

167
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,944
find his Christmas spirit again?

168
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,746
Oh, yeah, that sounds real bad,

169
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,681
her father don't like Christmas.

170
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:55,850
My father was drowned
to death in a birdbath

171
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:57,585
by an officer of the law.

172
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,720
His will just said,

173
00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:01,089
"Kick Jimmy in the sack
for me. Go, Eagles."

174
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:02,523
My sympathies, Vinny.

175
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:04,759
Don't worry about it, he was a scumbag.

176
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:06,394
Are you sure about this, Peter?

177
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:08,463
I mean, I know Stewie was disappointed

178
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:10,365
about the carnival, but he'll get over it.

179
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,066
He's a happy, resilient baby.

180
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:13,334
I don't know, Lois.

181
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:14,969
I feel like if we don't do something,

182
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,325
Stewie's first words are gonna be,

183
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:17,672
"Why did you
kill Christmas?"

184
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:19,240
And I want the carnival back, too.

185
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:21,709
You know, I know I'm usually
all business, but deep down,

186
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:23,911
you know what the thing
is that keeps me going

187
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:24,946
more than anything else?

188
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,247
Wonder.

189
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:28,216
A sense of wonder.

190
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,485
Well, you have your work
cut out for you, Peter.

191
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,354
My father's always hated Christmas.

192
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,523
Hey, happy June 16.

193
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:37,592
Thought I'd see how
you like it when someone

194
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:40,194
breaks into your house
and touches all your stuff.

195
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:41,696
Hey. Knock it off.

196
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,631
I'm touching this.
And this over here.

197
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,733
You're a creep, is my point.

198
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,338
All right, Carter, now,
you know what's guaranteed

199
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:51,773
to put you in the holiday mood?

200
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,840
Write a Christmas letter

201
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,509
to all your friends and relatives.

202
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,644
And keep in mind,
it's traditional to embellish

203
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,413
a little bit to make yourself look better.

204
00:07:58,447 --> 00:07:59,881
"Peter had a great year,

205
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:01,549
"and is now starting quarterback

206
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,584
for the Jacksonville
Jaguars."

207
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,853
What? People can easily
fact-check this.

208
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:07,655
Yeah, who has the time?
Keep reading.

209
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,791
"Chris refurbished a vintage motorcycle,

210
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:11,592
"and Stewie can
slam-dunk a basketball

211
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,294
from a standing
start..."

212
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:14,629
Peter, that's impossible.

213
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,064
Read what it says about you.

214
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:17,999
"Lois's father, Carter Pewterschmidt,

215
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,801
bought a small stool
for his balls."

216
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:21,235
Damn it, I'm not proud of that.

217
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,171
Well, you have to
throw in some real facts.

218
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:25,573
That's what gives
the newsletter credibility.

219
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:29,977
Now, everyone knows the best way
to get the Christmas spirit

220
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:32,914
is to drink a whole lot
of thick, frothy eggnog.

221
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:33,748
So get going.

222
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:34,782
I don't like eggnog.

223
00:08:34,817 --> 00:08:35,850
Drink the nog, Carter.

224
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:37,318
I don't... I don't want to.

225
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,721
Take it, Carter.
Take all the nog.

226
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:43,458
No.

227
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:44,826
Yeah, you like that nog.

228
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,194
Don't spit the nog out.

229
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:48,296
Now look at the camera for a POV shot.

230
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,465
Say thank you with the nog in your mouth.

231
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:51,566
Thank you.
Louder.

232
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you.

233
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:55,369
Good, now go down
to the hotel lobby and check out

234
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:56,637
with nog all over your face.

235
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:57,705
All right.

236
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,674
You know, I still don't like Christmas,

237
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,976
but I kind of like what we just did.

238
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:06,581
Okay, Carter, a big part
of Christmas is masturbating

239
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:08,916
like you would any other day
but feeling guilty about it

240
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:10,585
because it's Christmas.

241
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:18,693
What's wrong with me?

242
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:19,694
Griffin, this isn't working.

243
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:20,895
What? What do you mean?

244
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,463
I-I'm not getting
the holiday spirit,

245
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:23,631
so you can stop trying.

246
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:25,166
But Carter, it's not just for me.

247
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,501
Think about Stewie.

248
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:28,369
He's all upset 'cause there's no carnival.

249
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:29,771
Heh.
Different dog.

250
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:31,706
Yeah, this one's, like,
Italian or something.

251
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,107
Anyway, I think we're done here.

252
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:34,575
No Christmas Carnival.

253
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,044
Wow, Carter. I had no
idea you were Jewish.

254
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,280
What? Is... is that
how this is coming off?

255
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:40,548
Yeah, kind of.

256
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:41,949
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

257
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:43,618
People think I'm Jewish?

258
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,332
Oh, this Christmas Carnival
has everything. Games, food.

259
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,935
Oh, my God, it's the carolers
from <i>A Christmas Story.</i>

260
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:04,772
♪ Deck the harrs with boughs of horry ♪

261
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:08,442
♪ Fa ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ♪

262
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,278
That's right, America, don't forget.

263
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:13,214
Your beloved holiday movie
is incredibly racist.

264
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:15,283
And flom not that rong ago.

265
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,951
What's wrong with you, Stews?

266
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:18,886
You're next up to see the big guy himself

267
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:21,322
and you look like a piece
of spaghetti on the street.

268
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:23,324
I don't know. I thought
having the carnival back

269
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:24,559
would make me happy,

270
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:26,661
but it still feels like
something's missing.

271
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,462
Yeah, it's always somethin'.

272
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,765
Like when I finally got
to sleep with Mary Lou Gallo.

273
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,067
She had a look, but when you got up close,

274
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:34,936
she also had a smell.

275
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,938
Oh, Stewie, you're next.

276
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:38,906
Ho ho ho.

277
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,441
Mall Santa is brought to you

278
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:42,610
in part this season by Chipotle.

279
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:45,479
Between good and garbage, it's Chipotle.

280
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,415
So, what do you want for Christmas?

281
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,350
Oh, what do I want for Christmas?

282
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:51,652
What <i>do</i> I want for Christmas?

283
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,528
You know what I want for Christmas?

284
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:02,396
I want my friend back.

285
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:03,631
Your friend?

286
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:05,066
Yes. My best friend.

287
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,901
My dog, Brian.

288
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:08,536
He's dead.

289
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,705
It's our first Christmas without him

290
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:13,441
and no one's even mentioned his name.

291
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:18,179
I don't care about this stupid
carnival or Christmas.

292
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:20,781
I don't care about anything except Brian.

293
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:24,085
I want Brian.

294
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:28,789
You want me to put a
dead dog under your tree?

295
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:30,725
Yes.

296
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:35,796
And,

297
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:37,598
I-I'd like
a bike, too.

298
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:47,530
We now return to <i>The Year</i>
<i>Without a Santa Claus or Sex.</i>

299
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:48,731
Daddy, where's Santa Clau...

300
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:49,866
I don't know, okay?!

301
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,201
Should I ask Mom?

302
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:54,604
I don't know, she's so busy with her job.

303
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:57,006
Hello there, Stewart.

304
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,975
What's this?
What are you doing, Vinny?

305
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,543
Vinny? Who's Vinny?

306
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:04,147
My name is Brian, aka your favorite dog.

307
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,015
Hey, whose leg do you gotta gagoosh

308
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,618
to get an Amaretto Di Saronno around here?

309
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:10,486
Oh, forget it, Vinny.
You're not Brian.

310
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,422
Come on, I went through a lot of trouble.

311
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:15,525
For example, I know Brian
was rather into politics,

312
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,993
so I read the newspaper.

313
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,096
What is goin' on with all these politics?

314
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,732
Well, that is about Brian's
level of political awareness.

315
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:24,234
Yeah, and you know how Brian wrote

316
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:25,468
<i>Wish It, Want It, Do It?</i>

317
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:26,936
Well, I wrote a book, too.

318
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:28,037
A little something called

319
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:29,472
<i>Wish It, Want It, You Blew It.</i>

320
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:30,640
Really?

321
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:33,543
Yup. Let me read
you an expert.

322
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:35,278
"You wish you were a millionaire.

323
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,480
"You want more money.
Guess what.

324
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:38,615
"You blew it.

325
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,383
"You wish you could
change the neighborhood.

326
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,418
"You want to be a selectman.

327
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:43,620
"You blew it.

328
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:45,488
"You wish you could open up a restaurant.

329
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:47,490
"You did not want to pay protection money.

330
00:12:47,524 --> 00:12:48,658
"Knock, knock.
Who's there?

331
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:49,792
You blew it."

332
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:50,927
You blew it who?

333
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:52,061
You blew it bad.

334
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,264
You know what the last
page of the book is?

335
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:56,799
A mirror. So you can see
exactly who blew it.

336
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:57,934
Being you.

337
00:12:57,968 --> 00:12:59,769
Look, I appreciate all this, Vinny,

338
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:02,005
but there's only one Brian,

339
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,607
and it's tough for me that he's gone,

340
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:07,343
especially around the holidays.

341
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:09,646
Okay, I know what'll cheer you up.

342
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,115
How about you open up one
of those Christmas presents?

343
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:13,316
It's from me.

344
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,351
Merry Christmas.

345
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,620
What the hell?
There's a foot in this box.

346
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:19,722
That was supposed to go to somebody else.

347
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,057
I'm very sorry.

348
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,325
Well, my friends,

349
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,994
I think Johnny "The Foot"
Giatelli is dead.

350
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:26,162
Oh no.

351
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,765
They killed Frankie
"Choo-Choo" Chinelli instead.

352
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,133
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

353
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,834
You sure that's what this means?

354
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:34,304
Could be they killed
Davey "The Box" Frateli.

355
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:35,505
- Ooh. - Ooh.
- Ooh.

356
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:37,140
Hold on, it could also be

357
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:39,642
they killed Jimmy "Tissue Paper" Scungili.

358
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:42,478
I just saw Jimmy yesterday
at my kid's christening.

359
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:44,047
So maybe it wasn't Jimmy.

360
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,248
Maybe this means they killed

361
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,050
Anthony "The Air Around the Box" Minetti.

362
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,752
Oh, no, they killed

363
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,654
Sal "Holding The Box
That We Can't Figure Out

364
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:53,823
What The Box Means" Casella.

365
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:55,925
Here, I got this for you, too.

366
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,194
A bowling shirt?

367
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:59,529
You can wear it anywhere.

368
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:01,464
To the beach, a wedding on the beach,

369
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:04,000
beach graduation, beach funeral,

370
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:06,469
business conference
which could be at a beach,

371
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:07,603
a stroll through the park,

372
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,772
should that park be adjacent to a beach.

373
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,940
Thanks.

374
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,408
What, you don't like it?

375
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:13,910
How's about we go to the mall

376
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:15,445
and pick out something you do like?

377
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,814
Well, I suppose
I could browse the toy store.

378
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:19,682
Possibly pick up a new action figure.

379
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:21,184
That's the spirit.

380
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:23,338
All right, I better get out
of these professor clothes

381
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:25,355
before I kick my own ass.

382
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:32,428
Okay, Stewie.
Pick anything you want, on me.

383
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:35,264
I don't know. I hate the toy
store this close to Christmas.

384
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:36,866
It's always been picked clean.

385
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,534
There's plenty of good stuff here.

386
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,537
Look at this, heavy bronze sheep bookends.

387
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:43,973
What kid wouldn't want to play with these?

388
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,675
"Baa. What are
you lookin' at?"

389
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,744
"Not much, that's
what I'm lookin' at."

390
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:49,012
"You want to have a go?"

391
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:50,146
"I'd watch what I say

392
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,215
with that other sheep
right behind you."

393
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,584
I played this as a kid.

394
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:56,619
Course, I had to do it with ashtrays,

395
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:58,254
but I think the sheep is better.

396
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,891
Wait a minute.
Who is that?

397
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:09,132
I think... I think
I know that boy.

398
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:25,381
Vinny, that stocking cap.

399
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,582
It's mine.

400
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:30,286
That boy is me.

401
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,822
Of course.
It's me from the past.

402
00:15:32,856 --> 00:15:34,991
Several months ago,
I time-traveled ahead

403
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:36,526
to purchase that Christmas toy.

404
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,694
I don't understand, so
I'm angry and hungry.

405
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,530
I'm gonna go punch a sandwich.

406
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,900
Wow, good timing, little fella.

407
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:45,201
This just came out today.

408
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,937
Yeah, I kind of knew that already.

409
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:50,406
The time machine return pad
is in the backpack

410
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:51,841
that other Stewie is wearing.

411
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,709
I must get my hands on it, Vinny.

412
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,944
Vinny?

413
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:56,813
That was a tough sandwich.

414
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:58,481
As tough as your mom's fat face.

415
00:15:58,515 --> 00:15:59,916
Hey, leave my mother out of this.

416
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,251
That woman stitched gloves
till she was 90.

417
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:04,287
I heard she was good with her hands.

418
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:05,521
Nice.

419
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:08,024
Hey, everybody, we got
a funny sandwich here.

420
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:11,227
Vinny, I need you to get that Stewie

421
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,562
to take off his backpack.

422
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,263
Listen, Stewie, I'm not following.

423
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:15,531
I don't have time to explain.

424
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:16,766
I've got to steal something...

425
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,568
That's it. You've
already explained.

426
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,403
You got to steal
something. Got it.

427
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,971
Wait-Wait a sec,
what's your plan?

428
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:23,840
Trust me, I think I know you well enough

429
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,541
to know how to distract the other you.

430
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,547
Hey, how you doing?

431
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:33,783
This may sound a little
presumptuous of me,

432
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:36,219
but, you ever do any modeling?

433
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:37,453
Well, not professionally,

434
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:39,122
but I-I-I have
thought about it.

435
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:40,323
You ought to.

436
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:42,792
What are you, like,
six-three? Six-four?

437
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:44,827
Y-Y-You're in...
you're in the ballpark.

438
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:46,329
I-I-I carry
myself taller.

439
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:47,997
Good posture, very important.

440
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:49,499
Oh, I agree.

441
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,134
Let me see, let me see.

442
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:54,637
That's good.

443
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:56,105
But I feel like that backpack

444
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,907
might be hiding some figure flaws.

445
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:02,178
Well, that is where
you are wrong, my friend.

446
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:08,751
You know, my friends ask me,

447
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:11,187
"Stewie, why do you throw up
after every meal?"

448
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,555
This.

449
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,856
This is why.

450
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,661
All right, whatever
you gotta do, do it quick.

451
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,196
The other you is in the back

452
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,598
changing into a pair of
tap shoes, for some reason.

453
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:24,867
♪ Animal crackers
in my soup... ♪

454
00:17:24,902 --> 00:17:26,269
Hey, where did that guy go?

455
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:29,038
Excellent. Now all I've got
to do is set the coordinates

456
00:17:29,072 --> 00:17:30,573
to the moment before Brian got killed

457
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:31,707
and I can save him.

458
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:34,010
Oh, yeah, Scott Bakula and all that.

459
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:35,678
Yes, Vinny.
Scott Bakula.

460
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,947
Well, thank you for everything.

461
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:39,148
You bet.

462
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,084
You realize if I save Brian,

463
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,920
my family won't get another dog,

464
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:46,422
which means we will never have met.

465
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:49,225
I'll probably never see you again.

466
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:51,561
Oh.

467
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:54,830
So, I think this is good-bye.

468
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,166
Hey, I'm man's best friend,

469
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,635
not some stupid baby's best friend, right?

470
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:11,714
Good dog, Vinny.
Good dog.

471
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:14,584
Georgette, I'm coming home.

472
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,385
Who the hell is Georgette?

473
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:21,591
Okay, Brian, I'm just
putting this out there,

474
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,760
but I'm a baby and only dicks
don't let babies win.

475
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:26,362
God, look at this day?

476
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,397
You know, usually, I'd be
sitting inside writing,

477
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:30,333
you'd be working on one of your machines.

478
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,034
But here we are enjoying it.

479
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,869
Yes, it is a nice change of pace.

480
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,738
Oh, wait, I gotta go grab my knee pads.

481
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:38,507
I was using them for...
for, for this other thing.

482
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,076
Anyway, I-I'll be
right back.

483
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:48,951
Brian, look out!

484
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:52,321
What the hell?

485
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:54,957
You're alive, my friend.

486
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:56,025
What?
Course I'm alive.

487
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,293
What the hell's going on here?

488
00:18:57,327 --> 00:18:59,028
Brian, that car killed you.

489
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:02,365
And when it did, a little
part of me died as well.

490
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:03,599
I couldn't live without you.

491
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:06,035
So I came back from the future
to save your life.

492
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:07,436
Whoa. Wait,
wait a minute.

493
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:08,604
What are you talking about?

494
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:10,079
I saw you destroy your time machine.

495
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,341
Yes, but luckily, I ran into
another me from the past,

496
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:14,510
so I stole his return pad
and came back here.

497
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:15,811
Oh, that reminds me.

498
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:17,847
I've gotta send this back
where it came from.

499
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,687
I'm starting to think that guy

500
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,255
wasn't a real modeling agent.

501
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,024
And I'm starting to think that other guy

502
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:30,259
wasn't a real
penis-butt inspector.

503
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,763
Wow, Stewie, thank you for saving my life.

504
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,531
You know, a whole lot of other families

505
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:37,566
would've just gotten a
different dog and moved on.

506
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:39,769
Oh, oh, we could, we could never

507
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,804
do something like that, Brian.

508
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:44,040
Stewie, what's happening to you?

509
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:46,942
I think... My time line
is being erased.

510
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,879
The time line where
you died no longer exists.

511
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,982
Merry Christmas, Brian.

512
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:55,785
Hey, who were you talking to out here?

513
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,921
A pretty awesome guy.

514
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:00,022
Oh, "pretty awesome guy."

515
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:01,290
Why don't you marry him?

516
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,325
All right, game on.

517
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,360
Aah!

518
00:20:04,394 --> 00:20:07,330
Stew-S-A.
Stew-S-A. Stew-S-A.

519
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,039
Oven mitts.
Wow, thanks, Mom.

520
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:18,507
Now you don't have to ask me

521
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:21,243
if everything is hot before you touch it.

522
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:24,280
Are... are
the oven mitts hot?

523
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:26,916
Here you go, Stewie.
Merry Christmas.

524
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:34,423
Brian, it's-it's...
wonderful. Thank you.

525
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,692
Well, you gave me
the greatest gift of all.

526
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:38,361
I'll tell you about it sometime.

527
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:39,528
Brian.

528
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:41,163
Are we pregnant?

529
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,234
What? No, Stewie,
it's nothing like that.

530
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:44,768
Okay, well, I have to tell you,

531
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:45,903
I'm a little bit relieved.

532
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:48,388
Look, just, just, thanks
for everything, Stewie.

533
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:51,292
You're my best friend and I love you.

534
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:52,928
All I can say, Brian,

535
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:55,693
is you've been making
really creepy eye contact

536
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:58,390
with me all morning
and I want it to stop right now.

537
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:03,490
