00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,698
We now return to
<i>Home Alone with Competent Robbers.</i>

13
00:00:43,205 --> 00:00:45,106
Hey, be careful. There's
cars on the floor here.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,907
Thanks.
That's weird, huh?

15
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:48,476
Yeah. The doorknob
was really hot,

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,911
but I just let go instead
of holding onto it.

17
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:53,180
And there's some ice
on the stairs to the basement,

18
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:55,716
so I guess just
don't go down there.

19
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,985
Just so you guys know,
I have a tarantula.

20
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:02,323
Well, now there
are no witnesses.

21
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:04,825
Come on, everybody,
let's go to the mall.

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,894
It's time for the
Christmas Carnival.

23
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:09,163
It's Stewie's
first Christmas.

24
00:01:09,197 --> 00:01:10,364
Again?

25
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:13,401
I love the
Christmas Carnival!

26
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:14,568
Chris, calm down.

27
00:01:14,603 --> 00:01:16,237
You're giving
yourself a nosebleed.

28
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:18,105
You know, the best thing
about the Quahog Mall

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,708
is going into Tiffany's
and doing everything possible

30
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:23,010
to make 'em think I might
actually buy something.

31
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:25,379
Oh, this is lovely.
Just lovely.

32
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:26,547
How much is this?

33
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:27,982
$1,200.

34
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:29,283
Great, great.

35
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:31,585
That's all? A-And how late
are you open this evening?

36
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,586
Until 7:00.

37
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:33,654
Perfect, perfect.

38
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:35,517
And you accept
credit cards and cash?

39
00:01:35,518 --> 00:01:36,266
Yes.

40
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:37,092
And what's your name?

41
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,331
I want to make sure you
get credit for this sale.

42
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:41,495
Evan.
Oh, that's a great name.

43
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,930
Oh, and these watches here,

44
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:45,399
if I wanted to get 11 of them
for different groomsmen,

45
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:47,416
could they each get
engraved individually?

46
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,169
Yes.

47
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,870
And you do that on site?
Yes.

48
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:53,908
Fantastic. Now, the groomsmen's
names are Blake, Hayden, Edgar,

49
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:57,278
Blake D., Elliott,
Milo, Cooper...

50
00:01:57,312 --> 00:01:58,946
Why aren't you writing
any of these down?

51
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,549
You're wearing Sbarro
wrappers for shoes, sir.

52
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,219
There <i>may</i> have been
a trade.

53
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:14,929
Hey, nice outfit.

54
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:17,198
Fancy pair of shoes, too.

55
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:20,034
Do you, do you only use
adjectives sarcastically?

56
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:23,170
Great question,
smart guy.

57
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:25,039
What the hell?
Where's all the decorations?

58
00:02:25,073 --> 00:02:26,373
And the big Christmas tree?

59
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:27,408
Oh, look, there's Santa.

60
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:28,576
Peter, no.

61
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,077
That's a Hells Angel.

62
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:31,078
What do you want?

63
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:31,979
Meth?

64
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:33,013
Okay.

65
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:35,182
There's no
Christmas Carnival, Dad.

66
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:36,684
You seem to know
a lot about this, Meg.

67
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:37,651
What did you do?

68
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:39,487
No Christmas Carnival?

69
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:40,921
Whoever is responsible
for this

70
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:42,556
shall suffer
my eternal wrath.

71
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:44,258
Who's this guy?

72
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,759
Tough don't sell
in curly-toed shoes.

73
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:47,294
Leave me alone.

74
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:50,164
Why don't you go bother
the cologne salesman at Macy's?

75
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:51,866
I want something I
can wear on the street

76
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,602
that a broad can smell
on a fire escape.

77
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:56,904
There's gotta be
an explanation for this.

78
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:58,205
Let's ask that security guard

79
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,207
who has everything on
his belt except a gun.

80
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:02,142
E-Excuse me, sir?

81
00:03:02,177 --> 00:03:03,244
It's "officer."

82
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:05,513
No, it's not.
It's barely "sir."

83
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:06,680
Yeah, I know.

84
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:08,716
Where is
the Christmas Carnival?

85
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,384
Canceled.
I don't know why.

86
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:12,686
I'm just a small cog
in this operation.

87
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:13,988
You hear that, Dad?

88
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:16,624
You're not the only one
around here with a small cog.

89
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:19,460
I told you that
in confidence, Chris.

90
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:21,428
Daddy, where's Santa?

91
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:23,330
Was he killed by Muslims?

92
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:25,266
Oh, my God,
poor Stewie.

93
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,101
He's so
disappointed.

94
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:29,270
Of course he is, Lois.
I feel the same way.

95
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:31,071
How come every time
I'm feelin' happy,

96
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:32,940
somebody's gotta
come along and ruin it?

97
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:35,676
Are you enjoying
your coffee, sir?

98
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,611
Yeah, it's very
smooth. Good flavor.

99
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:40,814
What if we told you that
we secretly replaced your coffee

100
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:42,116
with Folgers Crystals?

101
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,651
Wouldn't you
feel like a dumbass?

102
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:45,719
'Cause of how you just
raved about it just now?

103
00:03:45,754 --> 00:03:47,788
You stupid
son of a bitch.

104
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,430
Boy, Stewie was
really upset

105
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:58,732
about the Christmas
Carnival being canceled.

106
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:00,067
He's been acting
out all week.

107
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:02,269
Ah, I'm sure he'll
be over it in no time.

108
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:04,738
Besides, how much trouble
can he cause? He's a baby.

109
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:18,986
We now return to
<i>Miracle on 134th Street.</i>

110
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,822
Oh, my God, I left
my phone in my car.

111
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:24,425
Wow, it's still there.

112
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:33,100
Hey, I've been askin' around
about this carnival thing.

113
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:35,135
Turns out I know a guy
who knows a guy

114
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,104
who knows another guy
who knows a girl,

115
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:39,573
which is weird because they
don't usually know nothin',

116
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:42,076
who says the carnival was
canceled by the mall's owner,

117
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,711
some guy named
Carter Pewterschmidt.

118
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:45,112
Oh, my God.

119
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:48,048
So I got another guy workin'
on findin' out who that is.

120
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,283
It's my father.

121
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:52,252
Oh! This is a twist
I did not expect.

122
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:55,489
Oh! Excuse me, I'm just gonna
have to "Oh" this out

123
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:57,491
until I'm not
surprised anymore.

124
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:00,027
Oh! Oh! Oh.

125
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:03,297
Oh... Oh. Oh.

126
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:05,099
Lois, before I get mad
at your dad,

127
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,900
h-he isn't the Little
Caesars guy, is he?

128
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:08,296
No, Peter,
we've been through this.

129
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:10,270
Good. I could never
be mad at that guy.

130
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:12,239
He says my favorite word
twice in a row.

131
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:13,941
Now, I'm gonna go
talk to your father

132
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:15,909
and get him to bring back
the Christmas Carnival.

133
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:17,478
Peter, I don't think
that's gonna work.

134
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:18,946
Sure, it will.

135
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,215
The nerve of your dad, takin'
the fun out of Christmas,

136
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,384
like some kind of
gluten-free Santa.

137
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:25,853
Hey. Hey,
what's in these?

138
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,021
Huh?

139
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:29,189
I'm okay if it's,
like, coconut flour.

140
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:31,792
But anything with actual
grains, I can't do.

141
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:33,060
I'm not sure.

142
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:35,429
Well, who <i>is</i> sure?

143
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:47,574
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
there's a man here

144
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:50,244
who says he's the guy whose
picture is on all the money.

145
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:51,779
Holy cow. Send him in.

146
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:54,548
Griffin.

147
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:57,151
That's right, and this is my
own <i>People</i> magazine from home

148
00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:58,819
and not from your
waiting room just now,

149
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,721
and why did you cancel
the Christmas Carnival?

150
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:02,189
Because I hate Christmas.

151
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:04,525
You know what it's like being
rich at Christmas, Griffin?

152
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:07,995
Everyone expects an expensive
present, and I get nothing.

153
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:10,798
Did you... did you just have
your hand in my fish tank?

154
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:12,066
No.

155
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,260
Sheesh, Carter,
you know what?

156
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,402
I am gonna help you find
the Christmas spirit

157
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:16,770
so you bring back
the carnival.

158
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:17,938
Look, are we done here?

159
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:19,473
Um, yeah, uh, just
one more thing.

160
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:22,276
Can I choose one thing in your office
to take home with me?

161
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,544
No.

162
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:27,214
Aw, too bad. 'Cause I
was gonna choose you.

163
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:29,650
You're weird.
You're a weird guy.

164
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:36,899
No. No-no, no.

165
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:38,100
I want to zip it.

166
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:44,240
It's okay, Peter,
you're good at other stuff.

167
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:45,775
So you're gonna
help your old man

168
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,643
find his Christmas
spirit again, huh?

169
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:49,445
Oh, yeah, that
sounds real bad,

170
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,380
her father don't
like Christmas.

171
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:53,549
My father was drowned
to death in a birdbath

172
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,284
by an officer
of the law.

173
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,419
His will just said,

174
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:58,788
"Kick Jimmy in the sack
for me. Go, Eagles."

175
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:00,222
My sympathies, Vinny.

176
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:02,458
Don't worry about it,
he was a scumbag.

177
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:04,093
Are you sure
about this, Peter?

178
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,162
I mean, I know
Stewie was disappointed

179
00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:08,064
about the carnival,
but he'll get over it.

180
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:09,765
He's a happy,
resilient baby.

181
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,033
I don't know, Lois.

182
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:12,668
I feel like if we
don't do something,

183
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:14,024
Stewie's first
words are gonna be,

184
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:15,371
"Why did you
kill Christmas?"

185
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:16,939
And I want the
carnival back, too.

186
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:19,408
You know, I know I'm usually
all business, but deep down,

187
00:07:19,443 --> 00:07:21,610
you know what the thing
is that keeps me going

188
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:22,645
more than
anything else?

189
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,946
Wonder.

190
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,915
A sense of wonder.

191
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,184
Well, you have your work
cut out for you, Peter.

192
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:31,053
My father's always
hated Christmas.

193
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:33,222
Hey, happy June 16.

194
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:35,291
Thought I'd see how
you like it when someone

195
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:37,893
breaks into your house
and touches all your stuff.

196
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:39,395
Hey. Knock it off.

197
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:41,330
I'm touching this.
And this over here.

198
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,432
You're a creep,
is my point.

199
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,037
All right, Carter, now,
you know what's guaranteed

200
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:49,472
to put you
in the holiday mood?

201
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:50,539
Write a Christmas letter

202
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:52,208
to all your friends
and relatives.

203
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:54,343
And keep in mind,
it's traditional to embellish

204
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:56,112
a little bit to make
yourself look better.

205
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:57,580
"Peter had a
great year,

206
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,248
"and is now starting
quarterback

207
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:01,283
for the Jacksonville
Jaguars."

208
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:03,552
What? People can easily
fact-check this.

209
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:05,354
Yeah, who has the time?
Keep reading.

210
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,490
"Chris refurbished a
vintage motorcycle,

211
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:09,291
"and Stewie can
slam-dunk a basketball

212
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:10,993
from a standing
start..."

213
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,328
Peter, that's
impossible.

214
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:13,763
Read what it says
about you.

215
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:15,698
"Lois's father,
Carter Pewterschmidt,

216
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,500
bought a small stool
for his balls."

217
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:18,934
Damn it, I'm not
proud of that.

218
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:20,870
Well, you have to
throw in some real facts.

219
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:23,272
That's what gives
the newsletter credibility.

220
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,676
Now, everyone knows the best way
to get the Christmas spirit

221
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:30,613
is to drink a whole lot
of thick, frothy eggnog.

222
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:31,447
So get going.

223
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,481
I don't like eggnog.

224
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:33,549
Drink the nog, Carter.

225
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,017
I don't... I don't want to.

226
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:37,420
Take it, Carter.
Take all the nog.

227
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:41,157
No.

228
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:42,525
Yeah, you like that nog.

229
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,893
Don't spit
the nog out.

230
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:45,995
Now look at the
camera for a POV shot.

231
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,164
Say thank you with
the nog in your mouth.

232
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:49,265
Thank you.
Louder.

233
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,699
Thank you.

234
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:53,068
Good, now go down
to the hotel lobby and check out

235
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:54,336
with nog all
over your face.

236
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:55,404
All right.

237
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:57,373
You know, I still
don't like Christmas,

238
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:59,675
but I kind of like
what we just did.

239
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:04,280
Okay, Carter, a big part
of Christmas is masturbating

240
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:06,615
like you would any other day
but feeling guilty about it

241
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,284
because it's Christmas.

242
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:16,392
What's
wrong with me?

243
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:17,393
Griffin,
this isn't working.

244
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:18,594
What? What do you mean?

245
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:20,162
I-I'm not getting
the holiday spirit,

246
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,330
so you can stop trying.

247
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:22,865
But Carter, it's
not just for me.

248
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,200
Think about Stewie.

249
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:26,068
He's all upset 'cause
there's no carnival.

250
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:27,470
Heh.
Different dog.

251
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:29,405
Yeah, this one's, like,
Italian or something.

252
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:30,806
Anyway, I think
we're done here.

253
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,274
No Christmas Carnival.

254
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,743
Wow, Carter. I had no
idea you were Jewish.

255
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:36,979
What? Is... is that
how this is coming off?

256
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:38,247
Yeah, kind of.

257
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,648
I mean, that's what
everyone's saying.

258
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:41,317
People think I'm Jewish?

259
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:56,031
Oh, this Christmas Carnival
has everything. Games, food.

260
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:58,634
Oh, my God, it's the carolers
from <i>A Christmas Story.</i>

261
00:09:58,668 --> 00:10:02,471
♪ Deck the harrs
with boughs of horry ♪

262
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:06,141
♪ Fa ra ra ra ra
ra ra ra ra ♪

263
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:07,977
That's right, America,
don't forget.

264
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:10,913
Your beloved holiday movie
is incredibly racist.

265
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:12,982
And flom
not that rong ago.

266
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:14,650
What's wrong with you,
Stews?

267
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:16,585
You're next up
to see the big guy himself

268
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,021
and you look like a piece
of spaghetti on the street.

269
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:21,023
I don't know. I thought
having the carnival back

270
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:22,258
would make me happy,

271
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:24,360
but it still feels like
something's missing.

272
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:26,161
Yeah, it's always somethin'.

273
00:10:26,196 --> 00:10:28,464
Like when I finally got
to sleep with Mary Lou Gallo.

274
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:30,766
She had a look,
but when you got up close,

275
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,635
she also had a smell.

276
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:34,637
Oh, Stewie, you're next.

277
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:36,605
Ho ho ho.

278
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,140
Mall Santa is
brought to you

279
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:40,309
in part this season
by Chipotle.

280
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:43,178
Between good and
garbage, it's Chipotle.

281
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:45,114
So, what do you want
for Christmas?

282
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:47,049
Oh, what do I want
for Christmas?

283
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,351
What <i>do</i> I want
for Christmas?

284
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,227
You know what I want
for Christmas?

285
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:00,095
I want my friend back.

286
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,330
Your friend?

287
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:02,765
Yes. My best friend.

288
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,600
My dog, Brian.

289
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,235
He's dead.

290
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:08,404
It's our first Christmas
without him

291
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:11,140
and no one's even
mentioned his name.

292
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:15,878
I don't care about this stupid
carnival or Christmas.

293
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:18,480
I don't care about
anything except Brian.

294
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:21,784
I want Brian.

295
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:26,488
You want me to put a
dead dog under your tree?

296
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:28,424
Yes.

297
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:33,495
And, uh,

298
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,297
I-I'd like
a bike, too.

299
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,929
We now return to <i>The Year</i>
<i>Without a Santa Claus or Sex.</i>

300
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:44,130
Daddy, where's
Santa Clau...

301
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:45,265
I don't know, okay?!

302
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,600
Should I ask Mom?

303
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:50,003
I don't know,
she's so busy with her job.

304
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:52,405
Hello there, Stewart.

305
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,374
What's this?
What are you doing, Vinny?

306
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:55,942
Vinny? Who's Vinny?

307
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:59,546
My name is Brian,
aka your favorite dog.

308
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,414
Hey, whose leg do
you gotta gagoosh

309
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:04,017
to get an Amaretto Di
Saronno around here?

310
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,885
Oh, forget it, Vinny.
You're not Brian.

311
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,821
Come on, I went through
a lot of trouble.

312
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:10,924
For example, I know Brian
was rather into politics,

313
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,392
so I read the newspaper.

314
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:15,495
What is goin' on with
all these politics, huh?

315
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:18,131
Well, that is about Brian's
level of political awareness.

316
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:19,633
Yeah, and you know
how Brian wrote

317
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:20,867
<i>Wish It, Want It, Do It?</i>

318
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:22,335
Well, I wrote
a book, too.

319
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,436
A little
something called

320
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:24,871
<i>Wish It, Want It,</i>
<i>You Blew It.</i>

321
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:26,039
Really?

322
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:28,942
Yup. Let me read
you an expert.

323
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:30,677
"You wish you
were a millionaire.

324
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:32,879
"You want more money.
Guess what.

325
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:34,014
"You blew it.

326
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,782
"You wish you could
change the neighborhood.

327
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:37,817
"You want to be
a selectman.

328
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:39,019
"You blew it.

329
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,887
"You wish you could
open up a restaurant.

330
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,889
"You did not want to
pay protection money.

331
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:44,057
"Knock, knock.
Who's there?

332
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:45,191
You blew it."

333
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:46,326
You blew it who?

334
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,460
You blew it bad.

335
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:49,663
You know what the last
page of the book is?

336
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:52,198
A mirror. So you can see
exactly who blew it.

337
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,333
Being you.

338
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,168
Look, I appreciate
all this, Vinny,

339
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:57,404
but there's only one Brian,

340
00:12:57,438 --> 00:13:00,006
and it's tough for me
that he's gone,

341
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,742
especially around the holidays.

342
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:05,045
Okay, I know what'll
cheer you up.

343
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:07,514
How about you open up one
of those Christmas presents?

344
00:13:07,548 --> 00:13:08,715
It's from me.

345
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,750
Merry Christmas.

346
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:13,019
What the hell?
There's a foot in this box.

347
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:15,121
That was supposed to
go to somebody else.

348
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:16,456
I'm very sorry.

349
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,724
Well, my friends,

350
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:20,393
I think Johnny "The Foot"
Giatelli is dead.

351
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:21,561
Oh no.

352
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:24,164
They killed Frankie
"Choo-Choo" Chinelli instead.

353
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:25,532
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

354
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,233
You sure that's
what this means?

355
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,703
Could be they killed
Davey "The Box" Frateli.

356
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:30,904
- Ooh. - Ooh.
- Ooh.

357
00:13:30,938 --> 00:13:32,539
Hold on, it
could also be

358
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:35,041
they killed Jimmy
"Tissue Paper" Scungili.

359
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:37,877
I just saw Jimmy yesterday
at my kid's christening.

360
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:39,446
So maybe
it wasn't Jimmy.

361
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,647
Maybe this
means they killed

362
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:42,449
Anthony "The Air
Around the Box" Minetti.

363
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,151
Oh, no, they killed

364
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:47,053
Sal "Holding The Box
That We Can't Figure Out

365
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:49,222
What The Box Means" Casella.

366
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:51,324
Here, I got this
for you, too.

367
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,593
A bowling shirt?

368
00:13:53,627 --> 00:13:54,928
You can wear
it anywhere.

369
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:56,863
To the beach,
a wedding on the beach,

370
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:59,399
beach graduation,
beach funeral,

371
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:01,868
business conference
which could be at a beach,

372
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:03,002
a stroll
through the park,

373
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:05,171
should that park be
adjacent to a beach.

374
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:06,339
Thanks.

375
00:14:06,374 --> 00:14:07,807
What, you
don't like it?

376
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:09,309
How's about we
go to the mall

377
00:14:09,343 --> 00:14:10,844
and pick out something
you do like?

378
00:14:10,878 --> 00:14:13,213
Well, I suppose
I could browse the toy store.

379
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,081
Possibly pick up
a new action figure.

380
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:16,583
That's the spirit.

381
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:18,737
All right, I better get out
of these professor clothes

382
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:20,754
before I kick
my own ass.

383
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:27,827
Okay, Stewie.
Pick anything you want, on me.

384
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:30,663
I don't know. I hate the toy
store this close to Christmas.

385
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:32,265
It's always
been picked clean.

386
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:33,933
There's plenty of
good stuff here.

387
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:36,936
Look at this, heavy
bronze sheep bookends.

388
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:39,372
What kid wouldn't want
to play with these?

389
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:41,074
"Baa. What are
you lookin' at?"

390
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:43,143
"Not much, that's
what I'm lookin' at."

391
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:44,411
"You want to have a go?"

392
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:45,545
"I'd watch what I say

393
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:47,614
with that other sheep
right behind you."

394
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:49,983
I played this as a kid.

395
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:52,018
Course, I had to do
it with ashtrays,

396
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,653
but I think the
sheep is better.

397
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:57,290
Wait a minute.
Who is that?

398
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:04,531
I think... I think
I know that boy.

399
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:20,780
Vinny,
that stocking cap.

400
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:21,981
It's mine.

401
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:25,685
That boy is me.

402
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:28,221
Of course.
It's me from the past.

403
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,390
Several months ago,
I time-traveled ahead

404
00:15:30,424 --> 00:15:31,925
to purchase
that Christmas toy.

405
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:34,093
I don't understand, so
I'm angry and hungry.

406
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:35,929
I'm gonna go
punch a sandwich.

407
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,299
Wow, good timing,
little fella.

408
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,600
This just
came out today.

409
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:43,336
Yeah, I kind of
knew that already.

410
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,805
The time machine return pad
is in the backpack

411
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,240
that other Stewie is wearing.

412
00:15:47,274 --> 00:15:49,108
I must get
my hands on it, Vinny.

413
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:50,343
Vinny?

414
00:15:50,377 --> 00:15:52,212
That was a
tough sandwich.

415
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:53,880
As tough as your
mom's fat face.

416
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:55,315
Hey, leave my mother
out of this.

417
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,650
That woman stitched gloves
till she was 90.

418
00:15:57,685 --> 00:15:59,686
I heard she was
good with her hands.

419
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,920
Nice.

420
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:03,423
Hey, everybody, we got
a funny sandwich here.

421
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,626
Vinny, I need you
to get that Stewie

422
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,961
to take off
his backpack.

423
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:09,662
Listen, Stewie,
I'm not following.

424
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:10,930
I don't have time
to explain.

425
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:12,131
I've got to
steal something...

426
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,967
That's it. You've
already explained.

427
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:15,802
You got to steal
something. Got it.

428
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:17,370
Wait-Wait a sec,
what's your plan?

429
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:19,239
Trust me, I think
I know you well enough

430
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:20,940
to know how to distract
the other you.

431
00:16:25,346 --> 00:16:26,946
Hey, how you doing?

432
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:29,182
This may sound a little
presumptuous of me,

433
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:31,618
but, uh, you ever
do any modeling?

434
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:32,852
Well, not
professionally,

435
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,521
but I-I-I have
thought about it.

436
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:35,722
You ought to.

437
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:38,191
What are you, like,
six-three? Six-four?

438
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:40,226
Y-Y-You're in...
you're in the ballpark.

439
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:41,728
I-I-I carry
myself taller.

440
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:43,396
Good posture,
very important.

441
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,898
Oh, I agree.

442
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:46,533
Let me see, let me see.

443
00:16:49,003 --> 00:16:50,036
That's good.

444
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,504
But I feel like that backpack

445
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:53,306
might be hiding
some figure flaws.

446
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,577
Well, that is where
you are wrong, my friend.

447
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,150
You know, my friends ask me,

448
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:06,586
"Stewie, why do you throw up
after every meal?"

449
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,954
This.

450
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:09,255
This is why.

451
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,060
All right, whatever
you gotta do, do it quick.

452
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:15,595
The other you
is in the back

453
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:17,997
changing into a pair of
tap shoes, for some reason.

454
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:20,266
♪ Animal crackers
in my soup... ♪

455
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,668
Hey, where did
that guy go?

456
00:17:21,702 --> 00:17:24,437
Excellent. Now all I've got
to do is set the coordinates

457
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:25,972
to the moment before
Brian got killed

458
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:27,106
and I can save him.

459
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:29,409
Oh, yeah, Scott Bakula
and all that.

460
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,077
Yes, Vinny.
Scott Bakula.

461
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:33,346
Well, thank you
for everything.

462
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,547
You bet.

463
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:37,483
You realize if I save Brian,

464
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:39,319
my family won't
get another dog,

465
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:41,821
which means we
will never have met.

466
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:44,624
I'll probably
never see you again.

467
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,960
Oh.

468
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:50,229
So, I think this is good-bye.

469
00:17:50,264 --> 00:17:52,565
Hey, I'm man's best friend,

470
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,034
not some stupid baby's
best friend, right?

471
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:07,113
Good dog, Vinny.
Good dog.

472
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:09,983
Georgette,
I'm coming home.

473
00:18:10,017 --> 00:18:11,784
Who the hell is Georgette?

474
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:16,990
Okay, Brian, I'm just
putting this out there,

475
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:20,159
but I'm a baby and only dicks
don't let babies win.

476
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:21,761
God, look at
this day, huh?

477
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:23,796
You know, usually, I'd be
sitting inside writing,

478
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:25,732
you'd be working on
one of your machines.

479
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:27,433
But here we are
enjoying it.

480
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:29,268
Yes, it is a nice
change of pace.

481
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:31,137
Oh, wait, I gotta
go grab my knee pads.

482
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,906
I was using them for...
for, for this other thing.

483
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:35,475
Anyway, I-I'll be
right back.

484
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,350
Brian, look out!

485
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,720
What the hell?

486
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:50,356
You're alive,
my friend.

487
00:18:50,391 --> 00:18:51,424
What?
Course I'm alive.

488
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,692
What the hell's
going on here?

489
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:54,427
Brian, that car
killed you.

490
00:18:54,461 --> 00:18:57,764
And when it did, a little
part of me died as well.

491
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:58,998
I couldn't live without you.

492
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,434
So I came back from the future
to save your life.

493
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:02,835
Whoa. Wait,
wait a minute.

494
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,003
What are you
talking about?

495
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:05,471
I saw you destroy
your time machine.

496
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:07,740
Yes, but luckily, I ran into
another me from the past,

497
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,909
so I stole his return pad
and came back here.

498
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:11,210
Oh, that reminds me.

499
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:13,246
I've gotta send this back
where it came from.

500
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:20,086
Hmm. I'm starting to think
that guy

501
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,654
wasn't a real modeling agent.

502
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:23,423
And I'm starting to think
that other guy

503
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:25,658
wasn't a real
penis-butt inspector.

504
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:29,162
Wow, Stewie, thank you
for saving my life.

505
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:30,930
You know, a whole
lot of other families

506
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:32,965
would've just gotten a
different dog and moved on.

507
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,168
Oh, oh, we could,
we could never

508
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:37,203
do something
like that, Brian.

509
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:39,439
Stewie, what's
happening to you?

510
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:42,341
I think... My time line
is being erased.

511
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:45,278
The time line where
you died no longer exists.

512
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:48,381
Merry Christmas, Brian.

513
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,184
Hey, who were you
talking to out here?

514
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:54,320
A pretty awesome guy.

515
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:55,421
Oh, "pretty awesome guy."

516
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:56,689
Why don't you
marry him, huh?

517
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:57,724
All right, game on.

518
00:19:57,758 --> 00:19:59,759
Aah!

519
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:02,729
Stew-S-A.
Stew-S-A. Stew-S-A.

520
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:12,438
Oven mitts.
Wow, thanks, Mom.

521
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:13,906
Now you don't
have to ask me

522
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:16,642
if everything is hot
before you touch it.

523
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:19,679
Are... are
the oven mitts hot?

524
00:20:19,713 --> 00:20:22,315
Here you go, Stewie.
Merry Christmas.

525
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:29,822
Brian, it's-it's...
wonderful. Thank you.

526
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:32,091
Well, you gave me
the greatest gift of all.

527
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:33,760
I'll tell you
about it sometime.

528
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:34,927
Brian.

529
00:20:34,962 --> 00:20:36,562
Are we pregnant?

530
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:38,633
What? No, Stewie,
it's nothing like that.

531
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,167
Okay, well, I
have to tell you,

532
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:41,302
I'm a little
bit relieved.

533
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:43,787
Look, just, just, thanks
for everything, Stewie.

534
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:46,691
You're my best friend
and I love you.

535
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,327
All I can say, Brian,

536
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:51,092
is you've been making
really creepy eye contact

537
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:53,789
with me all morning
and I want it to stop right now.
