We now return to
<i>Home Alone with Competent Robbers.</i>

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

14
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,107
Hey, be careful. There's
cars on the floor here.

15
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:46,908
Thanks.
That's weird, huh?

16
00:00:46,943 --> 00:00:48,477
Yeah. The doorknob
was really hot,

17
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,912
but I just let go instead
of holding onto it.

18
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:53,181
And there's some ice
on the stairs to the basement,

19
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:55,717
so I guess just
don't go down there.

20
00:00:55,752 --> 00:00:57,986
Just so you guys know,
I have a tarantula.

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,324
Well, now there
are no witnesses.

22
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:04,826
Come on, everybody,
let's go to the mall.

23
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:06,895
It's time for the
Christmas Carnival.

24
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:09,164
It's Stewie's
first Christmas.

25
00:01:09,198 --> 00:01:10,365
Again?

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,402
I love the
Christmas Carnival!

27
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:14,569
Chris, calm down.

28
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:16,238
You're giving
yourself a nosebleed.

29
00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:18,106
You know, the best thing
about the Quahog Mall

30
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:20,709
is going into Tiffany's
and doing everything possible

31
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:23,011
to make 'em think I might
actually buy something.

32
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,380
Oh, this is lovely.
Just lovely.

33
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:26,548
How much is this?

34
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:27,983
$1,200.

35
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:29,284
Great, great.

36
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:31,586
That's all? A-And how late
are you open this evening?

37
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,587
Until 7:00.

38
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:33,655
Perfect, perfect.

39
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,518
And you accept
credit cards and cash?

40
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,267
Yes.

41
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:37,093
And what's your name?

42
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:39,332
I want to make sure you
get credit for this sale.

43
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,496
Evan.
Oh, that's a great name.

44
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:42,931
Oh, and these watches here,

45
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:45,400
if I wanted to get 11 of them
for different groomsmen,

46
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:47,417
could they each get
engraved individually?

47
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:48,170
Yes.

48
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,871
And you do that on site?
Yes.

49
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:53,909
Fantastic. Now, the groomsmen's
names are Blake, Hayden, Edgar,

50
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:57,279
Blake D., Elliott,
Milo, Cooper...

51
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:58,947
Why aren't you writing
any of these down?

52
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:01,550
You're wearing Sbarro
wrappers for shoes, sir.

53
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:05,220
There <i>may</i> have been
a trade.

54
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:14,930
Hey, nice outfit.

55
00:02:14,964 --> 00:02:17,199
Fancy pair of shoes, too.

56
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:20,035
Do you, do you only use
adjectives sarcastically?

57
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:23,171
Great question,
smart guy.

58
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:25,040
What the hell?
Where's all the decorations?

59
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:26,374
And the big Christmas tree?

60
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:27,409
Oh, look, there's Santa.

61
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:28,577
Peter, no.

62
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:30,078
That's a Hells Angel.

63
00:02:30,112 --> 00:02:31,079
What do you want?

64
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:31,980
Meth?

65
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:33,014
Okay.

66
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,183
There's no
Christmas Carnival, Dad.

67
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:36,685
You seem to know
a lot about this, Meg.

68
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,652
What did you do?

69
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:39,488
No Christmas Carnival?

70
00:02:39,522 --> 00:02:40,922
Whoever is responsible
for this

71
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,557
shall suffer
my eternal wrath.

72
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,259
Who's this guy?

73
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,760
Tough don't sell
in curly-toed shoes.

74
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:47,295
Leave me alone.

75
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,165
Why don't you go bother
the cologne salesman at Macy's?

76
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,867
I want something I
can wear on the street

77
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:54,603
that a broad can smell
on a fire escape.

78
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:56,905
There's gotta be
an explanation for this.

79
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,206
Let's ask that security guard

80
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:00,208
who has everything on
his belt except a gun.

81
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:02,143
E-Excuse me, sir?

82
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:03,245
It's "officer."

83
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:05,514
No, it's not.
It's barely "sir."

84
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:06,681
Yeah, I know.

85
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:08,717
Where is
the Christmas Carnival?

86
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:10,385
Canceled.
I don't know why.

87
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,687
I'm just a small cog
in this operation.

88
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:13,989
You hear that, Dad?

89
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:16,625
You're not the only one
around here with a small cog.

90
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,461
I told you that
in confidence, Chris.

91
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:21,429
Daddy, where's Santa?

92
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:23,331
Was he killed by Muslims?

93
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,267
Oh, my God,
poor Stewie.

94
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,102
He's so
disappointed.

95
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:29,271
Of course he is, Lois.
I feel the same way.

96
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:31,072
How come every time
I'm feelin' happy,

97
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,941
somebody's gotta
come along and ruin it?

98
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:35,677
Are you enjoying
your coffee, sir?

99
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:37,612
Yeah, it's very
smooth. Good flavor.

100
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,815
What if we told you that
we secretly replaced your coffee

101
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,117
with Folgers Crystals?

102
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:43,652
Wouldn't you
feel like a dumbass?

103
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,720
'Cause of how you just
raved about it just now?

104
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:47,789
You stupid
son of a bitch.

105
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:56,431
Boy, Stewie was
really upset

106
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:58,733
about the Christmas
Carnival being canceled.

107
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:00,068
He's been acting
out all week.

108
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:02,270
Ah, I'm sure he'll
be over it in no time.

109
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:04,739
Besides, how much trouble
can he cause? He's a baby.

110
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:18,987
We now return to
<i>Miracle on 134th Street.</i>

111
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,823
Oh, my God, I left
my phone in my car.

112
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:24,426
Wow, it's still there.

113
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,101
Hey, I've been askin' around
about this carnival thing.

114
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:35,136
Turns out I know a guy
who knows a guy

115
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,105
who knows another guy
who knows a girl,

116
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,574
which is weird because they
don't usually know nothin',

117
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:42,077
who says the carnival was
canceled by the mall's owner,

118
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,712
some guy named
Carter Pewterschmidt.

119
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:45,113
Oh, my God.

120
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:48,049
So I got another guy workin'
on findin' out who that is.

121
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:49,284
It's my father.

122
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:52,253
Oh! This is a twist
I did not expect.

123
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:55,490
Oh! Excuse me, I'm just gonna
have to "Oh" this out

124
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:57,492
until I'm not
surprised anymore.

125
00:04:57,526 --> 00:05:00,028
Oh! Oh! Oh.

126
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:03,298
Oh... Oh. Oh.

127
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:05,100
Lois, before I get mad
at your dad,

128
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:06,901
h-he isn't the Little
Caesars guy, is he?

129
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:08,297
No, Peter,
we've been through this.

130
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:10,271
Good. I could never
be mad at that guy.

131
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:12,240
He says my favorite word
twice in a row.

132
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:13,942
Now, I'm gonna go
talk to your father

133
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:15,910
and get him to bring back
the Christmas Carnival.

134
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:17,479
Peter, I don't think
that's gonna work.

135
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:18,947
Sure, it will.

136
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:21,216
The nerve of your dad, takin'
the fun out of Christmas,

137
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,385
like some kind of
gluten-free Santa.

138
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:25,854
Hey. Hey,
what's in these?

139
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:27,022
Huh?

140
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:29,190
I'm okay if it's,
like, coconut flour.

141
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:31,793
But anything with actual
grains, I can't do.

142
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:33,061
I'm not sure.

143
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:35,430
Well, who <i>is</i> sure?

144
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:47,575
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
there's a man here

145
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,245
who says he's the guy whose
picture is on all the money.

146
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,780
Holy cow. Send him in.

147
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:54,549
Griffin.

148
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,152
That's right, and this is my
own <i>People</i> magazine from home

149
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:58,820
and not from your
waiting room just now,

150
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:00,722
and why did you cancel
the Christmas Carnival?

151
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,190
Because I hate Christmas.

152
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:04,526
You know what it's like being
rich at Christmas, Griffin?

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,996
Everyone expects an expensive
present, and I get nothing.

154
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,799
Did you... did you just have
your hand in my fish tank?

155
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,067
No.

156
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:13,261
Sheesh, Carter,
you know what?

157
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:15,403
I am gonna help you find
the Christmas spirit

158
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:16,771
so you bring back
the carnival.

159
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:17,939
Look, are we done here?

160
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:19,474
Um, yeah, uh, just
one more thing.

161
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:22,277
Can I choose one thing in your office
to take home with me?

162
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:23,545
No.

163
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,215
Aw, too bad. 'Cause I
was gonna choose you.

164
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:29,651
You're weird.
You're a weird guy.

165
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,900
No. No-no, no.

166
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,101
I want to zip it.

167
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:44,241
It's okay, Peter,
you're good at other stuff.

168
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:45,776
So you're gonna
help your old man

169
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,644
find his Christmas
spirit again, huh?

170
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,446
Oh, yeah, that
sounds real bad,

171
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,381
her father don't
like Christmas.

172
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,550
My father was drowned
to death in a birdbath

173
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,285
by an officer
of the law.

174
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,420
His will just said,

175
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:58,789
"Kick Jimmy in the sack
for me. Go, Eagles."

176
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:00,223
My sympathies, Vinny.

177
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:02,459
Don't worry about it,
he was a scumbag.

178
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:04,094
Are you sure
about this, Peter?

179
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:06,163
I mean, I know
Stewie was disappointed

180
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:08,065
about the carnival,
but he'll get over it.

181
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,766
He's a happy,
resilient baby.

182
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,034
I don't know, Lois.

183
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,669
I feel like if we
don't do something,

184
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:14,025
Stewie's first
words are gonna be,

185
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:15,372
"Why did you
kill Christmas?"

186
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:16,940
And I want the
carnival back, too.

187
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:19,409
You know, I know I'm usually
all business, but deep down,

188
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:21,611
you know what the thing
is that keeps me going

189
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:22,646
more than
anything else?

190
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,947
Wonder.

191
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:25,916
A sense of wonder.

192
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,185
Well, you have your work
cut out for you, Peter.

193
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:31,054
My father's always
hated Christmas.

194
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,223
Hey, happy June 16.

195
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:35,292
Thought I'd see how
you like it when someone

196
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:37,894
breaks into your house
and touches all your stuff.

197
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:39,396
Hey. Knock it off.

198
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,331
I'm touching this.
And this over here.

199
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:43,433
You're a creep,
is my point.

200
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:48,038
All right, Carter, now,
you know what's guaranteed

201
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:49,473
to put you
in the holiday mood?

202
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:50,540
Write a Christmas letter

203
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:52,209
to all your friends
and relatives.

204
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:54,344
And keep in mind,
it's traditional to embellish

205
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,113
a little bit to make
yourself look better.

206
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:57,581
"Peter had a
great year,

207
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:59,249
"and is now starting
quarterback

208
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,284
for the Jacksonville
Jaguars."

209
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,553
What? People can easily
fact-check this.

210
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:05,355
Yeah, who has the time?
Keep reading.

211
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,491
"Chris refurbished a
vintage motorcycle,

212
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:09,292
"and Stewie can
slam-dunk a basketball

213
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:10,994
from a standing
start..."

214
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,329
Peter, that's
impossible.

215
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:13,764
Read what it says
about you.

216
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:15,699
"Lois's father,
Carter Pewterschmidt,

217
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,501
bought a small stool
for his balls."

218
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:18,935
Damn it, I'm not
proud of that.

219
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,871
Well, you have to
throw in some real facts.

220
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:23,273
That's what gives
the newsletter credibility.

221
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,677
Now, everyone knows the best way
to get the Christmas spirit

222
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:30,614
is to drink a whole lot
of thick, frothy eggnog.

223
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:31,448
So get going.

224
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:32,482
I don't like eggnog.

225
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:33,550
Drink the nog, Carter.

226
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:35,018
I don't... I don't want to.

227
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:37,421
Take it, Carter.
Take all the nog.

228
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:41,158
No.

229
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:42,526
Yeah, you like that nog.

230
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,894
Don't spit
the nog out.

231
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:45,996
Now look at the
camera for a POV shot.

232
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,165
Say thank you with
the nog in your mouth.

233
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:49,266
Thank you.
Louder.

234
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,700
Thank you.

235
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:53,069
Good, now go down
to the hotel lobby and check out

236
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:54,337
with nog all
over your face.

237
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:55,405
All right.

238
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,374
You know, I still
don't like Christmas,

239
00:08:57,408 --> 00:08:59,676
but I kind of like
what we just did.

240
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:04,281
Okay, Carter, a big part
of Christmas is masturbating

241
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:06,616
like you would any other day
but feeling guilty about it

242
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:08,285
because it's Christmas.

243
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,393
What's
wrong with me?

244
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:17,394
Griffin,
this isn't working.

245
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:18,595
What? What do you mean?

246
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,163
I-I'm not getting
the holiday spirit,

247
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:21,331
so you can stop trying.

248
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:22,866
But Carter, it's
not just for me.

249
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,201
Think about Stewie.

250
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:26,069
He's all upset 'cause
there's no carnival.

251
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,471
Heh.
Different dog.

252
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:29,406
Yeah, this one's, like,
Italian or something.

253
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,807
Anyway, I think
we're done here.

254
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:32,275
No Christmas Carnival.

255
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,744
Wow, Carter. I had no
idea you were Jewish.

256
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,980
What? Is... is that
how this is coming off?

257
00:09:37,014 --> 00:09:38,248
Yeah, kind of.

258
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:39,649
I mean, that's what
everyone's saying.

259
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:41,318
People think I'm Jewish?

260
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,032
Oh, this Christmas Carnival
has everything. Games, food.

261
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,635
Oh, my God, it's the carolers
from <i>A Christmas Story.</i>

262
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:02,472
♪ Deck the harrs
with boughs of horry ♪

263
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:06,142
♪ Fa ra ra ra ra
ra ra ra ra ♪

264
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:07,978
That's right, America,
don't forget.

265
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:10,914
Your beloved holiday movie
is incredibly racist.

266
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:12,983
And flom
not that rong ago.

267
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,651
What's wrong with you,
Stews?

268
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:16,586
You're next up
to see the big guy himself

269
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:19,022
and you look like a piece
of spaghetti on the street.

270
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:21,024
I don't know. I thought
having the carnival back

271
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:22,259
would make me happy,

272
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:24,361
but it still feels like
something's missing.

273
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:26,162
Yeah, it's always somethin'.

274
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:28,465
Like when I finally got
to sleep with Mary Lou Gallo.

275
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:30,767
She had a look,
but when you got up close,

276
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:32,636
she also had a smell.

277
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,638
Oh, Stewie, you're next.

278
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:36,606
Ho ho ho.

279
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:38,141
Mall Santa is
brought to you

280
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:40,310
in part this season
by Chipotle.

281
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:43,179
Between good and
garbage, it's Chipotle.

282
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:45,115
So, what do you want
for Christmas?

283
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:47,050
Oh, what do I want
for Christmas?

284
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:49,352
What <i>do</i> I want
for Christmas?

285
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,228
You know what I want
for Christmas?

286
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:00,096
I want my friend back.

287
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:01,331
Your friend?

288
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:02,766
Yes. My best friend.

289
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,601
My dog, Brian.

290
00:11:04,635 --> 00:11:06,236
He's dead.

291
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,405
It's our first Christmas
without him

292
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:11,141
and no one's even
mentioned his name.

293
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:15,879
I don't care about this stupid
carnival or Christmas.

294
00:11:15,913 --> 00:11:18,481
I don't care about
anything except Brian.

295
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:21,785
I want Brian.

296
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:26,489
You want me to put a
dead dog under your tree?

297
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:28,425
Yes.

298
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:33,496
And, uh,

299
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:35,298
I-I'd like
a bike, too.

300
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:42,930
We now return to <i>The Year</i>
<i>Without a Santa Claus or Sex.</i>

301
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,131
Daddy, where's
Santa Clau...

302
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,266
I don't know, okay?!

303
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,601
Should I ask Mom?

304
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:50,004
I don't know,
she's so busy with her job.

305
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:52,406
Hello there, Stewart.

306
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:54,375
What's this?
What are you doing, Vinny?

307
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:55,943
Vinny? Who's Vinny?

308
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:59,547
My name is Brian,
aka your favorite dog.

309
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:01,415
Hey, whose leg do
you gotta gagoosh

310
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,018
to get an Amaretto Di
Saronno around here?

311
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:05,886
Oh, forget it, Vinny.
You're not Brian.

312
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,822
Come on, I went through
a lot of trouble.

313
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:10,925
For example, I know Brian
was rather into politics,

314
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,393
so I read the newspaper.

315
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:15,496
What is goin' on with
all these politics, huh?

316
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,132
Well, that is about Brian's
level of political awareness.

317
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,634
Yeah, and you know
how Brian wrote

318
00:12:19,668 --> 00:12:20,868
<i>Wish It, Want It, Do It?</i>

319
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:22,336
Well, I wrote
a book, too.

320
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:23,437
A little
something called

321
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:24,872
<i>Wish It, Want It,</i>
<i>You Blew It.</i>

322
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:26,040
Really?

323
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:28,943
Yup. Let me read
you an expert.

324
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:30,678
"You wish you
were a millionaire.

325
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:32,880
"You want more money.
Guess what.

326
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:34,015
"You blew it.

327
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:35,783
"You wish you could
change the neighborhood.

328
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,818
"You want to be
a selectman.

329
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:39,020
"You blew it.

330
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:40,888
"You wish you could
open up a restaurant.

331
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:42,890
"You did not want to
pay protection money.

332
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:44,058
"Knock, knock.
Who's there?

333
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:45,192
You blew it."

334
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:46,327
You blew it who?

335
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:47,461
You blew it bad.

336
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:49,664
You know what the last
page of the book is?

337
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:52,199
A mirror. So you can see
exactly who blew it.

338
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:53,334
Being you.

339
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:55,169
Look, I appreciate
all this, Vinny,

340
00:12:55,203 --> 00:12:57,405
but there's only one Brian,

341
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:00,007
and it's tough for me
that he's gone,

342
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,743
especially around the holidays.

343
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:05,046
Okay, I know what'll
cheer you up.

344
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,515
How about you open up one
of those Christmas presents?

345
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:08,716
It's from me.

346
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,751
Merry Christmas.

347
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:13,020
What the hell?
There's a foot in this box.

348
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:15,122
That was supposed to
go to somebody else.

349
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:16,457
I'm very sorry.

350
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:17,725
Well, my friends,

351
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,394
I think Johnny "The Foot"
Giatelli is dead.

352
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:21,562
Oh no.

353
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:24,165
They killed Frankie
"Choo-Choo" Chinelli instead.

354
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:25,533
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

355
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,234
You sure that's
what this means?

356
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:29,704
Could be they killed
Davey "The Box" Frateli.

357
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:30,905
- Ooh. - Ooh.
- Ooh.

358
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,540
Hold on, it
could also be

359
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:35,042
they killed Jimmy
"Tissue Paper" Scungili.

360
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:37,878
I just saw Jimmy yesterday
at my kid's christening.

361
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:39,447
So maybe
it wasn't Jimmy.

362
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:40,648
Maybe this
means they killed

363
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:42,450
Anthony "The Air
Around the Box" Minetti.

364
00:13:43,852 --> 00:13:45,152
Oh, no, they killed

365
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:47,054
Sal "Holding The Box
That We Can't Figure Out

366
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,223
What The Box Means" Casella.

367
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:51,325
Here, I got this
for you, too.

368
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,594
A bowling shirt?

369
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:54,929
You can wear
it anywhere.

370
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:56,864
To the beach,
a wedding on the beach,

371
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:59,400
beach graduation,
beach funeral,

372
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,869
business conference
which could be at a beach,

373
00:14:01,903 --> 00:14:03,003
a stroll
through the park,

374
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:05,172
should that park be
adjacent to a beach.

375
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:06,340
Thanks.

376
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,808
What, you
don't like it?

377
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:09,310
How's about we
go to the mall

378
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:10,845
and pick out something
you do like?

379
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,214
Well, I suppose
I could browse the toy store.

380
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:15,082
Possibly pick up
a new action figure.

381
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:16,584
That's the spirit.

382
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:18,738
All right, I better get out
of these professor clothes

383
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:20,755
before I kick
my own ass.

384
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:27,828
Okay, Stewie.
Pick anything you want, on me.

385
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:30,664
I don't know. I hate the toy
store this close to Christmas.

386
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:32,266
It's always
been picked clean.

387
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,934
There's plenty of
good stuff here.

388
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:36,937
Look at this, heavy
bronze sheep bookends.

389
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:39,373
What kid wouldn't want
to play with these?

390
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:41,075
"Baa. What are
you lookin' at?"

391
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:43,144
"Not much, that's
what I'm lookin' at."

392
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:44,412
"You want to have a go?"

393
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:45,546
"I'd watch what I say

394
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,615
with that other sheep
right behind you."

395
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,984
I played this as a kid.

396
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:52,019
Course, I had to do
it with ashtrays,

397
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:53,654
but I think the
sheep is better.

398
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,291
Wait a minute.
Who is that?

399
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:04,532
I think... I think
I know that boy.

400
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:20,781
Vinny,
that stocking cap.

401
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:21,982
It's mine.

402
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:25,686
That boy is me.

403
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,222
Of course.
It's me from the past.

404
00:15:28,256 --> 00:15:30,391
Several months ago,
I time-traveled ahead

405
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:31,926
to purchase
that Christmas toy.

406
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,094
I don't understand, so
I'm angry and hungry.

407
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,930
I'm gonna go
punch a sandwich.

408
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,300
Wow, good timing,
little fella.

409
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:40,601
This just
came out today.

410
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:43,337
Yeah, I kind of
knew that already.

411
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,806
The time machine return pad
is in the backpack

412
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,241
that other Stewie is wearing.

413
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:49,109
I must get
my hands on it, Vinny.

414
00:15:49,144 --> 00:15:50,344
Vinny?

415
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:52,213
That was a
tough sandwich.

416
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:53,881
As tough as your
mom's fat face.

417
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:55,316
Hey, leave my mother
out of this.

418
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,651
That woman stitched gloves
till she was 90.

419
00:15:57,686 --> 00:15:59,687
I heard she was
good with her hands.

420
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:00,921
Nice.

421
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:03,424
Hey, everybody, we got
a funny sandwich here.

422
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:06,627
Vinny, I need you
to get that Stewie

423
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:07,962
to take off
his backpack.

424
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:09,663
Listen, Stewie,
I'm not following.

425
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:10,931
I don't have time
to explain.

426
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,132
I've got to
steal something...

427
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,968
That's it. You've
already explained.

428
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:15,803
You got to steal
something. Got it.

429
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:17,371
Wait-Wait a sec,
what's your plan?

430
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:19,240
Trust me, I think
I know you well enough

431
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:20,941
to know how to distract
the other you.

432
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:26,947
Hey, how you doing?

433
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:29,183
This may sound a little
presumptuous of me,

434
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:31,619
but, uh, you ever
do any modeling?

435
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:32,853
Well, not
professionally,

436
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,522
but I-I-I have
thought about it.

437
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:35,723
You ought to.

438
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:38,192
What are you, like,
six-three? Six-four?

439
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:40,227
Y-Y-You're in...
you're in the ballpark.

440
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:41,729
I-I-I carry
myself taller.

441
00:16:41,763 --> 00:16:43,397
Good posture,
very important.

442
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:44,899
Oh, I agree.

443
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,534
Let me see, let me see.

444
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:50,037
That's good.

445
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:51,505
But I feel like that backpack

446
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,307
might be hiding
some figure flaws.

447
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:57,578
Well, that is where
you are wrong, my friend.

448
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:04,151
You know, my friends ask me,

449
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:06,587
"Stewie, why do you throw up
after every meal?"

450
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:07,955
This.

451
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:09,256
This is why.

452
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,061
All right, whatever
you gotta do, do it quick.

453
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:15,596
The other you
is in the back

454
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,998
changing into a pair of
tap shoes, for some reason.

455
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:20,267
♪ Animal crackers
in my soup... ♪

456
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:21,669
Hey, where did
that guy go?

457
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:24,438
Excellent. Now all I've got
to do is set the coordinates

458
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:25,973
to the moment before
Brian got killed

459
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,107
and I can save him.

460
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:29,410
Oh, yeah, Scott Bakula
and all that.

461
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:31,078
Yes, Vinny.
Scott Bakula.

462
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:33,347
Well, thank you
for everything.

463
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,548
You bet.

464
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,484
You realize if I save Brian,

465
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,320
my family won't
get another dog,

466
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:41,822
which means we
will never have met.

467
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:44,625
I'll probably
never see you again.

468
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:46,961
Oh.

469
00:17:46,995 --> 00:17:50,230
So, I think this is good-bye.

470
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:52,566
Hey, I'm man's best friend,

471
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:55,035
not some stupid baby's
best friend, right?

472
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:07,114
Good dog, Vinny.
Good dog.

473
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:09,984
Georgette,
I'm coming home.

474
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:11,785
Who the hell is Georgette?

475
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:16,991
Okay, Brian, I'm just
putting this out there,

476
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:20,160
but I'm a baby and only dicks
don't let babies win.

477
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:21,762
God, look at
this day, huh?

478
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:23,797
You know, usually, I'd be
sitting inside writing,

479
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:25,733
you'd be working on
one of your machines.

480
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:27,434
But here we are
enjoying it.

481
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:29,269
Yes, it is a nice
change of pace.

482
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:31,138
Oh, wait, I gotta
go grab my knee pads.

483
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:33,907
I was using them for...
for, for this other thing.

484
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,476
Anyway, I-I'll be
right back.

485
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:44,351
Brian, look out!

486
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:47,721
What the hell?

487
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:50,357
You're alive,
my friend.

488
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:51,425
What?
Course I'm alive.

489
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:52,693
What the hell's
going on here?

490
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:54,428
Brian, that car
killed you.

491
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:57,765
And when it did, a little
part of me died as well.

492
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,999
I couldn't live without you.

493
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:01,435
So I came back from the future
to save your life.

494
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:02,836
Whoa. Wait,
wait a minute.

495
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:04,004
What are you
talking about?

496
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,472
I saw you destroy
your time machine.

497
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:07,741
Yes, but luckily, I ran into
another me from the past,

498
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:09,910
so I stole his return pad
and came back here.

499
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:11,211
Oh, that reminds me.

500
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:13,247
I've gotta send this back
where it came from.

501
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:20,087
Hmm. I'm starting to think
that guy

502
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:21,655
wasn't a real modeling agent.

503
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,424
And I'm starting to think
that other guy

504
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,659
wasn't a real
penis-butt inspector.

505
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:29,163
Wow, Stewie, thank you
for saving my life.

506
00:19:29,197 --> 00:19:30,931
You know, a whole
lot of other families

507
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:32,966
would've just gotten a
different dog and moved on.

508
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:35,169
Oh, oh, we could,
we could never

509
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:37,204
do something
like that, Brian.

510
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:39,440
Stewie, what's
happening to you?

511
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:42,342
I think... My time line
is being erased.

512
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:45,279
The time line where
you died no longer exists.

513
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:48,382
Merry Christmas, Brian.

514
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:51,185
Hey, who were you
talking to out here?

515
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:54,321
A pretty awesome guy.

516
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:55,422
Oh, "pretty awesome guy."

517
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:56,690
Why don't you
marry him, huh?

518
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:57,725
All right, game on.

519
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,760
Aah!

520
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:02,730
Stew-S-A.
Stew-S-A. Stew-S-A.

521
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,439
Oven mitts.
Wow, thanks, Mom.

522
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:13,907
Now you don't
have to ask me

523
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,643
if everything is hot
before you touch it.

524
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:19,680
Are... are
the oven mitts hot?

525
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:22,316
Here you go, Stewie.
Merry Christmas.

526
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:29,823
Brian, it's-it's...
wonderful. Thank you.

527
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:32,092
Well, you gave me
the greatest gift of all.

528
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,761
I'll tell you
about it sometime.

529
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:34,928
Brian.

530
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:36,563
Are we pregnant?

531
00:20:36,598 --> 00:20:38,634
What? No, Stewie,
it's nothing like that.

532
00:20:38,635 --> 00:20:40,168
Okay, well, I
have to tell you,

533
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:41,303
I'm a little
bit relieved.

534
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:43,788
Look, just, just, thanks
for everything, Stewie.

535
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:46,692
You're my best friend
and I love you.

536
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:48,328
All I can say, Brian,

537
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:51,093
is you've been making
really creepy eye contact

538
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:53,790
with me all morning
and I want it to stop right now.
