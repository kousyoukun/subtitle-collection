� it seems today

Announcer (over tv):
We now return to <i>home alone</i>
<i>with competent robbers.</i>

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,978
Hey, be careful. There's
cars on the floor here.

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,713
Thanks.
That's weird, huh?

13
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,181
Yeah. The doorknob
was really hot,

14
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,717
But I just let go instead
of holding onto it.

15
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,053
And there's some ice
on the stairs to the basement,

16
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:56,488
So I guess just
don't go down there.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,824
Just so you guys know,
I have a tarantula.

18
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,062
Well, now there
are no witnesses.

19
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,664
Come on, everybody,
let's go to the mall.

20
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,733
It's time for the
christmas carnival.

21
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,069
It's stewie's
first christmas.

22
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,070
Again?

23
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:14,106
I love the
christmas carnival!

24
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,340
Chris, calm down.

25
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,909
You're giving
yourself a nosebleed.

26
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,011
You know, the best thing
about the quahog mall

27
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:21,513
Is going into tiffany's
and doing everything possible

28
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,882
To make 'em think I might
actually buy something.

29
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,085
Oh, this is lovely.
Just lovely.

30
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,286
How much is this?

31
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,854
$1,200.

32
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:29,955
Great, great.

33
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,357
That's all? A-and how late
are you open this evening?

34
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,358
Until 7:00.

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,426
Perfect, perfect.

36
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,728
And you accept
credit cards and cash?
Yes.

37
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,930
And what's your name?

38
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,032
I want to make sure you
get credit for this sale.

39
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,234
Evan.
Oh, that's a great name.

40
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,769
Oh, and these watches here,

41
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,105
If I wanted to get 11 of them
for different groomsmen,

42
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,974
Could they each get
engraved individually?
Yes.

43
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,642
And you do that on site?
Yes.

44
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:54,713
Fantastic. Now, the groomsmen's
names are blake, hayden, edgar,

45
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,916
Blake d., elliott,
milo, cooper...

46
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,751
Why aren't you writing
any of these down?

47
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,354
You're wearing sbarro
wrappers for shoes, sir.

48
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,191
There <i>may</i> have been
a trade.

49
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,801
Hey, nice outfit.

50
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,137
Fancy pair of shoes, too.

51
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,939
Do you, do you only use
adjectives sarcastically?

52
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:24,109
Great question,
smart guy.

53
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,944
What the hell?
Where's all the decorations?

54
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,112
And the big christmas tree?

55
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,147
Oh, look, there's santa.

56
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,314
Peter, no.

57
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,949
That's a hells angel.

58
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:31,950
What do you want?

59
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:32,818
Meth?

60
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,852
Okay.

61
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,088
There's no
christmas carnival, dad.

62
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,456
You seem to know
a lot about this, meg.

63
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,423
What did you do?

64
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,192
No christmas carnival?

65
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:41,760
Whoever is responsible
for this

66
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,295
Shall suffer
my eternal wrath.

67
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:44,930
(chuckles)
who's this guy?

68
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,532
Tough don't sell
in curly-toed shoes.

69
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:47,966
Leave me alone.

70
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:51,036
Why don't you go bother
the cologne salesman at macy's?

71
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,671
I want something I
can wear on the street

72
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,340
That a broad can smell
on a fire escape.

73
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,709
There's gotta be
an explanation for this.

74
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,111
Let's ask that security guard

75
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,113
Who has everything on
his belt except a gun.

76
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:03,115
E-excuse me, sir?

77
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:03,982
It's "officer."

78
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,318
No, it's not.
It's barely "sir."

79
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,519
Yeah, I know.

80
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,555
Where is
the christmas carnival?

81
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,123
Canceled.
I don't know why.

82
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,492
I'm just a small cog
in this operation.

83
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:14,860
You hear that, dad?

84
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,396
You're not the only one
around here with a small cog.

85
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,199
Peter and lois:
I told you that
in confidence, chris.

86
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,167
Daddy, where's santa?

87
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,036
Was he killed by muslims?

88
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,971
Oh, my god,
poor stewie.

89
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,006
He's so
disappointed.

90
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,975
Of course he is, lois.
I feel the same way.

91
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,977
How come every time
I'm feelin' happy,

92
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,812
Somebody's gotta
come along and ruin it?

93
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,415
Are you enjoying
your coffee, sir?

94
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,350
Yeah, it's very
smooth. Good flavor.

95
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:41,587
What if we told you that
we secretly replaced your coffee

96
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,988
With folgers crystals?

97
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,389
Wouldn't you
feel like a dumbass?

98
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,491
'cause of how you just
raved about it just now?

99
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,594
You stupid
son of a bitch.

100
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,102
Boy, stewie was
really upset

101
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,504
About the christmas
carnival being canceled.

102
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,906
He's been acting
out all week.

103
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,008
Ah, I'm sure he'll
be over it in no time.

104
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,611
Besides, how much trouble
can he cause? He's a baby.

105
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,149
(hisses)

106
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,891
Announcer (over tv):
We now return to
<i>miracle on 134th street.</i>

107
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,694
Oh, my god, I left
my phone in my car.

108
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,197
Wow, it's still there.

109
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,972
Hey, I've been askin' around
about this carnival thing.

110
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,041
Turns out I know a guy
who knows a guy

111
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,976
Who knows another guy
who knows a girl,

112
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,312
Which is weird because they
don't usually know nothin',

113
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,948
Who says the carnival was
canceled by the mall's owner,

114
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,483
Some guy named
carter pewterschmidt.

115
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,984
Oh, my god.

116
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,920
So I got another guy workin'
on findin' out who that is.

117
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:49,955
It's my father.

118
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,924
Oh! This is a twist
I did not expect.

119
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:56,228
Oh! Excuse me, I'm just gonna
have to "oh" this out

120
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,230
Until I'm not
surprised anymore.

121
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,899
Oh! Oh! Oh.

122
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,069
Oh... Oh. Oh.

123
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,071
Lois, before I get mad
at your dad,

124
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,806
H-he isn't the little
caesars guy, is he?

125
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,007
No, peter,
we've been through this.

126
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,009
Good. I could never
be mad at that guy.

127
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,978
He says my favorite word
twice in a row.

128
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,846
Now, I'm gonna go
talk to your father

129
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,782
And get him to bring back
the christmas carnival.

130
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,250
Peter, I don't think
that's gonna work.

131
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,818
Sure, it will.

132
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,920
The nerve of your dad, takin'
the fun out of christmas,

133
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,156
Like some kind of
gluten-free santa.

134
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,692
Hey. Hey,
what's in these?

135
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:27,926
Huh?

136
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,128
I'm okay if it's,
like, coconut flour.

137
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,631
But anything with actual
grains, I can't do.

138
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,965
I'm not sure.

139
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,201
Well, who <i>is</i> sure?

140
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,207
(squeaking)

141
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,347
Woman:
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
there's a man here

142
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,949
Who says he's the guy whose
picture is on all the money.

143
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,617
Holy cow. Send him in.

144
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,320
Griffin.

145
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,023
That's right, and this is my
own <i>people</i> magazine from home

146
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,624
And not from your
waiting room just now,

147
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,560
And why did you cancel
the christmas carnival?

148
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,894
Because I hate christmas.

149
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,330
You know what it's like being
rich at christmas, griffin?

150
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,900
Everyone expects an expensive
present, and I get nothing.

151
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,670
Did you... Did you just have
your hand in my fish tank?

152
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,004
No.

153
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:13,972
Sheesh, carter,
you know what?

154
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,174
I am gonna help you find
the christmas spirit

155
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,576
So you bring back
the carnival.

156
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:18,810
Look, are we done here?

157
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,212
Um, yeah, uh, just
one more thing.

158
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,981
Can I choose one
thing in your office
to take home with me?

159
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,316
No.

160
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:28,153
Aw, too bad. 'cause I
was gonna choose you.

161
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,455
You're weird.
You're a weird guy.

162
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,231
No. No-no, no.

163
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,499
I want to zip it.

164
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,935
(grunts)

165
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,605
It's okay, peter,
you're good at other stuff.

166
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,039
So you're gonna
help your old man

167
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,108
Find his christmas
spirit again, huh?

168
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,877
Oh, yeah, that
sounds real bad,

169
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,779
Her father don't
like christmas.

170
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,014
My father was drowned
to death in a birdbath

171
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,682
By an officer
of the law.

172
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:58,850
His will just said,

173
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,119
"kick jimmy in the sack
for me. Go, eagles."

174
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,687
My sympathies, vinny.

175
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,956
Don't worry about it,
he was a scumbag.

176
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,525
Are you sure
about this, peter?

177
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,593
I mean, I know
stewie was disappointed

178
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,462
About the carnival,
but he'll get over it.

179
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,097
He's a happy,
resilient baby.

180
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,432
I don't know, lois.

181
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,966
I feel like if we
don't do something,

182
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,401
Stewie's first
words are gonna be,

183
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,869
"why did you
kill christmas?"

184
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,304
And I want the
carnival back, too.

185
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,873
You know, I know I'm usually
all business, but deep down,

186
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,109
You know what the thing
is that keeps me going

187
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:24,910
More than
anything else?

188
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,278
Wonder.

189
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,246
A sense of wonder.

190
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,582
Well, you have your work
cut out for you, peter.

191
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,418
My father's always
hated christmas.

192
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,620
Hey, happy June 16.

193
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,722
Thought I'd see how
you like it when someone

194
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,225
Breaks into your house
and touches all your stuff.

195
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,827
Hey. Knock it off.

196
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,762
I'm touching this.
And this over here.

197
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,864
You're a creep,
is my point.

198
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,402
All right, carter, now,
you know what's guaranteed

199
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:51,937
To put you
in the holiday mood?

200
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,004
Write a christmas letter

201
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,606
To all your friends
and relatives.

202
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,775
And keep in mind,
it's traditional to embellish

203
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,477
A little bit to make
yourself look better.

204
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,078
"peter had a
great year,

205
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,746
"and is now starting
quarterback

206
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,748
For the jacksonville
jaguars."

207
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,084
What? People can easily
fact-check this.

208
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,819
Yeah, who has the time?
Keep reading.

209
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,988
"chris refurbished a
vintage motorcycle,

210
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,756
"and stewie can
slam-dunk a basketball

211
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,358
From a standing
start..."

212
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,793
Peter, that's
impossible.

213
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,094
Read what it says
about you.

214
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,996
"lois's father,
carter pewterschmidt,

215
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,998
Bought a small stool
for his balls."

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,299
Damn it, I'm not
proud of that.

217
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,201
Well, you have to
throw in some real facts.

218
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,737
That's what gives
the newsletter credibility.

219
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,975
Now, everyone knows
the best way to get
the christmas spirit

220
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:33,144
Is to drink a whole lot
of thick, frothy eggnog.

221
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:33,945
So get going.

222
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:34,980
I don't like eggnog.

223
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,047
Drink the nog, carter.

224
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,382
I don't... I don't want to.

225
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,885
Take it, carter.
Take all the nog.

226
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,354
(coughs)

227
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,555
No.

228
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,023
Yeah, you like that nog.

229
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,191
Don't spit
the nog out.

230
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,326
Now look at the
camera for a pov shot.

231
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,529
Say thank you with
the nog in your mouth.

232
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,663
Thank you.
Louder.

233
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,964
Thank you.

234
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,400
Good, now go down
to the hotel lobby
and check out

235
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,735
With nog all
over your face.

236
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:57,836
All right.

237
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,804
You know, I still
don't like christmas,

238
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,040
But I kind of like
what we just did.

239
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,745
Okay, carter, a big part
of christmas is masturbating

240
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,914
Like you would any other day
but feeling guilty about it

241
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,782
Because it's christmas.

242
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,857
(sighs) what's
wrong with me?

243
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:19,858
Griffin,
this isn't working.

244
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,092
What? What do you mean?

245
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,561
I-I'm not getting
the holiday spirit,

246
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,762
So you can stop trying.

247
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,196
But carter, it's
not just for me.

248
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,598
Think about stewie.

249
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,400
He's all upset 'cause
there's no carnival.

250
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,901
Heh.
Different dog.

251
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,836
Yeah, this one's, like,
italian or something.

252
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,071
Anyway, I think
we're done here.

253
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,673
No christmas carnival.

254
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,008
Wow, carter. I had no
idea you were jewish.

255
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,277
What? Is... Is that
how this is coming off?

256
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,612
Yeah, kind of.

257
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,113
I mean, that's what
everyone's saying.

258
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,748
People think I'm jewish?

259
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,396
Oh, this christmas carnival
has everything. Games, food.

260
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,132
Oh, my god, it's the carolers
from <i>a christmas story.</i>

261
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,936
� deck the harrs
with boughs of horry �

262
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,540
� fa ra ra ra ra
ra ra ra ra �

263
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,275
That's right, america,
don't forget.

264
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,211
Your beloved holiday movie
is incredibly racist.

265
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,280
And flom
not that rong ago.

266
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,082
What's wrong with you,
stews?

267
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,984
You're next up
to see the big guy himself

268
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,286
And you look like a piece
of spaghetti on the street.

269
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,288
I don't know. I thought
having the carnival back

270
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,589
Would make me happy,

271
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,725
But it still feels like
something's missing.

272
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,460
Yeah, it's always somethin'.

273
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,829
Like when I finally got
to sleep with mary lou gallo.

274
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,964
She had a look,
but when you got up close,

275
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,066
She also had a smell.

276
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,068
Oh, stewie, you're next.

277
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,070
Ho ho ho.

278
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,472
Mall santa is
brought to you

279
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,674
In part this season
by chipotle.

280
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,510
Between good and
garbage, it's chipotle.

281
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,445
So, what do you want
for christmas?

282
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,347
Oh, what do I want
for christmas?

283
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,750
What <i>do</i> I want
for christmas?

284
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,525
You know what I want
for christmas?

285
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,460
I want my friend back.

286
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,762
Your friend?

287
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,030
Yes. My best friend.

288
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,098
My dog, brian.

289
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,633
He's dead.

290
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,835
It's our first christmas
without him

291
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,538
And no one's even
mentioned his name.

292
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,176
I don't care about this stupid
carnival or christmas.

293
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,945
I don't care about
anything except brian.

294
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:24,082
I want brian.
(sobs)

295
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,953
You want me to put a
dead dog under your tree?

296
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,889
Yes.

297
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,894
(sniffles) and, uh,

298
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,696
I-I'd like
a bike, too.

299
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,672
Announcer:
We now return to <i>the year</i>
<i>without a santa claus or sex.</i>

300
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:48,907
Daddy, where's
santa clau...

301
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,075
I don't know, okay?!

302
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,242
Should I ask mom?

303
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,746
(laughs) I don't know,
she's so busy with her job.

304
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,015
Vinny:
Hello there, stewart.

305
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,983
What's this?
What are you doing, vinny?

306
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,685
Vinny? Who's vinny?

307
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:04,255
My name is brian,
aka your favorite dog.

308
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,091
Hey, whose leg do
you gotta gagoosh

309
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,860
To get an amaretto di
saronno around here?

310
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,695
Oh, forget it, vinny.
You're not brian.

311
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,597
Come on, I went through
a lot of trouble.

312
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,700
For example, I know brian
was rather into politics,

313
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,035
So I read the newspaper.

314
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,171
What is goin' on with
all these politics, huh?

315
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,941
Well, that is about brian's
level of political awareness.

316
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,342
Yeah, and you know
how brian wrote

317
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,610
<i>Wish it, want it, do it?</i>

318
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,945
Well, I wrote
a book, too.

319
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,079
A little
something called

320
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,614
<i>Wish it, want it,</i>
<i>you blew it.</i>

321
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:30,849
Really?

322
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,718
Yup. Let me read
you an expert.

323
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,386
"you wish you
were a millionaire.

324
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,622
"you want more money.
Guess what.

325
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,790
"you blew it.

326
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,525
"you wish you could
change the neighborhood.

327
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,560
"you want to be
a selectman.

328
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,795
"you blew it.

329
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,630
"you wish you could
open up a restaurant.

330
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,632
"you did not want to
pay protection money.

331
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,867
"knock, knock.
Who's there?

332
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,034
You blew it."

333
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:50,935
You blew it who?

334
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,103
You blew it bad.

335
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,372
You know what the last
page of the book is?

336
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,975
A mirror. So you can see
exactly who blew it.

337
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:57,909
Being you.

338
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,944
Look, I appreciate
all this, vinny,

339
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,080
But there's only one brian,

340
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,816
And it's tough for me
that he's gone,

341
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:07,485
Especially around the holidays.

342
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,888
Okay, I know what'll
cheer you up.

343
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,223
How about you open up one
of those christmas presents?

344
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,458
It's from me.

345
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,493
Merry christmas.

346
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,829
What the hell?
There's a foot in this box.

347
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,964
That was supposed to
go to somebody else.

348
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,132
I'm very sorry.

349
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,467
Well, my friends,

350
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,069
I think johnny "the foot"
giatelli is dead.

351
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,271
Oh no.

352
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,007
They killed frankie
"choo-choo" chinelli instead.

353
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,241
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

354
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,110
You sure that's
what this means?

355
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,445
Could be they killed
davey "the box" frateli.

356
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,680
Ooh.
Ooh.
Ooh.

357
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,248
Hold on, it
could also be

358
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,818
They killed jimmy
"tissue paper" scungili.

359
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,620
I just saw jimmy yesterday
at my kid's christening.

360
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,088
So maybe
it wasn't jimmy.

361
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,323
Maybe this
means they killed

362
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,091
Anthony "the air
around the box" minetti.

363
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,526
(gunshot)

364
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,961
Oh, no, they killed

365
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,830
Sal "holding the box
that we can't figure out

366
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,032
What the box means" casella.

367
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,201
Here, I got this
for you, too.

368
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,269
A bowling shirt?

369
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,671
You can wear
it anywhere.

370
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,673
To the beach,
a wedding on the beach,

371
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,108
Beach graduation,
beach funeral,

372
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,678
Business conference
which could be at a beach,

373
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,846
A stroll
through the park,

374
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,048
Should that park be
adjacent to a beach.

375
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,015
Thanks.

376
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,617
What, you
don't like it?

377
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:13,985
How's about we
go to the mall

378
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,653
And pick out something
you do like?

379
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,122
Well, I suppose
I could browse the toy store.

380
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,891
Possibly pick up
a new action figure.

381
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,292
That's the spirit.

382
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,461
All right, I better get out
of these professor clothes

383
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,530
Before I kick
my own ass.

384
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,570
Okay, stewie.
Pick anything you want, on me.

385
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,373
I don't know. I hate the toy
store this close to christmas.

386
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,141
It's always
been picked clean.

387
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,710
There's plenty of
good stuff here.

388
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,713
Look at this, heavy
bronze sheep bookends.

389
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,015
What kid wouldn't want
to play with these?

390
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,884
"baa. What are
you lookin' at?"

391
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,986
"not much, that's
what I'm lookin' at."

392
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,053
"you want to have a go?"

393
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,221
"I'd watch what I say

394
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,323
With that other sheep
right behind you."

395
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,759
I played this as a kid.

396
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,828
Course, I had to do
it with ashtrays,

397
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,396
But I think the
sheep is better.

398
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,000
Wait a minute.
Who is that?

399
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,274
I think... I think
I know that boy.

400
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,556
Vinny,
that stocking cap.

401
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:26,824
It's mine.

402
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,428
That boy is me.

403
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,097
Of course.
It's me from the past.

404
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,066
Several months ago,
I time-traveled ahead

405
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,734
To purchase
that christmas toy.

406
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,937
I don't understand, so
I'm angry and hungry.

407
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,772
I'm gonna go
punch a sandwich.

408
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,908
Wow, good timing,
little fella.

409
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,276
This just
came out today.

410
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,946
(chuckling):
Yeah, I kind of
knew that already.

411
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,548
The time machine return pad
is in the backpack

412
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,083
That other stewie is wearing.

413
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,918
I must get
my hands on it, vinny.

414
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,953
Vinny?

415
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,055
That was a
tough sandwich.

416
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,623
As tough as your
mom's fat face.

417
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,924
Hey, leave my mother
out of this.

418
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,427
That woman stitched gloves
till she was 90.

419
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,462
I heard she was
good with her hands.

420
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,763
Nice.

421
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,132
Hey, everybody, we got
a funny sandwich here.

422
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,467
(bleep) (bleep).

423
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,402
Vinny, I need you
to get that stewie

424
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,804
To take off
his backpack.

425
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,439
Listen, stewie,
I'm not following.

426
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,773
I don't have time
to explain.

427
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,008
I've got to
steal something...

428
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,810
That's it. You've
already explained.

429
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,611
You got to steal
something. Got it.

430
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,080
Wait-wait a sec,
what's your plan?

431
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,148
Trust me, I think
I know you well enough

432
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,817
To know how to distract
the other you.

433
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,756
Hey, how you doing?

434
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,025
This may sound a little
presumptuous of me,

435
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,327
But, uh, you ever
do any modeling?

436
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,628
Well, not
professionally,

437
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,197
But I-I-I have
thought about it.

438
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,465
You ought to.

439
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,034
What are you, like,
six-three? Six-four?

440
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,103
Y-y-you're in...
You're in the ballpark.

441
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,471
I-I-I carry
myself taller.

442
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,039
Good posture,
very important.

443
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,674
Oh, I agree.

444
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,242
Let me see, let me see.

445
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,846
That's good.

446
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,180
But I feel like that backpack

447
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,949
Might be hiding
some figure flaws.

448
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:02,387
(laughs) well, that is where
you are wrong, my friend.

449
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,027
You know, my friends ask me,

450
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,329
"stewie, why do you throw up
after every meal?"

451
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,797
This.

452
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,198
This is why.

453
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,903
All right, whatever
you gotta do, do it quick.

454
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,338
The other you
is in the back

455
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,840
Changing into a pair of
tap shoes, for some reason.

456
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,909
Other stewie:
� animal crackers
in my soup... �

457
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,411
Hey, where did
that guy go?

458
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:29,147
Excellent. Now all I've got
to do is set the coordinates

459
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,815
To the moment before
brian got killed

460
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:31,983
And I can save him.

461
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,085
Oh, yeah, scott bakula
and all that.

462
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,920
Yes, vinny.
Scott bakula.

463
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,022
Well, thank you
for everything.

464
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,257
You bet.

465
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,193
You realize if I save brian,

466
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,995
My family won't
get another dog,

467
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,597
Which means we
will never have met.

468
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,333
I'll probably
never see you again.

469
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,736
Oh.

470
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:55,073
So, I think this is good-bye.

471
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,241
Hey, I'm man's best friend,

472
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,844
Not some stupid baby's
best friend, right?

473
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,023
Good dog, vinny.
Good dog.

474
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,859
Georgette,
I'm coming home.

475
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,627
Who the hell is georgette?

476
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,866
Okay, brian, I'm just
putting this out there,

477
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:25,069
But I'm a baby and only dicks
don't let babies win.

478
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,571
God, look at
this day, huh?

479
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,606
You know, usually, I'd be
sitting inside writing,

480
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,541
You'd be working on
one of your machines.

481
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,110
But here we are
enjoying it.

482
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,911
Yes, it is a nice
change of pace.

483
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,980
Oh, wait, I gotta
go grab my knee pads.

484
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,716
I was using them for...
For, for this other thing.

485
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,184
Anyway, I-I'll be
right back.

486
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,026
Brian, look out!

487
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,463
What the hell?

488
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,999
You're alive,
my friend.

489
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,100
What?
Course I'm alive.

490
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,435
What the hell's
going on here?

491
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,103
Brian, that car
killed you.

492
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,607
And when it did, a little
part of me died as well.

493
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,908
I couldn't live without you.

494
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,177
So I came back from the future
to save your life.

495
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,678
Whoa. Wait,
wait a minute.

496
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,913
What are you
talking about?

497
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,248
I saw you destroy
your time machine.

498
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,583
Yes, but luckily, I ran into
another me from the past,

499
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,752
So I stole his return pad
and came back here.

500
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,120
Oh, that reminds me.

501
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,189
I've gotta send this back
where it came from.

502
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,962
Hmm. I'm starting to think
that guy

503
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,430
Wasn't a real modeling agent.

504
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,132
And I'm starting to think
that other guy

505
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,434
Wasn't a real
penis-butt inspector.

506
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:34,038
Wow, stewie, thank you
for saving my life.

507
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,773
You know, a whole
lot of other families

508
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,808
Would've just gotten a
different dog and moved on.

509
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,044
Oh, oh, we could,
we could never

510
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,113
Do something
like that, brian.

511
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,148
Stewie, what's
happening to you?

512
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,018
I think... My time line
is being erased.

513
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,221
The time line where
you died no longer exists.

514
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,090
Merry christmas, brian.

515
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,027
Hey, who were you
talking to out here?

516
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,963
A pretty awesome guy.

517
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,064
Oh, "pretty awesome guy."

518
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,399
Why don't you
marry him, huh?

519
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,466
All right, game on.

520
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,502
Aah!
(imitates crowd cheering)

521
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,471
Stew-s-a.
Stew-s-a. Stew-s-a.

522
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:17,081
Oven mitts.
Wow, thanks, mom.

523
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,683
Now you don't
have to ask me

524
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,352
If everything is hot
before you touch it.

525
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,388
Are... Are
the oven mitts hot?

526
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,225
Here you go, stewie.
Merry christmas.

527
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,565
Brian, it's-it's...
Wonderful. Thank you.

528
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,867
Well, you gave me
the greatest gift of all.

529
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,436
I'll tell you
about it sometime.

530
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,670
Brian.

531
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,205
Are we pregnant?

532
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,873
What? No, stewie,
it's nothing like that.

533
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,342
Okay, well, I
have to tell you,

534
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,509
I'm a little
bit relieved.

535
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:49,113
Look, just, just, thanks
for everything, stewie.

536
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:52,917
You're my best friend
and I love you.

537
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,585
All I can say, brian,
is you've been making
really creepy eye contact

538
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,388
With me all morning
and I want it to
stop right now.

539
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,656
