Morning, Stella.

11
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:38,837
Morning, Peter.

12
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,539
Hey, listen, I-I got to
ask you something.

13
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,341
Last night, I heard,
uh, the song

14
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,909
"Pour Some Sugar On Me,"

15
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:46,178
and-and this question
popped into my head.

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,914
Are you-- and please say
yes-- are you related--

17
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,350
and even if you're not, please
say yes-- are you related to--

18
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,318
and please say yes
because I need the attention

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,188
from my friends-- are you
related to Def Leppard?

20
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,890
Griffin, can I talk
to you privately?

21
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,725
Stella, turn around.

22
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,728
You know, that is one nice thing
about having a deaf coworker.

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,197
Well, that and I can work
on my verbal sound effects

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,532
and not feel
self-conscious about

25
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,000
the ones that aren't
quite there yet.

26
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,902
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:12,571
I'm talking about this:
shabba dabba dabba dabba dabba.

28
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,239
That's a helicopter
hovering over a woman

29
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,541
swimming in her pool.

30
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:16,708
I also do animals.

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,943
Here's a mouse.

32
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,845
(high-pitched):
Mouse?

33
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,346
Oh, that one's ready.

34
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,115
Griffin, I actually
came to tell you

35
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:25,751
that you're being promoted
to forklift operator.

36
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,052
Really? That's awesome!

37
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,021
Yeah, Frank retired, and
since you're already required

38
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,289
to wear a helmet here--

39
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,957
which, by the way,
put on your helmet.

40
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,125
Oh, sorry.

41
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:34,960
Anyway, the job is yours.

42
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,962
Which means you'll be
receiving a five percent raise.

43
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,597
Wow, a raise!

44
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,033
I guess this means I can
afford to set up this cutaway

45
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,135

new transition.

Are you nuts?
No way you can chug that.

138
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,095
Peter, put
the paper down.

139
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,597
Okay, kids,
off to school.

140
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,798
Now, I know
it's picture day,

141
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,300
but we can't
afford them anymore,

142
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,835
so just run
behind another kid

143
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,903
when they're getting
their picture taken.

144
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,310
Peter, we should talk
about this job situation.

145
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,811
Our savings are
getting pretty low.

146
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,912
You know,
actually, Peter,

147
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,314
there's a lot
of job training programs

148
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,415
sponsored by the state

149
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,283
that could help you
get the skills you need

150
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,318
for another occupation.

151
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,919
You know, Brian,
you could get a job.

152
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,154
I have a job.

153
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,356
I-I'm a writer, Peter.
I'm working right now.

154
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,524
See this,
all of this?

155
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,926
This is the raw material
of a picture of life

156
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,628
that I'm gonna
paint with words.

157
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,430
Yesterday, it took you
30 minutes

158
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,265
to lap up a cold cut
off the floor.

159
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,967
That's my process!

160
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,168
It's been three weeks

161
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,803

a single job lead.

162
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:25,971
Oh, that's not true.

163
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,540
I came really close
with that job at the school.

164
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,175
So, what makes you want
to be a crossing guard?

165
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,810
I don't know, I just
thought it would be cool

166
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:35,280
to decide which kids do
and don't get hit by a car.

167
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:38,016
Well, Peter, since you've been
having such a tough time,

168
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,019
I was thinking, maybe I
should look for a job.

169
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,955
Lois, I'll be damned if I will
let my wife be a prostitute.

170
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,391
What? No, I'll get
a regular job.

171
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,360
(laughs) What,
like a lawyer?

172
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,663
Peter, there are jobs for women
between prostitute and lawyer.

173
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,697
Wartime nurse?

174
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,732
We need money.

175
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,166
I'm gonna look
for a job.

176
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,869
(sighs) I guess you should;
and that'll give me more time

177
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,238
to focus on expanding
my record collection.

178
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
How's this one?
Oh, Bach.

179
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,975
Is very good.
I recommend.

180
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:04,976
And this one?

181
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,511
Oh, Mozart.

182
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:07,812
The boy genius.

183
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:08,847
The best.

184
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:09,848
Okay, how about this?

185
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,483
Ooh, Debussy.

186
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,918
I love Debussy.

187
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,654
Sometimes all I can
think about is Debussy.

188
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,322
Oh, look at the pianist.

189
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,558
The pianist is so good
with Debussy.

190
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,059
So, you like
his early work?

191
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,028
Oh, yes,
when Debussy was young,

192
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,596
that's when
you want Debussy.

193
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:25,897
Okay, I'll
take these two.

194
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,032
Very good, sir.

195
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,568
Just make sure
you finish on the Bach.

196
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,403
Never finish on Debussy.

197
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,904
(applause)

198
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,973
CROWD:
Bravo! Bravo!

199
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,745
(deep breath)

200
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,047
All right,
you can do this.

201
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,381
You've shopped here for years.

202
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,784
You know this place
like the back of your hand.

203
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,388
Now, Mrs. Griffin, where
did you go to college?

204
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,456
Groceries.

205
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,458
Are you available
to work weekends?

206
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,759
Groceries.

207
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,794
Very impressive.

208
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,262
This next one is
a trick question.

209
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,530
Groceries?

210
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,764
I'm hired.

211
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,366
Welcome aboard.

212
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,572
Hey, guys,
great news.

213
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,641
You're looking at
the new assistant store manager

214
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:10,742
of Stop 'N Shop.

215
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,310
You got a job
at the grocery store?

216
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,778
That's great!

217
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,114
You get to see all the food
before it's famous.

218
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,215
Well, you know
you've made it

219
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,984
when you've got
a teenage boss.

220
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,085
Lois, that's awesome!

221
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,920
Now I can spend
my days at The Clam

222
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,154
like we've always
talked about.

223
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,590
No, Peter, if I'm gonna
be out of the house working,

224
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,093
you're gonna have to take over
for me in the house.

225
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,928
Wait, wait, what,
I-I got to do what you do?

226
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,063
Spending the whole day
taking Tylenol PMs

227
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,798
and straddling
the bath faucet?

228
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,134
Well, the guy knows what's going
on here, I'll give him that.

229
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,970
No, I mean, you're gonna need to
cook the meals and do laundry

230
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,106
and take care of Stewie,
like I've been doing.

231
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,107
Are you serious?

232
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,008
Dad's gonna
run the house?

233
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,275
Hey, I can do it.

234
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,444
I mean, it can't be
any harder than that job

235
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,279
I used to have
at the bowling alley.

236
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,280
Bowlarama.

237
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,915
Yes, we're open.

238
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,151
Oh, yes, we have a wide
selection of balls

239
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,954
that are way too heavy
or have too-small finger holes.

240
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,956
Uh, no, you will not
be able to do anything

241
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,291
with your wrist
for seven days afterward.

242
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,861
Yes, sir, all of the joysticks
in the arcade

243
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,430
are completely covered in pizza
grease, no worries there.

244
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,765
What's that?

245
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,300
Oh, absolutely, there is always
a group of teenagers

246
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,870
throwing the ball real hard
and scaring everyone.

247
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:15,140
No, there is no smoking,
but we do let you smoke.

248
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,409
Yes, it's all terrible,
come on down.

249
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,349
Why are you doing laundry
in the dishwasher?

250
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,017
Oh, I can't use
the washing machine;

251
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,552
it's really been
acting up lately.

252
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,121
What the hell?

253
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,190
What's going on
down here?

254
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,658
This is washing
machine stuff.

255
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,527
Go back upstairs,
suck-bag.

256
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,633
All right, Stewie, I'm gonna
change your diaper now.

257
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:44,302
Which, unfortunately, means
I have to touch your privates.

258
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,738
All right, so here I
come with the cloth.

259
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,840
Okay? This is
not sexual.

260
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:52,010
All right, I've made contact
with your undercarriage.

261
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,079
I am moving it upwards
with a cupped hand.

262
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,847
I'm looking you
in the eye now.

263
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,148
Please meet my gaze.

264
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,416
And we're done.

265
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,152
That was intense.

266
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,190
All right, kids,
you are really gonna love

267
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,158
these Cornish game hens
I cooked for dinner.

268
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Now, I don't want
to pat myself on the back,

269
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,529
but I worked all day
getting 'em just right...

270
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,931
Holy crap!

271
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,532
Oh, my God.

272
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:15,934
Then that means...

273
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,737
And that also means...

274
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,074
You know what, Peter?

275
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,111
You tried hard, and you
still earned that wine.

276
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,017
I'm home.

277
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,053
Wow, Peter,
the house looks amazing.

278
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,521
Yeah, well, let's
take off our shoes

279
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,223
and try to keep
it that way, huh?

280
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,558
No, really, Peter,
it seems like you've really

281
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,093
taken to being
a househusband.

282
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,728
Well, it hasn't
been easy.

283
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,929
Between doing the
laundry and vacuuming,

284
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,232
I barely had time to
put on a nice sweater

285
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,834
and clasp a cup of
tea with two hands.

286
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,173
(sighs):
Ah.

287
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,244
And now to tie this sweater
around my waist

288
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,479
and walk around
the neighborhood.

289
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,715
Well, what do you say
I reward you

290
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,150
for all your hard work?

291
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,885
Geez, Lois, is that
all you think about?

292
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:07,952
I'm tired.

293
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:08,987
Come on, Peter.

294
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:09,988
I need this release.

295
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,322
I had a long
day at work.

296
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,924
Oh, work.

297
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,459
I suppose work
is why you missed

298
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,060
Chris's father-son picnic.

299
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,129
Peter, you're still
Chris's father.

300
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,297
Why can't you just listen

301
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,166
instead of trying
to fix everything?!

302
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,735
Get in here, Peter.

303
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,103
Don't you want to have sex?

304
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,939
I don't think we've done it
since I started working.

305
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,274
Yeah, I guess you're right.

306
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,844
Come on, where's my big,
strong man?

307
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,814
Putting on one of your
dress shirts to look sexy.

308
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,184
(purrs)

309
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,451
Mmm.

310
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,587
I want to do it on top
of the comforter.

311
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,088
I don't care if
we make streaks.

312
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,323
Well, of course <i>you</i> don't,

313
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,958
you're not the one
who cleans it.

314
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,294
Peter, just shut
up and take me!

315
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,362
(both grunting)

316
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:54,999
Peter, get up! Get up!

317
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,634
There's a caterpillar
in the bed!

318
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,703
Oh, that's, uh...
that's me.

319
00:13:58,705 --> 00:13:59,771
What?

320
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:01,306
How do I put this
delicately?

321
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,809
My hog cannot partake
in the slop this evening.

322
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,179
Peter, are you having
trouble getting... ready?

323
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,114
Yes, obviously,
I'm having trouble!

324
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,050
Well, somebody's gonna
have sex with me.

325
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,151
Lois, don't say that.

326
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,220
Quagmire will show up
like the Road Runner.

327
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,125
It's okay, your vagina's
just a painted-on hole.

328
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,069
Oh, Peter,
you're up.

329
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,470
That's not
what I heard.

330
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,372
(both laugh)

331
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,907
Hey, Peter, you want
a little something

332
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,141
to put in that
orange juice?

333
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,176
What? Why? It's 9:00 a.m.

334
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,477
Well, I
figured you'd

335
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,145
like to start your day
with a stiff one.

336
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,714
(laughter)

337
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,082
You can't
get a boner!

338
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,818
You're a failure as
a man and a father.

339
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,020
Peter, it's nothing
to get upset about.

340
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,555
There's treatments
available.

341
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,923
We'll go see
Dr. Hartman.

342
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,992
I don't want to do that;
I'm embarrassed.

343
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,693
This shouldn't
embarrass you.

344
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,996
The size should
embarrass you.

345
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,003
How about now? Is this
doing anything for you?

346
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,037
No.

347
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,407
Hmm. Well, what if
I show you my tattoo?

348
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,277
Nothing.
Well, you got
a dead rat

349
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,378
in your
pants, mister.

350
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,013
There's got to be
something you can do,

351
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,047
Dr. Hartman.

352
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,682
Have you tried
getting a divorce?

353
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,851
I've never seen this
problem in a single man.

354
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,053
Doctor, what about
Viagra or Cialis?

355
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,054
What about them?

356
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,923
Well, if Peter
could try them,

357
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,424
they might help
with his problem.

358
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,859
Those are for man troubles?

359
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,194
I've been prescribing them
as antidepressants.

360
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:35,033
Everything's just getting
harder and harder.

361
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,038
Hey, you guys
want another round?

362
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,873
Oh, I don't know, Peter,
it's getting kind of late.

363
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,141
Yeah, I got
to get going.

364
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,209
It takes me three hours
to get ready for bed.

365
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,945
Oh, please don't
make me go home

366
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:47,979
and disappoint
my wife yet again!

367
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,380
What are you
talking about, Peter?

368
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,816
You know how earlier tonight
we all said we had erections?

369
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:52,817
I lied.

370
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,085
So did I.

371
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,154
Dr. Hartman says I'm impotent.

372
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,922
Oh, you don't have to
take that from him.

373
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,958
You know, Dr. Hartman
once told me I had gonorrhea.

374
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,093
So I hit him
in the head with a bat.

375
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:05,263
I <i>give</i> gonorrhea,
I don't <i>get</i> gonorrhea. Okay?

376
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:06,898
It's terrible, guys.

377
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
I tried the pills he gave me,
but even they didn't work.

378
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,134
Well, look at it
this way, Peter:

379
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,469
without sex, you'll
have more time

380
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,471
to do the things you've
always wanted to do.

381
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,573
For me, it was learning
to play the trombone.

382
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,642
Why the hell would you
want to play the trombone?

383
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,510
For moments
like this.

384
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,012
Peter can't
get an erection.

385
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,815
(plays descending note)

386
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,584
Peter, I am gonna help
you beat impotence.

387
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,986
We can do
this together.

388
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,687
Thanks, Quagmire,
'cause this sucks.

389
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:30,788
I think even the people

390
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,924
at the office supply store
can tell.

391
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,659
Um, excuse me,
where do you keep

392
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,994
your three-ring binders?

393
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:36,995
Those are on aisle...

394
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,696
Hold on a sec.

395
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,601
We're all out
of binders.

396
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,538
All right, Peter, now, when
it comes to curing impotence,

397
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,107
sometimes you
have to get creative.

398
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,609
So, we're gonna try
the Boston Method.
What's that?

399
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,178
Well, basically, some dirtbag
from Boston yells at your junk

400
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,014
to scare it
into working again.

401
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,616
So you got a
stupid penis, huh?

402
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,318
I-I guess so.

403
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,187
You hear me in there,
dum-dum? Let's look alive.

404
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,823
Listen, I could be nice about
this or I could get my brother.

405
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,458
And he did some
serious time

406
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,294
for throwing a turkey
off a bridge into a car.

407
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,896
It's-it's not working.

408
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,231
All right,
well, I got to go.

409
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,901
There's a ripped screen door
that needs slamming.

410
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,037
How could a town
with so many great colleges

411
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,272
produce nothing but dopes?

412
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,746
You sure this is
gonna work, Quagmire?

413
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:29,914
Of course. This isn't
the first time

414
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,315
I've rigged up
a sex puppet.

415
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,751
I now have full control
over your genitals.

416
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:34,552
Are you sure?

417
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,920
Yeah, check it out.

418
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,655
(giggles)

419
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,991
It looks like
an unmanned fire hose.

420
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:40,925
Stop smiling,
this is serious.

421
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,560
You got to have
your sex face.

422
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,497
Okay, okay, my sex face
is a ton of underbite.

423
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,665
Okay.

424
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,400
Lois, I'm ready.

425
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,172
LOIS:
Oh, Peter.

426
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,176
PETER:
How about this?

427
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,113
Damn it, Peter,
I'll set the pace, you idiot.

428
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,915
All right, now to
let some line out.

429
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,249
Let her dance with it a little.

430
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,951
(wires whistling)

431
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,588
LOIS: Oh, come on, Peter,
get out of my water glass.

432
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,956
I need to take a pill later.

433
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,792
PETER: Oh, sorry, I guess I need
to be a little more to the left.

434
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,961
A little more
to the left!

435
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,297
Come on, Quagmire, you were
a Navy pilot for six years.

436
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,631
Land this thing.

437
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,042
LOIS:
Oh, Peter, that's new.

438
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,877
Let me try.

439
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,612
LOIS:
Eh, tired.

440
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,717
Nothing seems to be
working, you guys.

441
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,119
Is it gonna
be like this forever?

442
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,320
Yes.
No.

443
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,955
Yes.

444
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,591
Hold on, Peter. You didn't start
having trouble in the bedroom

445
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:47,992
until you lost
your job, right?

446
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:48,926
Yeah, so?

447
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,261
Well, that
explains it.

448
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,896
I mean, you've been
completely emasculated

449
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,464
because you're no longer
the breadwinner.

450
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,799
What are you
getting at, Quagmire?

451
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,967
There's only
one thing

452
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,135
that's gonna restore
your masculinity.

453
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,170
We got to get you
your old job back.

454
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,639
It was a mistake for me
to ever take that promotion.

455
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,940
Wait a minute.

456
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,276
It was a mistake
<i>giving</i> you a promotion.

457
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,111
(gasps) Quagmire.

458
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,213
I'm not following you.

459
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,851
So, by promoting
an incompetent man,

460
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:14,952
<i>you</i> were at fault.

461
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,921
Nice try,
but I'm not the one

462
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,489
who drove a forklift
into a conference room

463
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,124
and sent two people
to the hospital.

464
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,293
Come on, since
this man lost his job,

465
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,761
he can't pleasure
his wife.

466
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,096
Is that true?

467
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:28,299
I-I have what the kids call
"maje wien probs."

468
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,301
Angela, I really
need my job back.

469
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:33,037
And I could stand here
and give you a big speech

470
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,040
about second chances and promise
to work harder than ever before.

471
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,976
And I could remind you that
one day you might be in my shoes

472
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,878
and maybe you'll need
a second chance.

473
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,180
But I'm not gonna do that.

474
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,148
I'm gonna cash in
this coupon you gave me

475
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,349
last Valentine's Day.

"One Redo For Being Fired
For Gross Negligence."

477
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,755
"And One Hug."

478
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,592
The hug one is expired, Griffin.

479
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,029
This one's for free.

480
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,064
Welcome back, Griffin.

481
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,365
CROWD:
Aw.

482
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,567
Who's that?

483
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,903
Oh, I hired a studio audience
to do your old job.

484
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,004
You guys are fired.

485
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,207
CROWD:
Aw.

486
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,516
Peter, I can't
help you shake DVDs

487
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,850
out of the Redbox again.

488
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,385
I got in trouble last time.

489
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,987
Now, go away, I'm working.

490
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:26,891
You don't have to anymore,
because I got my old job back.

491
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,826
Peter, I'm so proud of you.

492
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:29,760
And you know what?

493
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,263
Something else is
working now, too.

494
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,364
Oh, my.

495
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,432
Let's go home.

496
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,767
No. I am gonna
do you right here

497
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,437
on a stack
of pita bread.

498
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,072
LOIS:
Oh, Peter.

499
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,342
PETER: Yeah, the bread's all
soft and doughy, isn't it?

500
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,043
And the inside of
the bag's always wet

501
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,412
because those hairy
dummies put it in too hot.

502
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,849
(both grunting)

503
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,951
This is a cool place.

504
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,087
