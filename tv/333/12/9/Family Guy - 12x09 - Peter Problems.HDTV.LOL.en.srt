12
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:36,363
Morning, Stella.

13
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:37,431
Morning, Peter.

14
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,200
Hey, listen, I-I got to
ask you something.

15
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:41,035
Last night, I heard,
uh, the song

16
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:42,703
"Pour Some Sugar On Me,"

17
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:44,905
and-and this question
popped into my head.

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,508
Are you-- and please say
yes-- are you related--

19
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:50,044
and even if you're not, please
say yes-- are you related to--

20
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:52,012
and please say yes
because I need the attention

21
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:54,915
from my friends-- are you
related to Def Leppard?

22
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,484
Griffin, can I talk
to you privately?

23
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:58,352
Stella, turn around.

24
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:01,288
You know, that is one nice thing
about having a deaf coworker.

25
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:03,858
Well, that and I can work
on my verbal sound effects

26
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:05,126
and not feel
self-conscious about

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,694
the ones that aren't
quite there yet.

28
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:08,429
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:11,165
I'm talking about this:
shabba dabba dabba dabba dabba.

30
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:12,900
That's a helicopter
hovering over a woman

31
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:14,135
swimming in her pool.

32
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:15,269
I also do animals.

33
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:16,470
Here's a mouse.

34
00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:18,372
Mouse?

35
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:19,974
Oh, that one's ready.

36
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,809
Griffin, I actually
came to tell you

37
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:24,311
that you're being promoted
to forklift operator.

38
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:25,746
Really? That's awesome!

39
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:27,715
Yeah, Frank retired, and
since you're already required

40
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:28,949
to wear a helmet here--

41
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:30,651
which, by the way,
put on your helmet.

42
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:31,819
Oh, sorry.

43
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:33,487
Anyway, the job is yours.

44
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:35,656
Which means you'll be
receiving a five percent raise.

45
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,191
Wow, a raise!

46
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:39,727
I guess this means I can
afford to set up this cutaway

47
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:41,829
with a fancy
new transition.

All right, you beautiful
bastard, show me what you got.

51
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,191
Peter, you can run now,

52
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,026
and no one will
call you a quitter.

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,460
What am I saying? No.

54
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:16,530
I learned how to use stickers,
and I can learn how to use this.

55
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:38,853
Oh, this is awesome.

56
00:02:57,706 --> 00:02:59,039
Oh, guys, good,
you're here.

57
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:01,508
I am so excited.
Guess what.

58
00:03:01,543 --> 00:03:03,277
I hope this isn't
about your podcast again.

59
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,745
Why? Did you
finally listen to it?

60
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:06,614
Yeah, it was just
15 minutes of you listing

61
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:08,415
all the hats
you could think of.

62
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,251
Sherlock Holmes hat.

63
00:03:10,285 --> 00:03:11,719
Football man hat.

64
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:14,321
Angry working-class
Irish idiot hat.

65
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:17,625
Underwear 'cause you're a cat
in the laundry basket hat.

66
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:20,327
Vietnamese the sun
is my enemy hat.

67
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:24,164
Halloween mask that
I flip up to eat my candy hat.

68
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,001
College guy wearing
a pizza box hat.

69
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:28,569
Blue hat.

70
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:30,671
I think that's all the hats.

71
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:32,106
No, you guys, this
is really big.

72
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,207
You're not gonna
believe this.

73
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:34,341
Peter, we've
been over this.

74
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:35,609
You're not
allowed to say that

75
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:37,111
unless there's
a forklift outside.

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,080
Forklift!

77
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:42,283
Wow!

78
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:43,484
I know,
awesome, right?

79
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:45,185
Oh, my God,
I want to get on!

80
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,855
Hold on, remember the first
thing we said we'd do.

81
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:51,592
Wow.

82
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:53,627
So that's what the
tops of cars look like.

83
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:55,162
All right,
walking speed.

84
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:58,465
Afternoon, ma'am.

85
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,100
Afternoon to you,
normal sir.

86
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:01,769
No one can tell.

87
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:05,806
Uh, how's the weather
down there, you short idiot?

88
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,541
Should we tell him
his pants fell off?

89
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:08,976
No, let's wait awhile.

90
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,679
♪ Well you can tell by
the way I use my walk ♪

91
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:14,882
♪ I walk all the time,

92
00:04:29,998 --> 00:04:32,533
Uh, are you gonna
stay for the bris?

93
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:34,401
Nah, I don't
want to see that.

94
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:38,839
This whale's
beached himself.

95
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:41,342
He needs to get back
in the water or he'll die.

96
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,843
Step aside,
I'll handle this.

97
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:44,311
Give me some room.

98
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:58,185
You're whale-come.

99
00:05:58,219 --> 00:05:59,553
Aw, cool shell.

100
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:16,003
Ah, this is what it's
all about, huh, Duke?

101
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:19,073
600 gallons of beer
in one big thing.

102
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:21,008
This is what
we do, Peter.

103
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,876
You know, I always thought
I could chug that,

104
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,145
but I never tried 'cause
I figured I couldn't lift it.

105
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,613
Until now.

106
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:28,749
Are you nuts?
No way you can chug that.

107
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:30,117
No, I can totally do it.

108
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:32,152
I've only had, like,
four beers this morning.

109
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:52,172
He's doing it!

110
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:54,308
It's killing him,
but he's doing it.

111
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:05,752
So, as you can see,
sales are going very well.

112
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:11,358
Griffin, you're fired!

113
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:14,094
Eh, see if I care.

114
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:15,596
Hello, COBRA?

115
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,600
I'd like to pay $1,300 for
one month of health insurance.

116
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:27,393
How's the job
search going, Dad?

117
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:28,427
Eh, not great, Chris.

118
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:29,895
I'm looking
at the paper right now.

119
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,197
I don't see a lot here.

120
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:33,566
Hey, Lois, how much
you think a Sagittarius pays?

121
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,668
I think you're in
the wrong section, Peter.

122
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:37,169
Oh, pardon me.

123
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:39,305
Oh, looks like
the Dodgers just cut Peña.

124
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:40,339
Might be something there.

125
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,941
Peter, put
the paper down.

126
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,309
Okay, kids,
off to school.

127
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:44,677
Now, I know
it's picture day,

128
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:46,078
but we can't
afford them anymore,

129
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:47,513
so just run
behind another kid

130
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,548
when they're getting
their picture taken.

131
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:56,088
Peter, we should talk
about this job situation.

132
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:57,490
Our savings are
getting pretty low.

133
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:58,557
You know,
actually, Peter,

134
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:00,025
there's a lot
of job training programs

135
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,093
sponsored by the state

136
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:02,995
that could help you
get the skills you need

137
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:04,029
for another occupation.

138
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:05,698
You know, Brian,
you could get a job.

139
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:06,899
I have a job.

140
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,068
I-I'm a writer, Peter.
I'm working right now.

141
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:10,202
See this,
all of this?

142
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,505
This is the raw material
of a picture of life

143
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,273
that I'm gonna
paint with words.

144
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:16,108
Yesterday, it took you
30 minutes

145
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:17,977
to lap up a cold cut
off the floor.

146
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:19,745
That's my process!

147
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,913
It's been three weeks

148
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:22,615
and you haven't had
a single job lead.

149
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:23,749
Oh, that's not true.

150
00:08:23,784 --> 00:08:26,218
I came really close
with that job at the school.

151
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:27,920
So, what makes you want
to be a crossing guard?

152
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:29,622
I don't know, I just
thought it would be cool

153
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:32,992
to decide which kids do
and don't get hit by a car.

154
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,594
Well, Peter, since you've been
having such a tough time,

155
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:38,597
I was thinking, maybe I
should look for a job.

156
00:08:38,632 --> 00:08:41,534
Lois, I'll be damned if I will
let my wife be a prostitute.

157
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:44,103
What? No, I'll get
a regular job.

158
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:46,071
What,
like a lawyer?

159
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:49,308
Peter, there are jobs for women
between prostitute and lawyer.

160
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,342
Wartime nurse?

161
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:51,377
We need money.

162
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:52,912
I'm gonna look
for a job.

163
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:55,481
I guess you should;
and that'll give me more time

164
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,983
to focus on expanding
my record collection.

165
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:59,919
How's this one?
Oh, Bach.

166
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,487
Is very good.
I recommend.

167
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,688
And this one?

168
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:04,123
Oh, Mozart.

169
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:05,357
The boy genius.

170
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:06,392
The best.

171
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:07,593
Okay, how about this?

172
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,094
Ooh, Debussy.

173
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,463
I love Debussy.

174
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:13,232
Sometimes all I can
think about is Debussy.

175
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:14,967
Oh, look at the pianist.

176
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,169
The pianist is so good
with Debussy.

177
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:18,571
So, you like
his early work?

178
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,539
Oh, yes,
when Debussy was young,

179
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:22,208
that's when
you want Debussy.

180
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:23,642
Okay, I'll
take these two.

181
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:24,743
Very good, sir.

182
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:27,179
Just make sure
you finish on the Bach.

183
00:09:27,214 --> 00:09:29,048
Never finish on Debussy.

184
00:09:30,484 --> 00:09:32,485
Bravo! Bravo!

185
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:39,758
All right,
you can do this.

186
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:41,026
You've shopped here for years.

187
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:43,329
You know this place
like the back of your hand.

188
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:48,033
Now, Mrs. Griffin, where
did you go to college?

189
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,101
Groceries.

190
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,103
Are you available
to work weekends?

191
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:52,338
Groceries.

192
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:53,372
Very impressive.

193
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:54,940
This next one is
a trick question.

194
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:56,141
Groceries?

195
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:57,343
I'm hired.

196
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:59,011
Welcome aboard.

197
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,184
Hey, guys,
great news.

198
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:07,253
You're looking at
the new assistant store manager

199
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:08,320
of Stop 'N Shop.

200
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:09,989
You got a job
at the grocery store?

201
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:11,357
That's great!

202
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:13,626
You get to see all the food
before it's famous.

203
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,894
Well, you know
you've made it

204
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:16,529
when you've got
a teenage boss.

205
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:17,596
Lois, that's awesome!

206
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:19,465
Now I can spend
my days at The Clam

207
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:20,866
like we've always
talked about.

208
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:23,202
No, Peter, if I'm gonna
be out of the house working,

209
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,604
you're gonna have to take over
for me in the house.

210
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,673
Wait, wait, what,
I-I got to do what you do?

211
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:29,775
Spending the whole day
taking Tylenol PMs

212
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,377
and straddling
the bath faucet?

213
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:33,846
Well, the guy knows what's going
on here, I'll give him that.

214
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,715
No, I mean, you're gonna need to
cook the meals and do laundry

215
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,617
and take care of Stewie,
like I've been doing.

216
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:39,618
Are you serious?

217
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:40,753
Dad's gonna
run the house?

218
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:41,954
Hey, I can do it.

219
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:44,089
I mean, it can't be
any harder than that job

220
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:45,958
I used to have
at the bowling alley.

221
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:46,959
Bowlarama.

222
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:48,460
Yes, we're open.

223
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:50,863
Oh, yes, we have a wide
selection of balls

224
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:53,499
that are way too heavy
or have too-small finger holes.

225
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,701
Uh, no, you will not
be able to do anything

226
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,970
with your wrist
for seven days afterward.

227
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:00,372
Yes, sir, all of the joysticks
in the arcade

228
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:03,008
are completely covered in pizza
grease, no worries there.

229
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:04,276
What's that?

230
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:06,912
Oh, absolutely, there is always
a group of teenagers

231
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:09,381
throwing the ball real hard
and scaring everyone.

232
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,585
No, there is no smoking,
but we do let you smoke.

233
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:14,987
Yes, it's all terrible,
come on down.

234
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:21,961
Why are you doing laundry
in the dishwasher?

235
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,495
Oh, I can't use
the washing machine;

236
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,097
it's really been
acting up lately.

237
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:27,566
What the hell?

238
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,635
What's going on
down here?

239
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:31,203
This is washing
machine stuff.

240
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:33,072
Go back upstairs,
suck-bag.

241
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,178
All right, Stewie, I'm gonna
change your diaper now.

242
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:41,914
Which, unfortunately, means
I have to touch your privates.

243
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:44,283
All right, so here I
come with the cloth.

244
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,352
Okay? This is
not sexual.

245
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:49,488
All right, I've made contact
with your undercarriage.

246
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:51,757
I am moving it upwards
with a cupped hand.

247
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,359
I'm looking you
in the eye now.

248
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,793
Please meet my gaze.

249
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:56,028
And we're done.

250
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:58,797
That was intense.

251
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,768
All right, kids,
you are really gonna love

252
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:04,536
these Cornish game hens
I cooked for dinner.

253
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:06,739
Now, I don't want
to pat myself on the back,

254
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:09,041
but I worked all day
getting 'em just right...

255
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,342
Holy crap!

256
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:12,044
Oh, my God.

257
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:13,345
Then that means...

258
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,181
And that also means...

259
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:20,686
You know what, Peter?

260
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,489
You tried hard, and you
still earned that wine.

261
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:30,529
I'm home.

262
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:32,564
Wow, Peter,
the house looks amazing.

263
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,133
Yeah, well, let's
take off our shoes

264
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,901
and try to keep
it that way, huh?

265
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:38,170
No, really, Peter,
it seems like you've really

266
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:39,805
taken to being
a househusband.

267
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,306
Well, it hasn't
been easy.

268
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:42,675
Between doing the
laundry and vacuuming,

269
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,910
I barely had time to
put on a nice sweater

270
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:47,379
and clasp a cup of
tea with two hands.

271
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,651
Ah.

272
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:56,922
And now to tie this sweater
around my waist

273
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:59,124
and walk around
the neighborhood.

274
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,226
Well, what do you say
I reward you

275
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:02,594
for all your hard work?

276
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:04,363
Geez, Lois, is that
all you think about?

277
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:05,431
I'm tired.

278
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:06,465
Come on, Peter.

279
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:07,466
I need this release.

280
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,934
I had a long
day at work.

281
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:10,402
Oh, work.

282
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:12,037
I suppose work
is why you missed

283
00:13:12,072 --> 00:13:13,505
Chris's father-son picnic.

284
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,574
Peter, you're still
Chris's father.

285
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:16,909
Why can't you just listen

286
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,777
instead of trying
to fix everything?!

287
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,313
Get in here, Peter.

288
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:22,748
Don't you want to have sex?

289
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:25,417
I don't think we've done it
since I started working.

290
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:26,885
Yeah, I guess you're right.

291
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,355
Come on, where's my big,
strong man?

292
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,292
Putting on one of your
dress shirts to look sexy.

293
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:38,030
Mmm.

294
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:40,132
I want to do it on top
of the comforter.

295
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,734
I don't care if
we make streaks.

296
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:42,935
Well, of course <i>you</i> don't,

297
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,436
you're not the one
who cleans it.

298
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,905
Peter, just shut
up and take me!

299
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:52,678
Peter, get up! Get up!

300
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:54,179
There's a caterpillar
in the bed!

301
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:56,248
Oh, that's, uh...
that's me.

302
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:57,282
What?

303
00:13:57,317 --> 00:13:58,917
How do I put this
delicately?

304
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:02,254
My hog cannot partake
in the slop this evening.

305
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:05,758
Peter, are you having
trouble getting... ready?

306
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,493
Yes, obviously,
I'm having trouble!

307
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:09,461
Well, somebody's gonna
have sex with me.

308
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:10,529
Lois, don't say that.

309
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:12,765
Quagmire will show up
like the Road Runner.

310
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:18,904
It's okay, your vagina's
just a painted-on hole.

311
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,616
Oh, Peter,
you're up.

312
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,917
That's not
what I heard.

313
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,287
Hey, Peter, you want
a little something

314
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:32,455
to put in that
orange juice?

315
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,690
What? Why? It's 9:00 a.m.

316
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:34,924
Well, I
figured you'd

317
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,659
like to start your day
with a stiff one.

318
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:39,629
You can't
get a boner!

319
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:42,198
You're a failure as
a man and a father.

320
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,367
Peter, it's nothing
to get upset about.

321
00:14:44,402 --> 00:14:46,002
There's treatments
available.

322
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:47,504
We'll go see
Dr. Hartman.

323
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,339
I don't want to do that;
I'm embarrassed.

324
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:51,107
This shouldn't
embarrass you.

325
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:53,343
The size should
embarrass you.

326
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:00,283
How about now? Is this
doing anything for you?

327
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,518
No.

328
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:04,788
Hmm. Well, what if
I show you my tattoo?

329
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:07,724
Nothing.
Well, you got a dead rat

330
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:08,792
in your
pants, mister.

331
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,493
There's got to be
something you can do,

332
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:11,528
Dr. Hartman.

333
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,029
Have you tried
getting a divorce?

334
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:15,165
I've never seen this
problem in a single man.

335
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,333
Doctor, what about
Viagra or Cialis?

336
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:18,535
What about them?

337
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:20,236
Well, if Peter
could try them,

338
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:21,838
they might help
with his problem.

339
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:23,173
Those are for man troubles?

340
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:25,642
I've been prescribing them
as antidepressants.

341
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:30,313
Everything's just getting
harder and harder.

342
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:35,685
Hey, you guys
want another round?

343
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,554
Oh, I don't know, Peter,
it's getting kind of late.

344
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:38,788
Yeah, I got
to get going.

345
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,824
It takes me three hours
to get ready for bed.

346
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,425
Oh, please don't
make me go home

347
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,660
and disappoint
my wife yet again!

348
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,015
What are you
talking about, Peter?

349
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,564
You know how earlier tonight
we all said we had erections?

350
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:48,565
I lied.

351
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,766
So did I.

352
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,835
Dr. Hartman says I'm impotent.

353
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,636
Oh, you don't have to
take that from him.

354
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:55,672
You know, Dr. Hartman
once told me I had gonorrhea.

355
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,707
So I hit him
in the head with a bat.

356
00:15:57,741 --> 00:16:00,844
I <i>give</i> gonorrhea,
I don't <i>get</i> gonorrhea. Okay?

357
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,345
It's terrible, guys.

358
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,347
I tried the pills he gave me,
but even they didn't work.

359
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:05,748
Well, look at it
this way, Peter:

360
00:16:05,783 --> 00:16:07,016
without sex, you'll
have more time

361
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:09,018
to do the things you've
always wanted to do.

362
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:11,087
For me, it was learning
to play the trombone.

363
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,156
Why the hell would you
want to play the trombone?

364
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,058
For moments
like this.

365
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:16,659
Peter can't
get an erection.

366
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,098
Peter, I am gonna help
you beat impotence.

367
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:23,433
We can do
this together.

368
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:25,201
Thanks, Quagmire,
'cause this sucks.

369
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:26,469
I think even the people

370
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:28,571
at the office supply store
can tell.

371
00:16:28,606 --> 00:16:30,173
Um, excuse me,
where do you keep

372
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,441
your three-ring binders?

373
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:32,642
Those are on aisle...

374
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:34,177
Hold on a sec.

375
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,115
We're all out
of binders.

376
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:43,152
All right, Peter, now, when
it comes to curing impotence,

377
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:44,721
sometimes you
have to get creative.

378
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,712
So, we're gonna try
the Boston Method.

379
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:47,156
What's that?

380
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:49,792
Well, basically, some dirtbag
from Boston yells at your junk

381
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:51,427
to scare it
into working again.

382
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:54,130
So you got a
stupid penis, huh?

383
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:55,899
I-I guess so.

384
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,735
You hear me in there,
dum-dum? Let's look alive.

385
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,437
Listen, I could be nice about
this or I could get my brother.

386
00:17:01,472 --> 00:17:02,939
And he did some
serious time

387
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:05,808
for throwing a turkey
off a bridge into a car.

388
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:07,310
It's-it's not working.

389
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:08,778
All right,
well, I got to go.

390
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:12,315
There's a ripped screen door
that needs slamming.

391
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,617
How could a town
with so many great colleges

392
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:16,786
produce nothing but dopes?

393
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:24,193
You sure this is
gonna work, Quagmire?

394
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:25,528
Of course. This isn't
the first time

395
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:26,829
I've rigged up
a sex puppet.

396
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:29,198
I now have full control
over your genitals.

397
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,033
Are you sure?

398
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,534
Yeah, check it out.

399
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,371
It looks like
an unmanned fire hose.

400
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:36,566
Stop smiling,
this is serious.

401
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:38,041
You got to have
your sex face.

402
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:41,978
Okay, okay, my sex face
is a ton of underbite.

403
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:43,112
Okay.

404
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:44,881
Lois, I'm ready.

405
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:49,719
Oh, Peter.

406
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:53,723
How about this?

407
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:57,627
Damn it, Peter,
I'll set the pace, you idiot.

408
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,262
All right, now to
let some line out.

409
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,730
Let her dance with it a little.

410
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:06,102
Oh, come on, Peter,
get out of my water glass.

411
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:07,503
I need to take a pill later.

412
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:10,173
Oh, sorry, I guess I need
to be a little more to the left.

413
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:12,308
A little more
to the left!

414
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:14,777
Come on, Quagmire, you were
a Navy pilot for six years.

415
00:18:14,812 --> 00:18:16,012
Land this thing.

416
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,356
Oh, Peter, that's new.

417
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,224
Let me try.

418
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:29,993
Eh, tired.

419
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:35,098
Nothing seems to be
working, you guys.

420
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:36,633
Is it gonna
be like this forever?

421
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:37,800
Yes.
No.

422
00:18:37,835 --> 00:18:39,502
Yes.

423
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,005
Hold on, Peter. You didn't start
having trouble in the bedroom

424
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,339
until you lost
your job, right?

425
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:44,474
Yeah, so?

426
00:18:44,508 --> 00:18:45,742
Well, that
explains it.

427
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,243
I mean, you've been
completely emasculated

428
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:48,911
because you're no longer
the breadwinner.

429
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:50,179
What are you
getting at, Quagmire?

430
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,314
There's only
one thing

431
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:52,649
that's gonna restore
your masculinity.

432
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:54,684
We got to get you
your old job back.

433
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,053
It was a mistake for me
to ever take that promotion.

434
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:58,221
Wait a minute.

435
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:00,690
It was a mistake
<i>giving</i> you a promotion.

436
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,558
Quagmire.

437
00:19:02,593 --> 00:19:04,427
I'm not following you.

438
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:09,165
So, by promoting
an incompetent man,

439
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,433
<i>you</i> were at fault.

440
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,201
Nice try,
but I'm not the one

441
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,870
who drove a forklift
into a conference room

442
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,571
and sent two people
to the hospital.

443
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:17,707
Come on, since
this man lost his job,

444
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,075
he can't pleasure
his wife.

445
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:20,543
Is that true?

446
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,713
I-I have what the kids call
"maje wien probs."

447
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,715
Angela, I really
need my job back.

448
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,317
And I could stand here
and give you a big speech

449
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:31,521
about second chances and promise
to work harder than ever before.

450
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:34,457
And I could remind you that
one day you might be in my shoes

451
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:36,192
and maybe you'll need
a second chance.

452
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,427
But I'm not gonna do that.

453
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:39,395
I'm gonna cash in
this coupon you gave me

454
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,763
last Valentine's Day.

455
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,000
"One Redo For Being Fired
For Gross Negligence."

456
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:46,069
"And One Hug."

457
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:49,939
The hug one is expired, Griffin.

458
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:53,509
This one's for free.

459
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:55,578
Welcome back, Griffin.

460
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:56,813
Aw.

461
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:57,980
Who's that?

462
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:01,250
Oh, I hired a studio audience
to do your old job.

463
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,518
You guys are fired.

464
00:20:02,553 --> 00:20:04,654
Aw.

465
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:14,130
Peter, I can't
help you shake DVDs

466
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:15,398
out of the Redbox again.

467
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:17,033
I got in trouble last time.

468
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,701
Now, go away, I'm working.

469
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:22,438
You don't have to anymore,
because I got my old job back.

470
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:24,474
Peter, I'm so proud of you.

471
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:25,541
And you know what?

472
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,219
Something else is
working now, too.

473
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:29,286
Oh, my.

474
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:30,354
Let's go home.

475
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:32,623
No. I am gonna
do you right here

476
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:35,359
on a stack
of pita bread.

477
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:37,061
Oh, Peter.

478
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:40,264
Yeah, the bread's all
soft and doughy, isn't it?

479
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:42,033
And the inside of
the bag's always wet

480
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,335
because those hairy
dummies put it in too hot.

481
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,247
This is a cool place.
