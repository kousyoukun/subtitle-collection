12
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:36,364
Morning, Stella.

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,432
Morning, Peter.

14
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:39,201
Hey, listen, I-I got to
ask you something.

15
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:41,036
Last night, I heard,
uh, the song

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,704
"Pour Some Sugar On Me,"

17
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:44,906
and-and this question
popped into my head.

18
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:47,509
Are you-- and please say
yes-- are you related--

19
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:50,045
and even if you're not, please
say yes-- are you related to--

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,013
and please say yes
because I need the attention

21
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:54,916
from my friends-- are you
related to Def Leppard?

22
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:56,485
Griffin, can I talk
to you privately?

23
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:58,353
Stella, turn around.

24
00:00:58,387 --> 00:01:01,289
You know, that is one nice thing
about having a deaf coworker.

25
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:03,859
Well, that and I can work
on my verbal sound effects

26
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:05,127
and not feel
self-conscious about

27
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:06,695
the ones that aren't
quite there yet.

28
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,430
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:11,166
I'm talking about this:
shabba dabba dabba dabba dabba.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,901
That's a helicopter
hovering over a woman

31
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:14,136
swimming in her pool.

32
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,270
I also do animals.

33
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:16,471
Here's a mouse.

34
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:18,373
Mouse?

35
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:19,975
Oh, that one's ready.

36
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,810
Griffin, I actually
came to tell you

37
00:01:21,844 --> 00:01:24,312
that you're being promoted
to forklift operator.

38
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:25,747
Really? That's awesome!

39
00:01:25,782 --> 00:01:27,716
Yeah, Frank retired, and
since you're already required

40
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,950
to wear a helmet here--

41
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:30,652
which, by the way,
put on your helmet.

42
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:31,820
Oh, sorry.

43
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:33,488
Anyway, the job is yours.

44
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:35,657
Which means you'll be
receiving a five percent raise.

45
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:37,192
Wow, a raise!

46
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:39,728
I guess this means I can
afford to set up this cutaway

47
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:41,830
with a fancy
new transition.

All right, you beautiful
bastard, show me what you got.

51
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,192
Peter, you can run now,

52
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:12,027
and no one will
call you a quitter.

53
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:13,461
What am I saying? No.

54
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:16,531
I learned how to use stickers,
and I can learn how to use this.

55
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:38,854
Oh, this is awesome.

56
00:02:57,707 --> 00:02:59,040
Oh, guys, good,
you're here.

57
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:01,509
I am so excited.
Guess what.

58
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:03,278
I hope this isn't
about your podcast again.

59
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:04,746
Why? Did you
finally listen to it?

60
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,615
Yeah, it was just
15 minutes of you listing

61
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:08,416
all the hats
you could think of.

62
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,252
Sherlock Holmes hat.

63
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:11,720
Football man hat.

64
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,322
Angry working-class
Irish idiot hat.

65
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:17,626
Underwear 'cause you're a cat
in the laundry basket hat.

66
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,328
Vietnamese the sun
is my enemy hat.

67
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:24,165
Halloween mask that
I flip up to eat my candy hat.

68
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,002
College guy wearing
a pizza box hat.

69
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,570
Blue hat.

70
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:30,672
I think that's all the hats.

71
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:32,107
No, you guys, this
is really big.

72
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,208
You're not gonna
believe this.

73
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:34,342
Peter, we've
been over this.

74
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:35,610
You're not
allowed to say that

75
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:37,112
unless there's
a forklift outside.

76
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,081
Forklift!

77
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:42,284
Wow!

78
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:43,485
I know,
awesome, right?

79
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,186
Oh, my God,
I want to get on!

80
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,856
Hold on, remember the first
thing we said we'd do.

81
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:51,593
Wow.

82
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:53,628
So that's what the
tops of cars look like.

83
00:03:53,663 --> 00:03:55,163
All right,
walking speed.

84
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,466
Afternoon, ma'am.

85
00:03:58,501 --> 00:04:00,101
Afternoon to you,
normal sir.

86
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,770
No one can tell.

87
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,807
Uh, how's the weather
down there, you short idiot?

88
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:07,542
Should we tell him
his pants fell off?

89
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:08,977
No, let's wait awhile.

90

♪ Well you can tell by
the way I use my walk ♪

91
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:14,883
♪ I walk all the time,

92
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:32,534
Uh, are you gonna
stay for the bris?

93
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:34,402
Nah, I don't
want to see that.

94
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,840
This whale's
beached himself.

95
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:41,343
He needs to get back
in the water or he'll die.

96
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:42,844
Step aside,
I'll handle this.

97
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:44,312
Give me some room.

98
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:58,186
You're whale-come.

99
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,554
Aw, cool shell.

100
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:16,004
Ah, this is what it's
all about, huh, Duke?

101
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:19,074
600 gallons of beer
in one big thing.

102
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:21,009
This is what
we do, Peter.

103
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,877
You know, I always thought
I could chug that,

104
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:25,146
but I never tried 'cause
I figured I couldn't lift it.

105
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,614
Until now.

106
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,750
Are you nuts?
No way you can chug that.

107
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:30,118
No, I can totally do it.

108
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:32,153
I've only had, like,
four beers this morning.

109
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:52,173
He's doing it!

110
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,309
It's killing him,
but he's doing it.

111
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:05,753
So, as you can see,
sales are going very well.

112
00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:11,359
Griffin, you're fired!

113
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:14,095
Eh, see if I care.

114
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,597
Hello, COBRA?

115
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:19,601
I'd like to pay $1,300 for
one month of health insurance.

116
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:27,394
How's the job
search going, Dad?

117
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:28,428
Eh, not great, Chris.

118
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:29,896
I'm looking
at the paper right now.

119
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,198
I don't see a lot here.

120
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:33,567
Hey, Lois, how much
you think a Sagittarius pays?

121
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:35,669
I think you're in
the wrong section, Peter.

122
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:37,170
Oh, pardon me.

123
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,306
Oh, looks like
the Dodgers just cut Peña.

124
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Might be something there.

125
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:41,942
Peter, put
the paper down.

126
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,310
Okay, kids,
off to school.

127
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:44,678
Now, I know
it's picture day,

128
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,079
but we can't
afford them anymore,

129
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:47,514
so just run
behind another kid

130
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:49,549
when they're getting
their picture taken.

131
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:56,089
Peter, we should talk
about this job situation.

132
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,491
Our savings are
getting pretty low.

133
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:58,558
You know,
actually, Peter,

134
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,026
there's a lot
of job training programs

135
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:01,094
sponsored by the state

136
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:02,996
that could help you
get the skills you need

137
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,030
for another occupation.

138
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,699
You know, Brian,
you could get a job.

139
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:06,900
I have a job.

140
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:09,069
I-I'm a writer, Peter.
I'm working right now.

141
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:10,203
See this,
all of this?

142
00:08:10,238 --> 00:08:12,506
This is the raw material
of a picture of life

143
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,274
that I'm gonna
paint with words.

144
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:16,109
Yesterday, it took you
30 minutes

145
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:17,978
to lap up a cold cut
off the floor.

146
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:19,746
That's my process!

147
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:20,914
It's been three weeks

148
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:22,616
and you haven't had
a single job lead.

149
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,750
Oh, that's not true.

150
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:26,219
I came really close
with that job at the school.

151
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:27,921
So, what makes you want
to be a crossing guard?

152
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,623
I don't know, I just
thought it would be cool

153
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:32,993
to decide which kids do
and don't get hit by a car.

154
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:35,595
Well, Peter, since you've been
having such a tough time,

155
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,598
I was thinking, maybe I
should look for a job.

156
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:41,535
Lois, I'll be damned if I will
let my wife be a prostitute.

157
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:44,104
What? No, I'll get
a regular job.

158
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:46,072
What,
like a lawyer?

159
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:49,309
Peter, there are jobs for women
between prostitute and lawyer.

160
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:50,343
Wartime nurse?

161
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:51,378
We need money.

162
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:52,913
I'm gonna look
for a job.

163
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:55,482
I guess you should;
and that'll give me more time

164
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:57,984
to focus on expanding
my record collection.

165
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,920
How's this one?
Oh, Bach.

166
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,488
Is very good.
I recommend.

167
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:02,689
And this one?

168
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,124
Oh, Mozart.

169
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:05,358
The boy genius.

170
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:06,393
The best.

171
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:07,594
Okay, how about this?

172
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:09,095
Ooh, Debussy.

173
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,464
I love Debussy.

174
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:13,233
Sometimes all I can
think about is Debussy.

175
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:14,968
Oh, look at the pianist.

176
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,170
The pianist is so good
with Debussy.

177
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:18,572
So, you like
his early work?

178
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:20,540
Oh, yes,
when Debussy was young,

179
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:22,209
that's when
you want Debussy.

180
00:09:22,243 --> 00:09:23,643
Okay, I'll
take these two.

181
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:24,744
Very good, sir.

182
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,180
Just make sure
you finish on the Bach.

183
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:29,049
Never finish on Debussy.

184
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:32,486
Bravo! Bravo!

185
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:39,759
All right,
you can do this.

186
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:41,027
You've shopped here for years.

187
00:09:41,062 --> 00:09:43,330
You know this place
like the back of your hand.

188
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,034
Now, Mrs. Griffin, where
did you go to college?

189
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:49,102
Groceries.

190
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:51,104
Are you available
to work weekends?

191
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:52,339
Groceries.

192
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:53,373
Very impressive.

193
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,941
This next one is
a trick question.

194
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:56,142
Groceries?

195
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,344
I'm hired.

196
00:09:57,378 --> 00:09:59,012
Welcome aboard.

197
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,185
Hey, guys,
great news.

198
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:07,254
You're looking at
the new assistant store manager

199
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:08,321
of Stop 'N Shop.

200
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:09,990
You got a job
at the grocery store?

201
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:11,358
That's great!

202
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,627
You get to see all the food
before it's famous.

203
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:14,895
Well, you know
you've made it

204
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:16,530
when you've got
a teenage boss.

205
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:17,597
Lois, that's awesome!

206
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:19,466
Now I can spend
my days at The Clam

207
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,867
like we've always
talked about.

208
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:23,203
No, Peter, if I'm gonna
be out of the house working,

209
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:25,605
you're gonna have to take over
for me in the house.

210
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,674
Wait, wait, what,
I-I got to do what you do?

211
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,776
Spending the whole day
taking Tylenol PMs

212
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,378
and straddling
the bath faucet?

213
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:33,847
Well, the guy knows what's going
on here, I'll give him that.

214
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:36,716
No, I mean, you're gonna need to
cook the meals and do laundry

215
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,618
and take care of Stewie,
like I've been doing.

216
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:39,619
Are you serious?

217
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:40,754
Dad's gonna
run the house?

218
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:41,955
Hey, I can do it.

219
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:44,090
I mean, it can't be
any harder than that job

220
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,959
I used to have
at the bowling alley.

221
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:46,960
Bowlarama.

222
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:48,461
Yes, we're open.

223
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:50,864
Oh, yes, we have a wide
selection of balls

224
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:53,500
that are way too heavy
or have too-small finger holes.

225
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:55,702
Uh, no, you will not
be able to do anything

226
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:57,971
with your wrist
for seven days afterward.

227
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:00,373
Yes, sir, all of the joysticks
in the arcade

228
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:03,009
are completely covered in pizza
grease, no worries there.

229
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:04,277
What's that?

230
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:06,913
Oh, absolutely, there is always
a group of teenagers

231
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:09,382
throwing the ball real hard
and scaring everyone.

232
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:12,586
No, there is no smoking,
but we do let you smoke.

233
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,988
Yes, it's all terrible,
come on down.

234
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:21,962
Why are you doing laundry
in the dishwasher?

235
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:23,496
Oh, I can't use
the washing machine;

236
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:25,098
it's really been
acting up lately.

237
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,567
What the hell?

238
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:29,636
What's going on
down here?

239
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,204
This is washing
machine stuff.

240
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:33,073
Go back upstairs,
suck-bag.

241
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:39,179
All right, Stewie, I'm gonna
change your diaper now.

242
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:41,915
Which, unfortunately, means
I have to touch your privates.

243
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:44,284
All right, so here I
come with the cloth.

244
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:46,353
Okay? This is
not sexual.

245
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:49,489
All right, I've made contact
with your undercarriage.

246
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:51,758
I am moving it upwards
with a cupped hand.

247
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,360
I'm looking you
in the eye now.

248
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:54,794
Please meet my gaze.

249
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:56,029
And we're done.

250
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:58,798
That was intense.

251
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:02,769
All right, kids,
you are really gonna love

252
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:04,537
these Cornish game hens
I cooked for dinner.

253
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:06,740
Now, I don't want
to pat myself on the back,

254
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:09,042
but I worked all day
getting 'em just right...

255
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,343
Holy crap!

256
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:12,045
Oh, my God.

257
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,346
Then that means...

258
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:16,182
And that also means...

259
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:20,687
You know what, Peter?

260
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:23,490
You tried hard, and you
still earned that wine.

261
00:12:28,763 --> 00:12:30,530
I'm home.

262
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:32,565
Wow, Peter,
the house looks amazing.

263
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,134
Yeah, well, let's
take off our shoes

264
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:35,902
and try to keep
it that way, huh?

265
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:38,171
No, really, Peter,
it seems like you've really

266
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:39,806
taken to being
a househusband.

267
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,307
Well, it hasn't
been easy.

268
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:42,676
Between doing the
laundry and vacuuming,

269
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,911
I barely had time to
put on a nice sweater

270
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:47,380
and clasp a cup of
tea with two hands.

271
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,652
Ah.

272
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:56,923
And now to tie this sweater
around my waist

273
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:59,125
and walk around
the neighborhood.

274
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,227
Well, what do you say
I reward you

275
00:13:01,262 --> 00:13:02,595
for all your hard work?

276
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,364
Geez, Lois, is that
all you think about?

277
00:13:04,398 --> 00:13:05,432
I'm tired.

278
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:06,466
Come on, Peter.

279
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,467
I need this release.

280
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:08,935
I had a long
day at work.

281
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:10,403
Oh, work.

282
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:12,038
I suppose work
is why you missed

283
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:13,506
Chris's father-son picnic.

284
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,575
Peter, you're still
Chris's father.

285
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:16,910
Why can't you just listen

286
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:18,778
instead of trying
to fix everything?!

287
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:21,314
Get in here, Peter.

288
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:22,749
Don't you want to have sex?

289
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:25,418
I don't think we've done it
since I started working.

290
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:26,886
Yeah, I guess you're right.

291
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:30,356
Come on, where's my big,
strong man?

292
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:33,293
Putting on one of your
dress shirts to look sexy.

293
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:38,031
Mmm.

294
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:40,133
I want to do it on top
of the comforter.

295
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,735
I don't care if
we make streaks.

296
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:42,936
Well, of course <i>you</i> don't,

297
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,437
you're not the one
who cleans it.

298
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:46,906
Peter, just shut
up and take me!

299
00:13:51,212 --> 00:13:52,679
Peter, get up! Get up!

300
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:54,180
There's a caterpillar
in the bed!

301
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,249
Oh, that's, uh...
that's me.

302
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:57,283
What?

303
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:58,918
How do I put this
delicately?

304
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:02,255
My hog cannot partake
in the slop this evening.

305
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,759
Peter, are you having
trouble getting... ready?

306
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:07,494
Yes, obviously,
I'm having trouble!

307
00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:09,462
Well, somebody's gonna
have sex with me.

308
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:10,530
Lois, don't say that.

309
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:12,766
Quagmire will show up
like the Road Runner.

310
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,905
It's okay, your vagina's
just a painted-on hole.

311
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,617
Oh, Peter,
you're up.

312
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:27,918
That's not
what I heard.

313
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:31,288
Hey, Peter, you want
a little something

314
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:32,456
to put in that
orange juice?

315
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:33,691
What? Why? It's 9:00 a.m.

316
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:34,925
Well, I
figured you'd

317
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,660
like to start your day
with a stiff one.

318
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:39,630
You can't
get a boner!

319
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:42,199
You're a failure as
a man and a father.

320
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:44,368
Peter, it's nothing
to get upset about.

321
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:46,003
There's treatments
available.

322
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:47,505
We'll go see
Dr. Hartman.

323
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:49,340
I don't want to do that;
I'm embarrassed.

324
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:51,108
This shouldn't
embarrass you.

325
00:14:51,143 --> 00:14:53,344
The size should
embarrass you.

326
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,284
How about now? Is this
doing anything for you?

327
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:01,519
No.

328
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:04,789
Hmm. Well, what if
I show you my tattoo?

329
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:07,725
Nothing.
Well, you got a dead rat

330
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,793
in your
pants, mister.

331
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:10,494
There's got to be
something you can do,

332
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:11,529
Dr. Hartman.

333
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:13,030
Have you tried
getting a divorce?

334
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:15,166
I've never seen this
problem in a single man.

335
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,334
Doctor, what about
Viagra or Cialis?

336
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:18,536
What about them?

337
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,237
Well, if Peter
could try them,

338
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:21,839
they might help
with his problem.

339
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:23,174
Those are for man troubles?

340
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,643
I've been prescribing them
as antidepressants.

341
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:30,314
Everything's just getting
harder and harder.

342
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,686
Hey, you guys
want another round?

343
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,555
Oh, I don't know, Peter,
it's getting kind of late.

344
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:38,789
Yeah, I got
to get going.

345
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:40,825
It takes me three hours
to get ready for bed.

346
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:42,426
Oh, please don't
make me go home

347
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:43,661
and disappoint
my wife yet again!

348
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:45,016
What are you
talking about, Peter?

349
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,565
You know how earlier tonight
we all said we had erections?

350
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,566
I lied.

351
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,767
So did I.

352
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:51,836
Dr. Hartman says I'm impotent.

353
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,637
Oh, you don't have to
take that from him.

354
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:55,673
You know, Dr. Hartman
once told me I had gonorrhea.

355
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:57,708
So I hit him
in the head with a bat.

356
00:15:57,742 --> 00:16:00,845
I <i>give</i> gonorrhea,
I don't <i>get</i> gonorrhea. Okay?

357
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,346
It's terrible, guys.

358
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,348
I tried the pills he gave me,
but even they didn't work.

359
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:05,749
Well, look at it
this way, Peter:

360
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,017
without sex, you'll
have more time

361
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:09,019
to do the things you've
always wanted to do.

362
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:11,088
For me, it was learning
to play the trombone.

363
00:16:11,122 --> 00:16:13,157
Why the hell would you
want to play the trombone?

364
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:15,059
For moments
like this.

365
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:16,660
Peter can't
get an erection.

366
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:22,099
Peter, I am gonna help
you beat impotence.

367
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,434
We can do
this together.

368
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:25,202
Thanks, Quagmire,
'cause this sucks.

369
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:26,470
I think even the people

370
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:28,572
at the office supply store
can tell.

371
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:30,174
Um, excuse me,
where do you keep

372
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,442
your three-ring binders?

373
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:32,643
Those are on aisle...

374
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:34,178
Hold on a sec.

375
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:39,116
We're all out
of binders.

376
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:43,153
All right, Peter, now, when
it comes to curing impotence,

377
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:44,722
sometimes you
have to get creative.

378
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,713
So, we're gonna try
the Boston Method.

379
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:47,157
What's that?

380
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:49,793
Well, basically, some dirtbag
from Boston yells at your junk

381
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:51,428
to scare it
into working again.

382
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,131
So you got a
stupid penis, huh?

383
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:55,900
I-I guess so.

384
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:58,736
You hear me in there,
dum-dum? Let's look alive.

385
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,438
Listen, I could be nice about
this or I could get my brother.

386
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:02,940
And he did some
serious time

387
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:05,809
for throwing a turkey
off a bridge into a car.

388
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:07,311
It's-it's not working.

389
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:08,779
All right,
well, I got to go.

390
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:12,316
There's a ripped screen door
that needs slamming.

391
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,618
How could a town
with so many great colleges

392
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,787
produce nothing but dopes?

393
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:24,194
You sure this is
gonna work, Quagmire?

394
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:25,529
Of course. This isn't
the first time

395
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:26,830
I've rigged up
a sex puppet.

396
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:29,199
I now have full control
over your genitals.

397
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,034
Are you sure?

398
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:31,535
Yeah, check it out.

399
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:35,372
It looks like
an unmanned fire hose.

400
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:36,567
Stop smiling,
this is serious.

401
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:38,042
You got to have
your sex face.

402
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:41,979
Okay, okay, my sex face
is a ton of underbite.

403
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:43,113
Okay.

404
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:44,882
Lois, I'm ready.

405
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,720
Oh, Peter.

406
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:53,724
How about this?

407
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:57,628
Damn it, Peter,
I'll set the pace, you idiot.

408
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:59,263
All right, now to
let some line out.

409
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:00,731
Let her dance with it a little.

410
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:06,103
Oh, come on, Peter,
get out of my water glass.

411
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:07,504
I need to take a pill later.

412
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:10,174
Oh, sorry, I guess I need
to be a little more to the left.

413
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,309
A little more
to the left!

414
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:14,778
Come on, Quagmire, you were
a Navy pilot for six years.

415
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:16,013
Land this thing.

416
00:18:23,922 --> 00:18:26,357
Oh, Peter, that's new.

417
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:28,225
Let me try.

418
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:29,994
Eh, tired.

419
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:35,099
Nothing seems to be
working, you guys.

420
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,634
Is it gonna
be like this forever?

421
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:37,801
Yes.
No.

422
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:39,503
Yes.

423
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:42,006
Hold on, Peter. You didn't start
having trouble in the bedroom

424
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,340
until you lost
your job, right?

425
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,475
Yeah, so?

426
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:45,743
Well, that
explains it.

427
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,244
I mean, you've been
completely emasculated

428
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:48,912
because you're no longer
the breadwinner.

429
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:50,180
What are you
getting at, Quagmire?

430
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:51,315
There's only
one thing

431
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:52,650
that's gonna restore
your masculinity.

432
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:54,685
We got to get you
your old job back.

433
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:57,054
It was a mistake for me
to ever take that promotion.

434
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:58,222
Wait a minute.

435
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,691
It was a mistake
<i>giving</i> you a promotion.

436
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,559
Quagmire.

437
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:04,428
I'm not following you.

438
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:09,166
So, by promoting
an incompetent man,

439
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,434
<i>you</i> were at fault.

440
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:12,202
Nice try,
but I'm not the one

441
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:13,871
who drove a forklift
into a conference room

442
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:15,572
and sent two people
to the hospital.

443
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:17,708
Come on, since
this man lost his job,

444
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:19,076
he can't pleasure
his wife.

445
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,544
Is that true?

446
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:23,714
I-I have what the kids call
"maje wien probs."

447
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,716
Angela, I really
need my job back.

448
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,318
And I could stand here
and give you a big speech

449
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:31,522
about second chances and promise
to work harder than ever before.

450
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:34,458
And I could remind you that
one day you might be in my shoes

451
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,193
and maybe you'll need
a second chance.

452
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:37,428
But I'm not gonna do that.

453
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:39,396
I'm gonna cash in
this coupon you gave me

454
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:40,764
last Valentine's Day.

455
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,001
"One Redo For Being Fired
For Gross Negligence."

456
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:46,070
"And One Hug."

457
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:49,940
The hug one is expired, Griffin.

458
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:53,510
This one's for free.

459
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:55,579
Welcome back, Griffin.

460
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:56,814
Aw.

461
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:57,981
Who's that?

462
00:19:58,016 --> 00:20:01,251
Oh, I hired a studio audience
to do your old job.

463
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:02,519
You guys are fired.

464
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:04,655
Aw.

465
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:14,131
Peter, I can't
help you shake DVDs

466
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,399
out of the Redbox again.

467
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:17,034
I got in trouble last time.

468
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:18,702
Now, go away, I'm working.

469
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:22,439
You don't have to anymore,
because I got my old job back.

470
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:24,475
Peter, I'm so proud of you.

471
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:25,542
And you know what?

472
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:28,220
Something else is
working now, too.

473
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:29,287
Oh, my.

474
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:30,355
Let's go home.

475
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,624
No. I am gonna
do you right here

476
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:35,360
on a stack
of pita bread.

477
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:37,062
Oh, Peter.

478
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:40,265
Yeah, the bread's all
soft and doughy, isn't it?

479
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:42,034
And the inside of
the bag's always wet

480
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:44,336
because those hairy
dummies put it in too hot.

481
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,248
This is a cool place.

482
