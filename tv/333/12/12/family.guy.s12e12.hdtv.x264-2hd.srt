12
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:36,692
Peter, what are you doing?

13
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:38,327
I'm watching this
awesome show, Brian.

14
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:40,495
See, they took all these colors
and they're making 'em

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,197
all live together
in a beach house.

16
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:44,733
Now the red one is sleeping
with the green one.

17
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:47,269
And the blue one thinks he's
gonna have a career in music.

18
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:49,271
And the yellow one
is just a total bitch.

19
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:51,807
Peter, that's just a channel
that's gone off the air.

20
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:53,275
<i>And we'll be right back with</i>

21
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,745
<i>more</i> Color Bar Beach House
<i>after these messages.</i>

22
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:57,579
Oh.

23
00:00:57,614 --> 00:00:58,880
Peter, for God's sake,

24
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:01,116
did you eat this entire
roll of raw cookie dough?

25
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,284
Oh, is that what that was?

26
00:01:02,318 --> 00:01:03,986
I thought it was
a raisin sausage.

27
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,654
Peter, you're gonna get sick.

28
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:07,889
You can't just eat raw food
out of the fridge.

29
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:10,192
Eh, calm down,
people make mistakes.

30
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:13,228
Just look at the original design
for the first hybrid car.

31
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:15,397
Eric, we love the car.

32
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:17,265
We only want to
change <i>one</i> thing.

33
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,634
Is it the "rapist" sign?

34
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:20,202
Yes, it is the "rapist" sign.

35
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:21,403
I quit.

36
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,242
So, as you can see,
our quarterly output is up

37
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:28,677
one and a half percent.

38
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:31,179
That's not net,
I'm talking gross.

39
00:01:31,214 --> 00:01:34,016
You do everything gross.

40
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:40,022
<i>Stupid boring meeting.</i>
<i>I don't even want to be here.</i>

41
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:43,291
<i>I'd rather be home, doing</i>
<i>dramatic garage door reveals.</i>

42
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,946
And that gets us through
all projections...

43
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:07,115
<i>What was that?</i>

44
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:10,252
<i>Ah, that doesn't feel right.</i>

45
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:12,954
<i>Ah, man, I think that cookie</i>
<i>dough is fighting that taco</i>

46
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,656
<i>I found in the parking lot.</i>

47
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:17,159
<i>I just hope I can hold it in</i>
<i>until the meeting's over.</i>

48
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:21,163
And now, 23 minutes of silence
for the 23 workers

49
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:23,832
who drowned in
the vats this year.

50
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,735
Oh, God, it hurts.

51
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:27,569
It hurts.

52
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:29,071
Of course it hurts, Griffin.

53
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:31,239
They were good men,
all of them.

54
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:32,407
I can't hold it in!

55
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:34,309
You don't have to, Griffin!

56
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:35,377
Let it out!

57
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:37,145
That's what we're here for.

58
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,381
This was supposed to be
23 minutes of silence

59
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,483
and there's kind of a lot of
conversation going on.

60
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,520
Hey, Peter, my kid's selling
Girl Scout cookies and--

61
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:47,289
We're collecting for
Janet's pregnancy--

62
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:49,391
Softball sign-up--

63
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:50,625
Trick or treat for UNICEF--

64
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,194
Pitch in for Ed's
retirement cake?

65
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:53,462
Holiday party?

66
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:54,663
Whoa...!

67
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:55,657
Company picnic--

68
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:56,631
Secret Santa--

69
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,432
Carpool info--

70
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:01,069
Ah, finally, now I can
get myself to the--

71
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:06,608
Uh-oh...!

72
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,515
Ah, man, now everyone's gonna
remember me for this.

73
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,051
I wanted to be remembered
for my achievement in film.

74
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:43,478
There he is.

75
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:44,980
Oh, oh, I see!

76
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:46,748
Oh, you're all here
because you heard the news!

77
00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:47,916
Well, fine.

78
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,218
Peter Griffin crapped himself
at work. Happy?

79
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:50,897
Peter...

80
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,721
No, no, Lois,
l-l-let's get it all out.

81
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:55,157
I'm sure you <i>also</i> heard that
someone walked into my office

82
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:56,625
while I was sucking
on my own toes.

83
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:59,027
And do I go fast-walking
in nurse's shoes

84
00:03:59,061 --> 00:03:59,861
every Saturday in the park?

85
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:01,096
Yes, I do.

86
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,331
Peter, we're not here
because of any of that.

87
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,400
Okay, I know what
this is about.

88
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:06,995
Somebody saw me
holding hands with a guy

89
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,336
at Quiznos this morning.

90
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,872
All right, and was I involved in
the Oklahoma City bombing?

91
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:11,940
A little bit.

92
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:13,108
No, Peter,
you're not getting it.

93
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:14,810
Okay, we'll go deeper.

94
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:17,612
Yeah, I was swindled by that cat
who said he was from the future.

95
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,381
Turns out he was
just a present-day cat

96
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:20,682
with a smooth sales pitch.

97
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,017
Dad, you don't understand.

98
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:23,251
Oh, I understand.

99
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:25,654
I understand I've made
hundreds of deadly enemies

100
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,156
by shouting racial taunts
up at the jailhouse windows.

101
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,224
Oh, and another thing,

102
00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:31,259
raise your hand if you
think ducks are magic.

103
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:32,627
And... up it goes...!

104
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:33,829
Peter's the only one.

105
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:35,764
Peter, that's not
why they're here.

106
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:39,134
A-And no, none of us heard about
you soiling yourself at work.

107
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:40,235
Oh...

108
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:41,603
well why is everybody here?

109
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:43,939
Peter, your mother is dead.

110
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:46,942
She had a stroke this
afternoon and she died.

111
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,410
You don't die from that, Lois.

112
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:50,512
You just host New Year's Eve
and talk funny.

113
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:51,980
Peter, it's true.

114
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:53,949
I'm so sorry.

115
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:56,318
Oh, my God...

116
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:58,620
I don't believe it.

117
00:04:58,654 --> 00:05:00,989
She's gone?

118
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:03,959
All right, well, I'm gonna go
confuse everyone on Facebook

119
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:07,562
with a, "So sad, terrible day"
status and nothing more.

120
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:36,219
Your mother was
a good woman, Peter.

121
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:37,554
Thanks, Lois.

122
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,724
I just, I just can't believe
she's really gone.

123
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,059
And I can't believe this
funeral home has a skylight

124
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,495
with a sinister clown
staring down at us.

125
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:49,699
Thank you for coming, everyone.

126
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:52,736
We're here to celebrate
the life of Thelma Griffin.

127
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,972
Here to say a few words
about Thelma is her son, Peter.

128
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,876
My mother always hoped
to be buried

129
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:01,411
with her pet cat, Mittens,

130
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,114
so I'd like to thank
the Quahog Veterinary Society

131
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:06,016
for putting Mittens down
so quickly.

132
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,785
Yeah, just-just go ahead
and toss it in there.

133
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,954
P-Probably, probably just
stuff it in by the feet.

134
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:15,959
Okay, I will now take
questions from the audience.

135
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:18,862
No? None? They don't
have to be about my mom.

136
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:21,564
Is anyone else here watching
<i>Revolution</i> and wanting

137
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,366
to talk about it after this?

138
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:24,567
No! No! No! No!

139
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:25,936
I'm not caught up!
I'm not caught up!

140
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,706
Lotta white socks with
dress shoes in this bitch.

141
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,974
God, I hate funerals.

142
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:32,108
Yeah, they're stupid.

143
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,843
Thank God I'm not
going to die.

144
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:35,278
What do you mean?
Of course you are.

145
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:36,613
I'm not gonna die, Brian.

146
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,081
I'm like Jim Belushi.

147
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:40,483
I am worried about
my funny brother, though.

148
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:42,018
Food fight!

149
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,823
This is tragic, but will
also open a door for me.

150
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,925
Stewie, everyone is
gonna die, at some point.

151
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,826
Everyone.

152
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,895
So like... even me?

153
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:52,896
Yes, even you.

154
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,631
You are going
to die someday, Stewie.

155
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,734
Wow... I guess you learn
something new everyday.

156
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,369
Like the Black Eyed Peas.

157
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,104
Hey, what's that?

158
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,639
This is a guitar.

159
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,174
Wow...

160
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:13,216
Oh, Peter, look,
your mom's old photo albums.

161
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,852
Oh, look at your
little baby footprints.

162
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:18,488
Yeah, my mom took my footprint
every single year.

163
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,127
When I was eight,
I was a dragon.

164
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:29,466
Oh, hello.
You must be Cocoon.

165
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,135
We don't have any rocks to make
you stronger here, but welcome.

166
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:34,604
You must be Peter.

167
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:36,806
I'm Evelyn, a friend
of your mother's.

168
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:38,174
Oh, oh, hi.

169
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,175
This is my family.

170
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,643
They're of no comfort.

171
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:43,279
Oh... I know it's tough
what you're going through.

172
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:47,183
You're where I was 17 years ago,
when I lost my husband, Walter.

173
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,119
He died of pancreatic cancer.

174
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:51,221
That sounds sad,
but I didn't know him.

175
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:53,156
Man, I miss my mom so much.

176
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,925
Well, I knew your mother
better than anyone.

177
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,761
I could tell you stories...

178
00:07:57,795 --> 00:07:59,562
Well, that sounds nice.

179
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,965
Peter, the two of you
should hang out together.

180
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:03,733
I'd like that very much.

181
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:06,903
Well, it's 4:00.
I'm off to bed.

182
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:09,406
Wow, Peter, looks like
you made a new friend.

183
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,574
Yeah... a-and maybe
she can be my new mom,

184
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:13,476
you know, just like Greg
Evigan and Paul Reiser

185
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:15,311
were briefly my two dads.

186
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:16,880
I keep forgetting your names.

187
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:20,250
Can you just be "Jew Dad"
and you'll be "Earring Dad?"

188
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,196
Stewie, could you please
stop tossing and turning?

189
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,264
It's hard enough
to sleep in here

190
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,099
without my memory
foam pillow.

191
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,635
Uh... don't tell me,
don't tell me...

192
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,836
Brian!
Yep.

193
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,171
Yeah...

194
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,306
I can't go to sleep,
Brian-- I'm scared!

195
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,107
Of what?

196
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,175
Of death!

197
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,509
Well, you're not alone.

198
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:48,611
The world is full of people
who can't accept death.

199
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:49,846
And they've all got
their own ideas

200
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,181
of what happens when we die.

201
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:52,248
Really? Like what?

202
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,417
Tell me, are any of them
blindly reassuring?

203
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,652
Look, it's late.

204
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,087
We'll talk about it
first thing tomorrow.

205
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,354
Geez, you know, I gotta say,

206
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:00,723
it's weird to see you
so worked up about this.

207
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:02,125
I mean, you're
not afraid of anything.

208
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,560
Even that monster
in your closet.

209
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:05,328
Ah, he's on his way
out of here.

210
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:07,330
Ever since he violated
the section of his lease

211
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:09,499
that doesn't
allow subletters.

212
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,433
What are you talking about?

213
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,068
I don't have
anyone else in here.

214
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:14,504
Just tell him
the truth, Ethan.

215
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,007
Thank you for doing this, Brian.

216
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,109
No problem, Stewie.

217
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,911
Our first stop today
is a Jewish synagogue.

218
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:25,281
Wow, every brick in this place
is named after someone.

219
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,050
Yeah, they do that
to honor their donors.

220
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:30,086
So that side of the building
was donated by someone named,

221
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:31,421
"Get Out of Our Town"?

222
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,490
No, I-I-I think that was
the work of some

223
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:34,757
shaved-headed gentleman,

224
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,793
but, but we're here
to talk about Judaism.

225
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,728
So, where do they think
they go when they die?

226
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:40,396
Well, you should try
asking the rabbi.

227
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:42,732
Although, I should warn you,
you might not get an answer.

228
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:45,568
So, where do Jewish people
think they go when they die?

229
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:47,303
Where do you think we go?

230
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,072
Well, I don't know.
That's why I'm asking you.

231
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:51,674
Why do you think you're
asking all these questions?

232
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:53,776
I-I just, I just really
want to know what happens.

233
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:56,713
Do you think that's
part of God's infinite plan?

234
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:59,282
I think your whole religion
is a sham, just so you can get

235
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:00,950
extra holidays off from work.

236
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,485
Oop, gotta go.
It's Buchwuch.

237
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:10,760
I say, this is quite impressive.

238
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:12,962
Buddhism is an
Asian religion that also has

239
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:15,165
a significant following
of annoying white people.

240
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:15,752
Okay.

241
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:17,700
See, these guys believe
that after you die,

242
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,335
you're reincarnated
and you come back

243
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,371
as a pig or a cow
or a rooster.

244
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:22,739
Okay, okay, that's good.

245
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:24,941
I already know what noises
to make if I'm one of those.

246
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:27,055
But they also don't believe
in demonstrating emotions

247
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:28,878
either way, so they're
the worst people

248
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,446
to buy birthday gifts for.

249
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:32,515
I know you've been having
trouble getting around,

250
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,317
so I bought you a new Lexus.

251
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:36,119
And I got you
this tie clip.

252
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:38,621
Thank you both.
These are equal to me.

253
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:41,224
Screw you!
You don't even own a tie!

254
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:48,631
Now, the Catholics believe that
as long as you accept Jesus

255
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,934
before you die, anyone
can get into Heaven.

256
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:52,135
Really? Anyone?

257
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,007
I accept Jesus
as my Lord and Savior!

258
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:01,177
Yes!

259
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:08,318
Peter, thank you so much for
your help in making this cake,

260
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:09,986
but don't you think
it would be easier

261
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,387
if you stood
on the floor?

262
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,423
Yeah, but when I baked
with my mom,

263
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:15,024
I always stood
on a chair.

264
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,994
Another memory is my Uncle Roy
putting his thumb in me.

265
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:20,697
Ah, the best memories
are family memories.

266
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:23,199
Oh, hey, Evelyn,
I got a riddle for you:

267
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:25,702
What newspaper
do cows read?

268
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:27,637
The <i>Moo York Times.</i>

269
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:30,006
That's very clever, Peter.
Did you make that up?

270
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,708
Nah, I got it off
a yogurt.

271
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:33,209
Still, very impressive.

272
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:34,510
God, you know, Evelyn,

273
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:36,312
you've really helped me
through a tough time.

274
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,181
I haven't been
this grateful

275
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,049
since I met
the Sane Hatter.

276
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,252
Excuse me. How do I get back
through the looking glass?

277
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,586
Oh, yeah,
take two lefts

278
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:45,488
and it's the first
door on your right.

279
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:46,522
Cool. Great.

280
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:48,091
Thanks for not giving me
the runaround.

281
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,459
I-I asked that guy
over there,

282
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,794
but he just told me
a bunch of rhyming nonsense.

283
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:54,998
Oh, yeah-- he's, like,
a well-known dick.

284
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:01,904
What are you
still doing awake?

285
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:03,139
Changing the oil in my car!

286
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:04,741
What the hell do you think
I'm doing?!

287
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:07,577
Sorry, I stole that from the
Italian family next door.

288
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:09,312
They've been going
at it all night.

289
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:11,648
Dad, can I have five dollars
for lunch tomorrow?

290
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:13,816
Yeah, sure, just
let me just go check

291
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:15,518
my room full
of gold and jewels.

292
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:18,955
You see, every first thing
he says is not the real thing.

293
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,057
Anyway, Brian, I'm trying
to figure out death!

294
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:23,326
It's not that
complicated, Stewie.

295
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,528
Well, which of these religions
has the right answer?

296
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:26,696
What-What about
you, Brian?

297
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,665
What do you believe
happens when you die?

298
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,667
Nothing.
Lights out. That's it.

299
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,568
That's not comforting at all!

300
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:34,370
Well, I just think
it's pretty clear

301
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,572
that we're all just bags
of bones and flesh

302
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,841
that eventually break down
and decay into worm food.

303
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:41,177
We come from nothing,
and we're gonna become nothing.

304
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:42,545
The end.
Night, Stewie.

305
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:46,049
Lights out.

306
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,017
Did you hear him, Rupert?

307
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:50,019
Life is just a big joke.

308
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:52,455
It's just sitting
around waiting to die.

309
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,123
Well, I can't live like that.

310
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:55,458
I'd rather just end it.

311
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,093
I'm going to take my own life.

312
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,696
But first, I'm gonna play ball
in the house.

313
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,899
Parents are right!

314
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:09,939
We now return to
<i>S.T., the Special Terrestrial.</i>

315
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,978
Hi!

316
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:17,347
Hey, guys,
this is Evelyn.

317
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,048
She's the one
with that bathroom carpet

318
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,184
I've been peeing on
I told you about.

319
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,552
Hey, nice to meet you.

320
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:24,721
You know, instead
of drawing on your eyebrows,

321
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:26,522
maybe just go without
eyebrows.

322
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,092
And I'm Joe Swanson.

323
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,361
I've been dying to introduce
you guys to Evelyn.

324
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,196
We've just been having
the best time together.

325
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,630
Evelyn, tell them
how many sodas

326
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,165
I combined at the movie theater.
Two.

327
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,468
It was more than that.
She fell asleep.

328
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:42,138
She let me drive
a little bit on the way home.

329
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,539
Just in the parking lot.

330
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,708
But you were a good
little navigator.

331
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,380
Yeah, I just remembered, I gotta
get the hell out of here.

332
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,619
Well, God said I could
walk just one time.

333
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:59,789
I was saving it for
Susie's wedding day, but...

334
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,761
Your friends seem lovely.

335
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:06,095
Ah, they a'ight.

336
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,132
You know, Evelyn, I am having
such a good time with you.

337
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,967
You're like
my aboveground mom.

338
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,236
Oh, Peter, you know, sometimes

339
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,138
I think your mother
brought us together.

340
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:16,806
Yeah, tha-that's how I feel.

341
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,007
Good.

342
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,988
Come on. Are you molesting me
or watching TV?

343
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:39,132
I can't believe that
old woman kissed you!

344
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,400
Oh, it was horrible, Lois.

345
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:42,636
There were still crumbs
in the corners of her mouth

346
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,339
from that Nilla Wafer
she had at lunch.

347
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:47,574
Are you sure there wasn't
some kind of misunderstanding?

348
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:49,343
No, no, those were
definitely Nilla Wafers.

349
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:51,345
And it really
bums me out, you know,

350
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:53,613
'cause I thought she was
something special.

351
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:55,482
She was like a mom to me.

352
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:57,718
Well, then you should
go talk to her

353
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,286
and try to clear
this up.

354
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,688
It sounds weird, but
maybe it was innocent.

355
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,523
I mean, this wouldn't
be the first time

356
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:05,258
you thought someone
was hitting on you.

357
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,394
Would you like
to add chips and a drink?

358
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:09,196
Here we go again.

359
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:16,303
All right, Rupert, here we go.

360
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,176
Well, I'm not dead,
but I do have a boner.

361
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:26,346
So that is something new
about Stewie.

362
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:31,084
Okay, death by cop.

363
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:35,288
Hey, copper, come get me!

364
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:37,257
Oh, no, an armed assailant!

365
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,493
I definitely don't want
to die today.

366
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:42,662
I have so much
to live for.

367
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:44,131
Come on! Shoot me!

368
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:46,967
The one day I don't wear
my bulletproof vest!

369
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,102
What are you waiting for?
I'm wide open!

370
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:51,638
Don't you hate how the heart
is right about here?

371
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:54,040
Just kiss, you fruitcakes!

372
00:15:58,012 --> 00:16:01,047
All right, Rupert, the old
toaster in the tub never fails.

373
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:10,991
Oh, damn, I wanted to die,
not turn into Toaster Man.

374
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:15,662
I don't know
about this Toaster Man.

375
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:18,331
While he's getting all the
glory, John Q. Taxpayer is left

376
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,733
to clean up the crumbs.

377
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:24,304
My breakfast bread
just got perfectly browned!

378
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:26,473
I just wish I could thank him!

379
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,141
Oh, I think he knows, Pop.

380
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:30,577
I think he knows.

381
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,249
Evelyn, we need to talk.

382
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,985
Oh, Peter,
I owe you an apology.

383
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,088
I'm afraid my new medicine
made me act foolishly yesterday.

384
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:44,191
You must forgive me.
Oh.

385
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:47,260
So it-it was, it was
just your medicine, huh?

386
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,296
Well, I guess I can
understand that.

387
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,131
You know, I'm addicted
to nasal spray.

388
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:55,735
I smell everything!
I'm invincible!

389
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,575
I'm probably gonna be
a little down

390
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:03,577
until I use
the spray again.

391
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:05,779
That's okay, Peter.
Now come along.

392
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:08,748
I've got quite the day
planned for us.

393
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:11,818
♪ She's just a devil woman

394
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,753
♪ With evil on her mind

395
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:16,156
♪ Beware the devil woman

396
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,158
♪ She's gonna get you

397
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:20,026
♪ She's just a devil woman

398
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:22,262
♪ With evil on her mind

399
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:23,763
♪ Beware the devil woman

400
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:26,299
♪ She's gonna get you
from behind. ♪

401
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,776
Evelyn, I think it's best

402
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,678
that we don't see
each other anymore.

403
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:39,779
But Peter...

404
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:41,181
No, Evelyn, I trusted you,

405
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:42,949
and all this funny business
keeps happening,

406
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:44,918
and I don't think
it's your medicine at all.

407
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:47,020
So I'm afraid this is good-bye.

408
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:49,523
But Peter, I thought
we were friends.

409
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,258
Yeah, right.
You tricked me!

410
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,860
You're as bad as those
predators on the Internet.

411
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:55,462
That's wild, Stacey.

412
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:58,465
I'm a 12-year-old girl, too.

413
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,567
My name's Jenny.

414
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:04,104
Want to come over to my place
and help me move?

415
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:08,675
Hey, you're not
a 12-year-old girl!

416
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:10,777
Neither are you, Jenny!

417
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:13,380
Huh. I guess we aren't
so different after all.

418
00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:15,549
Yeah. You know, this isn't
a whole lot of stuff.

419
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,884
We can probably knock
this out in an hour.

420
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:27,460
What the hell?!

421
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:30,230
Stewie, what the hell
are you doing?!

422
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:33,166
He's doing his taxes!
What's it look like he's doing?

423
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,335
Vito, get away from
the neighbors' house!

424
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:36,670
I'm killing myself,
Brian.

425
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:38,338
You said it yourself,
when we die,

426
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,507
there's nothing!
We just rot in the ground!

427
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,775
Well, if life has
no purpose,

428
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:43,410
why not just cut
to the chase?

429
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:44,878
Look, Stewie, I know
you're worried,

430
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:47,314
but you can't live your life
being scared of death.

431
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:48,815
Nobody knows
what comes next,

432
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,384
so all we can do is pack
the most we can

433
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:52,752
into each day we've got.

434
00:18:52,787 --> 00:18:54,287
So for you,
that's taking

435
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:56,790
a 45-minute shaky-leg poop
on the front lawn?

436
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:57,991
I'm just saying
there's something

437
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,826
to be said for living
in the moment.

438
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,328
So what you're saying is

439
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:03,229
I've got to find
<i>my</i> shaky-leg poop.

440
00:19:03,264 --> 00:19:05,031
Exactly.

441
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:06,499
Well, I-I have
always wanted

442
00:19:06,534 --> 00:19:08,535
to be a singer-songwriter.

443
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:11,071
Um... yeah. No, yeah,
you could do that.

444
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:12,372
You-You paused.

445
00:19:12,406 --> 00:19:13,540
Why-Why did you pause?

446
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:15,442
Uh... no reason.

447
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,444
You did it again!
I swear to God,

448
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:19,412
I will throw myself
right out that window!

449
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,915
Okay, welcome
to the Apple Tree Pub.

450
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:24,284
I'm Stewie Griffin,
and these...

451
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:26,953
are my six assistants.

452
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,321
You know,
I changed my mind.

453
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:29,856
Kill yourself.

454
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:36,663
Hey, Mom, I-I gotta talk
to you about something.

455
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,798
You know, ever since
you turned into a rock

456
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,133
with your name on it,

457
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:43,169
your friend's been
really inappropriate with me.

458
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:45,138
Hello, Peter.

459
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,272
Oh. Hi.

460
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:48,108
What are you doing here?

461
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,976
Peter, I want
to apologize.

462
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:52,445
I <i>did</i> behave
inappropriately.

463
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,581
It's just that since my beloved
Walter died,

464
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:57,617
you're the first man who's paid
any attention to me,

465
00:19:57,652 --> 00:20:00,654
and I guess I took advantage
of that.

466
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:02,122
Huh.

467
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:04,724
Well, you know, when-when
you put it that way,

468
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,061
I guess maybe it's a little bit
my fault, too.

469
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:10,163
I missed my mom so much,

470
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:14,300
and I guess maybe I sort of
used you as a replacement.

471
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:17,504
I'm glad we
became friends, Evelyn.

472
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:29,382
Evelyn? Evelyn?!

473
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:48,722
Looks like somebody's mom died
or something,

474
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:51,276
I don't know. You--You'll take
care of this, right?

475
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:56,277
