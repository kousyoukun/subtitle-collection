Here to say a few words
about Thelma is her son, Peter.

143

so quickly.

Yeah, just-just go ahead
and toss it in there.

148

P-Probably, probably just
stuff it in by the feet.

149

Okay, I will now take
questions from the audience.

150
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,544
No? None? They don't
have to be about my mom.

151
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,247
Is anyone else here watching

I'm not gonna die, Brian.

161
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:38,764
I'm like Jim Belushi.

162
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:41,233
I am worried about
my funny brother, though.

163
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,734
Food fight!

164
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,236
(groans)

165
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,572
This is tragic, but will
also open a door for me.

166
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,674
Stewie, everyone is
gonna die, at some point.

167
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,575
Everyone.

168
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,611
So like... even me?

169
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,845
Yes, even you.

170
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,280
You are going
to die someday, Stewie.

171
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,417
Wow... I guess you learn
something new everyday.

172
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,085
Like the Black Eyed Peas.

173
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,753
Hey, what's that?

174
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,355
This is a guitar.

175
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:05,090
Wow...

176
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,932
Oh, Peter, look,
your mom's old photo albums.

177
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,468
Oh, look at your
little baby footprints.

178
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,371
Yeah, my mom took my footprint
every single year.

179
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,810
When I was eight,
I was a dragon.

180
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,178
(knocking on door)

181
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,148
Oh, hello.
You must be Cocoon.

182
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,818
We don't have any rocks to make
you stronger here, but welcome.

183
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,952
(laughing)

184
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,287
You must be Peter.

185
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,489
I'm Evelyn, a friend
of your mother's.

186
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,890
Oh, oh, hi.

187
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,891
This is my family.

188
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,460
They're of no comfort.

189
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,962
Oh... I know it's tough
what you're going through.

190
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,899
You're where I was 17 years ago,
when I lost my husband, Walter.

191
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,801
He died of pancreatic cancer.

192
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,970
That sounds sad,
but I didn't know him.

193
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,805
Man, I miss my mom so much.

194
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,641
Well, I knew your mother
better than anyone.

195
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,477
I could tell you stories...

196
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,312
Well, that sounds nice.

197
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,681
Peter, the two of you
should hang out together.

198
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,416
I'd like that very much.

199
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,652
Well, it's 4:00.
I'm off to bed.

200
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,021
Wow, Peter, looks like
you made a new friend.

201
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,257
Yeah... a-and maybe
she can be my new mom,

202
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,159
you know, just like Greg
Evigan and Paul Reiser

203
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,027
were briefly my two dads.

204
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,596
I keep forgetting your names.

205
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,166
Can you just be "Jew Dad"
and you'll be "Earring Dad?"

206
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,879
Stewie, could you please
stop tossing and turning?

207
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,013
It's hard enough
to sleep in here

208
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,848
without my memory
foam pillow.

209
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,351
Uh... don't tell me,
don't tell me...

210
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,519
Brian!
Yep.

211
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,853
Yeah...

212
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,022
I can't go to sleep,
Brian-- I'm scared!

213
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:44,856
Of what?

214
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,891
Of death!

215
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,459
Well, you're not alone.

216
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,294
The world is full of people
who can't accept death.

217
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,529
And they've all got
their own ideas

218
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,897
of what happens when we die.

219
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,231
Really? Like what?

220
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,200
Tell me, are any of them
blindly reassuring?

221
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,535
Look, it's late.

222
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,869
We'll talk about it
first thing tomorrow.

223
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,237
Geez, you know, I gotta say,

224
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,239
it's weird to see you
so worked up about this.

225
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,741
I mean, you're
not afraid of anything.

226
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,242
Even that monster
in your closet.

227
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,044
Ah, he's on his way
out of here.

228
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,046
Ever since he violated
the section of his lease

229
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,215
that doesn't
allow subletters.

230
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,316
What are you talking about?

231
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,717
I don't have
anyone else in here.

232
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,453
Just tell him
the truth, Ethan.

233
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,723
Thank you for doing this, Brian.

234
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,058
No problem, Stewie.

235
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,594
Our first stop today
is a Jewish synagogue.

236
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,897
Wow, every brick in this place
is named after someone.

237
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,732
Yeah, they do that
to honor their donors.

238
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,835
So that side of the building
was donated by someone named,

239
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,103
"Get Out of Our Town"?

240
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,239
No, I-I-I think that was
the work of some

241
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,607
shaved-headed gentlemen,

242
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,509
but, but we're here
to talk about Judaism.

243
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,411
So, where do they think
they go when they die?

244
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,079
Well, you should try
asking the rabbi.

245
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,415
Although, I should warn you,
you might not get an answer.

246
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,251
So, where do Jewish people
think they go when they die?

247
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,019
Where do you think we go?

248
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,688
Well, I don't know.
That's why I'm asking you.

249
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,424
Why do you think you're
asking all these questions?

250
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,426
I-I just, I just really
want to know what happens.

251
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,429
Do you think that's
part of God's infinite plan?

252
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,031
I think your whole religion
is a sham, just so you can get

253
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,600
extra holidays off from work.

254
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,368
Oop, gotta go.
It's Buchwuch.

255
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,443
I say, this is quite impressive.

256
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,612
Buddhism is an
Asian religion that also has

257
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,714
a significant following
of annoying white people.

258
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,283
Okay.
See, these guys believe
that after you die,

259
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,951
you're reincarnated
and you come back

260
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,120
as a pig or a cow
or a rooster.

261
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,655
Okay, okay, that's good.

262
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,557
I already know what noises
to make if I'm one of those.

263
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,726
But they also don't believe
in demonstrating emotions

264
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,628
either way, so they're
the worst people

265
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,129
to buy birthday gifts for.

266
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,231
I know you've been having
trouble getting around,

267
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,966
so I bought you a new Lexus.

268
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,801
And I got you
this tie clip.

269
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,237
Thank you both.
These are equal to me.

270
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,140
Screw you!
You don't even own a tie!

271
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,314
Now, the Catholics believe that
as long as you accept Jesus

272
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,650
before you die, anyone
can get into Heaven.

273
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,051
Really? Anyone?

274
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,890
I accept Jesus
as my Lord and Savior!

275
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,060
Yes!

276
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,000
Peter, thank you so much for
your help in making this cake,

277
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,669
but don't you think
it would be easier

278
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,037
if you stood
on the floor?

279
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,039
Yeah, but when I baked
with my mom,

280
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,840
I always stood
on a chair.

281
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,677
Another memory is
my Uncle Roy putting
his thumb in me.

282
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,346
Ah, the best memories
are family memories.

283
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,848
Oh, hey, Evelyn,
I got a riddle for you:

284
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,384
What newspaper
do cows read?

285
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,353
The <i>Moo York Times.</i>

286
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,622
That's very clever, Peter.
Did you make that up?

287
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,457
Nah, I got it off
a yogurt.

288
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,892
Still, very impressive.

289
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,393
God, you know, Evelyn,

290
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,895
you've really helped me
through a tough time.

291
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,863
I haven't been
this grateful

292
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,732
since I met
the Sane Hatter.

293
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,867
Excuse me. How do I get back
through the looking glass?

294
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,302
Oh, yeah,
take two lefts

295
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,204
and it's the first
door on your right.

296
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,405
Cool. Great.

297
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,807
Thanks for not giving me
the runaround.

298
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,241
I-I asked that guy
over there,

299
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,410
but he just told me
a bunch of rhyming nonsense.

300
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,947
Oh, yeah-- he's, like,
a well-known dick.

301
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,587
What are you
still doing awake?

302
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,922
Changing the oil in my car!

303
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,657
What the hell do you think
I'm doing?!

304
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,226
Sorry, I stole that from the
Italian family next door.

305
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,994
They've been going
at it all night.

306
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,330
GIRL:
Dad, can I have five dollars
for lunch tomorrow?

307
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,499
MAN:
Yeah, sure, just
let me just go check

308
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,234
my room full
of gold and jewels.

309
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,604
You see, every first thing
he says is not the real thing.

310
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,740
Anyway, Brian, I'm trying
to figure out death!

311
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,942
It's not that
complicated, Stewie.

312
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,111
Well, which of these religions
has the right answer?

313
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,612
What-What about
you, Brian?

314
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,347
What do you believe
happens when you die?

315
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,416
Nothing.
Lights out. That's it.

316
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,184
That's not comforting at all!

317
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,019
Well, I just think
it's pretty clear

318
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,188
that we're all just bags
of bones and flesh

319
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,524
that eventually break down
and decay into worm food.

320
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,926
We come from nothing,
and we're gonna
become nothing.

321
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,495
The end.
Night, Stewie.

322
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,765
Lights out.

323
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,767
Did you hear him, Rupert?

324
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,635
Life is just a big joke.

325
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:53,138
It's just sitting
around waiting to die.

326
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,873
Well, I can't live like that.

327
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,141
I'd rather just end it.

328
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,709
I'm going to take my own life.

329
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:00,612
But first, I'm gonna play ball
in the house.

330
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,848
(gasps)
Parents are right!

331
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,855
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to
<i>S.T., the Special Terrestrial.</i>

332
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,661
Hi!

333
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,062
Hey, guys,
this is Evelyn.

334
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,798
She's the one
with that bathroom carpet

335
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,900
I've been peeing on
I told you about.

336
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,401
Hey, nice to meet you.

337
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,336
You know, instead
of drawing on your eyebrows,

338
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,305
maybe just go without
eyebrows.

339
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,808
And I'm Joe Swanson.

340
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,076
I've been dying to introduce
you guys to Evelyn.

341
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,912
We've just been having
the best time together.

342
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,313
Evelyn, tell them
how many sodas

343
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,815
I combined
at the movie theater.

344
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,150
Two.
It was more than that.
She fell asleep.

345
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,854
She let me drive
a little bit on the way home.

346
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,155
Just in the parking lot.

347
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,591
But you were a good
little navigator.

348
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,262
Yeah, I just remembered, I gotta
get the hell out of here.

349
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,202
Well, God said I could
walk just one time.

350
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,738
I was saving it for
Susie's wedding day, but...

351
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,510
Your friends seem lovely.

352
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,111
Ah, they a'ight.

353
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,848
You know, Evelyn, I am having
such a good time with you.

354
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,683
You're like
my aboveground mom.

355
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,852
Oh, Peter, you know, sometimes

356
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,854
I think your mother
brought us together.

357
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,522
Yeah, tha-that's how I feel.

358
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,923
Good.

359
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,428
(whimpering)

360
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,534
<i>(The Price Is Right</i>
<i>theme plays)</i>

361
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,937
Come on. Are you molesting me
or watching TV?

362
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,646
I can't believe that
old woman kissed you!

363
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,147
Oh, it was horrible, Lois.

364
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,083
There were still crumbs
in the corners of her mouth

365
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,719
from that Nilla Wafer
she had at lunch.

366
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,054
Are you sure there wasn't
some kind of misunderstanding?

367
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,823
No, no, those were
definitely Nilla Wafers.

368
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,825
And it really
bums me out, you know,

369
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,094
'cause I thought she was
something special.

370
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,896
She was like a mom to me.

371
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,231
Well, then you should
go talk to her

372
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,599
and try to clear
this up.

373
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,068
It sounds weird, but
maybe it was innocent.

374
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,904
I mean, this wouldn't
be the first time

375
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,739
you thought someone
was hitting on you.

376
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,908
Would you like
to add chips and a drink?

377
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,843
Here we go again.

378
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,983
All right, Rupert, here we go.

379
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,590
Well, I'm not dead,
but I do have a boner.

380
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,993
So that is something new
about Stewie.

381
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,765
Okay, death by cop.

382
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,769
Hey, copper, come get me!

383
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,771
(flatly):
Oh, no, an armed assailant!

384
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,940
I definitely don't want
to die today.

385
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,109
I have so much
to live for.

386
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,611
Come on! Shoot me!

387
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,314
The one day I don't wear
my bulletproof vest!

388
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,616
What are you waiting for?
I'm wide open!

389
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,118
Don't you hate how the heart
is right about here?

390
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,688
Just kiss, you fruitcakes!

391
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,695
All right, Rupert, the old
toaster in the tub never fails.

392
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,030
(gasping, shuddering)

393
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,705
Oh, damn, I wanted to die,
not turn into Toaster Man.

394
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,142
I don't know
about this Toaster Man.

395
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,812
While he's getting all the
glory, John Q. Taxpayer is left

396
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,180
to clean up the crumbs.

397
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,848
(zap)

398
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,818
(gasps) My breakfast bread
just got perfectly browned!

399
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,987
I just wish I could thank him!

400
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,655
Oh, I think he knows, Pop.

401
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,224
I think he knows.

402
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,763
Evelyn, we need to talk.

403
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,432
Oh, Peter,
I owe you an apology.

404
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,602
I'm afraid
my new medicine made me
act foolishly yesterday.

405
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,671
You must forgive me.
Oh.

406
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,674
So it-it was, it was
just your medicine, huh?

407
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,676
Well, I guess I can
understand that.

408
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,778
You know, I'm addicted
to nasal spray.

409
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,416
I smell everything!
I'm invincible!

410
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,886
(panting)

411
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,022
I'm probably gonna be
a little down

412
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,024
until I use
the spray again.

413
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,192
That's okay, Peter.
Now come along.

414
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,429
I've got quite the day
planned for us.

415
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,298
♪ She's just a devil woman

416
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,200
♪ With evil on her mind

417
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,703
♪ Beware the devil woman

418
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,638
♪ She's gonna get you

419
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,540
♪ She's just a devil woman

420
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,709
♪ With evil on her mind

421
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,210
♪ Beware the devil woman

422
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,946
♪ She's gonna get you
from behind. ♪

423
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,157
Evelyn, I think it's best

424
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,225
that we don't see
each other anymore.

425
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,226
But Peter...

426
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,661
No, Evelyn, I trusted you,

427
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,329
and all this funny business
keeps happening,

428
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,398
and I don't think
it's your medicine at all.

429
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,434
So I'm afraid this is good-bye.

430
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,936
But Peter, I thought
we were friends.

431
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,604
Yeah, right.
You tricked me!

432
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,340
You're as bad as those
predators on the Internet.

433
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,909
That's wild, Stacey.

434
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,945
I'm a 12-year-old girl, too.

435
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,914
My name's Jenny.

436
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,584
Want to come over to my place
and help me move?

437
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,486
(doorbell rings)

438
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,122
Hey, you're not
a 12-year-old girl!

439
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,257
Neither are you, Jenny!

440
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,760
Huh. I guess we aren't
so different after all.

441
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,962
Yeah. You know, this isn't
a whole lot of stuff.

442
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,531
We can probably knock
this out in an hour.

443
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,174
What the hell?!

444
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,710
Stewie, what the hell
are you doing?!

445
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,613
MAN:
He's doing his taxes!
What's it look like he's doing?

446
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,782
WOMAN:
Vito, get away from
the neighbors' house!

447
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,117
I'm killing myself,
Brian.

448
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,785
You said it yourself,
when we die,

449
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,954
there's nothing!
We just rot in the ground!

450
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,288
Well, if life has
no purpose,

451
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,823
why not just cut
to the chase?

452
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,458
Look, Stewie, I know
you're worried,

453
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,794
but you can't live your life
being scared of death.

454
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,229
Nobody knows
what comes next,

455
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,898
so all we can do is pack
the most we can

456
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,233
into each day we've got.

457
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,801
So for you,
that's taking

458
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,170
a 45-minute shaky-leg poop
on the front lawn?

459
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,571
I'm just saying
there's something

460
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,240
to be said for living
in the moment.

461
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,808
So what you're saying is

462
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,676
I've got to find
<i>my</i> shaky-leg poop.

463
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,478
Exactly.

464
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,980
Well, I-I have
always wanted

465
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,915
to be a singer-songwriter.

466
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,584
Um... yeah. No, yeah,
you could do that.

467
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,852
You-you paused.

468
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,020
Why-why did you pause?

469
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,922
Uh... no reason.

470
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,924
You did it again!
I swear to God,

471
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,859
I will throw myself
right out that window!

472
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,362
Okay, welcome
to the Apple Tree Pub.

473
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,831
I'm Stewie Griffin,
and these...

474
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,333
are my six assistants.

475
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,835
You know,
I changed my mind.

476
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,503
Kill yourself.

477
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,010
Hey, Mom, I-I gotta talk
to you about something.

478
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,212
You know, ever since
you turned into a rock

479
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,780
with your name on it,

480
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,683
your friend's been
really inappropriate with me.

481
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,552
Hello, Peter.

482
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,719
Oh. Hi.

483
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,521
What are you doing here?

484
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,390
Peter, I want
to apologize.

485
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,859
I  <i>did</i>behave
inappropriately.

486
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,961
It's just that since
my beloved Walter died,

487
00:19:56,963 --> 00:20:00,031
you're the first man who's paid
any attention to me,

488
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,067
and I guess I took advantage
of that.

489
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,535
Huh.

490
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,138
Well, you know,
when-when you put it that way,

491
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,541
I guess maybe it's a little bit
my fault, too.

492
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,577
I missed my mom so much,

493
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:16,714
and I guess maybe I sort
of used you as a replacement.

494
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,151
I'm glad we
became friends, Evelyn.

495
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,559
(gasps, bones crack)

496
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,063
Evelyn? Evelyn?!

497
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,282
Looks like somebody's mom died
or something,

498
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:54,352
I don't know. You--You'll take
care of this, right?

499
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,155
