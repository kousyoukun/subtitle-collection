Peter, what are you doing?

13
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:38,327
I'm watching this
awesome show, Brian.

14
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:40,495
See, they took all these colors
and they're making 'em

Now the red one is sleeping
with the green one.

17
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:47,269
And the blue one thinks he's
gonna have a career in music.

18
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:49,271
And the yellow one
is just a total bitch.

19
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:51,807
Peter, that's just a channel

Peter, for God's sake,

24
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:01,116
did you eat this entire
roll of raw cookie dough?

25
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,284
Oh, is that what that was?

26
00:01:02,318 --> 00:01:03,986
I thought it was
a raisin sausage.

27
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,654
Peter, you're gonna get sick.

28
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:07,889
You can't just eat raw food
out of the fridge.

29
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:10,192
Eh, calm down,
people make mistakes.

30
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:13,228
Just look at the original design
for the first hybrid car.

31

Is it the "rapist" sign?

34
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:20,202
Yes, it is the "rapist" sign.

35
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:21,403
I quit.

36
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,242
So, as you can see,
our quarterly output is up

Okay, we'll go deeper.

Yeah, I was swindled by that cat
who said he was from the future.

106
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,381

Oh, I understand.

hundreds of deadly enemies

111
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,156
by shouting racial taunts
up at the jailhouse windows.

Oh, and another thing,

00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:31,259
raise your hand if you
think ducks are magic.

Oh...

119

00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:43,939
Peter, your mother is dead.

121
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:46,942
She had a stroke this
afternoon and she died.

122
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,410
You don't die from that, Lois.

123
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:50,512
You just host New Year's Eve

I'm so sorry.

00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:56,318
Oh, my God...

She's gone?

129
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:03,959
All right, well, I'm gonna go
confuse everyone on Facebook

130
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:07,562

Thanks, Lois.

139
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,724
I just, I just can't believe
she's really gone.

140
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,059
And I can't believe this

Thank you for coming, everyone.

143
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:52,736
We're here to celebrate
the life of Thelma Griffin.

144
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,972
Here to say a few words
about Thelma is her son, Peter.

145
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,876
My mother always hoped
to be buried

146
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:01,411
with her pet cat, Mittens,

147
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,114
so I'd like to thank
the Quahog Veterinary Society

148
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:06,016
for putting Mittens down
so quickly.

149
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,785
Yeah, just-just go ahead
and toss it in there.

150
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,954
P-Probably, probably just
stuff it in by the feet.

151
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:15,959
Okay, I will now take
questions from the audience.

152
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:18,862
No? None? They don't
have to be about my mom.

153
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:21,564
Is anyone else here watching
<i>Revolution</i> and wanting

154
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,366
to talk about it after this?

155
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:24,567
No! No! No! No!

00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:25,936
I'm not caught up!

00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:32,108
Yeah, they're stupid.

160
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,843
Thank God I'm not
going to die.

161
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:35,278
What do you mean?
Of course you are.

162
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:36,613
I'm not gonna die, Brian.

163
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,081
I'm like Jim Belushi.

164
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:40,483
I am worried about
my funny brother, though.

165
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:42,018
Food fight!

166
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,620
(groans)

167
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,823
This is tragic, but will
also open a door for me.

168
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,925
Stewie, everyone is
gonna die, at some point.

169
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,826
Everyone.

170
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,895
So like... even me?

171
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:52,896
Yes, even you.

172
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,631
You are going
to die someday, Stewie.

173
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,734
Wow... I guess you learn
something new everyday.

174
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,369
Like the Black Eyed Peas.

175
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,104
Hey, what's that?

176
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,639
This is a guitar.

177
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,174
Wow...

178
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:13,216
Oh, Peter, look,
your mom's old photo albums.

179
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,852
Oh, look at your
little baby footprints.

180
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:18,488
Yeah, my mom took my footprint
every single year.

181
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,127
When I was eight,
I was a dragon.

182
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,295
(knocking on door)

183
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:29,466
Oh, hello.
You must be Cocoon.

184
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,135
We don't have any rocks to make
you stronger here, but welcome.

185
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,269
(laughing)

186
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:34,604
You must be Peter.

187
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:36,806
I'm Evelyn, a friend
of your mother's.

188
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:38,174
Oh, oh, hi.

189
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,175
This is my family.

190
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,643
They're of no comfort.

191
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:43,279
Oh... I know it's tough
what you're going through.

192
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:47,183
You're where I was 17 years ago,
when I lost my husband, Walter.

193
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,119
He died of pancreatic cancer.

194
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:51,221
That sounds sad,
but I didn't know him.

195
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:53,156
Man, I miss my mom so much.

196
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,925
Well, I knew your mother
better than anyone.

197
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,761
I could tell you stories...

198
00:07:57,795 --> 00:07:59,562
Well, that sounds nice.

199
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,965
Peter, the two of you
should hang out together.

200
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:03,733
I'd like that very much.

201
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:06,903
Well, it's 4:00.
I'm off to bed.

202
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:09,406
Wow, Peter, looks like
you made a new friend.

203
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,574
Yeah... a-and maybe
she can be my new mom,

204
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:13,476
you know, just like Greg
Evigan and Paul Reiser

205
00:08:13,511 --> 00:08:15,311
were briefly my two dads.

206
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:16,880
I keep forgetting your names.

207
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:20,250
Can you just be "Jew Dad"
and you'll be "Earring Dad?"

208
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,196
Stewie, could you please
stop tossing and turning?

209
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,264
It's hard enough
to sleep in here

210
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,099
without my memory
foam pillow.

211
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,635
Uh... don't tell me,
don't tell me...

212
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,836
Brian!
Yep.

213
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,171
Yeah...

214
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,306
I can't go to sleep,
Brian-- I'm scared!

215
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,107
Of what?

216
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,175
Of death!

217
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,509
Well, you're not alone.

218
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:48,611
The world is full of people
who can't accept death.

219
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:49,846
And they've all got
their own ideas

220
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,181
of what happens when we die.

221
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:52,248
Really? Like what?

222
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,417
Tell me, are any of them
blindly reassuring?

223
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,652
Look, it's late.

224
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,087
We'll talk about it
first thing tomorrow.

225
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,354
Geez, you know, I gotta say,

226
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:00,723
it's weird to see you
so worked up about this.

227
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:02,125
I mean, you're
not afraid of anything.

228
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,560
Even that monster
in your closet.

229
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:05,328
Ah, he's on his way
out of here.

230
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:07,330
Ever since he violated
the section of his lease

231
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:09,499
that doesn't
allow subletters.

232
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,433
What are you talking about?

233
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,068
I don't have
anyone else in here.

234
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:14,504
Just tell him
the truth, Ethan.

235
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,007
Thank you for doing this, Brian.

236
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,109
No problem, Stewie.

237
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,911
Our first stop today
is a Jewish synagogue.

238
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:25,281
Wow, every brick in this place
is named after someone.

239
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,050
Yeah, they do that
to honor their donors.

240
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:30,086
So that side of the building
was donated by someone named,

241
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:31,421
"Get Out of Our Town"?

242
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,490
No, I-I-I think that was
the work of some

243
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:34,757
shaved-headed gentleman,

244
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,793
but, but we're here
to talk about Judaism.

245
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,728
So, where do they think
they go when they die?

246
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:40,396
Well, you should try
asking the rabbi.

247
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:42,732
Although, I should warn you,
you might not get an answer.

248
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:45,568
So, where do Jewish people
think they go when they die?

249
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:47,303
Where do you think we go?

250
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,072
Well, I don't know.
That's why I'm asking you.

251
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:51,674
Why do you think you're
asking all these questions?

252
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:53,776
I-I just, I just really
want to know what happens.

253
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:56,713
Do you think that's
part of God's infinite plan?

254
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:59,282
I think your whole religion
is a sham, just so you can get

255
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:00,950
extra holidays off from work.

256
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,485
Oop, gotta go.
It's Buchwuch.

257
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:10,760
I say, this is quite impressive.

258
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:12,962
Buddhism is an
Asian religion that also has

259
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:15,165
a significant following
of annoying white people.

260
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:15,752
Okay.

261
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:17,700
See, these guys believe
that after you die,

262
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,335
you're reincarnated
and you come back

263
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,371
as a pig or a cow
or a rooster.

264
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:22,739
Okay, okay, that's good.

265
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:24,941
I already know what noises
to make if I'm one of those.

266
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:27,055
But they also don't believe
in demonstrating emotions

267
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:28,878
either way, so they're
the worst people

268
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,446
to buy birthday gifts for.

269
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:32,515
I know you've been having
trouble getting around,

270
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,317
so I bought you a new Lexus.

271
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:36,119
And I got you
this tie clip.

272
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:38,621
Thank you both.
These are equal to me.

273
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:41,224
Screw you!
You don't even own a tie!

274
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:48,631
Now, the Catholics believe that
as long as you accept Jesus

275
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,934
before you die, anyone
can get into Heaven.

276
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:52,135
Really? Anyone?

277
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,007
I accept Jesus
as my Lord and Savior!

278
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:01,177
Yes!

279
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:08,318
Peter, thank you so much for
your help in making this cake,

280
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:09,986
but don't you think
it would be easier

281
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,387
if you stood
on the floor?

282
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,423
Yeah, but when I baked
with my mom,

283
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:15,024
I always stood
on a chair.

284
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,994
Another memory is my Uncle Roy
putting his thumb in me.

285
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:20,697
Ah, the best memories
are family memories.

286
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:23,199
Oh, hey, Evelyn,
I got a riddle for you:

287
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:25,702
What newspaper
do cows read?

288
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:27,637
The <i>Moo York Times.</i>

289
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:30,006
That's very clever, Peter.
Did you make that up?

290
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,708
Nah, I got it off
a yogurt.

291
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:33,209
Still, very impressive.

292
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:34,510
God, you know, Evelyn,

293
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:36,312
you've really helped me
through a tough time.

294
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,181
I haven't been
this grateful

295
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,049
since I met
the Sane Hatter.

296
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,252
Excuse me. How do I get back
through the looking glass?

297
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,586
Oh, yeah,
take two lefts

298
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:45,488
and it's the first
door on your right.

299
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:46,522
Cool. Great.

300
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:48,091
Thanks for not giving me
the runaround.

301
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,459
I-I asked that guy
over there,

302
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,794
but he just told me
a bunch of rhyming nonsense.

303
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:54,998
Oh, yeah-- he's, like,
a well-known dick.

304
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:01,904
What are you
still doing awake?

305
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:03,139
Changing the oil in my car!

306
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:04,741
What the hell do you think
I'm doing?!

307
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:07,577
Sorry, I stole that from the
Italian family next door.

308
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:09,312
They've been going
at it all night.

309
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:11,648
GIRL: Dad, can I have five dollars
for lunch tomorrow?

310
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:13,816
MAN: Yeah, sure, just
let me just go check

311
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:15,518
my room full
of gold and jewels.

312
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:18,955
You see, every first thing
he says is not the real thing.

313
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,057
Anyway, Brian, I'm trying
to figure out death!

314
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:23,326
It's not that
complicated, Stewie.

315
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,528
Well, which of these religions
has the right answer?

316
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:26,696
What-What about
you, Brian?

317
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,665
What do you believe
happens when you die?

318
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,667
Nothing.
Lights out. That's it.

319
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,568
That's not comforting at all!

320
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:34,370
Well, I just think
it's pretty clear

321
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,572
that we're all just bags
of bones and flesh

322
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,841
that eventually break down
and decay into worm food.

323
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:41,177
We come from nothing,
and we're gonna become nothing.

324
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:42,545
The end.
Night, Stewie.

325
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:46,049
Lights out.

326
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,017
Did you hear him, Rupert?

327
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:50,019
Life is just a big joke.

328
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:52,455
It's just sitting
around waiting to die.

329
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,123
Well, I can't live like that.

330
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:55,458
I'd rather just end it.

331
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,093
I'm going to take my own life.

332
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,696
But first, I'm gonna play ball
in the house.

333
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,899
(gasps)
Parents are right!

334
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:09,939
ANNOUNCER: We now return to
<i>S.T., the Special Terrestrial.</i>

335
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,978
Hi!

336
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:17,347
Hey, guys,
this is Evelyn.

337
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,048
She's the one
with that bathroom carpet

338
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,184
I've been peeing on
I told you about.

339
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,552
Hey, nice to meet you.

340
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:24,721
You know, instead
of drawing on your eyebrows,

341
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:26,522
maybe just go without
eyebrows.

342
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,092
And I'm Joe Swanson.

343
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,361
I've been dying to introduce
you guys to Evelyn.

344
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,196
We've just been having
the best time together.

345
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,630
Evelyn, tell them
how many sodas

346
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,165
I combined at the movie theater.
Two.

347
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,468
It was more than that.
She fell asleep.

348
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:42,138
She let me drive
a little bit on the way home.

349
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,539
Just in the parking lot.

350
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,708
But you were a good
little navigator.

351
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,380
Yeah, I just remembered, I gotta
get the hell out of here.

352
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,619
Well, God said I could
walk just one time.

353
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:59,789
I was saving it for
Susie's wedding day, but...

354
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,761
Your friends seem lovely.

355
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:06,095
Ah, they a'ight.

356
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,132
You know, Evelyn, I am having
such a good time with you.

357
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,967
You're like
my aboveground mom.

358
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,236
Oh, Peter, you know, sometimes

359
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,138
I think your mother
brought us together.

360
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:16,806
Yeah, tha-that's how I feel.

361
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,007
Good.

362
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:22,545
(whimpering)

363
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,885
<i>(The Price Is Right</i>
theme plays)

364
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,988
Come on. Are you molesting me
or watching TV?

365
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:39,132
I can't believe that
old woman kissed you!

366
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,400
Oh, it was horrible, Lois.

367
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:42,636
There were still crumbs
in the corners of her mouth

368
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,339
from that Nilla Wafer
she had at lunch.

369
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:47,574
Are you sure there wasn't
some kind of misunderstanding?

370
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:49,343
No, no, those were
definitely Nilla Wafers.

371
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:51,345
And it really
bums me out, you know,

372
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:53,613
'cause I thought she was
something special.

373
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:55,482
She was like a mom to me.

374
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:57,718
Well, then you should
go talk to her

375
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,286
and try to clear
this up.

376
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,688
It sounds weird, but
maybe it was innocent.

377
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,523
I mean, this wouldn't
be the first time

378
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:05,258
you thought someone
was hitting on you.

379
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,394
Would you like
to add chips and a drink?

380
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:09,196
Here we go again.

381
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:16,303
All right, Rupert, here we go.

382
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,176
Well, I'm not dead,
but I do have a boner.

383
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:26,346
So that is something new
about Stewie.

384
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:31,084
Okay, death by cop.

385
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:35,288
Hey, copper, come get me!

386
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:37,257
(flatly):
Oh, no, an armed assailant!

387
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,493
I definitely don't want
to die today.

388
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:42,662
I have so much
to live for.

389
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:44,131
Come on! Shoot me!

390
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:46,967
The one day I don't wear
my bulletproof vest!

391
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,102
What are you waiting for?
I'm wide open!

392
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:51,638
Don't you hate how the heart
is right about here?

393
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:54,040
Just kiss, you fruitcakes!

394
00:15:58,012 --> 00:16:01,047
All right, Rupert, the old
toaster in the tub never fails.

395
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,383
(gasping, shuddering)

396
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:10,991
Oh, damn, I wanted to die,
not turn into Toaster Man.

397
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:15,662
I don't know
about this Toaster Man.

398
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:18,331
While he's getting all the
glory, John Q. Taxpayer is left

399
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,733
to clean up the crumbs.

400
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,134
(zap)

401
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:24,304
(gasps) My breakfast bread
just got perfectly browned!

402
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:26,473
I just wish I could thank him!

403
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,141
Oh, I think he knows, Pop.

404
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:30,577
I think he knows.

405
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,249
Evelyn, we need to talk.

406
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,985
Oh, Peter,
I owe you an apology.

407
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,088
I'm afraid my new medicine
made me act foolishly yesterday.

408
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:44,191
You must forgive me.
Oh.

409
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:47,260
So it-it was, it was
just your medicine, huh?

410
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,296
Well, I guess I can
understand that.

411
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,131
You know, I'm addicted
to nasal spray.

412
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:55,735
I smell everything!
I'm invincible!

413
00:16:58,172 --> 00:16:59,506
(panting)

414
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,575
I'm probably gonna be
a little down

415
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:03,577
until I use
the spray again.

416
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:05,779
That's okay, Peter.
Now come along.

417
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:08,748
I've got quite the day
planned for us.

418
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:11,818
♪ She's just a devil woman

419
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,753
♪ With evil on her mind

420
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:16,156
♪ Beware the devil woman

421
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,158
♪ She's gonna get you

422
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:20,026
♪ She's just a devil woman

423
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:22,262
♪ With evil on her mind

424
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:23,763
♪ Beware the devil woman

425
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:26,299
♪ She's gonna get you
from behind. ♪

426
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,776
Evelyn, I think it's best

427
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,678
that we don't see
each other anymore.

428
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:39,779
But Peter...

429
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:41,181
No, Evelyn, I trusted you,

430
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:42,949
and all this funny business
keeps happening,

431
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:44,918
and I don't think
it's your medicine at all.

432
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:47,020
So I'm afraid this is good-bye.

433
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:49,523
But Peter, I thought
we were friends.

434
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,258
Yeah, right.
You tricked me!

435
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,860
You're as bad as those
predators on the Internet.

436
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:55,462
That's wild, Stacey.

437
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:58,465
I'm a 12-year-old girl, too.

438
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,567
My name's Jenny.

439
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:04,104
Want to come over to my place
and help me move?

440
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:05,772
(doorbell rings)

441
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:08,675
Hey, you're not
a 12-year-old girl!

442
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:10,777
Neither are you, Jenny!

443
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:13,380
Huh. I guess we aren't
so different after all.

444
00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:15,549
Yeah. You know, this isn't
a whole lot of stuff.

445
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,884
We can probably knock
this out in an hour.

446
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:27,460
What the hell?!

447
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:30,230
Stewie, what the hell
are you doing?!

448
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:33,166
MAN: He's doing his taxes!
What's it look like he's doing?

449
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,335
WOMAN: Vito, get away from
the neighbors' house!

450
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:36,670
I'm killing myself,
Brian.

451
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:38,338
You said it yourself,
when we die,

452
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,507
there's nothing!
We just rot in the ground!

453
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,775
Well, if life has
no purpose,

454
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:43,410
why not just cut
to the chase?

455
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:44,878
Look, Stewie, I know
you're worried,

456
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:47,314
but you can't live your life
being scared of death.

457
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:48,815
Nobody knows
what comes next,

458
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,384
so all we can do is pack
the most we can

459
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:52,752
into each day we've got.

460
00:18:52,787 --> 00:18:54,287
So for you,
that's taking

461
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:56,790
a 45-minute shaky-leg poop
on the front lawn?

462
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:57,991
I'm just saying
there's something

463
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,826
to be said for living
in the moment.

464
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,328
So what you're saying is

465
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:03,229
I've got to find
<i>my</i> shaky-leg poop.

466
00:19:03,264 --> 00:19:05,031
Exactly.

467
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:06,499
Well, I-I have
always wanted

468
00:19:06,534 --> 00:19:08,535
to be a singer-songwriter.

469
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:11,071
Um... yeah. No, yeah,
you could do that.

470
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:12,372
You-You paused.

471
00:19:12,406 --> 00:19:13,540
Why-Why did you pause?

472
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:15,442
Uh... no reason.

473
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,444
You did it again!
I swear to God,

474
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:19,412
I will throw myself
right out that window!

475
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,915
Okay, welcome
to the Apple Tree Pub.

476
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:24,284
I'm Stewie Griffin,
and these...

477
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:26,953
are my six assistants.

478
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,321
You know,
I changed my mind.

479
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:29,856
Kill yourself.

480
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:36,663
Hey, Mom, I-I gotta talk
to you about something.

481
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,798
You know, ever since
you turned into a rock

482
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,133
with your name on it,

483
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:43,169
your friend's been
really inappropriate with me.

484
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:45,138
Hello, Peter.

485
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,272
Oh. Hi.

486
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:48,108
What are you doing here?

487
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,976
Peter, I want
to apologize.

488
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:52,445
I <i>did</i> behave
inappropriately.

489
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,581
It's just that since my beloved
Walter died,

490
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:57,617
you're the first man who's paid
any attention to me,

491
00:19:57,652 --> 00:20:00,654
and I guess I took advantage
of that.

492
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:02,122
Huh.

493
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:04,724
Well, you know, when-when
you put it that way,

494
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,061
I guess maybe it's a little bit
my fault, too.

495
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:10,163
I missed my mom so much,

496
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:14,300
and I guess maybe I sort of
used you as a replacement.

497
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:17,504
I'm glad we
became friends, Evelyn.

498
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:25,879
(bones crack)

499
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:29,382
Evelyn? Evelyn?!

500
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:48,722
Looks like somebody's mom died
or something,

501
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:51,276
I don't know. You--You'll take
care of this, right?

502
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:56,277
