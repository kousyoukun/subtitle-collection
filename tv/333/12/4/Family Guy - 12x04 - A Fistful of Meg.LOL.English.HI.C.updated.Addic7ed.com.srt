<i>Gracias.</i>
What are my powers?

16
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:45,952
Oh, yeah. It's weird.

17
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:48,287
You're, like, really good
at painting my living room.

18
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:50,289
Up, up, and get it done
by Saturday.

19
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:51,758
We're having a party.

20
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:53,826
Hey, Brian. Can you come
in here a sec?

21
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:55,294
Sure, Peter,
what's up?

22
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,696
You're a well-read guy, right?

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,032
Well, I don't know. I guess
when I read my Henry David,

24
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,633
I tend to be
pretty Thoreau.

STEWIE: Shut up!
Yeah, 'cause, you see,

26
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:04,037
I been reading this
novel about three guys,

27
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:05,238
happen to be pigs, uh,

28
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,106
that decide to
build their own houses.

29
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:09,575
So, now, one of 'em builds
his house out of straws.

30
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,978
Right? Now, how the hell do
you build a house out of straws?

31
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:13,713
And-and three pigs
living together?

Gay. You know?
And so's the wolf.

33
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:17,950
He's chasing pigs and
blowing everything in sight.

34
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:19,352
Peter,
what are you doing?

35
00:01:19,386 --> 00:01:21,421
I'm just getting ready for bed.
What's wrong?

36
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:23,956
You're-you're naked.
I'm-I'm right here.

37
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:25,358
Who cares? You're my dog.

38
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:27,093
Everybody gets naked
in front of their dog.

39
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:28,428
Besides, you're always naked,

40
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:30,763
except for when Lois dresses
you up in that rain gear.

41
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:32,432
Okay, everyone
in the car!

42
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:34,300
We're going
to Martha's Vineyard!

43
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:36,736
Do I have to wear this on the ferry?
Yes, you do.

44
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,104
What about Peter?

45
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:39,605
Why-why doesn't he
have to wear this crap?

46

Peter's
in his crate.

47
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,608
I'm actually relieved.

48
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:44,777
The ferry would be
overstimulating.

Hey, Megan.
Oh, hey, guys.

52
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:57,824
Wait, did you
just call me Megan?

53
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:59,092
That's your name, isn't it?

54
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:01,627
Actually, "Meg" is short
for something else.

55
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:03,463
Peter, would you give this
to the nurse?

56
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:04,831

He's a complete psycho.

65
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,584
I heard he knifed a kid
on the playground,

66
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:26,052
then beat up the knife.

67

I heard he can watch <i>Friday</i>

You're very judgmental
lately.

74
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:50,409
I don't like this Brandon.

Well, I heard about how Peter's
making you see him naked lately,

150
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:17,070
so I thought the only way to get
even is for you to see me naked.

Yeah.

00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:40,460
PRINCIPAL SHEPHERD:
Good morning, students.

160
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:42,963
This is Principal Shepherd
with the morning announcements.

161
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:45,966
Remember that all wagers on
Friday's Meg Griffin slaughter

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,368
must be on my desk by Thursday.

163
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:51,238
Also, Zack Morris,
if you could stop freezing time

164
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:54,107
to talk to the camera,
the day would go a lot faster.

165
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:55,909
Oh, my God, you guys,
what am I gonna do?

166
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,845
That psycho
is going to kill me.

167
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,047
Meg, you've got to find a way
out of this fight.

168
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,716
Yeah, Meg. You can do it.
You're a smart woman,

169
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,718
and women can do
anything nowadays.

170
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:05,919
I guess you're right.

171
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:08,121
It's not
like it's the 1950s.

172
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:10,090
So I see you graduated number one

173
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:12,159
in your class from Princeton.
That's right.

174
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:15,162
And I'm certified as an accountant and
also have a law degree.

175
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:16,763
That's all very impressive.

176
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:19,032
We'll keep you in mind.

177
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:22,369
Let's see, Pointy Boobs,
Medium-Pointy Boobs,

178
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:24,771
Not-So-Pointy Boobs.

179
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:26,773
That's a shame.

180
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:33,680
Hey, Mom, I need to transfer
to a different school.

181
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:36,884
Meg, we've been over this.
Just because a Facebook page

182
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:40,053
has over 2,000 likes doesn't
mean you have to kill yourself.

183
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,222
I-It's not that.
Mom, please?

184
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:43,490
There's other schools.

185
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:46,093
Carlisle Academy leads the state
in teen pregnancies.

186
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,262
So... I might
meet somebody.

187
00:07:48,296 --> 00:07:50,430
Meg, Carlisle Academy's
a private school.

188
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:51,765
We can't afford it.

189
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,901
Don't you remember how much
money your father wasted

190
00:07:53,935 --> 00:07:56,870
so he could make grand
staircase entrances?

191
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:58,605
(doorbell rings)

192
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,007
Hey, is Peter here?

193
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,341
(sighs)
Hang on.

194
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:02,442
Peter!

195
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:04,177
(Southern accent):
Why, Glenn Quagmire.

196
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:06,680
It's been 10 years
if it's been a day.

197
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:08,715
(grand orchestral theme plays)

198
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:16,089
I figured out how to get out
of this fight.

199
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:18,258
All I have to do
is get expelled.

200
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,794
That sex tape I released
should be everywhere by now,

201
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:23,330
and then they'll have
to kick me out of the school.

202
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:28,568
Come on! Really?

203
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:29,836
(beep)

204
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,204
(gasps)
Ooh.

205
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,008
You know what?

206
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:36,376
Good for her.

207
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:42,549
Hey, guys, you four
are pretty much

208
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,951
the toughest guys
in school, right?

209
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:46,553
What would it take to get
you to beat up Mike Pulaski?

210
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:48,622
Mental Mike?
Are you kidding?

211
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,624
Come on, guys,
I'll do anything.

212
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:52,559
I-I'll give you
a Swallow Friday.

213
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:54,227
You mean
a Follow Friday?

214
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:55,629
Oh...

215
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:57,564
I've been doing
Twitter all wrong.

216
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:59,733
Okay, okay.
I-I'll just pay you.

217
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,735
Oh, yeah? Well,
you're looking at 1,000 bucks

218
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,003
for something like that.

219
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:05,005
$1,000? All right.

220
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,407
But it's gonna be hard
to get that kind of money.

221
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,676
I mean, I'm not Judge Judy.

222
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:11,345
Hi, I'm Judge Judy.

223
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:15,349
I get paid $45 million a year to
yell at people who have nothing.

224
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:18,752
Now here's an ad about
a fat-people disease you have.

225
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:26,593
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to <i>B.E.T. E.T.</i>

226
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:28,729
Don't you need
to phone home?

227
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:31,064
Nah, I do it later.

228
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:32,399
(doorbell rings)

229
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:35,268
Brian Griffin?

230
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:36,436
Uh, yeah, that's me.

231
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:37,471
Here you go.

232
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:41,541
Aah! Oh, God!

233
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:43,610
(laughs) What's in the
box, Brian?

234
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:45,946
(laughs)
I got you good!

235
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,348
I don't feel right.
I want it back.

236
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:54,421
What's going on?

237
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:56,089
Did that kid from
the future come back?

238
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:57,924
(gasps)

239
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,564
Oh, no!

240
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,966
(crying)

241
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:09,703
Meg, are you okay?

242
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:12,639
(sniffles) You guys, I've tried
everything, but it's hopeless!

243
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:14,107
He's going to kill me.

244
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:16,910
I can already
picture my funeral.

245
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:18,412
(bagpipes playing)

246
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:22,749
Thanks. Didn't want
to pay for the hole.

247
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,484
This is such
a nightmare!

248
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,286
At least I
have you guys.

249
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,155
I don't know what I
would do without you.

250
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:29,923
Yeah, uh, about that.

251
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:32,159
Listen, Meg,
we decided that maybe it's best

252
00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:33,827
if you don't talk to us anymore.

253
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:35,829
Yeah, we could be
targeted by association.

254
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:37,898
I don't want to get
beaten up by a guy

255
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:39,800
unless it's in a limo
after prom.

256
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:43,103
So you're all gonna ditch me
when I need you most?

257
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:44,704
Yeah, Meg,
it's natural selection.

258
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:46,540
This is how it works
in the wild.

259
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:48,375
Hey. Hey, how you doing?
Hey there.

260
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:50,077
Hey. Nice spot, huh?
Oh, yeah.

261
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:51,311
Oh, yeah, it's great.

262
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:53,113
Especially 'cause of
that thing over there.

263
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:55,115
You know what's in there? Corn.

264
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,151
Really? Wow.
I could go for some corn.

265
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:00,253
(crackling)

266
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:01,588
(laughs)

267
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:02,923
You're dark, Rog.

268
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:04,291
I don't care.

269
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:05,592
Good luck, Meg.

270
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:08,061
Now we must retreat
into the shadows.

271
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,097
(wind whistling,
bell tinkling)

272
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:14,267
(cries)
What am I gonna do?

273
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:16,870
QUAGMIRE: Sounds like you have
a pretty big problem, Meg.

274
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:18,105
Huh?

275
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:21,508
Mr. Quagmire?

276
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,943
What are you doing in here?

277
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,611
This is my base
of operations.

278
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:25,645
WOMAN (over intercom):
Mr. Quagmire,

279
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,913
the girls' gym class

280
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:28,582
will be in the showers
in 20 minutes.

281
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:29,749
Thank you, Shirley.

282
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:31,284
She's been with
me 12 years.

283
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:32,452
It's her birthday today.

284
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:34,020
Didn't get her anything.
(groans)

285
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:36,256
So, I guess you heard
about the fight, huh?

286
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,892
Oh, yeah, they're talking about
it in all the girls' bathrooms.

287
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:40,060
I'm so dead.

288
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:41,361
No, you're not,

289
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:43,463
because I'm gonna help you
defeat Mike Pulaski.

290
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:44,464
You are?

291
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:45,632
That's right.

292
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,800
Be at my house first
thing tomorrow morning,

293
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:47,968
and we'll get started.

294
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:49,903
Wow, thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

295
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:52,272
Well, I better get home.

296
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:55,742
(horns tooting
and whistles blowing)

297
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:58,078
What a good way
to get around town.

298
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:05,486
Okay, Meg, you've got a bully
problem, and I'm gonna help you.

299
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:07,855
But Mr. Quagmire,
why would you want to help me?

300
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,824
Because I was once
in your shoes, Meg.

301
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:12,593
I wasn't always the confident
guy you see before you.

302
00:12:12,628 --> 00:12:15,596
You see, I, too,
was terrorized by a bully.

303
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:19,701
It was 1986, and the cola wars
were at a frenzy.

304
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:22,804
<i>I was sitting in the RC section</i>
<i>of the cafeteria</i>

305
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:24,505
<i>when Tracy Bellings approached.</i>

306
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,141
Why aren't you drinking
Coke, you dork?

307
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:28,910
Pepsi would also
be acceptable!

308
00:12:28,944 --> 00:12:31,079
It doesn't have
to be a two-cola system!

309
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:33,848
RC is what keeps the big guys
on their toes!

310
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,917
You know what "RC"
stands for, don't you?

311
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,218
"Chicks Rule!"

312
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:38,619
QUAGMIRE:

313
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:39,921
<i>Anyway, that was the beginning</i>

314
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,923

315
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:44,292
<i>It's one thing if you put</i>
<i>your penis inside-out</i>

316
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:45,927
<i>in the safety</i>
<i>of your own bedroom,</i>

317
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:48,096
<i>but to have it done</i>
<i>in the cafeteria...</i>

318
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,498
<i>To this day,</i>
<i>I can't have sex with a woman</i>

319
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:53,234
<i>against her will</i>
<i>without thinking about rape.</i>

320
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:55,103
And that's
why I'm gonna help you, Meg.

321
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:56,471
I never faced my bully.

322
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:58,339
I don't want you
to make the same mistake.

323
00:12:58,374 --> 00:12:59,407
But how?

324
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:00,641
Over the years,

325
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:02,543
I've tested the limits
of the human body.

326
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:05,213
How much it can stuff in,
swallow or choke on.

327
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:06,714
How a scrotum can be stretched

328
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:09,150
into a makeshift sail
if stranded at sea.

329
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:11,586
All this knowledge is gonna
help you win your fight.

330
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,020
Oh, thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

331
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:14,956
I'll take any help I can get.

332
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,257
I haven't been this scared

333
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,426
since my dad stopped showering
for six months.

334
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,961
Great meatloaf, Mom.

335
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:21,429
Thanks, honey.

336
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:22,764
PETER:
Hungry!

337
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:24,132
(flies buzzing)
Hungry!

338
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,967
Pour food on my pile!

339
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:28,069
Okay, Peter, here you go.

340
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:30,371
Mmm. I will assimilate
this new smell

341
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:33,541
into the larger Borg
of my smells.

342
00:13:38,347 --> 00:13:39,914
Oh, by the way,
Rupert, good news.

343
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:41,582
I pooped out your bow tie.

344
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:42,817
(gasps):
Gaah!

345
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,085
Geez, what the hell, Brian?!

346
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,253
I can't take it anymore!

347
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:46,421
(knocking on door)

348
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:47,688
PETER:
Message for Brian Griffin!

349
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:49,724
(groaning)

350
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:52,360
(grunts)

351
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:54,629
I lost my ass gambling.
Have you seen it?

352
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:55,997
Leave me alone, you jerk!

353
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:57,331
Stewie, you got to help me.

354
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,033
Peter just won't let up
with the nudity.

355
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:00,735
Well, you know how
the fat man operates.

356
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:02,470
He won't stop
unless he's stopped.

357
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:04,071
The only way
you're going to end this is

358
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:05,940
if you find a way
to even the score.

359
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:07,442
You've got to be nude.

360
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:08,543
Stewie, I <i>am</i> nude.

361
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:09,710
I'm just covered with fur.

362
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:10,878
Well, shave it off.

363
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:12,079
Give him a taste
of his own medicine.

364
00:14:12,114 --> 00:14:13,381
Maybe you're right.

365
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:14,882
I mean, I got to do something.

366
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:16,918
This is just one of those things
he won't let up with.

367
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:19,787
Like when he was guest hosting
<i>Inside the Actor's Studio.</i>

368
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:22,623
Jeff Daniels, what
is your favorite Care Bear?

369
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:26,227
I, uh, uh... I don't know
any of the Care Bears.

370
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:29,530
Right, but if you had to pick
one, who would be your favorite?

371
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,399
Well, like I said,
I'm not really familiar..

372
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:34,001
You can just say the color.
I know all the Care Bears.

373
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:35,670
I... I don't know.
The blue one.

374
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:36,938
There's, like,
11 blue ones, Jeff.

375
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:38,272
Are you here to dick around,

376
00:14:38,307 --> 00:14:40,174
or you want to do
<i>Inside the Actor's Studio?</i>

377
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:45,680
All right, Meg, the best way
for you to focus your rage is

378
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:47,315
if I wear the
mask of the person

379
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:49,083
who's bullied you
every day of your life.

380
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:50,818
Now, when I give the word,

381
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:52,854
I want you to come at me
with everything you got.

382
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:54,589
Oh, hey, Meg.
Hey, Peter.

383
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:57,291
You know, Peter,
I'm glad I ran into you.

384
00:14:57,326 --> 00:14:59,427
We really need
to talk about Quagmire.

385
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:01,062
You got time for a beer?

386
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:04,899
I don't know.
He's just so needy.

387
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:07,235
And I feel like he's
jealous of our friendship.

388
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:08,836
You all right, Peter?

389
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:10,638
You seem a little
quiet today.

390
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:12,240
I'm fine!
Oh, okay, good.

391
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:13,541
Hey, Peter.
Hey, Joe.

392
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,042
I'm glad
you guys are here.

393
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:17,077
I've got terrible,
gross medical news for Quagmire.

394
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,247
Maybe you can help me
break it to him.

395
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:22,717
Mr. Quagmire,
how am I supposed

396
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:24,318
to beat a guy
like Mike Pulaski?

397
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:25,586
He's massive!

398
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,421
He may be stronger
than you, but you're grosser.

399
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:28,656
And you're gonna use that.

400
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,591
Your weird body can be
a dangerous weapon

401
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:32,193
if used properly.
Okay.

402
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:34,388
Now, did you ever play
old-school Nintendo?

403
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:34,829
No.

404
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,164
Well, then what we're about
to do may seem strange,

405
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,399
but just go with it.

406
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:40,434
(upbeat synthesizer
video game music plays)

407
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,640
(electronic voice):

408
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:50,211
Now, Meg, in order
to get you into fighting shape,

409
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:52,446
I want you to drink
this glass of raw eggs.

410
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:53,814
I don't see any yolks.

411
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,316
Just drink it.

412
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:00,021
(phone ringing)

413
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:01,422
BRIAN:
Hello?

414
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:02,690
Cynthia!

415
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:04,692
Oh, my God! So good
to hear from you!

416
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:06,928
(door squeaks)
Sure, I can talk.

417
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:09,063
I'm just sitting
out here in the open.

418
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:12,934
(snickering)

419
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,702
My car? It's a Prius.
(chuckles)

420
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:17,371
I wouldn't say I'm specifically
a hero for driving one.

421
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:19,941
The heroes are the ones
who come back from Iraq

422
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:21,208
and drive a Prius.

423
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:22,109
Gotcha!

424
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:23,477
(click)

425
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:25,246
Wha... what the hell?!

426
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,547
BRIAN:
Hey!

427
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:27,815
You looking for me?

428
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:31,986
Oh, God,
what the hell is that?!

429
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,387
What's wrong?
You look uncomfortable.

430
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:35,122
Here, let me give you a hug.

431
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:37,224
Aah! Get away from me,
you gremlin!

432
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:40,962
(whimpering)

433
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:42,863
Aah! No!

434
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:44,899
Why don't you rub
my belly, pal?!

435
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:49,604
(whimpering, wailing)

436
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:52,139
Your skin is so loose
and wrinkly!

437
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,075
It's like I'm just
pushing around

438
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:56,410
a plastic bag full
of chicken bones!

439
00:16:56,445 --> 00:16:59,614
Ugh! Why do you have
so many nipples?

440
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:02,650
You gonna put your clothes on?!
Yes! Yes! I swear!

441
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:04,485
You gonna keep 'em on?!
Yes, I promise!

442
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,787
I'll never bother you
again with my body!

443
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:09,123
(crying):
Please, just make this stop!

444
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:10,291
Good.

445
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:12,259
Dad, can you give me
a ride to the... ?

446
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:13,427
(screams)

447
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:14,729
What is that thing?!

448
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:16,263
Aah! Make it go away!
(whimpering)

449
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:18,232
What's going on in here?
(Peter whimpers, Chris cries

450
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:19,967
Oh, my God,
is that a (bleep) rat?!

451
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:22,503
Peter, hold it down,
I'm getting the gun!

452
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:27,642
(clock ticking)

453
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:30,645
(bell rings,
students converse indistinctly)

454
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,481
Hey, who you taking
to Meg's funeral?

455
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:34,749
I'm taking
Jill.

456
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:36,384
Ooh!

457
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:38,786
Wise guy, we're going
as friends.

458
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,788
(crowd cheering)

459
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,097
All right, Meg, remember
what I taught you.

460
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:52,066
Relax my throat
and make eye contact?

461
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,334
No, no,
the fighting stuff.

462
00:17:57,072 --> 00:18:00,241
Um, listen, before we start,
could you not hit me here

463
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:02,410
because these are pretty
sensitive? (groans)

464
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:03,678
(cheering)

465
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:10,851
He punched her pretty!

466
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,155
(crowd groans)
Oh, he punched her ugly again.

467
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:15,322
ALL:
Ah!

468
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:16,490
ALL:
Aw!

469
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:17,658
ALL:
Ah!

470
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:18,859
ALL:
Aw!

471
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:20,027
ALL:
Ah!

472
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:21,395
BOY:
Just stop there!

473
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,830
ALL:
Aw!

474
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,331
Punch Rocky Dennis!

475
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:25,766
It's okay, guys.

476
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:27,601
I'm at peace
with what I'm all about.

477
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:29,437
(applause)

478
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:34,875
(cheering)

479
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:40,614
Meg, remember
what I taught you.

480
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:42,283
Use the gross.

481
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:44,318
(crowd cheering)

482
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:48,155
You ready for more?

483
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,558
Are <i>you?!</i>

484
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:52,293
(all gasping)

485
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:53,561
Ugh!

486
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:55,730
Your kiss is definitely
not on my list!

487
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:56,797
He's older.

488
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:00,201
(laughs)
You missed!

489
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:01,435
Oh, what's the matter, Mike?

490
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,304
Can't punch a girl
in the face?

491
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:06,440
You'd be surprised
what my face can do to you!

492
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:09,210
(all groaning)

493
00:19:12,147 --> 00:19:14,215
Ugh! What's your
problem, dude?!

494
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:15,883
You've got major issues!

495
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,418
Oh, my God, she's crazy!

496
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:20,321
Did you hear the volleyball
team lost in San Diego?

497
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:24,258
All right, you little bitch,
it's time to end this thing!

498
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:26,293
Yeah, it is!

499
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:29,096
(yelling)

500
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,875
Oh, my gosh!
Meg won!

501
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,443
(cheering)

502
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:48,682
Huh, not bad for a loser.

503
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:50,551
Thanks for your help,
Mr. Quagmire.

504
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:52,653
I guess I get
to die another day.

505
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:54,121
Meg, I got a feeling

506
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:56,423
you're gonna be around
for a real long time.

507
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,993
Come on, let's
get out of here.

508
00:19:59,027 --> 00:20:01,662
MEG: <i>But I</i> wasn't <i>around</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

509
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:04,265
<i>A year later, my body reacted</i>
<i>to a frozen hot dog,</i>

510
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:05,833
<i>and I died of septic shock.</i>

511
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:09,170
<i>I became the public face</i>
<i>of internal hot dog defrosting.</i>

512
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:19,013
(groaning)
Cold.

513
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:20,181
Well, it worked.

514
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:21,482
Thanks for your help, Stewie.

515
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:23,651
If I knew you were
actually gonna do it,

516
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:25,085
I wouldn't have
suggested it.

517
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,289
You look like my foot that time
Lois made my bath too hot.

518
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:29,657
Come on! It's not that bad.

519
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:31,559
My fur will grow back
in about three months.

520
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:33,194
Well, I can't look at
this for three months,

521
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:34,495
so I've come up
with a solution.

522
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:36,530
Put these on.

523
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:41,368
Stewie, I...
Hold still.

524
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:43,404
(marker squeaking)

525
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:46,674
There you go.

526
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,625
You look good.
You look <i>really</i> good.

527
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:53,239
Hi, Stewie, and...
(gasps) Stewie?!

528
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,080
This is next week's story.
Get there.
