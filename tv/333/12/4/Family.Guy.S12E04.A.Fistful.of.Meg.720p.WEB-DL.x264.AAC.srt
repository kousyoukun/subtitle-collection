You're, like, really good
at painting my living room.

Up, up, and get it done

Hey, Brian. Can you come
in here a sec?

19
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,687
Sure, Peter,
what's up?

20
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,089
You're a well-read guy, right?

21
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,425
Well, I don't know. I guess
when I read my Henry David,

Shut up!

I been reading this
novel about three guys,

25
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,664
happen to be pigs, uh,

26
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,499
that decide to build
their own houses.

27
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,002
So, now, one of 'em builds
his house out of straws.

28
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,371
Right? Now, how the hell do
you build a house out of straws?

And-and three pigs

And so's the wolf.

31

He's chasing pigs and
blowing everything in sight.

32

Peter,
what are you doing?

33
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,847
I'm just getting ready for bed.
What's wrong?

34
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,349
You're-you're naked.
I'm-I'm right here.

35
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,751
Who cares? You're my dog.

36
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,519
Everybody gets naked
in front of their dog.

37
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,921
Besides, you're always naked,

38
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,190
except for when Lois dresses
you up in that rain gear.

39

Okay, everyone
in the car!

41
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,129
Do I have to wear
this on the ferry?
Yes, you do.

42
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,530
What about Peter?

43
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,032
Why-why doesn't he
have to wear this crap?

44

Peter's
in his crate.

45
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,035
I'm actually relieved.

46
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,204
The ferry would be
overstimulating.

Hey, Megan.
Oh, hey, guys.

Wait, did you
just call me Megan?

51
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,485
That's your name, isn't it?

52
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,954
Actually, "Meg" is short
for something else.

53
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,889
Peter, would you give this
to the nurse?

I heard he knifed a kid
on the playground,

then beat up the knife.

to talk to the camera,
the day would go a lot faster.

160
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,682
Oh, my God, you guys,
what am I gonna do?

161
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,618
That psycho
is going to kill me.

162
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,753
Meg, you've got to find a way
out of this fight.

163
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,523
Yeah, Meg. You can do it.
You're a smart woman,

164
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,525
and women can do
anything nowadays.

165
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,692
I guess you're right.

166
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,895
It's not
like it's the 1950s.

167
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,897
So I see you graduated
number one

168
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,965
in your class
from Princeton.
That's right.

169
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,968
And I'm certified
as an accountant and
also have a law degree.

170
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,570
That's all very impressive.

171
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,872
We'll keep you in mind.

172
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,209
Let's see, Pointy Boobs,
Medium-Pointy Boobs,

173
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,578
Not-So-Pointy Boobs.

174
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,613
That's a shame.

175
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:36,487
Hey, Mom, I need to transfer
to a different school.

176
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,723
Meg, we've been over this.
Just because a Facebook page

177
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,893
has over 2,000 likes doesn't
mean you have to kill yourself.

178
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,062
I-It's not that.
Mom, please?

179
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,397
There's other schools.

180
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,899
Carlisle Academy leads the state
in teen pregnancies.

181
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,068
So... I might
meet somebody.

182
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,237
Meg, Carlisle Academy's
a private school.

183
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,605
We can't afford it.

184
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,740
Don't you remember how much
money your father wasted

185
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,677
so he could make grand
staircase entrances?

186
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,412
(doorbell rings)

187
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,746
Hey, is Peter here?

188
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,148
(sighs)
Hang on.

189
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,249
Peter!

190
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,984
(Southern accent):
Why, Glenn Quagmire.

191
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,487
It's been 10 years
if it's been a day.

192
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,555
(grand orchestral theme plays)

193
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:18,929
I figured out how to get out
of this fight.

194
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,098
All I have to do
is get expelled.

195
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,601
That sex tape I released
should be everywhere by now,

196
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,170
and then they'll have
to kick me out of the school.

197
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:31,375
Come on! Really?

198
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,643
(beep)

199
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,044
(gasps)
Ooh.

200
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:37,815
You know what?

201
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,216
Good for her.

202
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,356
Hey, guys, you four
are pretty much

203
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,790
the toughest guys
in school, right?

204
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,360
What would it take to get
you to beat up Mike Pulaski?

205
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,462
Mental Mike?
Are you kidding?

206
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,464
Come on, guys,
I'll do anything.

207
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,366
I-I'll give you
a Swallow Friday.

208
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,034
You mean
a Follow Friday?

209
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,469
Oh...

210
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,371
I've been doing
Twitter all wrong.

211
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,473
Okay, okay.
I-I'll just pay you.

212
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,542
Oh, yeah? Well,
you're looking at 1,000 bucks

213
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,809
for something like that.

214
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,811
$1,000? All right.

215
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,214
But it's gonna be hard
to get that kind of money.

216
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,483
I mean, I'm not Judge Judy.

217
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,151
Hi, I'm Judge Judy.

218
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:18,155
I get paid $45 million a year to
yell at people who have nothing.

219
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,592
Now here's an ad about
a fat-people disease you have.

220
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:29,400
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to <i>B.E.T. E.T.</i>

221
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,535
Don't you need
to phone home?

222
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,871
Nah, I do it later.

223
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,239
(doorbell rings)

224
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,075
Brian Griffin?

225
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,243
Uh, yeah, that's me.

226
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,311
Here you go.

227
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:44,348
Aah! Oh, God!

228
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,417
(laughs)
What's in the
box, Brian?

229
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,752
(laughs)
I got you good!

230
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,188
I don't feel right.
I want it back.

231
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:57,227
What's going on?

232
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,896
Did that kid from
the future come back?

233
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,764
(gasps)

234
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,371
Oh, no!

235
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,806
(crying)

236
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:12,543
Meg, are you okay?

237
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,446
(sniffles) You guys, I've tried
everything, but it's hopeless!

238
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,914
He's going to kill me.

239
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,717
I can already
picture my funeral.

240
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,285
(bagpipes playing)

241
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,556
Thanks. Didn't want
to pay for the hole.

242
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,291
This is such
a nightmare!

243
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,093
At least I
have you guys.

244
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,961
I don't know what I
would do without you.

245
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,730
Yeah, uh, about that.

246
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,965
Listen, Meg,
we decided that maybe it's best

247
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,634
if you don't talk to us anymore.

248
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,636
Yeah, we could be
targeted by association.

249
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,738
I don't want to get
beaten up by a guy

250
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,606
unless it's in a limo
after prom.

251
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,909
So you're all gonna ditch me
when I need you most?

252
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,511
Yeah, Meg,
it's natural selection.

253
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,346
This is how it works
in the wild.

254
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,181
Hey.
Hey, how you doing?
Hey there.

255
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,916
Hey. Nice spot, huh?
Oh, yeah.

256
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,118
Oh, yeah, it's great.

257
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,919
Especially 'cause of
that thing over there.

258
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,921
You know what's in there? Corn.

259
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,991
Really? Wow.
I could go for some corn.

260
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,093
(crackling)

261
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,428
(laughs)

262
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,763
You're dark, Rog.

263
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,097
I don't care.

264
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,365
Good luck, Meg.

265
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,834
Now we must retreat
into the shadows.

266
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,903
(wind whistling,
bell tinkling)

267
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:17,041
(cries)
What am I gonna do?

268
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,643
QUAGMIRE: Sounds like you have
a pretty big problem, Meg.

269
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,911
Huh?

270
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,281
Mr. Quagmire?

271
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,716
What are you doing in here?

272
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,384
This is my base
of operations.

273
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,452
WOMAN (over intercom):
Mr. Quagmire,

274
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,687
the girls' gym class

275
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,355
will be in the showers
in 20 minutes.

276
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,523
Thank you, Shirley.

277
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,058
She's been with
me 12 years.

278
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,225
It's her birthday today.

279
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,794
Didn't get her anything.
(groans)

280
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,029
So, I guess you heard
about the fight, huh?

281
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,665
Oh, yeah, they're talking about
it in all the girls' bathrooms.

282
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,833
I'm so dead.

283
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,134
No, you're not,

284
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,236
because I'm gonna help you
defeat Mike Pulaski.

285
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,237
You are?

286
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,472
That's right.

287
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,573
Be at my house first
thing tomorrow morning,

288
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,741
and we'll get started.

289
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,676
Wow, thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

290
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,079
Well, I better get home.

291
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:58,515
(horns tooting
and whistles blowing)

292
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,784
What a good way
to get around town.

293
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,660
Okay, Meg, you've got a bully
problem, and I'm gonna help you.

294
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,995
But, Mr. Quagmire,
why would you want to help me?

295
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,997
Because I was once
in your shoes, Meg.

296
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,734
I wasn't always the confident
guy you see before you.

297
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,737
You see, I, too,
was terrorized by a bully.

298
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,841
It was 1986, and the cola wars
were at a frenzy.

299
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,944
I was sitting in the RC section
<i>of the cafeteria</i>

300
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,679
when Tracy Bellings approached.

301
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,281
Why aren't you drinking
Coke, you dork?

302
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,050
Pepsi would also
be acceptable!

303
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,219
It doesn't have
to be a two-cola system!

304
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,021
RC is what keeps the big guys
on their toes!

305
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,057
You know what "RC"
stands for, don't you?

306
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,358
"Chicks Rule!"

307
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,760
QUAGMIRE:
<i>She was dyslexic.</i>

308
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,061
<i>Anyway, that was the beginning</i>

309
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,063
<i>of a long,</i>
<i>abusive relationship.</i>

310
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,432
<i>It's one thing if you put</i>
<i>your penis inside-out</i>

311
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,067
<i>in the safety</i>
<i>of your own bedroom,</i>

312
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,236
<i>but to have it done</i>
<i>in the cafeteria...</i>

313
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,638
<i>To this day,</i>
<i>I can't have sex with a woman</i>

314
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,374
<i>against her will</i>
<i>without thinking about rape.</i>

315
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,243
And that's
why I'm gonna help you, Meg.

316
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,611
I never faced my bully.

317
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,479
I don't want you
to make the same mistake.

318
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,547
But how?

319
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,782
Over the years,

320
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,717
I've tested the limits
of the human body.

321
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,386
How much it can stuff in,
swallow or choke on.

322
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,888
How a scrotum can be stretched

323
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,290
into a makeshift sail
if stranded at sea.

324
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,726
All this knowledge is gonna
help you win your fight.

325
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,161
Oh, thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

326
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,096
I'll take any help I can get.

327
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,397
I haven't been this scared

328
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,566
since my dad stopped showering
for six months.

329
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,101
Great meatloaf, Mom.

330
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,569
Thanks, honey.

331
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,904
PETER:
Hungry!

332
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,272
(flies buzzing)
Hungry!

333
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,107
Pour food on my pile!

334
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,242
Okay, Peter, here you go.

335
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,511
Mmm. I will assimilate
this new smell

336
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,714
into the larger Borg
of my smells.

337
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:44,087
Oh, by the way,
Rupert, good news.

338
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,756
I pooped out your bow tie.

339
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,957
(gasps):
Gaah!

340
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,258
Geez, what the hell, Brian?!

341
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,426
I can't take it anymore!

342
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,594
(knocking on door)

343
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,829
PETER:
Message for Brian Griffin!

344
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,897
(groaning)

345
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,500
(grunts)

346
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,769
I lost my ass gambling.
Have you seen it?

347
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,137
Leave me alone, you jerk!

348
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,471
Stewie, you got to help me.

349
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,106
Peter just won't let up
with the nudity.

350
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,875
Well, you know how
the fat man operates.

351
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,610
He won't stop
unless he's stopped.

352
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,212
The only way
you're going to end this is

353
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,113
if you find a way
to even the score.

354
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,615
You've got to be nude.

355
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,683
Stewie, I <i>am</i> nude.

356
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,851
I'm just covered with fur.

357
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,018
Well, shave it off.

358
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,220
Give him a taste
of his own medicine.

359
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,521
Maybe you're right.

360
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,022
I mean, I got to do something.

361
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,058
This is just one of those things
he won't let up with.

362
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,961
Like when he was guest hosting
<i>Inside the Actor's Studio.</i>

363
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,797
Jeff Daniels, what
is your favorite Care Bear?

364
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,400
I, uh, uh... I don't know
any of the Care Bears.

365
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,670
Right, but if you had to pick
one, who would be your favorite?

366
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,539
Well, like I said,
I'm not really familiar...

367
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,141
You can just say the color.
I know all the Care Bears.

368
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,810
I... I don't know.
The blue one.

369
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,078
There's, like,
11 blue ones, Jeff.

370
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,412
Are you here to dick around,

371
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,381
or you want to do
<i>Inside the Actor's Studio?</i>

372
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:49,820
All right, Meg, the best way
for you to focus your rage is

373
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,488
if I wear the
mask of the person

374
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,223
who's bullied you
every day of your life.

375
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,992
Now, when I give the word,

376
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,994
I want you to come at me
with everything you got.

377
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,729
Oh, hey, Meg.
Hey, Peter.

378
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,431
You know, Peter,
I'm glad I ran into you.

379
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,567
We really need
to talk about Quagmire.

380
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,235
You got time for a beer?

381
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:09,039
I don't know.
He's just so needy.

382
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,375
And I feel like he's
jealous of our friendship.

383
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,010
You all right, Peter?

384
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,778
You seem a little
quiet today.

385
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,380
I'm fine!
Oh, okay, good.

386
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,681
Hey, Peter.
Hey, Joe.

387
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,182
I'm glad
you guys are here.

388
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,184
I've got terrible,
gross medical news for Quagmire.

389
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,420
Maybe you can help me
break it to him.

390
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,857
Mr. Quagmire,
how am I supposed

391
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,458
to beat a guy
like Mike Pulaski?

392
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,726
He's massive!

393
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,561
He may be stronger
than you, but you're grosser.

394
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,796
And you're gonna use that.

395
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,731
Your weird body can be
a dangerous weapon

396
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,366
if used properly.
Okay.

397
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,936
Now, did you ever
play old-school Nintendo?
No.

398
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,305
Well, then what we're about
to do may seem strange,

399
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,539
but just go with it.

400
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,608
(upbeat synthesizer
video game music plays)

401
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,813
(electronic voice):

402
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:54,384
Now, Meg, in order
to get you into fighting shape,

403
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,586
I want you to drink
this glass of raw eggs.

404
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,955
I don't see any yolks.

405
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,489
Just drink it.

406
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,161
(phone ringing)

407
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,562
BRIAN:
Hello?

408
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,830
Cynthia!

409
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,832
Oh, my God! So good
to hear from you!

410
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,068
(door squeaks)
Sure, I can talk.

411
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,236
I'm just sitting
out here in the open.

412
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:17,074
(snickering)

413
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,842
My car? It's a Prius.
(chuckles)

414
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,511
I wouldn't say I'm specifically
a hero for driving one.

415
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,081
The heroes are the ones
who come back from Iraq

416
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,349
and drive a Prius.

417
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,249
Gotcha!

418
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,617
(click)

419
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,419
Wha... what the hell?!

420
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,687
BRIAN:
Hey!

421
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,989
You looking for me?

422
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,126
Oh, God,
what the hell is that?!

423
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,527
What's wrong?
You look uncomfortable.

424
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,262
Here, let me give you a hug.

425
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,365
Aah! Get away from me,
you gremlin!

426
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,102
(whimpering)

427
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,004
Aah! No!

428
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,039
Why don't you rub
my belly, pal?!

429
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,777
(whimpering, wailing)

430
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,279
Your skin is so loose
and wrinkly!

431
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,215
It's like I'm just
pushing around

432
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,550
a plastic bag full
of chicken bones!

433
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,687
Ugh! Why do you have
so many nipples?

434
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,790
You gonna put
your clothes on?!
Yes! Yes! I swear!

435
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,625
You gonna keep 'em on?!
Yes, I promise!

436
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,961
I'll never bother you
again with my body!

437
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,296
(crying):
Please, just make this stop!

438
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,464
Good.

439
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,400
Dad, can you give me
a ride to the... ?

440
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,567
(screams)

441
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,869
What is that thing?!

442
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,404
Aah! Make
it go away!
(whimpering)

443
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,372
What's going on in here?
(Peter whimpers, Chris cries)

444
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,141
Oh, my God,
is that a (bleep) rat?!

445
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,710
Peter, hold it down,
I'm getting the gun!

446
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:31,815
(clock ticking)

447
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,818
(bell rings,
students converse indistinctly)

448
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:37,654
Hey, who you taking
to Meg's funeral?

449
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,889
I'm taking
Jill.

450
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,524
Ooh!

451
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,926
Wise guy,
we're going
as friends.

452
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,961
(crowd cheering)

453
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,237
All right, Meg, remember
what I taught you.

454
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,206
Relax my throat
and make eye contact?

455
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,507
No, no,
the fighting stuff.

456
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,381
Um, listen, before we start,
could you not hit me here

457
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,550
because these are pretty
sensitive? (groans)

458
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:07,851
(cheering)

459
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,025
He punched her pretty!

460
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,295
(crowd groans)
Oh, he punched her ugly again.

461
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,463
ALL:
Ah!

462
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,630
ALL:
Aw!

463
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:21,798
ALL:
Ah!

464
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,033
ALL:
Aw!

465
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,201
ALL:
Ah!

466
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,535
BOY:
Just stop there!

467
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,970
ALL:
Aw!

468
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,472
Punch Rocky Dennis!

469
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,906
It's okay, guys.

470
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,741
I'm at peace
with what I'm all about.

471
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,610
(applause)

472
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:39,049
(cheering)

473
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:44,754
Meg, remember
what I taught you.

474
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,423
Use the gross.

475
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,492
(crowd cheering)

476
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:52,295
You ready for more?

477
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,731
Are <i>you?!</i>

478
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,433
(all gasping)

479
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,734
Ugh!

480
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,903
Your kiss is definitely
not on my list!

481
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,971
He's older.

482
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,341
(laughs)
You missed!

483
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,575
Oh, what's the matter, Mike?

484
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,444
Can't punch a girl
in the face?

485
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,647
You'd be surprised
what my face can do to you!

486
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,383
(all groaning)

487
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:18,355
Ugh! What's your
problem, dude?!

488
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,023
You've got major issues!

489
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,591
Oh, my God, she's crazy!

490
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,461
Did you hear the volleyball
team lost in San Diego?

491
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,431
All right, you little bitch,
it's time to end this thing!

492
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,433
Yeah, it is!

493
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:33,236
(yelling)

494
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,015
Oh, my gosh!
Meg won!

495
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,616
(cheering)

496
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,822
Huh, not bad for a loser.

497
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,691
Thanks for your help,
Mr. Quagmire.

498
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,793
I guess I get
to die another day.

499
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,295
Meg, I got a feeling

500
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,564
you're gonna be around
for a real long time.

501
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,133
Come on, let's
get out of here.

502
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,802
MEG:
<i>But I</i> wasn't <i>around</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

503
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,405
<i>A year later, my body reacted</i>
<i>to a frozen hot dog,</i>

504
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,973
<i>and I died of septic shock.</i>

505
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,376
<i>I became the public face</i>
<i>of internal hot dog defrosting.</i>

506
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,153
(groaning)
Cold.

507
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,321
Well, it worked.

508
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,655
Thanks for your help, Stewie.

509
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,824
If I knew you were
actually gonna do it,

510
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,359
I wouldn't have
suggested it.

511
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,429
You look like my foot that time
Lois made my bath too hot.

512
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,830
Come on! It's not that bad.

513
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,699
My fur will grow back
in about three months.

514
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,334
Well, I can't look at
this for three months,

515
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,668
so I've come up
with a solution.

516
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,737
Put these on.

517
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:45,508
Stewie, I...
Hold still.

518
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,577
(marker squeaking)

519
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:51,081
There you go.

520
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,917
You look good.
You look <i>really</i> good.

521
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,587
Hi, Stewie, and...
(gasps) Stewie?!

522
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,689
This is next week's story.
Get there.

523
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,157
