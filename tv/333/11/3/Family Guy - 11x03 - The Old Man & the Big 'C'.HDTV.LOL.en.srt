12
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:39,087
Boy, what a great day
for a baseball game.

13
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:40,421
Yeah, and these
are the best seats

14
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:42,273
in the house
for catching home run balls.

15
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,541
Aw, that'd be sweet.

16
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,411
The only souvenir I ever got was
at that stock car race.

17
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:55,403
All right,
I got the guy!

18
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:56,588
I got the guy.

19
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,708
Man, I hate
the Yankees.

20
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:02,627
Yeah! You are all villains
to me

21
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:06,181
because I happen to live in this
region of the country. Yeah!

22
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:07,181
(crowd cheering)

23
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:09,183
What's going on?
Did I miss something?

24
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:11,319
Nah, just some idiot streaking
across the field.

25
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:14,789
Ha ha. You're all looking
at my penis.

26
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:18,142
You didn't plan on it,
but it's happening.

27
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:20,895
Oh, cool. Two
spots opened up.

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,830
You, uh-- y-you go ahead.

29
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:24,999
I can wait. I might--
I might wait for a stall.

30
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:26,334
Oh, come on, Peter.

31
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:28,620
We're missing the game.

32
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:30,238
(unzipping)

33
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:31,239
Hey. Hi.

34
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:32,640
Hey.

35
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,642
PETER: <i>Damn it.</i>
<i>He already started.</i>

36
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,145
<i>If I don't start peeing soon,</i>
<i>it's gonna be weird.</i>

37
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:39,147
<i>He'll be all done,</i>
<i>and I'll still be here.</i>

38
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,215
<i>Come on, Peter. Pee.</i>

39
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:41,883
<i>Your dad fought</i>
<i>in World War II,</i>

40
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:43,551
<i>and you can't even pee</i>
<i>in a urinal?</i>

41
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:45,053
<i>What the hell's</i>
<i>wrong with you?</i>

42
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:46,321
All set?
Yup.

43
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:47,322
(zipping)

44
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:48,656
I know you didn't go.

45
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,259
I'm'a go pee
in a stairwell.

46
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:53,494
STADIUM ANNOUNCER: Now batting
for the Red Sox,

47
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:56,030
number 34, David Ortiz.

48
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:57,498
Come on, Big Papi!

49
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,334
(crack of bat, crowd cheering)

50
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:00,835
It's coming straight for us!

51
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,453
I got it, I got it!

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,273
Mine! I got it!
It's my ball

53
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:07,108
Damn it, Brian!
That came to me!

54
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:08,876
That's my ball!

55
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:10,278
(wind whistling)
What?

56
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:11,879
Holy crap!

57
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:15,717
(crowd murmuring)
(gasps)

58
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,852
(crowd laughing hysterically)

59
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:21,723
(slowly increasing
horrified scream)

60
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:23,391
Wow, I guess
all this time,

61
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:25,393
Quagmire should've
been saying "wiggity."

62
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:27,729
Ha!
No, but he'sour friend.

63
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:33,134
TV ANNOUNCER: <i>And now it's time</i>

64
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:34,636
<i>for</i>
<i>the</i> Channel Five Sports Report

65
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,970
<i>brought to you by Kia.</i>

66
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:37,939
<i>Kia: Too bad it's a Kia.</i>

67
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:39,440
A big day at Fenway today,

68
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:41,943
as the Red Sox bested
the Yankees seven to six.

69
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:43,611
But what really
has everyone talking

70
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:46,214
is the fan who lost his toupee
at the game.

71
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,849
The hilarious video already has

72
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:49,951
over two million views
on YouTube.

73
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:52,987
Comments ranged from sympathy
all the way to racial slurs

74
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:54,789
directed at others
who chose to comment.

75
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:56,924
Great, I'm a
laughingstock.

76
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:57,925
What do I do?

77
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,494
Come on, Quagmire.
It's not so bad.

78
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:01,112
You could kill yourself.

79
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:02,547
Well, it's just a thought,

80
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:05,049
but have you ever considered
just embracing your baldness?

81
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,617
Yeah, Brian's right.

82
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,619
You know, there's lots of
big Hollywood celebrities

83
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:10,288
who have gone bald with dignity.

84
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:13,224
John Travolta, David Spade,
Nicolas Cage, Jeremy Piven...

85
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:14,575
And besides,
don't you think

86
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,794
you'll be happier just
being who you really are?

87
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,746
(sighing): Maybe you're
right. What the hell.

88
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,815
I mean, wh-what other choice do
I have at this point?

89
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,183
Everybody knows
now anyway.

90
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:23,167
Great.
Trust me.

91
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,952
Nobody's gonna give
you a hard time.

92
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,688
And even if they do,
just ignore them.

93
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,456
That's what I do
with that weekend bully.

94
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,458
Hey, your weekend sucks!

95
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,226
I've already
gone on a hike

96
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,495
and fixed a few things
around my house!

97
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,596
What are you doing?!

98
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:36,914
Peter, who is that man?

99
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:38,433
I don't want to talk
about it.

100
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:44,339
Dad, there's a weird bald guy
out in front of our house.

101
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:45,656
Ah, that's just Quagmire.

102
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,759
He's acting all different
now that he's bald.

103
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:48,793
I'll go talk to him.

104
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,295
Hey, slow down!

105
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,964
Drive like hell,
you'll get there!

106
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:54,799
Quagmire, what the
hell are you doing?

107
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,801
I'm just letting
all these hot-rodders know

108
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:59,487
that this is a neighborhood,
not a speedway track.

109
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:00,822
Too fast, too fast!

110
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:02,957
Our children should not have
to live in fear!

111
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,759
Okay, well, how come
you're not doing this

112
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,194
in front of your own house?

113
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:08,179
Oh, my ham radio interferes
with the radar gun.

114
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:10,365
Talked to a fella in Papua
New Guinea last night.

115
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:12,533
You should come by sometime
and join in the fun.

116
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:14,202
VOICE ON RADIO: Hello?

117
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:15,536
H-Hello?

118
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:17,372
Are you bald?
(static crackles)

119
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:18,740
Yeah.

120
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:23,344
Can I help you?

121
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,012
Well, I hope you can, Sharon.

122
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:28,015
I'd just like to return this
VHS copy of <i>Pete's Dragon.</i>

123
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:31,018
Watched, enjoyed
and rewound.

124
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:33,020
Uh, there are a lot
of people waiting.

125
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,689
Is there anything else?

126
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,741
Uh, yes. Do you have
a garbage can back there?

127
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:39,961
I have the backings to some
Fruit Roll-Ups I need to discard.

128
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:42,163
I'm sorry. That's for
library trash only.

129
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:43,815
I understand.
That's okay.

130
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:46,167
I'll just hold on to these
for the rest of the day.

131
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:48,169
It ain't easy
bein' green, huh? (weak chuckle)

132
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:49,704
That's from a song.

133
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:50,705
Is that all?

134
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,340
Yeah. Is there
an age restriction

135
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:54,675
for the sleight-of-hand
magic show this afternoon?

136
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,277
Twelve.
Ooh.

137
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:58,846
Maybe I'll just stand
in the hallway and look in.

138
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,516
Now, we all saw you put
your card back in the deck.

139
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,719
So, how did it end up...
in your shirt pocket?

140
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:08,456
Oh, my God,
how did he do that?

141
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:13,795
Oh, no, there's Quagmire.

142
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,497
He's been so
weird lately.

143
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,099
You notice now
that he's bald,

144
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,618
whenever he thinks about something,
he scratches his wrist?

145
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,286
Hey, Quagmire,
we got a pitcher.

146
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,287
You want a beer?

147
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,672
Ehh, I don't think so.

148
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,808
I was planning on looking
at pictures of birds later,

149
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:28,693
and I don't want to be all
fuzzy-headed for that.

150
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,695
Listen, Quagmire,
we hate you now.

151
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,029
Yeah, you used to be fun.

152
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:34,382
Yeah, now you're always either
preparing for a colonoscopy

153
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,033
or just coming back
from a colonoscopy.

154
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,702
The (bleep) going on
down there?

155
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:39,704
Well, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

156
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,388
Come on, we want
our buddy back.

157
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:43,040
I'm not putting that
toupee on again, Peter.

158
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,476
So... I-I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

159
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,145
You could get
a hair transplant.

160
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,997
Oh, yeah. Like one of those guys
pretending to get out of the pool.

161
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:51,282
That looks all right.

162
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,184
Yeah, come on, Quagmire.
Get the hair transplant.

163
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:54,185
Come back to us.

164
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:56,070
You're right.
This isn't me.

165
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:58,406
Baldness is for women's
crotches, not men's heads.

166
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,508
There you go,
that's pretty gross.

167
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,176
Yeah, that's the spirit,
Quagmire.

168
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,262
Oh, boy, listen, thanks
for putting up with me

169
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:05,930
the last couple weeks.
Hey, no problem.

170
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:08,416
You put up with me
when I was barefoot guy.

171
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,935
Boy, nothing like a beer
with the fellas, eh?

172
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,371
Peter, would you mind
putting on some shoes?

173
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:14,705
Oh, you mean
foot prisons?

174
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,740
Yes, I would.

175
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,978
Glenn Quagmire?

176
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,580
Why does that name
sound familiar?

177
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:24,098
Oh, yeah, I treated
you for butt flu.

178
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:25,483
Hey, you want
to keep it down?

179
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,001
Easy now. That's
my privilege

180
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:29,036
as a doctor to talk
about that stuff.

181
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:32,673
How's it going,
Dr. Kamada?

182
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,692
Bob!

183
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:37,461
Mattaaayy.

184
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,280
Oh, hiya, Rachael.

185
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:40,948
Oh, hey, Dr. Geller.

186
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,283
Sarah.

187
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:43,951
Jim.

188
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,453
Merianna.

189
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,621
Geez, Joe.

190
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,055
Yeah, I come here a lot.

191
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,390
All right, I'm gonna
hit the john.

192
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:52,126
Good. Me and Joe can stay here
and tell secrets.

193
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,662
I'm wearing my dead
grandmother's panties.

194
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:57,632
DOCTOR: I'm sorry
to have to tell you this,

195
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,218
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
but the cancer is terminal.

196
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:02,336
If you're lucky,
you've got two weeks to live.

197
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:04,205
I understand.

198
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,473
Oh, my God!

199
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,475
Carter's dying?!

200
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,412
I now declare this
hair transplant officially over!

201
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:12,396
(fires gun)

202
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,564
Hey, hey, hey!

203
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,565
He's back!

204
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,350
You look great,
Quagmire.

205
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:17,818
(pager beeping)

206
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:20,588
Oh, my God. One of my patients
on Two has been shot.

207
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:27,189
Hey, Stewie.

208
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,491
Um, hey, what's up?

209
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,793
Were you-- were you just
looking at Rollerblades?

210
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,128
What? No.
Yeah, who cares?

211
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:33,162
What do you want?

212
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:34,947
Listen, I was at the hospital
earlier,

213
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:37,183
and I heard something
I wish I hadn't.

214
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:40,086
Oh, please do not tell me
it was a sexist remark,

215
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,088
because... because
that is not okay.

216
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:44,423
You know, those nurses
are busting their asses,

217
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,525
weighing people and
seeing how tall they are.

218
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,162
Stewie, I heard a doctor tell
Carter he has two weeks to live.

219
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:51,897
What? Are you sure?

220
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:53,399
I saw it with my own eyes.

221
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,301
I gotta check this out.

222
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:57,119
Oh, my God, you're right!

223
00:07:57,154 --> 00:07:58,337
He looks awful.

224
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:00,539
(beeping)

225
00:08:00,574 --> 00:08:01,874
Wait, how are
we seeing this?

226
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:04,243
Oh, I've got a nanny cam
hidden inside his house.

227
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:05,848
Watching him nail his
cleaning woman is how

228
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:07,279
I'm learning Spanish.

229
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,815
Although I'm not sure what
the Spanish word "no" means,

230
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,351
because it doesn't seem to mean
the same thing as it does here.

231
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:14,987
And the worst part is, I don't
think Lois even knows he's sick.

232
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:17,223
Oh, this is going
to destroy her!

233
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:19,909
Oh, just thinking about
it makes me all giddy.

234
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:21,977
Like a group of women
ordering dessert.

235
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:24,146
And then we have a chocolate,
chocolate cake

236
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:26,665
that's infused with chocolate served
with chocolate ice cream

237
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,167
and a molten
chocolate topping.

238
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:30,086
We'll have one of those
with four spoons.

239
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,671
More like four of those
with one spoon for me!

240
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:35,708
(continuous, staccato,
giddy laughter)

241
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,918
Oh, hi, Brian.

242
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,253
Hey, Lois.

243
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:50,506
Listen, I have something
I need to tell you, but...

244
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,007
it might be difficult for you
to hear.

245
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,075
What is it?

246
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,410
Lois...

247
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:56,245
I think your father is dying.

248
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,813
What?!
(flashbulb pops)

249
00:08:57,831 --> 00:08:59,115
Ha!

250
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:00,950
Brian, what are you
talking about?

251
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:02,585
Well, yesterday at the hospital,

252
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:05,154
I heard a doctor tell him
he has cancer...

253
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:07,089
and that he has
two weeks to live.

254
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:08,524
Oh, my God.

255
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:10,259
Oh, my God, Daddy!

256
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:12,094
Yeah, I feel really
horrible for you,

257
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,662
and I hate to do this,

258
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:15,364
but I'm trying to
catch a 4:50 movie,

259
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:18,134
and it's, like, 4:40 now, and,
so, if I'm going to make it,

260
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:20,169
I have to leave,
like, now.

261
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:26,075
Yeah, this-this stinks,

262
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:29,278
but I've already blown this guy off,
like, twice, so...

263
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,684
I've been trying to call
my parents all day,

264
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:37,403
and I can't get
ahold of them.

265
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:39,572
I'll tell ya, this
obituary came out great.

266
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:42,825
"Carter Pewterschmidt died
today of the disease cancer.

267
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,577
"In lieu of flowers,
please send

268
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:47,863
carnival rides to Peter Griffin
at 31 Spooner Street."

269
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,665
If we get just one
ride out of this,

270
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:51,233
it will have
been a success.

271
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:56,839
Lois?

272
00:09:56,873 --> 00:09:58,240
Wh-What are you
doing here?

273
00:09:58,275 --> 00:10:00,543
Mom, I've been trying
to get ahold of you.

274
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:02,278
Is Daddy okay?
Where is he?

275
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,079
Oh, he's fine, dear.

276
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:05,581
But now's not
a good time.

277
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:06,999
He's very busy.

278
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,734
Look, I know
something's going on.

279
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:09,869
I want to see him.

280
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:13,405
Daddy?!

281
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,192
Well, look who's here!

282
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:18,177
Daddy! You're okay!

283
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,745
Of course I'm okay!
Why wouldn't I be?

284
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,081
Well, Brian said
you were dying!

285
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:23,282
And I finished a book!

286
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:25,451
I promised myself
I'd work that in.

287
00:10:25,485 --> 00:10:27,453
I-It's-- I might've
jumped the gun.

288
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:28,587
I didn't finish it.

289
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:30,923
I'm so glad
you're all right.

290
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:33,642
Brian, how could you get us
all worked up like that?!

291
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:35,110
Yeah, shame on you!

292
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:36,712
Oh, you're gonna
get it, Brian.

293
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:39,081
You are gonna get it
when I drink.

294
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:41,367
What the hell's going on?

295
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,968
Last night, Carter was on
his deathbed,

296
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:44,653
and now he looks better
than he ever did.

297
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:46,472
Well, they say laughter
is the best medicine.

298
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:48,440
Maybe he went to a
comedy club or something.

299
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:49,792
(audience laughing)

300
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:50,826
In my neighborhood,

301
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,328
we didn't have no Kool-Aid.

302
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:54,113
We had food colorin' and water.

303
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:56,181
Mama used to call it
"Fool-Aid."

304
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:58,183
(laughter)
CARTER: No, I don't get that.

305
00:10:58,218 --> 00:10:59,852
And everybody had an Uncle Earl.

306
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:01,854
You know, that uncle
that sit around in the house

307
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:04,657
all day in his underdrawers,
saying he "between" jobs.

308
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:05,991
To be between jobs,

309
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:08,227
you had to have had a job
in the first place!

310
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:09,328
CARTER:
That's accurate!

311
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:11,163
And Earl got that cell phone.

312
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:12,631
He on the Sprint plan.

313
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,099
When the bill come, he sprint.

314
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:17,102
CARTER: Yes! So many of them
are delinquent in payment.

315
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:22,942
Rupert, move your legs.

316
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,243
I can see your balls.

317
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:26,228
Stewie, this is
going to sound crazy,

318
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:28,631
but I have a theory about
what's going on with Carter.

319
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:29,665
Really? What is it?

320
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:30,733
Well, think about it.

321
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:32,034
If Carter Pewterschmidt,

322
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,936
the dynamic chairman of
Pewterschmidt Industries,

323
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,671
were to fall ill
or even die,

324
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:37,239
the stock price
would plummet.

325
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:39,108
I don't want you to think
I'm not listening,

326
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:40,793
but when's Christmas?
Not for a while.

327
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:42,878
But what I'm saying is,
I think Carter is sick

328
00:11:42,913 --> 00:11:45,714
or possibly even dead,
and that the man we saw today

329
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:47,449
was an imposter
brought in to keep

330
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:49,318
Pewterschmidt Industries'
stock price up

331
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:51,320
and to keep people
from knowing the truth.

332
00:11:51,354 --> 00:11:52,988
Boy, you are just
going to keep on talking

333
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:54,823
with that poppy seed
stuck in your teeth, aren't you?

334
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:56,091
Anyway, what are you
suggesting?

335
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:57,776
We can follow him, see
if he's really Carter.

336
00:11:57,811 --> 00:11:59,678
Okay, but I got to be
home by 7:00.

337
00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:01,046
I'm supposed to talk
to the police

338
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,348
about that shooting
I witnessed.

339
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:06,852
Go Lord, are
you all right?

340
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:08,153
If I die,

341
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:11,190
leave two dollars
worth of flowers right here.

342
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:13,809
Here's my fourth grade
class photo.

343
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:15,844
Lean it against
a cheap candle.

344
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,379
Well, should I call
an ambulance?

345
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:19,181
No. Call Channel Nine.

346
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:22,084
And have a gap-toothed
woman say, quote,

347
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:24,553
"He never bothered nobody."

348
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:30,392
Okay, if this guy is an
imposter, he's going to have

349
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:31,760
to do everything
Carter normally does.

350
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:34,196
We just have to wait
and see if he slips up.

351
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,564
All right,
here he comes now.

352
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:43,205
All right, Stu, now,
if we can just...

353
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:44,390
No.
What?

354
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:45,874
You know what you did.

355
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:47,376
Hey, wait a minute.

356
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:48,560
If this is an imposter,

357
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,312
then this guy we're following
never had cancer.

358
00:12:50,347 --> 00:12:51,647
Yeah, so?

359
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:53,732
Well, you're a dog.
Can't you just sniff cancer?

360
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,234
No, that's just a
myth we started

361
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:57,670
so we could stick our
snouts in girls' boobs.

362
00:12:57,704 --> 00:12:59,772
It's nice to have a
clean bill of health.

363
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:00,906
Well, for now.

364
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,608
The key is
weekly follow-ups.

365
00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:05,277
You know, cervical cancer
is also a problem.

366
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:07,479
My boyfriend thinks he
might have prostate cancer.

367
00:13:07,514 --> 00:13:08,847
Nope, doesn't.

368
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:16,038
Okay, now we've got him.

369
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:18,340
The real Carter would
never go to a Starbucks.

370
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,943
He thinks they're too
liberal and pretentious.

371
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:24,296
Coffee for Brent.

372
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,831
(snickering)

373
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:28,150
Latte for Cecil.

374
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:29,785
(snickering)

375
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:31,286
Beanie?

376
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,639
(laughs) None of those
people are real.

377
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:36,425
I'm stealing all your
sugar packets and napkins.

378
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:39,294
Woodstock's over, (bleep).

379
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:52,307
Wow. You certainly
look a lot better

380
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:53,942
than that walking corpse
I saw last week.

381
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:55,811
Well, no one's ever
going to see that again,

382
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:57,146
I can promise you that.

383
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,914
I can't stress how
important it is

384
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:00,449
our secret be kept
from the public.

385
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:01,683
I understand, sir.

386
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:03,919
And I assure you
that Specimen Z

387
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:05,888
is secure on level 12.

388
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:07,189
Did you hear that, Brian?

389
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:09,925
That "walking corpse" was
Carter dying of cancer.

390
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,627
This guy is an imposter.

391
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:13,028
Oh, my God.

392
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:15,798
And I bet Specimen Z
is the real Carter's body.

393
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:17,299
You two didn't
hear that, did you?

394
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,400
BRIAN:
Hey, buddy, we're...

395
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:20,035
we're just trying to
read the paper here.

396
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,104
I'll have you fired
for talking to me like that.

397
00:14:22,138 --> 00:14:23,272
I don't work here.

398
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:25,174
Then I'll have you killed.
I want to die.

399
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,177
I hated that guy back there.

400
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:33,432
Okay, this is level 12.

401
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:34,683
There's the lab.

402
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:36,585
Let's get in there
and find Carter's body.

403
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:37,986
Oh, crap, there's a keypad.

404
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:39,838
All right, we're just
going to have to try

405
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:41,006
and figure out the code.

406
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,174
When's his birthday?

407
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,759
I think it's in March.

408
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:45,077
Stewie, are you crazy?

409
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:46,678
That's so loud.
The guards will hear.

410
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:47,896
Don't worry
about it, Bri...

411
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:49,731
MAN: Hey, what's
going on down there?

412
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,300
Nothing.

413
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:52,835
All right.

414
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:54,520
All right, now,
where would they keep

415
00:14:54,554 --> 00:14:56,939
a dead body
in a pharmaceutical lab?

416
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:58,690
(gasps) Brian, look.

417
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:02,311
That's it.
I bet he's in there.

418
00:15:11,638 --> 00:15:13,505
Oh, my God.

419
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,974
Specimen Z isn't Carter's body.

420
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:17,159
What is it?

421
00:15:17,193 --> 00:15:19,895
Specimen Z is a
cure for cancer.

422
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,666
Carter didn't die.
He cured himself.

423
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,518
CARTER: Hold it right there.
(both gasp)

424
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:28,253
Damn it, Brian.
You broke into my lab.

425
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:29,822
And you didn't wear a suit.

426
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:32,257
Hey, why didn't he
have to wear a suit?

427
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,692
See what you've started now?

428
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:41,315
Carter, you've found
a cure for cancer?

429
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:42,749
Well, I didn't come up with it.

430
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:44,184
A couple of eggheads
I hired did.

431
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:46,086
One of them's a Chinese.

432
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,688
Boy, I don't like those people.

433
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:50,390
But holy crap, wind 'em up
and watch 'em go.

434
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:51,758
How long have you had this?

435
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,327
I don't know.
When... when was that

436
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:54,695
"Who Let the Dogs Out?" song?

437
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:56,563
You've had this since 1999?

438
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:59,066
You know when "Who Let
the Dogs Out?" came out?

439
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,101
It's a song about dogs
and letting them out.

440
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:03,370
I could have you arrested
for breaking in here.

441
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:05,923
Carter, you've discovered the
holy grail of modern medicine.

442
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:08,108
Why the hell would you
keep it buried like this?

443
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,192
I'll tell you why.

444
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:10,861
Because there's
far more money to be made

445
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,663
in treating a disease
than in curing it.

446
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:14,498
Why cure someone
of cancer in a day

447
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:16,199
if we can treat them
for a lifetime

448
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:17,901
and bill them
every step along the way?

449
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,403
What? That's insane.

450
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,889
Brian, it's so cold in here,
look how big my nips are.

451
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:23,657
They're almost like a woman's.

452
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,277
Oh, look, I'm tugging at 'em
and they're getting even bigger.

453
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:28,745
Carter, what you're
doing here is criminal,

454
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,864
and I'm going to tell the
whole world about it.

455
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,499
Is that right?
Who's going to believe you?

456
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,734
The Internet?

457
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:36,036
You'll be just another nut-job,
left-wing blogger.

458
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,404
Security!

459
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:38,572
MAN:
Everything's fine.

460
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:39,940
No, it isn't. Get in here.

461
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,460
Ah! Damn it! You bastards.

462
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,479
I don't know why you're
surprised by this, Brian.

463
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:47,314
Big corporations
never tell the truth.

464
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,383
ok at the
Kleenex industry.

465
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:50,751
Well, we had another
good quarter.

466
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:52,953
I guess a lot of people
are sneezing out there.

467
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:54,821
Jerry, I'm going to let you
in on something,

468
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:56,590
and it can't
leave this room.

469
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:57,758
Our research shows

470
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,993
the primary use
of our product is sperm.

471
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,128
What?

472
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:02,696
Yeah, and brace
yourself for this.

473
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,499
The second biggest use
is women crying about nonsense.

474
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,000
But I thought
sneezing was...

475
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:09,953
Jerry, Jerry,
it's sperm and nonsense.

476
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,540
I can't believe Carter

477
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,292
would sacrifice
millions of lives

478
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,793
just to protect
corporate profits.

479
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,128
Well, don't be too upset.

480
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,413
Old Stewie here snagged

481
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:21,298
a little souvenir
on his way out.

482
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,716
Oh, my God, Stewie.

483
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,950
You got the cancer cure.

484
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:25,335
How'd you manage to steal it?

485
00:17:25,386 --> 00:17:26,970
Oh, it was easy--
I just took it

486
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,388
while you guys
were yammering on.

487
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,140
I swear, I felt
like I was waiting

488
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,758
for Lois to get
off the phone.

489
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,427
Well, that is amazing.

490
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,628
All right, Bonnie.

491
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:36,296
Well, it was good
talking to you.

492
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:38,265
No way. She did?

493
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:39,866
When did she say that?

494
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:41,134
You know what?

495
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:44,037
That doesn't surprise me.
That's how she is.

496
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:46,306
Okay, then. Okay.

497
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:48,408
Okay. Okay.

498
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,344
All right,
I'll see you Tuesday.

499
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:53,397
Oh, no. What happened?

500
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:55,198
(gasps) That's terrible.

501
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,834
Oh, my God, just awful.

502
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,703
Well, you
give them my best.

503
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:01,171
Okay, I got to go.

504
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,240
Stewie and I are headed
out to the beach.

505
00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:04,808
Oh, I didn't tell you?

506
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:06,443
He's learning to swim.

507
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:08,779
Oh, I got him
the cutest swim trunks.

508
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,230
At Kohl's.

509
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:12,165
You've never
been to Kohl's?

510
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,167
Well, let me tell you
about Kohl's.

511
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:15,435
(sighs)

512
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,621
All right, well, you know
the mall with the Chili's?

513
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:19,056
It's across the street.

514
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,257
(gunshot, Bonnie shrieks)

515
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,758
Bonnie?
Bonnie, are you there?

516
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:23,694
What happened?
STEWIE: Let's go!

517
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,532
Oh, there you two are.

518
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,800
Lois, there's
something incredible

519
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:30,967
I have to tell you.

520
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:32,102
And there's
something incredible

521
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,403
I have to show you.

522
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:36,039
I learned how to
do a somersault.

523
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,742
Did I do it?

524
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:40,444
There he is.

525
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:42,546
Crap.

526
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,548
Daddy? What's going on here?

527
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,784
Brian here has stolen something
very important from me.

528
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:50,037
Give it to me, Brian.

529
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:51,855
Lois, your father
has a cure for cancer,

530
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:53,907
but he won't release it
because it's not profitable.

531
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,409
So I stole it.

532
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:56,943
Daddy, is this true?

533
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:58,261
Yeah. So what?

534
00:18:58,296 --> 00:19:00,564
So I found the cure for cancer
and didn't announce it.

535
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,232
Big deal.
I also took a dump today

536
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,600
and didn't issue
a press release.

537
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:05,402
Oh, that's interesting,
because I did.

538
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,970
Good for Peter.

539
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:09,573
It's about time the media
covered something positive.

540
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,175
Daddy, you're the chairman
of a billion dollar company.

541
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,877
You've got more
money than anyone

542
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,545
could ever spend
in one lifetime.

543
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,415
Are you challenging me
to a <i>Brewster's Millions?</i>

544
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,417
Is money all that
you care about?

545
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,686
What if somebody close
to you got cancer?

546
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,088
What if... what if the
maid who raised you

547
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,941
'cause your parents were too
wealthy and busy got cancer?

548
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:29,142
You mean Mamie?

549
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:31,178
Yeah.
What if Mamie got cancer?

550
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,846
Mamie's not getting cancer!

551
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,147
Or how about one of us?

552
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:36,450
What if I got cancer
or, God forbid,

553
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:38,285
one of your grandchildren?

554
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,621
For once in your life,
do the right thing.

555
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:43,223
All right, pumpkin.

556
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:44,591
I'll do it.

557
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,359
I'll do it for you.

558
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,462
You will? You promise?

559
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:49,529
Yes.

560
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,964
I'll make the
announcement tomorrow.

561
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:52,299
Oh, Daddy.

562
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,400
Thank you so much.

563
00:19:53,434 --> 00:19:55,135
You're my hero.

564
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,704
Oh, that's her father?

565
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:02,909
Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker.

566
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,644
Our top story:
a big announcement

567
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,780
out of Pewterschmidt
Pharmaceuticals today.

568
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,584
Company chairman
Carter Pewterschmidt

569
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:12,285
released a statement
announcing the launch

570
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,354
of a deodorant
for the developmentally disabled

571
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:15,922
called Slow Stick.

572
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:19,759
It's also edible because,
you know, those people...

573
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:22,028
don't, uh... don't know...

574
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:23,530
And now sports.

575
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:25,098
That's it?
What the hell?

576
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:27,134
Where's the cancer
cure announcement?

577
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:30,003
That son of a bitch
went back on his word.

578
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:32,589
CARTER:
Hello.

579
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:34,891
Daddy, we're all sitting here
in front of the TV

580
00:20:34,926 --> 00:20:36,359
awaiting the big announcement.

581
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:39,629
Remember the one that's
going to benefit all mankind?

582
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:42,532
The one you promised to make
for me, your daughter?

583
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,201
I lied.
(line clicks)

584
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:45,769
Lois, you can't
stay mad at him.

585
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,204
He's rich and successful.

586
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:48,672
It doesn't excuse
what he did.

587
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,823
It'll be fine.

588
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,458
He'll just do
a magazine cover

589
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:53,994
with a wink to who he is,
and all will be forgiven.

590
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,397
Oh, Daddy.

591
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,355
I know. If he's such a bad
guy, why's he on a magazine?
