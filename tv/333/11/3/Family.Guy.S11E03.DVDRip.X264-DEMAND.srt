00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,348
Jim.

154
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,753
Merianna.

155
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,193
- Geez, Joe.
- Yeah, I come here a lot.

156
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,389
All right, I'm gonna hit the john.

157
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,023
Good. Me and Joe can stay here
and tell secrets.

158
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm wearing my dead
grandmother's panties.

159
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,533
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Mr. Pewterschmidt,

160
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,165
but the cancer is terminal.

161
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,003
If you're lucky,
you've got two weeks to live.

162
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,272
I understand.

163
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,072
Oh, my God! Carter's dying?

164
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,044
I now declare this hair transplant
officially over!

165
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,854
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, he's back!

166
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,447
You look great, Quagmire.

167
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,752
(BEEPING)

168
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,692
Oh, my God.
One of my patients on Two has been shot.

169
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,264
- Hey, Stewie.
- Um, hey, what's up?

170
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,565
Were you...
Were you just looking at Rollerblades?

171
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,503
What? No. Yeah, who cares?
What do you want?

172
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,503
Listen, I was at the hospital earlier,
and I heard something I wish I hadn't.

173
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,747
Oh. Please do not tell me
it was a sexist remark,

174
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,646
because that is not okay.

175
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,877
You know, those nurses
are busting their asses,

176
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,954
weighing people
and seeing how tall they are.

177
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,589
Stewie, I heard a doctor tell Carter
he has two weeks to live.

178
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,449
What? Are you sure?

179
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,922
I saw it with my own eyes.

180
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,560
I gotta check this out.

181
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,758
Oh, my God, you're right! He looks awful.

182
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,559
(MONITOR BEEPING)

183
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,362
Wait, how are we seeing this?

184
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,003
Oh, I've got a nanny cam
hidden inside his house.

185
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,734
Watching him nail his cleaning woman
is how I'm learning Spanish.

186
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,003
Although I'm not sure what
the Spanish word "no" means,

187
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,670
because it doesn't seem to mean
the same thing as it does here.

188
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,339
And the worst part is,
I don't think Lois even knows he's sick.

189
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,078
Oh, this is going to destroy her!

190
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:32,316
Just thinking about it makes me all giddy,
like a group of women ordering dessert.

191
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,883
And then we have
a chocolate, chocolate cake

192
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,052
that's infused with chocolate
served with chocolate ice cream

193
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,560
and a molten chocolate topping.

194
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,392
We'll have one of those with four spoons.

195
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,000
More like four of those
with one spoon for me!

196
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,395
(LAUGHING)

197
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,715
- Oh, hi, Brian.
- Hey, Lois.

198
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,510
Listen, I have something I need to tell you,
but it might be difficult for you to hear.

199
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,379
- What is it?
- Lois,

200
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,521
- I think your father is dying.
- What?

201
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,692
Ha!

202
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,556
Brian, what are you talking about?

203
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:16,155
Well, yesterday at the hospital,
I heard a doctor tell him he has cancer,

204
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,598
and that he has two weeks to live.

205
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,732
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Daddy!

206
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,668
Yeah, I feel really horrible for you,
and I hate to do this,

207
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:27,370
but I'm trying to catch a 4:50 movie,
and it's, like, 4:40 now,

208
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,379
and so if I'm gonna make it,
I have to leave, like, now.

209
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,582
Yeah, this stinks,

210
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,418
but I've already blown this guy off,
like, twice, so...

211
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,588
I've been trying to call my parents all day,
and I can't get ahold of them.

212
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,562
Mom, is Grandpa gonna die?

213
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,498
No, Chris, God's gonna help him,
and he's gonna get better.

214
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,771
He is gonna die, Chris, and there is no God.

215
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,908
Meg, stop being truthful with your brother.

216
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,371
I'll tell you, this obituary came out great.

217
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,777
"Carter Pewterschmidt died today
of the disease cancer.

218
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,941
"In lieu of flowers,
please send carnival rides to Peter Griffin

219
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,575
"at 31 Spooner Street."

220
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,180
If we get just one ride out of this,
it will have been a success.

221
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,355
Lois? What are you doing here?

222
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,491
Mom, I've been trying to get ahold of you.
ls Daddy okay? Where is he?

223
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,570
Oh, he's fine, dear,
but now's not a good time.

224
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,036
He's very busy.

225
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,903
Look, I know somethings going on.
I want to see him.

226
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,005
Daddy?

227
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,173
- Well, look who's here!
- Daddy! You're okay!

228
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:43,047
- Of course I'm okay! Why wouldn't I be?
- Well, Brian said you were dying!

229
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,586
And I finished a book!

230
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,124
I promised myself I'd work that in.
I might've jumped the gun.

231
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,582
I didn't finish it.

232
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,920
I'm so glad you're all right.

233
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,555
Brian, how could you get us
all worked up like that?

234
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,928
Yeah, shame on you!

235
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,526
Oh, you're gonna get it, Brian.
You are gonna get it when I drink.

236
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,372
What the hell's going on?

237
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,374
Last night, Carter was on his deathbed,
and now he looks better than he ever did.

238
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,341
Well, they say laughter
is the best medicine.

239
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,413
Maybe he went to a comedy club
or something.

240
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,947
(LAUGHING)

241
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,313
In my neighborhood,
we didn't have no Kool-Aid.

242
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,147
We had food coloring and water.

243
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,619
- Mama used to call it "Fool-Aid."
-(LAUGHING)

244
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,018
CARTER: No, I don't get that.

245
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,784
And everybody had an Uncle Earl.

246
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,759
You know, that uncle that sit around
in the house all day in his under-drawers

247
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,487
saying he between jobs.

248
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:29,191
To be between jobs,
you had to have had a job in the first place!

249
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,426
-(LAUGHING)
- CARTER: That's accurate!

250
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,402
And Earl got that cellphone.
He on the Sprint plan.

251
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,403
When the bill come, he sprint.

252
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,031
CARTER: Yes! So many of them
are delinquent in payment.

253
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,081
Rupert, move your legs.
I can see your balls.

254
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,514
Stewie, this is gonna sound crazy,

255
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,950
but I have a theory
about what's going on with Carter.

256
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,919
- Really? What is it?
- Well, think about it.

257
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,285
If Carter Pewterschmidt,

258
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,120
the dynamic chairman
of Pewterschmidt Industries,

259
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,457
were to fall ill or even die,
the stock price would plummet.

260
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,723
I don't want you to think I'm not listening,

261
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,799
-but when's Christmas?
- Not for a while.

262
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,494
But what I'm saying is, I think
Carter is sick or possibly even dead,

263
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,832
and that the man we saw today
was an imposter

264
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,533
brought in to keep
Pewterschmidt Industries' stock price up

265
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,165
and to keep people from knowing the truth.

266
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,739
Boy, you are just gonna keep on talking

267
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,744
with that poppy seed stuck in your teeth,
aren't you?

268
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,906
- Anyway, what are you suggesting?
- We can follow him,

269
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,243
see if he's really Carter.

270
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,646
Okay, but I got to be home by 7:00.

271
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,243
I'm supposed to talk to the police
about that shooting I witnessed.

272
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,855
Good Lord, are you all right?

273
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:32,157
If I die, leave two dollars'
worth of flowers right here.

274
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:37,066
Here's my fourth grade class photo.
Lean it against a cheap candle.

275
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,228
- Should I call an ambulance?
- No. Call Channel Nine.

276
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:44,797
And have a gap-toothed woman say, quote,
"He never bothered nobody."

277
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,704
Okay, if this guy is an imposter,

278
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,443
he's gonna have to do
everything Carter normally does.

279
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,450
We just have to wait and see if he slips up.

280
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,576
All right, here he comes now.

281
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:03,893
All right, Stu, now, if we can just...

282
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,462
- No.
- What?

283
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,996
You know what you did.

284
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,389
Hey, wait a minute. If this is an imposter,

285
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,764
then this guy we're following
never had cancer.

286
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,632
- Yeah, so?
- Well, you're a dog.

287
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,103
Can't you just sniff cancer?

288
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,539
No, that's just a myth we started so
we could stick our snouts in girls' boobs.

289
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,973
(SIGHS)
it's nice to have a clean bill of health.

290
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,275
Well, for now.
The key is weekly follow-ups.

291
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,577
You know, cervical cancer
is also a problem.

292
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,549
My boyfriend thinks
he might have prostate cancer.

293
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,642
Nope, doesn't.

294
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,327
Okay, now we've got him.

295
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,327
The real Carter
would never go to a Starbucks.

296
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,796
He thinks they're too liberal
and pretentious.

297
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,831
- Coffee for Brent.
-(CHUCKLING)

298
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,163
Latte for Cecil.

(CONTINUES CHUCKLING)

300
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,199
- Beanie?
-(LAUGHS)

00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,642
None of those people are real.

302
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,373
I'm stealing all your sugar packets
and napkins.

303
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,608
Woodstock's over, assholes.

00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,326
Wow. You certainly look a lot better
than that walking corpse I saw last week.

305
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,163
Well, no one's ever gonna see that again,
I can promise you that.

306
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,727
I can't stress how important it is
our secret be kept from the public.

307
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:22,828
I understand, sir.

308
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,740
And I assure you that Specimen Z
is secure on level 12.

309
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,303
Did you hear that, Brian?

310
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,313
That "walking corpse"
was Carter dying of cancer.

311
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,111
- This guy is an imposter.
- Oh, my God.

312
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,812
And I bet Specimen Z
is the real Carter's body.

313
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,878
You two didn't hear that, did you?

314
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,458
BRIAN: Hey, buddy, we're just trying
to read the paper here.

315
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,185
I'll have you fired
for talking to me like that.

316
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,283
BRIAN: I don't work here.

317
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,021
- Then I'll have you killed.
- BRIAN: I want to die.

318
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,157
I hated that guy back there.

319
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,366
Okay, this is level 12.

320
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,433
There's the lab.
Let's get in there and find Carter's body.

321
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,870
Oh, crap, there's a keypad.

322
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,945
We're just gonna have to try
and figure out the code.

323
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,412
When's his birthday? I think it's in March.

324
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,908
Stewie, are you crazy?
That's so loud. The guards will hear.

325
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,147
- Don't worry about it, Brian.
- MAN: Hey, what's going on down there?

326
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,689
- Nothing.
- All right.

327
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,918
All right, now, where would they keep
a dead body in a pharmaceutical lab?

328
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,490
(GASPS) Brian, look.

329
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,598
That's it. I bet he's in there.

330
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,839
Oh, my God!

331
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,141
Specimen Z isn't Carter's body.

332
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,809
- What is it?
- Specimen Z is a cure for cancer.

333
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,650
Carter didn't die. He cured himself.

334
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,348
- Hold it right there.
-(BOTH GASP)

335
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,092
Damn it, Brian. You broke into my lab.
And you didn't wear a suit.

336
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:54,926
- Hey, why didn't he have to wear a suit?
- See what you've started now?

337
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,604
Carter, you found a cure for cancer?

338
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,605
Well, I didn't come up with it.
A couple of eggheads I hired did.

339
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,644
One of them's a Chinese.

340
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,269
Boy, I don't like those people.

341
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,712
But holy crap,
wind them up and watch them go.

342
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,109
How long have you had this?

343
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,014
I don't know. When was that
<i>Who Let the Dogs Out?</i> song?

344
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,348
You've had this since 1999?

345
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,515
You know when
<i>Who Let the Dogs Out?</i> came out?

346
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,489
It's a song about dogs and letting them out.

347
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,683
I could have you arrested
for breaking in here.

348
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,330
Carter, you've discovered
the holy grail of modern medicine.

349
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,399
Why the hell would you
keep it buried like this?

350
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,625
I'll tell you why.

351
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,100
Because there's far more money
to be made

352
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,171
in treating a disease than in curing it.

353
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,240
Why cure someone of cancer in a day
if we can treat them for a lifetime

354
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,104
and bill them every step along the way?

355
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,739
What? That's insane.

356
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,507
Brian, it's so cold in here,
look how big my nips are.

357
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,604
They're almost like a woman's.

358
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,514
Oh, look, I'm tugging at them
and they're getting even bigger.

359
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,154
Carter, what you're doing here is criminal,
and I'm gonna tell the whole world about it.

360
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,020
Is that right? Who's gonna believe you?
The Internet?

361
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,890
You'll be just another nut-job,
left-wing blogger.

362
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,929
- Security!
- MAN: Everything's fine.

363
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,225
No, it isn't. Get in here.

364
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,360
(GRUNTS) Damn it! You bastards!

365
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,164
I don't know
why you're surprised by this, Brian.

366
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,170
Big corporations never tell the truth.

367
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,638
Look at the Kleenex industry.

368
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,371
Well, we had another good quarter.

369
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,501
I guess a lot of people
are sneezing out there.

370
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,412
Jerry, I'm going to let you in on something,
and it can't leave this room.

371
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,883
Our research shows the primary use
of our product is sperm.

372
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,318
- What?
- Yeah, and brace yourself for this.

373
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,186
The second biggest use
is women crying about nonsense.

374
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,091
- But I thought sneezing was...
- Jerry, Jerry, it's sperm and nonsense.

375
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,662
I can't believe Carter
would sacrifice millions of lives

376
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,325
just to protect corporate profits.

377
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,562
Well, don't be too upset.

378
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,537
Old Stewie here snagged
a little souvenir on his way out.

379
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,472
Oh, my God, Stewie.
You got the cancer cure.

380
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,599
How'd you manage to steal it?

381
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,109
It was easy. I just took it
while you guys were yammering on.

382
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,910
I swear, I felt like I was waiting
for Lois to get off the phone.

383
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:57,549
That is amazing. All right, Bonnie.
Well, it was good talking to you.

384
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,053
No way. She did? When did she say that?

385
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:05,552
You know what? That doesn't surprise me.
That's how she is.

386
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:11,329
Okay, then. Okay. Okay. Okay.
All right, I'll see you Tuesday.

387
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,167
Oh, no. What happened?

388
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,941
(GASPS) That's terrible.
Oh, my God, just awful.

389
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,440
Well, you give them my best.

390
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:25,003
Okay, I got to go.
Stewie and I are headed out to the beach.

391
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,983
Oh, I didn't tell you? He's learning to swim.

392
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,452
Oh, I got him the cutest swim trunks.
At Kohl's.

393
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,652
You've never been to Kohl's?
Well, let me tell you about Kohl's.

394
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:36,725
(swans)

395
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,121
All right, well, you know
the mall with the Chili's?

396
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,253
It's across the street.

397
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,353
-(GUN FIRES)
-(WOMAN SCREAMS)

398
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,160
Bonnie? Bonnie, are you there?

399
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,734
- What happened?
- STEWIE: Let's go!

400
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,500
Oh, there you two are.

401
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,542
Lois, there's something incredible
I have to tell you.

402
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,804
And there's something incredible
I have to show you.

403
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,641
I learned how to do a somersault.

404
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,912
Did I do it?

405
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,584
- There he is.
- Crap.

406
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,155
Daddy? What's going on here?

407
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,158
Brian here has stolen something
very important from me.

408
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,693
Give it to me, Brian.

409
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,360
Lois, your father has a cure for cancer,

410
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,523
but he won't release it
because it's not profitable.

411
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,656
So I stole it.

412
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,797
- Daddy, is this true?
- Yeah. So what?

413
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,997
So I found the cure for cancer
and didn't announce it.

414
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,007
Big deal. I also took a dump today
and didn't issue a press release.

415
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,576
Oh, that's interesting, because I did.

416
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,404
Good for Peter.

417
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,707
It's about time the media
covered something positive.

418
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,879
Daddy, you're the chairman
of a billion dollar company.

419
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:37,112
You've got more money than anyone
could ever spend in one lifetime.

420
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,688
Are you challenging me
to a Brewster's Millions?

421
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,925
Is money all that you care about?

422
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,324
What if somebody close to you got cancer?

423
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,362
What if the maid who raised you

424
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,227
'cause your parents were
too wealthy and busy got cancer?

425
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,025
- You mean Mamie?
- Yeah.

426
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,431
What if Mamie got cancer?

427
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,170
Mamie's not getting cancer!

428
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,872
Or how about one of us?

429
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,807
What if I got cancer or, God forbid,
one of your grandchildren?

430
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,879
For once in your life, do the right thing.

431
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,974
All right, pumpkin. I'll do it.

432
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,611
I'll do it for you.

433
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,715
You will? You promise?

434
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,185
Yes.
I'll make the announcement tomorrow.

435
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:16,220
Oh, Daddy. Thank you so much.
You're my hero.

436
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,525
Oh, that's her father?

437
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,429
<i>Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

438
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,002
<i>Our top story, a big announcement</i>

439

<i>out of Pewterschmidt

440
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,904
<i>Company chairman Carter Pewterschmidt</i>

441
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,670
<i>released a statement
announcing the launch</i>

442
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,110
<i>of a deodorant for the developmentally
disabled called Slow Stick.</i>

443
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:42,018
<i>It's also edible because,
you know, those people don't...</i>

444
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,848
<i>Don't know... And now sports.</i>

445
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,920
That's it? What the hell?
Where's the cancer cure announcement?

446
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,290
That son of a bitch went back on his word.

447

<i>- CARTER: Hello?</i>
- Daddy.

448
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,495
We're all sitting here in front of the TV
awaiting the big announcement.

449
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,161
Remember the one
that's gonna benefit all mankind?

450
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,207
The one you promised
to make for me, your daughter?

He's rich and successful.
