Chris, would you like
to read your personal essay?

6
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,039
Okay, Mrs. Donovan.

7
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:12,377
"Following Mrs. Donovan"
by Chris Griffin.

8
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:14,562
"The first thing that
Mrs. Donovan does

9
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:16,264
"when she gets
home from school

10
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:17,716
"is put on sweatpants.

11
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,001
"Then she eats a whole
tube of cookie dough,

12
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:21,669
"but she must be
allergic to it

13
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:23,822
"because there are tears
coming out of her eyes

14
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:25,857
"and she always
throws up right after.

15
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,675
"Then she puts
paper doll clothes

16
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,444
on a picture
of a sonogram."

17
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:30,779
Chris, I think
you should stop.

18
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,947
What? I'm doing
the best I can.

19
00:01:32,982 --> 00:01:34,883
I'm not Nathaniel
Hawthorne.

20
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,670
Nathaniel,
what are you doing?

21
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:41,072
Just ruining ninth
grade for everyone.

22
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,177
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I called you in today

23
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:47,712
because your son, Chris,
has been getting

24
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:49,414
in quite a bit of
trouble lately.

25
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:51,933
In fact, just yesterday,
he tried to pass

26
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:55,270
this drawing off
as his Advanced Art project.

27
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:57,505
Oh, my.
I'm very embarrassed.

28
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,007
Well, someone should be.

29
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,408
I'm sorry,
Principal Shepherd.

30
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:02,343
We've tried talking
to Chris.

31
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:04,012
We just don't know
what else to do.

32
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:05,847
Well, I think we may
have a solution.

33
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:07,982
We have these cats that
hang around the school,

34
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:09,250
and we feed them.

35
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:10,552
Why doesn't
Chris come in,

36
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:12,637
and we can treat him
like one of the cats?

37
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:14,889
And in a couple of years,
we'll give him a diploma.

38
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:16,090
That doesn't
sound like

39
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,358
he'll be getting
the best education.

40
00:02:17,393 --> 00:02:18,526
I don't know, Lois.

41
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:20,945
Some of those cats go on
to get pretty good jobs.

42
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:24,199
Yep.

43
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:29,888
We now return to <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

44
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:33,458
You will recommend
<i>Breaking Bad</i>

45
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,226
to everyone you know.

46
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:38,296
I will recommend <i>Breaking Bad</i>
to everyone I know.

47
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,166
<i>Breaking Bad</i> is the best show
you've ever seen,

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,901
except maybe <i>The Wire.</i>

49
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:45,603
<i>Breaking Bad</i>
is the best show I've ever seen,

50
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:47,272
except maybe <i>The Wire.</i>

51
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:48,706
You will never stop talking

52
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:51,009
about <i>Breaking Bad</i>
or <i>The Wire.</i>

53
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:55,013
I will never stop talking
about <i>Breaking Bad</i> or <i>The Wire.</i>

54
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:57,098
Peter, I'm really
worried about Chris.

55
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:59,017
What are we going
to do about him?

56
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:01,753
What the hell happened

57
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:03,454
to all the smart genes
in this family?

58
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,306
I mean, I invent
the razor blade comb,

59
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:06,658
and my kids
are doing nothing.

60
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:08,960
I mean, when Chris grows
up, will he even be able

61
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:11,095
to get a job or take
care of himself?

62
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,331
And what's he going
to do when we die?

63
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:18,169
♪ Ooga chaka, ooga ooga,
ooga chaka... ♪

64
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:21,406
♪ I can't stop
this feeling ♪

65
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,143
♪ Deep inside
of me... ♪

66
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:26,778
I feel awful
saying it,

67
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,180
but I'm kind of embarrassed
by him sometimes.

68
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,082
I know, and he's
got boobs, too.

69
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:32,684
Stupid guy with boobs.

70
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:34,402
Acting like he
doesn't want us to look.

71
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:35,737
He wants us to look.

72
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,105
Stop making fun of me!

73
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:40,675
I just wanted to listen
to you guys have sex,

74
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,344
but you were saying
mean things about me.

75
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,646
Chris!
Oh, my God.

76
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,798
No, we weren't
talking about you.

77
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:48,383
Yeah, we were talking
about Meg.

78
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,285
We call her Chris
so she doesn't know.

79
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,220
you!
Shut up, Chris!

80
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:54,022
I know that's not true.

81
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:57,158
Oh, God.

82
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:59,010
Peter, he heard us
call him stupid.

83
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:00,278
His own parents.

84
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:01,579
What have we done?

85
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:02,680
Well, you know, Lois,

86
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:03,982
it's never easy
hearing the truth.

87
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:05,800
Especially from
a fortune cookie.

88
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:11,072
What does it
say, Peter?

89
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:12,824
Uh, just something
about perseverance.

90
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:14,108
What does yours say?

91
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:16,010
It says I'm
very creative.

92
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,238
Oh, by the way, there's a baby
in my preschool with HIV,

93
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:29,073
and my teacher gave you
something to sign

94
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,408
to get him kicked out.

95
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:32,377
Hey, Chris!

96
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,345
There's my big, smart son.

97
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,347
My special guy,
my Chrissy.

98
00:04:36,382 --> 00:04:39,550
Sounds like someone got her
vibrator working again.

99
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:40,952
Oh, look out, everyone.

100
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:43,288
Double-digit IQ
joining the table.

101
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,123
Hey, smarty, think fast.
Aah!

102
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:47,208
He knows.
He knows it's hot.

103
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:48,509
'Cause he's smart.

104
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:50,178
I don't want
to talk to you guys.

105
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:51,512
You called me
an idiot.

106
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:53,548
Oh, Chris, you must
have just misheard us.

107
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:54,983
I was standing
right there.

108
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:56,451
How is that
possible?

109
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:57,581
'Cause you're an idiot--
that's how.

110
00:04:57,606 --> 00:04:58,220
Peter!

111
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:00,955
I'm going
to school!

112
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,390
It's Sunday,
right?

113
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:05,059
Peter, we've completely
destroyed his self-esteem.

114
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:06,894
We've got to
do something.

115
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:08,813
You know, Lois, if Chris is
having confidence issues,

116
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:10,264
they have camps
for kids like him.

117
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:11,549
What do you mean?

118
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,301
Well, they take kids
who struggle in school

119
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:14,602
and help them gain
self-confidence

120
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:16,104
in a nurturing
environment.

121
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:18,373
Wow. That's actually
a great idea.

122
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:19,857
We don't got
no money for camp.

123
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:21,359
We're saving up
to go to Europe.

124
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:23,494
Peter, we went to Europe.
You didn't like it.

125
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,079
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

126
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:27,048
My TV isn't here.
Let's go home.

127
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:33,388
We now return
to <i>Canadian Horror Story.</i>

128
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:35,356
Hey, hon, we're
out of Molson.

129
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:36,624
Oh, not to worry.

130
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,326
We've got some Labatt's
in the garage.

131
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,094
And could you get one
for the ghost?

132
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:41,412
Boo, eh?

133
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:43,982
Hey, Chris,
could we talk to you?

134
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:46,617
If you're going to insult me
again, just go away.

135
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:48,219
Look, honey, we're sorry,

136
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:50,121
and we want to do
something special for you.

137
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:51,395
This is a Hamilton
Beach blender

138
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:52,707
we got on our
wedding day.

139
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:54,008
It keeps coming
back to us

140
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:55,176
in a vicious
regifting cycle.

141
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,511
No, Peter.

142
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:58,413
Chris, we were thinking
of sending you to camp.

143
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:01,332
And we're going to let
you choose which one.

144
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:03,334
This one's called
Camp Helmet.

145
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:05,737
This one's called
Camp Sit 'N' Stay.

146
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:07,772
These camps
don't sound fun at all.

147
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:10,108
Well, Chris, camp is only
as fun as you make it.

148
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:12,143
That's how it was
in World War II.

149
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:14,379
Don't suppose
it would help

150
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:16,381
to say I have a note
from my doctor.

151
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:18,716
Get in there, you.

152
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,268
Hey, this one
looks cool.

153
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:21,602
Space Camp.

154
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:24,238
"Spend a week doing
intensive math and science,

155
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:25,773
learning from
real astronauts."

156
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,075
Space Camp?

157
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:28,643
I'm sorry,
that one must have

158
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:30,611
accidentally gotten in
with the rest of them.

159
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:33,014
What are you saying?
That I'm too stupid for it?

160
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:34,132
Chris, we're over here.

161
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,383
What are you saying?

162
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,001
That I'm too
stupid for it?

163
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:38,786
No, no,
of course not.

164
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:41,022
Then this is the camp I choose.

165
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:43,257
Yay! I get to go
to Space Camp!

166
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,826
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

167
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,445
You guys are
the best parents ever!

168
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,647
Would you excuse
me a moment?

169
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,167
These are mine now.

170
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:54,368
Hey!

171
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,020
Oh, honey, when we
accepted those mugs,

172
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:57,555
we knew this
could happen.

173
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,733
You know, Chris,
it's not too late

174
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,501
to change your mind
about Space Camp.

175
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:10,403
Sometimes it can be
tough to fit in

176
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:11,771
with a new group
of people.

177
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,039
Yeah, I sure
had my troubles

178
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:14,975
when I got involved
with the Boy Scouts.

179
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,576
At no time were
the campers

180
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:18,678
and Mr. Griffin naked
simultaneously.

181
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:20,814
They merely engaged
in horseplay.

182
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:22,949
Did Mr. Griffin
sodomize the boys?

183
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:27,070
Mr. Griffin vehemently
denies all allegations.

184
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:28,838
Mom, I can handle
Space Camp.

185
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:30,373
I'm not stupid.

186
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,808
Well, regardless,
on the way back,

187
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:34,277
we're stopping at that Down
syndrome camp we passed.

188
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:36,546
Peter, that was
the University of Florida.

189
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:43,503
Welcome to Space Camp.

190
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:45,839
Hi. We're here to register
our son, Chris Griffin.

191
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:47,707
Oh, great to
meet you, Chris.

192
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:49,476
Hey, this kid means
the world to me.

193
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,877
Keep an eye on him, huh?

194
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:54,180
Hey, what's that?
I thought all

195
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:55,382
the space shuttles
were decommissioned.

196
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,384
Well, we always keep one
spacecraft flight-ready

197
00:07:57,418 --> 00:07:59,119
in the event a satellite
needs service,

198
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:00,587
there's a space
station emergency

199
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,323
or an Italian guy needs
to overexaggerate.

200
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,909
I swear to God, Johnny,
I've had it up to...

201
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,934
...here with your BS.

202
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:16,903
Ooh, he's really
had it this time.

203
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:18,471
I'm sorry, Louie!

204
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:19,839
All right, then.

205
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,207
Hey, what's that
in there?

206
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:23,026
That's a sensory
deprivation room

207
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,244
that prepares
our astronauts

208
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,945
for the terrifying
emptiness of space.

209
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,213
Oh, cool.

210
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:29,849
Hey, come on, Brian,
try it with me.

211
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,038
Things got crazy
so fast.

212
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:38,274
Bye, Chris.
Good luck.

213
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,542
Take care, Chris.

214
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:42,045
Oh, and hey, if you get
sent off on a space mission,

215
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:44,481
um, don't be the black guy,
'cause you'll die.

216
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:45,982
I know you're going
to have fun

217
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:47,517
and make lots
of good friends.

218
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:48,785
Yeah, and not
fake friends,

219
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,787
like guys
whose wives are friends.

220
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:53,573
You have to get me
that recipe.

221
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,108
Oh, my God,
the cookbook?

222
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:57,410
It's right in
the kitchen.

223
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,312
Sports?
No.

224
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:01,247
Movies?
No.

225
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:03,383
Hiking?
No.

226
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,684
Cars?
No.

227
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:05,852
Porn?
Porn?

228
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:07,020
Yes!
Yes!

229
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,388
Gay porn?
No.

230
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,793
Welcome to Space Camp,
everyone.

231
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:15,528
Be sure to grab
your physics textbooks.

232
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:17,230
And you may want to brush up

233
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,299
for tomorrow's lecture
on orbital dynamics.

234
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,768
Oh, man. I don't belong here,
and they know it.

235
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:23,903
People can always sense a fraud.

236
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,772
Gentlemen, it has come
to my attention

237
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:27,507
that there's
a Chinese among us.

238
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,509
Rest assured, he will be found.

239
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,444
Security is launching
a full-scale investigation

240
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,929
into the
genealogy records

241
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,881
of every single one
of our employees.

242
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:36,332
This man will be found,

243
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,551
and there will be
dire consequences.

244
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:41,671
Too bad about
that Chinese guy, huh?

245
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:44,908
Campers, we are now in

246
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:46,643
our state-of-the-art
space shuttle simulator.

247
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:48,578
Hey, you're a girl.
I just figured that out.

248
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:50,180
By the time you
leave Space Camp,

249
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,481
you will all be familiar

250
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:53,516
with every device
on board this craft.

251
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,951
What's this button do?

252
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,920
Why don't you go
ahead and push it?

253
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:00,356
That's my band.

254
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:05,795
Okay, campers, let's see
your astronaut haircuts.

255
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,263
Mm-hmm.

256
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:09,132
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

257
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,834
Chris, that's
a Russell Brand haircut.

258
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,502
Oy, I don't know
what happened.

259
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:14,137
I went to me barber
at the shop,

260
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:15,805
and I come out,
I'm looking like this.

261
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,707
You're talking
different from how I talk.

262
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,009
Here's a bunch of money
to be on TV.

263
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,848
If you all saw <i>Apollo 13,</i>
you know they had to fix

264
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:27,383
an air scrubber with just
the tools in the capsule.

265
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,353
Griffin, I need you to use
these tools to fix my marriage.

266
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:31,621
I can't do that.

267
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:34,090
Well, I can't be
the only one who's trying.

268
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:42,415
Hello?

269
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,751
Oh, my God, Chris.
What's wrong?

270
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:46,152
Mom, I hate it here.

271
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,620
I want to come home.

272
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:48,855
All the kids are mean,

273
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,657
and I keep messing
everything up.

274
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,026
Even Jinx the Robot
is picking on me.

275
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,496
Hey, you've got
something on your shirt.

276
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,205
Joke complete.

277
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,723
You and dad were right.

278
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:08,825
I'm not smart enough
to be here.

279
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:10,860
Can you come get me,
please, Mom?

280
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:13,129
Okay, honey, of
course we will.

281
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:15,098
Hang on, I got
another call.

282
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,366
Hello?

283
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,101
Lois, I'm at the gym.

284
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,402
I hate it here.

285
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:20,870
I want to come home.

286
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:22,305
Everybody's so mean.

287
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:24,574
And there's this one guy
who follows me around

288
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:25,875
and calls me fat.

289
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,844
Well, I suppose I...

290
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:29,679
Hang on, honey, I'm
getting another call.

291
00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:30,680
Hello?

292
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:31,881
Hey, is fat ass
home yet?

293
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,600
Put him on,
I want to talk to him.

294
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:39,372
Thanks for coming
to get me, you guys.

295
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:40,540
Hey, no problem.

296
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,826
We spent thousands of dollars
to send you here

297
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,961
and made two trips
to Florida in four days.

298
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,696
I'm glad we had you.

299
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,882
Well, I'm sorry, I thought
I could handle it here,

300
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,083
but I was wrong.

301
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:52,485
That's okay, honey,
everyone makes mistakes.

302
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,321
Yeah, remember when the fat man
brought home that cougar chick?

303
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:56,890
You make yourself
comfortable, Beth.

304
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,141
I'll be right back.

305
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,309
Hi, young man.

306
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,460
I'm looking for
a good time.

307
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:01,628
Uh-huh.

308
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:03,229
I'm worldly. I'm fun.

309
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,098
This ain't mileage,
this is experience.

310
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:06,232
Not interested.

311
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,201
Listen, just so there
are no surprises,

312
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:09,769
don't be scared--
my stuff looks like

313
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:11,738
someone spilled an
apple pie in my lap.

314
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,573
Yuck.

315
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,608
Didn't you have any
fun at all, sweetie?

316
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,244
Well, I guess I did get to go
on the space shuttle everyday.

317
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,512
Really? No way.

318
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:22,315
I always wanted to be an
astronaut like Lance Armstrong.

319
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,150
It's Neil Armstrong.

320
00:12:24,184 --> 00:12:26,252
He lied about his name, too?

321
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:33,776
Wow, this
is amazing, Chris.

322
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:34,777
Look at this, Lois.

323
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:36,279
a week ago,
we call him stupid,

324
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:38,414
and now he's giving tours
of the space shuttle.

325
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,550
Negative reinforcement--
that's the key.

326
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:41,718
Right, stupid?

327
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:43,720
Ow! I'll
do better.

328
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:45,855
So, do you know how
all this stuff works?

329
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,674
Well, I don't know what
most of these buttons do,

330
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,426
but I know this big red one
is the one you press to launch.

331
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:51,728
Whoo, big red button!

332
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:52,779
Stewie, no!

333
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,301
Uh-oh.

334
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,519
Chris, make it stop.

335
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,687
I'm trying.

336
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,078
I think...
I think we're launching.

337
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:11,331
Oh, my God, everyone
strap yourselves in.

338
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:12,448
Stewie, hold my hand.

339
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:14,033
No, thank you,
I prefer to die

340
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,318
giving you the finger.

341
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,338
If this is what it takes
to get out of Florida, fine.

342
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,509
You know what,
you only live once.

343
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:25,261
I am sticking my head
out the window.

344
00:13:25,296 --> 00:13:27,931
Yes, this is the best version

345
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:30,350
of whatever's so enjoyable
about this.

346
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:37,764
Mom, I'm scared.

347
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,866
I don't believe it.

348
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,100
Are we really
stuck in space?

349
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:42,319
Oh, God, what if we
have to live up here

350
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:43,854
for the rest
of our lives?

351
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:45,389
I'm gonna miss
drinking at The Clam.

352
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:46,703
I'll tell you what I won't miss.

353
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:48,659
That waiter who thinks
he has to be funny.

354
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,477
Yes, I'd like the
chopped salad, please,

355
00:13:50,512 --> 00:13:52,279
and could I get
no onions on that?

356
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:55,148
Hmm, I've got a few connections
in the back.

357
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:56,483
I'll see what I can do.

358
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:57,618
Yeah, that's funny.

359
00:13:57,652 --> 00:13:59,286
If there's one onion
on that salad,

360
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,922
you can forget the $1.80
tip you need to live.

361
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,825
I'm sorry, you guys,
this is all my fault.

362
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:07,094
I never should've brought you
on the space shuttle.

363
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:09,530
You were right--
I am stupid.

364
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:11,765
Hello, up there.
Hello?

365
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,101
I know you all must be pretty
terrified right now,

366
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:15,569
but we're doing everything
in our power

367
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:17,271
to get you safely back to earth.

368
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:19,473
We're pretty good at this--
we're like six for eight.

369
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:21,141
Is there anything
we can do?

370
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:23,510
Well, fortunately
the ship runs on autopilot.

371
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,512
We just need some time to figure
out your coordinates,

372
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,147
and calculate the reentry plan.

373
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:29,583
So, just try to stay calm
and we'll figure this all out.

374
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:31,952
By the way,
you're all quite famous now.

375
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:33,554
You're on every news channel.

376
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:35,222
Good afternoon,
I'm Brian Williams.

377
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:38,191
Our top story, an accidental
space shuttle launch

378
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:40,761
that has sent a Rhode Island
family into orbit.

379
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:43,030
For more on the story,
we go to our local affiliate

380
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:45,566
Channel Five Quahog where
Tom Tucker is on the scene.

381
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,567
Tom?

382
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:47,768
Thanks, Brian.

383
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:49,670
I, uh, saw that you opened
my birthday Evite.

384
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:52,205
Now I just need you
to go ahead and reply.

385
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,341
I'm standing here at the home
of the Griffin family,

386
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,609
chatting with their neighbors.

387
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,277
So, the Griffins
might be dead.

388
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:58,445
How does that
make you feel?

389
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:01,131
Griffin dead?
I take.

390
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,269
No, no, they
might be dead.

391
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:06,870
They also might
still be alive.

392
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:08,872
It's okay, I-I take.

393
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:20,901
Peter, what are you doing?

394
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:22,552
I'm going out for
a space walk, Lois.

395
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,037
You know, this
is our one chance

396
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,173
to experience the
awe-inspiring wonders

397
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,924
of space firsthand.

398
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:34,131
Wow, neat.

399
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:36,166
So, this is space.

400
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:45,075
Damn it.

401
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:52,199
Ha! Stupid drunk bitches.

402
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:55,786
Hey, Brian, check it out.

403
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,554
Meg's poking
around the cargo hold.

404
00:15:57,588 --> 00:15:59,456
I'm gonna give her
a little scare.

405
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:13,487
Aw, boy, I think
this space food has gone bad.

406
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:15,238
Peter, that's a
fecal collection bag.

407
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:16,473
Oh, there's a bag for that?

408
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:18,108
'Cause mine's over there
twirling in the air

409
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:19,626
like a slow baton.

410
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:22,612
Well, someone's got to lead
this marching band. Ew!

411
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:23,864
Griffins come in.

412
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:25,632
Yes! Yes, we're here.

413
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,167
Well, I have some good news.

414
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:29,936
The autopilot is capable
of taking you home.

415
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:31,204
But guys...

416
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,673
...to engage, we're gonna...

417
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:34,207
...to take the shuttle out of...

418
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,044
Hello?

419
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:39,212
Hello?
Crap, I think we lost him.

420
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:40,547
Let me fix that.

421
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:43,133
If radio deejays have taught me
anything about radio,

422
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,468
it's that you got
to do two things.

423
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,670
Turn it up and rip the knob off.

424
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:48,455
Peter, no!

425
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,374
Damn it, now we've lost
communication entirely.

426
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:51,608
What are we gonna do?

427
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:53,226
I don't know,
but we got to try something.

428
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:54,761
If we don't get this shuttle
out of orbit soon,

429
00:16:54,795 --> 00:16:56,563
we're gonna
run out of oxygen and die.

430
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:57,714
Is failure an option?

431
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:58,899
No, it's not.

432
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:00,434
Aw, that was my suggestion.

433
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:02,169
All right, come on, everyone,
we got to put our heads

434
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:03,437
together
and try to find a solution.

435
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:05,305
Don't worry-- Griffins
have a long history

436
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,473
of figuring stuff out.

437
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:07,808
Like my great-grandfather

438
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:09,609
who invented the
first marital aid.

439
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:14,448
This gives me an idea.

440
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:18,785
She's dead.

441
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,123
All right, come on,
if mission control thought

442
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:24,491
we could help get the shuttle
out of orbit,

443
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:25,692
it can't be that hard.

444
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:27,043
Okay, okay,
uh, try this.

445
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:28,595
Hit up, up, down, down,

446
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,847
left, right, left, right,
B, A, start.

447
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,132
Then we'll have
unlimited lives.

448
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,884
Come on,
we're running out of time.

449
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:36,036
Oh, Meg, all your suicide
threats over the years,

450
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,838
and you're just as chicken
 as the rest of us.

451
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:41,725
Hey, guys, I think I have
an idea that could help us.

452
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,244
In Space Camp, we learned about
countering forward momentum

453
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:45,862
with retro rockets.

454
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:48,498
If we use them now,
the ship might slow down enough

455
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,184
for gravity
to pull us out of orbit.

456
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:54,237
That's an egg that I
hucked at you for being a nerd.

457
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:58,125
Chris, if you think it'll help,
just try it!

458
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:04,514
Ah, we're slowing down.
That's a good sign.

459
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:06,516
You know, what's not slowing
down-- <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

460
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:08,735
Haven't seen anything like it
since <i>The Wire.</i>

461
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,754
God, he never shuts up
about those shows.

462
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:11,888
Oh, my God!

463
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:13,706
I think it might be working!

464
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,876
We're spinning out!

465
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,314
Oh, my God,
we're gonna die!

466
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:22,933
There's so many things
I didn't do.

467
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:24,568
I never got to go to college!

468
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:27,154
My book wasn't all
I wanted it to be in spots!

469
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:29,389
Peter, I wanted to
grow old with you!

470
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:30,941
Well, you kind of did.

471
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:32,976
I never got to wear it better!

472
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:39,732
I have to reorient
the retro rockets

473
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,952
to counter the spin rotation!

474
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:03,423
Chris, what are you doing?

475
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:05,091
Saving our lives.

476
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:06,776
Aw, I wish he
hadn't said that.

477
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,478
Now I'm kind of
rooting against him.

478
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:13,900
We're straightening out!

479
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:17,320
Ah, look! It says
"autopilot engaged."

480
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:19,823
Good for him.
I'm glad he found someone.

481
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:21,591
Oh, thank God,
we're saved!

482
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:25,095
I can't believe I got to go
to space before Derek Watson.

483
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,496
Who's Derek Watson?

484
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,081
Nobody now.

485
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:45,565
They've re-entered
the atmosphere!

486
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:50,687
I'm not cheering.
I don't even know them.

487
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:19,549
Well, thanks to
no gravity in space,

488
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,636
my spine stretched and I am
now a confident six, three,

489
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,655
so, Lois, I will be leaving you
for a hotter woman.

490
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,425
Never mind, Lois,
I love you so much.

491
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,965
Chris, our family is alive
right now because of you.

492
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,232
You saved us.

493
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:37,417
That's right, buddy.

494
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:39,486
It was your brains
that pulled us through.

495
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,805
We're so sorry
we ever doubted you.

496
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,039
Thanks, you guys.

497
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:44,207
You bet, champ.

498
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:46,343
Hey, by the way,
who moved our house?
