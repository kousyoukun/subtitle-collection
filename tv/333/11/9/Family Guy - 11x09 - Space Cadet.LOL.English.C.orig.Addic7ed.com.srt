Chris, would you like
to read your personal essay?

6
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,040
Okay, Mrs. Donovan.

7
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:12,378
"Following Mrs. Donovan"
by Chris Griffin.

8
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:14,563
"The first thing that
Mrs. Donovan does

9
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:16,265
"when she gets
home from school

10
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:17,717
"is put on sweatpants.

11
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:20,002
"Then she eats a whole
tube of cookie dough,

12
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:21,670
"but she must be
allergic to it

13
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:23,823
"because there are tears
coming out of her eyes

14
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:25,858
"and she always
throws up right after.

15
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:27,676
"Then she puts
paper doll clothes

16
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:29,445
on a picture
of a sonogram."

17
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:30,780
Chris, I think
you should stop.

18
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:32,948
What? I'm doing
the best I can.

19
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:34,884
I'm not Nathaniel
Hawthorne.

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,671
Nathaniel,
what are you doing?

21
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:41,073
Just ruining ninth
grade for everyone.

22
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:46,178
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I called you in today

23
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:47,713
because your son, Chris,
has been getting

24
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:49,415
in quite a bit of
trouble lately.

25
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:51,934
In fact, just yesterday,
he tried to pass

26
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:55,271
this drawing off
as his Advanced Art project.

27
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:57,506
Oh, my.
I'm very embarrassed.

28
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,008
Well, someone should be.

29
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,409
I'm sorry,
Principal Shepherd.

30
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:02,344
We've tried talking
to Chris.

31
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:04,013
We just don't know
what else to do.

32
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:05,848
Well, I think we may
have a solution.

33
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:07,983
We have these cats that
hang around the school,

34
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:09,251
and we feed them.

35
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:10,553
Why doesn't
Chris come in,

36
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:12,638
and we can treat him
like one of the cats?

37
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:14,890
And in a couple of years,
we'll give him a diploma.

38
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:16,091
That doesn't
sound like

39
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:17,359
he'll be getting
the best education.

40
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:18,527
I don't know, Lois.

41
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:20,946
Some of those cats go on
to get pretty good jobs.

42
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:24,200
Yep.

43
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:29,889
We now return to <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

44
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:33,459
You will recommend
<i>Breaking Bad</i>

45
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:35,227
to everyone you know.

46
00:02:35,262 --> 00:02:38,297
I will recommend <i>Breaking Bad</i>
to everyone I know.

47
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:41,167
<i>Breaking Bad</i> is the best show
you've ever seen,

48
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,902
except maybe <i>The Wire.</i>

49
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:45,604
<i>Breaking Bad</i>
is the best show I've ever seen,

50
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,273
except maybe <i>The Wire.</i>

51
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:48,707
You will never stop talking

52
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:51,010
about <i>Breaking Bad</i>
or <i>The Wire.</i>

53
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:55,014
I will never stop talking
about <i>Breaking Bad</i> or <i>The Wire.</i>

54
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:57,099
Peter, I'm really
worried about Chris.

55
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,018
What are we going
to do about him?

56
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:01,754
What the hell happened

57
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:03,455
to all the smart genes
in this family?

58
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,307
I mean, I invent
the razor blade comb,

59
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:06,659
and my kids
are doing nothing.

60
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:08,961
I mean, when Chris grows
up, will he even be able

61
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:11,096
to get a job or take
care of himself?

62
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:13,332
And what's he going
to do when we die?

63
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:18,170
♪ Ooga chaka, ooga ooga,
ooga chaka... ♪

64
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:21,407
♪ I can't stop
this feeling ♪

65
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:25,144
♪ Deep inside
of me... ♪

66
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,779
I feel awful
saying it,

67
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:29,181
but I'm kind of embarrassed
by him sometimes.

68
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:31,083
I know, and he's
got boobs, too.

69
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,685
Stupid guy with boobs.

70
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,403
Acting like he
doesn't want us to look.

71
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:35,738
He wants us to look.

72
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:37,106
Stop making fun of me!

73
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:40,676
I just wanted to listen
to you guys have sex,

74
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,345
but you were saying
mean things about me.

75
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,647
Chris!
Oh, my God.

76
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:46,799
No, we weren't
talking about you.

77
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,384
Yeah, we were talking
about Meg.

78
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:50,286
We call her Chris
so she doesn't know.

79
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,221
you!
Shut up, Chris!

80
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:54,023
I know that's not true.

81
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:57,159
Oh, God.

82
00:03:57,193 --> 00:03:59,011
Peter, he heard us
call him stupid.

83
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:00,279
His own parents.

84
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:01,580
What have we done?

85
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:02,681
Well, you know, Lois,

86
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:03,983
it's never easy
hearing the truth.

87
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:05,801
Especially from
a fortune cookie.

88
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:11,073
What does it
say, Peter?

89
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:12,825
Uh, just something
about perseverance.

90
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,109
What does yours say?

91
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:16,011
It says I'm
very creative.

92
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:27,239
Oh, by the way, there's a baby
in my preschool with HIV,

93
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:29,074
and my teacher gave you
something to sign

94
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:30,409
to get him kicked out.

95
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:32,378
Hey, Chris!

96
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:34,346
There's my big, smart son.

97
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,348
My special guy,
my Chrissy.

98
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:39,551
Sounds like someone got her
vibrator working again.

99
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:40,953
Oh, look out, everyone.

100
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:43,289
Double-digit IQ
joining the table.

101
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:45,124
Hey, smarty, think fast.
Aah!

102
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:47,209
He knows.
He knows it's hot.

103
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,510
'Cause he's smart.

104
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:50,179
I don't want
to talk to you guys.

105
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,513
You called me
an idiot.

106
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:53,549
Oh, Chris, you must
have just misheard us.

107
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,984
I was standing
right there.

108
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,452
How is that
possible?

109
00:04:56,486 --> 00:04:57,582
'Cause you're an idiot--
that's how.

110
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:58,221
Peter!

111
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,956
I'm going
to school!

112
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:02,391
It's Sunday,
right?

113
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:05,060
Peter, we've completely
destroyed his self-esteem.

114
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,895
We've got to
do something.

115
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,814
You know, Lois, if Chris is
having confidence issues,

116
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,265
they have camps
for kids like him.

117
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,550
What do you mean?

118
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,302
Well, they take kids
who struggle in school

119
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:14,603
and help them gain
self-confidence

120
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:16,105
in a nurturing
environment.

121
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,374
Wow. That's actually
a great idea.

122
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:19,858
We don't got
no money for camp.

123
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:21,360
We're saving up
to go to Europe.

124
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:23,495
Peter, we went to Europe.
You didn't like it.

125
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,080
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

126
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:27,049
My TV isn't here.
Let's go home.

127
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,389
We now return
to <i>Canadian Horror Story.</i>

128
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:35,357
Hey, hon, we're
out of Molson.

129
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:36,625
Oh, not to worry.

130
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,327
We've got some Labatt's
in the garage.

131
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:40,095
And could you get one
for the ghost?

132
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,413
Boo, eh?

133
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,983
Hey, Chris,
could we talk to you?

134
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:46,618
If you're going to insult me
again, just go away.

135
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:48,220
Look, honey, we're sorry,

136
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:50,122
and we want to do
something special for you.

137
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:51,396
This is a Hamilton
Beach blender

138
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:52,708
we got on our
wedding day.

139
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:54,009
It keeps coming
back to us

140
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:55,177
in a vicious
regifting cycle.

141
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:56,512
No, Peter.

142
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:58,414
Chris, we were thinking
of sending you to camp.

143
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:01,333
And we're going to let
you choose which one.

144
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:03,335
This one's called
Camp Helmet.

145
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,738
This one's called
Camp Sit 'N' Stay.

146
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:07,773
These camps
don't sound fun at all.

147
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:10,109
Well, Chris, camp is only
as fun as you make it.

148
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:12,144
That's how it was
in World War II.

149
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:14,380
Don't suppose
it would help

150
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:16,382
to say I have a note
from my doctor.

151
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,717
Get in there, you.

152
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,269
Hey, this one
looks cool.

153
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:21,603
Space Camp.

154
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:24,239
"Spend a week doing
intensive math and science,

155
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:25,774
learning from
real astronauts."

156
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:27,076
Space Camp?

157
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,644
I'm sorry,
that one must have

158
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:30,612
accidentally gotten in
with the rest of them.

159
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:33,015
What are you saying?
That I'm too stupid for it?

160
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,133
Chris, we're over here.

161
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,384
What are you saying?

162
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:37,002
That I'm too
stupid for it?

163
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:38,787
No, no,
of course not.

164
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:41,023
Then this is the camp I choose.

165
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:43,258
Yay! I get to go
to Space Camp!

166
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:44,827
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

167
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:47,446
You guys are
the best parents ever!

168
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,648
Would you excuse
me a moment?

169
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,168
These are mine now.

170
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,369
Hey!

171
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:56,021
Oh, honey, when we
accepted those mugs,

172
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:57,556
we knew this
could happen.

173
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,734
You know, Chris,
it's not too late

174
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:08,502
to change your mind
about Space Camp.

175
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:10,404
Sometimes it can be
tough to fit in

176
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,772
with a new group
of people.

177
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,040
Yeah, I sure
had my troubles

178
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,976
when I got involved
with the Boy Scouts.

179
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,577
At no time were
the campers

180
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:18,679
and Mr. Griffin naked
simultaneously.

181
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:20,815
They merely engaged
in horseplay.

182
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:22,950
Did Mr. Griffin
sodomize the boys?

183
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:27,071
Mr. Griffin vehemently
denies all allegations.

184
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:28,839
Mom, I can handle
Space Camp.

185
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:30,374
I'm not stupid.

186
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,809
Well, regardless,
on the way back,

187
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:34,278
we're stopping at that Down
syndrome camp we passed.

188
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:36,547
Peter, that was
the University of Florida.

189
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,504
Welcome to Space Camp.

190
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,840
Hi. We're here to register
our son, Chris Griffin.

191
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,708
Oh, great to
meet you, Chris.

192
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:49,477
Hey, this kid means
the world to me.

193
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,878
Keep an eye on him, huh?

194
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:54,181
Hey, what's that?
I thought all

195
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,383
the space shuttles
were decommissioned.

196
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,385
Well, we always keep one
spacecraft flight-ready

197
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,120
in the event a satellite
needs service,

198
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,588
there's a space
station emergency

199
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:03,324
or an Italian guy needs
to overexaggerate.

200
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,910
I swear to God, Johnny,
I've had it up to...

201
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,935
...here with your BS.

202
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,904
Ooh, he's really
had it this time.

203
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:18,472
I'm sorry, Louie!

204
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:19,840
All right, then.

205
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,208
Hey, what's that
in there?

206
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,027
That's a sensory
deprivation room

207
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,245
that prepares
our astronauts

208
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,946
for the terrifying
emptiness of space.

209
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:27,214
Oh, cool.

210
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:29,850
Hey, come on, Brian,
try it with me.

211
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:35,039
Things got crazy
so fast.

212
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:38,275
Bye, Chris.
Good luck.

213
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,543
Take care, Chris.

214
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:42,046
Oh, and hey, if you get
sent off on a space mission,

215
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,482
um, don't be the black guy,
'cause you'll die.

216
00:08:44,516 --> 00:08:45,983
I know you're going
to have fun

217
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:47,518
and make lots
of good friends.

218
00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:48,786
Yeah, and not
fake friends,

219
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,788
like guys
whose wives are friends.

220
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:53,574
You have to get me
that recipe.

221
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:55,109
Oh, my God,
the cookbook?

222
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:57,411
It's right in
the kitchen.

223
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:59,313
Sports?
No.

224
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:01,248
Movies?
No.

225
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:03,384
Hiking?
No.

226
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,685
Cars?
No.

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,853
Porn?
Porn?

228
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:07,021
Yes!
Yes!

229
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:08,389
Gay porn?
No.

230
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,794
Welcome to Space Camp,
everyone.

231
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,529
Be sure to grab
your physics textbooks.

232
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:17,231
And you may want to brush up

233
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,300
for tomorrow's lecture
on orbital dynamics.

234
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,769
Oh, man. I don't belong here,
and they know it.

235
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:23,904
People can always sense a fraud.

236
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,773
Gentlemen, it has come
to my attention

237
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:27,508
that there's
a Chinese among us.

238
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,510
Rest assured, he will be found.

239
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:31,445
Security is launching
a full-scale investigation

240
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,930
into the
genealogy records

241
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:34,882
of every single one
of our employees.

242
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,333
This man will be found,

243
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,552
and there will be
dire consequences.

244
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:41,672
Too bad about
that Chinese guy, huh?

245
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,909
Campers, we are now in

246
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,644
our state-of-the-art
space shuttle simulator.

247
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:48,579
Hey, you're a girl.
I just figured that out.

248
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,181
By the time you
leave Space Camp,

249
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,482
you will all be familiar

250
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:53,517
with every device
on board this craft.

251
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,952
What's this button do?

252
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,921
Why don't you go
ahead and push it?

253
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:00,357
That's my band.

254
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:05,796
Okay, campers, let's see
your astronaut haircuts.

255
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:07,264
Mm-hmm.

256
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:09,133
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

257
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,835
Chris, that's
a Russell Brand haircut.

258
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,503
Oy, I don't know
what happened.

259
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:14,138
I went to me barber
at the shop,

260
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,806
and I come out,
I'm looking like this.

261
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:17,708
You're talking
different from how I talk.

262
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,010
Here's a bunch of money
to be on TV.

263
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:24,849
If you all saw <i>Apollo 13,</i>
you know they had to fix

264
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:27,384
an air scrubber with just
the tools in the capsule.

265
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,354
Griffin, I need you to use
these tools to fix my marriage.

266
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:31,622
I can't do that.

267
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:34,091
Well, I can't be
the only one who's trying.

268
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:42,416
Hello?

269
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:44,752
Oh, my God, Chris.
What's wrong?

270
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:46,153
Mom, I hate it here.

271
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,621
I want to come home.

272
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:48,856
All the kids are mean,

273
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,658
and I keep messing
everything up.

274
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,027
Even Jinx the Robot
is picking on me.

275
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:56,497
Hey, you've got
something on your shirt.

276
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:05,206
Joke complete.

277
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,724
You and dad were right.

278
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:08,826
I'm not smart enough
to be here.

279
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,861
Can you come get me,
please, Mom?

280
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:13,130
Okay, honey, of
course we will.

281
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:15,099
Hang on, I got
another call.

282
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,367
Hello?

283
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:18,102
Lois, I'm at the gym.

284
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,403
I hate it here.

285
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:20,871
I want to come home.

286
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:22,306
Everybody's so mean.

287
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,575
And there's this one guy
who follows me around

288
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:25,876
and calls me fat.

289
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:27,845
Well, I suppose I...

290
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,680
Hang on, honey, I'm
getting another call.

291
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:30,681
Hello?

292
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:31,882
Hey, is fat ass
home yet?

293
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,601
Put him on,
I want to talk to him.

294
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:39,373
Thanks for coming
to get me, you guys.

295
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,541
Hey, no problem.

296
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,827
We spent thousands of dollars
to send you here

297
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:44,962
and made two trips
to Florida in four days.

298
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,697
I'm glad we had you.

299
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:48,883
Well, I'm sorry, I thought
I could handle it here,

300
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,084
but I was wrong.

301
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:52,486
That's okay, honey,
everyone makes mistakes.

302
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:55,322
Yeah, remember when the fat man
brought home that cougar chick?

303
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:56,891
You make yourself
comfortable, Beth.

304
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,142
I'll be right back.

305
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,310
Hi, young man.

306
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,461
I'm looking for
a good time.

307
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:01,629
Uh-huh.

308
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,230
I'm worldly. I'm fun.

309
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,099
This ain't mileage,
this is experience.

310
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,233
Not interested.

311
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,202
Listen, just so there
are no surprises,

312
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:09,770
don't be scared--
my stuff looks like

313
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:11,739
someone spilled an
apple pie in my lap.

314
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,574
Yuck.

315
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,609
Didn't you have any
fun at all, sweetie?

316
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,245
Well, I guess I did get to go
on the space shuttle everyday.

317
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,513
Really? No way.

318
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:22,316
I always wanted to be an
astronaut like Lance Armstrong.

319
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,151
It's Neil Armstrong.

320
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:26,253
He lied about his name, too?

321
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:33,777
Wow, this
is amazing, Chris.

322
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:34,778
Look at this, Lois.

323
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:36,280
a week ago,
we call him stupid,

324
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:38,415
and now he's giving tours
of the space shuttle.

325
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,551
Negative reinforcement--
that's the key.

326
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:41,719
Right, stupid?

327
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,721
Ow! I'll
do better.

328
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:45,856
So, do you know how
all this stuff works?

329
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,675
Well, I don't know what
most of these buttons do,

330
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:50,427
but I know this big red one
is the one you press to launch.

331
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:51,729
Whoo, big red button!

332
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:52,780
Stewie, no!

333
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,302
Uh-oh.

334
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,520
Chris, make it stop.

335
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,688
I'm trying.

336
00:13:06,861 --> 00:13:09,079
I think...
I think we're launching.

337
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:11,332
Oh, my God, everyone
strap yourselves in.

338
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:12,449
Stewie, hold my hand.

339
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,034
No, thank you,
I prefer to die

340
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,319
giving you the finger.

341
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,339
If this is what it takes
to get out of Florida, fine.

342
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,510
You know what,
you only live once.

343
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:25,262
I am sticking my head
out the window.

344
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:27,932
Yes, this is the best version

345
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:30,351
of whatever's so enjoyable
about this.

346
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:37,765
Mom, I'm scared.

347
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,867
I don't believe it.

348
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,101
Are we really
stuck in space?

349
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:42,320
Oh, God, what if we
have to live up here

350
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,855
for the rest
of our lives?

351
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,390
I'm gonna miss
drinking at The Clam.

352
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,704
I'll tell you what I won't miss.

353
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,660
That waiter who thinks
he has to be funny.

354
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,478
Yes, I'd like the
chopped salad, please,

355
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:52,280
and could I get
no onions on that?

356
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:55,149
Hmm, I've got a few connections
in the back.

357
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:56,484
I'll see what I can do.

358
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,619
Yeah, that's funny.

359
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:59,287
If there's one onion
on that salad,

360
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,923
you can forget the $1.80
tip you need to live.

361
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:04,826
I'm sorry, you guys,
this is all my fault.

362
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,095
I never should've brought you
on the space shuttle.

363
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,531
You were right--
I am stupid.

364
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,766
Hello, up there.
Hello?

365
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,102
I know you all must be pretty
terrified right now,

366
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,570
but we're doing everything
in our power

367
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,272
to get you safely back to earth.

368
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,474
We're pretty good at this--
we're like six for eight.

369
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:21,142
Is there anything
we can do?

370
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:23,511
Well, fortunately
the ship runs on autopilot.

371
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:25,513
We just need some time to figure
out your coordinates,

372
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,148
and calculate the reentry plan.

373
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:29,584
So, just try to stay calm
and we'll figure this all out.

374
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,953
By the way,
you're all quite famous now.

375
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:33,555
You're on every news channel.

376
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:35,223
Good afternoon,
I'm Brian Williams.

377
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:38,192
Our top story, an accidental
space shuttle launch

378
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:40,762
that has sent a Rhode Island
family into orbit.

379
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,031
For more on the story,
we go to our local affiliate

380
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,567
Channel Five Quahog where
Tom Tucker is on the scene.

381
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:46,568
Tom?

382
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:47,769
Thanks, Brian.

383
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,671
I, uh, saw that you opened
my birthday Evite.

384
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,206
Now I just need you
to go ahead and reply.

385
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:54,342
I'm standing here at the home
of the Griffin family,

386
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:55,610
chatting with their neighbors.

387
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,278
So, the Griffins
might be dead.

388
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,446
How does that
make you feel?

389
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,132
Griffin dead?
I take.

390
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,270
No, no, they
might be dead.

391
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,871
They also might
still be alive.

392
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,873
It's okay, I-I take.

393
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,902
Peter, what are you doing?

394
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,553
I'm going out for
a space walk, Lois.

395
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,038
You know, this
is our one chance

396
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,174
to experience the
awe-inspiring wonders

397
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,925
of space firsthand.

398
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,132
Wow, neat.

399
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,167
So, this is space.

400
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:45,076
Damn it.

401
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:52,200
Ha! Stupid drunk bitches.

402
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,787
Hey, Brian, check it out.

403
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,555
Meg's poking
around the cargo hold.

404
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,457
I'm gonna give her
a little scare.

405
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:13,488
Aw, boy, I think
this space food has gone bad.

406
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,239
Peter, that's a
fecal collection bag.

407
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,474
Oh, there's a bag for that?

408
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:18,109
'Cause mine's over there
twirling in the air

409
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,627
like a slow baton.

410
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:22,613
Well, someone's got to lead
this marching band. Ew!

411
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,865
Griffins come in.

412
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,633
Yes! Yes, we're here.

413
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,168
Well, I have some good news.

414
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:29,937
The autopilot is capable
of taking you home.

415
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:31,205
But guys...

416
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,674
...to engage, we're gonna...

417
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,208
...to take the shuttle out of...

418
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,045
Hello?

419
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,213
Hello?
Crap, I think we lost him.

420
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,548
Let me fix that.

421
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,134
If radio deejays have taught me
anything about radio,

422
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,469
it's that you got
to do two things.

423
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,671
Turn it up and rip the knob off.

424
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:48,456
Peter, no!
(crackling)

425
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,375
Damn it, now we've lost
communication entirely.

426
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,609
What are we gonna do?

427
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,227
I don't know,
but we got to try something.

428
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,762
If we don't get this shuttle
out of orbit soon,

429
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:56,564
we're gonna
run out of oxygen and die.

430
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,715
Is failure an option?

431
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,900
No, it's not.

432
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,435
Aw, that was my suggestion.

433
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,170
All right, come on, everyone,
we got to put our heads

434
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:03,438
together
and try to find a solution.

435
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:05,306
Don't worry-- Griffins
have a long history

436
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,474
of figuring stuff out.

437
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:07,809
Like my great-grandfather

438
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,610
who invented the
first marital aid.

439
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:14,449
This gives me an idea.

440
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,786
She's dead.

441
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:23,124
All right, come on,
if mission control thought

442
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:24,492
we could help get the shuttle
out of orbit,

443
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,693
it can't be that hard.

444
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:27,044
Okay, okay,
uh, try this.

445
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,596
Hit up, up, down, down,

446
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,848
left, right, left, right,
B, A, start.

447
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,133
Then we'll have
unlimited lives.

448
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,885
Come on,
we're running out of time.

449
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:36,037
Oh, Meg, all your suicide
threats over the years,

450
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:38,839
and you're just as chicken
 as the rest of us.

451
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,726
Hey, guys, I think I have
an idea that could help us.

452
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,245
In Space Camp, we learned about
countering forward momentum

453
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,863
with retro rockets.

454
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,499
If we use them now,
the ship might slow down enough

455
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,185
for gravity
to pull us out of orbit.

456
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,238
That's an egg that I
hucked at you for being a nerd.

457
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,126
Chris, if you think it'll help,
just try it!

458
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,515
Ah, we're slowing down.
That's a good sign.

459
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,517
You know, what's not slowing
down-- <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

460
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,736
Haven't seen anything like it
since <i>The Wire.</i>

461
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,755
God, he never shuts up
about those shows.

462
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,889
Oh, my God!

463
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,707
I think it might be working!

464
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,877
We're spinning out!

465
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,315
MEG: Oh, my God,
we're gonna die!

466
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,934
There's so many things
I didn't do.

467
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:24,569
I never got to go to college!

468
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,155
My book wasn't all
I wanted it to be in spots!

469
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,390
Peter, I wanted to
grow old with you!

470
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,942
Well, you kind of did.

471
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:32,977
I never got to wear it better!

472
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,733
I have to reorient
the retro rockets

473
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,953
to counter the spin rotation!

474
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,424
Chris, what are you doing?

475
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,092
Saving our lives.

476
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,777
Aw, I wish he
hadn't said that.

477
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,479
Now I'm kind of
rooting against him.

478
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,901
We're straightening out!

479
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:17,321
Ah, look! It says
"autopilot engaged."

480
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:19,824
Good for him.
I'm glad he found someone.

481
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,592
Oh, thank God,
we're saved!

482
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,096
I can't believe I got to go
to space before Derek Watson.

483
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,497
Who's Derek Watson?

484
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,082
Nobody now.

485
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:45,566
They've re-entered
the atmosphere!

486
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:50,688
I'm not cheering.
I don't even know them.

487
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,550
Well, thanks to
no gravity in space,

488
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,637
my spine stretched and I am
now a confident six, three,

489
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,656
so, Lois, I will be leaving you
for a hotter woman.

490
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,426
Never mind, Lois,
I love you so much.

491
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,966
Chris, our family is alive
right now because of you.

492
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,233
You saved us.

493
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,418
That's right, buddy.

494
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,487
It was your brains
that pulled us through.

495
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:41,806
We're so sorry
we ever doubted you.

496
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,040
Thanks, you guys.

497
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,208
You bet, champ.

498
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,344
Hey, by the way,
who moved our house?

499
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:51,378
