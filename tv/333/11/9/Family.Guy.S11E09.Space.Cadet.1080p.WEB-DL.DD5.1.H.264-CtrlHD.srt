我想回家
I want to come home.

282
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,650
所有孩子都很坏
All the kids are mean,

283
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,450
而且我任何事都做不好
and I keep messing everything up.

284
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,820
就连机器人Jinx也捉弄我
Even Jinx the Robot is picking on me.

285
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,820
电影"太空险航"(Space Camp)中的角色

286
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,290
嘿 你衣服上有东西
Hey, you've got something on your shirt.

287
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,000
玩笑达成
Joke complete.

288
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,520
你和爸是对的
You and dad were right.

289
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,620
我太笨不适合这里
I'm not smart enough to be here.

290
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,660
你能来接我吗 求你了 妈

说我胖
and calls me fat.

300
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,640
呃 我想我...
Well, I suppose I...

301
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,480
等下 宝贝 又有电话进来

Hello?

303
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,680
嘿 死胖子回家了没

谢谢你们来接我
Thanks for coming to get me, you guys.

306

嘿 没问题的
Hey, no problem.

307
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,620
我们花了上万元送你来这儿
We spent thousands of dollars to send you here

308
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,760
然后4天里来了两趟佛罗里达
and made two trips to Florida in four days.

309
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,490
我很高兴我们生了你
I'm glad we had you.

310
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,680

Well, I'm sorry, I thought I could handle it here,

311
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,880
但我错了
but I was wrong.

312
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,280
没关系 宝贝 人人都会犯错
That's okay, honey, everyone makes mistakes.

313
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,120
是啊 还记得胖子带回家的那个熟女小妞么
Yeah, remember when the fat man brought home that cougar chick?

314
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,690
请随意 Beth
You make yourself comfortable, Beth.

我正想找乐子呢
I'm looking for a good time.

318
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,420
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

319
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,030
我很老练 很有趣
I'm worldly. I'm fun.

320
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,890
这不是公共汽车 只是经验丰富
This ain't mileage, this is experience.

321
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,030
没兴趣
Not interested.

322
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,000
听着 就是告诉你不会有什么"惊喜"
Listen, just so there are no surprises,

323
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,570
别害怕- 我那东西看起来像
don't be scared-- my stuff looks like

324
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,530
有人在我腿间洒了个苹果派
someone spilled an apple pie in my lap.

325
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,370
恶心
Yuck.

326
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
你一点乐趣都没有么 甜心
Didn't you have any fun at all, sweetie?

327
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,040
呃 我倒是每天都上了那个航天飞机
Well, I guess I did get to go on the space shuttle everyday.

328
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,310
真的么 骗人的吧
Really? No way.

329
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,110
我一直想当个像兰斯·阿姆斯特朗一样的宇航员
I always wanted to be an astronaut like Lance Armstrong.

330
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,110
美自行车运动员

331
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,950
那是尼尔·阿姆斯特朗
It's Neil Armstrong.

332
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,050
他也用了假名么
He lied about his name, too?

333
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,570
哇 这太棒了 Chris
Wow, this is amazing, Chris.

334
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,570
看看这个 Lois
Look at this, Lois.

335
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,080
一周前 我们说他笨
a week ago, we call him stupid,

336
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,210
现在他却带我们参观太空飞船
and now he's giving tours of the space shuttle.

337
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,350
负强化 这才是关键
Negative reinforcement-- that's the key.

338
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,350
指在一个行为之后取消或减弱某种刺激 从而使某种行为出现的可能性增加

339
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,510
对不 笨蛋
Right, stupid?

340
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,520
噢 我会做得更好的
Ow! I'll do better.

341
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,650
那你知道这些东西如何运作么
So, do you know how all this stuff works?

342
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,470
那个 大部分按钮我不知道是干什么的
Well, I don't know what most of these buttons do,

343
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,220
但我知道这个红色大按钮是发射用的
but I know this big red one is the one you press to launch.

344
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,520
喔 红色大按钮
Whoo, big red button!

345
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,580
Stewie 不要
Stewie, no!

346
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,350
[发射程序启动]

347
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,100
啊哦
Uh-oh.

348
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,320
Chris 让它停下
Chris, make it stop.

349
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,480
我正在努力呢
I'm trying.

350
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,870
我想...我想我们发射了
I think... I think we're launching.

351
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,130
天啊 所有人系好自己
Oh, my God, everyone strap yourselves in.

352
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,240
Stewie 拉住我的手
Stewie, hold my hand.

353
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,830
不 谢了 我宁愿死于
No, thank you, I prefer to die

354
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,110
对你比中指
giving you the finger.

355
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,130
如果离开佛罗里达需要这样 那么好吧
If this is what it takes to get out of Florida, fine.

356
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,310
知道么 人生就只有这么一回
You know what, you only live once.

357
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,060
我要把头伸到窗外去
I am sticking my head out the window.

358
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:29,150
啊 这是这种娱乐能达到的最高境界了
Yes, this is the best version of whatever's so enjoyable about this.

359
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,560
妈 我好怕
Mom, I'm scared.

360
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,660
我不敢相信
I don't believe it.

361
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,900
我们真的被困在太空了么
Are we really stuck in space?

362
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,120
天啊 如果我们的余生都得
Oh, God, what if we have to live up here

363
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,650
住在这里该怎么办
for the rest of our lives?

364
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,190
我会想念在醉蚌喝酒的时光的
I'm gonna miss drinking at The Clam.

365
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,500
我来告诉你什么是我不会想念的
I'll tell you what I won't miss.

366
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,460
那个自己为自己很搞笑的侍者
That waiter who thinks he has to be funny.

367
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,270
是的 请给我来份总汇沙拉
Yes, I'd like the chopped salad, please,

368
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,080
还有可以不要给我放洋葱么
and could I get no onions on that?

369
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,940
嗯 我和厨房还是有点关系的
Hmm, I've got a few connections in the back.

370
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,280
我尽力而为吧
I'll see what I can do.

371
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,410
挺好笑的
Yeah, that's funny.

372
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,080
如果沙拉中有一片洋葱
If there's one onion on that salad,

373
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,720
你就别想要你赖以为生的1块8小费了
you can forget the $1.80 tip you need to live.

374
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,620
抱歉各位 都是我的错
I'm sorry, you guys, this is all my fault.

375
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,890
我不应该带你们上这宇宙飞船的
I never should've brought you on the space shuttle.

376
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,330
你们是对的-- 我是很笨
You were right-- I am stupid.

377
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,560
- 飞船上有人吗 - 喂
- Hello, up there. - Hello?

378
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,900
我知道你们现在一定都吓坏了
I know you all must be pretty terrified right now,

379
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,370
但我们正在尽一切努力
but we're doing everything in our power

380
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,070
来让你们安全的返回地球
to get you safely back to earth.

381
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,270
这个我们很在行 好比八次击球有六个安打
We're pretty good at this-- we're like six for eight.

382
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,270
指棒球的打击率

383
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,940
我们能做点什么吗
Is there anything we can do?

384
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,310
所幸飞船正在自动驾驶
Well, fortunately the ship runs on autopilot.

385
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,310
我们只需要点时间来查出你们的坐标
We just need some time to figure out your coordinates,

386
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,940
然后计算出重返地球计划
and calculate the reentry plan.

387
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,380
那么试着放轻松 我们会把一切都解决的
So, just try to stay calm and we'll figure this all out.

388
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,750
另外 你们现在都很火了
By the way, you're all quite famous now.

401
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,140
我正站在Griffin家的房子前
I'm standing here at the home of the Griffin family,

402
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,410
和他们的邻居聊天
chatting with their neighbors.

那么 Griffin一家可能会死

这样你有什么感觉
How does that make you feel?

405
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,930
Griffin死? 我要了
Griffin dead? I take.

406
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,070
不 不 他们可能会死
No, no, they might be dead.

407
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,670
他们也可能会继续活着
They also might still be alive.

408
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,670
没问题的 我要了
It's okay, I-I take.

409

我要去太空漫步一下 Lois

你知道 这是我们唯一的机会
