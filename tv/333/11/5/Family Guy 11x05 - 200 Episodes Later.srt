You're a phony.

Meg?

What do you want,
a Cleveland steamer?

9
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:21,444
All right.

10
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,479
Bringing the
good news today?

11
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:24,547
It's gonna rain!

12
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:26,081
Yes!

13
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:27,399
No...

200 Episodes Later
Original Air Date on November 11, 2012

16
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:37,968
I think at one point

17
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:39,949
I thought we would
get to 200 episodes,

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,614
and then when
we got canceled,

19
00:00:41,648 --> 00:00:44,082
I thought, "No, we won't
get to 200 episodes."

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,018
And then,
when we came back,

21
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:48,253
I thought, "Yeah, maybe
we'll get to 200 episodes."

22
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:50,656
And now, it's like,
"Oh, crap, 200 episodes."

23
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,124
I'm so proud of you.

24
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,559
Way to go, Dad.

25
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:55,327
Yeah, you're
a smart fella, Dad.

26
00:00:55,362 --> 00:00:56,946
And you're
a fart smeller, Meg.

27
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,217
Wait. We've been on
for 200 episodes?

28
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:03,552
Wow.
I'm actually almost...

29
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:06,772
What I've done is
I wanted my weight

30
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:08,757
to equal how many
episodes we have.

31
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:11,510
So I'm almost
just about at 200 pounds.

32
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:14,864
And I plan to continue
to rise with the episodes.

33
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:17,601
So if the show goes
500 episodes, I will

34
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:20,233
not be able to leave my house.

35
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:27,969
I've always found it really
funny and I was excited when

36
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:29,755
so many other people did
'cause it meant that

37
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,094
was something that we
all have in common.

38
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:32,062
We all find this funny.

39
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:34,934
This is a show
that has never tried

40
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,236
to be anything more
than something that

41
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,106
makes you laugh as often
and as loudly as possible

42
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,992
within the course
of a half hour.

43
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:48,017
== sync, corrected by elderman ==

44
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:55,437
Damn it!

45
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:57,339
Oh, my God.
Peter, are you okay?

46
00:01:57,374 --> 00:01:59,141
No! I am not okay.

47
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:00,743
Nothing about
this is okay.

48
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:03,279
Inherently, like,
in the show's DNA,

49
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:06,448
has the ability to go a lot of
different directions.

50
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:10,352
We could tell conventional family
stories that are very character driven.

51
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:11,837
I say it's four o'clock,
away with you.

52
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:13,005
Stewie!
Change it back!

53
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:15,474
No, forget it.
Jolly Farm Revue  is on.

54
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:16,976
It's the latest
indoctrinating pabulum

55
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,410
for children with
not enough to do.

56
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:21,246
Hey! Shut up.

57
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:21,297
And also, you could tell
buddy comedy.

58
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:24,683
You could do
buddy comedy episodes

59
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:26,635
with Peter and Quagmire
and Joe.

60
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,588
Would you rather get
a massage from a man

61
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:32,424
or a surgery from
a female doctor?

62
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,344
Wow!

63
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:38,648
An then beyond that, Stewie's got
this sort of scientific bent, where

64
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:42,167
it opens the door
to tell all kinds of sci-fi stories.

65
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:44,837
Da Vinci must be
my ancestor.

66
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:45,904
Good Lord!

67
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,840
That's who Bertram's
here to kill.

68
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:49,808
So, that means
you're Italian.

69
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:52,745
Of course, my love for SpaghettiOs
and smoking on the toilet.

70
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:53,649
It all makes sense.

71
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:58,308
You know, it really helps
having all those avenues to pursue.

72
00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:59,469
Creatively, I've always said

73
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:01,980
this is the closest I've ever
come to writing Monty Python,

74
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:04,306
where any funny idea
that you have

75
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:07,610
you can somehow fit it
into an episode of Family Guy.

76
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:10,663
It doesn't even have to serve the story
as long as it's funny enough.

77
00:03:10,697 --> 00:03:13,098
I got something for you here.
What is it?

78
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,301
I caught you
a bullfrog outside.

79
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:18,003
Poked some holes in its back
so it can breathe.

80
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:20,155
See, look at this...
Oh, boy.

81
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,508
All right, hang on,
hang on.

82
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:48,600
I also feel like this show
is unique in that...

83
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:53,205
Because it's animated we can
push boundaries a little bit further.

84
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,208
Some of the things that
our characters say,

85
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:57,710
if they were coming out
of a live actor or actress,

86
00:03:57,744 --> 00:03:59,561
would seem
sort of off-putting.

87
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:02,798
Are you telling me that you have
a problem with me being handicapped?

88
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:05,501
As a matter of fact, Joe,
yes, I think it's immoral.

89
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,137
It's a lifestyle choice
you're forcing on America.

90
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,773
We handicapped
are a proud people.

91
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:13,609
Yeah, when you're not drinking and
gambling on your reservations,

92
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,227
which we gave you.

93
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:17,930
There are things
about the show that are

94
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:20,665
maybe gratuitous.

95
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:27,206
But the show doesn't
set out to shock for shock's sake.

96
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,607
It also has to be funny.

97
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,708
Hey, what are you guys
bellyaching about?

98
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,010
Sir, we are doing all
that we can

99
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:36,587
to stop the killing of
millions of unborn babies.

100
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,014
If you have a few moments,

101
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,032
I'd like you to watch this
video presentation.

102
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:42,454
Yeah, I got a few minutes.
My wife's getting an abortion.

103
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:44,339
The "Partial Terms
of Endearment" episode,

104
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:46,742
the thing to me that's most
significant about the fact

105
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:48,794
that it couldn't air was

106
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:51,047
that it was really

107
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:54,214
the closest we've ever come
to a true modern day

108
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,068
All in the Family episode.

109
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:58,721
It's a women's responsibility
to carry it to term.

110
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:00,222
Well, what if
a woman is raped?

111
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,558
Maybe she should have thought of
that before she asked me for directions.

112
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:04,660
Huh?
What about incest, Peter?

113
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:05,861
What's incest?

114
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:08,614
You know how cousin Lou
has that kid whose eyes touch.

115
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:11,250
So what, you're saying
Touch Eyes doesn't deserve to exist?

116
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:13,118
Well, you don't mind him
when you want a needle threaded.

117
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:16,054
I'm just saying that they should
have at least have the option.

118
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,239
How can you say that?

119
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:19,908
Think of all the love he's given
to Uncle Mom and Aunt Dad.

120
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:21,093
Okay, this argument
isn't working.

121
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,061
Peter, what if
carrying the baby to term

122
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:24,396
would endanger
the mother's life?

123
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,365
I don't know what seven of
those words were.

124
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,066
What if you look
at the ultrasound

125
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:31,303
and see that the baby is going
to be born with no arms and no legs?

126
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:32,538
You name it Mat.

127
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:36,675
Even in our crazy venue,
which is  Family Guy,

128
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:40,345
we felt we'd brought, you know,
a relatively balanced

129
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:42,314
and sort of
intelligent discussion

130
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:44,399
of a very, very
difficult subject.

131
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:46,969
That episode was not
controversial at all.

132
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:49,204
It's just like "When You Wish
Upon a Weinstein,"

133
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,757
was an episode they felt
that it was too controversial.

134
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,041
And it's not at all.

135
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:55,861
It's, you know...
It's one of the nicer episodes actually.

136
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:59,081
Max, Max, Max,
let's not deny our heritages.

137
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:01,116
You're Jewish,
you're good with money.

138
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:03,535
I'm Irish, I drink
and I ban homosexuals

139
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,220
from marching
in my parade.

140
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:12,510
This is a story
of love and loss,

141
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:13,845
fathers and sons,

142
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,315
and the foresight to retain international
merchandizing rights.

143
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:20,651
This is the story
of  Star Wars.

144
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:25,923
We had done a number of Star Wars
gags on the show and, uh...

145
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,544
They were so frequent
that Fox Legal said to us,

146
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:31,462
"If you're gonna keep
doing these

147
00:06:31,513 --> 00:06:34,182
"we have to get clearance
from Lucasfilm

148
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:37,535
"because there's just no way
we're not going to get sued."

149
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,655
This will keep you warm
until I get the shelter built.

150
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:45,126
You're sure
this is okay?

151
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,944
Yeah, you're just
cutting into the fat.

152
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:48,946
And we said, "Ah, well, God,
that's the end of it."

153
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:51,032
You know, "We're not
going to be able to do these anymore."

154
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,568
And Lucasfilm surprised us
by saying,

155
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:55,336
"Yeah, no,
we like this."

156
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,638
What started
as a small idea became

157
00:06:57,673 --> 00:07:02,109
a one hour parody of Star Wars
that Alex Sulkin wrote.

158
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:03,444
Beep boop beep.

159
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:06,130
He says there are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

160
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,481
That's not
what I said.

161
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:10,318
I said there ain't
a pack of menthols on this planet.

162
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:13,655
I'm a huge Star Wars fan
from way back as a kid,

163
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,655
as many of us are.

164
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:17,225
Okay, so the door's going to open and
you guys say, "Freeze,"

165
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,492
and point your guns
at 'em.

166
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,361
Or, you know...
Or should it just be me?

167
00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:22,046
Yeah, you know what,
I think that'd be better.

168
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:24,198
Get out, go, go, go.
Just me.

169
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:26,851
Oh, I wasn't ready...
Hi!

170
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:30,571
Those were very fun
for me to work on.

171
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:33,491
Knowing every line
of those movies inside and out,

172
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:36,310
it was fun to kind of
go through it and make fun of it.

173
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:40,414
You know, tell the jokes
that you'd always think of saying.

174
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:43,050
Where am I?
Jabba's Palace.

175
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:44,619
Who are you?

176
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,404
Someone who loves you.

177
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:48,940
Whoa, you are smothering me
and I need my space.

178
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:52,643
Some of my favorite gags
from the series

179
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,178
come out of some
of those episodes.

180
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,515
I love in the first
Star Wars episode

181
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,433
when they're
in the trash compactor

182
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,269
and Peter finds
an old ratty couch.

183
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:04,021
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

184
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:05,106
What? What? What?

185
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:06,641
What?
No, no, no, twist it.

186
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:07,992
I am.
No, no, no, no.

187
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:09,727
No, no, no, other way.
You're twisting it the wrong way.

188
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,329
Which way?
What do you want me to do?

189
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:13,598
Just look down, all right?
Just look at me, look what I'm doing.

190
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:14,932
Yeah.
All right, see the way I'm twisting it?

191
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,601
Yeah.
All right, turn it that way from your end.

192
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:17,802
Okay.
Okay, just...

193
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:19,854
No, no, no, no...
What?

194
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:21,238
All right, hey,
just put it down.

195
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,823
Put it down,
just drop it. All right.

196
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,826
We were able to use
all that great John Williams music.

197
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:30,998
I mean, they really gave us
the tools to do this right, and...

198
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:34,535
And it was because
they trusted us.

199
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:37,622
They knew that we were fans and
that we weren't gonna...

200
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:42,093
We weren't gonna
destroy their property.

201
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:48,749
I say, Brian, look, three rows down.
What?

202
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:50,451
Is that Tom Bosley?

203
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:53,471
What would Tom Bosley
be doing on a train in Switzerland?

204
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:55,022
I'm almost certain.

205
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:56,273
Tom!

206
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,209
Did he look?
I don't know.

207
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,311
Well, if I yell,
you have to watch.

208
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:01,779
Tom Bosley!

209
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:03,481
No, it's not him.
Huh.

210
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:04,732
The Road shows have been
a lot of fun.

211
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:08,602
We started with
"Road to Rhode Island" in season one.

212
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:12,390
And, uh, Seth had this idea
to do an episode

213
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:15,676
based on those Bob Hope,
Bing Crosby Road shows.

214
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:18,879
Seth, as you probably know,
loves Bob Hope.

215
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:21,999
And, you know,
is very familiar with those movies

216
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,135
and the music from
those movies and...

217
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:26,637
So, I think that
having "Road to..."

218
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:28,122
with Brian and Stewie,

219
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,892
they're sort of our
Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.

220
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:35,596
Up until that point Stewie had
kind of existed in his own world.

221
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,867
He would talk to Rupert
and hatch diabolical schemes.

222
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:43,254
And Brian meanwhile was
kind of Peter's sidekick.

223
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,738
And they were
kind of separate.

224
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:47,043
And this was the first time
we kind of paired those two,

225
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:49,068
and it just clicked.

226
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:51,495
Okay, if everything
worked properly

227
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,699
this should be the exact time and place
that Mort was sent to.

228
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,367
Now, we've just got to
figure out where we are.

229
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:57,735
Or when we are.

230
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,671
Oh, that's such a douche
time traveler thing to say.

231
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:02,473
From that point forward
we started

232
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:04,558
pairing Stewie and Brian
together on stories,

233
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:06,160
'cause they were
so good together.

234
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:09,396
And it's a perfect example
of how you can

235
00:10:09,414 --> 00:10:11,398
create a show and then

236
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,568
your writing style...
Other people coming in,

237
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:16,337
in this case,
the writing staff,

238
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:19,740
can find things in your characters that
you didn't see initially.

239
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:23,344
The Brian-Stewie relationship
which now seems so obvious

240
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:25,535
was not something
that I thought of when

241
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
I was creating the show.

242
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:31,368
They're always sort of
busting each other's chops

243
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,073
and, uh, antagonistic
towards each other,

244
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:35,456
but they're also...

245
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:38,075
I think they've evolved
into their best friends.

246
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:40,761
Can I just say before...
Can we just like take two...

247
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:43,364
I love...
You're so brave.

248
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:45,416
I just love how brave
you're being right now.

249
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,301
This is like the closest
I've ever felt to you.

250
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:49,870
Okay. Oh, my God,
I was thinking the same thing.

251
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:52,273
We are so us
right now.

252
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:53,340
Do you know that?

253
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:55,342
And the Brian-Stewie episode,

254
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:58,913
more than anything,
we did to explore whether or not

255
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:02,867
two animated characters

256
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:07,922
with just a single room
can sustain a half hour

257
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,040
purely on the strength
of their characters.

258
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,711
We thought that it might be
interesting to try an episode

259
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:16,247
where it was almost
like watching a play.

260
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:20,551
Where it was one location,
two people on stage,

261
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:24,939
no cutaways, nothing, just dialogue
for 22 minutes.

262
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,173
It was very polarizing.

263
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:28,442
People either loved it
or they hated it.

264
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:30,010
They thought
it was revolutionary,

265
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:31,862
or they thought
it was just...

266
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:35,132
You know, they couldn't get past
the Stewie diaper thing.

267
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,035
Look!

268
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,941
He's dead.

269
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:45,276
Oh, my God.

270
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,560
Nice.

271
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:49,430
"And Then There Were Fewer"
was our first 16x9 episode,

272
00:11:49,464 --> 00:11:52,633
when we went from
this to this.

273
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:58,355
And, um, we thought we'd do this big
splashy visual episode.

274
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,908
I love that episode
because it's the first time

275
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:03,577
we've really told
a story that complex.

276
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:07,548
So James Woods murdered
Stephanie and then he murdered himself.

277
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:08,849
Criss-cross.

278
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,936
The animators
did an amazing job.

279
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:13,604
The artists
and the directors

280
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:15,272
and everybody
that worked on that.

281
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:18,409
It looks so great
to watch

282
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:20,661
and the score
is amazing.

283
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:23,330
It's just a lush score
all the way throughout.

284
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,466
We use anywhere
from a 50 to,

285
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,702
in some cases, a 90-piece
orchestra for every episode of the show.

286
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:31,722
Even if people don't know that what
they're hearing is live music,

287
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:32,857
is a live orchestra,

288
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:36,327
on a subconscious level
it classes up the show.

289
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,534
I know that it happens to be one of
Seth's favorite episodes to this day.

290
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:48,038
And I think he really
liked approaching it like a movie.

291
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,974
Mr. Peter.

292
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:51,609
Mr. Joe.

293
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,943
Mr. Bonnie.

294
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:55,095
She doesn't know
what "mister" means.

295
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,564
Mr. Mort.

296
00:12:56,598 --> 00:12:58,198
Mr. Muriel.

297
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,301
Mayor West Mister.

298
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:01,735

00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,934
We do a lot of musical numbers
in Family Guy.

311
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,169
Which is fun for us.
Seth is a big music fan.

312
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:55,039
And he's very skilled
at executing them.

313
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:57,258
♪ Now a woman who'll kiss

♪ She's his Shipoopi

321
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:12,256
Shipoopi
was so elaborately choreographed

322
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,791
and then the visuals,

323
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:18,629
which Dan Povenmire, the director, spent
a ton of time working on,

324
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:22,483
really hit every point
in the orchestration.

325
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:26,470
And the thing that I've always
loved about the show is...

326
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:29,640
When I talk to my son
and his friends, you know,

327
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:32,593
they don't know
what  Shipoopi  is.

328
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:36,380
They might not know,
you know, who Gene Kelly was,

329
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,266
but they're loving the musical,
you know, segments.

330
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:42,920
And it's like,
how did Seth make

331
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:45,823

336
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:04,742
Our season seven premiere was
an episode called "Road to the Multiverse."

337
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,344
And there's this great
musical number called

338
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:08,095
It's A Wonderful Day
for Pie,

339
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,132
which is, you know,
as devoid of content as it sounds.

340
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:14,301
It's just about Peter and Lois
singing about how much they love pie.

341
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:16,721
But the animation
in that sequence is amazing.

342
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:21,542
Visually, it was just fantastic to
see our characters

343
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:23,344
animated
in a Disney style.

344
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:25,029
I just thought
that was so well done.

345
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:26,614
And it was
a lot of fun.

346
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:28,282
Uh, and we
sort of improvised

347
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,202
some of the lyrics
in the room.

348
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:32,336
Seth just came out with...

349
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:35,706
♪ It's a wonderful

00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:43,914
It was Cleveland as a skunk
and it just came together.

353
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:47,334
And, uh, that was a great piece.
One of my favorites.

354
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:49,103

The  Down's Syndrome Girl  song
was fun for me because

361
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:10,558
it was the first time
I had written lyrics and a tune.

362
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:13,260
Which I basically went in
and sang for Walter Murphy

363
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:16,764
who then arranged it
and actually made it >sound good.

364
00:16:16,882 --> 00:16:18,165
It's a lot of fun
for us to...

365
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:22,253
You know, to write a song lyric
and have a great composer

366
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:25,122
like Walter Murphy
or Ron Jones set it to music.

371
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:38,052
When we did our
Christmas episode,

372
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:41,105
I had originally envisioned
something like  Rudolph

373
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:44,191
that had, like, four or five, six
musical numbers in it.

374
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:46,143
We ended up, like,
doing two or three.

375
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:50,030
And I had written
this lyric about how...

376
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:53,317
I was making a comment
on how crazy Christmas has become

377
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:55,102
and what it takes
out of us all.

378
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:58,088
And when the smoke cleared,
it was a success.

379
00:16:58,122 --> 00:17:00,257
And we were nominated
for an Emmy.

380
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,860
But also, a great
unexpected thrill was

381
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,428
we were nominated
for a Grammy.

382
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:06,463
♪ You have AIDS
♪ Yes, you have AIDS

383

♪ Not HIV
but full blown AIDS ♪

384
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:13,387
I think the first song that
the barbershop quartet did

385
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:15,356
was the  AIDS  song.

386
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:19,210
And that's a perfect example
of another reason

387
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:24,081
for using that orchestra
and trying to be so musically legit.

388
00:17:24,115 --> 00:17:26,550
Because it allows you
to get away with content

389
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,502
that you wouldn't otherwise
be able to get away with.

390
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:33,190
Yeah, talk about making a subject matter
a little more palatable.

391
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:36,096
People love the absurdity
of these guys singing such

392
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,494
an outrageous lyric,

393
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:40,214
but what Seth
appreciates about it is

394
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:43,825
how unbelievably talented
these guys are and were

395
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,640
in these pieces, musically.

396
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:48,439
It provides
a musical cushion

397
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:53,727
that prevents you from
being completely crass,

398
00:17:53,778 --> 00:17:55,629
if you're being that crass
in the first place.

404
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:12,863
like, Stewie singing
little folk songs,

405
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:16,267
Stewie making up his own,
you know, little songs,

talking about, you know,

Music and lyrics
by Stewie Griffin.

416
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:54,985
It's amazing to me
that the show has had

417
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:57,337
the cultural impact
that it has.

418
00:18:57,372 --> 00:19:00,874
For a long while, The Simpsons
was really the only show

419
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:03,443
that had broken out
in this way

420
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:07,102
and I always hoped
we would have a prayer of

421
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,066
maybe doing that as well.

422
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:10,200
And I think
we've done that.

423
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:13,070
Ah!

424
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:16,256
One of the great things
now is that we're syndicated.

425
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:18,892
So, we're on all the time.

426
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:20,861
And old people
like us now.

427
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:23,380
I have an Auntie Philly
who's 92.

428
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:24,581
She loves  Family Guy

429
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:27,884
and she won't let any of her friends
in the room when it's on

430
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,087
because old people
talk back to the television.

431
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:31,338
She wants to hear it.

432
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:32,506
- What?
- Huh?

433
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:33,740
What?
Huh?

434
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,409
What?
I forget.

435
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:38,495
I said it before,
but we're so thankful to our fans

436
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,097
for bringing the show
back from the dead,

437
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:42,249
that I almost feel like
we owe it to them

438
00:19:42,283 --> 00:19:45,702
to give 110% every day
to every episode.

439
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:48,388
I try to interact with
the fans as much as I can.

440
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:49,890
I don't know if you
can see right now,

441
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,525
but I'm actually
eight months pregnant.

442
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,126
And this is a fan's baby.

443
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,795
You get crazy when
you're pregnant.

444
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,380
I feel like if you love me
from afar then the least I

445
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:04,410
can do is love you back.

446
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:07,724
And if that means
carrying your child, so be it.

447
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:09,960
I love my fans.

448
00:20:09,994 --> 00:20:11,288
Keep digging, you know?

449
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:13,393
It feels like there's
no more stories to tell

450
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:15,886
and then we dig for a while
and something pops up that,

451
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:17,601
"Oh, we haven't done that."

452
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:21,654
What's next is, I guess,
episode 300.

453
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:23,423
And I'll have
even more gray hair

454
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,142
and bigger circles
under my eyes.

455
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,577
I'm here for
the early bird special.

456
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:30,514
A Family Guy movie
would be a logical extension.

457
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:33,734
But, with an animated show,
you can do pretty much anything.

458
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,018
There's nothing
you can't do.

459
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,320
So what is the reason
to make a movie?

460
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:39,089
Without giving
anything away,

461
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,208
I think we've hit on
the answer to that.

462
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:44,211
So when that Family Guy movie
does come around,

463
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:45,779
sufficeth to say,

464
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,167
it will be something that
is not do-able on TV.

465
00:20:54,238 --> 00:20:56,356
Sorry. It's been building up
for a while.

466
00:20:56,824 --> 00:21:00,026
I don't have a favorite
character at this point.

467
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:03,029
I'm recoding voices so much.

468
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:06,099
Hiya, pardner.
I'm a cattle rustler.

469
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,767
I rustle cattle.

470
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:09,052
Oh, that's turning out good.

471
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:10,871
I'm partial to Brian.

472
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:13,140
Brian.
Brian Steele.

473
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:15,041
Ooh, good heavens!

474
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:21,281
He's the only character that I
don't leave the booth with a sore throat.

475
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:23,450
Seems to me you should
send less time working for the paper

476
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,986
and more time working
on that novel you've been working on...

477
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,120
Ah!

478
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:32,145
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
