12
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,175
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.

13
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:40,978
This just in: Wanted fugitive,
Bobby "The Shirt" Briggs,

14
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:43,314
notorious for always wearing
shirts while committing

15
00:00:43,348 --> 00:00:45,082
his crimes,
has finally been caught

16
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:46,884
after 15 years on the lam.

17
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:48,886
A police spokesperson
was quoted as saying,

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,270
"Duh, I'm a dumb cop.

19
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:52,172
I like to give
Tom Tucker a ticket."

20
00:00:52,207 --> 00:00:53,841
I was going, like, 41.

21
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,843
Oh, my God,
I don't believe it.

22
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:58,112
They finally got that
son of a bitch, Briggs.

23
00:00:58,146 --> 00:00:59,113
You know that guy?

24
00:00:59,147 --> 00:01:00,881
You're damn right, I do.

25
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:03,784
Bobby Briggs is the one who
put me in this wheelchair.

26
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:05,386
(crying):
They got him.

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,854
They finally got him.

28
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:08,489
Geez, Joe, you okay?

29
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:11,225
(crying)

30
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:13,160
Here, use my handkerchief.

31
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:14,445
It's wet and cold.

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,046
Well, yeah,
it's my handkerchief.

33
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:17,848
I've been blowing
my nose in it all day.

34
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,050
Wait a minute, Bobby Briggs
is the one who crippled you?

35
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:21,752
You always told us
you fell off a roof

36
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:22,920
during a fight with the Grinch.

37
00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:25,122
(sighs) I lied.

38
00:01:25,156 --> 00:01:28,359
I lied because I was ashamed
of the real story:

39
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:30,828
that I let a vicious
criminal get away.

40
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:31,895
What happened?

41
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,364
Well, it was 1996.

42
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:35,282
Briggs was one of the
biggest heroin dealers

43
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:37,818
east of Providence, which is
mostly just open water,

44
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:40,904
but still, I'd been undercover,
tracking his operation

45
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:44,375
for six months and had finally
gained his confidence.

46
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:50,964
<i>I had almost</i>
<i>gathered enough evidence</i>

47
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:52,599
<i>to put Briggsaway for good,</i>

48
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:53,951
<i>but I knew a taped confession</i>

49
00:01:53,985 --> 00:01:55,386
<i>would make the case</i>
<i>a slam dunk.</i>

50
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,421
This is gonna take us
to the next level.

51
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:59,390
We're gonna be banging
so many hot chicks

52
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:01,091
with jeans up to
their navels.

53
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:03,260
Bobby Briggs, you're
really good at heroin.

54
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:05,496
How much heroin
is here, Bobby Briggs?

55
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,930
Why are you
talking like that?

56
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:08,766
Are you wearing a wire?

57
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:12,436
Oh, you're dead,
Joe Swansonson.

58
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,638
<i>My undercover name</i>
<i>was Swansonson.</i>

59
00:02:14,672 --> 00:02:15,973
Easy, Briggs.

60
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:18,375
You kill a cop,
they'll put you away forever.

61
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,145
Then get ready to spend
the rest of your life

62
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:23,680
as a lame gimp
with an annoying-voiced wife.

63
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:24,848
<i>He'd met Bonnie.</i>

64
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:27,785
(screaming in pain)

65
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:31,171
<i>Briggs got away,</i>

66
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:32,923
and I've been in this wheelchair
ever since.

67
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:34,875
I like that you
can tell me a story

68
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:36,977
starting at the Clam
and ending on a Ferris wheel.

69
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:38,278
Yeah, people
are starving in Africa,

70
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:39,663
and I'm at a carnival

71
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:42,049
with my best buddies
on a beautiful night.

72
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,802
Blessings. Blessings.

73
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:51,508
So, Joe, it must
feel great to finally

74
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:53,243
have some closure
with Bobby Briggs.

75
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:54,545
Yeah.

76
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,814
You know last night was
the first time in 15 years

77
00:02:56,848 --> 00:02:58,365
I didn't strangle
Bonnie in my sleep?

78
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,033
Okay.

79
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:03,003
Hey, Dad, you're gonna
want to see this.

80
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:06,390
Again recapping
our breaking news,

81
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:09,843
longtime fugitive Bobby Briggs
has escaped from police custody.

82
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:11,979
His whereabouts
are currently unknown.

83
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:14,398
News of Briggs's escape
first broke on Telemundo,

84
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:15,866
if you can believe that.

85
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,218
<i>Escapo!</i>
<i>Escapo! Escapo!</i>

86
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:20,771
Briggs reportedly escaped
during a prison open house,

87
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:23,540
an event that will most likely
be canceled in the future.

88
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:26,176
No, no!
I can't believe it.

89
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:27,845
Oh, don't worry, Joe,
they'll get him back.

90
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,046
No, they won't!

91
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,448
It took 15 years
to catch him.

92
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:33,750
Well, this seems like a good
time to be heading out.

93
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:35,068
I should be getting back anyway.

94
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,637
I left Rupert with a sitter.

95
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:38,071
Well, you know
where everything is.

96
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:40,274
Feel free to help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

97
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:45,145
And Mr. Con Man here can have
pudding or ice cream, not both.

98
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:50,601
Chief, can I have a word?

99
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,569
Yeah, but first,
you have to agree

100
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:54,071
there's a huge
difference

101
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:56,240
between bisexual men
and homosexual men.

102
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:57,841
Sure, Chief.
Thank you. Huge.

103
00:03:57,876 --> 00:03:59,576
What is it?

104
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:01,111
Well, Chief, I'm here
because I want you

105
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:02,479
to put me on the Briggs case.

106
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:03,614
Absolutely not.

107
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:04,448
Come on, Chief!

108
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:05,716
I know everything about Briggs.

109
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,751
I'm the only one
who can catch him.

110
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:09,887
No, Swanson, you're
too close to the case.

111
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:11,722
I'm putting Officers
Grant and Casey on it

112
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:13,457
because they're so
far from the case,

113
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,958
they don't care
about it at all.

114
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,793
Hi, Chief.
Hi.

115
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:17,961
This isn't fair!

116
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,630
Swanson, you know
your assignment.

117
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:21,331
You get me the guy who's
been rubbing his butt

118
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,000
all over Dunkin' Donuts.

119
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:25,269
Can I help you?

120
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:26,703
Not illegal. Not illegal.

121
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:28,438
Show me the law.
Not illegal.

122
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:34,478
Hey, Joe, look,
I know you're down

123
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:36,847
about this Briggs thing,
and that kind of bums me out,

124
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,498
so I got you
this Cookie Puss.

125
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,850
(laughs)
Isn't that funny?

126
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:41,652
Look at that weird nose.

127
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:44,021
I think your nose
is weird.

128
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,756
Guys, I'm telling you, I...

129
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,025
I just don't think
I could live with Briggs

130
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:50,093
on the lam for another 15 years.

131
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:51,895
Well, why don't you
do something about it?

132
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,164
I can't do anything about it.
The chief won't let me.

133
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:55,499
Joe, if they don't
find this guy,

134
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,701
it's gonna eat you alive
for the rest of your life.

135
00:04:57,735 --> 00:04:59,336
You got to take matters
into your own hands.

136
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,671
You got to go after this guy.

137
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:02,539
But that's a breach
of police protocol.

138
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,241
This isn't about you
as a cop.

139
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:05,742
This is
about you as a man.

140
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,444
Come on, what do you say?

141
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:09,730
Quagmire and I will help you
bring this guy to justice.

142
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:10,998
(chuckles) Peter,
what did I say

143
00:05:11,032 --> 00:05:13,066
about you volunteering
me for (bleep)?

144
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:15,202
All right, let's do it!

145
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:16,887
MAYOR WEST:
Well, if you're gonna do it,

146
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:19,656
you're gonna need someone
who's very good at disguise.

147
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:21,224
Who said that?

148
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,226
I'd love to go with you,
but I can't.

149
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,861
I'm supposed to be
the gift table

150
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:26,830
at a Bar Mitzvah tomorrow.

151
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:34,689
All right, if we're
gonna go after Briggs,

152
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:36,624
this might be a good
place to start.

153
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:40,862
I've spent the
last 15 years

154
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:42,380
gathering
information on him,

155
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:44,015
and it's all here.

156
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,900
Every crime he's committed,
every associate he's...

157
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:48,469
Oh, look, Briggs
was All-County JV swimming.

158
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:50,304
Well, I don't just
focus on the negative.

159
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:53,674
Joe, your 25-year-old son
and your baby daughter share

160
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,210
a room just so you can keep
a weirdo <i>Beautiful Mind</i> room?

161
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:57,845
Isn't that a little bizarre?

162
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,582
And then we dug the bullets out
of that Iraqi family's skulls

163
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:03,417
so they couldn't
be traced back to us.

164
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:06,053
MAN'S VOICE:
<i>Today, I saw a balloon.</i>

165
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:08,489
Briggs' FBI profile
says the only relationship

166
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:12,293
he's maintained over the years
is with a stripper named Tanya.

167
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:13,795
Tax records show
she currently works

168
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,396
at a club in Atlantic City.

169
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,631
So that's our first stop.

170
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,232
Is there touching
at the club?

171
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,635
I-I-I don't know,
Peter. Maybe.

172
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,303
Okay, this is good,
this is good.

173
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:24,372
I'll be sure to pack
my blamming jeans.

174
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:28,976
Hey, listen,
thanks for agreeing

175
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:31,279
to take care of Principessa
while we're gone, Lois.

176
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:32,313
It's our pleasure.

177
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:33,781
She looks like
a nice kitty.

178
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:35,316
Uh, kitty?

179
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,984
Lois, she is
a purebred Persian.

180
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,054
I can trace her lineage
to the cats kept by Cleopatra.

181
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:41,923
Just tell me what
I need to do, Glenn.

182
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:43,758
Well, first, she has
a very active bowel.

183
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,660
You can't be too generous
with the baby wipes.

184
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:47,979
Stroke front to back
like you would on yourself.

185
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:50,298
Otherwise, you're smashing
feces into her genitals.

186
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:51,549
Also, she's very skittish,

187
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,518
so you have to
touch her like this.

188
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:56,254
I'm going to touch you now.

189
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:57,455
Is that okay?

190
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,273
See how I'm going?

191
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:04,212
Slowly, slowly.

192
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:07,181
Oh, the mysteries
you keep inside of you.

193
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:09,567
PETER: Quagmire, come on,
let's go.

194
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:12,503
All right, I guess we're off.

195
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:13,804
Hey, you guys,
check out the look

196
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,439
on Lois's face
when I do this.

197
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:17,375
(tires screech)

198
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:18,576
Peter!

199

Clean that up, you idiot!

Love you.

Boy, it'll be satisfying
to finally slap the cuffs

202
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:33,507
on Briggs once and for all.

203
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:35,509
Hey, you ever just drive
through a town and wonder,

204

All the time.

205
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,847
Look at this place.
I mean, what-what's going on?

206
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:41,899
There's an adult
with a lemonade stand.

207
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,568
That Chinese restaurant
still has the sign

208
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:44,852
from when it was a mechanic.

209

just changing mufflers.

There's an apartment
above that Arby's.

212
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:52,192
With toys in the window.

213
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:53,694
Someone has built
a life up there.

214
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:55,112
What a mess.

215
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:56,797
I'm telling you,
the Founding Fathers would be

216
00:07:56,832 --> 00:07:58,699
very disappointed in
where their country ended up.

217
00:07:58,717 --> 00:08:00,868
Eh, it wasn't so perfect
back then, either.

no longer will free men

00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:33,748
Damn it.
There's no way across.

319
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:35,884
Spidey, can you swing us
across with your web?

320
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,853
No, I can't
swing you across.

321
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,654
And it's Spider-Man,
not Spidey.

322
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:41,556
I'm pretty sure I've heard
people call you Spidey.

323
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,024
Yeah, close friends.

324
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,259
What's your name?
Peter.

325
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:45,961
Hey, Petey,
do stuff for me.

326
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:48,029
Oh, I don't like that.
Yeah, you don't like it.

327
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:50,131
And you're a fat nobody,
and I'm (bleep) Spider-Man,

328
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,000
so how do you
think I feel?

329
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,272
He's getting away.
Guys, drop me over the side!

330
00:12:57,306 --> 00:12:58,440
Are you crazy, Joe?!

331
00:12:58,474 --> 00:12:59,791
That fall
will kill you.

332
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:01,826
Not if I land on my legs.

333
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,580
(grunting)

334
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,415
PETER:
Heads up.

335
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:10,802
(panting)

336
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:13,638
I got you now, Briggs.

337
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:29,788
CROWD:
Move that bus!

338
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:32,190
(cheering)

339
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:33,675
(gasps)

340
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,344
Enjoy your new home.

341
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,281
He's gone, you guys!

342
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:40,448
I had him!

343
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:42,017
That was our one chance!

344
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:43,151
It's all right, Joe.

345
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:44,586
You got nothing
to be ashamed of.

346
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,620
You're a great cop

347
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:46,922
with a very
distinguished career.

348
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:48,456
You caught that guy
who was killing

349
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:49,624
all those
Filipino girls.

350
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,393
Yeah, but this was important!

351
00:13:51,427 --> 00:13:53,194
This was the guy
who ruined my life.

352
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:55,497
The one perp
who meant everything to me.

353
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:56,848
If I caught this guy,

354
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:58,583
I'd finally be able
to sleep at night.

355
00:13:58,618 --> 00:13:59,701
Damn it!

356
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:00,769
(siren whoops)

357
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:02,187
Oh, thank God. Cops.

358
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,221
Oh, good.

359
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:04,456
You guys
can still catch Briggs.

360
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,557
He's headed that way.

361
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:06,758
We're not here for him.

362
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:07,892
We're here for you guys.

363
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:09,361
You're under arrest
for interfering

364
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:10,929
with a police
investigation.

365
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,097
What?

366
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:13,398
Yeah, what the hell?

367
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:15,567
You should be out there
arresting the real criminals.

368
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:16,868
Like switchblade-wielding
white guys

369
00:14:16,902 --> 00:14:19,671
from movies and TV
who don't talk like people talk.

370
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,006
Easy, mama.

371
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,457
Hand over that purse,
and everything

372
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,509
will be real cool,
you dig?

373
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:31,471
Guys, you got to let us
out of here.

374
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:32,672
The real criminal's
getting away.

375
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,341
Yeah, the bastard's
making a break for it,

376
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,126
just like
South America.

377
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,444
Hmm.

378
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:39,879
Lot of black guys over there.

379
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:41,431
Hey, man,
where you going?

380
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:42,832
I'll be back.
I'm coming back.

381
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,117
I'll be right back.

382
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,685
Why would the cops
arrest us

383
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,821
instead of going
after Briggs?

384
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,958
Flannigan?
Wait a minute.

385
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:54,160
That's one of the corrupt cops
who helped harbor Briggs

386
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:56,162
while he was on the lam
for 15 years.

387
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:57,530
These guys are bad news.

388
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:58,698
Oh, my God.

389
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,350
What are they
going to do to us?

390
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:02,202
We're not going to stick around
to find out.

391
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,004
Joe, hold your handcuffs
over my lap.

392
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:05,138
(zip)

393
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,306
What the hell is that?

394
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,641
Swiss Army penis.

395
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,059
(sawing)

396
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:10,827
Wow, Quagmire.
That's incredible.

397
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:12,128
Peter?

398
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:13,229
(sawing)

399
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:14,898
Yours are made
of a stronger metal.

400
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:18,001
We're going to have to go
with the acetylene torch penis.

401
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:19,502
Don't...
don't look right at it.

402
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:22,489
My STDs help it
burn brighter.

403
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:25,675
The keys are in
the ignition. Let's go!

404
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:30,096
I told you to search
that guy's penis.

405
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:32,182
You say that
about everybody.

406
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,385
Yeah, we did it!
But we lost Briggs.

407
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:37,020
How are we
going to find him now?

408
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:38,271
We got nothing.

409
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:40,273
Well, I don't know if
it helps, but I found

410
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:42,075
this number next to the
phone in his kitchen.

411
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,160
I was saving it 'cause
I was going to make

412
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,745
a scrapbook of the
trip for you guys.

413
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,997
Let me see that.

414
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:49,232
This is the area code
for Juarez, Mexico.

415
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,900
He's trying to get
over the border!

416
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,869
You think so?
Definitely.

417
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:54,371
There's only one road
into Juarez,

418
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:55,955
and it goes
through El Paso.

419
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,624
We got to get
to El Paso.

420
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:58,958
Joe, how do you know

421
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,510
the area code for
Juarez, Mexico?

422
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,463
There was a stem cell doctor
I went down there to see.

423
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:06,499
He just rubbed, like,
salsa on my legs.

424
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:11,571
Hey, you're not
in uniform.

425
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,340
Are you guys cops?

426
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:15,041
Are you guys cops?

427
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:16,559
They know we're not cops!

428
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:17,593
(tires squealing)

429
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,584
All right, guys,
the next flight

430
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,052
to El Paso leaves
in 40 minutes.

431
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:27,354
But Briggs is ahead of us.

432
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:28,655
Won't he already be there?

433
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,690
No, he'd never risk
going through an airport.

434
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:32,108
Too many cops,
too many cameras,

435
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:33,143
too much security.

436
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:34,344
I don't know, Joe.

437
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:36,079
Sometimes the
security's pretty lax.

438
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:38,281
I mean, the last plane
I was on got gay-jacked.

439
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:40,984
This plane's going to Miami!

440
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,618
(passengers gasp)

441
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:44,637
(electronic dance music playing)

442
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,030
Hey, Lois?

443
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:55,498
Shh. Quiet, Brian.

444
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,267
Mom's taking a nap
on the couch.

445
00:16:57,301 --> 00:16:59,135
Yeah. And look,
she fell asleep

446
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:01,388
with the cat right
on her chest.

447
00:17:09,914 --> 00:17:11,798
Isn't that cute?

448
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,168
(purring)

449
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:25,795
Meow.

450
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,864
Purr. Purr.

451
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:29,866
I think you're dreaming.

452
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,018
No, I'm not.

453
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,459
BRIAN:
Stupid cat!

454
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,764
God, it's so damn hot.

455
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,065
Hey, I got an idea.

456
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,451
Let's make
scalding asphalt angels.

457
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:50,904
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

458
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:52,122
(sizzling)

459
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:55,091
Second-degree burns;
first-degree fun.

460
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:57,360
Geez, how long we got to
stand out here like this?

461
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:58,495
Till Briggs comes through.

462
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:00,196
You know, I was thinking
about that, Joe.

463
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:02,665
If Briggs is driving here,
that's like 2,000 miles.

464
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,801
It's going to be at
least a couple of days.

465
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,586
Huh. I guess you're right.

466
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,105
Well, what are we going to do
for two days in El Paso?

467
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:12,342
There's a Chicano
heritage festival.

468
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:13,610
No way.

469
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:15,278
KC and the Sunshine Band
is playing.

470
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:16,446
Why?

471
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,914
Or we could visit
the Pershing House

472
00:18:17,948 --> 00:18:19,616
where John Pershing
took control

473
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,951
of the Eighth Army
Brigade in 1914.

474
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:24,420
So, that's his bed?
Yes.

475
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:25,855
So, that's his desk?
Yes.

476
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,257
So, that's his lamp?
Yes.

477
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,658
So, that's his dresser?
Yes.

478
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,160
So, that's his window?
Yes.

479
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,494
So, that's his floor?
Yes.

480
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:33,196
Wow.

481
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:38,735
What do you got
there, Quagmire?

482
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:39,969
Is that Briggs?

483
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:41,237
No, this guy's clean.

484
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:42,972
Well, send him through.
What's the holdup?

485
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:44,407
Sombreros! Maracas!

486
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:46,342
Ceramic Winnie the Pooh dolls!

487
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:47,577
Get 'em now, folks!

488
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:49,846
You're not going to find
this stuff in Mexico!

489
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:53,166
Come on. What's
going on up there?

490
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,034
Briggs.

491
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,590
Damn it!
He's getting away!

492
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,447
(grunts)

493
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:30,169
You're not going to get away
this time, you son of a bitch.

494
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:31,504
Please, don't kill me.

495
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:32,705
I'm not married.

496
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,173
My life is awesome.

497
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:37,227
I've waited 15 years
for this moment, Briggs.

498
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,229
Do you have any idea
what it's like

499
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:42,131
to have to lift yourself
into a wheelchair every morning?

500
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:44,817
To have your wife look at you
like you're half a man?

501
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,469
To get preferential parking?

502
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:48,655
To board a plane early
with the first-class people

503
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,156
and gold card members?

504
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,908
All right, it's not all bad.

505
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,743
But I'm not going to kill you.

506
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,279
I'm not an animal like you.

507
00:19:56,313 --> 00:19:58,047
So, what are you going to do,
arrest me?

508
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:59,215
No.

509
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,150
I don't arrest cripples.

510
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:03,786
(groaning)

511
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,505
By the way, you're under arrest.

512
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,041
I only said that last thing
'cause it seemed cool.

513
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:09,776
Oh, my God,
that was so awesome.

514
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,077
I saw everything.

515
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:12,478
You were all like...
(deep mumbling)

516
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,213
And Briggs was all like...
(high-pitched mumbling)

517
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:16,115
And then you were all like...
(mimics two gunshots)

518
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,750
And then Briggs's legs
were like...

519
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,385
(mimics video game
sound effects)

520
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,803
Oh, crap, he's dead.

521
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,138
I think he bled out.

522
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:23,973
I must have hit
the femoral artery.

523
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:26,192
Ah, just kick him into Mexico.

524
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,949
Guys, I can't thank you
enough for what you did.

525
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,651
You risked your
lives for me,

526
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:36,319
and I couldn't have
done it without you.

527
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:37,971
Hey, that's what
pals are for.

528
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,238
Yeah, and thanks for letting me

529
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:41,024
fire a few rounds
into Briggs's corpse.

530
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:44,027
That was the most powerful
I've felt in a couple years.

531
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:45,161
Well, you guys helped me

532
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:46,947
finally have some closure
in my life.

533
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:49,517
I feel like a new man--
like I'm reborn.

534
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,259
Joe, you have blood just
pouring out of your pant leg.

535
00:20:53,478 --> 00:20:55,846
Yeah, I had a ball
blow in the river.

536
00:20:55,881 --> 00:21:00,881
