00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:37,968
我曾经一度
I think at one point

23
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:39,949
以为我们可以做到200集的
I thought we would get to 200 episodes,

24
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,614
然后当我们被砍了后
and then when we got canceled,

25
00:00:41,648 --> 00:00:44,082
我想"不 我们到不了200集了"
I thought, "No, we won't get to 200 episodes."

26
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,018
然后 当我们重新回归
And then, when we came back,

27
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:48,253
我想 "耶 也许我们能到200集"
I thought, "Yeah, maybe we'll get to 200 episodes."

28
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:50,656
现在 感觉就像 "我日 到200集了"
And now, it's like, "Oh, crap, 200 episodes."

29
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,124
我为你自豪
I'm so proud of you.

等等 我们已经播出200集了
Wait. We've been on for 200 episodes?

36
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:03,552
哇 我真是快要…
Wow. I'm actually almost...

37
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:06,772
我所做的就是希望自己的体重
What I've done is I wanted my weight

38
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:08,757
和我们的集数相等
to equal how many episodes we have.

39
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:11,510
那我应该快到200磅(90.7公斤)了
So I'm almost just about at 200 pounds.

40
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:14,864
而我打算继续随集数来增加体重
And I plan to continue to rise with the episodes.

41

所以如果这节目播到500集 我就
So if the show goes 500 episodes, I will

I've always found it really funny and I was excited when

45
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:29,755
其他那么多人也如此认为 这就说明
so many other people did 'cause it meant that

我们都有相同的地方

这部剧的灵魂本质上
Inherently, like, in the show's DNA,

60
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:06,448
就是有天马行空的发展方向
has the ability to go a lot of different directions.

61
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:10,352
我们可以讲由强烈个性驱使的传统家庭故事
We could tell conventional family stories that are very character driven.

62
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:11,837
已经4点整 你们可以走了

嘿 闭上你的狗嘴
Hey! Shut up.

68
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:23,007
当然 也可以讲兄弟间的喜剧
And also, you could tell buddy comedy.

69
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:24,683
你可以做兄弟间的喜剧
You could do buddy comedy episodes

70
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:26,635
比如Peter Quagmire 和Joe的
with Peter and Quagmire and Joe.

71

你愿意被一个男人按摩
Would you rather get a massage from a man

72
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:32,424
还是被一个女医生开刀
or a surgery from a female doctor?

73
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,344
哇
Wow!

74
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:38,648
除此之外 Stewie还有其科学特长 
An then beyond that, Stewie's got this sort of scientific bent, where

75
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:42,167
让我们可以讲各种科幻故事
it opens the door to tell all kinds of sci-fi stories.

76
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:44,837
达芬奇肯定就是我祖先

Bertram就是来杀他的
That's who Bertram's here to kill.

79
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:49,808
那就是说你是意大利人
So, that means you're Italian.

80
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:52,745
当然 我的至爱就是意大利面和坐在马桶上抽烟
Of course, my love for SpaghettiOs and smoking on the toilet.

81
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:53,649
这样就都说得通了
It all makes sense.

82
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:58,308
知道么 有这么多讲述故事的方式真的很有帮助
You know, it really helps having all those avenues to pursue.

83
00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:59,469
我总说
Creatively, I've always said

84
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:01,980
这是除了我给"Monty Python"做编剧来最剧创造性的活了
this is the closest I've ever come to writing <i>Monty Python,</i>

85
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:04,306
只要你有任何搞笑点子
where any funny idea that you have

86
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:07,610
你就能把它放到一集"恶搞之家"中表现出来
you can somehow fit it into an episode of <i>Family Guy.</i>

87
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:10,663
甚至完全不需符合主线内容 只要够搞笑就行
It doesn't even have to serve the story as long as it's funny enough.

00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:18,003
在它背后戳了几个洞 这样它就能呼吸了
Poked some holes in its back so it can breathe.

92

来 看看这… 我的天
See, look at this... Oh, boy.

好吧 等会 等一下
All right, hang on, hang on.

94
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:48,600
我同样认为这部秀在其他方面也很特殊
I also feel like this show is unique in that...

95
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:53,205
因为它是动画 所以我们可以把下限设的更低些
Because it's animated we can push boundaries a little bit further.

96
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,208
我们角色说的某些话
Some of the things that our characters say,

97
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:57,710
比如是出自常驻演员
if they were coming out of a live actor or actress,

98
00:03:57,744 --> 00:03:59,561
就会有点让人不爽
would seem sort of off-putting.

99
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:02,798
你是在告诉我你对我的残疾有意见吗
Are you telling me that you have a problem with me being handicapped?

S05E14

101
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:05,501
确实如此 Joe 我认为这是不道德的
As a matter of fact, Joe, yes, I think it's immoral.

102
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,137
这是你们逼迫美国人民选择的一种生活方式
It's a lifestyle choice you're forcing on America.

103
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,773
我们残疾人是一群很自豪的人
We handicapped are a proud people.

是啊 当你不在我们帮你预定的餐桌上

which we gave you.

这档秀有种特质就是
There are things about the show that are

107
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:20,665
也许有点无厘头
maybe gratuitous.

但是却不是故意为之
But the show doesn't set out to shock for shock's sake.

111
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,607
而且必须要搞笑才行

那如果她是被强奸的呢
Well, what if a woman is raped?

129
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,558
也许她就应该在问我意见前先考虑到那个
Maybe she should have thought of that before she asked me for directions.

- 什么 - 那乱伦呢 Peter
- Huh? - What about incest, Peter?

So what, you're saying Touch Eyes doesn't deserve to exist?

Well, you don't mind him when you want a needle threaded.

00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,061
Peter 如果生下孩子
Peter, what if carrying the baby to term

140
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:24,396
会威胁到那母亲的生命呢
would endanger the mother's life?

141
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,365
你刚才说的我有7个字不懂
I don't know what seven of those words were.

142
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,066
那如果B超上
What if you look at the ultrasound

143
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:31,303
显示那婴儿缺胳膊少腿呢
and see that the baby is going to be born with no arms and no legs?

144
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:32,538
那你就叫他Mat
You name it Mat.

145
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:33,639
(HONKS)

146
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:36,675
就算在我们疯玩的场所"恶搞之家"中
Even in our crazy venue, which is  <i>Family Guy,</i>

147
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:40,345
我们觉得带来的是一个相对平衡
we felt we'd brought, you know, a relatively balanced

148
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:42,314
也比较能理智讨论的
and sort of intelligent discussion

149
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:44,399
一个非常非常困难的话题
of a very, very difficult subject.

150
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:46,969
那集一点也没有什么争议
That episode was not controversial at all.

151
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:49,204
就像"当你想温斯坦许愿"
<i>It's just like "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein,"</i>

152
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:49,204
S03E22

153
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,757
他们觉得特有争议的那集一样
was an episode they felt that it was too controversial.

154
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,041
但完全没有
And it's not at all.

155
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:55,861
其实那是很精彩的一集
It's, you know... It's one of the nicer episodes actually.

156
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:59,081
Max Max Max 咱就别否认自己的血统了
Max, Max, Max, let's not deny our heritages.

157
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:01,116
你是犹太人 你很会弄钱
You're Jewish, you're good with money.

158
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:03,535
我是爱尔兰人 我喝酒 禁止同性恋
I'm Irish, I drink and I ban homosexuals

159
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,220
参加我的游行
from marching in my parade.

160
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:12,510
这是一个关于爱与失去
This is a story of love and loss,

161
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:12,510
S06E01

162
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:13,845
父与子
fathers and sons,

163
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,315
和为了保留国际产品的权利的故事
and the foresight to retain international merchandizing rights.

164
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:20,651
这就是"星球大战"的故事
This is the story of  <i>Star Wars.</i>

165
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:25,923
我们剧集里做了不少"星战"的笑话 然后 呃
We had done a number of <i>Star Wars</i> gags on the show and, uh...

166
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,544
因为做得太平凡所以福克斯法律部告诉我们
They were so frequent that Fox Legal said to us,

167
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:31,462
"如果你们继续这么干
"If you're gonna keep doing these

168
00:06:31,513 --> 00:06:34,182
我们就要从卢卡斯影业那里取得许可了
"we have to get clearance from Lucasfilm

169
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:37,535
因为我们不可能不被起诉的
"because there's just no way we're not going to get sued."

170
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,655
这会让你保持温暖知道我把庇护所建好
This will keep you warm until I get the shelter built.

171
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:40,655


172
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:45,126
你确定没问题吗
You're sure this is okay?

173
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,944
嗯 你只是切入我的脂肪而已
Yeah, you're just cutting into the fat.

174
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:48,946
然后我们说 "啊天 好吧 那是最后一次了"
And we said, "Ah, well, God, that's the end of it."

175
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:51,032
知道么 "我们不能再继续恶搞星战了"
You know, "We're not going to be able to do these anymore."

176
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,568
然后卢卡斯影业的话让我们大吃一惊
And Lucasfilm surprised us by saying,

177
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:55,336
"不要停 我们很喜欢"
"Yeah, no, we like this."

178
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,638
这让我们萌发了一个主意
What started as a small idea became

179
00:06:57,673 --> 00:07:02,109
做了一集由Alex Sulkin编剧的一小时星战恶搞秀
a one hour parody of <i>Star Wars</i> that Alex Sulkin wrote.

180
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:03,444
哔 啵 哔
Beep boop beep.

181
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:03,444
S06E01

182
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:06,130
他说有一些生物正从东南方过来
He says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.

183
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,481
我不是这么说的
That's not what I said.

184
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:10,318
我说的是这星球上一包薄荷糖都没有
I said there ain't a pack of menthols on this planet.

185
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:13,655
自从我小时候起我就是星战的超级粉丝
I'm a huge <i>Star Wars</i> fan from way back as a kid,

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,655
我们很多人都是如此
as many of us are.

187
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:17,225
好 一会门会开然后你们说"不许动"
Okay, so the door's going to open and you guys say, "Freeze,"

188
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:17,225
S08E21

189
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,492
然后用你们的枪指着他们
and point your guns at 'em.

190
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,361
或者 呃 应该是我用枪指着他们
Or, you know... Or should it just be me?

191
00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:22,046
呃 知道么 我想这样更好
Yeah, you know what, I think that'd be better.

192
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:24,198
出去 快快快 就我一个人
Get out, go, go, go. Just me.

193
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:26,851
噢 我还没准备好… 嗨
Oh, I wasn't ready... Hi!

194
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:30,571
我写这剧本非常有趣
Those were very fun for me to work on.

195
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:33,491
知晓这些电影的所有台词
Knowing every line of those movies inside and out,

196
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:36,310
所以再把它表现出来并弄得搞笑是很有意思的
it was fun to kind of go through it and make fun of it.

197
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:40,414
你懂的 说那些你一直想说的笑话
You know, tell the jokes that you'd always think of saying.

198
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:43,050
我在那 贾巴的行宫
Where am I? <i>Jabba's Palace.</i>

199
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:43,050
S09E18

200
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:44,619
你谁啊
Who are you?

201
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,404
爱你的人
Someone who loves you.

202
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:48,940
哇 你快闷死我了 给我点空间
Whoa, you are smothering me and I need my space.

203
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:52,643
这部剧中我最喜欢的段子
Some of my favorite gags from the series

204
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,178
就是出自这几集
come out of some of those episodes.

205
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,515
我喜欢第一部"星战特辑"中
I love in the first <i>Star Wars</i> episode

206
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,433
他们在垃圾压缩机内
when they're in the trash compactor

207
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,269
然后Peter找到张破旧的沙发
and Peter finds an old ratty couch.

208
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:04,021
喔 喔 喔 停 停 停 停下
PETER: Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop.

209
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:04,021
S06E01

210
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:05,106
怎么着 怎么样 怎么了啊
What? What? What?

211
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:06,641
- 怎样啊 - 不 不 不 转过来
- What? - No, no, no, twist it.

212
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:07,992
- 正在呢 - 不 不 不 不对
- I am. - No, no, no, no.

213
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:09,727
不不不 另一边 你转错方向了
No, no, no, other way. You're twisting it the wrong way.

214
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,329
哪边 你到底想让我怎么做
Which way? What do you want me to do?

215
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:13,598
往下看 好吗 看着我 看我怎么做 
Just look down, all right? Just look at me, look what I'm doing.

216
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:14,932
- 嗯 - 好 看到我是往哪边转了么
- Yeah. - All right, see the way I'm twisting it?

217
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,601
- 嗯 - 好 你那边也这么转
- Yeah. - All right, turn it that way from your end.

218
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:17,802
- 好 - 好 只管…
- Okay. - Okay, just...

219
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:19,854
- 不不不 不对 - 怎么了
- No, no, no, no... - What?

220
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:21,238
好吧 嘿 先放下来再说
All right, hey, just put it down.

221
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,823
- 放下来 就放下来 - 好吧
-Put it down, just drop it. - All right.

222
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,826
我们可以用所有约翰·威廉斯作曲的超赞音乐
We were able to use all that great John Williams music.

223
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:25,826
为"星球大战"作曲

224
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:30,998
我是说 他们给了我们把这个做好的工具
I mean, they really gave us the tools to do this right, and...

225
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:34,535
因为他们信任我们
And it was because they trusted us.

226
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:37,622
他们知道我们是粉丝 不会
They knew that we were fans and that we weren't gonna...

227
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:42,093
我们不会毁掉他们的财产
We weren't gonna destroy their property.

228
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:48,749
- 我说 Brian 快看 往下数第三排 - 什么
- I say, Brian, look, three rows down. - What?

229
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:48,749
S03E20

230
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:50,451
那是Tom Bosley吗?
Is that Tom Bosley?

231
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:53,471
为什么Tom Bosley会在去往瑞士的火车上
What would Tom Bosley be doing on a train in Switzerland?

232
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:53,471
美国演员 因出演美剧"Happy Days"知名

233
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:55,022
我基本可以确定是他
I'm almost certain.

234
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:56,273
Tom!

235
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,209
- 他朝这儿看了吗 - 我不知道
- Did he look? - I don't know.

236
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,311
如果我叫了 你就得看 
Well, if I yell, you have to watch.

237
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:01,779
Tom Bosley!

238
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:03,481
- 不 不是他 - 哦
- No, it's not him. - Huh.

239
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:04,732
"之路"系列一直很有意思
The Road shows have been a lot of fun.

240
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:08,602
我们是从第二季的"罗德岛之旅"开始的
We started with "Road to Rhode Island" in season one.

241
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:08,602
S02E13

242
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:12,390
正好Seth有个想法来做一集
And, uh, Seth had this idea to do an episode

243
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:15,676
基于Bob Hope和Bing Crosby的"之旅"节目
<i>based on those Bob Hope, Bing Crosby Road shows.</i>

244
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:15,676
美国超级笑星

245
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:18,879
也许你已经了解 Seth爱Bob Hope
Seth, as you probably know, loves Bob Hope.

246
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:21,999
然后他非常熟悉那些电影
And, you know, is very familiar with those movies

247
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,135
还有电影中的营员
and the music from those movies and...

248
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:26,637
所以 我觉得制作"XX之旅"
So, I think that having "Road to..."

249
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:28,122
以Brian和Stewie为主角
with Brian and Stewie,

250
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,892
他们其实就是我们的Bing Crosby和Bob Hope
they're sort of our Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.

251
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:35,596
在那之前Stewie基本上一直活在自己的世界中
Up until that point Stewie had kind of existed in his own world.

252
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,867
他会与Rupert说话和孵化自己的邪恶计划
He would talk to Rupert and hatch diabolical schemes.

253
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:43,254
而Brian那是则是Peter的跟班
And Brian meanwhile was kind of Peter's sidekick.

254
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,738
他们完全是两个世界的
And they were kind of separate.

255
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:47,043
这是我们首次把他们配对在一起
And this was the first time we kind of paired those two,

256
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:49,068
结果非常成功
and it just clicked.

257
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:51,495
如果一切运转正常
Okay, if everything worked properly

258
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:51,495
S07E03

259
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,699
这应该就是Mort来时的地点与时间
this should be the exact time and place that Mort was sent to.

260
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,367
现在我们只需搞清楚我们在哪儿
Now, we've just got to figure out where we are.

261
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:57,735
或者身处何时
Or when we are.

262
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,671
噢 时间旅行者说这话真是2B啊
Oh, that's such a douche time traveler thing to say.

263
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:02,473
从那之后 我们就开始
From that point forward we started

264
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:04,558
把Stewie和Brian写在一起
pairing Stewie and Brian together on stories,

265
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:06,160
因为他们在一起太出彩了
'cause they were so good together.

266
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:09,396
这也是一个很好的例子 关于如何
And it's a perfect example of how you can

267
00:10:09,414 --> 00:10:11,398
创作出一部节目并
create a show and then

268
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,568
写出自己的风格 陆续有人进来
your writing style... Other people coming in,

269
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:16,337
这里就是指编剧团队
in this case, the writing staff,

270
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:19,740
可以发觉出你角色当中先前并没有发现的东西
can find things in your characters that you didn't see initially.

271
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:23,344
Brian和Stewie的关系现在显得理所当然
The Brian-Stewie relationship which now seems so obvious

272
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:25,535
但这并不是我
was not something that I thought of when

273
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
创作这档节目时的想法
I was creating the show.

274
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:31,368
他们总是互相捉弄
They're always sort of busting each other's chops

275
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,073
总是对对方怀有敌意
and, uh, antagonistic towards each other,

276
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:35,456
但他们也
but they're also...

277
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:38,075
我想他们发展成了死党
I think they've evolved into their best friends.

278
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:40,761
我能不能先说…我们能不能 比如 弄两个
(STAMMERING) Can I just say before... Can we just like take two...

279
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:40,761
S08E17

280
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:43,364
我钦佩…你真是太勇敢了
I love... You're so brave.

281
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:45,416
我真是钦佩你现在的勇气
I just love how brave you're being right now.

282
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,301
从没有感觉如此贴近你
This is like the closest I've ever felt to you.

283
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:49,870
哎 说真的 我也是这么想的
Okay. Oh, my God, I was thinking the same thing.

284
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:52,273
我们现在是如此同心同德
We are so us right now.

285
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:53,340
你知道吗
Do you know that?

286
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:55,342
那集Brian-Stewie
<i>MacFARLANE: And the Brian-Stewie episode,</i>

287
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:58,913
我们主要是想发掘是否
more than anything, we did to explore whether or not

288
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:02,867
两个动画人物
two animated characters

289
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:07,922
可以在一个房间维持半个小时的节目
with just a single room can sustain a half hour

290
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,040
纯粹是关于角色本身
purely on the strength of their characters.

291
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,711
我们想尝试这样的一集一定很有意思
We thought that it might be interesting to try an episode

292
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:16,247
就像看一部舞台剧
where it was almost like watching a play.

293
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:20,551
只有一个地点 两个人物在台上
Where it was one location, two people on stage,

294
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:24,939
没有嵌入笑话 只有22分钟的对话
no cutaways, nothing, just dialogue for 22 minutes.

295
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,173
这集非常的极端
It was very polarizing.

296
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:28,442
人们要么非常喜欢要么非常讨厌
People either loved it or they hated it.

297
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:30,010
他们认为这是革命性的
They thought it was revolutionary,

298
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:31,862
或者他们觉得这只是
or they thought it was just...

299
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:35,132
你知道 他们还是对Stewie尿布的事情有意见
You know, they couldn't get past the Stewie diaper thing.

300
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,035
看
Look!

301
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:38,035
S09E01

302
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,941
他死了
He's dead.

303
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:45,276
天啊
Oh, my God.

304
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,560
爽
Nice.

305
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:49,430
"无人生还"是我们以第一次用16x9画面的一集
"And Then There Were Fewer" was our first 16x9 episode,

306
00:11:49,464 --> 00:11:52,633
我们从这样变成了这样
when we went from this to this.

307
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:58,355
然后 我们觉得做了视觉特效超赞的一集
<i>And, um, we thought we'd do this big splashy visual episode.</i>

308
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,908
我喜欢那集因为那是首次
<i>I love that episode because it's the first time</i>

309
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:03,577
我们真的讲完了一个复杂的故事
we've really told a story that complex.

310
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:07,548
所以James Woods谋杀了Stephanie然后又自杀了
So James Woods murdered Stephanie and then he murdered himself.

311
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:08,849
就像电影"十字交锋"
Criss-cross.

312
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,936
动画师们做的太棒了
The animators did an amazing job.

313
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:13,604
美术师还有导演
The artists and the directors

314
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:15,272
以及所有做这些的人们
and everybody that worked on that.

315
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:18,409
观赏效果非常出色
It looks so great to watch

316
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:20,661
配乐也很棒
and the score is amazing.

317
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:23,330
配乐从头到尾都是非常华美
It's just a lush score all the way throughout.

318
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,466
我们在各处都会用到50
We use anywhere from a 50 to,

319
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,702
有时候是90件乐器的交响乐团在每一集节目中
in some cases, a 90-piece orchestra for every episode of the show.

320
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:31,722
几十人们不知道他们听到的是现场配乐
<i>Even if people don't know that what they're hearing is live music,</i>

321
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:32,857
现场交响乐团
<i>is a live orchestra,</i>

322
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:36,327
在潜意识层面使节目的档次提升了
<i>on a subconscious level it classes up the show.</i>

323
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,534
我知道那一定是Seth至今最喜欢的集数之一
I know that it happens to be one of Seth's favorite episodes to this day.

324
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:48,038
我想他真的很喜欢用电影的方法来表达
And I think he really liked approaching it like a movie.

325
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,974

347
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,934
我们在恶搞之家中制作了很多歌曲
We do a lot of musical numbers in <i>Family Guy.</i>

348
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,169
我们也觉得很有意思 Seth非常喜欢音乐
Which is fun for us. Seth is a big music fan.

349
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:55,039
他表演的技艺十分精湛

<i>♪ She's his Shipoopi♪</i>

359
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:12,256
这首Shipoopi是我们精心了编排舞蹈
MacFARLANE: Shipoopi <i>was so elaborately choreographed</i>

360
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,791
然后是视觉效果
<i>and then the visuals,</i>

361
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:18,629
这集的导演Dan Povenmire花了大量的时间在这上面
which Dan Povenmire, the director, spent a ton of time working on,

362
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:22,483
真的让编排中每一个点都达到了最佳效果
really hit every point in the orchestration.

363
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:26,470
这部剧让我最爱的就是
And the thing that I've always loved about the show is...

364
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:29,640
当我和我孩子和朋友谈论时
When I talk to my son and his friends, you know,

365
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:32,593
他们不知道Shipoopi是什么
they don't know what  <i>Shipoopi</i>  is.

366
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:36,380
他们也许不认识吉恩·凯利是谁
They might not know, you know, who Gene Kelly was,

367
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,266
但他们喜欢这段音乐剧
but they're loving the musical, you know, segments.

368
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:42,920
这就像 Seth是如何让

1千万少年喜欢上音乐剧的

<i>♪ And they'll tell you real sweet, with a musical tweet ♪</i>

374

今天是个吃派的好日子
<i>♪ It's a wonderful day for pie ♪</i>

375
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:04,742
我们第八季首集名为"多元宇宙之旅"
Our season seven premiere was an episode called "Road to the Multiverse."

376
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,344
而这首动人的歌曲名为
And there's this great musical number called

377
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:08,095
吃派的好日子
<i>It's A Wonderful Day for Pie,</i>

378
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,132
就跟你听到的一样没有什么实际内容
which is, you know, as devoid of content as it sounds.

379
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:14,301
就是Peter和Lois唱着他们多么爱吃派
It's just about Peter and Lois singing about how much they love pie.

380
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:17,721
但那一段动画做的非常出色
But the animation in that sequence is amazing.

381
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:21,542
视觉上 看到我们的角色全变成迪斯尼风
Visually, it was just fantastic to see our characters

382
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:23,344
是非常神奇的
animated in a Disney style.

383
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:25,029
我当时就像我们干的太棒了
I just thought that was so well done.

384
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:26,614
而且也很有意思
And it was a lot of fun.

385
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:28,282
呃 而且我们其实是即兴创作
Uh, and we sort of improvised

386
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,202
了部分歌词 就在房间里
some of the lyrics in the room.

387
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:32,336
Seth脱口而出
Seth just came out with...

388
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:35,706
今天是个吃派的好日子
 <i>♪ It's a wonderful day for pie ♪</i>

389
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:37,291
然后我们中的一个也跟着唱
And one of us goes...

390
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:40,678
而且闻着比我香多了
<i>♪ And it smells so much better than I ♪</i>

391
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:43,914
一只是Cleveland的臭鼬 然后就成了现在的样子
It was Cleveland as a skunk and it just came together.

392
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:47,334
那是非常棒的一段歌曲 我的最爱之一
And, uh, that was a great piece. One of my favorites.

393
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:49,103

<i>♪ All-consumin', poorly groomin' ♪</i>

399
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,399
唐氏综合症女孩一个好印象
<i>♪ Down's Syndrome girl ♪</i>

400
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:06,821
这首"唐氏综合症女孩"我觉得非常有趣 因为
The <i>Down's Syndrome Girl</i> song was fun for me because

401
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:10,558
那是我首次自己作词作曲
it was the first time I had written lyrics and a tune.

402
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:13,260
我基本上是走进去然后给Wlater Murphy唱了出来
<i>Which I basically went in and sang for Walter Murphy</i>

403
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:16,764
然后他重新编排 让它变得十分好听
<i>who then arranged it and actually made it sound good.</i>

404
00:16:16,882 --> 00:16:18,165
非常有意思的是
It's a lot of fun for us to...

405
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:22,253
我们来作词 然后有个出色的作曲家
You know, to write a song lyric and have a great composer

406
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:25,122
想Walter Murphy或者Ron Jones来让它变成音乐
like Walter Murphy or Ron Jones set it to music.

407
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,858
每口钟都会带着银色的热情被敲响
<i>♪ Each bell would peal with a silvery zeal ♪</i>

408
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:27,858
S09E07

409
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:30,961
这是当我们充满了节日的感觉时
<i>♪ As the holiday feeling was filling us ♪</i>

410
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:33,931
但现在我们只感觉到害怕
<i>♪ But now instead, all we're feeling is dread ♪</i>

411
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:36,500
因为圣诞节正在杀死我们
<i>♪ Because Christmastime is killing us ♪</i>

412
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:38,052
当我们制作圣诞特辑时
When we did our Christmas episode,

413
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:41,105
我最初是设想类似于"驯鹿鲁道夫"的动画电影
I had originally envisioned something like  <i>Rudolph</i>

414
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:44,191
差不多有4到6首歌
that had, like, four or five, six musical numbers in it.

415
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:46,143
我们最后决定制作2到3首
We ended up, like, doing two or three.

416
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:50,030
然后我写了这份歌词关于
And I had written this lyric about how...

417
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:53,317
我认为圣诞节变得是多么疯狂的总结
I was making a comment on how crazy Christmas has become

418
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:55,102
让我们完全失去了自我
and what it takes out of us all.

419
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:58,088
等烟硝散尽 这首歌非常成功
<i>And when the smoke cleared, it was a success.</i>

420
00:16:58,122 --> 00:17:00,257
我们还被艾美奖提名了
<i>And we were nominated for an Emmy.</i>

421
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,860
而且 令人意想不到的是
But also, a great unexpected thrill was

422
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,428
我们还被提名了格莱美奖
we were nominated for a Grammy.

423
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:06,463
你得了艾滋病 没错 你得了艾滋病
<i>♪ You have AIDS  Yes, you have AIDS ♪</i>

424
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:06,463
S04E05

425
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:09,850
没错 你得了艾滋病而非携带HIV 严重的艾滋病
<i>♪ Not HIV but full blown AIDS ♪</i>

426
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:13,387
我想理发店四重唱表演的第一首歌
MacFARLANE: <i>I think the first song that the barbershop quartet did</i>

427
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:15,356
是那首"艾滋歌"
<i>was the</i>  AIDS  <i>song.</i>

428
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:19,210
这也是另一个极好的例子
And that's a perfect example of another reason

429
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:24,081
为什么我们使用乐团然后让音乐变得更和谐
for using that orchestra and trying to be so musically legit.

430
00:17:24,115 --> 00:17:26,550
因为它能让你摆脱其中的内容
Because it allows you to get away with content

431
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,502
但你用其他方法是行不通的
that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get away with.

432
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:33,190
是啊 谈到把一个题材做的更让人舒服
Yeah, talk about making a subject matter a little more palatable.

433
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:36,096
人们喜欢这样的滑稽 这些家伙和谐的唱着
People love the absurdity of these guys singing such

434
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,494
离谱的歌词
an outrageous lyric,

435
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:40,214
但Seth喜欢它的是
but what Seth appreciates about it is

436
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:43,825
这些人展现出的不可置信的音乐天才
how unbelievably talented these guys are and were

437
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,640
在这些歌曲当中
in these pieces, musically.

438
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:48,439
提供了一个音乐缓冲
It provides a musical cushion

439
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:53,727
让你不会太过头
that prevents you from being completely crass,

440
00:17:53,778 --> 00:17:55,629
如果你一开始比较过头的话
if you're being that crass in the first place.

441
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:59,216
不过你从此就可告别安全套
<i>♪ You'll never have to wear a condom ♪ </i>

442
00:17:59,216 --> 00:17:59,216
S04E22

443
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:03,420
跟老婆嘿咻也不需要 
<i>♪ When you do it with your wife ♪ </i>

444
00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:05,656
或者是你乱搞的其他女人
<i>♪ Or anyone else you do it with ♪ </i>

445
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,675
我们保证不会乱说
<i>♪ We promise not to tell ♪ </i>

446
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:10,160
我也喜欢我们做的一些其他事情
I also like the little things that we do here and there,

447
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:12,863
比如 Stewie唱的民谣
like, Stewie singing little folk songs,

448
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:16,267
Stewie自己编的小曲
Stewie making up his own, you know, little songs,

449
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,636
讲的是什么 "弹着G和弦
talking about, you know, "Playing the G-chord

450
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,871
然后 我们弹D和弦
"and here we go to the D-chord."

451
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:25,409
然后Brain来了 我换了曲调
<i>♪ Then Brian comes in and I change up the tempo ♪ </i>

452
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:25,409
S07E07

453
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:29,179
Brain来了 我换了首歌
<i>♪ Brian comes in and it changes the song ♪ </i>

454
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:32,783
他看着我说我像个白痴
<i>♪ Looking at me like he thinks I'm a douche bag ♪ </i>

455
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:36,020
他很快将知道他大错特错
<i>♪ But he's gonna learn pretty fast that he's wrong ♪ </i>

456
00:18:36,054 --> 00:18:39,924
嘿 Brain 你干嘛要伤我的心
<i>♪ Hey, Brian, why are you bringing me down, man? ♪ </i>

457
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:42,443
干嘛要伤我的心 
<i>♪ Why are you bringing me down? ♪ </i>

458
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:44,228
别伤我的心
<i>♪ Don't bring me down! ♪ </i>

459
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:46,280
词曲均由Stewie Griffin创作
Music and lyrics by Stewie Griffin.

00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,280
S02E01 S01E04 S08E01 S10E03 S04E25

461
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:54,985
这部剧集产生了文化影响
MacFARLANE: <i>It's amazing to me that the show has had</i>

462
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:57,337
着实让我吃惊
<i>the cultural impact that it has.</i>

463
00:18:57,372 --> 00:19:00,874
在很长一段时间 "辛普森一家"是唯一一部
For a long while, <i>The Simpsons</i> was really the only show

464
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:03,443
能这样脱颖而出的
<i>that had broken out in this way</i>

465
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:07,102
我也希望我们能做一个祷告
<i>and I always hoped we would have a prayer of</i>

466
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,066
可以让我们的节目做得同样好
<i>maybe doing that as well.</i>

467
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:10,200
现在我认为我们做到了
And I think we've done that.

468
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:13,070
啊
Ah!

469
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:16,256
SMITH:  <i>One of the great things now is that we're syndicated.</i>

470
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:18,892
<i>So, we're on all the time.</i>

471
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:20,861
<i>And old people like us now.</i>

472
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:23,380
I have an Auntie Philly who's 92.

473
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:24,581
She loves  <i>Family Guy</i>

474
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:27,884
and she won't let any of her friends in the room when it's on

475
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,087
because old people talk back to the television.

476
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:31,338
She wants to hear it.

477
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:32,506
OLD WOMAN: What? OLD MAN: Huh?

478
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:33,740
What? Huh?

479
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,409
What? I forget.

480
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:38,495
I said it before, but we're so thankful to our fans

481
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,097
for bringing the show back from the dead,

482
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:42,249
<i>that I almost feel like we owe it to them</i>

483
00:19:42,283 --> 00:19:45,702
<i>to give 110% every day to every episode.</i>

484
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:48,388
I try to interact with the fans as much as I can.

485
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:49,890
I don't know if you can see right now,

486
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,525
but I'm actually eight months pregnant.

487
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,126
And this is a fan's baby.

488
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,795
You get crazy when you're pregnant.

489
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:56,580
(LAUGHING)

490
00:19:57,215 --> 00:19:58,231
(SOBBING)

491
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,380
I feel like if you love me from afar then the least I

492
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:04,410
can do is love you back.

493
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:07,724
And if that means carrying your child, so be it.

494
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:09,960
I love my fans.

495
00:20:09,994 --> 00:20:11,288
Keep digging, you know?

496
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:13,393
It feels like there's no more stories to tell

497
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:15,886
and then we dig for a while and something pops up that,

498
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:17,601
"Oh, we haven't done that."

499
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:18,802
(ROARING)

500
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:21,654
What's next is, I guess, episode 300.

501
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:23,423
And I'll have even more gray hair

502
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,142
and bigger circles under my eyes.

503
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,577
I'm here for the early bird special.

504
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:30,514
MacFARLANE: <i>A</i> Family Guy <i>movie would be a logical extension.</i>

505
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:33,734
<i>But, with an animated show, you can do pretty much anything.</i>

506
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,018
There's nothing you can't do.

507
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,320
So what is the reason to make a movie?

508
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:39,089
<i>Without giving anything away,</i>

509
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,208
<i>I think we've hit on the answer to that.</i>

510
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:44,211
<i>So when that Family Guy movie does come around,</i>

511
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:45,779
sufficeth to say,

512
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,167
it will be something that is not do-able on TV.

513
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:54,204
(FARTS)

514
00:20:54,238 --> 00:20:56,356
Sorry. It's been building up for a while.

515
00:20:56,824 --> 00:21:00,026
I don't have a favorite character at this point.

516
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:03,029
<i>I'm recoding voices so much.</i>

517
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:06,099
Hiya, pardner. I'm a cattle rustler.

518
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,767
I rustle cattle.

519
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:09,052
Oh, that's turning out good.

520
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:10,871
I'm partial to Brian.

521
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:13,140
Brian. Brian Steele.

522
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:15,041
Ooh, good heavens!

523
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:21,281
He's the only character that I don't leave the booth with a sore throat.

524
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:23,450
Seems to me you should send less time working for the paper

525
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,986
and more time working on that novel you've been working on...

526
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,120
Ah!
