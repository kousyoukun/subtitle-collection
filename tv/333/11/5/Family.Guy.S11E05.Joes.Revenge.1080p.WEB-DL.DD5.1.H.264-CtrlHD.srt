Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,370
新闻插播 在逃通缉犯Bobby"衬衫"Briggs
This just in: Wanted fugitive, Bobby "The Shirt" Briggs,

终于被逮捕了

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,280
引用一位警方发言人的话
A police spokesperson was quoted as saying,

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,670
"咄 我是个傻警察

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,570
我想要给Tom Tucker开张罚单"
I like to give Tom Tucker a ticket."

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,240
我都要41岁了好么
I was going, like, 41.

20
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,240
天啊 我不敢相信
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.

21
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,510
他们终于抓住那杂种Briggs了
They finally got that son of a bitch, Briggs.

22
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,510
你认识那家伙
You know that guy?

23
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,280
我当然认识
You're damn right, I do.

24
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,180
Bobby Briggs就是那个让我待在轮椅上的人
Bobby Briggs is the one who put me in this wheelchair.

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,780
他们抓到他了
They got him.

26
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,250
他们终于抓住他了
They finally got him.

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,880
天啊 Joe 你没事吧
Geez, Joe, you okay?

28
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,560
给 用我的手绢吧
Here, use my handkerchief.

29
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,840
又湿又冷啊
It's wet and cold.

30
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,440
呃 是啊 因为是我的手绢嘛
Well, yeah, it's my handkerchief.

31
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,240
我整天用它擤鼻子的
I've been blowing my nose in it all day.

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,450
等等 Bobby Briggs是弄残你的人
Wait a minute, Bobby Briggs is the one who crippled you?

33
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,150
你一直是跟我们说你是从房顶上摔下来的
You always told us you fell off a roof

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,320
是在和鬼精灵的一次打斗中
during a fight with the Grinch.

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,320
破坏圣诞的绿皮精灵 S01E05提到过

36
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,520
我撒谎了
I lied.

37
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,750
我撒谎是因为我对实际情况感到羞愧
I lied because I was ashamed of the real story:

38
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,220
因为我让一个穷凶极恶的罪犯逃掉了
that I let a vicious criminal get away.

39
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,290
怎么回事
What happened?

40
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,760
那是1996年
Well, it was 1996.

41
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,680
Briggs是普罗维斯登斯东部最大的海洛因贩子之一
Briggs was one of the biggest heroin dealers

42
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,210
在差不多靠近河边的地方
east of Providence, which is mostly just open water,

43
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,300
但我仍然在卧底跟踪他的行动
but still, I'd been undercover, tracking his operation

44
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,770
持续了六个月 最终得到了他的信任
for six months and had finally gained his confidence.

45
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,360
我已经基本上收集到了足够的证据
I had almost gathered enough evidence

46
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,990
一劳永逸地解决Briggs
to put Briggs away for good,

47
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,350
但我知道一段坦白的录音
but I knew a taped confession

48
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,780
会让这案子更加稳妥
would make the case a slam dunk.

49
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
这样我们就能更上一个台阶了
This is gonna take us to the next level.

50
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,790
我们就能上各种辣妹了
We're gonna be banging so many hot chicks

51
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,490
穿着露脐牛仔裤的那种
with jeans up to their navels.

52
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,660
Bobby Briggs 你还真是对海洛因在行
Bobby Briggs, you're really good at heroin.

53
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,890
这里有多少海洛因 Bobby Briggs
How much heroin is here, Bobby Briggs?

54
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,330
你为什么用那种口吻
Why are you talking like that?

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,160
你带窃听器了吗
Are you wearing a wire?

56
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,830
噢 你死定了 Joe Swansonson
Oh, you're dead, Joe Swansonson.

57
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,030
我的卧底名字叫Swansonson
My undercover name was Swansonson.

58
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,370
别激动 Briggs
Easy, Briggs.

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,770
你杀了警察的话 就等着终身监禁吧
You kill a cop, they'll put you away forever.

60
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,540
那你就准备好下半辈子
Then get ready to spend the rest of your life

61
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,080
做个老婆声音很恼人的瘸腿残废吧
as a lame gimp with an annoying-voiced wife.

62
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,240
他见过Bonnie
He'd met Bonnie.

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,570
Briggs跑了
Briggs got away,

64
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,320
我坐上轮椅后就再也没见过他
and I've been in this wheelchair ever since.

65
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,270
我喜欢你能讲一个
I like that you can tell me a story

66
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,370
从醉蚌酒吧开始到摩天轮才结束的故事
starting at the Clam and ending on a Ferris wheel.

67
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,670
没错 非洲的人还在挨饿
Yeah, people are starving in Africa,

68
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,060
我却在嘉年华
and I'm at a carnival

69
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,440
和我的好哥们一起享受美好的夜晚
with my best buddies on a beautiful night.

70
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,200
谢谢主的赐福
Blessings. Blessings.

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,900
这么说 Joe 你一定感觉很棒吧 他们终于
So, Joe, it must feel great to finally

72
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,640
了结了Bobby Briggs这个案子

73
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,940

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,210
知道么 昨晚是我15年来首次
You know last night was the first time in 15 years

75
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,760
没有在梦中掐过Bonnie
I didn't strangle Bonnie in my sleep?

76
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,430
好吧
Okay.

77
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,400
哎 爸 这个你一定要看看
Hey, Dad, you're gonna want to see this.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,790
重新关注我们的重大新闻
Again recapping our breaking news,

如果你真相信的话

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,610
(西语)逃了 逃了 逃了
Escapo! Escapo! Escapo!

据报道 Briggs是在监狱开放日期间逃走的

86
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,940
此类活动未来很可能会被取消
an event that will most likely be canceled in the future.

87
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,570
不 不要 我不敢相信啊
No, no! I can't believe it.

88
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,240
噢 别担心 他们会把他抓回来的
Oh, don't worry, Joe, they'll get him back.

89
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,440
不会的
No, they won't!

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,840
他们花了15年才抓到他
It took 15 years to catch him.

91
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,150
现在是个出去的好时机
Well, this seems like a good time to be heading out.

92
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,460
我本来就该回去了的
I should be getting back anyway.

93
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,030
我把Rupert留给个保姆照看了
I left Rupert with a sitter.

94
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,470
呃 你知道东西都放在哪儿
Well, you know where everything is.

95
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,670
冰箱里的东西请自便
Feel free to help yourself to anything in the fridge.

96
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,540
这里的骗子先生可以吃布丁或者冰淇淋 但不能都吃
And Mr. Con Man here can have pudding or ice cream, not both.

97
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,000
头儿 能谈谈么
Chief, can I have a word?

98
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,960
可以 但首先 你得承认
Yeah, but first, you have to agree

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,500
双性恋男人和
there's a huge difference

100
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,640
同性恋男人是有很大差别的
between bisexual men and homosexual men.

101
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,240
- 当然了 头儿 - 非常谢谢你
- Sure, Chief. - Thank you. Huge.

102
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,970
什么事
What is it?

103
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,510
头儿 其实我来是因为我希望你
Well, Chief, I'm here because I want you

104
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,870
能让我加入Briggs的案子
to put me on the Briggs case.

105
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,010
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,840
别这样啊 头儿
Come on, Chief!

107
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,110
我知晓Briggs的一切
I know everything about Briggs.

108
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,150
我是唯一能抓住他的人
I'm the only one who can catch him.

109
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,280
不行 Swanson 这案子和你牵涉太多
No, Swanson, you're too close to the case.

110
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,120
我让Grant和Casey来处理这案子
I'm putting Officers Grant and Casey on it

111
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,850
因为他们和这案子的联系不大
because they're so far from the case,

112
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,350
他们完全不在乎
they don't care about it at all.

113
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,190
- 嗨 头儿 - 嗨
- Hi, Chief. - Hi.

114
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,360
这不公平
This isn't fair!

115
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,030
Swanson 你知道你的任务
Swanson, you know your assignment.

116
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,730
你给我抓来那个在唐恩都乐店子里
You get me the guy who's been rubbing his butt

117
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,730
美国连锁快餐店

118
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,400
到处摩擦屁股的家伙
all over Dunkin' Donuts.

119
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,660
有什么需要吗
Can I help you?

120
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,100
不犯法 不犯法
Not illegal. Not illegal.

121
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,830
出示法律呀 不犯法
Show me the law. Not illegal.

122
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,870
嘿 Joe 听着 我知道你对
Hey, Joe, look, I know you're down

123
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,240
Briggs这件事挺难过 这也让我很不好受
about this Briggs thing, and that kind of bums me out,

124
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,890
所以我买了个帕斯曲奇给你
so I got you this Cookie Puss.

125
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,890
一个用冰激凌蛋糕做的人物

126
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,250
是不是很搞笑
Isn't that funny?

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,050
看那奇怪的鼻子呀
Look at that weird nose.

128
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,420
我觉得你的鼻子才怪呢
I think your nose is weird.

129
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,150
伙计们 我想说 我...
Guys, I'm telling you, I...

130
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,420
我不认为我能继续让Briggs
I just don't think I could live with Briggs

131
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,490
再逃窜个15年
on the lam for another 15 years.

132
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,290
那你为什么不做点什么
Well, why don't you do something about it?

133
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,560
我什么也不能做 头儿不允许
I can't do anything about it. The chief won't let me.

134
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,890
Joe 如果他们找不到这家伙
Joe, if they don't find this guy,

135
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,100
你下半辈子会难受得像被活活吞掉
it's gonna eat you alive for the rest of your life.

136
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,730
你必须要亲自出手
You got to take matters into your own hands.

137
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,070
你必须要追捕这家伙
You got to go after this guy.

138
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,930
但这违反了警察的规章制度啊
But that's a breach of police protocol.

139
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,640
这和你是不是警察无关
This isn't about you as a cop.

140
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,140
这是关于作为男人的你
This is about you as a man.

141
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,840
来吧 你怎么说
Come on, what do you say?

142
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,130
Quagmire和我会帮你将这家伙绳之以法的
Quagmire and I will help you bring this guy to justice.

143
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,390
Peter 我是怎么和你说
Peter, what did I say

144
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,460
关于你"自愿"我参加这种鬼事的
about you volunteering me for (bleep)?

145
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,600
好 我们干吧
All right, let's do it!

146
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,280
如果你们打算这么干
Well, if you're gonna do it,

147
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,050
你们就需要一个特别会伪装的人
you're gonna need someone who's very good at disguise.

148
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,620
是谁在说话
Who said that?

149
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,620
我很想和你们一起去 但我不能
I'd love to go with you, but I can't.

150
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,260
我要装成礼物台
I'm supposed to be the gift table

151
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,230
参加明天一个酒吧成人礼
at a Bar Mitzvah tomorrow.

152
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,080
好吧 如果我们要追踪Briggs
All right, if we're gonna go after Briggs,

153
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,020
从这里开始就挺不错
this might be a good place to start.

154
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,260
我花了之前的15年
I've spent the last 15 years

155
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,780
来收集他的信息
gathering information on him,

156
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,410
全都在这里了
and it's all here.

157
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,300
他犯下的所有罪行 他所有的合伙人...
Every crime he's committed, every associate he's...

158
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,860
噢 看啊 Briggs曾经是全国县级资浅游泳代表队的
Oh, look, Briggs was All-County JV swimming.

159
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,700
呃 我对这些屁事不感兴趣
Well, I don't just focus on the negative.

160
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,070
Joe 你25岁的儿子和你的小女儿共用一间房
Joe, your 25-year-old son and your baby daughter share

161
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,610
这样你就能空出一个《美丽心灵》里的变态房间么
a room just so you can keep a weirdo Beautiful Mind room?

162
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,610
2001年电影 其中也有一间类似的房间

163
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,240
这是不是太奇怪了
Isn't that a little bizarre?

164
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,980
然后我们从那家伊拉克人的头骨里把子弹挖了出来
And then we dug the bullets out of that Iraqi family's skulls

165
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,810
这样他们就不能追踪到我们了
so they couldn't be traced back to us.

166
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,450
今天我看见一个气球
MAN'S VOICE: Today, I saw a balloon.

167
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,880
FBI的Briggs档案里说这么多年与他来唯一
Briggs' FBI profile says the only relationship

168
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,690
还有联系的就是一个叫Tanya的脱衣舞女了
he's maintained over the years is with a stripper named Tanya.

169
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,190
税务记录显示她正在
Tax records show she currently works

170
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,790
一家亚特兰大城的俱乐部工作
at a club in Atlantic City.

171
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,030
所以那是我们的第一站
So that's our first stop.

172
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,630
那家俱乐部有身体接触么
Is there touching at the club?

173
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,030
我-我不知道 Peter 也许吧
I-I-I don't know, Peter. Maybe.

174
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,700
好 很好 很好
Okay, this is good, this is good.

175
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,770
那我肯定要把我的惹火牛仔裤也带上
I'll be sure to pack my blemming jeans.

176
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,370
听着 谢谢你答应
Hey, listen, thanks for agreeing

177
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,670
在我离开时照顾"公主"(意大利语) Lois
to take care of Principessa while we're gone, Lois.

178
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,710
这是我们的荣幸
It's our pleasure.

179
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,180
她看上去是只可爱的小猫
She looks like a nice kitty.

180
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,710
呃 小猫
Uh, kitty?

181
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,380
Lois 她可是纯种波斯猫
Lois, she is a purebred Persian.

182
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,450
我可以追溯她的血统到埃及艳后养的猫
I can trace her lineage to the cats kept by Cleopatra.

183
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,320
那你告诉我该怎么做就行了 Glenn
Just tell me what I need to do, Glenn.

184
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,150
好 首先 她的肠道非常活跃
Well, first, she has a very active bowel.

185
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,060
在用纸尿布方面不要太吝啬了
You can't be too generous with the baby wipes.

186
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,370
要从前面到后面这样擦拭就像你对自己一样
Stroke front to back like you would on yourself.

187
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,690
否则你就会把屎弄到她的生殖器里
Otherwise, you're smashing feces into her genitals.

188
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,940
另外 她很容易受惊
Also, she's very skittish,

189
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,910
所以你只能这样摸她
so you have to touch her like this.

190
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,650
我现在要抚摸你了哦
I'm going to touch you now.

191
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,850
可以吗
Is that okay?

192
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,670
看到我是怎么做的了
See how I'm going?

193
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,610
慢慢的 慢慢的
Slowly, slowly.

194
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,580
哦 那存于你体内的神秘感
Oh, the mysteries you keep inside of you.

195
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,960
Quagmire 快点 我们走
PETER: Quagmire, come on, let's go.

196
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,900
好吧 我想我们该出发了
All right, I guess we're off.

197
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,200
嘿 伙计们 看看
Hey, you guys, check out the look

198
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,830
我这么做时Lois的表情
on Lois's face when I do this.

199
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,970

200
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,070

爱你哟
Love you.

202
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,790
[进入康涅狄格州]

203
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,120
哇 最终永远铐住Briggs的时候
Boy, it'll be satisfying to finally slap the cuffs

204
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,900
我一定会非常满足的
on Briggs once and for all.

205
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,900
你们有没有驶过一座小镇 然后产生
Hey, you ever just drive through a town and wonder,

206
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,040
- "到底是谁住在这地方"的想法 - 一直如此
- "Who the hell lives here?" - All the time.

207
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,240
看看这里 我是说 怎-怎么回事啊
Look at this place. I mean, what-what's going on?

208
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,290
这有个成年人在买柠檬水
There's an adult with a lemonade stand.

209
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,960
那家中国餐馆还留着
That Chinese restaurant still has the sign

210
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,250
以前汽修工的招牌
from when it was a mechanic.

211
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,720
我可不想在换消音器的地方
I don't want to eat lo mein

212
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,300
吃着拌面
where they were just changing mufflers.

213
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,800
那家阿比快餐店的楼上有间公寓
There's an apartment above that Arby's.

有人在那上面建立了一个家

真是一团糟
What a mess.

218
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,190
我告诉你 开国元勋们一定会
I'm telling you, the Founding Fathers would be

219
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,090
无比失望地看到他们的国家变成现在这样
very disappointed in where their country ended up.

220
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,260
呃 过去也没那么好的
Eh, it wasn't so perfect back then, either.

221
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,070
所以我对你们说
And so I say unto you,

222
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,800
自由之子们 自由的人们将不会再

生活在大型食肉鸟类的枷锁之下

Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Call somebody! Oh!

279

我们需要一张
We need one of those boards

280
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,650
给足球运动员的那种板 嗷

没什么
Nothing.

283
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,960
我刚发现为何猫比婴儿好了
I just figured out why cats are better than babies.

284
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,960
你那只是个宽泛的说法
Well, that's kind of a broad statement.

285
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,650
好了 海洋大道2820号 就是这儿
Okay, 2820 Ocean, this is it.

We'll just pick the lock.

288
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,080

What? What is that?

289
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,770
让我们用自己的眼睛来看
Let's use our eyes to see.

290

His mom must be so cool.

292

他还有个垃圾压缩机
And he's got a trash compactor.

293

完全压实了
It compacted it all.

294
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,160

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,940
等等 你...你不记得我了
Wait, you... you don't remember me?

300

我潜伏进了你的海洛因团伙
I infiltrated your heroin operation.

301
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,980
我们还一起看过《现实的创痛》

302

1994年本斯蒂勒自导自演的电影

He went that way!

305
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,820
妈的 是Lois
Damn it. That's Lois.

306
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,790
我不接的话 她会杀了我的
If I don't get this, she's going to kill me.

307
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,180
嗨 甜心
Hi, sweetie.

308
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,310

我和你一样愤慨
I'm as angry as you are.

312

Peter 我要掉下去了
Peter, I'm going to fall!

313
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,130
看来你无处可逃了
It looks like you're out of roof.

314
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,140
妈的 没路过去了
Damn it. There's no way across.

315

Spidey, can you swing us across with your web?

316
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,250
不 我不能荡你过去
No, I can't swing you across.

317
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,050
而且我叫蜘蛛侠 不叫小蛛蛛
And it's Spider-Man, not Spidey.

318
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,950
我很确定听人这么叫过你
I'm pretty sure I've heard people call you Spidey.

319
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,420
没错 好朋友
Yeah, close friends.

- 噢 我不喜欢这样 - 是吧 你不喜欢
- Oh, I don't like that. - Yeah, you don't like it.

323
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,530
你就是个肥屌丝 而我是他妈的蜘蛛侠
And you're a fat nobody, and I'm (bleep) Spider-Man,

324
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,400
你觉得我怎么想
so how do you think I feel?

325
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,670
他要跑了 把我从边上扔下去
He's getting away. Guys, drop me over the side!

326
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,840
你疯了么 Joe
Are you crazy, Joe?!

327
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,190
你会死掉的
That fall will kill you.

328
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,220
只要我用腿着陆就不会
Not if I land on my legs.

329
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,810
小心
Heads up.

330
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,030
我现在抓到你了 Briggs
I got you now, Briggs.

移开那公交车
Move that bus!

332
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,180
恶搞真人秀《彻底改变之家庭再造》

333
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,740
享受你们的新家吧
Enjoy your new home.

334

他跑了 伙计们
He's gone, you guys!

335
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,840
我本来抓到他了
I had him!

336
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,410
那是我们仅有的机会
That was our one chance!

337
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,550
没关系的 Joe
It's all right, Joe.

338
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,980
你没什么好惭愧的
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

339
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,020
你是个很棒的警察
You're a great cop

340
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,320
有着非常杰出的职业生涯
with a very distinguished career.

341
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,850
你还抓到了那个杀死
You caught that guy who was killing

342
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,020
所有菲律宾女孩的家伙
all those Filipino girls.

343
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,790
是啊 但这很重要
Yeah, but this was important!

344
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,590
他毁了我的一生
This was the guy who ruined my life.

345
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,890
这变态对我来说就是全部
The one perv who meant everything to me.

346
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,240
如果我抓住他
If I caught this guy,

347
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,980
我才能睡个踏实觉
I'd finally be able to sleep at night.

348
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,100
妈的
Damn it!

349
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,580
哦 谢天谢地 警察
Oh, thank God. Cops.

350
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,620
噢 太好了
Oh, good.

351
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,850
你们仍然能抓住Briggs
You guys can still catch Briggs.

352
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,950
他朝那边跑了
He's headed that way.

353
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,150
我们不是来抓他的
We're not here for him.

354
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,290
我们是来找你们的
We're here for you guys.

355
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,760
你们现在因妨碍
You're under arrest for interfering

356
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,320
警方调查被捕了
with a police investigation.

357
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,490
什么
What?

358
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,790
是啊 搞毛呢
Yeah, what the hell?

359
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,960
你们应该在外面去逮捕真正的罪犯
You should be out there arresting the real criminals.

360
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,260
就像挥舞弹簧刀的白人
Like switchblade-wielding white guys

361
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,070
出现在影视剧中 他们还不说人话
from movies and TV who don't talk like people talk.

362
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,400
别怕 老妈子
Easy, mama.

363
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,850
交出钱包 还有所有
Hand over that purse, and everything

364
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,900
很酷的玩意 你的懂
will be real cool, you dig?

365
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,870
伙计们 你得让我们离开这儿
Guys, you got to let us out of here.

366
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,070
真的罪犯要逃走了
The real criminal's getting away.

367
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,740
是啊 那坏蛋要逃掉了
Yeah, the bastard's making a break for it,

368
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,520
就像南美洲一样
just like South America.

369
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,840
嗯
Hmm.

370
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,270
那边有好多黑哥们儿
Lot of black guys over there.

371
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,830
嘿 兄弟 你去哪
Hey, man, where you going?

372
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,830
恶搞了古代冈瓦纳大陆的分裂

373
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,230
我会回来的 我就回来
I'll be back. I'm coming back.

374
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,510
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

375
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,080
为何警察要逮捕我们
Why would the cops arrest us

376
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,220
而不是去追捕Briggs呢
instead of going after Briggs?

377
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,350
Flannigan 慢着
Flannigan? Wait a minute.

378
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,560
那个就是在Briggs逃跑的15年里
That's one of the corrupt cops who helped harbor Briggs

379
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,560
一直包庇他的坏警察
while he was on the lam for 15 years.

380
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,930
这些家伙可麻烦了
These guys are bad news.

381
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,090
天啊
Oh, my God.

382
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,750
他们准备把我们怎么办
What are they going to do to us?

383
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,600
我不准备待在这儿等答案了
We're not going to stick around to find out.

384
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,400
Joe 把你的手铐放我腿上
Joe, hold your handcuffs over my lap.

385
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,700
那是啥玩意儿
What the hell is that?

386
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,040
瑞士军鸡
Swiss Army penis.

387
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,220
哇 Quagmire 屌爆了啊
Wow, Quagmire. That's incredible.

388
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,520
Peter?

389
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,290
你这是用更结实的金属做的
Yours are made of a stronger metal.

390
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,400
我们要用乙炔喷灯鸡鸡了
We're going to have to go with the acetylene torch penis.

391
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,900
不...不要直视
Don't... don't look right at it.

392
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,880
我的性病让它烧的更亮
My STDs help it burn brighter.

393
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,070
钥匙就在点火孔里 走
The keys are in the ignition. Let's go!

394
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,490
我告诉过你搜那人的鸡鸡的
I told you to search that guy's penis.

395
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,580
每个人你都这么说过
You say that about everybody.

396
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,780
- 吔 我们成功了 - 但我们跟丢了Briggs
- Yeah, we did it! - But we lost Briggs.

397
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,420
我们现在要怎么找到他呢
How are we going to find him now?

398
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,670
我们没有任何线索啊
We got nothing.

399
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,670
呃 我不知道是否有用 但我找到了
Well, I don't know if it helps, but I found

400
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,470
这个号码 就在他厨房的电话机旁
this number next to the phone in his kitchen.

401
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,560
我本来想留着做
I was saving it 'cause I was going to make

402
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,140
一本和你们一起旅行的剪贴簿的
a scrapbook of the trip for you guys.

403
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,390
让我看看
Let me see that.

404
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,630
这是墨西哥华瑞兹市的区号
This is the area code for Juarez, Mexico.

405
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,300
他准备越境
He's trying to get over the border!

406
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,260
- 你真这么想 - 绝对的
- You think so? - Definitely.

407
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,770
这里只有一条路通往华瑞兹市
There's only one road into Juarez,

408
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,350
而且穿过埃尔帕索
and it goes through El Paso.

409
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,350
美国得克萨斯州西部城市 其实两市间有4个过境站

410
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,020
我们要先到埃尔帕索
We got to get to El Paso.

411
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,350
Joe 你怎么会知道
Joe, how do you know

412
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,910
墨西哥华纳兹市区号的
the area code for Juarez, Mexico?

413
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,860
我去那瞧过一个干细胞医生
There was a stem cell doctor I went down there to see.

414
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,890
但他只是在我腿上擦了什么洋葱辣汁
He just rubbed, like, salsa on my legs.

415
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,970
嘿 你们没穿制服
Hey, you're not in uniform.

416
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,740
你们是警察么
Are you guys cops?

417
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,440
你们是警察么
Are you guys cops?

418
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,950
他们发现我们不是警察了
They know we're not cops!

419
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,750
[亚特兰大城 国际机场]

420
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,980

422
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,750
但是Briggs在我们前头啊
But Briggs is ahead of us.

423
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,050
他会不会已经到那儿了
Won't he already be there?

424
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,090
不会的 他绝不会冒险通过机场的
No, he'd never risk going through an airport.

425
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,500
有太多警察和摄像头
Too many cops, too many cameras,

426
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
还有保安了
too much security.

427
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,740
我不确定 Joe
I don't know, Joe.

428
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,470
有时候保安真的很懒散的
Sometimes the security's pretty lax.

429
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,680
我是说 我上次乘的飞机就被基佬打劫了
I mean, the last plane I was on got gay-jacked.

430
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,380

是啊 瞧 她睡着了
Yeah. And look, she fell asleep

435
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,780
猫也在她胸口上睡着了
with the cat right on her chest.

436
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,190
是不是很萌啊

喵
Meow.

438
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,260
我以为你睡着了
I think you're dreaming.

439
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,410
没有
No, I'm not.

天 真他妈热

嘿 我有个点子
Hey, I got an idea.

444
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,850
我们来做滚烫沥青版天使吧
Let's make scalding asphalt angels.

445
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,850
"做天使"指躺在雪地中用身体蹭出天使状的印痕

446
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,300
嗷 嗷 嗷 嗷 嗷 嗷 嗷

Second-degree burns; first-degree fun.

448
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,760
天 我们还要在这儿站多久

449
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,890
直到Briggs过来
Till Briggs comes through.

450
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,590
知道么 我正在想这事儿 Joe
You know, I was thinking about that, Joe.

451
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,060
如果Briggs是开车过来 那差不多要2000英里了
If Briggs is driving here, that's like 2,000 miles.

452
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,200
至少得要好几天啊
It's going to be at least a couple of days.

453
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,980
嗯 我想你说的对
Huh. I guess you're right.

454
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,500
那我们这两天在埃尔帕索干嘛呢
Well, what are we going to do for two days in El Paso?

455

有一个奇卡诺民俗节

凯西与阳光合唱团会到场演出

460
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,840
为什么
Why?

461
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,310
或者我们可以参观潘兴故居
Or we could visit the Pershing House

462
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,010
约翰潘兴于1914年在那里

妈的 他要跑了
Damn it! He's getting away!

483

I've waited 15 years for this moment, Briggs.

488
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,620
你知不知道
Do you have any idea what it's like

489
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,530
每天要把自己弄进轮椅的感觉
to have to lift yourself into a wheelchair every morning?

490
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,210
在你老婆眼中只是半个男人

494
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,300
好吧 也不是那么糟

但我不会杀了你

我可不是像你一样的禽兽
I'm not an animal like you.

497
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,440
那你准备干吗 逮捕我

我不会逮捕瘸子

另外 你被捕了
By the way, you're under arrest.

501

我说这话只是因为它很酷罢了
I only said that last thing 'cause it seemed cool.

502
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,170

你就像这样...
You were all like...

505
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,610

然后你再像这样...

噢 日 他死了
Oh, crap, he's dead.

我想他血流光了
I think he bled out.

511
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,370
我一定是打中他股动脉了
I must have hit the femoral artery.

512
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,590
啊 那我们就把他踢到墨西哥吧

You risked your lives for me,

515
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,710
没有你们我是做不成这事的

516
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,370
嘿 好朋友不就是该这样吗
Hey, that's what pals are for.

是啊 谢谢让我
Yeah, and thanks for letting me

518
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,420
朝Briggs的尸体开了几枪
fire a few rounds into Briggs's corpse.

519
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,420

That was the most powerful I've felt in a couple years.

我感觉就像一个崭新的人 就像我重生了
I feel like a new man-- like I'm reborn.

523
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,650
Joe 你裤腿里有血流出来了
Joe, you have blood just pouring out of your pant leg.

524
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,240
嗯 我有个蛋在河里爆了
Yeah, I had a ball blow in the river.
