12
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:37,213
All right, I'm going
to the store.

13
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:38,381
Anybody need anything?

14
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:41,284
Yeah, can you get me a chess set
and a backwards hat?

15
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:43,019
I got some inner-city
school kids

16
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:44,420
I gotta inspire tomorrow.

17
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:46,939
Okay, Darius,
point to the king.

18
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:53,296
That's right.
It's you.

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,847
Hey, Lois. Doesn't, uh,
somebody have

20
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,365
a birthday coming up
this week?

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,584
Oh, it's nice of you
to remember, Brian,

22
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,987
but, frankly, I'd rather
let this one slip by.

23
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,406
I don't need to be reminded
how old I'm gettin'.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,724
You know, it's funny.

25
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:06,692
You keep so busy
with your kids,

26
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:08,327
time just seems
to slip away,

27
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:10,546
and then you turn
around one day and...

28
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:12,348
Okay, bye.
Stop making noise.

29
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:17,470
You know, Peter, I know
Lois is downplaying it,

30
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:19,255
but I think she might
actually appreciate it

31
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:20,656
if we threw her
a party.

32
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:22,425
Maybe even
a surprise party.

33
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:23,876
That's a great
idea, Brian!

34
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,127
Yeah, I love parties.

35
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:27,530
I mean, I had a great time
at my baby shower.

36
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:29,181
Well, after opening all
these gifts,

37
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:31,317
I could use a little wine
right now myself.

38
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,935
Glug,
glug, glug, glug.

39
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,421
Can you imagine?!

40
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:41,377
I'm sorry. My hormones are
just crazy right now!

41
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:53,356
Stewie, you want
a Mommy rocket ride?

42
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,557
What?
What do you mean?

43
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:56,359
Here we go!
Get ready for blastoff!

44
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:58,844
Ow! Son of a bitch!

45
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:01,847
Oh, my God, Stewie,
are you all right?

46
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:04,450
Nice throw,
Casey Anthony.

47
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:08,521
Oh, my God, I hope the guys
at Sears portrait studio

48
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,423
will be able to retouch this.

49
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:11,624
What am I saying?

50
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:13,826
Of course they will.
They're Sears.

51
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,394
What the deuce?

52
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:16,629
Well, hello there.

53
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:18,614
I say, you're
a cute little fellow.

54
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:21,734
Tell me something: What do you
think about Rose McGowan?

55
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:23,819
Yeah, she makes
my turtlehead go in, too.

56
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:25,738
How about Michelle Rodriguez?

57
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,540
Yeah, me too, kinda, right?

58
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,458
You know, she's got
like a cute tomboy thing

59
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:31,711
where you feel like you could
play softball with her,

60
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,879
and then later on,
give her the old sau-seege.

61
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:35,114
I like you.

62
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:37,249
I can tell we're going
to be good friends.

63
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:40,753
We've got that unspoken bond
that all bald guys have.

64
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,874
I thought
he'd never leave.

65
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:46,092
Me neither.

66
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,631
Yeah.

67
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,185
Aw, did you guys
just do the thing?

68
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:02,174
Okay, we'll see you soon.
Bye. All right, you guys,

69
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,744
that was Lois. She's gonna be
here in ten minutes.

70
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:07,346
Dad, how did you get Mom out of
the house so we could decorate?

71
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:08,948
Well, Chris, I constructed

72
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:11,717
a very elaborate
fake grocery store.

73
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:13,502
Oh, my God!

74
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:15,871
Are these pickles really
only 39 cents?!

75
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:16,939
That's right, ma'am.

76
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:19,575
Wow! This is incredible!

77
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:25,581
What the hell's
going on here?

78
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:30,936
And over here are my toys.

79
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,639
This is my fire truck,
my Slinky, my Silly Putty.

80
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:35,274
You know, Silly Putty's
awesome,

81
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:38,043
but you know what's
really cool? Serious Putty.

82
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:40,996
Oh, this looks
like fun!

83
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:43,466
It says I have cancer.

84
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,201
We thought it would be better

85
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:47,169
if you heard it
from chemicals in an egg.

86
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,320
Hey, Stewie,
you better come down.

87
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,321
The party's
about to start.

88
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:51,257
What is that?
Is that a turtle?

89
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,292
Yes, Brian.
I found him at the park.

90
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,593
I named him Sheldon.

91
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:56,762
Oh, and get this:
I brought him home today,

92
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:58,731
and coincidentally
this is the day

93
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:00,599
Rupert started
working out again.

94
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:02,368
So transparent.

95
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:04,136
Rupert?
What happened to your eye?

96
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:06,288
Brian, did you pull
one of Rupert's eyes off?

97
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:07,823
No. Why would I do that?

98
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:09,058
Maybe your
turtle did it.

99
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:10,693
Nonsense. Sheldon
is a gentle soul.

100
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:11,994
He wouldn't hurt anybody.

101
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:13,562
Well, come on.
Let's get downstairs.

102
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:14,963
Lois will be here
any minute.

103
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:33,833
Surprise!

104
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,835
Yay!
Birthday!

105
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:37,603
Oh, my God!

106
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:38,938
Happy birthday,
Lois!

107
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:40,689
You guys shouldn't
have done this!

108
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:43,692
Hey, anytime you can celebrate
the end of someone's periods.

109
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:46,061
Everyone, everyone,
I have something to say.

110
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:49,648
To my dearest Lois
on her birthday.

111
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:51,750
What a journey
we've had together.

112
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:54,753
You know, life has a way
of changing things.

113
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:57,556
What were once two firm,
impressive mountain peaks

114
00:04:57,591 --> 00:05:00,493
have become a barren,
strip-mined, muddy landslide

115
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:02,094
that droops ever downward.

116
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:04,864
What were once pink
and succulent rose petals

117
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:07,199
now take the form
of the shredded, raggedy,

118
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:11,036
blown-out endpiece of a
practical joker's exploding cigar.

119
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:12,171
Peter, that-
that's enough.

120
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:13,806
Lois, you may not be

121
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,641
the young filly you were
when I met you,

122
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:18,143
but you're still my
reliable old plow horse

123
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:19,445
who's there each day

124
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,413
to pull the plow,
to help around the barn,

125
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:24,650
and let the husband horse-slap
a batch at her now and then.

126
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:26,852
Well, I guess that's it.

127
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:28,120
I love you, sweetheart.

128
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:30,956
And I have a lovely gift
of the batchslapping variety

129
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:33,359
waiting for you when I'm just
the right amount of drunk.

130
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:34,376
To Lois!

131
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:35,578
To Lois!

132
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,083
Lois!
Mom!

133
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:42,618
Geez, what the hell's
her problem?

134
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:44,553
Peter, she was already
feeling insecure about her age,

135
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:46,889
and then you went and gave her
that horrible speech!

136
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:47,957
I don't blame her.

137
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:50,059
Nobody likes to be
humiliated in public.

138
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:51,427
I'm King Stewie!

139
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:53,212
I rule with
an iron fist!

140
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:56,916
La, la-la, la-la la-la!
Look at me! Ooh!

141
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,084
In my office. Now.

142
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:04,056
Hey, any of you guys
seen your mother?

143
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,507
She never came
to bed last night,

144
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,775
and I can't find
her anywhere.

145
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:09,895
What the hell?

146
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,083
♪

147
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:21,140
Hey, sluts!

148
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:24,243
OMG, stop staring at me,
please-'kay-thanks.

149
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:25,945
Mom, are you okay?

150
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,479
Lois, what's goin' on?

151
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,198
I'm what's
goin' on, Peter.

152
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:31,367
I got highlights,
I went shopping,

153
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:32,968
and I had my...

154
00:06:33,003 --> 00:06:35,971
So it's tighter now.

155
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:39,258
Peter, I think Lois might be
having a midlife crisis.

156
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:42,027
Come on, dudes!
Who wants to hop in my wheels

157
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:44,830
and head to the beach
for some ultimate Frisbee?

158
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:48,183
Yeah, Sheldon, I'm with you.

159
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:55,441
I can't... I can't do that.

160
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,317
Hey, tweeps!

161
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:04,985
JK, I don't follow you,
you're lame.

162
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,155
But look who just got
herself a sick new tat.

163
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,191
Oh, my God, Mom!

164
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:12,243
I know,
I can't believe it either.

165
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:15,146
I guess one of my flaws
is I'm just kinda brave.

166
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,647
No, that's great actually,
because now

167
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:19,884
anyone walking behind you
will know that you had $60.

168
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:21,652
Wow! That is awesome, Lois!

169
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:23,454
Your bum looks like
an NBA guy's arm.

170
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:25,422
'Cept it's not payin'
someone to install

171
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:27,158
a PlayStation in a car.

172
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,859
Lois, you do know
that's permanent?

173
00:07:28,894 --> 00:07:30,094
Good. Then that means

174
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:32,429
my ass is gonna
look young forever.

175
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:39,687
Guys, I, uh, I gotta go
shoot one into the sink.

176
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:40,855
What's going on?

177
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,057
Mom's acting and dressing
like a 20-year-old.

178
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:44,642
I know, and I'm
worried about her.

179
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:46,760
You can't just pretend
to be something you're not.

180
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:48,946
Yes, just ask
Edward Scissorhands.

181
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,449
Okay, now, I'm an excellent
night nurse, so you two get

182
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:55,553
some much-deserved sleep
and don't worry about a thing.

183
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:58,989
I will take such loving care
of this wonderful little gift.

184
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,691
And when you wake up,
well-rested,

185
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:03,227
your precious little baby
will be smiling

186
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:04,929
as bright as the sun.

187
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:08,032
It's dead.

188
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:13,837
And while I remind you
I can't read yet,

189
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:15,806
I can only imagine
Madeline would say,

190
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,375
"Take me out of this
disgusting French hospital

191
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,944
and find me some
real parents."

192
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:22,046
Ah! Paper cut!

193
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,380
A razor blade?!

194
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:27,001
Who the hell uses a razor blade
as a bookmark?!

195
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:30,654
All right,
very funny, Stewie.

196
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,072
What?
What do you mean, what?

197
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:34,308
You replaced my Jack Daniels
with flat Diet Coke.

198
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:35,593
No, I didn't.

199
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:38,095
And you're noticing this
at 8:20 in the morning?

200
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,363
What has happened
to your life?

201
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:40,698
Do you need to talk?

202
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:42,233
Just stay away
from my booze!

203
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:43,367
It wasn't me, Brian.

204
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:44,618
Well, if it wasn't you,
who was it?

205
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:45,869
I mean, there's a lot
of weird stuff

206
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:47,004
going on
around here lately.

207
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:49,290
Just yesterday, somebody gave
Peter a "hotbutt."

208
00:08:49,324 --> 00:08:51,542
♪ La, la, la, la, la,

209
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:53,794

la, la, la, la, l... ♪

210
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:56,931
And then somebody replaced
Meg's sleeping pills

211
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:58,232
with Alka-Seltzer.

212
00:09:00,268 --> 00:09:02,303
People are gonna miss me
when I'm...

213
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:06,957
Well, I'm sure there's a
perfectly logical explanation

214
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:08,008
for those things.

215
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:09,610
Sometimes you just...

216
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:11,895
Whoa, that was close.

217
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,298
Yeah, how'd
that thing fall over?

218
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:21,722
Okay, who replaced
my glasses with forks?

219
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:23,390
I mean, they're real good
for seeing forks

220
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:25,059
but not much else.

221
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,898
Peter, can you come down
to the laundry room?

222
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,032
Ugh, son of a bitch.

223
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:33,567
If she washed
my belt again,

224
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,437
I am gonna hit her
with my dry, withered belt.

225
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:37,638
What is it, Lois?

226
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:38,939
I was watching...

227
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:42,676
Whoa, Lois, what the
hell are you doing?

228
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:46,080
Do me, Peter, do me right here
in the basement.

229
00:09:46,114 --> 00:09:49,183
Y-You mean this room we're in
or your bum?

230
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:52,353
No, this room, Peter,
right here on the carpet.

231
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:53,587
Oh, so you mean the front.

232
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:55,406
Just get over here
and kiss me.

233
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,525
Let's have sex on all
the clean, folded laundry.

234
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,312
Wow, Lois, I got to say,
I like this new you.

235
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:02,479
I like it a lot.

236
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:06,784
Oh, Peter!

237
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:08,686
Oh, Peter, yes!
Yeah.

238
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,354
Oh, I'm on fire.
Yeah.

239
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:12,423
Take me, you filthy bastard.
Yeah, oh.

240
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:13,924
Destroy me and this laundry.
Oh, yeah.

241
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,293
Yeah, here, put Meg's
bra in your mouth.

242
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:18,329
Oh, my God,
that's so disturbing.

243
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:19,830
I know, gross.

244
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,265
Yeah, and my hearing's
a lot better,

245
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:24,001

Sheldon. What are you doing?

262
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:39,126
Get back in your bowl
where you belong.

263
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:46,917
Well, long as I'm up, I might
as well go spit in Lois's mouth.

264
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:51,755
Sheldon?

265
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,183
Come on, Stewie.

266
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:04,885
He's just a little turtle.

267
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,920
He can't hurt you.

268
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:29,960
Get out!

269
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:00,423
Isn't this epic, Peter?

270
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:02,609
That DJ has got
some mad skills.

271
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:04,978
You think they
sell Anacin at the bar?

272
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:05,979
Come on.

273
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,698
Get up and dance
with me, Peter.

274
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:09,066
This place is sick.

275
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,167
Hells yeah!

276
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:12,636
It is the only
rooftop pool in Providence.

277
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,005
No offense, but this
place is awesome.

278
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,790
I-I-- Where was
I supposed to be offended

279
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:17,824
within that remark?

280
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:19,293
Can we, can we leave, Lois?

281
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:20,827
Actually, we are leaving.

282
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:23,163
We're hitting another
insane party across town.

283
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:24,498
What, you mean now?

284
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:26,567
Peter, you sound
like an old fart.

285
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:28,902
I thought you liked
having a hot, young wife.

286
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:31,805
Well, I did at first,
but the novelty's worn off.

287
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,008
Same thing happened with
that blog I started on 9/11.

288
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:50,040
Look, Peter,
you do what you want to do,

289
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:51,508
but I'm going to that party.

290
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,710
My life isn't over.
It's just beginning.

291
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:56,213
So if you don't want
to run with the wild horses,

292
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:58,899
then go back to the barn
and go to bed.

293
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:01,401
But, Lois...

294
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:06,373
Stupid place still doesn't
have my dry cleaning.

295
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:08,809
That's not a dry cleaners.
It's a dance club.

296
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:09,977
It is?

297
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,246
Well, that explains a lot.

298
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:16,350
Oh, this is my jam!

299
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:26,652
Jeez, Peter, you
look terrible.

300
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:28,254
I know.
Lois has been wearing me out.

301
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:29,689
I just can't keep up with her.

302
00:14:29,723 --> 00:14:31,491
I don't know what
she's trying to prove, Brian,

303
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:32,692
but I can't take it anymore.

304
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:33,860
Peter, can't you see?

305
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:35,294
She's doing this
because of <i>you.</i>

306
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:37,296
For God's sake, you
called her a plow horse.

307
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:39,665
It's no wonder she's trying to
prove she's young and vibrant.

308
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,234
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

309
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:42,902
The city of Quahog
has been stricken

310
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:44,771
with a case of Bieber Fever
tonight,

311
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:47,707
as teen idol and fake black guy
Justin Bieber

312
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:50,243
is in town for a sold-out show
at the Quahog Civic Center.

313
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:51,644
We now go live

314
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:53,846
to Asian correspondent
Tricia Takanawa with more.

315
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:55,548
Tom, I'm standing here

316
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:57,233
at the Quahog Civic Center,

317
00:14:57,284 --> 00:15:00,920
awash in a pool
of prepubescent sexual moisture.

318
00:15:00,954 --> 00:15:03,973
Woo-hoo!
We love you, Justin!

319
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:05,291
Look!
That's Mom!

320
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:07,026
Oh, my God!
What the hell?

321
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:08,661
She's at
a Justin Bieber concert?

322
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:10,863
Ugh, Justin Bieber's
so yesterday.

323
00:15:10,898 --> 00:15:13,132
I'm all about
Quentin Vashay now.

324
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,534
Who's Quentin Vashay?

325
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:15,902
Exactly.

326
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:16,903
What's going on?

327
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:19,105
Do we have to get
a new mom now?

328
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,106
No, Chris.

329
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,924
I'm gonna go get
our old mom back.

330
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,960
If I'm the one
who made her feel this way,

331
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,828
then I'm the one
who's got to fix it.

332
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,447
Brian, keys!

333
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:28,881
Chris, beer!

334
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,883
Meg, ugly!

335
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:34,771
Mm-hmm. Yes.

336
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:36,305
Yes, I see.

337
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,807
Rupert, the man
from the newspaper

338
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:40,343
would like a quote from you
about my dancing abilities.

339
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:41,677
Rupert?

340
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:44,130
Where'd you go?

341
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:46,165
Magnolia Cupcakes?

342
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:50,203
Rupert! Oh, my God!

343
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,671
Oh, my God, no!

344
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:54,240
If he did this to you,
I swear I'll kill him!

345
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:57,243
And what's that box from
Bloomingdale's doing here?

346
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:03,132
I, uh, I-I don't know
who this is.

347
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,928
Oh, my God, he is so adorable.

348
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:18,097
I could just bite him
and eat him up.

349
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:19,649
I know, he's perfect.

350
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,317
He's like a boy
and a girl.

351
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:22,735
I know!

352
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:31,661
Sorry, you're not
allowed in here.

353
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:33,095
Oh, yeah?

354
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:35,681
I'm not into that.

355
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:36,749
Oh.

356
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:38,551
Well, what
are you into?

357
00:16:38,585 --> 00:16:39,952
Pinkberry.

358
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,170
I love my job.

359
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:43,723
Yum, yum, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum.

360
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:47,793
Hey, there, cutie.

361
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:49,662
Oh, hey. How's it going?

362
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,614
Um, are you a friend
of my mom's?

363
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:56,536
Yeah. I'm your mom's friend,
Mrs. Robinson.

364
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,104
I don't... I don't get that.

365
00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:59,472
Is that a reference
to something?

366
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:00,740
Uh, okay.

367
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:03,376
Uh, I'm, uh-- oh,
I'm Stifler's mom.

368
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,877
Still no idea.

369
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:06,812
Okay, just get
your pants off, hon.

370
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:08,714
Stop right there!
Get away from her!

371
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:09,815
Peter?!
Who are you?

372
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,050
How'd you get in here?

373
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:14,203
Step away from my wife,
you acorn-penised beauty!

374
00:17:14,238 --> 00:17:16,038
Look, I swear.
Nothing happened.

375
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:17,240
Just relax, old man.

376
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:18,758
Old man?!

377
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,844
What, you think you're not gonna
get old, you little bastard?!

378
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:23,863
And, Lois, I've had
enough of you, too!

379
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:26,098
Now, you come home
and start acting your age!

380
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:28,067
No, Peter. I don't
want to act my age,

381
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:29,602
and you don't
want that either.

382
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:32,305
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
called me an old plow horse.

383
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:33,890
Look, I didn't mean
to say that.

384
00:17:33,924 --> 00:17:35,141
I-I was a jerk.

385
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:36,909
But isn't this
what you want?

386
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:39,295
Don't you want me to
stay young and exciting?

387
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:40,563
Well, I thought I did.

388
00:17:40,614 --> 00:17:42,365
I mean, every guy
who's been married a while

389
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,816
thinks he wants
a hot, young chick,

390
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,785
but after you spend an hour
with one of them,

391
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:47,153
you want to blow
your brains out.

392
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:50,389
But, Peter, I was just
doing this to make you happy.

393
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:52,124
You do make me happy, Lois.

394
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:54,527
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

395
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:55,861
That's sweet.

396
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:58,598
But you got to admit,
I'm not what I used to be.

397
00:17:58,632 --> 00:17:59,732
Well, neither am I.

398
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,102
I used to be
a lion tamer.

399
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:05,238
Look, Lois,
I'll always treasure

400
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:07,840
the wild, little hottie
I met when I was young.

401
00:18:07,874 --> 00:18:10,042
But I don't want to be
with a kid anymore.

402
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,679
I want a smart, sexy, beautiful,
middle-aged companion.

403
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,547
I want the real Lois.

404
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:16,749
My Lois.

405
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:18,484
Oh, Peter.

406
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:24,874
Mr. Bieber, they're
calling for an encore!

407
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:28,711
Oh, my God, those kids
are expecting a show.

408
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:30,096
I'll handle this.

409
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:37,703
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Conway Bieber.

410
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:42,241
♪ People see us everywhere

411
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:46,345
♪ They think you really care

412
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,800
♪ But myself I can't deceive

413
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:56,856
♪ I know it's only
make-believe... ♪

414
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,794
Well, well,
look who has surfaced.

415
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:24,533
You're getting colder.

416
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,884
Hey, get out here
and fight me!

417
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,483
Damn it!

418
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:07,893
Now batting:
Stewie Griffin!

419
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:11,097
Oh, crap.

420
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:23,576
Ugh, you look like
a nude Larry David.

421
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,778
No, no, no!

422
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:28,597
Oh, my God, Super Mario?

423
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:30,066
What are you doing here?

424
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,801
I jump on a turtle, Stewie.

425
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:35,237
It's not an exciting life,
but it's my life.

426
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:40,409
It sure is good to
have you back, Mom.

427
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:42,011
Yeah, we missed you.

428
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:44,113
Well, thanks for putting up
with me, you guys.

429
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:46,749
Sorry I got so flipped out
about my age.

430
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:48,317
Aw, don't worry
about it, Lois.

431
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:49,819
But from now on,
remember:

432
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:52,221
I love you just
the way you are.

433
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:54,557
And besides, there's nothing
wrong with being 35.

434
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:56,926
Peter, I'm 43.

435
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,761
Get out of this house.

436
00:20:58,786 --> 00:21:03,786
