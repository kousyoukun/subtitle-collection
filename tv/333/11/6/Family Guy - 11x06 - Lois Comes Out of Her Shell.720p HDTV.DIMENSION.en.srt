12
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,212
All right, I'm going
to the store.

13
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,380
Anybody need anything?

14
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:41,283
Yeah, can you get me a chess set
and a backwards hat?

15
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:43,018
I got some inner-city
school kids

16
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:44,419
I gotta inspire tomorrow.

17
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:46,938
Okay, Darius,
point to the king.

18
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:53,295
That's right.
It's you.

19
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:54,846
Hey, Lois. Doesn't, uh,
somebody have

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,364
a birthday coming up
this week?

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,583
Oh, it's nice of you
to remember, Brian,

22
00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:00,986
but, frankly, I'd rather
let this one slip by.

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,405
I don't need to be reminded
how old I'm gettin'.

24
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,723
You know, it's funny.

25
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:06,691
You keep so busy
with your kids,

26
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:08,326
time just seems
to slip away,

27
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:10,545
and then you turn
around one day and...

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,347
Okay, bye.
Stop making noise.

29
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:17,469
You know, Peter, I know
Lois is downplaying it,

30
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:19,254
but I think she might
actually appreciate it

31
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,655
if we threw her
a party.

32
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,424
Maybe even
a surprise party.

33
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,875
That's a great
idea, Brian!

34
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,126
Yeah, I love parties.

35
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:27,529
I mean, I had a great time
at my baby shower.

36
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:29,180
Well, after opening all
these gifts,

37
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,316
I could use a little wine
right now myself.

38
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,934
Glug,
glug, glug, glug.

39
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,420
Can you imagine?!

40
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:41,376
I'm sorry. My hormones are
just crazy right now!

41
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,355
Stewie, you want
a Mommy rocket ride?

42
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:54,556
What?
What do you mean?

43
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,358
Here we go!
Get ready for blastoff!

44
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:58,843
Ow! Son of a bitch!

45
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:01,846
Oh, my God, Stewie,
are you all right?

46
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:04,449
Nice throw,
Casey Anthony.

47
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:08,520
Oh, my God, I hope the guys
at Sears portrait studio

48
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:10,422
will be able to retouch this.

49
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:11,623
What am I saying?

50
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:13,825
Of course they will.
They're Sears.

51
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:15,393
What the deuce?

52
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:16,628
Well, hello there.

53
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:18,613
I say, you're
a cute little fellow.

54
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:21,733
Tell me something: What do you
think about Rose McGowan?

55
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:23,818
Yeah, she makes
my turtlehead go in, too.

56
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,737
How about Michelle Rodriguez?

57
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,539
Yeah, me too, kinda, right?

58
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:29,457
You know, she's got
like a cute tomboy thing

59
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,710
where you feel like you could
play softball with her,

60
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:33,878
and then later on,
give her the old sau-seege.

61
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:35,113
I like you.

62
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:37,248
I can tell we're going
to be good friends.

63
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:40,752
We've got that unspoken bond
that all bald guys have.

64
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,873
I thought
he'd never leave.

65
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:46,091
Me neither.

66
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,630
Yeah.

67
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,184
Aw, did you guys
just do the thing?

68
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,173
Okay, we'll see you soon.
Bye. All right, you guys,

69
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,743
that was Lois. She's gonna be
here in ten minutes.

70
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:07,345
Dad, how did you get Mom out of
the house so we could decorate?

71
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,947
Well, Chris, I constructed

72
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,716
a very elaborate
fake grocery store.

73
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:13,501
Oh, my God!

74
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,870
Are these pickles really
only 39 cents?!

75
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:16,938
That's right, ma'am.

76
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:19,574
Wow! This is incredible!

77
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:25,580
What the hell's
going on here?

78
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:30,935
And over here are my toys.

79
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,638
This is my fire truck,
my Slinky, my Silly Putty.

80
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,273
You know, Silly Putty's
awesome,

81
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:38,042
but you know what's
really cool? Serious Putty.

82
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:40,995
Oh, this looks
like fun!

83
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,465
It says I have cancer.

84
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:45,200
We thought it would be better

85
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,168
if you heard it
from chemicals in an egg.

86
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:48,319
Hey, Stewie,
you better come down.

87
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,320
The party's
about to start.

88
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,256
What is that?
Is that a turtle?

89
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,291
Yes, Brian.
I found him at the park.

90
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:54,592
I named him Sheldon.

91
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:56,761
Oh, and get this:
I brought him home today,

92
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:58,730
and coincidentally
this is the day

93
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:00,598
Rupert started
working out again.

94
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,367
So transparent.

95
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:04,135
Rupert?
What happened to your eye?

96
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,287
Brian, did you pull
one of Rupert's eyes off?

97
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:07,822
No. Why would I do that?

98
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,057
Maybe your
turtle did it.

99
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:10,692
Nonsense. Sheldon
is a gentle soul.

100
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:11,993
He wouldn't hurt anybody.

101
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:13,561
Well, come on.
Let's get downstairs.

102
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:14,962
Lois will be here
any minute.

103
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:33,832
Surprise!

104
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,834
Yay!
Birthday!

105
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,602
Oh, my God!

106
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:38,937
Happy birthday,
Lois!

107
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:40,688
You guys shouldn't
have done this!

108
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:43,691
Hey, anytime you can celebrate
the end of someone's periods.

109
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:46,060
Everyone, everyone,
I have something to say.

110
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:49,647
To my dearest Lois
on her birthday.

111
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:51,749
What a journey
we've had together.

112
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:54,752
You know, life has a way
of changing things.

113
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:57,555
What were once two firm,
impressive mountain peaks

114
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,492
have become a barren,
strip-mined, muddy landslide

115
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:02,093
that droops ever downward.

116
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,863
What were once pink
and succulent rose petals

117
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:07,198
now take the form
of the shredded, raggedy,

118
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:11,035
blown-out endpiece of a
practical joker's exploding cigar.

119
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,170
Peter, that-
that's enough.

120
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,805
Lois, you may not be

121
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,640
the young filly you were
when I met you,

122
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:18,142
but you're still my
reliable old plow horse

123
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:19,444
who's there each day

124
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:21,412
to pull the plow,
to help around the barn,

125
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,649
and let the husband horse-slap
a batch at her now and then.

126
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:26,851
Well, I guess that's it.

127
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:28,119
I love you, sweetheart.

128
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:30,955
And I have a lovely gift
of the batchslapping variety

129
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,358
waiting for you when I'm just
the right amount of drunk.

130
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:34,375
To Lois!

131
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,577
To Lois!

132
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,082
Lois!
Mom!

133
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:42,617
Geez, what the hell's
her problem?

134
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:44,552
Peter, she was already
feeling insecure about her age,

135
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:46,888
and then you went and gave her
that horrible speech!

136
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:47,956
I don't blame her.

137
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,058
Nobody likes to be
humiliated in public.

138
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,426
I'm King Stewie!

139
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,211
I rule with
an iron fist!

140
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:56,915
La, la-la, la-la la-la!
Look at me! Ooh!

141
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:59,083
In my office. Now.

142
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:04,055
Hey, any of you guys
seen your mother?

143
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:05,506
She never came
to bed last night,

144
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,774
and I can't find
her anywhere.

145
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:09,894
What the hell?

146
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:14,082
♪

147
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:21,139
Hey, sluts!

148
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,242
OMG, stop staring at me,
please-'kay-thanks.

149
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:25,944
Mom, are you okay?

150
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:27,478
Lois, what's goin' on?

151
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,197
I'm what's
goin' on, Peter.

152
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:31,366
I got highlights,
I went shopping,

153
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,967
and I had my...

154
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:35,970
So it's tighter now.

155
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:39,257
Peter, I think Lois might be
having a midlife crisis.

156
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,026
Come on, dudes!
Who wants to hop in my wheels

157
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:44,829
and head to the beach
for some ultimate Frisbee?

158
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:48,182
Yeah, Sheldon, I'm with you.

159
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:55,440
I can't... I can't do that.

160
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:03,316
Hey, tweeps!

161
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:04,984
JK, I don't follow you,
you're lame.

162
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:08,154
But look who just got
herself a sick new tat.

163
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:10,190
Oh, my God, Mom!

164
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:12,242
I know,
I can't believe it either.

165
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:15,145
I guess one of my flaws
is I'm just kinda brave.

166
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:16,646
No, that's great actually,
because now

167
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,883
anyone walking behind you
will know that you had $60.

168
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,651
Wow! That is awesome, Lois!

169
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:23,453
Your bum looks like
an NBA guy's arm.

170
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,421
'Cept it's not payin'
someone to install

171
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:27,157
a PlayStation in a car.

172
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:28,858
Lois, you do know
that's permanent?

173
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:30,093
Good. Then that means

174
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:32,428
my ass is gonna
look young forever.

175
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:39,686
Guys, I, uh, I gotta go
shoot one into the sink.

176
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,854
What's going on?

177
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:43,056
Mom's acting and dressing
like a 20-year-old.

178
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,641
I know, and I'm
worried about her.

179
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:46,759
You can't just pretend
to be something you're not.

180
00:07:46,794 --> 00:07:48,945
Yes, just ask
Edward Scissorhands.

181
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,448
Okay, now, I'm an excellent
night nurse, so you two get

182
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:55,552
some much-deserved sleep
and don't worry about a thing.

183
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:58,988
I will take such loving care
of this wonderful little gift.

184
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:00,690
And when you wake up,
well-rested,

185
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:03,226
your precious little baby
will be smiling

186
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,928
as bright as the sun.

187
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:08,031
It's dead.

188
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:13,836
And while I remind you
I can't read yet,

189
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:15,805
I can only imagine
Madeline would say,

190
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,374
"Take me out of this
disgusting French hospital

191
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:19,943
and find me some
real parents."

192
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:22,045
Ah! Paper cut!

193
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,379
A razor blade?!

194
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:27,000
Who the hell uses a razor blade
as a bookmark?!

195
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,653
All right,
very funny, Stewie.

196
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:32,071
What?
What do you mean, what?

197
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:34,307
You replaced my Jack Daniels
with flat Diet Coke.

198
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:35,592
No, I didn't.

199
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:38,094
And you're noticing this
at 8:20 in the morning?

200
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:39,362
What has happened
to your life?

201
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:40,697
Do you need to talk?

202
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,232
Just stay away
from my booze!

203
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:43,366
It wasn't me, Brian.

204
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,617
Well, if it wasn't you,
who was it?

205
00:08:44,652 --> 00:08:45,868
I mean, there's a lot
of weird stuff

206
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:47,003
going on
around here lately.

207
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:49,289
Just yesterday, somebody gave
Peter a "hotbutt."

208
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:51,541
♪ La, la, la, la, la,

209
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:53,793

la, la, la, la, l... ♪

210
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:56,930
And then somebody replaced
Meg's sleeping pills

211
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,231
with Alka-Seltzer.

212
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,302
People are gonna miss me
when I'm...

213
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:06,956
Well, I'm sure there's a
perfectly logical explanation

214
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:08,007
for those things.

215
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,609
Sometimes you just...

216
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:11,894
Whoa, that was close.

217
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:14,297
Yeah, how'd
that thing fall over?

218
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,721
Okay, who replaced
my glasses with forks?

219
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:23,389
I mean, they're real good
for seeing forks

220
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:25,058
but not much else.

221
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:30,897
Peter, can you come down
to the laundry room?

222
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,031
Ugh, son of a bitch.

223
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:33,566
If she washed
my belt again,

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,436
I am gonna hit her
with my dry, withered belt.

225
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,637
What is it, Lois?

226
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:38,938
I was watching...

227
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:42,675
Whoa, Lois, what the
hell are you doing?

228
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,079
Do me, Peter, do me right here
in the basement.

229
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:49,182
Y-You mean this room we're in
or your bum?

230
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:52,352
No, this room, Peter,
right here on the carpet.

231
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:53,586
Oh, so you mean the front.

232
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,405
Just get over here
and kiss me.

233
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:58,524
Let's have sex on all
the clean, folded laundry.

234
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,311
Wow, Lois, I got to say,
I like this new you.

235
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:02,478
I like it a lot.

236
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,783
Oh, Peter!

237
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:08,685
Oh, Peter, yes!
Yeah.

238
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,353
Oh, I'm on fire.
Yeah.

239
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:12,422
Take me, you filthy bastard.
Yeah, oh.

240
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:13,923
Destroy me and this laundry.
Oh, yeah.

241
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:16,292
Yeah, here, put Meg's
bra in your mouth.

242
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:18,328
Oh, my God,
that's so disturbing.

243
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:19,829
I know, gross.

244
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:21,264
Yeah, and my hearing's
a lot better,

245
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:24,000

Sheldon. What are you doing?

262
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:39,125
Get back in your bowl
where you belong.

263
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:46,916
Well, long as I'm up, I might
as well go spit in Lois's mouth.

264
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:51,754
Sheldon?

265
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,182
Come on, Stewie.

266
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:04,884
He's just a little turtle.

267
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,919
He can't hurt you.

268
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,959
Get out!

269
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:00,422
Isn't this epic, Peter?

270
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,608
That DJ has got
some mad skills.

271
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:04,977
You think they
sell Anacin at the bar?

272
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:05,978
Come on.

273
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:07,697
Get up and dance
with me, Peter.

274
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,065
This place is sick.

275
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:10,166
Hells yeah!

276
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,635
It is the only
rooftop pool in Providence.

277
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:15,004
No offense, but this
place is awesome.

278
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:16,789
I-I-- Where was
I supposed to be offended

279
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:17,823
within that remark?

280
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,292
Can we, can we leave, Lois?

281
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:20,826
Actually, we are leaving.

282
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:23,162
We're hitting another
insane party across town.

283
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:24,497
What, you mean now?

284
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:26,566
Peter, you sound
like an old fart.

285
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,901
I thought you liked
having a hot, young wife.

286
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:31,804
Well, I did at first,
but the novelty's worn off.

287
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:35,007
Same thing happened with
that blog I started on 9/11.

288
00:13:47,888 --> 00:13:50,039
Look, Peter,
you do what you want to do,

289
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:51,507
but I'm going to that party.

290
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,709
My life isn't over.
It's just beginning.

291
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:56,212
So if you don't want
to run with the wild horses,

292
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:58,898
then go back to the barn
and go to bed.

293
00:13:58,932 --> 00:14:01,400
But, Lois...

294
00:14:03,904 --> 00:14:06,372
Stupid place still doesn't
have my dry cleaning.

295
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:08,808
That's not a dry cleaners.
It's a dance club.

296
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:09,976
It is?

297
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,245
Well, that explains a lot.

298
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:16,349
Oh, this is my jam!

299
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,651
Jeez, Peter, you
look terrible.

300
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:28,253
I know.
Lois has been wearing me out.

301
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:29,688
I just can't keep up with her.

302
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:31,490
I don't know what
she's trying to prove, Brian,

303
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:32,691
but I can't take it anymore.

304
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:33,859
Peter, can't you see?

305
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:35,293
She's doing this
because of <i>you.</i>

306
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:37,295
For God's sake, you
called her a plow horse.

307
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,664
It's no wonder she's trying to
prove she's young and vibrant.

308
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:41,233
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

309
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:42,901
The city of Quahog
has been stricken

310
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:44,770
with a case of Bieber Fever
tonight,

311
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:47,706
as teen idol and fake black guy
Justin Bieber

312
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,242
is in town for a sold-out show
at the Quahog Civic Center.

313
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:51,643
We now go live

314
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:53,845
to Asian correspondent
Tricia Takanawa with more.

315
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,547
Tom, I'm standing here

316
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:57,232
at the Quahog Civic Center,

317
00:14:57,283 --> 00:15:00,919
awash in a pool
of prepubescent sexual moisture.

318
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:03,972
Woo-hoo!
We love you, Justin!

319
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:05,290
Look!
That's Mom!

320
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:07,025
Oh, my God!
What the hell?

321
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,660
She's at
a Justin Bieber concert?

322
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:10,862
Ugh, Justin Bieber's
so yesterday.

323
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:13,131
I'm all about
Quentin Vashay now.

324
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,533
Who's Quentin Vashay?

325
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:15,901
Exactly.

326
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:16,902
What's going on?

327
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:19,104
Do we have to get
a new mom now?

328
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:20,105
No, Chris.

329
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,923
I'm gonna go get
our old mom back.

330
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,959
If I'm the one
who made her feel this way,

331
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:25,827
then I'm the one
who's got to fix it.

332
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:27,446
Brian, keys!

333
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,880
Chris, beer!

334
00:15:28,915 --> 00:15:30,882
Meg, ugly!

335
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:34,770
Mm-hmm. Yes.

336
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:36,304
Yes, I see.

337
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:37,806
Rupert, the man
from the newspaper

338
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:40,342
would like a quote from you
about my dancing abilities.

339
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:41,676
Rupert?

340
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:44,129
Where'd you go?

341
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:46,164
Magnolia Cupcakes?

342
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,202
Rupert! Oh, my God!

343
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:51,670
Oh, my God, no!

344
00:15:51,704 --> 00:15:54,239
If he did this to you,
I swear I'll kill him!

345
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:57,242
And what's that box from
Bloomingdale's doing here?

346
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:03,131
I, uh, I-I don't know
who this is.

347
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,927
Oh, my God, he is so adorable.

348
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:18,096
I could just bite him
and eat him up.

349
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:19,648
I know, he's perfect.

350
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:21,316
He's like a boy
and a girl.

351
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:22,734
I know!

352
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:31,660
Sorry, you're not
allowed in here.

353
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:33,094
Oh, yeah?

354
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:35,680
I'm not into that.

355
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:36,748
Oh.

356
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:38,550
Well, what
are you into?

357
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:39,951
Pinkberry.

358
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:41,169
I love my job.

359
00:16:41,204 --> 00:16:43,722
Yum, yum, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum.

360
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:47,792
Hey, there, cutie.

361
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:49,661
Oh, hey. How's it going?

362
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:51,613
Um, are you a friend
of my mom's?

363
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:56,535
Yeah. I'm your mom's friend,
Mrs. Robinson.

364
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:58,103
I don't... I don't get that.

365
00:16:58,137 --> 00:16:59,471
Is that a reference
to something?

366
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:00,739
Uh, okay.

367
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:03,375
Uh, I'm, uh-- oh,
I'm Stifler's mom.

368
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:04,876
Still no idea.

369
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,811
Okay, just get
your pants off, hon.

370
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:08,713
Stop right there!
Get away from her!

371
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:09,814
Peter?!
Who are you?

372
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,049
How'd you get in here?

373
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,202
Step away from my wife,
you acorn-penised beauty!

374
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:16,037
Look, I swear.
Nothing happened.

375
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:17,239
Just relax, old man.

376
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:18,757
Old man?!

377
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,843
What, you think you're not gonna
get old, you little bastard?!

378
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:23,862
And, Lois, I've had
enough of you, too!

379
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:26,097
Now, you come home
and start acting your age!

380
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,066
No, Peter. I don't
want to act my age,

381
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,601
and you don't
want that either.

382
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:32,304
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
called me an old plow horse.

383
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:33,889
Look, I didn't mean
to say that.

384
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:35,140
I-I was a jerk.

385
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:36,908
But isn't this
what you want?

386
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:39,294
Don't you want me to
stay young and exciting?

387
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:40,562
Well, I thought I did.

388
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:42,364
I mean, every guy
who's been married a while

389
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:43,815
thinks he wants
a hot, young chick,

390
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:45,784
but after you spend an hour
with one of them,

391
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:47,152
you want to blow
your brains out.

392
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:50,388
But, Peter, I was just
doing this to make you happy.

393
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:52,123
You do make me happy, Lois.

394
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,526
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

395
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,860
That's sweet.

396
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:58,597
But you got to admit,
I'm not what I used to be.

397
00:17:58,631 --> 00:17:59,731
Well, neither am I.

398
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,101
I used to be
a lion tamer.

399
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,237
Look, Lois,
I'll always treasure

400
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:07,839
the wild, little hottie
I met when I was young.

401
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:10,041
But I don't want to be
with a kid anymore.

402
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:13,678
I want a smart, sexy, beautiful,
middle-aged companion.

403
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,546
I want the real Lois.

404
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:16,748
My Lois.

405
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:18,483
Oh, Peter.

406
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:24,873
Mr. Bieber, they're
calling for an encore!

407
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,710
Oh, my God, those kids
are expecting a show.

408
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:30,095
I'll handle this.

409
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,702
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Conway Bieber.

410
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:42,240
♪ People see us everywhere

411
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:46,344
♪ They think you really care

412
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:50,799
♪ But myself I can't deceive

413
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:56,855
♪ I know it's only
make-believe... ♪

414
00:19:14,957 --> 00:19:18,793
Well, well,
look who has surfaced.

415
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:24,532
You're getting colder.

416
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:41,883
Hey, get out here
and fight me!

417
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:57,482
Damn it!

418
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:07,892
Now batting:
Stewie Griffin!

419
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:11,096
Oh, crap.

420
00:20:20,673 --> 00:20:23,575
Ugh, you look like
a nude Larry David.

421
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:25,777
No, no, no!

422
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:28,596
Oh, my God, Super Mario?

423
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:30,065
What are you doing here?

424
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:31,800
I jump on a turtle, Stewie.

425
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:35,236
It's not an exciting life,
but it's my life.

426
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,408
It sure is good to
have you back, Mom.

427
00:20:40,443 --> 00:20:42,010
Yeah, we missed you.

428
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:44,112
Well, thanks for putting up
with me, you guys.

429
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:46,748
Sorry I got so flipped out
about my age.

430
00:20:46,782 --> 00:20:48,316
Aw, don't worry
about it, Lois.

431
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,818
But from now on,
remember:

432
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:52,220
I love you just
the way you are.

433
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:54,556
And besides, there's nothing
wrong with being 35.

434
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,925
Peter, I'm 43.

435
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,760
Get out of this house.
