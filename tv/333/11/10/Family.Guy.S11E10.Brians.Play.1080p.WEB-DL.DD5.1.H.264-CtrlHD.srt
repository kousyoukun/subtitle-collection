1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,820
It seems today that all you see

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,320
Is violence in movies and sex on TV 

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,670
But where are those good old-fashioned values 

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,530
On which we used to rely?

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,810
Lucky there's a family guy

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,570
Lucky there's a man who positively can do 

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,370
All the things that make us

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,850
Laugh and cry

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,390
He's... a... fam... ily... guy! 

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,410
布莱恩的剧
Brian's Play

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,440
即兴爱人--Brian Griffin

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,950
哇哦 真为Brian感到兴奋
Wow, I'm so excited for Brian.

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,620
记住 孩子们 如果剧很糟糕,
Remember, kids-- if it's terrible,

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,090
我们最后就都说 "你做到了!"
at the end, we all say, "You did it!"

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,740
真不敢相信我们在去剧院的路上
I can't believe we're going to the theater

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,300
今天Chris刚把一只老鼠淹死在水坑里
the same day Chris drowned a mouse in a puddle.

17
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,500
我是说 我们不需要一天的时间来冷静一下吗?
I mean, don't we need a day to clear our heads?

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,910
啊 这让我想起了往事
Boy, this takes me back.

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,750
我曾经是 呃…
You know, I was, uh...

20
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,710
是高中时期话剧的一个演员
kind of one of those theater kids in high school.

21
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,350
突然Seymour...
 Suddenly Seymour...

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,700
突然Seymour...
 Suddenly Seymour...

23
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,880
他净化了我
 He purified me

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,950
他净化了你
 He purified you

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,990
突然Seymour...
 Suddenly Seymour...

26
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,930
突然Seymour...
 Suddenly Seymour...

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,800
安德鲁斯夫人 我又拉在花盆里了
Mrs. Andrews, I pooped in the pot again.

28
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,100
我需要人帮我清理一下
I'm gonna need somebody to clean me up.

29
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,640
这次真的很糟糕
It's really bad this time.

30
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,110
哇哦 这么多人
Wow, what a turnout.

31
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,390
哦 嗨 那是Glenn
Oh, hey, there's Glenn.

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,410
嗨 伙计们
Hey, guys.

33
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,780
嗨 这是我今晚的伴Consuela
Hey, this is my date, Consuela.

34
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,790
不 不 不
No, no, no.

35
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,380
好吧 我们只是朋友
Okay, we're here as friends,

36
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,580
不过总有一天我会让你改变主意的
but I'm gonna change your mind one day.

37
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,420
哦 真为Brian感到骄傲
Oh, I'm so proud of Brian.

38
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,140
很难想象他还是曾经那个
It's hard to believe he's the same dog

39
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,520
对着菠萝狂吠四小时的狗
who barked at a pineapple for four hours.

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,760
拉好你的钱包 我都看到你的卫生棉条了
Close your purse. I can see your tampons.

41
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,260
还有为什么你需要六个
And why do you need six?

42
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,260
你究竟经历了什么
What happens to you?

43
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,610
今晚的明星来了
There's the man of the hour.

44
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,770
嘿 Brian 你能想象吗
Hey, Brian, can you believe

45
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,830
我是在公路边上找到这件外套的
I found this blazer on the side of the highway?

46
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,340
谢谢你们能来
Hey, guys. Thanks for coming.

47
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,600
重要的夜晚 Brian 你感觉怎么样
Big night, Brian. How you feeling?

48
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,610
嗯 有点紧张
Well, a little nervous.

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,790
我就希望一切顺利
I just want it to go well.

50
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,840
祝我好运
Fingers crossed.

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,140
有中场休息吗
Will there be an intermission?

52
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,780
因为这会决定我是否
Because that will determine whether or not

53
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,210
带这个空Gatorade饮料瓶进去
I bring this empty Gatorade bottle into the theater.

54
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,610
这真是无法忍受
TOM: This is unacceptable!

55
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,170
抱歉 我得离开了
Sorry, guys, I got to go.

56
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,440
他们没在Tom Tucker的座位上粘遮蔽胶带
They didn't put masking tape over a seat for Tom Tucker

57
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,120
于是他就在那里发飙了
and he's in there pitching a fit.

58
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,190
你知道我是谁么
TOM: Do you know who I am?!

59
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,520
我是Tom Tucker 妈逼的
I'm Tom Tucker, damn it!

60
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,760
我一小时挣的比你两小时挣得还多
I make more in an hour than you make in two hours!

61
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,110
哦 演出要开始了
Oh, the play's about to start.

62
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,800
妈妈 这次的座位适合我的身材吗
Mom, am I going to fit in the seat

63
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,980
还是说会像上次一样杯具
or is this going to be like last time?

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,950
你应该会被卡在这里一段时间了
This should tide you over for a while.

65
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,460
我会尽快回来的
I'll come back as soon as I can.

66
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,230
她不会回来的
She's not coming back, you know.

67
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,460
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

68
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,530
因为她也是我妈妈
'Cause she's my mom, too.

69
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,950
抱歉 这是我的座
Excuse me, that's my seat.

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,860
回家再跟你算账
We'll talk about this at home.

71
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,860
哎 看看谁会在这
Let's see who's in this thing?

72
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,250
杯具 路人
Sad. Nobody.

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,180
杯具 杯具 路人
Sad. Sad. Nobody.

74
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,310

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,310
百老汇著名演员

76
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,410
这个真心不错
That's pretty good.

77
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,750
他怎么请得到Victor...
How did he get Victor...?

78
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,920
哦 怪不得
Oh, of course.

今天来的是Randall Evan Battincourt
Tonight it's Randall Evan Battincourt.

80
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,340
我真讨厌这些替身演员
God, I hate understudies.

81
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,570

放轻松 你将完美地完成任务

86
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,790
搞定
Nailed it.

87
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,020
好了 和往常一样
Well, as usual,

88
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,190
这部剧一定会不讨好我们两个中的一个
this is gonna suck for one of us.

89
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,210
Donna 我是Grant 你的新婚丈夫
Donna? It's Grant, your new husband.

90
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,350

94
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,500
在你兄弟家里
At your brother's house.

95
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,610
我得到了一个在镇里最火的新话剧的试镜

但我们不是住在东北么
But we live in the Northeast.

106
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,700
的确 我们是住在东北

107
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,770
除非我们正要迁往加州

他什么时候才会遇到贝隆夫人？
When he going to meet Evita?

111
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,570
不是每部剧都是贝隆夫人
Not every play is Evita.

112
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,640
哦 不 我觉得糟透了
Oh, no. I feel terrible.

113
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,340
为什么 你不想去吗
Why? Don't you want to go?

114
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,400
不想--我给你买了一件防风夹克
No-- I got you a parka.

115
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,020
这两个人永远都不合拍
Those two are never on the same page.

116
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,090
等着那个眼神...
Wait for the look...

117
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,690
这就是屡试不爽的原因
And that's why it works.

118
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,430
Donna 别走
Donna, don't go!

119
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,270
还不算太晚 我们还可以开始家庭生活
It's not too late. We can still start our family.

120
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
你还不明白吗
Don't you see?

121
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,040
你已经有一个家庭了
You already have a family.

122
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,570
就在那儿
It's right there.

123
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,880
那可不能在夜里温暖你
Those won't keep you warm at night.

124
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,510
再见 Grant
Good-bye, Grant.

125
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,880
挺有意思 不是吗
It's funny, isn't it?

126
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,780
这么多年来 我就是即兴爱人
All these years, I was the passing fancy.

127
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,710
起立 混蛋
Get up, you jerk.

128
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,430
哇哦 棒极了
Wow, that was amazing!

129
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,550
我是说 通常 镇上的演出都烂透了
I mean, usually, the shows suck in this town.

130
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,230
比如Moishe 那个无精打采的犹太成人礼小丑
Like Moishe, the low-energy Bar Mitzvah clown.

131
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,420
哦 这是什么
Ooh, what's this?

132
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,490
一个两角五分硬币
A quarter.

133
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,620
我之前在你耳朵后面发现的
I found it behind your ear earlier.

134
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,620
好了 你已经看过够多的魔术了
All right, that's enough tricks for you.

135
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,160
我要去外套上躺会了
I'm going to go lie down on the coats.

136
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,150
嘿 谁看了演出的点评了吗
Hey, has anybody seen the review yet?

"into modern relationships.

144
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,630
"如果一个成年人只看一部剧
"If you see only one play as an adult,

145
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,340
我推荐你看这一部"
I urge you to see this one."

146
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,640
嘿 你能读一下那页
Hey, can you read that page

147
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,560
都是关于死人的小段落吗
with all the little paragraphs about dead people?

148
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,920
那些超级逗
Those are hilarious.

149
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,880
太好了 Brian 你现在怎么想
This is amazing, Brian. How do you feel?

150
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,440
你走红了
You're a hit!

151
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,750
这真是...难以想象的好
It's... overwhelming.

152
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,880
这就是我一直想要的 你们知道吗
This is all I've ever wanted, you know?

153
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,700
大家赏识并尊重我的作品
For people to appreciate and respect my writing.

154
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,300
我想写一部剧
I want to write a play!

155
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,570
啊 你真可爱 Stewie.
Aw, that's cute, Stewie.

156
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,770
也许有一天
Maybe someday.

157
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,870
不 我是说真的要写一部剧
No, I'm going to write a play.

158
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,240
我会做很多事情
I can do lots of things.

159
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,640
我曾经是《大青蛙布偶秀》的人力资源主管
I was the human resources director for the Muppets.

160
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,740
Beaker先生 我很遗憾
Mr. Beaker, it is my unfortunate task

161
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,280
要通知你
to inform you that your services

162
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,410
不必再来本公司上班了
will no longer be required by this company.

163
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,550
如果你一定要知道
Well, if you must know,

164
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,220
是因为我们发现了大量的
it's because we've noticed large quantities

165
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,790
苯和麻黄素
of benzene, ephedrine

166
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,860
而且每天都有硫酸镁泻药在丢失
and everyday Epsom salt have gone missing.

167
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,190
别辩解了
Oh, please.

168
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,390
我们都知道这些是用来做
We both know those are the ingredients

169
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,890
冰毒的原料
used to make crystal meth.

170
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,300
我还一直在思考
And I've got a pretty good idea

171
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,960
你究竟把冰毒卖给谁
who you've been selling it to as well.

172
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,230
哦 嘿 Beaker
Oh, hey, uh, Beaker,

173
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,630
等你跟朋友谈完之后
when you're done talking to your friend,

174
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,800
我想要 呃 呃...
I want to, uh, eh...

175
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,540
我想和你谈谈那个东西
I want to talk to you about that thing.

176
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,790
嘿 你在做什么
Hey, what you doing?

177
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,590
我正要排练我的新剧
I was going to start rehearsing my new play.

178
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,790
想看看吗
Want to hear it?

179
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,710
哦 你真的写了一部小话剧
Oh, you actually wrote a little play.

180
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,710
哦 我真希望我可以看看
Aw, boy, I wish I could hang out,

181
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,900
只是最近真的是忙疯了
but it has just gotten so crazy.

182
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,550
真的 我知道了 行了吧
Really? I know, right?

183
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,290
我是说 我不是在抱怨
I mean, I'm not complaining, you know?

184
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,360
我只是...我希望我可以重回以前的日子
But I just... I want my old life back.

185
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,670
我是在开玩笑 的确
I'm just kidding, of course.

186
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,410
我真是太开心了
I'm so grateful, you know?

187
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,290
我是说 每场演出都爆满
I mean, every performance is sold out

188
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,760
于是他们又在周三加了一个下午场
and they just added a Wednesday matinee.

189
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,180
很不错
It's great.

190
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,550
是有一个东西因为这件事情
I mean, there's only one thing I'm not getting

191
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,550
让我很无奈
out of this experience.

192
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,750
是什么  睡眠
What's that? Sleep.

193
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,270
不 我真的是非常开心 真的
No, no, I'm so grateful, really.

194
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,170
只是我一直 我一直太忙了
It's just that I'm-I'm so busy all the time.

195
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,440
不过真的很好 都很棒
But it's great. It's all great.

196
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,280
好吧 你觉得你有时间读一下吗
Well, do you think you might have time to read it?

197
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,480
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

198
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,760
但是有耐心点 行不
But be patient, all right?

199
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,400
我这一周排满了面试和出席活动
I've got interviews and appearances all week.

200
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,630
我是说 他们想要榨干
I mean, they're squeezing

201
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,030
我的所有时间和价值
every last drop they can out of me,

202
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,570
就像番茄酱一样
like a bottle of ketchup.

203
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,990
听着 我们已经折腾了15分钟
Listen, we've been at this for 15 minutes.

204
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,610
我不认为还有东西能出来
I don't think anything's coming out.

205
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,240
我还行 我还能等
I'm fine. I can keep going.

206
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,690
我只是太累了
I'm just really tired.

207
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,530
如果我把手指插到你的菊花里怎么样
What if I stick my finger in your hole?

208
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,530
想象一个画面 配上这些台词 自行脑补

209
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,860
呃 只有我快高潮的时候才有用
Eh, that only works when I'm already close.

210
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,550
美国话剧在走下坡路
The American play was dying.

211
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,020
我们-我们是否能让它在这里复苏
Have-have we brought it back to life here?

212
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,590
我不敢打包票 不过确实有起色了
I can't say that, but it has a pulse.

213
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,690
你真的是很牛叉的作家 Brian
You're such an amazing writer, Brian.

214
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,830
你怎么做到的  你写剧本的过程是怎样的
How do you do it? What's your process?

215
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,680
呃 Allison 我该怎么回答这个问题？
Oh, God, Allison, how do I even answer that?

216
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,480
我是说 彩虹诞生的过程是怎样的
Uh, I mean, what's a rainbow's process?

217
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,520
两分雨水 一分阳光 一分孩童的好奇
Two parts rain, one part sun, one part childlike wonder.

218
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,990
不过我们可以肯定的是
What we do know, though,

219
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,330
这两者最后带来的结果都是欢乐
is that the end result in both cases is joy.

220
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,350
哇哦
Wow.

221
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,310
哇哦 这下你觉得离开灯塔值了吧 Seamus
Wow, are you glad you left the lighthouse now, Seamus?

222
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,820
哦 至少我这么觉得 Seamus
Oh, I think so, Seamus!

223
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,870
打扰一下 我注意到您在高谈阔论
Excuse me, I noticed you were talking loud,

224
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,470
这么看来您是个智者
so that means you're smart.

225
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,400
您是否介意-我奢问一句-
But would you mind-- and I hate asking--

226
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,040
您介意为我签名吗
but would you mind signing this?

227
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,810
这个人让你觉得讨厌了吗 Brian
Is this guy giving you a hard time, Brian?

228
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
不 他没关系的
Nah, he's all right.

229
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,940
好的 行 行
All right. Cool, cool.

230
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,240
你怎么样 伙计
How you doing, buddy?

231
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,540
请过目 Stewie Griffin

232
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,140
美国婚姻

233
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,310
（莫扎特第29奏鸣曲）

234
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,930
天啊
My God.

235
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,740
太美妙了
It's miraculous.

236
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,240
靠
(bleep)

237
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,960
嘿 Brian 能读一下我写的剧本吗
Hey, Brian, can you read my play?

238
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,310
对不起 一个屁卡在剧本里了
Sorry, there was a fart trapped in the play.

239
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,180
嘿 Jasper 你好吗
Hey, Jasper, how are you?

240
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,180
嘿 Brian
Hey, Brian!

241
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,050
祝贺你的新剧大获成功
Congratulations on your new play.

242
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,280
哦 谢谢
Oh, thanks.

243
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,820
怎么了 你看起来状态不佳
What's wrong? You look awful.

244
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,980
发生什么了
What happened?

245
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,450
我读了Stewie写的剧本
I read the play Stewie wrote.

246
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,020
她现在写剧本
She writes plays now?

247
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,760
是的 而且那个剧本写得特别好
Yes, and it was brilliant.

248
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,360
Jasper 我这辈子都不可能再读到那样好的作品了
Jasper, I've never read anything like it in my life.

249
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,910
那个故事富有见解 新颖 而且很有灵气
It was insightful and fresh and intelligent.

250
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,850
就像他的剧本在嘲笑我
It's like his play is mocking me.

251
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,410
他一晚上写好的
He wrote it in a night.

252
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,570
呃 正如我在Bravo上看到Brad Goreski的感受一样
Ugh, that's how I feel whenever I see Brad Goreski on Bravo.

253
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,450
明星造型师 他在Bravo台推出了时尚节目"It's a Brad, Brad World"

254
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,540
天啊 除了我每个人都在Bravo上
God, everyone's on Bravo but me.

255
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,110
不过 你告诉他这剧本怎么样了么
Anyhoo, have you told him how good it is?

256
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,340
还没 我才刚读完
No. I just read it.

257
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,020
他给我剧本就是想要我的评价
He gave it to me 'cause he wanted my feedback.

258
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,190
好的 听我说
Okay, listen to me.

259
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,330
告诉Stewie剧本糟透了 是个垃圾
Tell Stewie it's awful, it's garbage.

260
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,830
要不择手段 Brian
Do whatever you have to do, Brian,

261
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,600
让他永远都不知道自己有天赋
but never let him know he's got talent.

262
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,700
没错 你说的对
Yeah, you're right.

263
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,230
这不会很难
It won't be so hard.

264
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,170
毕竟 我做过更过分的
After all, I've certainly done worse.

265
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,300
我把Peter的那罐"我不敢相信这竟然不是黄油"
I replaced Peter's I Can't Believe It's Not Butter

266
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,300
联合利华生产的一个牌子的人造黄油食品

267
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,770
换成了真的黄油
with real butter.

268
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,110
我...我不敢...我不敢相信...
I... I can't... I can't believe...

269
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,720
我不明白 医生
I don't know, Doctor.

270
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,050
回想一下 我觉得可能那是真的黄油
Looking back, I think it may have been real butter.

271
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,470
你丈夫谋杀了三个孩子
Your husband murdered three children.

272
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,830
哦 天啊 看看这个
Oh, my God. Look at this.

273
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,400
Brian 过来看看
Brian, get in here.

274
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,430
怎么了
What?

275
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,120
你的剧被提名为
Your play has been nominated

276
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,820
本地最具创造力事物的超级巨奖
for a local Hoggy Award for Best Creative Anything.

277
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,240
哦 太棒了
Oh, that's great.

278
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,670
呃 我要...
Um, I'm gonna...

279
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,990
我去呼吸点新鲜空气
I'm going to go get some air.

280
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,650
看看

你们两个今天做了什么
What have you two done today?

283
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,970
我在我的一个睾丸下面发现了一个肿块
I found a lump under one of my balls.

284
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,500
好吧 这的确是个发现
Okay, that's something.

285
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,600
我吃了四分之三的 Entenmann牌的点心
I ate three quarters of an Entenmann's strudel.

286

287
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,140
你们都是好孩子
Youse are good kids.

288
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,730
你有没有抽空读我的剧本呢

290

哦 我好紧张
Ooh, I'm so nervous.

292
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,800
你觉得怎样
What'd you think?

293
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,320
Stewie 我们是朋友 对吧
Stewie, you and I are friends, right?

294
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,300
嗯 我是说 我认识你

295

是通过我们共同的朋友Greg
through our mutual friend Greg,

296
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,240

but sure, I'd say we're friends now.

297
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,530
是啊 既然-既然是你的朋友
Exactly. And-and as your friend,

298
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,390
你希望我诚实地回答你 是吧
you'd want me to be honest with you, right?

299
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,430
当然
Totally.

300
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,630
剧本不咋样
It wasn't good.

301
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,960
哦 不 真的
Oh, no, really?

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,270
我写得如此用心
Oh, I worked so hard on it.

303
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,340
哦 我认为这个不错来着 唉
Oh, I thought it was good. Aw.

304
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,490
哦 我懂 我也衷心希望剧本不错来着
Oh, I know, I wanted it to be good so much.

305
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,320
哦 我太郁闷了
Oh, I am so bummed out right now.

306
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,530
我-我...我都不知道我是不是应该交稿了
I-I... Now I don't even know if I should submit it.

307
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,200
什么...交稿?
Wha... Submit it?

308
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,510
是的 我准备把它投递给

别！我是说...
No! I mean...

312
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,920
哦 我是说 这-这是一个不好的点子
Oh, I mean, that-that would be a bad idea.

313
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,320
绝对不好
Definitely not.

314
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,620
别 别 他们不会像我对你这么客气的
No, no, they won't let you down easy like I did.

315
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,320
纽约是非常严苛的 尤其对于外地人
New York can be pretty harsh, especially to outsiders.

316
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,290
嗨 纽约！
Hello, New York!

317
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,380
呃 也许你是对的 我会考虑的
Ugh, maybe you're right. I'll think about it.

318
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,000
不过 我能拿回来我的剧本吗?这是我唯一的一份
Anyway, can I have that back? It's my only copy.

319
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,230
你只有一份?
Your only copy?

320
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,320
是的
Yes.

321

还有谢谢你是这么好的一个朋友
And thank you for being a good friend

322
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,940
并且告诉我真相 Brian
and telling me the truth, Brian.

323
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,370
我知道这对你来说很难
I know that was hard for you.

324
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,670
为了表达我对你阅稿的感激之情
And to show my appreciation for reading my play,

325
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,510
我为你做了这个
I made you this.

326
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,880
官方认证 好狗

327
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,080
哇哦 "好狗"
Wow, "good dog."

328
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,580
并且是官方认证的?
And it's official?

329
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,000
就写在那 不是吗
That's what it says, doesn't it?

330
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,350
真希望我爸能活着看到这一幕
I wish my dad was alive to see this.

331
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,270
嘿
Hey.

332
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,450
你他娘是谁啊
Who the hell are you?

333
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,420
我是Stewie花钱雇来看着他睡觉的
I'm the guy Stewie pays to watch him sleep.

334
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,490
你又是谁
Who are you?

335
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,090
我是Brian 我住这
I'm Brian. I live here.

336
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,390
哦
Oh.

337
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,060
你介意我取走这个剧本吗
Do you mind if I take this script?

338
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,330
不介意 当然 随便
Yeah, sure, whatever.

339
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,850
他只让我看他睡觉
He just pays me to watch him sleep

340
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,280
并且同时用刀摩擦我的脸
and rub this knife across my face while I do it.

341
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,980
哦
Oh.

342
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,740
好吧
Okay.

343
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,240
嘿 stewie他付你多少钱
Hey, how much does Stewie pay you?

344
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,910
$4,800一周
$4,800 a week.

345
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,040
靠！
(bleep)

346
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,260
没错
Yeah.

347
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,150
嘿 Brian
Hey, Brian.

348
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,220
哦 嘿 Stewie
Oh, hey, Stewie.

349
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,580
听着 你看见我的剧本了么
Listen, have you seen my play?

350
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,420
哦 Stewie 我的确看了你的剧本
You know, Stewie, I have seen your play,

351
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,890
并且它让我愉悦
and it is exhilarating to me.

352
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,860
一个儿童的剧本是这个世界上
A child's play is one of

353
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,580
最美丽的东西之一
the most beautiful things in the world.

354
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,540
继续 小家伙
Continue to play, little one.

355
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,150
你是我们的未来
You're our future.

356
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,950
你他娘的在说什么
What the (bleep) are you talking about?

357
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,580
我写的剧本 你看见没
The play I wrote. Have you seen it?

358
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,470
呃 我不知道 我问问我的律师
Uh, I don't know. Let me call my lawyer.

359
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,020
嗨 我正在被盘问
(chuckles) Hello. I'm being cross-examined.

360
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,150
不 我没有...我没有看见你的剧本
No, I haven't... I haven't seen it.

361
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,230
真的?因为我就把它放在我的桌子上...
Really? 'Cause I had it sitting right on my table...

362
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,890
我说了我没有看见 行了吧！
I said I haven't seen it, all right!

363
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,640
而且 又怎么样呢?反正写的糟透了
And what does it matter? It was terrible anyway!

364
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,740
我们已经讨论过了
We've had this conversation!

365
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,280
你自己行行好 换个兴趣吧
Do yourself a favor and move on!

366
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,150
很有趣 Brian 因为我发现了这个
Well, that's interesting, Brian, because I found this

367
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,870
就埋在后院里你藏的骨头旁边
buried in the backyard next to your soup bone.

368
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,040
Stewie 我...
Stewie, I...

369
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,670
你想要摧毁它 不是吗
You tried to destroy it, didn't you?

370
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,110
我就知道我的剧本很好
I knew my play was good.

371
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,410
正如我知道你的剧本只是一个平庸的拼凑物
Just like I knew your play was a mediocre patchwork

372
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,740
充满老旧的观点和乏味的陈腔滥调
of hackneyed ideas and tired clichés.

373
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,880
你根本不知道有多难
You have no idea how hard it was

374
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,350
和那些粗里粗气的土鳖们一起坐在剧院里
to sit in that theater with all those braying hyenas.

375
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,350
难不成你能举出例证说明
Couldn't you tell something was up

376
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,620
Chris和那个死胖子跟得上剧情?
when Chris and the fat man could follow the plot?

377
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,860
我是说 Peter花了一年才明白精灵鼠小弟
I mean, it took Peter a year to figure out Stuart Little.

378
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,220
我突然明白了
I just figured it out.

379
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,430
"精灵"是指"老鼠"的意思
"Stuart" means "mouse."

380
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,530
不是的 Peter
No, Peter.

381
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,400
"小"指"老鼠"？
"Little" means "mouse"?

382
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,600
不是 Peter
No, Peter.

383
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,930
我感觉自己又落伍又迟钝
I feel so old and in the way.

384
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,290
那它还是一部不错的剧
It's still a good play!

385
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,890
它充斥着糟糕的下流双关语
It's filled with terrible double entendres,

386
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,560
俏皮话和偷来的点子
puns and stolen bits.

387
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,190
有一行都出自《宋飞传》
There's a line in there from Seinfeld!

388
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,190
NBC播出的著名情景喜剧(1989-1998)

389
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,830
我从没看过那个电视剧
I never saw that episode!

390
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,930
我有自己的心声
I have a voice.

391
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,990
你明白吗
Do you understand that?

392
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,800
一个作家需要心声 我就有
A writer needs a voice, and I have one.

393
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,230
你没有
You don't.

394
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,750
你的剧只迎合最低级趣味的共鸣 Brian
Your play panders to the lowest common denominator, Brian.

395
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,790
并且做的也并不够好
And it doesn't even do that well.

396
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,520
闭嘴!
Shut up!

397
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,890
愿每一个
May every person

398
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,760
嘲笑你菜鸟级"力作"的人
that laughs at your sophomoric effort

399
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,920
都提醒你记着自己永远的平庸
be a reminder of your eternal mediocrity

400
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,040
像尖刀一样刺穿你的心脏
and pierce your heart like a knife.

401
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,290
过来 混蛋
Come here, you bastard!

402
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,180
你让人讨厌
You stink!

403
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,510
你的剧本也让人讨厌
And your play stinks!

404
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,510
这跟我没关吧
This ain't about me, is it?

405
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,120
不
No.

406
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,350
我很抱歉...
And I'm sorry...

407
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,290
但是不能有人知道这个
but nobody can ever know that.

408
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,510
Donna 是Grant 你的新婚丈夫
Donna? It's Grant, your new husband!

409
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,550
嗨 亲爱的
Hi, honey.

410
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,930
我有几个好消息
I've got great news.

411
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,970
是什么
What is it?

412
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,870
首先 我们把那瓶苏格兰威士忌佳酿放哪了
First, where do we keep the good scotch?

413
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,400
在你兄弟家里
At your brother's house.

414
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,110
Lois 我能在这开我的生日聚会吗
PETER: Lois, can I have my birthday here?

415
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,890
看起来进行得不错
Seems to be going well.

416
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,080
你究竟想要什么
What do you want?

417
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,730
想分享一个好消息不
Wanted to share a bit of good news.

418
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,500
我刚才得知我的剧
I just found out that my play

419
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,500
将要在百老汇演出了
