12
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,854
Wow, I'm so excited
for Brian.

13
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:40,523
Remember, kids--
if it's terrible,

14
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:43,142
at the end, we all say,
"You did it!"

15
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,644
I can't believe we're
going to the theater

16
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,046
the same day Chris
drowned a mouse in a puddle.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,615
I mean, don't we need a day
to clear our heads?

18
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,800
Boy, this takes me back.

19
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,001
You know, I was, uh...

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,869
kind of one of those theater
kids in high school.

27

Mrs. Andrews, I pooped
in the pot again.

28
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,005
I'm gonna need somebody
to clean me up.

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,206
(crying)

30
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,542
It's really bad this time.

31
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,010
Wow, what a turnout.

32
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,295
Oh, hey, there's Glenn.

33
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,312
Hey, guys.

34
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,681
Hey, this is my date,
Consuela.

35
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,699
No, no, no.

36
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:25,284
Okay, we're here
as friends,

37
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,486
but I'm gonna change
your mind one day.

38
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,690
(indistinct conversations)

39
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,324
Oh, I'm so proud of Brian.

40
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,043
It's hard to believe
he's the same dog

41
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:36,429
who barked at a pineapple
for four hours.

42
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,664
Close your purse.
I can see your tampons.

43
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,166
And why do you need six?

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,168
What happens to you?

45
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,519
There's the man
of the hour.

46
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:44,670
Hey, Brian, can you believe

47
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,739
I found this blazer
on the side of the highway?

48
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,240
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming.

49
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,509
Big night, Brian.
How you feeling?

50
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:51,510
Well, a little nervous.

51
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,695
I just want it to go well.

52
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,746
Fingers crossed.

53
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,047
Will there be
an intermission?

54
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,682
Because that will determine
whether or not

55
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,118
I bring this empty Gatorade
bottle into the theater.

56
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,519
TOM: This is
unacceptable!

57
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,071
Sorry, guys,
I got to go.

58
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,340
They didn't put masking tape
over a seat for Tom Tucker

59
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,025
and he's in there
pitching a fit.

60
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,099
TOM: Do you
know who I am?!

61
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,427
I'm Tom Tucker,
damn it!

62
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,664
I make more in an hour
than you make in two hours!

63
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,016
Oh, the play's about to start.

64
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,702
Mom, am I going to fit
in the seat

65
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,888
or is this going to be
like last time?

66
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,857
This should tide you
over for a while.

67
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,360
I'll come back
as soon as I can.

68
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,130
She's not coming
back, you know.

69
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:29,365
How do you know that?

70
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,434
'Cause she's
my mom, too.

71
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,856
Excuse me, that's my seat.

72
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,309
We'll talk
about this at home.

73
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:42,378
(sighs):
Let's see.

74
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,379
Who's in this thing?

75
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,413
Sad. Nobody.

76
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:46,215
Sad. Sad. Nobody.

77
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,316
Victor Garber?

78
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,417
That's pretty good.

79
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:49,752
How did he get Victor...?

80
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:50,920
Oh, of course.

81
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:52,872
Tonight it's Randall Evan
Battincourt.

82
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,340
God, I hate understudies.

83
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,574
King Louis the Sixteenth

84
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,310
has been sentenced to death
by guillotine.

85
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,795
(cheering)

86
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,497
The part of King Louis
the Sixteenth

87
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:04,133
will be played
by Jean de Menard.

88
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,601
(crowd groans)

89
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,269
Relax, you're
going to do great.

90
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:08,437
(sighs)

91
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,791
Nailed it.

92
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,029
Well, as usual,

93
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,198
this is gonna suck
for one of us.

94
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:23,219
Donna? It's Grant,
your new husband.

95
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:24,353
Hi, honey.

96
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:25,788
I've got great news.

97
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:26,939
What is it?

98
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,841
First, where do we keep
the good scotch?

99
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,509
At your brother's house.

100
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,745
(audience laughing,
Peter laughing hard)

101
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,614
I got an audition for the
hottest new play in town.

102
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,483
This could really
make my career

103
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,451
and we can finally
start our family.

104
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,586
What's it called?

105
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,921
<i>A Passing Fancy.</i>

106
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,055
(audience gasps softly)

107
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,024
(gasps)
That's the name of this play.

108
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,493
How did he do that?
How did he do that?!

109
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,162
Here, Donna.

110
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,164
I got you your ten-year
anniversary present.

111
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,532
Suntan lotion?

112
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,000
But we live
in the Northeast.

113
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,702
That's right, we do.

114
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,772
Unless we were moving
to California.

115
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,674
(gasps)
He must've got the part.

116
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,542
When he going
to meet Evita?

117
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,578
Not every play is <i>Evita.</i>

118
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,646
Oh, no.
I feel terrible.

119
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,348
Why?
Don't you want to go?

120
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,401
No-- I got you
a parka.

121
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:13,752
(laughing)

122
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,022
Those two are never
on the same page.

123
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,092
Wait for the look...

124
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,394
(audience laughing)

125
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,697
And that's why it works.

126
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,800
(crying)

127
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,435
Donna, don't go!

128
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,271
It's not too late.
We can still start our family.

129
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,305
Don't you see?

130
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,040
You already have
a family.

131
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,575
It's right there.

132
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,711
(audience "oohs")

133
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,880
Those won't keep you
warm at night.

134
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,514
Good-bye, Grant.

135
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,883
It's funny, isn't it?

136
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:47,786
All these years, I was
the passing fancy.

137
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,958
(cheering)

138
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,716
Get up, you jerk.

139
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,751
(cheering)

140
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,730
(cheering continues)

141
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,434
Wow, that was amazing!

142
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,552
I mean, usually,
the shows suck in this town.

143
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,238
Like Moishe, the low-energy
Bar Mitzvah clown.

144
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,424
Ooh, what's this?

145
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,492
A quarter.

146
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,627
I found it behind
your ear earlier.

147
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,629
All right, that's enough
tricks for you.

148
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,165
I'm going to go lie
down on the coats.

149
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,155
Hey, has anybody seen
the review yet?

150
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,307
No, we've been waiting for you.

151
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,291
Thanks.

152
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:44,026
Oh, here it is.

153
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,896
"Here's hoping <i>A Passing Fancy</i>
is actually a staying fancy.

154
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,866
"The highest praise goes
to playwright Brian Griffin

155
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,801
"for his hilarious
and insightful look

00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,236
"into modern relationships.

157
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,639
"If you see only one play
as an adult,

158
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,340
I urge you to see this one."

159
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,642
Hey, can you read
that page

160
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,560
with all the little paragraphs
about dead people?

161
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,928
Those are hilarious.

162
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,880
This is amazing, Brian.
How do you feel?

163
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,448
You're a hit!

164
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:07,750
It's... overwhelming.

165
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,885
This is all I've ever wanted,
you know?

166
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,705
For people to appreciate
and respect my writing.

167
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,306
I want to write
a play!

168
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,574
(chuckles)
Aw, that's cute, Stewie.

169
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,775
Maybe someday.

170
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,876
No, I'm going
to write a play.

171
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,244
I can do lots
of things.

172
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,647
I was the human resources
director for the Muppets.

173
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,749
Mr. Beaker, it is my
unfortunate task

174
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,284
to inform you
that your services

175
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,419
will no longer be required
by this company.

176
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,188
(unintelligible squeak)

177
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,556
Well, if you must know,

178
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,224
it's because we've
noticed large quantities

179
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,792
of benzene, ephedrine

180
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,861
and everyday Epsom salt
have gone missing.

181
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,162
(unintelligible squeak)

182
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,197
Oh, please.

183
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,398
We both know those
are the ingredients

184
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,899
used to make
crystal meth.

185
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,301
And I've got
a pretty good idea

186
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,969
who you've been
selling it to as well.

187
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,237
Oh, hey, uh, Beaker,

188
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,638
when you're done
talking to your friend,

189
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,806
I want to, uh, eh...

190
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,541
I want to talk to you
about that thing.

191
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,796
Hey, what you doing?

192
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,597
I was going to start
rehearsing my new play.

193
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:56,799
Want to hear it?

194
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,717
Oh, you actually wrote
a little play.

195
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,719
Aw, boy, I wish
I could hang out,

196
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,905
but it has just
gotten so crazy.

197
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,556
Really?
I know, right?

198
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,291
I mean, I'm not
complaining, you know?

199
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,360
But I just... I want
my old life back.

200
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,611
(jokingly growls)

201
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:10,679
I'm just kidding,
of course.

202
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:12,414
I'm so grateful,
you know?

203
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,299
I mean, every
performance is sold out

204
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:15,768
and they just added
a Wednesday matinee.

205
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,186
It's great.

206
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,554
I mean, there's only
one thing I'm not getting

207
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:19,555
out of this experience.

208
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:20,756
What's that?
Sleep.

209
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,824
(jokingly growls)

210
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,275
No, no, I'm so
grateful, really.

211
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,177
It's just that I'm-I'm
so busy all the time.

212
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,445
But it's great.
It's all great.

213
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,280
Well, do you think you might
have time to read it?

214
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,481
(sighs)
All right, all right.

215
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,766
But be patient,
all right?

216
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,401
I've got interviews and
appearances all week.

217
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:33,635
I mean, they're squeezing

218
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,031
every last drop they
can out of me,

219
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,572
like a bottle of ketchup.

220
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,992
Listen, we've been at this
for 15 minutes.

221
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,610
I don't think anything's
coming out.

222
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:43,245
I'm fine.
I can keep going.

223
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,696
I'm just really tired.

224
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,531
What if I stick my finger
in your hole?

225
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,867
Eh, that only works
when I'm already close.

226
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:54,556
The American play was dying.

227
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:57,025
Have-have we brought it
back to life here?

228
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,595
I can't say that,
but it has a pulse.

229
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:01,697
You're such an amazing
writer, Brian.

230
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,832
How do you do it?
What's your process?

231
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,685
Oh, God, Allison,
how do I even answer that?

232
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,488
Uh, I mean, what's
a rainbow's process?

233
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:13,525
Two parts rain, one part sun,
one part childlike wonder.

234
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,993
What we do know, though,

235
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,330
is that the end result
in both cases is joy.

236
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,350
Wow.

237
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,318
Wow, are you glad you left
the lighthouse now, Seamus?

238
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:24,820
Oh, I think so, Seamus!

239
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,872
Excuse me, I noticed
you were talking loud,

240
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,474
so that means you're smart.

241
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,409
But would you mind--
and I hate asking--

242
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,044
but would you mind
signing this?

243
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,812
Is this guy giving you
a hard time, Brian?

244
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,847
Nah, he's all right.

245
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,948
All right. Cool, cool.

246
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,249
How you doing, buddy?

247
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,317
(Mozart's 29th Symphony
in A Major plays)

248
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,155
(music builds)

249
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,371
(music ends)

250
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,939
My God.

251
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,742
It's miraculous.

252
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,244
(bleep)

253
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,963
Hey, Brian, can you
read my play?

254
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,164
(fart noise)

255
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,316
Sorry, there was a fart
trapped in the play.

256
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:52,182
Hey, Jasper, how are you?

257
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,183
Hey, Brian!

258
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,051
Congratulations
on your new play.

259
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:56,286
Oh, thanks.

260
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,821
What's wrong?
You look awful.

261
00:09:57,855 --> 00:09:58,989
What happened?

262
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:00,457
I read the play Stewie wrote.

263
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:02,025
She writes plays now?

264
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,760
Yes, and it was brilliant.

265
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:06,363
Jasper, I've never read anything
like it in my life.

266
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,915
It was insightful and fresh
and intelligent.

267
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:10,850
It's like his play
is mocking me.

268
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,419
He wrote it in a night.

269
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:15,572
Ugh, that's how I feel whenever
I see Brad Goreski on Bravo.

270
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:17,540
God, everyone's on Bravo but me.

271
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,110
Anyhoo, have you told him
how good it is?

272
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:21,344
No. I just read it.

273
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:23,029
He gave it to me
'cause he wanted my feedback.

274
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:24,197
Okay, listen to me.

275
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:26,332
Tell Stewie it's awful,
it's garbage.

276
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:27,834
Do whatever
you have to do, Brian,

277
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:29,602
but never let him know
he's got talent.

278
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:30,704
Yeah, you're right.

279
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:32,238
It won't be so hard.

280
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:34,174
After all, I've
certainly done worse.

281
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,309
I replaced Peter's
I Can't Believe It's Not Butter

282
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,777
with real butter.

283
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:43,349
Buh... wuh... suh... muh-wuh...

284
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:46,119
I... I can't...
I can't believe...

285
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:47,954
Muh... wuh...

286
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:49,255
(screaming)

287
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:50,724
I don't know, Doctor.

288
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:53,059
Looking back, I think it
may have been real butter.

289
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:55,478
Your husband murdered
three children.

290
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,834
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

291
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,402
Brian, get in here.

292
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:03,436
What?

293
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:05,121
Your play has
been nominated

294
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:08,825
for a local Hoggy Award
for Best Creative Anything.

295
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:10,243
Oh, that's great.

296
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:12,679
Um, I'm gonna...

297
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,998
I'm going to go get some air.

298
00:11:16,617 --> 00:11:17,650
Look at that.

299
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,052
Nominated
for an award.

300
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:20,637
What have you
two done today?

301
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,972
I found a lump
under one of my balls.

302
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,507
Okay, that's
something.

303
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,609
I ate three quarters
of an Entenmann's strudel.

304
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,145
Youse are good kids.

305
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,735
Hey, so did you get
a chance to read my play?

306
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,270
Uh... I did.

307
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:38,404
I did.

308
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:39,506
Ooh, I'm so nervous.

309
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,807
What'd you think?

310
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:42,325
Stewie, you and I
are friends, right?

311
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,309
Yeah, I mean,
I know you

312
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:44,477
through our mutual
friend Greg,

313
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:46,246
but sure, I'd say
we're friends now.

314
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,530
Exactly. And-and
as your friend,

315
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:49,399
you'd want me to be
honest with you, right?

316
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:50,433
Totally.

317
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:51,634
It wasn't good.

318
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,969
Oh, no, really?

319
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,271
Oh, I worked
so hard on it.

320
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:58,341
Oh, I thought it
was good. Aw.

321
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,494
Oh, I know, I wanted it
to be good so much.

322
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:03,329
Oh, I am so bummed out
right now.

323
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:05,532
I-I... Now I don't even know
if I should submit it.

324
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,200
Wha... Submit it?

325
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,518
Yeah, I was planning
to submit it

326
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:10,019
to the Roundabout Theater
Company in New York.

327
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:11,254
No! I mean...

328
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:12,928
Oh, I mean, that-that
would be a bad idea.

329
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,324
Definitely not.

330
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,626
No, no, they won't let
you down easy like I did.

331
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,329
New York can be pretty harsh,
especially to outsiders.

332
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,297
Hello, New York!

333
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,216
(dragon screeching)

334
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,385
Ugh, maybe you're right.
I'll think about it.

335
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:28,004
Anyway, can I have that back?
It's my only copy.

336
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,239
Your only copy?

337
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:30,323
Yes.

338
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:31,641
And thank you
for being a good friend

339
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:32,942
and telling me
the truth, Brian.

340
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,377
I know that was
hard for you.

341
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:36,679
And to show my appreciation
for reading my play,

342
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,515
I made you this.

343
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,084
Wow, "good dog."

344
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:42,585
And it's official?

345
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,003
That's what it says,
doesn't it?

346
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:46,356
I wish my dad was
alive to see this.

347
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:03,273
Hey.

348
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:04,457
Who the hell
are you?

349
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:06,426
I'm the guy Stewie pays
to watch him sleep.

350
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,493
Who are you?

351
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:09,095
I'm Brian.
I live here.

352
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,396
Oh.

353
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,065
Do you mind if
I take this script?

354
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:13,333
Yeah, sure, whatever.

355
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:14,851
He just pays me
to watch him sleep

356
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:17,287
and rub this knife
across my face while I do it.

357
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:18,988
Oh.

358
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:20,740
Okay.

359
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,244
Hey, how much
does Stewie pay you?

360
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:25,912
$4,800 a week.

361
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:27,046
(bleep)

362
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:28,264
Yeah.

363
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:33,152
Hey, Brian.

364
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,220
Oh, hey, Stewie.

365
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:35,588
Listen, have you
seen my play?

366
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:37,423
You know, Stewie,
I have seen your play,

367
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,893
and it is
exhilarating to me.

368
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:41,861
A child's play is one of

369
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:43,580
the most beautiful
things in the world.

370
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,548
Continue to play,
little one.

371
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,150
You're our future.

372
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:48,952
What the (bleep) are
you talking about?

373
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:50,587
The play I wrote.
Have you seen it?

374
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,472
Uh, I don't know.
Let me call my lawyer.

375
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:54,023
(chuckles) Hello. I'm being
cross-examined.

376
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:56,159
No, I haven't...
I haven't seen it.

377
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:58,233
Really? 'Cause I had it
sitting right on my table...

378
00:13:58,262 --> 00:13:59,895
I said I haven't
seen it, all right!

379
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,648
And what does it matter?
It was terrible anyway!

380
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:02,749
We've had this conversation!

381
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:04,284
Do yourself a favor
and move on!

382
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:06,152
Well, that's interesting, Brian,
because I found this

383
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:08,871
buried in the backyard
next to your soup bone.

384
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:09,973
(gasps)

385
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:11,040
Stewie, I...

386
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:12,675
You tried to destroy it,
didn't you?

387
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,110
I knew my play was good.

388
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,412
Just like I knew your play
was a mediocre patchwork

389
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:18,748
of hackneyed ideas
and tired clichés.

390
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:20,883
You have no idea how hard it was

391
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:23,353
to sit in that theater
with all those braying hyenas.

392
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:25,355
Couldn't you tell
something was up

393
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:27,624
when Chris and the fat man
could follow the plot?

394
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,860
I mean, it took Peter a year
to figure out <i>Stuart Little.</i>

395
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:33,229
I just figured it out.

396
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,430
"Stuart" means "mouse."

397
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:36,532
No, Peter.

398
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,401
"Little" means "mouse"?

399
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:39,602
No, Peter.

400
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:42,939
I feel so old
and in the way.

401
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:44,290
It's still a good play!

402
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,892
It's filled with terrible
double entendres,

403
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,560
puns and stolen bits.

404
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:49,195
There's a line in there
from <i>Seinfeld!</i>

405
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:50,830
I never saw that episode!

406
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:51,931
I have a voice.

407
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:52,999
Do you understand that?

408
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,801
A writer needs a voice,
and I have one.

409
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:56,235
You don't.

410
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,755
Your play panders to the lowest
common denominator, Brian.

411
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:00,790
And it doesn't even
do that well.

412
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:01,524
Shut up!

413
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,892
May every person

414
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:04,761
that laughs at your
sophomoric effort

415
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:06,929
be a reminder
of your eternal mediocrity

416
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:10,049
and pierce your heart
like a knife.

417
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,724
(squirrel chittering)

418
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:20,293
Come here, you bastard!

419
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:23,129
(barking)

420
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:24,180
You stink!

421
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,515
And your play stinks!

422
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,517
This ain't about me, is it?

423
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,887
(sobbing)

424
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:33,122
No.

425
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,358
And I'm sorry...

426
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,294
but nobody can ever know that.

427
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:40,246
(bone cracking)

428
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:45,518
Donna? It's Grant,
your new husband!

429
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:46,552
Hi, honey.

430
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:47,937
I've got
great news.

431
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:48,971
What is it?

432
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:50,873
First, where do we keep
the good scotch?

433
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,408
At your
brother's house.

434
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:55,044
(audience laughing,
Peter laughing hard)

435
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,113
PETER: Lois, can I have
my birthday here?

436
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:58,898
Seems to be going well.

437
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:00,083
What do you want?

438
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:01,734
Wanted to share
a bit of good news.

439
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,503
I just found out
that my play

440
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:05,505
is going to be
produced on Broadway.

441
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:06,906
What?

442
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,876
And I'm taking Randall
Evan Battincourt with me.

443
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,277
Hi, Stewie.
I'll be right there.

444
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:13,079
I just got to
finish this crap.

445
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:21,088
Hey, I need you
to take me to New York

446
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:22,773
for the opening night
of my play.

447
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:23,858
(scoffs)
No way.

448
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:25,576
Besides, I checked,
and there's no play

449
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,444
by Stewie Griffin
opening in New York.

450
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,759
I submitted it
under a pseudonym.

451
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,015
They think it was written
by Tony Dovolani.

452
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:33,617
I thought your pseudonym
was Gorgeous Randy Flamethrower.

453
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:35,653
That's my dodge ball
pseudonym.

454
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:37,021
Look, if you won't take me,

455
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:39,175
I'm sure the New York Theater
League would send a car.

456
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:40,858
New York Theater League? Why?

457
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:43,060
Because they're throwing
a welcome dinner in my honor.

458
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:44,161
Really?

459
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:46,130
Well, I guess I could
clear my schedule.

460
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:47,698
Oh, you won't
regret it, Brian.

461
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:50,768
All the most important
Broadway people will be there.

462
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,637
Playwrights, money men,
even Stanley Kowalski.

463
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:54,805
Hi. I'm Michael.

464
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,224
Michael!

465
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,476
Michael!

466
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:01,512
Um, and this is my wife, Nancy.

467
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,630
Nancy!

468
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,500
Nancy!

469
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:09,937
And this is our Uzbekistani
friend, Bokyavroychesku.

470
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:11,105
Hi.

471
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,380
Stewie, don't you think you're
overdoing it with that outfit.

472
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,855
I don't wear anything I can't
take off with a flourish.

473
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:27,943
Wow, this is amazing.

474
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:29,745
Every major
playwright is here.

475
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,881
Yes, and it seems to be
quite a successful party.

476
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:34,183
Several of them have
already committed suicide.

477
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:35,284
Great party.

478
00:17:35,302 --> 00:17:36,635
Totally!

479
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:38,721
MAN:
Hey, Tony.

480
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:40,423
Oh, my God,
that's David Mamet.

481
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:41,657
There's the man
of the evening.

482
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:44,393
I read your play,
<i>An American Marriage.</i>

483
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:47,379
It was incredibly raw.
I was pretty damn impressed.

484
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:48,447
Oh, thank you, David.

485
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:50,533
David, this is Brian.
Brian, David.

486
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,517
Oh, it's an honor.

487
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:52,818
Listen, I just
want to say

488
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:54,653
what an inspiration
<i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i> was to me

489
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:56,122
when I was writing
my own play.

490
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:57,373
Easy.

491
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:58,741
Is that
Tony Dovolani?

492
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,276
Hello. Alan Bennett.

493
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,811
Fantastic play.

494
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:03,479
And I'm
Yasmina Reza.

495
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:05,181
Oh, are you his night nurse?

496
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:06,715
No, I'm
a playwright.

497
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,384
I wrote <i>Art</i> and
<i>God of Carnage.</i>

498
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:09,752
I won
a Pulitzer.

499
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:12,188
You want to say your
grade point average, too?

500
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:14,290
Boy, it's just
so weird to be in a room

501
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,492
where every single person
in the room is a playwright.

502
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:17,993
Every single
one of us.

503
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:19,128
Everyone.

504
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:20,613
Including me.

505
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:22,214
I'm a playwright.

506
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:24,083
Brian, my God,
take it down a notch.

507
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:25,785
You're a playwright?
In New York?

508
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,453
Well, Quahog,
Rhode Island.

509
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:28,971
You're kidding.

510
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:30,706
We just went and saw a play
in Quahog, Rhode Island.

511
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,907
Really?

512
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,343
Have you ever heard
of <i>A Passing Fancy?</i>

513
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:35,394
I have!

514
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,880
Oh, my God,
what a load of rubbish.

515
00:18:37,914 --> 00:18:38,914
(chuckles)

516
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:40,249
We have this thing
where we go

517
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:41,750
to the worst regional theater
we can find

518
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:43,652
and laugh ourselves sick.

519
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:46,188
And this one took
the grand prize.

520
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:48,207
(laughing)

521
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:49,325
Really?

522
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,827
I-I had heard
only good things.

523
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:55,197
It was a (bleep) piece
of (bleep) on a (bleep)!

524
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:56,465
(laughing)

525
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,550
Oh, my God.

526
00:18:57,584 --> 00:19:00,436
I got to hear David Mamet
curse in person.

527
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,231
Oh, there you are.

528
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:14,867
That was the worst
night of my life.

529
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:17,102
It's not like you were
the only fat guy in there.

530
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:18,153
What?

531
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:20,055
Oh, this is about
the play. Sorry.

532
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,592
I was so happy until
I read your play, Stewie.

533
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:26,795
I finally had some kind
of success as a writer.

534
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,631
It wasn't big,
but it was mine.

535
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,933
I was fine being an okay writer,

536
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:34,036
until I discovered I was living
in a house with a brilliant one.

537
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,405
I know we don't talk
about doggy years a lot,

538
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,741
but I-I just wish
you could have waited

539
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:42,177
to find out how talented
you were until I was gone.

540
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:44,480
By the time I'm dead,
you won't even be ten.

541
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:46,615
You'll have 70 more years
to be great.

542
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,753
I just wish I could have
had five to be good.

543
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,588
There's your voice, Brian.

544
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:54,957
It's a depressing voice,
but it's yours.

545
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:56,358
Write from that.

546
00:19:56,393 --> 00:19:58,260
Listen, me and
the other playwrights

547
00:19:58,295 --> 00:19:59,495
are going out
to have drinks

548
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:01,146
with Woody Allen
and his daughter-wife.

549
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:02,331
You want to come?

550
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:03,532
All right.

551
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,502
We can just sit here
for a while.

552
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:12,341
They talked a lot more crap
about you after you left.

553
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,500
Oh, God, that was just terrible.
Terrible.

554
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:23,235
I don't understand.

555
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,337
Stewie, what happened
to the play you wrote?

556
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:26,705
That was terrible.

557
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,980
Well, I gave it
a final polish..

558
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:29,208
Changed a few things.

559
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:31,143
Guess I kind of mucked
the whole thing up.

560
00:20:31,177 --> 00:20:33,279
But how? You...

561
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:34,280
Wait

562
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:36,849
Did you do that... for me?

563
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,584
What are you talking about?
I'm a young writer.

564
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:40,452
I just wasn't as ready
as I thought I was.

565
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,955
Maybe in a couple of years,
who knows?

566
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,090
Stewie, you shouldn't
have done that.

567
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,760
But... thanks.

568
00:20:47,794 --> 00:20:49,528
No problem, Brian.

569
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,036
Hey, what do you say
we head back home?

570
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:51,997
That sounds good.

571
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:55,115
You know, I'm going to move to
New York City when I'm older,

572
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:56,583
'cause it's
twinkly and big

573
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:58,034
and this is where
dreams come true,

574
00:20:58,085 --> 00:21:00,036
and that giant bird's
coming for us, isn't he?

575
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:02,122
