12
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:38,091
Hey, Chris, what
do you got there?

13
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,326
I made a birdhouse
at school today.

14
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,744
Oh, looks an
awful lot like

15
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:43,446
the Governor's
Mansion from <i>Benson.</i>

16
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:45,148
It is.
I'm fond of the series,

17
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:47,383
and I wanted the local birds
to be aware of that.

18
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:48,985
Well, I'll be on the lookout
for great tits.

19
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:50,253
Peter!

20
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:51,838
Well, actually, Lois,
that's a species of bird

21
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:54,107
that's known to frequent
domestic birdhouses.

22
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:55,825
It's why I've always
wanted a birdhouse.

23
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,900
Hey, Lois,
let's go outside

24
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:58,478
and see if we can
find some great tits.

25
00:00:58,512 --> 00:01:00,146
'Cause there certainly
ain't any in here!

26
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:02,348
Remember those two
we saw last night?

27
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:04,050
One was bigger
than the other.

28
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:05,668
Yeah, and-and the bigger one
had a hair

29
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:07,103
sticking out
of that pointy thing.

30
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:08,938
What do you call
that pointy thing, again?

31
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:09,973
The beak?
Okay.

32
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:11,140
Come on, Dad!

33
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:13,409
Maybe we can get the birds
to act out the <i>Benson</i>

34
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:15,912
where a scheduling snafu
forces the governor to decide

35
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:19,349
between meeting the president
or going to Katie's school play!

36
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:20,466
Yay!

37
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,018
Scatterbrained governor.

38
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:24,237
Welp, there she is.

39
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,405
A birdhouse.

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,840
I just hope whoever moves in

41
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:29,008
doesn't mind the Persian birds
next door.

42
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:30,577
(Persian accent):
Eh, tweet, tweet.

43
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:32,929
Check out my expensive fountain.

44
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:34,180
(bird chirping)

45
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:35,748
Dad, look.

46
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:38,351
(birds chirping)

47
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:40,353
You built
a great birdhouse, son.

48
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:41,654
I'm real proud of you.

49
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:42,822
Thanks, Dad.

50
00:01:42,857 --> 00:01:43,857
(screeching)

51
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:46,442
No!

52
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,493
What just happened?!

53
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:48,862
What was that thing?!

54
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:50,864
I don't know. Some
kind of super bird.

55
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:52,966
Or maybe an average bird
who bought a Bowflex.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,668
Well, that super bird
ruined everything!

57
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:57,537
Indeed, a force to
be reckoned with,

58
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:00,039
like Secretary of
Energy Steven Chu.

59
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:02,175
Secretary Chu,
Ways and Means

60
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,143
has sent over
a preliminary budget.

61
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:05,595
It looks like
the Department of Energy

62
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,830
is looking at
a four-percent budget cut.

63
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:09,716
(yelling)

64
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,084
Okay, no budget cut.

65
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:13,186
No budget cut.

66
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,241
Has anyone seen your father?

67
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:19,609
It's almost 6:00.

68
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:20,743
PETER:
I am here.

69
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:23,980
Family, I want you to
meet my falcon, Xerxes.

70
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:25,381
I'm a falconer now.

71
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,583
And yet for Christmas,

72
00:02:26,617 --> 00:02:28,618
I got a wrapped
scrambled egg.

73
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:29,869
(gasping)

74
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:31,638
Peter, that falcon
looks pretty dangerous.

75
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:33,189
Yeah, Peter, get rid
of that thing right now

76
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:34,190
and eat your dinner.

77
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:35,191
No!

78
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:36,192
I am a falconer

79
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:38,111
and I will eat
whatever Xerxes brings me.

80
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:39,862
Feed master.

81
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,418
Peter, what the hell?

82
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:51,557
For Xerxes,
every meal is a pageant.

83
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,143
Hey, Peter.

84
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:55,378
Oh, falcon. Cool.

85
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:56,412
Hi, falcon.

86
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:57,880
Whoa, whoa, easy
there, fella.

87
00:02:57,915 --> 00:02:59,882
Xerxes.
His name is Xerxes.

88
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,317
Uh, what does
Xerxes eat?

89
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:03,486
Rodents.
Now if you'll excuse me...

90
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,754
(screams)
What the hell?!

91
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:06,122
Peter, make him stop!

92
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:08,992
(chuckles) Hey, what do you got
going on down there, Quagmire?

93
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:10,627
You got a, you got
a rodent situation?

94
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:11,694
Uh, no!

95
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:13,229
Well, Xerxes seems
to think there is.

96
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:14,230
Get him off, Peter!

97
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:15,598
Admit you got
a rodent in there.

98
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:16,616
Peter!
Admit it!

99
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,117
(gagging)

100
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,852
Aw, you scared him
out the front.

101
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:21,170
Tony, come back!

102
00:03:27,478 --> 00:03:29,912
Oh, what... what...

103
00:03:29,947 --> 00:03:31,714
What do I do?
What do I do?

104
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:34,150
Well, just hope he's not
standing on your soft spot.

105
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:35,351
Well, is that possible?

106
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:36,906
Because that could
really mess up my...

107
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,156
(unintelligible slurring)

108
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,724
Mom, I need
money for lunch.

109
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,825
Oh, God.

110
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm sorry, Chris.

111
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:46,129
My purse has been
missing for a day now.

112
00:03:46,163 --> 00:03:47,463
I-I can't find
it anywhere.

113
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:48,498
Not to worry, Lois.

114
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:49,666
Xerxes will find it.

115
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,934
Xerxes, find Lois's purse.

116
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,455
(bleating)

117
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,506
This is
your purse now.

118
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:59,776
Peter, I can't carry
my money in this.

119
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,793
(screeching)

120
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:02,695
(scoffs)
Yeah, <i>her</i> money.

121
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:06,165
You're gonna love the park,
Xerxes.

122
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:10,153
(laughing, whooping)

123
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:12,605
I think you know
what I want.

124
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:15,808
This is awesome.

125
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,677
We should have our own TV show.

126
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,512
♪

127
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:53,179
So what do you think
about a platonic shower?

128
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:54,347
(doorbell rings)

129
00:04:55,783 --> 00:04:57,183
Are you Peter Griffin?

130
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:58,151
Yes, sir, I am.

131
00:04:58,185 --> 00:04:59,452
I represent the man

132
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:01,554
whose sidecar motorcycle
you stole yesterday.

133
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:03,122
You've piqued my
interest, go on.

134
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:06,559
Unfortunately for you,
that man is very, very Jewish

135
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:08,795
and is suing you
for everything you've got.

136
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:10,279
Including the falcon.

137
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:12,031
No! Not Xerxes!

138
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:16,035
You won't get away with this.

139
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,231
Wait till American Airlines'
magazine hears about this!

140
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:20,223
(dialing)

141
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:21,924
Hello, American Airlines'
magazine?

142
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,060
Have I got a scoop for you.

143
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:26,913
"Falcon stolen."

144
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:28,748
Ew, there's a toenail in this.

145
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,633
Guess I'll just go back
to coughing.

146
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:32,668
(coughing)

147
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:41,360
Now what are we gonna do?

148
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:42,628
We have no money.

149
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:45,231
That's okay, Lois,
we got a wonderful family.

150
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:46,365
No, we don't.

151
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,151
There's Meg and Dummy
and Big Head.

152
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,318
Damn it, Peter,

153
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:50,987
I'm probably gonna
have to get a job.

154
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:53,139
Oh, thank God. Thought I was
gonna have to go back

155
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,074
to being on
<i>Live with Kelly and Peter.</i>

156
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:58,227
So exhausting having to do
that open-mouth smile

157
00:05:58,262 --> 00:05:59,862
while the guest
does their bit.

158
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:02,598
We're here with <i>The Good</i>
<i>Wife's</i> Christine Baranski.

159
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,700
So, Christine, you've
actually won an Emmy,

160
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:05,768
is that right?

161
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:08,437
Yes, for playing
Maryann on <i>Cybill.</i>

162
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:09,839
Ah.

163
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:11,307
But my character
on <i>The Good Wife</i>

164
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:13,943
is such a complete
departure from Maryann.

165
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:15,411
Ah!

166
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,847
You've also had
quite a stage career.

167
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:19,549
I believe you
won a Tony Award?

168
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,450
Well, actually,
I've won two.

169
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:23,019
Ah!

170
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:24,420
And one more question,
darling.

171
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:25,555
Who are you?

172
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,729
Excuse me, would you mind
taking a look at my résumé?

173
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:35,581
I haven't had
an interview in a while,

174
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:38,734
and I want to make sure
it's formatted correctly.

175
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,206
Looks okay.
Good.

176
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,591
It's not too braggy?

177
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,627
Hi, I'm sorry,

178
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,328
I couldn't help
but overhear you.

179
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:51,330
You have an amazing
speaking voice.

180
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,632
My name's Randy.

181
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,901
I can get you steady work
with a voice like that.

182
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:55,902
Really?

183
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:57,503
Wow, thank you.

184
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:58,905
This is great.

185
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,507
Now I won't have to become
a Mary Kay saleswoman.

186
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,276
So, what makes
these shampoos

187
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,111
different from the ones
at the supermarket?

188
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:08,014
These shampoos
have been in my car.

189
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,419
Guess what everybody?

190
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:15,588
Oh, my God!
Tampons and groceries?

191
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:19,492
No-- well, yes--
but also I got discovered today.

192
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,777
I could be one of those
famous voice-over artists

193
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:24,096
you hear on TV or in the movies.

194
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:25,531
Ugh, her doing voice-over?

195
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:26,933
Who wants to hear that?

196
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,118
Maybe she could be one
of those annoying voices

197
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:31,704
that goes, "Ah, ah, ah,
not that product."

198
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:33,973
NARRATOR: <i>Which of these</i>
<i>leading brands of canned soup</i>

199
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:36,175
<i>has less than</i>
<i>a hundred grams of sodium?</i>

200
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,177
<i>Ah, ah, ah.Keep going.</i>

201
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:39,512
<i>Not that one.</i>

202
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:40,646
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

203
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:42,048
<i>Not that one either.</i>

204
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:43,216
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

205
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,483
<i>Nope, not that one.</i>

206
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:46,152
Look, this isn't even for me.

207
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:47,720
It's for my homosexual lover.

208
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:48,988
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

209
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:50,590
<i>The Bible's pretty clear</i>
<i>about that.</i>

210
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,745
Hi, I'm Lois Griffin.

211
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,730
I have an appointment
to see Randy.

212
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:00,566
Lois, I'm so glad
you decided to try this.

213
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,435
I can't believe
I'm a celebrity now.

214
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:03,869
I might hit
someone with my car

215
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:05,638
on the way home
just for kicks.

216
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:07,139
Well, I have a feeling

217
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:09,575
you're gonna be
a big star here.

218
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,711
(phones ringing,
men chattering)

219
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:13,179
What am I wearing?

220
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:15,648
(giggles)
Nothing at all, sweetheart.

221
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:17,216
Wait a minute.

222
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:19,352
This is a phone sex operation.

223
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:20,853
I can't do this.

224
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:22,622
It pays two grand
a week, sweetie.

225
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:23,689
Oh, my God.

226
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:24,991
With that
type of money,

227
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:27,493
I could buy pots and
pans at Williams-Sonoma.

228
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:29,595
This is a
very nice set.

229
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,030
You must be a
phone whore.

230
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:33,099
You bet your
sweet ass I am.

231
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:40,499
(phones ringing,
women chattering)

232
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:44,403
All right, Lois,
you know the drill.

233
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:45,638
And whatever you do,

234
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:47,823
do not mention computers
or the Internet.

235
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:50,126
They cannot
know about it.

236
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
(phone ringing)

237
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:52,461
Oh, dear.

238
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,331
Hello?

239
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,400
Uh, h-hi there...

240
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:58,401
(clears throat)

241
00:08:58,435 --> 00:08:59,769
...sexy.

242
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:01,270
I can tell you're
good at this.

243
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:03,973
Listen, I want to double-team
you on the phone with my son.

244
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,207
Oh.

245
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:06,976
Yeah, the family's
kind of falling apart.

246
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,295
And I'm just, uh...

247
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,597
just a dad trying to
keep it all together.

248
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:12,765
I see.

249
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,467
Are you into guys
in wheelchairs?

250
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:15,534
Not really.

251
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:16,802
Oh, that's too bad,

252
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:19,705
'cause, uh, my son's
in a wheelchair.

253
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:25,511
Hey, Lois.

254
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:27,046
So, how was your first day
of voice-over?

255
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,447
Eh, it was nothing.

256
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:29,782
Turns out,
I'm just doing

257
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:32,218
very obscure
European commercials.

258
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,653
You know,
I have got to get myself

259
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:35,021
back out there, too.

260
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:37,440
I haven't performed
since I was in Stewman Group.

261
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:39,475
(rhythmic drumming)

262
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,547
MAN: I don't get it.
What is this?

263
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,048
We don't know either.

264
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,353
(phone ringing)

265
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:52,555
Hi, my name's...

266
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:53,756
Classy.

267
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,992
What can I do for you,
hot stuff?

268
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:57,593
Ooh, hi, Classy.

269
00:09:57,627 --> 00:09:59,996
Listen, do you have
a wallet or a purse?

270
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,564
Uh, I have a purse.

271
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:02,398
Oh.

272
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:03,432
Oh, baby.

273
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,201
I want you to
take the money out

274
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:07,436
and count it
really slowly.

275
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:08,437
Okay.

276
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:09,438
One.

277
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:11,140
Ooh, that's nice.

278
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:12,274
Two.

279
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:14,276
Oh. Oh, my.

280
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:16,612
I'm sorry, the next bill
I have in here is a ten.

281
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:17,613
Oh!

282
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:18,647
Oh, I love you!

283
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:20,049
All that and
everything.

284
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,717
(phone ringing)

285
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:23,552
Hi, I'm Classy.

286
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:25,421
All right, let's get
this going, sweet cheeks.

287
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:26,422
You got a
handkerchief?

288
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,040
Uh, yeah.

289
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:30,443
Good, ball that up and
stick it in your mouth.

290
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:31,477
(mouth full):
Okay.

291
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:32,711
Now, what else
you got there?

292
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:34,030
You got a stapler?

293
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:35,731
Uh-huh, uh, yeah.

294
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:36,999
Okay, why don't
you go ahead

295
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:38,768
and stick that in
your mouth, too.

296
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:40,503
(choking)

297
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:41,804
How about a
mouse pad?

298
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:42,938
Uh-huh.

299
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:44,540
Yeah, go ahead
and roll that up

300
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:46,876
and stuff it
in there.

301
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,360
Did you get a
packet from HR

302
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:49,829
when you started
working there?

303
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:51,163
(muffled grunting)

304
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:52,732
Okay, I'll take
that as a yes.

305
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:56,068
And I'm pretty certain you know
what I want you to do with it.

306
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:57,753
(grunting)

307
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,406
Okay, you think you can fit
anything else in your mouth?

308
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,241
Mm-mm.
All right, so now let's start

309
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:03,909
filling up some
other places.

310
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:15,337
Peter, I've had
a long day at work,

311
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:18,340
and right now, sex is the last
thing I want to think about.

312
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,391
What the hell, Lois?

313
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:21,143
You never want
to do it no more.

314
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:24,547
What if I told you I'm
holding in a very big dump?

315
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:27,500
Peter, can't you just
use Sock Lois tonight?

316
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:31,120
No! Sock Lois doesn't feel
authentic to me anymore.

317
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:38,561
Hey, Joe, how often
do you have sex with Bonnie?

318
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,663
Well, my HMO only
pays for the equipment

319
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:42,064
once a year. Why?

320
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,400
Lois barely wants
to do it no more.

321
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:45,768
I'm going crazy here.

322
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:47,069
Ugh. I hear you.

323
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,871
Hey, Quagmire, do
yourself a favor:

324
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,339
don't get married.

325
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:51,474
I wasn't gonna.

326
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:52,908
Good. Don't.

327
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:53,943
I wasn't.

328
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:55,311
Perfect. Don't.

329
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:58,080
Joe, you telling me not to
has no effect on me whatsoever.

330
00:11:58,115 --> 00:11:59,381
I'm not gonna get married.

331
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,250
Great. Don't.

332
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:03,469
I mean it, you guys,
this no-sex thing doesn't work.

333
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:04,804
I need some kind
of outlet.

334
00:12:04,838 --> 00:12:07,173
You know, Peter,
I got just the thing for you.

335
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,041
There's this new phone sex
chick I been calling,

336
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,493
and she is amazing.

337
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:13,162
Gee, I don't know.
Isn't that cheating on Lois?

338
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:14,763
No, look, it's
over the phone.

339
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:16,866
It's like they say:
"Phonin' ain't bonin'."

340
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,934
Yeah. Well, I guess
I could try it.

341
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:20,069
Trust me, Peter.

342
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:21,837
Hey, I was right
about telling you

343
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:23,639
to go see the gynecologist,
wasn't I?

344
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:27,426
I'd like to see some
vaginas, please.

345
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,862
That's what we're here for.
Come on in.

346
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:42,708
(dialing)

347
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:44,643
Hello there, handsome.

348
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:46,145
I'm Classy.

349
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:49,782
Um, hi, Classy,
I'm, uh, Peter.

350
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:50,783
Peter...

351
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:51,984
Night Shyamalan.

352
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:54,153
They call me that
'cause I got a big twist

353
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:55,554
at the end
of my thing.

354
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:57,006
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

355
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,007
(clears throat)

356
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,543
Um... well,
hello, Peter.

357
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,478
What can I do for you?

358
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:05,014
Um, you want to see some
pictures that I drew?

359
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:06,899
Um, sure.

360
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,434
This is me
on a elephant.

361
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:10,302
Wow.
That's beautiful.

362
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:12,688
Did you draw that
all by yourself?

363
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:13,689
Uh-huh.

364
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:15,291
And this is me
on the moon.

365
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:16,725
I didn't really
go there.

366
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,227
It was just in
my imagination,

367
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,328
so I drawed it.

368
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:21,664
Wow, you're
really talented.

369
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:24,333
You know, there's something
about you, Classy.

370
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:25,768
Something special.

371
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:27,836
Aw, that's very sweet.

372
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:29,104
I like your voice.

373
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,273
It makes me want to
hear more of your voice.

374
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:32,841
Hey, you want to
see a funny comic?

375
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:34,343
Sure.

376
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:49,258
He's scared 'cause his friends
got killed in the pie.

377
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:57,366
So, Peter,
how was your day?

378
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,701
Eh, it was okay.

379
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:00,336
Except for that
Yokohama beef bowl

380
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,470
I tried for lunch.

381
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:02,605
Not sitting so well.

382
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,240
Just "okay"?

383
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:06,976
Didn't try
anything new today?

384
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,677
Talk to anyone
interesting?

385
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:09,812
No, not really.

386
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:11,680
Oh, that beef bowl
is wrecking me.

387
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:13,315
My stomach feels
like that time

388
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,017
I had explosive
diarrhea.

389
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:16,402
(farts loudly)

390
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:20,389
PETER:
<i>Brown house.</i>

391
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:24,576
(phone ringing)

392
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:25,577
Hello?

393
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:27,079
Um, hi, Classy.

394
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,280
It's Peter.

395
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:29,765
Oh, hi there.

396
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,433
(giggles) I love
when you talk.

397
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:34,019
Listen, um, I've had
such a good time

398
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:35,721
talking to you
these past few times

399
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:38,207
that I was thinking
maybe we could meet.

400
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:39,441
But you're married!

401
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:41,026
You've got a wife!

402
00:14:41,061 --> 00:14:43,112
Yeah, but she's been giving
me the cold shoulder lately.

403
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:44,443
Besides, anything
that comes out,

404
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:45,848
I can always
take home to her.

405
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:47,933
I don't think
this is a good idea.

406
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:51,337
I mean, cheating on your wife
is a very serious thing.

407
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:53,605
You don't understand,
I have to meet you.

408
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,307
I-I know it
seems sudden,

409
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:57,743
but I feel a special
connection with you.

410
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:59,511
Look, you name the
place and the time,

411
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:00,496
and I'll be there.

412
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,564
(whispers):
You son of a bitch!

413
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Okay.

414
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,285
I'll meet you.

415
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:07,353
Yay, I did it!

416
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:08,971
Thanks, Fairy God Peter!

417
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:12,191
Peter, the power was
within you all along.

418
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:14,943
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm
meeting Fairy God Quagmire

419
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:17,363
and Fairy God Joe down
at the Fairy God Clam.

420
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:19,648
That sounds like a gay bar.
It is a gay bar.

421
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:28,170
That's right, fellas,
I'm gonna meet her.

422
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:29,171
Meet who?

423
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:30,556
Yeah, what are you
talking about?

424
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,259
Oh, I-I thought we were starting
in the middle to save time.

425
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:34,577
The-the phone sex lady,

426
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:36,378
I'm gonna meet the phone sex
lady in person.

427
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:37,646
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute, Peter.

428
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:38,814
I wouldn't do that.

429
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:41,050
Hang on, Quagmire,
that's a bad idea.

430
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,551
You never want to meet

431
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:43,953
those phone sex
women in person.

432
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:45,471
Yeah, I know,
that's what I said.

433
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:46,472
I wouldn't do it.

434
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:47,806
Good. Don't.

435
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:49,561
Joe, Joe, you realize
what you're telling me

436
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:51,727
not to do,
I'm already not doing!

437
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:53,395
Okay, I know
you should never meet

438
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,496
a phone sex operator.

439
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,898
All right?
I'm not an idiot.

440
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:57,600
I would never meet one
of those people, ever.

441
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:59,251
Good. Don't.

442
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:01,787
Guys, I have to see
if she's as special in person

443
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:03,088
as she is on the phone.

444
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:04,623
Besides, if I listened
to you guys,

445
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:07,259
I never would've got that job
as a seat filler for fetuses.

446
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:09,662
Okay, let's take a look
at your baby, shall we?

447
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,215
Hi.

448
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,184
He'll be right back;
he's in the bathroom.

449
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:20,089
Thanks for
having me, Bonnie.

450
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:21,724
I just needed
someone to talk to.

451
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:22,725
Sure, Lois.

452
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,726
What's on your mind?

453
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,394
Well, it's kind
of a long story.

454
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:26,395
You see...

455
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:29,131
Eight (bleep) hours later...

456
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:30,532
Oh, my God!

457
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,268
So, as far as
Peter knows,

458
00:16:32,302 --> 00:16:33,869
he's about to
cheat on you?

459
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:35,938
Lois, you got to
draw the line here.

460
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:37,406
I know.

461
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,808
There's a lot of crazy things
I'll let Peter get away with.

462
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:40,943
I even held my tongue

463
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:43,045
when he went through
that anime phase.

464
00:16:43,063 --> 00:16:45,664
Hey, Lois, me make drive
time to super fun Clam

465
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,866
with noble Quagmire
and wheel-monster Joe.

466
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:50,102
Go, force!

467
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:04,733
Peter, what...

468
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:06,018
Why are you
dressed like that?

469
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:07,519
What did you do
to your hair?

470
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:09,622
Business trip, Lois.
Going to Chicago City.

471
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:11,256
Oh... okay.

472
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,524
I see.

473
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,759
And in case you're
wondering why

474
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:15,628
I don't have business
charts, yes, I do.

475
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:19,682
All right, I got to say
good-bye to the kids.

476
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:21,900
Hey, champ.

477
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:23,375
I want you to have
this pocket watch.

478
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:24,803
It still works,
even though it's got

479
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:26,572
a lot of Civil War
brains all over it.

480
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:30,943
Meg, I want you to have
this sad-sounding fart.

481
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:33,228
(farting)

482
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:36,215
Chris, people are
gonna tell you

483
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:38,617
that you're stupid and
that you're no good.

484
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:40,619
Bye, Otis!

485
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:52,798
That son of a bitch.

486
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,587
(knocking)

487
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,306
Hello.

488
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:02,925
You're...

489
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,326
you're beautiful.

490
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:06,161
So you got to meet me.

491
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:07,896
Are we gonna do
this or what?

492
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:10,499
Listen, I... I got to
be honest with you.

493
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,101
I am not, in fact,

494
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:13,736
the President
of Hot Wheels.

495
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,804
And I also lied about
the giant chef's hat.

496
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,306
I do not have one.

497
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,440
Mm-hmm.

498
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:20,075
Well, the small
lies don't matter.

499
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,110
Let's go.

500
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:25,214
(sighs)
Why am I doing this?

501
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:27,433
You know, I got the greatest
wife in the world.

502
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,351
And we have
one beautiful child.

503
00:18:29,386 --> 00:18:31,854
But did you ever feel like
something was missing?

504
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:33,689
You know,
something you had once,

505
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:35,140
but now it's gone?

506
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:37,793
You mean like the loyalty
of someone you trusted?

507
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:40,763
Yes, I know exactly
what that feels like.

508
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:42,664
Yeah, I mean, I was
just goofing around

509
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:45,167
when I first called you,
but when I heard your voice,

510
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:48,336
I-I felt like I found
some part of me that was lost.

511
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:50,639
Doesn't make any sense,
but it...

512
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:53,592
it felt like some force in
the universe wanted us together.

513
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:56,595
That's... kind of nice.

514
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:58,697
I guess I could understand that.

515
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:00,632
Now that you're here
in front of me,

516
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,435
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

517
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,788
♪

518
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,949
Eight (bleep) hours later...

519
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:24,006
Ah, I got to say,
I was fantastic.

520
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,276
You think so, you
dirty, rotten cheater?!

521
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,710
(gasps) Lois!

522
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:30,612
You-you-you-you
is the phone lady,

523
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,047
you the phone,
you the phone,

524
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:33,515
you is the phone lady,
you is the phone lady,

525
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,650
you is the phone lady...

526
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:36,702
You cheated on me!
Lois!

527
00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:38,487
Why the hell were
you doing phone sex?!

528
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:40,122
I was providing
for our family.

529
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:41,340
You were lying.

530
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:43,509
I'm starting to think
that whole Chicago City

531
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:45,327
business trip was just
a bunch of baloney!

532
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:46,595
That's not the point!

533
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:48,096
Well, if you think
about it,

534
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:50,616
I-I wasn't really cheating
'cause it was with you.

535
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,267
Well, you didn't
know that!

536
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:53,869
Yeah, but you know what?

537
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:56,438
In some way, I think I did.

538
00:19:56,473 --> 00:19:58,307
You know, when I heard
your voice on that phone,

539
00:19:58,341 --> 00:19:59,575
I-I felt something.

540
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:01,243
It was like an instinct,
you know?

541
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:02,978
Both my heart and my wiener

542
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:05,280
somehow knew
you were my soul mate.

543
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:07,549
Well...

544
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:10,252
I suppose you did
fall for me pretty hard.

545
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:11,320
Don't you see, Lois?

546
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:13,655
I fell in love with you
all over again.

547
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,025
And, look, now we just had the
best sex in years because of it.

548
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,195
I know. It's like our privates
were shaking hands

549
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,831
after a successful business
meeting in a swamp.

550
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:24,833
To me it... it just proves

551
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:27,169
that we're truly meant
to be together.

552
00:20:27,203 --> 00:20:29,838
Oh, I love you, Peter.

553
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:31,707
I love you, too, Lois.

554
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:38,213
By the way, you may have to
become a full-on prostitute,

555
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:40,716
'cause our phone bill
was $7,000.

556
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:46,255
Oh, Peter.

557
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:49,691
I want you to do me so hard
that we have to change churches.

558
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:50,843
Gross!

559
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:53,379
I want to wreck you so bad,

560
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,030
you'll look like
an exploded Hot Pocket.

561
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:56,499
Oh, my God!

562
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:01,472
STEWIE: Can I interest you guys
in a two-and-a-quarter way?

563
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:06,506
