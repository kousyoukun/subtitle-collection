12
00:00:36,422 --> 00:00:38,090
Hey, Chris, what
do you got there?

13
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:40,325
I made a birdhouse
at school today.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,743
Oh, looks an
awful lot like

15
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:43,445
the Governor's
Mansion from <i>Benson.</i>

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,147
It is.
I'm fond of the series,

17
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:47,382
and I wanted the local birds
to be aware of that.

18
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:48,984
Well, I'll be on the lookout
for great tits.

19
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:50,252
Peter!

20
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,837
Well, actually, Lois,
that's a species of bird

21
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:54,106
that's known to frequent
domestic birdhouses.

22
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,824
It's why I've always
wanted a birdhouse.

23
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:56,899
Hey, Lois,
let's go outside

24
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:58,477
and see if we can
find some great tits.

25
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:00,145
'Cause there certainly
ain't any in here!

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,347
Remember those two
we saw last night?

27
00:01:02,382 --> 00:01:04,049
One was bigger
than the other.

28
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,667
Yeah, and-and the bigger one
had a hair

29
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:07,102
sticking out
of that pointy thing.

30
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,937
What do you call
that pointy thing, again?

31
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:09,972
The beak?
Okay.

32
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,139
Come on, Dad!

33
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:13,408
Maybe we can get the birds
to act out the <i>Benson</i>

34
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:15,911
where a scheduling snafu
forces the governor to decide

35
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:19,348
between meeting the president
or going to Katie's school play!

36
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:20,465
Yay!

37
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,017
Scatterbrained governor.

38
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:24,236
Welp, there she is.

39
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,404
A birdhouse.

40
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:26,839
I just hope whoever moves in

41
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:29,007
doesn't mind the Persian birds
next door.

42
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:30,576
Eh, tweet, tweet.

43
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,928
Check out my expensive fountain.

44
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:35,747
Dad, look.

45
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:40,352
You built
a great birdhouse, son.

46
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:41,653
I'm real proud of you.

47
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:42,821
Thanks, Dad.

48
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:46,441
No!

49
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:47,492
What just happened?!

50
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:48,861
What was that thing?!

51
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:50,863
I don't know. Some
kind of super bird.

52
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:52,965
Or maybe an average bird
who bought a Bowflex.

53
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:55,667
Well, that super bird
ruined everything!

54
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:57,536
Indeed, a force to
be reckoned with,

55
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,038
like Secretary of
Energy Steven Chu.

56
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:02,174
Secretary Chu,
Ways and Means

57
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,142
has sent over
a preliminary budget.

58
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:05,594
It looks like
the Department of Energy

59
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:07,829
is looking at
a four-percent budget cut.

60
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:11,083
Okay, no budget cut.

61
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:13,185
No budget cut.

62
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,240
Has anyone seen your father?

63
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,608
It's almost 6:00.

64
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:20,742
I am here.

65
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:23,979
Family, I want you to
meet my falcon, Xerxes.

66
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,380
I'm a falconer now.

67
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:26,582
And yet for Christmas,

68
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,617
I got a wrapped
scrambled egg.

69
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:31,637
Peter, that falcon
looks pretty dangerous.

70
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:33,188
Yeah, Peter, get rid
of that thing right now

71
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:34,189
and eat your dinner.

72
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:35,190
No!

73
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:36,191
I am a falconer

74
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:38,110
and I will eat
whatever Xerxes brings me.

75
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:39,861
Feed master.

76
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,417
Peter, what the hell?

77
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:51,556
For Xerxes,
every meal is a pageant.

78
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,142
Hey, Peter.

79
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:55,377
Oh, falcon. Cool.

80
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:56,411
Hi, falcon.

81
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:57,879
Whoa, whoa, easy
there, fella.

82
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,881
Xerxes.
His name is Xerxes.

83
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,316
Uh, what does
Xerxes eat?

84
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:03,485
Rodents.
Now if you'll excuse me...

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,753
What the hell?!

86
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:06,121
Peter, make him stop!

87
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:08,991
Hey, what do you got
going on down there, Quagmire?

88
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,626
You got a, you got
a rodent situation?

89
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,693
Uh, no!

90
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,228
Well, Xerxes seems
to think there is.

91
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:14,229
Get him off, Peter!

92
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:15,597
Admit you got
a rodent in there.

93
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:16,615
Peter!
Admit it!

94
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,851
Aw, you scared him
out the front.

95
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:21,169
Tony, come back!

96
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:29,911
Oh, what... what...

97
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:31,713
What do I do?
What do I do?

98
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:34,149
Well, just hope he's not
standing on your soft spot.

99
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:35,350
Well, is that possible?

100
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:36,905
Because that could
really mess up my...

101
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,723
Mom, I need
money for lunch.

102
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:42,824
Oh, God.

103
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:43,959
I'm sorry, Chris.

104
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:46,128
My purse has been
missing for a day now.

105
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:47,462
I-I can't find
it anywhere.

106
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:48,497
Not to worry, Lois.

107
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:49,665
Xerxes will find it.

108
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,933
Xerxes, find Lois's purse.

109
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,505
This is
your purse now.

110
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:59,775
Peter, I can't carry
my money in this.

111
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:02,694
Yeah, <i>her</i> money.

112
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:06,164
You're gonna love the park,
Xerxes.

113
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:12,604
I think you know
what I want.

114
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:15,807
This is awesome.

115
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:17,676
We should have our own TV show.

116
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:19,511
♪

117
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:53,178
So what do you think
about a platonic shower?

118
00:04:55,782 --> 00:04:57,182
Are you Peter Griffin?

119
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:58,150
Yes, sir, I am.

120
00:04:58,184 --> 00:04:59,451
I represent the man

121
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:01,553
whose sidecar motorcycle
you stole yesterday.

122
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:03,121
You've piqued my
interest, go on.

123
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:06,558
Unfortunately for you,
that man is very, very Jewish

124
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:08,794
and is suing you
for everything you've got.

125
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:10,278
Including the falcon.

126
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:12,030
No! Not Xerxes!

127
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,034
You won't get away with this.

128
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,230
Wait till American Airlines'
magazine hears about this!

129
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:21,923
Hello, American Airlines'
magazine?

130
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,059
Have I got a scoop for you.

131
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:26,912
"Falcon stolen."

132
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,747
Ew, there's a toenail in this.

133
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:30,632
Guess I'll just go back
to coughing.

134
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,359
Now what are we gonna do?

135
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:42,627
We have no money.

136
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:45,230
That's okay, Lois,
we got a wonderful family.

137
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:46,364
No, we don't.

138
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,150
There's Meg and Dummy
and Big Head.

139
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:49,317
Damn it, Peter,

140
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:50,986
I'm probably gonna
have to get a job.

141
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,138
Oh, thank God. Thought I was
gonna have to go back

142
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:55,073
to being on
<i>Live with Kelly and Peter.</i>

143
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:58,226
So exhausting having to do
that open-mouth smile

144
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,861
while the guest
does their bit.

145
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:02,597
We're here with <i>The Good</i>
<i>Wife's</i> Christine Baranski.

146
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:04,699
So, Christine, you've
actually won an Emmy,

147
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:05,767
is that right?

148
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:08,436
Yes, for playing
Maryann on <i>Cybill.</i>

149
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:09,838
Ah.

150
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:11,306
But my character
on <i>The Good Wife</i>

151
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,942
is such a complete
departure from Maryann.

152
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,410
Ah!

153
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,846
You've also had
quite a stage career.

154
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,548
I believe you
won a Tony Award?

155
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:21,449
Well, actually,
I've won two.

156
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:23,018
Ah!

157
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:24,419
And one more question,
darling.

158
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:25,554
Who are you?

159
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:33,728
Excuse me, would you mind
taking a look at my résumé?

160
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:35,580
I haven't had
an interview in a while,

161
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:38,733
and I want to make sure
it's formatted correctly.

162
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:43,205
Looks okay.
Good.

163
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:45,590
It's not too braggy?

164
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,626
Hi, I'm sorry,

165
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,327
I couldn't help
but overhear you.

166
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:51,329
You have an amazing
speaking voice.

167
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,631
My name's Randy.

168
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,900
I can get you steady work
with a voice like that.

169
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:55,901
Really?

170
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:57,502
Wow, thank you.

171
00:06:57,537 --> 00:06:58,904
This is great.

172
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:01,506
Now I won't have to become
a Mary Kay saleswoman.

173
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,275
So, what makes
these shampoos

174
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:05,110
different from the ones
at the supermarket?

175
00:07:05,144 --> 00:07:08,013
These shampoos
have been in my car.

176
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:13,418
Guess what everybody?

177
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:15,587
Oh, my God!
Tampons and groceries?

178
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:19,491
No-- well, yes--
but also I got discovered today.

179
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:21,776
I could be one of those
famous voice-over artists

180
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:24,095
you hear on TV or in the movies.

181
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,530
Ugh, her doing voice-over?

182
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:26,932
Who wants to hear that?

183
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:29,117
Maybe she could be one
of those annoying voices

184
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:31,703
that goes, "Ah, ah, ah,
not that product."

185
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:33,972
<i>Which of these</i>
<i>leading brands of canned soup</i>

186
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:36,174
<i>has less than</i>
<i>a hundred grams of sodium?</i>

187
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,176
<i>Ah, ah, ah.Keep going.</i>

188
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:39,511
<i>Not that one.</i>

189
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:40,645
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

190
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,047
<i>Not that one either.</i>

191
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:43,215
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

192
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:44,482
<i>Nope, not that one.</i>

193
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,151
Look, this isn't even for me.

194
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:47,719
It's for my homosexual lover.

195
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:48,987
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

196
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,589
<i>The Bible's pretty clear</i>
<i>about that.</i>

197
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,744
Hi, I'm Lois Griffin.

198
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:57,729
I have an appointment
to see Randy.

199
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,565
Lois, I'm so glad
you decided to try this.

200
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,434
I can't believe
I'm a celebrity now.

201
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:03,868
I might hit
someone with my car

202
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,637
on the way home
just for kicks.

203
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:07,138
Well, I have a feeling

204
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:09,574
you're gonna be
a big star here.

205
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:13,178
What am I wearing?

206
00:08:13,212 --> 00:08:15,647
Nothing at all, sweetheart.

207
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,215
Wait a minute.

208
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,351
This is a phone sex operation.

209
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:20,852
I can't do this.

210
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:22,621
It pays two grand
a week, sweetie.

211
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:23,688
Oh, my God.

212
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:24,990
With that
type of money,

213
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:27,492
I could buy pots and
pans at Williams-Sonoma.

214
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:29,594
This is a
very nice set.

215
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:31,029
You must be a
phone whore.

216
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:33,098
You bet your
sweet ass I am.

217
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:44,402
All right, Lois,
you know the drill.

218
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:45,637
And whatever you do,

219
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:47,822
do not mention computers
or the Internet.

220
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:50,125
They cannot
know about it.

221
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:52,460
Oh, dear.

222
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,330
Hello?

223
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:57,399
Uh, h-hi there...

224
00:08:58,434 --> 00:08:59,768
...sexy.

225
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:01,269
I can tell you're
good at this.

226
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:03,972
Listen, I want to double-team
you on the phone with my son.

227
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:05,206
Oh.

228
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:06,975
Yeah, the family's
kind of falling apart.

229
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:09,294
And I'm just, uh...

230
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:11,596
just a dad trying to
keep it all together.

231
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:12,764
I see.

232
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,466
Are you into guys
in wheelchairs?

233
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,533
Not really.

234
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:16,801
Oh, that's too bad,

235
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:19,704
'cause, uh, my son's
in a wheelchair.

236
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:25,510
Hey, Lois.

237
00:09:25,544 --> 00:09:27,045
So, how was your first day
of voice-over?

238
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,446
Eh, it was nothing.

239
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:29,781
Turns out,
I'm just doing

240
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:32,217
very obscure
European commercials.

241
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,652
You know,
I have got to get myself

242
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,020
back out there, too.

243
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:37,439
I haven't performed
since I was in Stewman Group.

244
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:44,546
I don't get it.
What is this?

245
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,047
We don't know either.

246
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:52,554
Hi, my name's...

247
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:53,755
Classy.

248
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:55,991
What can I do for you,
hot stuff?

249
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:57,592
Ooh, hi, Classy.

250
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,995
Listen, do you have
a wallet or a purse?

251
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:01,563
Uh, I have a purse.

252
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:02,397
Oh.

253
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,431
Oh, baby.

254
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,200
I want you to
take the money out

255
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:07,435
and count it
really slowly.

256
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,436
Okay.

257
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:09,437
One.

258
00:10:09,472 --> 00:10:11,139
Ooh, that's nice.

259
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:12,273
Two.

260
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:14,275
Oh. Oh, my.

261
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,611
I'm sorry, the next bill
I have in here is a ten.

262
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:17,612
Oh!

263
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:18,646
Oh, I love you!

264
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:20,048
All that and
everything.

265
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,551
Hi, I'm Classy.

266
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:25,420
All right, let's get
this going, sweet cheeks.

267
00:10:25,454 --> 00:10:26,421
You got a
handkerchief?

268
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:28,039
Uh, yeah.

269
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,442
Good, ball that up and
stick it in your mouth.

270
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:31,476
Okay.

271
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,710
Now, what else
you got there?

272
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:34,029
You got a stapler?

273
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:35,730
Uh-huh, uh, yeah.

274
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:36,998
Okay, why don't
you go ahead

275
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,767
and stick that in
your mouth, too.

276
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:41,803
How about a
mouse pad?

277
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:42,937
Uh-huh.

278
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:44,539
Yeah, go ahead
and roll that up

279
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:46,875
and stuff it
in there.

280
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:48,359
Did you get a
packet from HR

281
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:49,828
when you started
working there?

282
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:52,731
Okay, I'll take
that as a yes.

283
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:56,067
And I'm pretty certain you know
what I want you to do with it.

284
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:00,405
Okay, you think you can fit
anything else in your mouth?

285
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,240
Mm-mm.
All right, so now let's start

286
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:03,908
filling up some
other places.

287
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:15,336
Peter, I've had
a long day at work,

288
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:18,339
and right now, sex is the last
thing I want to think about.

289
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:19,390
What the hell, Lois?

290
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,142
You never want
to do it no more.

291
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:24,546
What if I told you I'm
holding in a very big dump?

292
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,499
Peter, can't you just
use Sock Lois tonight?

293
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:31,119
No! Sock Lois doesn't feel
authentic to me anymore.

294
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,560
Hey, Joe, how often
do you have sex with Bonnie?

295
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:40,662
Well, my HMO only
pays for the equipment

296
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:42,063
once a year. Why?

297
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:44,399
Lois barely wants
to do it no more.

298
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:45,767
I'm going crazy here.

299
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:47,068
Ugh. I hear you.

300
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:48,870
Hey, Quagmire, do
yourself a favor:

301
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:50,338
don't get married.

302
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:51,473
I wasn't gonna.

303
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:52,907
Good. Don't.

304
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:53,942
I wasn't.

305
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:55,310
Perfect. Don't.

306
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:58,079
Joe, you telling me not to
has no effect on me whatsoever.

307
00:11:58,114 --> 00:11:59,380
I'm not gonna get married.

308
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:01,249
Great. Don't.

309
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:03,468
I mean it, you guys,
this no-sex thing doesn't work.

310
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:04,803
I need some kind
of outlet.

311
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,172
You know, Peter,
I got just the thing for you.

312
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:09,040
There's this new phone sex
chick I been calling,

313
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:10,492
and she is amazing.

314
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:13,161
Gee, I don't know.
Isn't that cheating on Lois?

315
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:14,762
No, look, it's
over the phone.

316
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,865
It's like they say:
"Phonin' ain't bonin'."

317
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,933
Yeah. Well, I guess
I could try it.

318
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:20,068
Trust me, Peter.

319
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:21,836
Hey, I was right
about telling you

320
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:23,638
to go see the gynecologist,
wasn't I?

321
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:27,425
I'd like to see some
vaginas, please.

322
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,861
That's what we're here for.
Come on in.

323
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,642
Hello there, handsome.

324
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:46,144
I'm Classy.

325
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:49,781
Um, hi, Classy,
I'm, uh, Peter.

326
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:50,782
Peter...

327
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:51,983
Night Shyamalan.

328
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:54,152
They call me that
'cause I got a big twist

329
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:55,553
at the end
of my thing.

330
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,005
Oh, my God.

331
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,542
Um... well,
hello, Peter.

332
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:02,477
What can I do for you?

333
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:05,013
Um, you want to see some
pictures that I drew?

334
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,898
Um, sure.

335
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,433
This is me
on a elephant.

336
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,301
Wow.
That's beautiful.

337
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,687
Did you draw that
all by yourself?

338
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:13,688
Uh-huh.

339
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:15,290
And this is me
on the moon.

340
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:16,724
I didn't really
go there.

341
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,226
It was just in
my imagination,

342
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,327
so I drawed it.

343
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:21,663
Wow, you're
really talented.

344
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:24,332
You know, there's something
about you, Classy.

345
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:25,767
Something special.

346
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:27,835
Aw, that's very sweet.

347
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,103
I like your voice.

348
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:31,272
It makes me want to
hear more of your voice.

349
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:32,840
Hey, you want to
see a funny comic?

350
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,342
Sure.

351
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:49,257
He's scared 'cause his friends
got killed in the pie.

352
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:57,365
So, Peter,
how was your day?

353
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,700
Eh, it was okay.

354
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:00,335
Except for that
Yokohama beef bowl

355
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:01,469
I tried for lunch.

356
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:02,604
Not sitting so well.

357
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:04,239
Just "okay"?

358
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:06,975
Didn't try
anything new today?

359
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,676
Talk to anyone
interesting?

360
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:09,811
No, not really.

361
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:11,679
Oh, that beef bowl
is wrecking me.

362
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:13,314
My stomach feels
like that time

363
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:15,016
I had explosive
diarrhea.

364
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:20,388
<i>Brown house.</i>

365
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,576
Hello?

366
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:27,078
Um, hi, Classy.

367
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:28,279
It's Peter.

368
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:29,764
Oh, hi there.

369
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:31,432
I love
when you talk.

370
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:34,018
Listen, um, I've had
such a good time

371
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:35,720
talking to you
these past few times

372
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:38,206
that I was thinking
maybe we could meet.

373
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
But you're married!

374
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:41,025
You've got a wife!

375
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,111
Yeah, but she's been giving
me the cold shoulder lately.

376
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,442
Besides, anything
that comes out,

377
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:45,847
I can always
take home to her.

378
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:47,932
I don't think
this is a good idea.

379
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:51,336
I mean, cheating on your wife
is a very serious thing.

380
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,604
You don't understand,
I have to meet you.

381
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,306
I-I know it
seems sudden,

382
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,742
but I feel a special
connection with you.

383
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:59,510
Look, you name the
place and the time,

384
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:00,495
and I'll be there.

385
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,563
You son of a bitch!

386
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:04,699
Okay.

387
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,284
I'll meet you.

388
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:07,352
Yay, I did it!

389
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:08,970
Thanks, Fairy God Peter!

390
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:12,190
Peter, the power was
within you all along.

391
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:14,942
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm
meeting Fairy God Quagmire

392
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:17,362
and Fairy God Joe down
at the Fairy God Clam.

393
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:19,647
That sounds like a gay bar.
It is a gay bar.

394
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:28,169
That's right, fellas,
I'm gonna meet her.

395
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:29,170
Meet who?

396
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:30,555
Yeah, what are you
talking about?

397
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,258
Oh, I-I thought we were starting
in the middle to save time.

398
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,576
The-the phone sex lady,

399
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,377
I'm gonna meet the phone sex
lady in person.

400
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:37,645
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute, Peter.

401
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,813
I wouldn't do that.

402
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:41,049
Hang on, Quagmire,
that's a bad idea.

403
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,550
You never want to meet

404
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:43,952
those phone sex
women in person.

405
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,470
Yeah, I know,
that's what I said.

406
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:46,471
I wouldn't do it.

407
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:47,805
Good. Don't.

408
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,560
Joe, Joe, you realize
what you're telling me

409
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:51,726
not to do,
I'm already not doing!

410
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,394
Okay, I know
you should never meet

411
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:54,495
a phone sex operator.

412
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,897
All right?
I'm not an idiot.

413
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:57,599
I would never meet one
of those people, ever.

414
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:59,250
Good. Don't.

415
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:01,786
Guys, I have to see
if she's as special in person

416
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,087
as she is on the phone.

417
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:04,622
Besides, if I listened
to you guys,

418
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:07,258
I never would've got that job
as a seat filler for fetuses.

419
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:09,661
Okay, let's take a look
at your baby, shall we?

420
00:16:11,914 --> 00:16:13,214
Hi.

421
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:15,183
He'll be right back;
he's in the bathroom.

422
00:16:18,254 --> 00:16:20,088
Thanks for
having me, Bonnie.

423
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:21,723
I just needed
someone to talk to.

424
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:22,724
Sure, Lois.

425
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:23,725
What's on your mind?

426
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,393
Well, it's kind
of a long story.

427
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:26,394
You see...

428
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,130
Eight  hours later...

429
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:30,531
Oh, my God!

430
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:32,267
So, as far as
Peter knows,

431
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:33,868
he's about to
cheat on you?

432
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:35,937
Lois, you got to
draw the line here.

433
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:37,405
I know.

434
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,807
There's a lot of crazy things
I'll let Peter get away with.

435
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:40,942
I even held my tongue

436
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:43,044
when he went through
that anime phase.

437
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:45,663
Hey, Lois, me make drive
time to super fun Clam

438
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:47,865
with noble Quagmire
and wheel-monster Joe.

439
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,101
Go, force!

440
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:04,732
Peter, what...

441
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,017
Why are you
dressed like that?

442
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:07,518
What did you do
to your hair?

443
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:09,621
Business trip, Lois.
Going to Chicago City.

444
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,255
Oh... okay.

445
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,523
I see.

446
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:13,758
And in case you're
wondering why

447
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,627
I don't have business
charts, yes, I do.

448
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:19,681
All right, I got to say
good-bye to the kids.

449
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:21,899
Hey, champ.

450
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:23,374
I want you to have
this pocket watch.

451
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,802
It still works,
even though it's got

452
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:26,571
a lot of Civil War
brains all over it.

453
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,942
Meg, I want you to have
this sad-sounding fart.

454
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:36,214
Chris, people are
gonna tell you

455
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,616
that you're stupid and
that you're no good.

456
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:40,618
Bye, Otis!

457
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,797
That son of a bitch.

458
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:01,305
Hello.

459
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,924
You're...

460
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,325
you're beautiful.

461
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,160
So you got to meet me.

462
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:07,895
Are we gonna do
this or what?

463
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,498
Listen, I... I got to
be honest with you.

464
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:12,100
I am not, in fact,

465
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,735
the President
of Hot Wheels.

466
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:15,803
And I also lied about
the giant chef's hat.

467
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:17,305
I do not have one.

468
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:18,439
Mm-hmm.

469
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:20,074
Well, the small
lies don't matter.

470
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:21,109
Let's go.

471
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:25,213
Why am I doing this?

472
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:27,432
You know, I got the greatest
wife in the world.

473
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,350
And we have
one beautiful child.

474
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:31,853
But did you ever feel like
something was missing?

475
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,688
You know,
something you had once,

476
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:35,139
but now it's gone?

477
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:37,792
You mean like the loyalty
of someone you trusted?

478
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,762
Yes, I know exactly
what that feels like.

479
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,663
Yeah, I mean, I was
just goofing around

480
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:45,166
when I first called you,
but when I heard your voice,

481
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:48,335
I-I felt like I found
some part of me that was lost.

482
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,638
Doesn't make any sense,
but it...

483
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,591
it felt like some force in
the universe wanted us together.

484
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,594
That's... kind of nice.

485
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,696
I guess I could understand that.

486
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:00,631
Now that you're here
in front of me,

487
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,434
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

488
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:05,787
♪

489
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,948
Eight  hours later...

490
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:24,005
Ah, I got to say,
I was fantastic.

491
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,275
You think so, you
dirty, rotten cheater?!

492
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:28,709
Lois!

493
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:30,611
You-you-you-you
is the phone lady,

494
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:32,046
you the phone,
you the phone,

495
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,514
you is the phone lady,
you is the phone lady,

496
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,649
you is the phone lady...

497
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:36,701
You cheated on me!
Lois!

498
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:38,486
Why the hell were
you doing phone sex?!

499
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,121
I was providing
for our family.

500
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:41,339
You were lying.

501
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:43,508
I'm starting to think
that whole Chicago City

502
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,326
business trip was just
a bunch of baloney!

503
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,594
That's not the point!

504
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:48,095
Well, if you think
about it,

505
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,615
I-I wasn't really cheating
'cause it was with you.

506
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,266
Well, you didn't
know that!

507
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:53,868
Yeah, but you know what?

508
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,437
In some way, I think I did.

509
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:58,306
You know, when I heard
your voice on that phone,

510
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,574
I-I felt something.

511
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:01,242
It was like an instinct,
you know?

512
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:02,977
Both my heart and my wiener

513
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:05,279
somehow knew
you were my soul mate.

514
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:07,548
Well...

515
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,251
I suppose you did
fall for me pretty hard.

516
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:11,319
Don't you see, Lois?

517
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:13,654
I fell in love with you
all over again.

518
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:17,024
And, look, now we just had the
best sex in years because of it.

519
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,194
I know. It's like our privates
were shaking hands

520
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:22,830
after a successful business
meeting in a swamp.

521
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:24,832
To me it... it just proves

522
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:27,168
that we're truly meant
to be together.

523
00:20:27,202 --> 00:20:29,837
Oh, I love you, Peter.

524
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:31,706
I love you, too, Lois.

525
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:38,212
By the way, you may have to
become a full-on prostitute,

526
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:40,715
'cause our phone bill
was $7,000.

527
00:20:44,486 --> 00:20:46,254
Oh, Peter.

528
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:49,690
I want you to do me so hard
that we have to change churches.

529
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:50,842
Gross!

530
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,378
I want to wreck you so bad,

531
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:55,029
you'll look like
an exploded Hot Pocket.

532
00:20:55,064 --> 00:20:56,498
Oh, my God!

533
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:01,471
Can I interest you guys
in a two-and-a-quarter way?

534
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:06,505
