嘿 Chris 你拿的是什么
Hey, Chris, what do you got there?

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,570
我今天在学校建了栋鸟舍
I made a birdhouse at school today.

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,690
噢 看着超像"管家本森"里的州长官邸
Oh, looks an awful lot like the Governor's Mansion from Benson.

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,690
ABC台 1979-1986年 播出的情景喜剧

17
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,390
是的 我喜欢那部剧
It is. I'm fond of the series,

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,630
所以我想让当地的鸟儿们也知道
and I wanted the local birds to be aware of that.

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,230
那么 我会留意着那些极好的山雀们(咪咪)
Well, I'll be on the lookout for great tits.

20
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,500
Peter!

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,080
Lois 那其实是一种鸟
Well, actually, Lois, that's a species of bird

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,350
众所周知是国内鸟舍中最常见的一种
that's known to frequent domestic birdhouses.

23
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,070
这就是为啥我总想要个鸟舍
It's why I've always wanted a birdhouse.

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,150
嘿 Lois  我们一起出去
Hey, Lois, let's go outside

25
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,720
看知否能找到点极好的山雀(咪咪)吧
and see if we can find some great tits.

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,390
因为这房子里肯定是没有的
'Cause there certainly ain't any in here!

27
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,590
还记得我们昨晚看到的那两只么
Remember those two we saw last night?

28
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,300
其中一只比另一只大
One was bigger than the other.

29
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,350
没错 而且较大那只的尖端还有根毛伸出来
Yeah, and-and the bigger one had a hair sticking out of that pointy thing.

30
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,180
那玩意儿叫什么来着?
What do you call that pointy thing, again?

31
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,220
- 喙 - 好吧
- The beak? - Okay.

32
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,390
来吧 老爸
Come on, Dad!

33
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,650
也许我们能让鸟儿们演出"管家本森"里的剧情
Maybe we can get the birds to act out the Benson

34
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,160
在那集中混乱的日程安排让州长纠结于
where a scheduling snafu forces the governor to decide

35
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,590
是去会见总统还是看女儿Katie的校园剧
between meeting the president or going to Katie's school play!

36
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,710
吔
Yay!

37
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,260
糊涂州长
Scatterbrained governor.

38
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,480
安置好了
Welp, there she is.

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,650
一栋鸟舍
A birdhouse.

40
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,250
我只希望搬进来的鸟儿不要介意隔壁的波斯鸟
I just hope whoever moves in doesn't mind the Persian birds next door.

41
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,820
呃 吱吱 吱吱
Eh, tweet, tweet.

42
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,170
瞧瞧咱奢侈的喷泉
Check out my expensive fountain.

43
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,990
老爸 瞧
Dad, look.

44
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,600
你建了栋了不起的鸟舍 儿子
You built a great birdhouse, son.

45
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,900
我真为你骄傲
I'm real proud of you.

46
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,070
谢了 爸
Thanks, Dad.

47
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,690
不 
No!

48
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,740
刚才发生了什么
What just happened?!

49
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,110
那是什么东西
What was that thing?!

50
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,110
我不知道 某种超级鸟
I don't know. Some kind of super bird.

51
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,210
或者是一只买了博飞健身器材的普通鸟
Or maybe an average bird who bought a Bowflex.

52
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,910
那只超级鸟毁了一切
Well, that super bird ruined everything!

53
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,780
没错 一个不可忽视的力量
Indeed, a force to be reckoned with,

54
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,280
就像能源部部长朱棣文
like Secretary of Energy Steven Chu.

55
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,390
朱部长 筹款委员会已经送来了初步预算
Secretary Chu, Ways and Means has sent over a preliminary budget.

56
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,080
看来能源部要减少4%的预算了
It looks like the Department of Energy is looking at a four-percent budget cut.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,330
好不 不削减预算
Okay, no budget cut.

58
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,430
不许削减预算
No budget cut.

59
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,490
看见你们父亲了没
Has anyone seen your father?

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,850
都快6点了
It's almost 6:00.

61
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,990
我在这儿呢
PETER: I am here.

62
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,230
家人们 来见见我的猎鹰 Xerxes
Family, I want you to meet my falcon, Xerxes.

63
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,630
我现在是训鹰者了
I'm a falconer now.

64
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,860
可我的圣诞节礼物依旧是打包的炒蛋
And yet for Christmas, I got a wrapped scrambled egg.

65
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,880
Peter 那鹰看上去很危险
Peter, that falcon looks pretty dangerous.

66
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,440
是啊 Peter 赶紧把它弄走 吃晚饭吧
Yeah, Peter, get rid of that thing right now and eat your dinner.

67
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,440
不要
No!

68
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,440
我是个训鹰者
I am a falconer

69
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,360
我会吃Xerxes带给我的任何东西
and I will eat whatever Xerxes brings me.

70
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,110
给主人找吃的
Feed master.

71
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,660
Peter 搞毛啊
Peter, what the hell?

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,800
对Xerxes 每顿饭都是盛宴
For Xerxes, every meal is a pageant.

73
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,390
嘿 Peter 
Hey, Peter.

74
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,620
噢 猎鹰 酷
Oh, falcon. Cool.

75
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,660
嗨 猎鹰
Hi, falcon.

76
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,130
喔 喔 放松 伙计
Whoa, whoa, easy there, fella.

77
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,130
Xerxes 他叫Xerxes
Xerxes. His name is Xerxes.

78
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,560
呃 他吃什么
Uh, what does Xerxes eat?

79
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,730
啮齿动物 现在如果你不介意的话...
Rodents. Now if you'll excuse me...

80
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,000
搞什么鬼
What the hell?!

81
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,370
Peter 让他住手
Peter, make him stop!

82
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,240
嘿 你那下面是有什么东西啊 quagmire
Hey, what do you got going on down there, Quagmire?

83
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,870
你藏了 你藏了只老鼠么
You got a, you got a rodent situation?

84
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,940
哦 没有
Uh, no!

85
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,470
但看来Xerxes认为那儿有
Well, Xerxes seems to think there is.

86
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,480
把他弄下去 Peter
Get him off, Peter!

87
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,840
承认你有只老鼠在里面吧
Admit you got a rodent in there.

88
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,860
- Peter - 承认
- Peter! - Admit it!

89
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,100
靠 你吓的他从前面跑了
Aw, you scared him out the front.

90
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,420
Tony 回来
Tony, come back!

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,160
噢 怎...怎么...
Oh, what... what...

92
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,960
我该怎么办 我该怎么办
What do I do? What do I do?

93
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,400
只能希望他没站在你的囟门上
Well, just hope he's not standing on your soft spot.

94
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,600
有那个可能么
Well, is that possible?

95
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,150
那样可就把我给废...
Because that could really mess up my...

96
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,970
妈 给我午饭钱
Mom, I need money for lunch.

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,070
天啊
Oh, God.

98
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,210
抱歉 Chris
I'm sorry, Chris.

99
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,370
我的钱包已经丢了一天了
My purse has been missing for a day now.

100
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,710
我-我到处都找不到
I-I can't find it anywhere.

101
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
别担心 Lois
Not to worry, Lois.

102
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,910
Xerxes会找到它的
Xerxes will find it.

103
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,180
Xerxes去找Lois的钱包
Xerxes, find Lois's purse.

104
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,750
现在这是你的钱包了
This is your purse now.

105
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,020
Peter 我可不能把钱装这里面
Peter, I can't carry my money in this.

106
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,940
没错 "她的"钱
Yeah, her money.

107
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,410
你会爱上那公园的 Xerxes
You're gonna love the park, Xerxes.

108
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,850
我想你知道我想要什么
I think you know what I want.

109
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,050
太酷了
This is awesome.

110
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,920
我们应该有自己的电视剧
We should have our own TV show.

111
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,920
Peter与边斗猎鹰

112
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,420
那你觉得柏拉图式的淋浴怎么样
So what do you think about a platonic shower?

113
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,430
你是Peter Griffin么
Are you Peter Griffin?

114
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,400
我是
Yes, sir, I am.

115
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,800
我是你昨天盗窃的摩托车失主的代理人
I represent the man whose sidecar motorcycle you stole yesterday.

116
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,370
你激起了我的兴趣 继续说
You've piqued my interest, go on.

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,800
对你来说不幸的是 这人非常非常犹太
Unfortunately for you, that man is very, very Jewish

118
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,040
准备诉求你的一切财产
and is suing you for everything you've got.

119
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,520
包括这只隼
Including the falcon.

120
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,280
不 不要拿走Xerxes
No! Not Xerxes!

121
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,280
你逃不掉的
You won't get away with this.

122
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,480
等美航杂志知道这事你就完了
Wait till American Airlines' magazine hears about this!

123
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,170
你好 是美航杂志么
Hello, American Airlines' magazine?

124
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,310
我有个大料要爆给你们
Have I got a scoop for you.

125
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,160
"猎鹰被偷"
"Falcon stolen."

126
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,990
恶 这里面还有个脚指甲
Ew, there's a toenail in this.

127
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,880
我想我还是继续咳嗽算了
Guess I'll just go back to coughing.

128
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,610
现在我们该怎么办
Now what are we gonna do?

129
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,870
我们没钱了
We have no money.

130
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,480
没事儿 Lois 我们有一个美满的家庭
That's okay, Lois, we got a wonderful family.

131
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,610
才不
No, we don't.

132
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,400
我们有Meg 笨蛋和大头
There's Meg and Dummy and Big Head.

133
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,560
妈的 Peter
Damn it, Peter,

134
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,230
我不得不去找份工作了
I'm probably gonna have to get a job.

135
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,380
谢天谢地 我还以为自己得回
Oh, thank God. Thought I was gonna have to go back

136
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,320
那个"Kelly和Peter直播秀"呢
to being on Live with Kelly and Peter.

137
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,320
恶搞美国的一档早间新闻节目"Live! with Kelly and Michael"

138
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,110
嘉宾介绍自己时要保持张嘴微笑真是累死我也
So exhausting having to do that open-mouth smile while the guest does their bit.

139
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,840
今天和我们一起的是"傲骨贤妻"中的克里斯汀·芭伦斯基
We're here with The Good Wife's Christine Baranski.

140
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,840
CBS的一部政律剧 由其本人配音

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,310
我也很确定你知道我想让你怎么用它
And I'm pretty certain you know what I want you to do with it.

283
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,650
好了 你觉得你还能往嘴里塞东西么
Okay, you think you can fit anything else in your mouth?

284
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,150
- 不行 - 那好 现在我们开始往其他地方塞东西吧
- Mm-mm. - All right, so now let's start filling up some other places.

285
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,580
Peter 我今天工作了一整天
Peter, I've had a long day at work,

286
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,590
现在 我最不想的就是做爱了
and right now, sex is the last thing I want to think about.

287
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,640
搞毛啊 Lois
What the hell, Lois?

288
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,390
你永远都不会想再做了
You never want to do it no more.

289
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,790
如果我告诉你我憋了一大泡屎呢
What if I told you I'm holding in a very big dump?

290
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,750
Peter 你今晚就不能用袜子Lois解决么
Peter, can't you just use Sock Lois tonight?

291
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,370
不 袜子Lois对我来说已经不再真实了
No! Sock Lois doesn't feel authentic to me anymore.

292
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,810
嘿 Joe 你和Bonnie多久上次床?
Hey, Joe, how often do you have sex with Bonnie?

293
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,310
医保组织一年只替我付一次设备费用 为什么问这个
Well, my HMO only pays for the equipment once a year. Why?

294
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,650
Lois 现在几乎没有性趣了
Lois barely wants to do it no more.

295
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,010
我都快疯了
I'm going crazy here.

296
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,310
呃 我明白
Ugh. I hear you.

297
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,120
嘿 Quagmire 帮你自己一个忙:
Hey, Quagmire, do yourself a favor:

298
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,580
不要结婚
don't get married.

299
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,720
我就没这打算
I wasn't gonna.

300
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,150
好的 不要结
Good. Don't.

301
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,190
没这打算
I wasn't.

302
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,560
很好 不要结
Perfect. Don't.

303
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,330
Joe 你让我"不要结婚"的话对我完全没影响
Joe, you telling me not to has no effect on me whatsoever.

304
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,630
我就不打算结婚
I'm not gonna get married.

305
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,500
很好 不要结
Great. Don't.

306
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,710
说真的 各位 这个无性生活完全行不同
I mean it, you guys, this no-sex thing doesn't work.

307
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,050
我需要某种发泄
I need some kind of outlet.

308
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,420
知道么 Peter 我正好有你需要的东西
You know, Peter, I got just the thing for you.

309
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,290
我最近和一个新的色情电话妞通过话
There's this new phone sex chick I been calling,

310
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,740
她棒极了
and she is amazing.

311
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,410
天 我不知道 这算不算背叛Lois呢
Gee, I don't know. Isn't that cheating on Lois?

312
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,010
不 听着 这是在电话上的
No, look, it's over the phone.

313
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,110
有这么种说法:"电话不算打炮"
It's like they say: "Phonin' ain't bonin'."

314
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,180
好吧 那我想我该试试看
Yeah. Well, I guess I could try it.

315
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,310
相信我 Peter
Trust me, Peter.

316
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,880
嘿 我告诉你去看妇科专家没错吧 对不
Hey, I was right about telling you to go see the gynecologist, wasn't I?

317
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,670
请让我看些鲍鱼
I'd like to see some vaginas, please.

318
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,110
我们来这儿不就是为此么 进来吧
That's what we're here for. Come on in.

319
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,890
你好 帅哥
Hello there, handsome.

320

323
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,230
Night Shyamalan.

324
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,800
他们这样叫我是因为我那东西最后有一个大螺旋
They call me that 'cause I got a big twist at the end of my thing.

325
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,250
天啊
Oh, my God.

326
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,790
呃... 那个 你好 Peter
Um... well, hello, Peter.

327
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,720
我能为你做点什么
What can I do for you?

328
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,260
呃 你想看看我画的画么
Um, you want to see some pictures that I drew?

329
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,140
呃 好啊
Um, sure.

330
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,680
这是我骑在大象上
This is me on a elephant.

331
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,550
哇 画得很美
Wow. That's beautiful.

332
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,930
你是自己一个人画完的?
Did you draw that all by yourself?

333
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,930
没错
Uh-huh.

334
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,540
然后这张是我在月球上
And this is me on the moon.

335
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,970
我并没有真去那儿
I didn't really go there.

336
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,470
是在我的想象之中而已
It was just in my imagination,

337
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,570
所以我画了出来
so I drawed it.

338
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,910
哇 你真是有天赋呢
Wow, you're really talented.

339
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,580
知道么 你有一种东西 小雅
You know, there's something about you, Classy.

340
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,010
一种特殊的东西
Something special.

341
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,080
啊 你嘴真甜
Aw, that's very sweet.

342
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,350
我喜欢你的声音
I like your voice.

343
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,520
让我想听到更多你的声音
It makes me want to hear more of your voice.

344
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,090
嘿 你想看搞笑漫画么
Hey, you want to see a funny comic?

345
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,590
好啊
Sure.

346
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,890
苹果艾伦的疯狂冒险
"那是我"

347
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,890
[开心一笑]

348
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,890
某个早晨艾伦醒来发现
"我的朋友们都去哪儿了?"

349
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,590
"啊啊啊啊"

350
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,500
他吓坏了因为他的朋友都死在派里了
He's scared 'cause his friends got killed in the pie.

351
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,610
那么 Peter 你今天过得如何
So, Peter, how was your day?

352
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,950
呃 一般般吧
Eh, it was okay.

353
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,720
除了那个我当午饭的横滨牛肉饭
Except for that Yokohama beef bowl I tried for lunch.

354
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,850
没想象的好
Not sitting so well.

355
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,490
只是"一般"?
Just "okay"?

356
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,220
你今天没尝试什么新东西么
Didn't try anything new today?

357
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,920
没和什么有趣的人说话?
Talk to anyone interesting?

358
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,060
没有
No, not really.

359
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,930
噢 那碗牛肉饭把我吃坏了
Oh, that beef bowl is wrecking me.

360
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,560
我的胃感觉就像上次
My stomach feels like that time

361
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,260
我得了爆炸性腹泻一样
I had explosive diarrhea.

362
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,630
屎屋
Brown house.

363
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,630
"road house"经典段子

364
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,820
喂?
Hello?

365
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,320
呃 嗨 小雅
Um, hi, Classy.

366
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,530
是Peter
It's Peter.

367
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,010
噢 你好
Oh, hi there.

368
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,680
我喜欢你说话的样子
I love when you talk.

369
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,970
听着 呃 我这几次和你通话很开心
Listen, um, I've had such a good time talking to you these past few times

370
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,450
所以我想也许我们能见个面
that I was thinking maybe we could meet.

371
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,690
但是你结婚了啊
But you're married!

372
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,270
你有老婆
You've got a wife!

373
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,360
没错 但她最近对我总是很冷淡
Yeah, but she's been giving me the cold shoulder lately.

374
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,690
再说 就算发生了那种事
Besides, anything that comes out,

375
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,090
我总能回家后摆平她
I can always take home to her.

376
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,180
我觉得这不太好
I don't think this is a good idea.

377
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,580
我是说 欺骗你的妻子是很严重的
I mean, cheating on your wife is a very serious thing.

378
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,850
你不明白 我必须要见你
You don't understand, I have to meet you.

379
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,550
我-我知道有些唐突
I-I know it seems sudden,

380
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,990
但我感觉我们之间有种特殊的感觉
but I feel a special connection with you.

381
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,760
听着 告诉我地点时间
Look, you name the place and the time,

382
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,740
我会到的
and I'll be there.

383
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,810
你个贱货
You son of a bitch!

384
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,950
好的
Okay.

385
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,530
我会去见你的
I'll meet you.

386
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,600
吔 我成功了
Yay, I did it!

387
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,220
谢谢 仙女Peter
Thanks, Fairy God Peter!

388
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,440
Peter 力量一直与你同在
Peter, the power was within you all along.

389
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,190
现在如果你不介意 我要去和仙女Quagmire
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm meeting Fairy God Quagmire

390
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,610
还有仙女Joe在仙女醉蚌吧见面了
and Fairy God Joe down at the Fairy God Clam.

391
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,890
- 那听着像个基吧 - 那就是个基吧
- That sounds like a gay bar. - It is a gay bar.

392
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,420
没错 伙计们 我要见到她了
That's right, fellas, I'm gonna meet her.

393
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,420
见谁?
Meet who?

394
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,800
是啊 你在说什么呢
Yeah, what are you talking about?

395
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,500
哦 我以为我们从一半开始是节省时间呢
Oh, I-I thought we were starting in the middle to save time.

396
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,820
那个色情电话女郎
The-the phone sex lady,

397
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,620
我要见到那个色情电话女郎的真人了
I'm gonna meet the phone sex lady in person.

398
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,890
哇 哇 哇 等会儿 Peter
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, Peter.

399
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,060
是我就不会那么做
I wouldn't do that.

400
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,300
打住 Quagmire 你这主意可不好
Hang on, Quagmire, that's a bad idea.

401
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,200
你绝不想和那些色情电话女在现实中见面
You never want to meet those phone sex women in person.

402
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,720
是啊 我知道 我刚就这么说的
Yeah, I know, that's what I said.

403
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,720
是我就不会这么做
I wouldn't do it.

404
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,050
好的 不要
Good. Don't.

405
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,810
Joe Joe 你有没有发现你告诉我
Joe, Joe, you realize what you're telling me

406
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,970
不要去做某事 但我本来就不会做的
not to do, I'm already not doing!

407
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,740
我知道绝对不能和色情电话女见面
Okay, I know you should never meet a phone sex operator.

408
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,140
好吧? 我不是白痴
All right? I'm not an idiot.

409
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,850
我绝不会去见那种人的 绝不
I would never meet one of those people, ever.

410
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,500
好 不要
Good. Don't.

411
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,030

Guys, I have to see if she's as special in person

412
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,330
电话中一样很特别
as she is on the phone.

413
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,870
另外 如果我要是听你们的话
Besides, if I listened to you guys,

414
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,500
我就绝不会得到那个为婴儿替坐的工作了
I never would've got that job as a seat filler for fetuses.

415
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,910
好了 让我们来看看你的宝宝 好么
Okay, let's take a look at your baby, shall we?

416
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,460
嗨
Hi.

417
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,430
他一会就回来 去上厕所了
He'll be right back; he's in the bathroom.

There's a lot of crazy things I'll let Peter get away with.

432

他经历那段动漫时期时我都没说什么
I even held my tongue when he went through that anime phase.

你怎么穿成这样
Why are you dressed like that?

439
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,760

而且 万一你们好奇想知道
And in case you're wondering why

444
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,870
我为何没有业务报表的话 其实我有
I don't have business charts, yes, I do.

445
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,930
好了 我要和孩子们道别了
All right, I got to say good-bye to the kids.

我希望你能收下这怀表
I want you to have this pocket watch.

448
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,050
它还能走 就算它上面
It still works, even though it's got

449
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,820
沾满了内战时的脑浆也一样
a lot of Civil War brains all over it.

Chris 人们将会告诉你
Chris, people are gonna tell you

452
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,860
你是个笨蛋而且一无是处
that you're stupid and that you're no good.

453
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,860

你...
You're...

你真美
you're beautiful.

458

既然你非要见我不可
So you got to meet me.

459
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,140
我们要做还是怎么着
Are we gonna do this or what?

460
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,740
听着 我...我得向你坦白
Listen, I... I got to be honest with you.

461
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,350
我其实不是
I am not, in fact,

462
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,980
风火轮车模公司的总裁
the President of Hot Wheels.

463
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,050
还有关于那个大厨帽我也撒谎了
And I also lied about the giant chef's hat.

464
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,550
我一顶也没有
I do not have one.

465
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,690
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

466
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,320
小谎并不重要
Well, the small lies don't matter.

467
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
我们开始吧
Let's go.

468
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,460
我为什么要这么做
Why am I doing this?

469
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,680
知道么 我有这世上最好的妻子
You know, I got the greatest wife in the world.

470
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,600
我们还有一个美丽的孩子
And we have one beautiful child.

471
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,100
但你是否感觉过有什么东西缺失了呢
But did you ever feel like something was missing?

472
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,930
知道么 就是你曾经拥有过
You know, something you had once,

473
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,390
但是现在却失去的
but now it's gone?

474
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,040
你是说对某个你信任的人的忠诚么
You mean like the loyalty of someone you trusted?

475
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,010
是的 我完全明白那种感觉
Yes, I know exactly what that feels like.

476
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,910
是啊 我是说 我第一次打给你
Yeah, I mean, I was just goofing around

477
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,410
只是想瞎聊聊 但当我听到你的声音
when I first called you, but when I heard your voice,

478
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,580
我-我感觉我找到了我失落的那部分
I-I felt like I found some part of me that was lost.

479
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,880
完全说不通 但是...
Doesn't make any sense, but it...

480
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,840
感觉某种神秘的力量想让我们相遇
it felt like some force in the universe wanted us together.

481
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,840
这话... 挺中听的
That's... kind of nice.

482
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,940
我想我能理解
I guess I could understand that.

483
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,880
既然你现在就在我面前
Now that you're here in front of me,

484
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,680
我想你是我见过最美的女人
I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

485
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,190
八个**的(双关)小时之后
Eight (bleep) hours later...

486
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,250
啊 我必须要说 我太牛逼了
Ah, I got to say, I was fantastic.

487
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,520
你真这么想? 你这下贱的烂骗子
You think so, you dirty, rotten cheater?!

488
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,960
Lois!

489
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,860
你-你-你就是那个电话女郎
You-you-you-you is the phone lady,

490
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,290
你是那个电话 你是哪个电话
you the phone, you the phone,

491
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,760
你是那个电话女郎 你是那个电话女郎
you is the phone lady, you is the phone lady,

492
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,900
你是那个电话女郎...
you is the phone lady...

493
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,950
- 你欺骗了我 - Lois
- You cheated on me! - Lois!

494
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,730
你为什么会去做色情电话的工作
Why the hell were you doing phone sex?!

495
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,370
我是在养家糊口
I was providing for our family.

496
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,590
你在骗人
You were lying.

497
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,750
我开始觉得那整个芝加哥城
I'm starting to think that whole Chicago City

498
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,570
出差的故事真是一堆屁话
business trip was just a bunch of baloney!

499
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,840
这不是重点
That's not the point!

500
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,340
好吧 如果你想一想
Well, if you think about it,

501
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,860
我-我其实没有出轨因为是和你啊
I-I wasn't really cheating 'cause it was with you.

502
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,510
但你之前不知道是我啊
Well, you didn't know that!

503
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,110
是 但你知道么
Yeah, but you know what?

504
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,680
在某种意义上 我想我知道
In some way, I think I did.

505
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,550
其实 当我在电话上听到你的声音
You know, when I heard your voice on that phone,

506
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,820
我-我就有了种感觉
I-I felt something.

507
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,490
就像是本能 知道么
It was like an instinct, you know?

508
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,220
我的心和鸡鸡
Both my heart and my wiener

509
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,530
莫名的知道你就是我的灵魂伴侣
somehow knew you were my soul mate.

510
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,790
那个...
Well...

511
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,500
我想你一定爱煞我了
I suppose you did fall for me pretty hard.

512
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,570
你还不明白么 Lois
Don't you see, Lois?

513
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,900
我又爱上你了一遍
I fell in love with you all over again.

514
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,270
还有 听着 现在我们因为这事儿有了几年来最美妙的性爱
And, look, now we just had the best sex in years because of it.

515
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,440
我知道 就像我们的私处在沼泽中
I know. It's like our privates were shaking hands

516
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,080
成功商务会议后的握手一样
after a successful business meeting in a swamp.

517
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,080
对我来说 这... 这证明了
To me it... it just proves

518
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,410
我们是天生的一对
that we're truly meant to be together.

519
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,080
噢 我爱你 Peter
Oh, I love you, Peter.

520
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,950
我也爱你 Lois
I love you, too, Lois.

521
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,460
对了 你也许得成为一个全套都来的鸡了
By the way, you may have to become a full-on prostitute,

522
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,960
因为我们的电话账单是7000刀
'cause our phone bill was $7,000.

523
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,500
哦 Peter
Oh, Peter.

524
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,940
我想让你拼命的干我 这样我们就不得不换教堂了
I want you to do me so hard that we have to change churches.

525
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,090
恶心
Gross!

526
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,620
我太想蹂躏你了
I want to wreck you so bad,

527
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,280
你会被蹂躏成开垦过的热口袋牌卷饼一样
you'll look like an exploded Hot Pocket.

528
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,280
一种早餐品牌 类似卷饼 内有各种奶酪 蔬菜和肉等

529
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,740
天啊
Oh, my God!

530
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,720
你们有兴趣和我来个2又1/4P么
Can I interest you guys in a two-and-a-quarter way?
