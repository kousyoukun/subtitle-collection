12
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:41,829
Hi, there.

13
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:43,831
Hi. I'm Cindy.

14
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:45,133
The only way I
believe I'm pretty

15
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:46,718
is if strangers
have sex with me.

16
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:49,504
Well, maybe I could help fill
you up with self-confidence.

17
00:00:49,538 --> 00:00:50,772
Brian.

18
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:51,789
Hello there, sexy.

19
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:52,774
Hey, do you mind?

20
00:00:52,808 --> 00:00:54,042
We were having
a conversation.

21
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:57,629
My house has 8,000 square feet,
zero bookshelves.

22
00:00:57,663 --> 00:01:00,048
Wow, that's impressive.

23
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:01,933
I'm a writer,
published twice.

24
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:03,651
I own a cinder block yard.

25
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:05,903
Have over 12,000
cinder blocks.

26
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:08,740
If you ever need cinder block,
I can get you good price.

27
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:09,857
Thank you.

28
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:12,593
I-I have a six-CD changer,
so you can pretty much

29
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:14,979
fill the tray
and create a world.

30
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:16,314
Come have sex with me.

31
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:19,167
My mother will make you
farkshekoosh when we are done.

32
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:21,502
Okay.

33
00:01:21,553 --> 00:01:22,971
Wait!

34
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:25,289
I have a time machine.

35
00:01:25,324 --> 00:01:26,891
You do?

36
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:27,959
Yeah, you want to see it?

37
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:30,261
Yes, I want to see it!

38
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:31,562
Better luck next time, pal.

39
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:33,464
Some people got moves,
others don't.

40
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:34,632
Been that way forever.

41
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:35,616
You.

42
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:37,885
Me. Sex.

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,487
Him legend.

44
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,861
Shh.

45
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:50,248
Why do you keep a sleeping baby
in your time machine room?

46
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:52,834
I-I don't know,
my decorator's terrible.

47
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:08,433
Where are we?

48
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:11,586
Ford's Theater,
April 14, 1865.

49
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,538
Ooh, Valentine's Day.

50
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:15,039
How romantic.

51
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:18,009
Uh, yeah, sure,
you know me.

52
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,282
Oh, my God,
the president's been shot!

53
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:26,360
If you ask me, the
president's the lucky one.

54
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:26,871
How's that?

55
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:29,404
He doesn't have to sit
through the rest of the show.

56
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:42,567
Yes, I'd like
to return this printer.

57
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,474
<i>The frame is</i>
<i>crashing to the ground,</i>

58
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:51,726
<i>not quite to the mooring mast!</i>
<i>Oh, the humanity!</i>

59
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,361
<i>And all the passengers</i>
<i>screaming around here!</i>

60
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:55,747
<i>And just when you thought</i>
<i>it couldn't get any worse,</i>

61
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:57,982
<i>there's a dog having sex</i>
<i>with a woman!</i>

62
00:02:58,016 --> 00:03:00,435
<i>Oh, I know I said,</i>
<i>"Oh, the humanity!" before,</i>

63
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:02,837
<i>but seriously, oh, the humanity</i>
<i>even more right now!</i>

64
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:04,756
<i>I mean, come on!</i>

65
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:12,547
So that's what restaurants
were like before desegregation.

66
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,999
It was quiet.
It <i>was</i> quiet.

67
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:20,521
Wow, Brian,
you've had quite a string

68
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:22,590
of female guests
spend the night lately.

69
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:24,492
Yeah, whatever you're doing,
it's working.

70
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:26,594
You should see the way
<i>I</i> have to pick up chicks.

71
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:28,930
Hi.

72
00:03:35,504 --> 00:03:38,272
Well, I guess you can call
me the Man of La Muncha.

73
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:41,659
Hey, why does your
time machine have a sticker

74
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:43,628
that says
"property of Stewie Griffin?"

75
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:46,297
Uh, well, I-I...

76
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,367
All right, to be
completely honest,

77
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:51,486
and because we've already
had sex, it's not mine.

78
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,305
I use it all the time,
and the owner has no idea.

79
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:55,973
In fact, he'd
kill me if he knew.

80
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,092
Really? Won't he see that thing
on the control panel

81
00:03:58,127 --> 00:03:59,393
that says "years traveled"?

82
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:00,928
What thing?

83
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,033
Here's where Brian goes berserk.

84
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:22,517
Look, it's no big deal.

85
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:24,468
Just reverse it
and take off the miles.

86
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:27,137
That's what I do
when I take my dad's car out.

87
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:29,157
Are you... are you 16?

88
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:30,892
I will be next September.

89
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:32,326
Well, I think someone

90
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:35,730
has a Barnes & Noble gift card
coming for their silence.

91
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:01,272
Brian, what the hell
are you doing in here?

92
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,723
What's happening
to my time machine?

93
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:03,891
I-I don't know, man.

94
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:05,610
I-I saw Meg leaving
a minute ago,

95
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:07,128
going, "Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha,"
but I-I don't know.

96
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,045
Oh, my God, it's having
a complete meltdown!

97
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:43,881
What happened?

98
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,316
I don't know.

99
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:50,304
Dear God, my
time machine!

100
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:54,642
You, uh... you want
to tell me about this?

101
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,644
See? I told you.
It was Meg.

102
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:57,912
I don't think so.

103
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,847
The crotch doesn't
look like a BMX track.

104
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,816
You bastard! You've been
using my time machine

105
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,084
to nail your
bar skanks!

106
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:04,819
Oh, come on,
they're not all bad.

107
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:07,021
Oh, yes, I've seen the
women you bring home.

108
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:09,173
That stutterer?
She was a real prize.

109
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:11,075
How are you enjoying
your meal?

110
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:14,946
L-L-Lois, it's
d-d-d-delicious.

111
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,597
Oh, for crying out loud.

112
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:18,916
Peter, why are you turning up
the heat again?

113
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:21,435
Lois, this woman
is obviously freezing.

114
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,037
Brian, I want
you to tell me

115
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:24,872
exactly what you did
to my time machine.

116
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,725
Well, I didn't want you
to find out I'd been using it,

117
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,628
so I tried turning the
chronological gauge backward.

118
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:32,463
It's not designed to
go backward, Brian.

119
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:35,366
The question is, how
am I going to fix it?

120
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,768
What the hell?

121
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,415
Dear God,
everything's moving backward.

122
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,817
What? What are
you talking about?

123
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:54,752
I don't know
what the hell you did

124
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:56,220
with all your
messing around, Brian,

125
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:57,455
but somehow my machine seems

126
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,190
to have reversed
the direction of time.

127
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:00,758
Reversed the
direction of time?

128
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,259
Stewie, what does
that even mean?

129
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:03,577
I don't get it.

130
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:09,483
Oh, ok, now I get it.

131
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:23,928
Stewie, you can't just change
the direction of time.

132
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:25,060
H-How is this even possible?

133
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:26,311
Well, clearly,
when you attempted

134
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,229
to reverse the gauge
on my time machine,

135
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,482
you somehow released a quantum
shock wave powerful enough

136
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,901
to push the flow of time
in the opposite direction.

137
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:36,187
I can only surmise that you and
I were isolated from its effects

138
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,756
because we were inside
the machine

139
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,240
at the moment
of temporal inversion.

140
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,259
Are you...
are you sleeping?

141
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,361
Huh? No, no, I...
No, I was listening.

142
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,097
What kind of jerk alters time,
and then falls asleep?

143
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,217
Look, I'm sorry, Stewie,
but do you think you can fix it?

144
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,603
Well, it's gonna take a while
to rebuild the machine,

145
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,788
and even longer to
recalibrate it for normal time,

146
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:55,790
but I've taken on
bigger challenges before.

147
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:59,427
I had to explain to America why
Heidi Klum broke up with Seal.

148
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,696
Face.

149
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,683
There, now you've got
a fresh new diaper, Stewie.

150
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,335
What are you talking about?

151
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:09,020
What's going on?

152
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:12,090
I think you're getting
a diaper change.

153
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,559
Aah! Get that poop-filled thing
away from me!

154
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:17,612
No! Oh, God,
it's cold!

155
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:20,865
Whew! Smells like somebody
needs a diaper change.

156
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,066
Damn right I do!

157
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,635
Now, get this turd-filled
sack off...

158
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,204
Oh, my God,
it just went back in my body.

159
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,407
Hey, look, what's
wrong with Peter?

160
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,312
Oh, you smell that?
He's passed out drunk.

161
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,648
Does no one in this house
have any dignity?

162
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,019
Hey, Lois, I'm home from
the Clam, and I'm horny.

163
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:01,623
Hmm. Seems like reverse
time did that kid a favor.

164
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:03,424
I'm not so sure about that.

165
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:07,645
Stand up! You're gonna
break that thermometer!

166
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,287
My God, it's...
it's extraordinary.

167
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,689
They all seem to be

168
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,458
completely unaware
that anything is amiss.

169
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:33,822
"Your trash barrels
were a little close

170
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,157
"to our driveway. Joe.

171
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,059
"P.S. Please close
the windows

172
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:40,061
"when you're giving
piano lessons.

173
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,997
My legs don't work,
but my ears do."

174
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:47,602
Brian, what are you doing
staring in Quagmire's window?

175
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:50,471
Man, watching sex
in reverse is just bizarre.

176
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,985
God, where does Quagmire
meet these women?

177
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,758
This is why Boxbuster
went out of business.

178
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:12,710
Hey, what's going on
over there?

179
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,173
My God, look at all
this devastation!

180
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,274
What the hell happened?

181
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,511
Okay, Seamus, today's the day

182
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,447
you finally ask out
that barista.

183
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,349
What's the worst
that could happen?

184
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,035
You know, that chicken's kid
is in my preschool class.

185
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,903
I don't really want
to be friends with him,

186
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,338
but he knows a lot of chicks.

187
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,140
And backwards rim shot.

188
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,197
Oh, Brian, this is gonna be
more difficult than I thought.

189
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:58,232
Damn it, I hate
these new stairs!

190
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:05,873
What are you watching?

191
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:07,542
<i>Meet the Press;</i>
it's really weird.

192
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:10,378
In reverse time, the Republicans
make outrageous statements

193
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:13,114
and then the host asks
an unrelated question.

194
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:14,983
Global warming is a myth.

195
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:18,186
God created everything, and
the world is getting colder!

196
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,755
What is your tax plan?

197
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:21,889
That's odd.

198
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:22,991
What?

199
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:28,212
Man, we got a large number
of clovers on our lawn.

200
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,016
No, no, no, no, no, no!

201
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:33,835
Oh, hey, Cleveland.

202
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,724
Australia, here I come.

203
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,025
Look at that, Brian.

204
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,044
Cleveland is back living
across the street.

205
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,013
Cleveland left Quahog
quite some time ago,

206
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:47,415
yet we only just recently
entered reverse time.

207
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:48,900
So what does that mean?

208
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,903
Well, it suggests that time may
not simply be flowing backwards;

209
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,821
it may, in fact,
be accelerating.

210
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,623
Accelerating?
Why would that be happening?

211
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:56,758
I'm not sure.

212
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,026
Have you ever heard
of a phenomenon

213
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,594
called time dilation, Brian?

214
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:00,661
Sure.
No, you haven't.

215
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,430
Time dilation,
in forward time,

216
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:04,332
is a phenomenon caused
by a variety of factors

217
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,567
in which time
moves more slowly.

218
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:08,536
In reverse time,
it stands to reason

219
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,905
that the same phenomenon would
cause time to accelerate.

220
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:13,007
I'll have to consult
my quantum calculations

221
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,510
to try to isolate the
factors responsible.

222
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:20,932
What the hell was that?

223
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,834
This is more intense
than when I fought a rabbit

224
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,268
in that karate tournament.

225
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,104
That's weird. You're doing
reverse cutaways now?

226
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,189
What the hell is...
What? What's the matter?

227
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,545
Dear God, I'm un-teething.

228
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,764
Brian, it appears the
flow of reverse time

229
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,433
is beginning to
affect us as well.

230
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:39,967
What does that mean?

231
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:42,336
It means I'm going to have
to relive everything.

232
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:44,405
Every painful,
awkward moment.

233
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,474
Like that time I forgot
what came after "G"

234
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:47,842
and had to fake it.

235

00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:14,869
It's Peter and Chris.

243
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:16,637
Sounds like they're
in trouble.

244
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:22,376
My God, why is there
vomit everywhere?

245
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:23,928
Is that the Ipecac bottle?

Oh, no.

00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:32,153
Oh, dear God...

251
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,690
Aah! What the hell?

I don't wanna!

00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,135
Oh, God, this is so disgusting.

255
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:49,720
I think I'm gonna puke.

256
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,429
Stewie, I don't care
what it takes.

257
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:00,531
We have got to fix this.

258
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,134
We just ate so much vomit.

259
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,369
Brian, it gets worse.

260
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,473
Look.

261
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,475
Yeah, Bonnie's pregnant
with Susie. So?

262
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,744
That means Susie's
been un-born.

263
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,379
Oh, my God.

264
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,298
Stewie, you're not
that much older than Susie.

265
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,300
Brian, if we don't find a way

266
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,968
to push time forward again soon,

267
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,388
I, too, shall be un-born.

268

That guy's gonna feel
so much better

271
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,539
after we do what we got planned.

272
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:50,561
How much time do we have
before you're un-born?

273
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,880
With the time acceleration,
I'm not quite sure.

274
00:15:52,914 --> 00:15:55,315
But trust me, I can feel
myself getting younger.

275
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,000
All right.

276
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:58,285
The machine has
been repaired.

277
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:00,370
Now all I've got to do
is isolate the cause

278
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:01,471
of the acceleration curve

279
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:03,540
and see if I can
duplicate the shock wave.

280
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:05,943
What's the matter?

281
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:08,545
I've regressed to my
pre-ambulatory stage.

282
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,264
I can no longer walk!

283
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,918
My God, Stew,
you look terrible.

284
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,687
Brian, I suddenly feel as if

285
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:19,756
I've just been through
some sort of major trauma.

286
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,859
Uh-oh. I think I know
what that major trauma was.

287
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:24,828
My birth.

288
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:26,663
Dear God, I've got
to get out of here!

289
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,555
Oh, he's so cute.

290
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:36,557
Oh, my God, we're getting
closer to the beginning.

291
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:38,258
You're Lacey Chabert.

292
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:39,793
Oh, boy, a baby.

293
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:42,663
I saw my Spanish teacher
leave one of you in a trash can.

294
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,131
Brian, help!

295
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:45,732
Stewie, what do I do?

296
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:48,151
He's gorgeous, isn't he?

297
00:16:48,186 --> 00:16:50,203
I want to be the baby!

298
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:51,705
Look at that head.

299
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:53,407
Well, Lois,
this kind of completes

300
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:55,375
your little carnival here.

301
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,510
Hey, little guy.

302
00:16:56,544 --> 00:16:58,378
You ever need white,
corner-of-the-mouth stuff,

303
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,564
you come to your grandpa.

304
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:03,700
Stewie, this is
your new home.

305
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:05,152
Brian, help!
It's up to you.

306
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,804
You've got to restore
the flow of time.

307
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:10,307
My life depends on it!

308
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,810
What? Stewie, I don't know
how to fix that machine.

309
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:15,162
Trust me, you can do it.

310
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,281
You're so talented
in so many ways.

311
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:18,282
Like what?

312
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:19,783
Like... You...

313
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:21,451
Just write down however
you think you're talented,

314
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:23,220
and I'll sign it.

315
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:26,740
Well, it's up to you, buddy.

316
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:28,909
Save this marriage.

317
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:37,651
Oh, my God,
it's the greased-up deaf guy

318
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:40,253
running backwards toward
that grease truck explosion.

319
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:42,356
Oh, the grease burns so bad!

320
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,091
I can't hear!

321
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,078
Boy, I am late for that meeting.

322
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:54,568
Come on, math, you dick.

323
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,240
Come on, Brian.

324
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,231
All right, think, think.

325
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:10,133
What do I do? What do I do?

326
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:12,302
All right, could it be
as simple as this?

327
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:13,720
"Invert time flow."

328
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:16,390
Ah-ah-ah.

329
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:17,574
Ah-ah-ah.

330
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:18,925
Ah-ah-ah.

331
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,596
Oh, he's perfect.

332
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:25,615
11:34 a.m.

333
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,250
Come on, Brian, hurry.

334
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:30,187
It's a girl!

335
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:31,972
With a penis and no vagina.

336
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:37,594
No...!

337
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:39,196
I think I can hear the ocean.

338
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,864
Smell it, too.

339
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:42,199
All right, what do I do?

340
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,451
Wait a minute,
what did I do before?

341
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:45,969
That's all I have to do, right,

342
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:48,889
is duplicate the circumstances,
but do it the opposite way.

343
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:50,707
All right,
I was standing right here,

344
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:53,944
the machine was on,
I broke the glass...

345
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:56,113
and I turned the gauge backward.

346
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:58,615
Maybe if I turn it
in the other direction.

347
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:25,092
Ooh, a quarter.

348
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:27,494
Who cares what that doctor found
on my nuts?

349
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,579
This is a good day.

350
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:30,747
It worked.

351
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:32,516
I don't believe it. It worked.

352
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:38,905
Brian, there you are.

353
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,140
Where have you been?

354
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:41,441
Meg, where's Stewie?

355
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:43,176
Stewie? Who's Stewie?

356
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:44,644
Here it comes.
Push, Mrs. Griffin.

357
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:47,464
You know what?

358
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:50,267
I take it back, those panties
are gonna be in the way.

359
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,035
Okay, here comes the baby.

360
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:55,205
Bloody hell!

361
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,373
It's a boy.

362
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,592
Oh, thank God.

363
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,094
Oh, he's so beautiful.

364
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:03,213
Mrs. Griffin, your husband's
standing right here.

365
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:05,515
What should we name him?

366
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,335
I kind of like
Brian's name: Stewie.

367
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,337
That's a wonderful name, Brian.

368
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:11,571
Stewie.

369
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:13,523
Hi, Stewie.

370
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:15,041
You did it, Brian.
I've got to say,

371
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:17,260
I didn't think you were
gonna be able to pull it off,

372
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:18,545
but you did it.

373
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:20,630
You saved my life.

374
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:23,467
And for that,
I shall be forever grateful.

375
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:26,770
Hey, I couldn't imagine life
without you, buddy.

376
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:29,940
You know, I forgot what a
man cave I had in Lois's uterus.

377
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:32,025
While I was waiting for
you, I was shooting pool.

378
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:35,128
Had to hold the cue at
weird angles, but still.

379
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:41,601
Oh, Peter, isn't he amazing?

380
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:44,671
Is he smart, or is he...
like me?

381
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:46,706
He's perfect.

382
