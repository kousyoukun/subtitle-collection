Lois, this woman is obviously freezing.

Brian, I want you to tell me
exactly what you did to my time machine.

112
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,562
Well, I didn't want you
to find out I'd been using it,

113
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,792
so I tried turning the
chronological gauge backward.

114
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,298
It's not designed to go backward, Brian.

I don't know what the hell you did
with all your messing around, Brian,

120
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,584
but somehow my machine seems
to have reversed the direction of time.

121
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,595
Reversed the direction of time?

122
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,688
Stewie, what does that even mean?
I don't get it.

123
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,870
Okay, now I get it.

124
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,784
Stewie, you can't just
change the direction of time.

125
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,945
How is this even possible?

126
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,953
Well, clearly, when you attempted
to reverse the gauge on my time machine,

127
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,026
you somehow released
a quantum shock wave

128
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,994
powerful enough to push the flow of time
in the opposite direction.

129
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,995
I can only surmise that you and I
were isolated from its effects

130
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,068
because we were inside the machine
at the moment of temporal inversion.

131
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,766
Are you sleeping?

132
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,362
Huh? No, no. No, I was listening.

133
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,341
What kind of jerk alters time,
and then falls asleep?

134
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,139
Look, I'm sorry, Stewie,
but do you think you can fix it?

135
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,144
Well, it's gonna take a while
to rebuild the machine,

136
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,842
and even longer to
recalibrate it for normal time,

137
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,974
but I've taken on bigger challenges before.

138
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,316

why Heidi Klum broke up with Seal.

140
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,819
There, now you've got
a fresh new diaper, Stewie.

141
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,292
What are you talking about?

142
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,958
What's going on?

143
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,861
I think you're getting a diaper change.

Ah! Get that poop-filled thing
away from me.

Damn right I do!
Now, get this turd-filled sack off...

Global warming is a myth.

Australia, here I come.

193
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,098
Look at that, Brian.
Cleveland is back living across the street.

194
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,208
Cleveland left Quahog quite some time ago,

195
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,572
yet we only just recently
entered reverse time.

196
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,803
So what does that mean?

197
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,073
Well, it suggests that time may
not simply be flowing backwards,

198
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,716
it may, in fact, be accelerating.

199
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,509
Accelerating?
Why would that be happening?

200
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:55,651
I'm not sure.

201
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,619
Have you ever heard of a phenomenon
called time dilation, Brian?

202
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,689
- Sure.
- No, you haven't.

203
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,281
Time dilation, in forward time,

204
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,587
is a phenomenon caused
by a variety of factors

205
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,821
in which time moves more slowly.

206
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,521
In reverse time, it stands to reason

207
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,157
that the same phenomenon would
cause time to accelerate.

208
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,096
I'll have to consult
my quantum calculations

209
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,397
to try to isolate the factors responsible.

210
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,901
What the hell was that?

211
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,706
This is more intense
than when I fought a rabbit

212
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,041
in that karate tournament.

213
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,115
That's weird.

Dear God, I'm un-teething.

216
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,727
Brian, it appears the flow of reverse time
is beginning to affect us as well.

217

What does that mean?

218
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,422
It means I'm going to have

With a penis and no vagina.

315
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,024
No!

316
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,386
I think I can hear the ocean.

317
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,655
Smell it, too.

318
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,554
All right, what do I do?

319
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,960
Wait a minute, what did I do before?

320
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,091
That's all I have to do, right,

321
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,034
is duplicate the circumstances,
but do it the opposite way.

322
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,831
All right, I was standing right here,

323
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,841
the machine was on, I broke the glass...

324
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,808
And I turned the gauge backward.

325
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,202
Maybe if I turn it in the other direction.

326
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,966
Ooh, a quarter.

327
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,372
Who cares what that doctor found
on my nuts?

328
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,773
This is a good day.

329
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,570
It worked.

330
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,237
I don't believe it. It worked.

331
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,149
Brian, there you are. Where have you been?

332
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,450
Meg, where's Stewie?

333
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:41,989
Stewie? Who's Stewie?

334
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,920
Here it comes. Push, Mrs. Griffin.

335
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,627
(GRUNTS)

336
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,060
You know what? I take it back,
those panties are gonna be in the way.

337
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,928
Okay, here comes the baby.

338
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,932
Bloody hell!

339
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,733
- It's a boy.
- (ALL CHEER)

340
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,201
Oh, thank God.

341
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,904
He's so beautiful.

342
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,601
Mrs. Griffin, your husband's
standing right here.

343
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,276
What should we name him?

344
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,144
I kind of like Brian's name. Stewie.

345
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,479
That's a wonderful name, Brian.

346
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,283
Stewie. Hi, Stewie.

347
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,548
You did it, Brian. I've got to say,

348
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,023
I didn't think you were
gonna be able to pull it off,

349
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,593
but you did it.

350
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,387
You saved my life.

351
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,962
And for that, I shall be forever grateful.

352
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,467
Hey, I couldn't imagine life
without you, buddy.

353
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,972
You know, I forgot what
a man cave I had in Lois' uterus.

354
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,096
While I was waiting for you,
I was shooting pool.

355
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,767
Had to hold the cue
at weird angles, but still.

356
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,172
Oh, Peter, isn't he amazing?

357
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,848
Is he smart, or is he like me?

358
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,386
He's perfect.

359
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,922
<i>CHRIS: You guys heard the baby
talking in there, din't you?</i>

360
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,591
<i>LOIS: Chris, that's ridiculous.</i>
