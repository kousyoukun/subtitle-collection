12
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:37,024
All right, Drunken
Clammers, this is it,

13
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:38,825
the most important
game of the season.

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,261
Now, is everybody drunk?
(others react affirmatively)

15
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:42,729
Completely.
Okay, good.

16
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:45,532
And did nobody warm up?
(others react affirmatively)

17
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,368
Good. 'Cause there's nothing
an unstretched middle-aged body

18
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:50,187
likes more than
explosive movements.

19
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:52,172
Now remember, we're here
to impress the girlfriends

20
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:53,523
of guys we barely know,

21
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:55,676
so when you get the ball,
throw it like a cannon.

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,028
You must throw your arm out
on every play.

23
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:00,030
Any other softball-related
questions?

24
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:01,148
Yeah, I got a question:

25
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:02,983
Can we leave
our bad-for-the-environment

26
00:01:03,017 --> 00:01:05,352
Styrofoam coolers behind
when we leave?

27
00:01:05,386 --> 00:01:06,687
Yes, you must
leave them behind,

28
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,422
and they must be
in a crumbly mess

29
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:10,357
so that the city clean-up
workers have to chase

30
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:12,242
the little bits
when the wind blows.

31
00:01:12,276 --> 00:01:13,827
You know, Stewie, this is
actually a good park.

32
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,712
I've found a lot
of old tennis balls here.

33
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:17,180
Eh, I don't care
for this place.

34
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:18,448
Last time I was here,

35
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:21,084
I accidentally walked
into a Spanish picnic.

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,421
Excuse me, has anyone seen
a toy car around here?

37
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:26,089
Ooh. <i>Es</i> baby.

38
00:01:26,124 --> 00:01:27,841
I make beautiful.

39
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,126
(clippers buzzing)

40
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:36,933
Don't get any ideas
about Julio.

41
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:38,935
I'm his number one.

42
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,438
Here comes
Goldman's Pharmacy.

43
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,374
Hey, Goldman's Pharmacy!

44
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,893
Can you fill out a prescription
for us for diarrhea?

45
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:48,478
We're about to get the runs!

46
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:50,764
(others laugh)

47
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:52,365
Oh, yeah?
Well, speaking of things

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,867
that are brown and can run,

49
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:55,802
meet our new teammate!

50
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:00,157
Holy crap.
They got a ringer.

51
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:02,159
What the hell?
Jerome's on your team?

52
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:04,027
That's right.
We got to know each other

53
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:06,363
while I was following
him around my store.

54
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:08,365
What's up, fools?
I'd like to dedicate

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,268
my performance today
to Miss Whitney Houston.

56
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:13,303
Oh, we are (bleep).

57
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,308
Come on, Jerome!

58
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:20,077
Get a hit so I can bring

59
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:21,845
a sports trophy home
for my parents!

60
00:02:21,847 --> 00:02:24,714
Jeffrey Lipsitz
has two soccerals!ed

61
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:27,584
I can't play soccer--
I have newborn-calf ankles!

62
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:29,603
You know this, damn it!

63
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:32,973
I'm gonna tear the cover
off this ball.

64
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:36,026
But, hang on, first I got
to adjust myself.

65
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,700
Are you having
a nice morning, dear?

66
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:47,003
Oh, yes, I love living here,
in the next town over.

67
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:51,875
All right, chick batter!

68
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:52,859
Everyone bring it in!

69
00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:53,910
Bring it on in!

70
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:55,212
Get a hit, babe!

71
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:57,531
(deep voice):
You know it, babe.

72
00:02:57,565 --> 00:03:00,383
All right, move it back!
Move it back!

73
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:04,204
Peter, why do you look
so nervous?

74
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:07,874
I promised a kid in the hospital
I'd hit a home run for him.

75
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:12,929
Sorry, I struck
out looking.

76
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:14,931
Wait, you're not
the kid I promised.

77
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,867
No, he died last night.

78
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,552
Oh, phew.

79
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,107
All right, guys, one more out
and the game is ours.

80
00:03:24,142 --> 00:03:25,675
Come on, Horace!
Strike him out!

81
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:34,067
(crowd gasps)

82
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:35,685
(gasps)

83
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:41,858
Horace! You okay?

84
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:42,909
Oh, my God!
He's really hurt bad!

85
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:44,127
You're out of the baseline,
by the way.

86
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:45,245
You're out. Game's over.

87
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,514
But, oh, my God,
Horace is really hurt.

88
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,033
He's dead.

89
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,735
(all gasp, murmur)

90
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:54,204
Let him rest in peace.

91
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,391
(sighs) Let's put
some leaves on him

92
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:00,260
and go get some ice cream.

93
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:08,702
I can't believe Horace is dead.

94
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:12,272
I can't believe we left Brian
in the car with the windows up.

95
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:15,275
I'm gonna pee!

96
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:17,944
Listen, I just
feel awful about this.

97
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:20,480
Horace was a good bartender
and a good guy.

98
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:22,499
I wish there was something
I could do.

99
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:24,467
Well, we know you
didn't mean it, Jerome.

100
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:26,069
It's just a
terrible situation.

101
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:28,021
Like when you're the
only one at the table

102
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:29,956
where the waiter doesn't
say, "Good order."

103
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:32,292
I'll have the halibut.
Ah, great choice.

104
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:34,461
One of the chef's specialties;
you'll love it.

105
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:36,963
It was caught fresh less
than ten miles from here.

106
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:38,632
I'll have the New York
strip steak.

107
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,700
Mmm! My absolute
favorite dish here.

108
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:43,370
It is a spectacular cut,
superbly seasoned

109
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:46,206
and the marbling is some
of the best I've ever seen.

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,474
And I'll have
the chicken.

111
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:49,009
Mm-hmm.

112
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,178
Good afternoon.

113
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:53,847
I'd just like to say that...

114
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:56,683
before today, I didn't know
the Munsters were driving around

115
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:58,184
in a funeral car.

116
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:00,587
I'm beginning to think
everything on that show

117
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:02,622
was a big joke.

118
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:06,192
(inhales deeply)

119
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:09,362
(voice quavering):
I'd, um... I'd just like...

120
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:11,731
(gasps)

121
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:13,767
Whe... When you lose...

122
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,702
(stifled sobs)

123
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:17,704
(sniffles, exhales)

124
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:20,840
(high-pitched): Um, there's
so... There's so mu...

125
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,576
(exhales)
There's so much...

126
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:26,997
(grunts)

127
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:30,000
I... I...

128
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:31,668
(sobbing)

129
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:33,336
Thank you, Quagmire.

130
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:36,973
Perhaps there are some <i>men</i> who
would like to say a few words.

131
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:39,976
Horace owned the Clam
for over 30 years.

132
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:42,946
During that time,
he touched all of our lives.

133
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,615
He was a great bartender
and a great friend.

134
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,134
And so let us take
a look back on his life

135
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,020
through this video
commemorating all the DUI's

136
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:53,406
that he was responsible for.

137
00:05:56,177 --> 00:06:03,216
♪ I will remember you

138
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,506
♪ Will you remember me?

139
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,226
♪ Don't let your life

140
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,595
♪ Pass you by

141
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:17,731
E.T.:
Ouch.

142
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:19,899
Is there a bathroom in here?

143
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:23,486
I've been yo-yoing a turd
for the last 20 minutes.

144
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,160
(gasps)
Oh, sorry.

145
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:31,561
I was looking
for the bathroom.

146
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:33,396
I shouldn't have left
the door open.

147
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:35,131
Sorry if you're grossed out
by this.

148
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,566
No. No, no, I'm just...

149
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,370
not used to seeing corpses
that big and not in a toilet.

150
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:42,539
Oh, here, let me
help you with that.

151
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,541
(grunts)

152
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:45,925
There you go.

153
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,844
Now you're all set
for your big day.

154
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:50,997
Thanks. You know, I could use
some part-time help here

155
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:52,832
preparing the bodies,
if you're interested.

156
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,834
Really? Yeah,
that'd-that'd be great.

157
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:56,069
I could use the money,

158
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:58,421
and I'm getting kind of
tired of my old job.

159
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:01,057
ANNOUNCER: Only a half a point divides
our top two competitors

160
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:03,960
as we enter the last event,
the Meg Roll.

161
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,982
You think it's cool
to go drinking

162
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:10,200
right after Horace's funeral?

163
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:12,369
Of course. It's what
he would've wanted.

164
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:13,953
Listen, we all
got to move on.

165
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:17,957
Like the Secret Service did
on November 23, 1963.

166
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:19,809
All right, guys,
I know that yesterday

167
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,144
was a rough one for us.

168
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:22,445
But it's with great pride

169
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,048
that I'm gonna turn this zero
into a one.

170
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:26,249
All right!

171
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:28,334
Nichols, you should
go home and change.

172
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:32,038
What the hell?
Hey, pal, what're you doing?

173
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:33,039
This is our bar.

174
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:34,140
Not anymore.

175
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:35,975
Horace owed more
than this place is worth,

176
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,510
so it's the bank's now.

177
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:40,513
I'm sorry but The Drunken Clam
is permanently closed.

178
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:41,815
Closed?!

179
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,817
PETER: <i>That was the start</i>
<i>of the dark times.</i>

180
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:47,604
<i>The banks took our bars, our</i>
<i>businesses and then our homes.</i>

181
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,105
<i>A change had to be made.</i>

182
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,608
<i>A change only one man</i>
<i>could make.</i>

183
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:53,626
<i>I am the Wind Maker...</i>

184
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:56,496
<i>...and I shoot monkeys now.</i>

185
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,296
ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>
<i>to</i> Joanie Loves Chris Brown.

186
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,297
(indistinct chatter)

187
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:08,965
Joanie! Chris!

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,518
Welcome to the party.
Can I offer you some punch?

189
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,853
No, thanks. I had
some in the car.

190
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:15,889
ANNOUNCER: Joanie Loves
Chris Brown <i>was taped in front</i>

191
00:08:15,923 --> 00:08:18,124
<i>of a very uncomfortable</i>
<i>studio audience.</i>

192
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,627
Man, it really sucks
they closed down the Clam.

193
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:22,195
Yeah, but I... I mean,
this is good, right?

194
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,614
I mean, as long as we got a
place to drink and a restroom

195
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:26,950
for businessmen to have
homosexual encounters.

196
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:28,335
Hey, thanks for the sex.

197
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:31,371
Thank you for notarizing
those documents.

198
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:33,390
Peter, what's
going on down here?

199
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:35,492
Why are there beer bottles
all over the floor?

200
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:37,560
Well, we needed a new spot
to drink, Lois.

201
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:38,979
Forget it, Peter.

202
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:40,547
You're not turning our
living room into a bar.

203
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,899
Oh, come on, Lois, we got
to have a place to drink.

204
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,050
Drinking is the only thing

205
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:45,185
holding this friendship
together.

206
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:48,054
Everything we try to do sober
just ends badly.

207
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,057
I just don't think a good way
to start a screenplay is,

208
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,727
"400 years ago
in Bethesda, Maryland."

209
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:55,962
Yeah, and don't you think it's
confusing that every character

210
00:08:55,997 --> 00:08:58,481
in the movie is named Movie Guy?
Come on, you guys.

211
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:00,800
The Oscars are next week,
so let's get this done.

212
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,274
Meg, I'm needed upstairs,
so I'll let you finish up.

213
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:10,010
Just put some blush
here and here.

214
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:13,363
It makes the eyes look
a little less dead and hollow.

215
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:15,181
Wow, that really works.

216
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:17,584
Hmm. Maybe I'll try
that on myself.

217
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:21,955
Oh, uh... you have what we call
a "closed casket face."

218
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,141
Hey, Meg,
who's your date?

219
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:27,610
He looks like a real stiff.
(laughs)

220
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:29,679
Chris, what the hell
are you doing here?

221
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:31,681
I told you not to
bother me at work.

222
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:34,317
I got locked out of the house,
and I need your key.

223
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:38,321
No way! You get to work
with all these dead people?

224
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:40,690
Hey, look,
this guy's picking his nose.

225
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:41,925
(laughs)

226
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,276
Look, now he's eating it!

227
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:44,644
Chris! Knock it off!

228
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:46,413
You're gonna get me
in trouble!

229
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:47,731
Meg, they're dead.

230
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,566
Would you stop being so uptight?

231
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,301
You're like one
of those Asian-Americans

232
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:52,969
who fought in Vietnam.

233
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,304
(shouts)

234
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:56,306
Oh, it's just me.

235
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:02,095
Peter, I thought you were taking
us to a new drinking spot.

236
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:03,797
What are we doing at the Clam?
Look, guys,

237
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:06,249
we tried other bars,
we tried drinking at home,

238
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:07,817
we even tried the big
end-of-the-year

239
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:10,220
high school party
that will change everything.

240
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:11,888
If we don't lose our
virginity tonight,

241
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:13,556
we're never gonna
make it in college!

242
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:14,991
Hey, where's Peter?

243
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:18,244
Only talking to Amanda Small,
the hottest girl in school.

244
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,413
But aren't you going out
with Joanne Fuller?

245
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:23,349
JoJo? No, she's my neighbor.
I've known her forever.

246
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:24,918
She works at her dad's garage.

247
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:26,419
She's practically a guy.

248
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:28,655
(gasps)
JoJo?!

249
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:31,491
♪ Looking from
a window above... ♪

250
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,009
Hi, Peter.

251
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:35,945
But I thought you was workin'
on your garbage sculpture.

252
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,681
There was someone
I had to see first.

253
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:41,017
Sorry, Amanda.
By the law of '80s movies,

254
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:42,786
a newly transformed tomboy

255
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,455

long-standing hotness.

Let's face it-- there's only
one drinking spot for us,

260
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,453
and it's the Clam.
But, Peter, it's closed.

261
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:01,654
We can't go in there.

262
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:03,369
Quagmire, when a girl
says she doesn't want

263
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,909
to have sex with you,
do you take that as an answer?

264
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:09,829
My lawyer has advised me
not to answer that question.

265
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,198
Look, I bet you could squeeze
through that window.

266
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:14,100
(garbage can clatters)

267
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:15,235
(window creaks)

268
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:16,369
It's not even locked.

269
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:18,204
And all the booze
is still in there.

270
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,906
Come on, guys,
this is trespassing

271
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,174
and it's against the law.

272
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,109
Maybe we should
just let the Clam go

273
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:24,544
and, I don't know,
spend more time

274
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:25,545
with our families.

275
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:26,546
Yeah, I tried that.

276
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,148
I just spend most of the time

277
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:30,150
testing Chris to see
if he's autistic.

278
00:11:32,086 --> 00:11:33,052
(screams):
No!

279
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:34,387
(groaning, whimpering)

280
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:36,673
Not overly affectionate.

281
00:11:36,707 --> 00:11:39,075
Guys, this is where we belong.

282
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:40,844
Yeah, no question
about that.

283
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:42,011
Yeah, we got roots here.

284
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:44,013
We've been coming
to this place for 15 years.

285
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:45,598
Our roots go back
further than that.

286
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,100
My grandfather
used to bring me here

287
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:48,268
when I was a kid.

288
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:50,136
And his grandfather
brought him here.

289
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,559
Good day, gentlemen!

290
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:57,877
Welcome to the Drunken Clam!

291
00:11:57,912 --> 00:11:59,913
Can I get you boys
a mug of stout?

292
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:01,147
Why, certainly.

293
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:02,749
This is a bully establishment
you've got here.

294
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:03,943
The doors are a little short,

295
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:04,934
but that's okay,

296
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:07,036
because we're smaller back now.

297
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:09,756
To the Clam!

298
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,040
ALL:
Hear, hear!

299
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:13,877
And to brain-damaging
venereal disease.

300
00:12:13,911 --> 00:12:15,962
I wake up with blood
on my penis pillow.

301
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:16,963
I'm gonna go insane

302
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:19,232
in a wheelchair,
staring at the sea.

303
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:24,337
(slurring):
This is everything about..

304
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,772
if it's the Clam, I love it.

305
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:26,940
(sighs)

306
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:28,541
(slurring): I was just
gonna... that's exactly.

307
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:30,343
Hey, uh, remember...
remember-remember when...

308
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:34,314
remember when... remember
when Quicktime here

309
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:36,432
passed out in this...
in this booth...

310
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,501
this booth,
and we did stuff to him

311
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:41,454
that you do to ladies
and we-we promised

312
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:42,722
we'd never tell you.

313
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:43,890
Wha...?

314
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:45,291
To the Clam!

315
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:49,746
Joe, you-- wha...
your hair looks stupid.

316
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,347
All... all the greatest...

317
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:53,116
all the greatest
moments of my life,

318
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,952
I spent right here
in-in this booth.

319
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,554
Maggie's first word.

320
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:59,656
Bart jumping that canyon.

321
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,790
Mr. Plow.

322
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:03,026
All the greatest
moments of my life.

323
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,978
Why is... why is Label Guy

324
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,779
trying to punch me?

325
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:09,916
(grumbles)
Punch you first, Label Guy.

326
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,100
I got to go pee.

327
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,936
(mumbles):
I don't want to get up.

328
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,470
Joe, where's the... that thing?

329
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,406
Where's the thing?
Where's the catheter thing?

330
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,874
No, it's mine,
it's private.

331
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:20,243
Hey, what happens
if I blow in this end?

332
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:21,611
Don't, I'll 'splode.

333
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:23,513
I'm gonna.

334
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:28,084
You do it better
than Bonnie.

335
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:31,471
It takes a man
to know what a man likes.

336
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:37,810
Meg, the Dougan family
called and they now want

337
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:40,113
Mr. Dougan in a gray suit
for the wake tomorrow.

338
00:13:40,147 --> 00:13:41,547
'Cause it <i>so</i> matters.

339
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:43,016
Could you change
his suit, please?

340
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,985
Sure.
I'll be back in a bit.

341
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:48,237
(casket lid creaks)

342
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:51,541
Oh... my... God!

343
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:53,509
All right, Chris,
where is it?

344
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:55,178
And don't try to act like

345
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,779
you don't know what
I'm talking about.

346
00:13:56,814 --> 00:13:58,448
Fine, you caught me.

347
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:00,249
So I borrowed your bra.

348
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:02,802
My boobs hurt when I
go down the stairs!

349
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,203
No, not that, you idiot.

350
00:14:04,238 --> 00:14:05,738
Where is the dead body?

351
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,273
I know you took it.

352
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:09,142
And don't lie, or I'll
tell Jennifer Connelly

353
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:10,816
that you're the one
who's been mailing her

354
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:11,911
those dog heads.

355
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:15,214
Uh, yes, I'd like
to mail this to a whore.

356
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:16,849
Okay, fine, Meg!

357
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:19,152
I used the body to get me
into R-rated movies.

358
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:20,553
After that,
I took him swimming

359
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:21,854
and he fell apart.

360
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,123
Chris, Mr. Dougan's
wake is tomorrow,

361
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:26,859
and there's going to be
a body in that casket.

362
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:29,262
If it's not his,
it's going to be yours.

363
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:31,114
Hey, guys,
what's goin' on?

364
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:32,715
And no one says anything,

365
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,201
which means they hate it.

366
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,091
Oh, God.

367
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:44,093
I am so hung over.

368
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:45,261
(groans):
Me, too.

369
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:46,829
But luckily,
when I'm hung over,

370
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:48,765
I can just molt
into another Peter.

371
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,834
(grunting)

372
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:53,369
Wow, that's amazing.

373
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:54,871
Yeah, but for the next
ten minutes,

374
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:56,539
I'll be very vulnerable
to predators.

375
00:14:56,573 --> 00:14:57,540
(growling)

376
00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:58,541
(gasps)
Mountain lion.

377
00:14:58,575 --> 00:14:59,742
Make yourself look big!

378
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:01,477
(growls)

379
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:04,447
(engines rumbling)

380
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:05,481
What the hell?

381
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:08,985
There's a bunch
of bulldozers out there.

382
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,003
(engines rumbling)

383
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:16,626
Hold it, hold it!
What-what's going on?

384
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,010
We're here to
demolish this building

385
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:19,645
by order of the bank.

386
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,013
Like hell you are!

387
00:15:21,048 --> 00:15:23,649
Wh-What are you
talking about, Peter?

388
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:25,518
We ain't goin' nowhere.

389
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:27,503
This bar belongs to us.

390
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,305
(ice cream truck chiming)

391
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,407
(gasps)
Ice cream truck!

392
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:34,610
You didn't get any ice cream?

393
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:36,312
The ice cream man
was handsome.

394
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:37,613
I got nervous.

395
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:47,869
We interrupt this program

396
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:50,005
for a Channel Five
breaking news report.

397
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,641
Three local men
have barricaded themselves

398
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,443
inside a Quahog bar,
and are currently

399
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:56,111
in a standoff with authorities.

400
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:57,846
We now go live to Joyce Kinney,

401
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,215
who attended her sister's
wedding last night.

402
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:01,216
Thanks, Tom.

403
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,384
One of the suspects has been

404
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:04,119
identified as Peter Griffin.

405
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:05,454
But the real story is,

406
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:06,638
I'd be married, too,

407
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:08,607
if I were willing
to date a Persian.

408
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:09,875
Guys, they found him.

409
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:11,293
Don't bother
with the posters.

410
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:12,828
My God,
what is Peter thinking?!

411
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:15,197
Yes, he's crazy as
a serial killer.

412
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:17,599
All right, what do you
want for your last meal?

413
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,735
Uh, I think I'll
just have a salad.

414
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:20,802
Dressing on the side.

415
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:23,138
I had a <i>huge</i> last lunch.

416
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:27,893
All right, listen up in there!

417
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:30,495
Let's not make this
any harder than it has to be.

418
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:32,547
We have a lot of dumb cops here.

419
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:33,699
Guys, this is crazy.

420
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:34,633
Plus, I'm a cop.

421
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,068
I can't be a part of this.

422
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:37,886
Come on, Joe, this is our bar.

423
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,122
It's where the three of us
made that suicide pact

424
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:42,791
that Quagmire and I are gonna
back out of at the last minute.

425
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:44,960
I'm sorry, guys,
but it's my job.

426
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:47,396
I got a family to support.

427
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:48,447
That jerk!

428
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:49,614
How could he desert us?

429
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,416
Relax, Quagmire,
he's just doing his job.

430
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:52,684
You'll forgive him.

431
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:54,953
Just like Kathleen Turner
forgave her mirror.

432
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:55,987
Sorry.

433
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:58,156
Turns out you were
right about me.

434
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,793
LOIS:
Officer, wait!

435
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:04,529
I'm his wife;
give me that bullhorn.

436
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,465
Peter, you get out here
right now,

437
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,066
or else I'm throwing away

438
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:11,169
all of your
Mr. Potato Heads, I swear.

439
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:13,872
It's okay, she only knows
where the decoys are.

440
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:15,824
Swanson, there you are.

441
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:17,676
Listen, you hang out
at this dump.

442
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,961
I want you to go in there
and end this thing.

443
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:21,263
I'll do my best, sir.

444
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:27,602
PETER:
<i>This is our bar.</i>

445
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:30,071
<i>It's the cornerstone</i>
<i>of our friendship.</i>

446
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:31,656
TIM GUNN:
<i>Joe, this is Tim Gunn.</i>

447
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:33,158
<i>I agree with your friend.</i>

448
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:36,144
I got to get that guy
out of my head.

449
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,113
Look, they're sending Joe in.

450
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:40,499
All right, listen up, fellas.

451
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:42,768
Joe, wait, put your gun down.

452
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:44,870
There's no point
in fighting anymore.

453
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:46,838
We'll leave quietly.

454
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:48,340
Like hell you will.

455
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:49,608
This is our Clam,

456
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:52,544
and we are <i>not</i>
gonna let them take it.

457
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:55,046
Yay! All right!
All right! Yeah!

458
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:58,066
We love Joe!

459
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,786
Swanson, what the hell's
going on in here?

460
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,070
I'm sorry, Chief.

461
00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:04,573
I just can't let them
bulldoze this building.

462
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:06,208
Hey, Joe, is this
the same chief

463
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:07,843
whose wife is a real hog?

464
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:09,344
Swanson, don't be a fool.

465
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:11,713
You really want to throw away
your career on this?

466
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:13,482
Guys, your bar is gone.

467
00:18:13,516 --> 00:18:14,983
And since
it's bank property,

468
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:18,270
I have no choice but to place
you all under arrest.

469
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:20,739
JEROME: It ain't
bank property no more.

470
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:25,510
Jerome?!
What are you doing here?

471
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:27,212
Listen, it's kind of
all my fault

472
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:28,680
this happened
in the first place.

473
00:18:28,714 --> 00:18:31,183
I'm responsible
for Horace's death.

474
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:33,385
Plus, as a former athlete,
it's my responsibility

475
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,822
to invest my earnings
in a restaurant, bar,

476
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:37,989
or car dealership.

477
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:39,324
What sport did you play?

478
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:40,325
Lacrosse.

479
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,360
Which is also
my brother's name.

480
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:44,496
Look, I felt bad
about what I did to Horace.

481
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,264
So, when I heard on the news

482
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,732
that they were tearing down
his bar,

483
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:51,036
I saw buying it as a way
to carry on Horace's legacy.

484
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,471
So I own the Clam now.

485
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:55,574
Chief, you can call
off your cops.

486
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,476
And you can send those
bulldozers home.

487
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,145
Yay, the Clam is saved!

488
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,013
(cheering)
Yeah! All right.

489
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:03,281
We pulled it off, guys.

490
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:04,599
Oh, thank God.

491
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:06,501
And all because
I believed in myself

492
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,537
like Pop-Pop always said.

493
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:10,622
Please give me rat poison,

494
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:12,624
I want only to die.

495
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:15,644
No, we did it, Pop-Pop.

496
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:20,599
Meg, the family is here

497
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:21,783
for Mr. Dougan's wake,

498
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:24,169
so could you please
bring in the body?

499
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:26,338
Meg, I'm not doing this.

500
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:27,505
You have to, Chris.

501
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,591
Siblings have to look
out for each other.

502
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,959
Like the Mannings.

503
00:19:30,993 --> 00:19:33,428
Eli, you threw
for three touchdowns today,

504
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:36,164
which isn't bad,
except Peyton had four.

505
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:38,800
Well, Cooper got pre-approved
for a Visa card today.

506
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:41,469
Come on, guys,
we all had a good day.

507
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:47,475
Stop it.

508
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,777
I have an itch.

509
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,245
I don't care.

510
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,080
Dead people don't
scratch their balls.

511
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:53,331
Well, I can't help it.

512
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,866
It's these damn wool pants.

513
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:56,217
I'm going bananas.

514
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:58,420
If I can't scratch them,
you have to.

515
00:19:58,454 --> 00:20:00,088
Shh!

516
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,293
Just, uh, straightening out
his pants a little.

517
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:07,562
CHRIS: Oh, yeah...
yeah, that's good.

518
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:09,564
Scratch it. Scratch it.

519
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,533
Oh, thank you.

520
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:14,269
Hello, I'm Helen Dougan.

521
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:16,388
My husband had filled out
an organ donor card

522
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:17,589
before he passed away,

523
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:21,326
and a woman just lost
her face in a freak accident.

524
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,833
Meg, though you cannot tell,
I am frowning.

525
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:33,872
Wow, Jerome, the
place looks great.

526
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,907
Yeah, look at you,
owning a bar.

527
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,542
You guys are doing
pretty good.

528
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:39,477
First you get to run
Somalia, now this.

529
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:40,612
Well, it sure is good

530
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:42,180
to be back in the old Clam.

531
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:44,516
Hey, there's some guys
sitting in our booth.

532
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:48,119
Maybe we should tell them
it's our booth.

533
00:20:48,154 --> 00:20:50,523
Uh-huh. Or we could
just sit on the floor,

534
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:51,838
next to these garbage cans.

535
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:56,938
