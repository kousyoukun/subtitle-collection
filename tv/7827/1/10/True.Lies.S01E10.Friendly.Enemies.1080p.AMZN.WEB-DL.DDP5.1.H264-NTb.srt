1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,872
<i>I'm Harry Tasker,
husband, dad, computer salesman,</i>

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:08,008
<i>and for 17 years the most
important person in my life</i>

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,044
<i>didn't know
I was also something else.</i>

4
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:13,381
<i>Omega Sector's top spy.</i>

5
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>I'm Helen Tasker,</i>

6
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,784
<i>wife, mom and professor.</i>

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,619
<i>After an unfortunate incident</i>

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,155
<i>where I found out
our whole life was a lie,</i>

9
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,824
<i>now I'm also a spy.</i>

10
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,694
<i>Honey, all those things
are true.</i>

11
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,396
<i>They're just, you know...
What?</i>

12
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,964
<i>True lies.</i>

13
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:45,979
Babe, hurry.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,415
I'm trying.

15
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,419
I think they're
searching the offices.

16
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:52,986
What do you want me
to do if they come in?

17
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,688
Shoot them.

18
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,336
Ah. Bingo.

19
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,404
Okay.
Guys, I got guards incoming.

20
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,373
I don't think
I can do this.

21
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:14,808
Ah.

22
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,544
You can do this, honey.
This is what you trained for.

23
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,912
I didn't kill anyone
in training, Harry.

24
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,148
On these missions,
you're always the one

25
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,615
that does all the real shooting.

26
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:25,353
No shooting necessary.

27
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:26,854
Come on.

28
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,922
How much time
do we have left?

29
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,291
30 seconds.

30
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,760
I'm not talking
about the bomb. Oh.

31
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,197
Uh, 19 minutes.
Oh, hope there's no traffic.

32
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,765
Yeah, okay.

33
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,549
Nice work, guys.

34
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:56,650
It was Helen's
first time

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,186
guarding the door.
She did great.

36
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,154
Yeah, only because I didn't
have to shoot anybody.

37
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,356
I almost wet my tactical pants.

38
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,458
What's our ETA?

39
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,726
Seven minutes.

40
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,127
We're cutting it pretty close.
Hit the gas.

41
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,896
You got it.

42
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,030
Whoa!

43
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,934
It's insanity.

44
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,770
And the travel budget
for the geology department

45
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,407
is a knife fight
for every dollar.

46
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,643
But anthropology can
travel anywhere they want.

47
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,379
I'm telling you, it's a war.

48
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,615
You know, I heard

49
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:28,982
that there was a huge explosion

50
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,884
at the Venezuelan Consulate tonight.

51
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,355
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

52
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,224
I ran out to get
some more cilantro,

53
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:37,425
almost didn't
make it back

54
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,126
because I-395

55
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:40,494
was gridlocked.

56
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,896
But I knew
a shortcut,

57
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,066
so I cut across three lanes
to the exit.

58
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,236
Sounds like you guys get
all the excitement.

59
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,503
We do.

60
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,340
I can't believe

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,774
worrying about shooting someone

62
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,143
wasn't the worst part of my day.

63
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,578
That was awful.

64
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,146
There's something
about Doug's voice

65
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,914
that just makes me want
to punch him in the throat.

66
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,049
Harry.

67
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,551
But in a nice way.

68
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,719
I don't understand
why it's so hard

69
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,455
to find couple friends.

70
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,324
You know? It was already
hard enough before,

71
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,925
and now that we're both spies,

72
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,961
it's, like, do we have
anything in common with anyone?

73
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,929
Well, I thought
we really hit it off

74
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,698
with that couple
from counterintel.

75
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,468
The people who wouldn't
stop talking about

76
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,202
"high-end encryption

77
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,405
for secure
data systems"?

78
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,007
Honey, more like
counter-interesting.

79
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,843
Maybe it's too hard.

80
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,512
It's not like anyone's gonna
understand what it's like

81
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,348
to be us. Other
spies aren't married.

82
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,983
Well, you still have
your yoga friends,

83
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,618
and I still have
my bowling pals.

84
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,952
I know, but
I want people that

85
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,988
we can be ourselves
around, you know?

86
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,023
Like, you could do
spy stuff with him,

87
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,327
and then I could talk to her
about clothes and guns.

88
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:47,628
And then, at the
end of the day,

89
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,630
we could all laugh
about spy snafus.

90
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,098
Like, when you
throw a grenade,

91
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,667
but you forgot to pull
the pin.

92
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,037
That's a nice dream, honey.

93
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,372
I know.

94
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,707
Who am I kidding?

95
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,310
I guess it's just
more boring dinners

96
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,679
with Alice and Doug.

97
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,052
Hey, you know what
wouldn't be boring?

98
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,220
What?

99
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:14,855
Punching Doug in the throat.

100
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,390
No?
No punching, either.

101
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,825
Just one time?
No.

102
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,661
That would be so much fun.

103
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,441
All right, guys.
Intel combed through the data

104
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,509
we stole last night,

105
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,078
and it's bad.
Eyes up on screen.

106
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,718
Omega Sector
has determined that rogue

107
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,120
Cuban General
Hernan Alvaro Ochoa

108
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,758
has gained control
of a long-range mobile missile.

109
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,927
Ochoa is known
to hold anti-Western views.

110
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,864
Analysis suggests that
he plans to attack Miami,

111
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,433
initiating a new Cold War

112
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,701
and allowing
hard-line communists

113
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,203
to seize control in Cuba.

114
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,073
When's he planning on launching?

115
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,576
Soon as his code guy
deciphers the launch codes.

116
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,578
Ooh, so we're off to Havana?

117
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,045
Not exactly.

118
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,047
American spies in Cuba
can make things worse.

119
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,248
Plus, Ochoa's got

120
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,584
eyes everywhere.
We can't get near him,

121
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:20,421
which is where
these guys come in.

122
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,322
Valentina and
Emilio Pérez,

123
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,091
bigwigs in Cuba's
defense department.

124
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,826
They'll be in Panama
for meetings.

125
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:29,162
Harry, Helen, you're gonna pose
as American diplomats,

126
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,531
cozy up to them,

127
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,833
and recruit them
to take Ochoa out.

128
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,535
Gib, it's gonna take
a lot of cozying up to

129
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,504
to convince people
to kill a general.

130
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,105
Yeah, well,
that's the gig.

131
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,674
The good news is,
the Pérez family has lobbied

132
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,142
to strengthen
U.S.-Cuban relations.

133
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,811
I doubt they'll want
all that hard work

134
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,513
to go up
in a mushroom cloud.

135
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,615
Uh-huh, and
the bad news?

136
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,050
Bad news is we know zilch
about how to make the approach.

137
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,052
Which means we're gonna
have to go to Panama,

138
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,887
do some recon,
and execute the world's

139
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,589
fastest
recruitment op.

140
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,290
We leave tomorrow.

141
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,731
So, I have some exciting news.

142
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,499
Aunt Fannie
has invited

143
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,635
you guys to her
annual lake trip.

144
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:10,103
Wait, actually?
With Cousin Tori?

145
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,072
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. You guys leave tomorrow.

146
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,641
Awesome.
You know,

147
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,108
I've always wanted
to waterski with Tori.

148
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,377
She posts the dopest tricks
on her Instagram.

149
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,014
What about you, Dana?
You don't seem so excited.

150
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,717
Yeah, yeah, it's exciting.

151
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,087
Oh, come on, this is
gonna be great. I mean,

152
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,556
you guys and Tori
have been

153
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:29,757
super tight
since you were babies.

154
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:30,791
I remember
when you three

155
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,859
used to take
baths together.

156
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,227
Yes. Aw.
It was so cute.

157
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,829
I should get
those pictures out.
Mm-hmm.

158
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,631
No.
Uh, please don't.

159
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,734
I'm just kidding. I'm saving
those for your prom dates.

160
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,002
Good one, Mom.

161
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,070
Hilarious.
Thank you very much.

162
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,638
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

163
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,939
Okay, come on,
go and pack.

164
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,241
You're gonna have fun.
You got to get going.

165
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,242
And don't forget,

166
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,478
they're kind of churchy,

167
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,112
so you're gonna want
to pack your one-piece.

168
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,581
I don't have
a one-piece, Mom.

169
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,315
Didn't I buy her
a one-piece?

170
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,617
I think so.

171
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,697
<i>Okay, team, here's the plan.</i>

172
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:12,600
<i>Harry, Helen, you're checking
into the Pérez's hotel</i>

173
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,934
<i>as American diplomats.</i>

174
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,536
<i>I got you a room
right above them.</i>

175
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,505
<i>You'll rope down,
break in, and look for intel</i>

176
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,440
<i>you can use to befriend them.
Hobbies, foods, whatever.</i>

177
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,309
<i>The Pérezes have reservations
at the hotel restaurant.</i>

178
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,144
<i>Luther, Maria,
you'll keep an eye on them,</i>

179
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,813
<i>make sure they don't walk in</i>

180
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:26,947
<i>on our snooping.</i>

181
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,016
<i>So, hit the restaurant</i>

182
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,018
<i>and scout out
surveillance locations.</i>

183
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,487
<i>Have fun out there.</i>

184
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,456
Geez.

185
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,892
Is this the only way
we enter a room anymore?

186
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,528
Climbing on ropes
on buildings?

187
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,930
Did everyone completely forget
about doors?

188
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,933
Well, we have to avoid
security cameras, so, yeah.

189
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,801
Feels weird spying on someone

190
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,002
to pretend to be their friends.

191
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,871
Helen, look at it
this way.

192
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,574
If we had spied on those parents
from Dana's soccer team,

193
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,408
we would've found out
about their pyramid scheme

194
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,445
before we invited them
to game night.

195
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,680
Mm-hmm.

196
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,281
Ready?

197
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,919
Okay.

198
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,321
You guys in place?
Status report?

199
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,323
LUTHER
Identifying targets now.

200
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,261
Yup, that's them.

201
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,630
Four exits.

202
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,632
I have two. Luther has two.

203
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,268
If the Pérezes move, we'll know.

204
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,004
Someone's heading their way.

205
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,876
She's the Pérez's aide.

206
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,778
Flor Alvarez.

207
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,546
Awfully friendly.
Do all Cubans

208
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,815
smooch their staff?
It's a Latino thing.

209
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,850
That's just how
we greet each other.

210
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,051
You're Colombian.

211
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,587
You don't greet me like that.

212
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,189
Maybe if you learn Spanish
and move to Bogotá.

213
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,423
I speak Spanish.

214
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,425
Some Spanish.
I mean, how many words

215
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,561
do you have to know
to get a cheek kiss?

216
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,066
Sir? I believe
you're at my table.

217
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,889
<i>Clearly, it's not</i>

218
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,091
your table, as I was
already sitting there.

219
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,260
I had
it reserved.

220
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,529
You know, it didn't
say "reserved" on it.

221
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,497
Gib, we have a problem.

222
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:25,866
Some creep wants Luther

223
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,701
to move from
his surveillance position.

224
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,236
Luther, get rid of this clown.

225
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,639
Hey, pal, there's lots
of other tables

226
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,807
in the restaurant.

227
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,076
I'm not your pal.

228
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,277
Ooh.

229
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,447
Crap. I think
this is escalating.

230
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,517
Hah, there we go. The laptop.

231
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,490
Harry.

232
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,961
She's reading the Spanish
version of <i>The Orchid Temple.</i>

233
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,296
Perfect. It's a great way
for you guys

234
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,665
to connect.

235
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:58,799
Remember, it's the book
about the blacksmith

236
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,300
who's dying of a broken heart?

237
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,035
Yeah, I think
<i>The Orchid Temple</i> is, uh,

238
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,037
way more your area
of expertise on this op.

239
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,307
Your loss, honey.
It's a beautiful book.

240
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:12,713
Harry,

241
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,181
I will tell you this,

242
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,684
this woman has
amazing taste in clothing.

243
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:17,985
Oh.
Oh, and looks like

244
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,319
they just went shopping.

245
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,755
All right, this is gonna
take a minute.

246
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,191
Harry, lots of shopping.

247
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,160
Looks like they bought
some new Vans.

248
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,096
One green, one blue.

249
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,630
They must have children.

250
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,300
That's so sweet. I bet
they have teenagers like us.

251
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,602
Harry,
look at this rum.

252
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,040
<i>Amiguitos.</i>

253
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,909
It means "little buddies."

254
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,477
Harry, they sound fun.

255
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,414
Helen, they are
foreign intelligence targets.

256
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,883
Yeah, fun targets.

257
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,985
Sorry.

258
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,491
What did he say?
What did you say?

259
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,928
It doesn't matter.
We have a job to do.

260
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,932
Gib, target's on the move.

261
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,366
What? Where?

262
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,068
They're leaving
out the east exit.

263
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,469
Probably heading
back to the room.

264
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,371
Harry, Helen, uh,
we lost the Pérezes.

265
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,506
I need you guys to peace out
of there right now.

266
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,276
All right, we got to go.

267
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,953
Come on, go, go, go, go, go.

268
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,433
A little nightcap.

269
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,684
Does this lipstick say,
"Take out a general for me"?

270
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:59,820
Honey, you could take
out the whole regime.

271
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,054
Hmm.

272
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,355
GIB
All right, the Pérezes

273
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,757
just arrived
for their lunch reservation.

274
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,658
You two ready
to make the approach?

275
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,693
HARRY
We're almost ready.

276
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,028
Hey, what's your 20?

277
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,362
Any suspicious activity
in your area?

278
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,498
Luther and Maria
did a sweep.

279
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,766
Everything looks clear,

280
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:13,801
but we're set up
in the alley just in case.

281
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,803
All right, we're on our way.

282
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,170
I hope Valentina
likes this dress.

283
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,207
I can already tell
she's a vibrant lady.

284
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,541
So, I wore green,

285
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,943
and it's
a little vintage, but

286
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,177
when I looked through
all of her stuff,

287
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,813
I noticed she had
kind of a retro style.

288
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,647
Well, everything's
pretty much retro in Cuba.

289
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,582
I know all of her favorite
foods, I know all

290
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,650
of her favorite hobbies.
I feel like

291
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,352
she's my best friend already.

292
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,187
But remember, this is a mission.
We're not here to get

293
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,356
couple's massages with these
people. We're recruiting them

294
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,126
to take out a rogue general
that wants to blow up Miami.

295
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,995
Yes. All the more reason
to wear the right dress.

296
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,433
It's Dana.

297
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,767
Tell her I said hi.

298
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,202
Hi, honey. What's up?

299
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,638
Mom, I need you to come get me,
like, right now.

300
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,373
Wait, slow down.
What's going on?

301
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,975
It was a mistake coming here.

302
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,377
Okay? I don't know how
to waterski at all.

303
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:00,213
So?
So?

304
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,882
He's here.

305
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,617
I mean, I thought that he
might be, and he definitely is.

306
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,887
Wait, who's he?
Yousif.

307
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,922
All right?
It's Tori's old neighbor.

308
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,557
He's visiting
from college.

309
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,159
From college?

310
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,928
Mom, I'm not gonna date him,
okay? I just, I don't want

311
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,729
to look stupid.
I don't know how to waterski,

312
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,231
and Tori, she's this pro.

313
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,867
Okay, well, if you're
so worried about it,

314
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,534
why don't you ask Tori
if she can teach you?

315
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,071
I can't. That's the thing.
She's gonna convince me to try,

316
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,039
I'm gonna wipe out,
all of her friends

317
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,740
are gonna post about it,
and I'm literally

318
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,442
gonna have to go into hiding.

319
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,145
Dana, it's okay to ask for help.

320
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,547
It's more than okay.
It's very brave.

321
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,783
Mom, it's not that simple.

322
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,518
It is that simple.

323
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,353
It's also hard.

324
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,391
Whatever. I have to go.

325
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,793
Okay, well, all right.
Well, tell your brother

326
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:49,129
that he needs to wear
his sunscreen, and

327
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:52,165
we love you. Goodb...

328
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,666
Every time.

329
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,469
GIB
Okay, the Pérezes
are at the bar.

330
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,538
Status report?

331
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,408
Gib, we're in.
Making our approach now.

332
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,943
Copy.

333
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,813
<i>Dos Amiguitos, por favor.</i>

334
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,281
"Amigwee-toes."

335
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,050
I can't believe
you can't pronounce

336
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,551
the name of
your favorite rum.

337
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,353
Did I do it again?
He did.

338
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,322
Are you an <i>Amiguitos</i> man?

339
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,225
Amiguitos?
It's a very good rum, yes.

340
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,960
Make it four.

341
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,795
Oh, that's very generous of you,

342
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,597
but my wife and I,
we have plans.

343
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,133
Oh, come on, just one drink.

344
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,668
I'm Nick Smith, by the way.
This is my wife, Amy.

345
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,837
Hi.

346
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,005
Emilio Pérez.

347
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,240
My wife, Valentina.

348
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,043
Valentina.
We really need to go.

349
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,978
It's too late.
He already poured them.

350
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,212
Come on,
just one drink.

351
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,713
It's not every day
you get to meet people

352
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,383
with really good taste in rum.

353
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,185
One.
One.
Oh.

354
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,755
Is this dress
Clandestina?

355
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,457
Yes. You know it?

356
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,359
Yes, I adore
Cuban designs.

357
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,261
It's just, you can never
get them in the States.

358
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,964
<i>Bueno.</i> You can't get them
in Cuba, either.

359
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,166
So, what brings you
to Panama?

360
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,500
Uh, business.

361
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,569
Cuban Defense
Department. Mm-hmm.
Mm.

362
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,037
Mm, wow,
that's amazing.

363
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,305
And you?

364
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,873
We work for
the U.S. State Department.

365
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,475
And just between us,

366
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,809
I really wish
our countries

367
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,544
got along better.

368
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,746
We couldn't
agree more.

369
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:16,149
<i>Salud.</i>

370
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,784
Cheers.
<i>Salud.</i>

371
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,887
<i>Salud.</i>

372
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,856
Ah.
Mm.

373
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,926
I have an
idea. This is nice.

374
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,128
We should get
a table together.

375
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,297
Yeah.
Oh, we were supposed to meet

376
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,732
some people at the
embassy reception, but...

377
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,335
But those events are the most
boring things on the planet.

378
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,971
Come on, I insist.

379
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,872
Put this on our tab, too,
<i>por favor.</i>

380
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,275
GIB
You guys are doing great.

381
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,610
Keep the momentum up.

382
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,951
He's 16, and sh-she's 13. 14.

383
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,121
That's the same age
as our kids.

384
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,223
Two teens, two years apart.

385
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,691
Why didn't someone
warn us?

386
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,227
I know.

387
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,629
And then when the blacksmith
dies in his son's arms

388
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,064
in the last chapter...

389
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,465
It broke my heart.

390
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,100
This is why I'm telling everyone
all the time,

391
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,668
"Read <i>The Orchid Temple."</i>

392
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,703
"Read <i>The Orchid Temple."</i>

393
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,105
What's it called?

394
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,773
HELEN and VALENTINA:
<i>The Orchid Temple.</i>

395
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,443
You ready? Ready?
Yeah.

396
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:31,658
So, normally, I wouldn't be
so forward so fast,

397
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,327
but since we all
get along so well,

398
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,896
I was thinking,
maybe my wife and I,

399
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,600
we could talk to you
about, um, a little...

400
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,001
proposition.

401
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,473
Maybe something a... a little
outside of your comfort zone.

402
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:51,311
But, hey, what happens in Panama
stays in Panama.

403
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,046
GIB
Hey, I'm picking up
some weird signals.

404
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,915
Me, too. Do you hear this?

405
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,550
I think they're swingers.

406
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,619
No. Radio signals.

407
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,987
Something's up.

408
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,355
Whoa.

409
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,291
Do you think Harry
and Helen are gonna swing

410
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,326
with the Pérezes
to save the mission?

411
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,128
Do we listen?

412
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,164
What exactly were you proposing?

413
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,002
In Cuba,
we have a problem.

414
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,205
A rogue general called Ochoa

415
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,472
who leads
an extremist

416
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,609
faction and who plans
to bomb the U.S.

417
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,278
He thinks it will help
his little group of maniacs.

418
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,181
Mm-hmm. So, we were hoping you
could speak to your government

419
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,584
about, you know...

420
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,254
...stopping him.

421
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:39,359
Wait a minute,
you want us to "stop him"?

422
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,693
See,

423
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,895
in Cuba, he's too powerful,
too connected.

424
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,664
We cannot get to him.

425
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:45,798
But for your government,

426
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,534
maybe not that hard.

427
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,302
I mean, you said

428
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,239
you would love for our countries
to have better relations.

429
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:54,141
Wait, wait, wait.
Are they pitching us

430
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,508
on taking out Ochoa?

431
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,009
We're supposed to be
pitching them.

432
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,611
Okay.

433
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,414
I just picked up a swarm
of encrypted radio signals.

434
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,415
Eyes open, people.

435
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,916
We were planning

436
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,852
on approaching a pair of
diplomats at the embassy event.

437
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,887
But then we met
two new friends

438
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,989
working for the
State Department

439
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,958
who like <i>Amiguitos,</i> too.

440
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,593
Yeah.

441
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,995
The funny thing about that...
Guys!

442
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,031
Get out of there now.
I got bogeys incoming.

443
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,335
Luther, get us
out of here now.

444
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,471
Gib, we've got a problem.

445
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,339
What's wrong?

446
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,410
Stay calm.
We'll handle this.

447
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,820
They're here for us!

448
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,322
Harry!

449
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,327
They're Ochoa's men.

450
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,496
I thought you were bureaucrats.

451
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,665
They fight like this
at the State Department?

452
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,100
Gib, talk to me.

453
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,602
We're surrounded, all right?
Get out of there

454
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,003
now. Get out of there.

455
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,872
Go. Gotta go.

456
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,641
Harry...

457
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,713
Okay.

458
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,149
All right, all right.

459
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,555
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

460
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,690
American citizen.
Take it easy, take it easy.

461
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,561
We're American citizens.

462
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,069
They're capturing that
jackass from yesterday.

463
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,971
What's happening?

464
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:49,322
What about the team?
We can't save them
if we're dead.

465
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,758
The valet left that running.
Get in the car.

466
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,846
So...

467
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,583
I have a wobbly shoe.

468
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,852
And you two are spies?

469
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,455
<i>Sí.</i>

470
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,024
As are you, I assume.

471
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,860
<i>Que arroz con mango.</i>

472
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,262
What did he say
about mangoes?

473
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,564
It means we're in
a sticky situation.

474
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,832
I can't believe this.

475
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,434
Did you even read

476
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,168
<i>The Orchid Temple?</i>

477
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,937
What about you?

478
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,307
You're a spy, too.
Mm-hmm.

479
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,241
Was anything
about our lunch even real?
All right, look.

480
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,010
We can't trust each other,
we got that.

481
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,878
But we both want
to take out Ochoa.

482
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,747
You guys just beat us
to the punch on the ask.

483
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,649
And now we're all blown.

484
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,451
Yeah, and
somebody tipped him off.

485
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,685
You guys have a mole.

486
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,822
It was not someone
on our team.

487
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,290
Well, it wasn't ours.

488
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,958
We got a radio warning.
You didn't.

489
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,593
Plus, those commandos

490
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,529
rushed in pretty fast after
you mentioned Ochoa's name.

491
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,263
Who'd you have listening?

492
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,198
Wait.

493
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,967
Flor, sh-she was on our radios.

494
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,969
No, no, no, no, you can't think
for a second that it was Flor.

495
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,904
Because I trust her
with my life.

496
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,640
<i>Mi amor,</i>
think about it.

497
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,775
Why else would Ochoa be
in Panama?

498
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,411
She must've told him
we were going to be here

499
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:19,946
working against him.

500
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,248
As soon as we made our move,
he sent his commandos.

501
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,617
He wants to stop us
before we can stop him.

502
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,419
Oh, but Flor is
like family.

503
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,820
I mean,
she's basically

504
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,889
the third person
in our marriage. I...

505
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,724
I can't
believe this.

506
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,561
Harry, I think their Gib

507
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,163
captured our Gib.

508
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,769
You know...

509
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,905
you're gonna regret
capturing U.S. citizens.

510
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,107
I'm sure of it.
You mean U.S. spies!

511
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,912
Geez, you kick hard.

512
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,423
You run communications
for your team, right?

513
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:06,793
You're gonna radio the two
operatives who escaped my men.

514
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:09,228
And if they give me
what I want...

515
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,597
then you will live.

516
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,665
And what is it that you want?

517
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,234
Los Pérez...

518
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,036
because their execution
will be an example

519
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,338
to those
who oppose our movement.

520
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:23,209
Okay, and, uh...

521
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,678
...what about
the rest of my team?

522
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,914
They're alive.

523
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,917
For now, but that can change.

524
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,286
Oh, you have no idea

525
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,322
who you're up against,
you silly son of--

526
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,257
Hey.

527
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,692
Listen to me!

528
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,361
I think you are the one
who does not understand

529
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,230
the situation, huh?

530
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,134
If you want to see
your team again,

531
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,102
I would suggest
that you cooperate.

532
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,563
Very angry.

533
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:18,230
Yeah.

534
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,066
So...

535
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,334
you and the Pérezes
are Cuban spies?

536
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,270
Why would I tell you anything?
Spies?

537
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,373
That's why you wanted my table,
counter-intelligence.

538
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:28,808
I should've just
shot you instead.

539
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:29,942
Then we wouldn't
be here.

540
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,277
Typical communist.

541
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:32,812
Just shoot anyone
who doesn't agree with you.

542
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,346
No, not everyone.

543
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,082
Only imperialists who want
to tell us how to live.

544
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:37,584
Oh, why,
'cause we're right?

545
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:40,252
Dude, you're driving around
in, like, 50-year-old cars.

546
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,188
Thanks to your
blockade. <i>¡Oye!</i>

547
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:43,556
And call me
when your country

548
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,057
has free dental care,
you arrogant son--

549
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,126
<i>¡Basta!</i>

550
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,262
Do you guys want to die in here?

551
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,064
Now shut up.

552
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,301
We need a plan.

553
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,906
It's Gib.

554
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,447
You got to bring
the Pérezes to Ochoa.

555
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,117
He's serious, Harry.

556
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,352
I-I-I don't know what to do.

557
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:15,888
He said he's gonna kill us all.

558
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,059
Let me speak to Ochoa.

559
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,464
Listen, you want your people,
I want mine.

560
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,099
Alive and unhurt.

561
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,536
Meet me in one hour.

562
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,137
I will send the coordinates.

563
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,573
Now, as for "unhurt..."

564
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,411
...there's nothing
that won't heal.

565
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,480
Oh, my God, if we don't
give him the Pérezes,

566
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,149
he's gonna kill
Gib, Maria and Luther.

567
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,917
If we do, he's gonna
kill the Pérezes.

568
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,519
And blow up Miami, to boot.

569
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,221
Well, there has
to be another option.

570
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,090
There is something
we can try,

571
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,025
but it puts all of our lives
in their hands.

572
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,461
How much do you trust
the Pérezes?

573
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,233
They're fun.

574
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,636
But I don't know about
trusting them with our lives.

575
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,838
Can't you and I just do it?

576
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:08,240
We can, but our chances go
from low to tiny.

577
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,276
I need
exact percentages.

578
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,579
You don't want
exact percentages.

579
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,215
You haven't had a lot
of experience shooting people.

580
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,718
And we need all
the firepower we can get.

581
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,319
Yeah.

582
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,292
But how do we know?
We don't.

583
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:27,794
You just have to take a leap.

584
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:31,463
Yeah, but what if we leap,
and they don't catch us?

585
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:35,001
Then everybody dies.

586
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,409
Oh, wow, what kind of
spy sells out his team

587
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,177
the second something
goes wrong?

588
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,445
Gib didn't sell us out.

589
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,147
Oh, no?
Sounds like he rolled over

590
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,616
and gave us all up.

591
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,350
Gib was giving us intel.

592
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,484
He coughed nine times.

593
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,854
That means nine commandos
on site.

594
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,355
He repeated a word
three times

595
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,424
at the start of a sentence--
three entry points.

596
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,693
Gib wasn't giving up.
He was giving us

597
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,261
what we need to attack Ochoa.

598
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,298
We just can't do it on our own.

599
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,771
You know what you are asking
of us, right?

600
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,873
Yes. Yes, I do.

601
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,474
Forgive me, but how do
we know that you won't

602
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,143
betray us
to save your team?

603
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,277
You don't.

604
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,712
The same way
we don't know

605
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:21,013
whether or not you'll betray us.

606
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,082
But if we don't
work together,

607
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,684
everybody dies.

608
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,252
And Miami is obliterated.

609
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,120
Which means war.

610
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:32,892
Well, it looks like we all have
something to lose.

611
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,163
Okay.

612
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,131
I swear on our kids,

613
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,834
you can trust us
to have your back.

614
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,170
And I swear on ours.

615
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,573
And to be clear,

616
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:49,408
you actually
have children?

617
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,778
Because we do,
and they're amazing.

618
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:53,680
And we want
to go home to them.

619
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,347
Believe me.

620
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,149
We want the same. Yeah.

621
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:04,423
Oh, you have a whole handshake.

622
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,193
So, look, I got an idea,
but it's too risky to go back

623
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,928
to our place
and get the equipment.

624
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,763
We need guns.
That's not a problem.

625
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:13,766
There are guns everywhere.

626
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,235
Huh.

627
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,879
You guys think if you wiggle
enough, you can break

628
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,748
the ropes
with your can-do attitude?

629
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,383
You have a better
idea, <i>nena?</i>

630
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,887
Actually, <i>mijito,</i>
I do.

631
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,056
My hair clip has
a sharp edge.

632
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,992
It's my "just in case I get
tied up with a jerk" knife.

633
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,429
You mean him, right?
Oh.

634
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,497
The jury's out.

635
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,066
Tilt your head back.

636
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,235
Let me see if I can get it
with my teeth.

637
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,502
Can you,
can you do it?

638
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,704
It's just too far.

639
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,439
Right.

640
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,274
It's the wrong side.

641
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,243
Raul will have to get it.

642
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,912
You can't trust
that guy with a knife.

643
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,581
I've seen oil spills
that are less slippery than him.

644
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,151
I'm tied up next
to your mangey neck

645
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,720
because I am also
trying to stop Ochoa.

646
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,555
I want what's best
for my country.

647
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,257
<i>¡Oye!</i>

648
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,868
We're a country
of immigrants.

649
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:24,170
So if he's a pig,
then so am I.

650
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:26,605
Oh, that's actually--
Shut up, Luther.

651
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,040
Sorry.
Shut up, Luther.

652
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,109
You shut up.
We're gonna

653
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,944
have to work together
if we want to get out of here.

654
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,679
Got it?
Yes.

655
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,349
Don't get any ideas.

656
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,919
See those bars
on the window?

657
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,287
That's a stash house.

658
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,622
You're gonna find
plenty of weapons in there.

659
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,958
Let's go shopping.

660
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:51,363
Okay.

661
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,232
So they're gonna get
a bunch of guns. Mm.

662
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,567
Then we bring
them to Ochoa.

663
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,436
And then...

664
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,973
...we shoot people?

665
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,075
Yes.

666
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,911
That's sort of how it works.

667
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,846
Of course. Yeah, no.

668
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,781
Yeah, it's totally fine.

669
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,921
Oh!

670
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,923
What is it?

671
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:18,490
It's my daughter.

672
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,392
Aw.
I gave her some advice.

673
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,829
And she's letting me know
that it worked.

674
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,263
Wow. And she admitted it?

675
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:27,266
Such miracles
do not happen in Cuba.

676
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:29,468
What did you tell her?

677
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,103
I-I told her to be brave.

678
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,439
And to ask for help
when she needs it.

679
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,041
Hmm.

680
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,743
And, speaking of being brave

681
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:39,778
and asking for help...

682
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:42,581
uh, I am actually new

683
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,683
at this whole spy thing.

684
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,053
I am, I am a
professional spy.

685
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:49,721
And I've been on missions
and I, um...

686
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,323
and the gun
that I use is my own gun.

687
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,960
It was assigned to me,
and I've shot it, um...

688
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:57,429
...but I've never
actually shot anybody.

689
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,533
That...

690
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,235
never gets easy.

691
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,004
My advice?

692
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:07,539
Focus on what
you're doing it for.

693
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,109
Like saving your friends.

694
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,844
Or Miami.

695
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,447
Or not dying in a ditch
in Panama.

696
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:20,119
Yes, no, ditches are,
ditches aren't my favorite.

697
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,110
No, no, no, no, no, no!

698
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,522
<i>Lo siento.</i>

699
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:03,963
Everything okay?

700
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:05,797
We heard shooting.
<i>Muy bien.</i>

701
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:09,135
And they say Americans
and Cubans can't work together.

702
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,005
<i>Mi amor.</i>

703
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,012
Now what?

704
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,348
Spit it into my hand.

705
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,455
Did you have to use
so much spit?

706
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,125
Can you reach my ropes?

707
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,129
No, I can't reach 'em.

708
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,366
That means that you're gonna
have to cut me free first, huh?

709
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,469
All right, sit still.

710
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,104
I am sitting still.

711
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,075
Ow!

712
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:51,810
You made me drop it.
You cut my hand on purpose.

713
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,081
Guys, if we don't get that clip,
we are all going to die in here.

714
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:57,883
So let's tip over.

715
00:31:57,984 --> 00:31:59,885
Okay, let's go on three. One,

716
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:02,388
two, three.

717
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,857
See?

718
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:07,326
That wasn't so bad.

719
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,728
Tell that
to my dislocated shoulder.

720
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,497
Americans, so delicate.

721
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,532
Not so delicate
that I can't throw my head back

722
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,068
and crack you
in that thick Cuban skull.

723
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,469
When this is over,

724
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,605
I will hunt you down
wherever you are.

725
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,273
And I will kill you.

726
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,675
Okay, guys, I love the bonding
that's happening right now,

727
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,744
but can you just get the clip?

728
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,168
You ready?

729
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:51,503
Let's do this, my friends.

730
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,432
Show me you are unarmed.

731
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:33,345
<i>Bueno,</i>
yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

732
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:37,349
Your friends are inside.

733
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:40,219
You can see them
when you hand over the traitors.

734
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,887
Bring my people out first.

735
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,922
No.

736
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,158
Why don't you
join them instead?

737
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:49,395
That way you can say
your final goodbyes.

738
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,097
Now!

739
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:17,223
Keep firing!

740
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,292
Keep shooting.

741
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,072
Get down!

742
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,909
Don't think, just shoot.

743
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,702
I'll take the gun, thank you.
I knew it!

744
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:04,703
I knew we shouldn't have
trusted him!

745
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:05,771
You shouldn't even be here.

746
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,173
This is a Cuban fight.

747
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,141
Tell that to everyone in Miami.
You Americans,

748
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,377
you think everything is
about you.

749
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:28,760
He's making a run for it.

750
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,830
Go! We'll handle this.

751
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,853
Raul, slide me the gun.

752
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,388
Oh, because Americans
do everything better?

753
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,257
That'd be a pretty sick burn
if it wasn't true.

754
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,958
Come on, I have
the better angle to shoot.

755
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:03,061
Cooperate now
or I will kill you both myself.

756
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:16,208
Here.

757
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,250
My turn. <i>Dámelo.</i>

758
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:35,394
We did it.

759
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,463
Yeah.

760
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,778
Should we split up?

761
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,179
No, look.

762
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,382
Blood. This way.

763
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,761
Gib!

764
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,532
You shoot, I shoot.

765
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,568
Take the shot, Harry.

766
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,004
Take the shot, man.
He's got the missile!

767
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,872
He's gonna launch as soon
as he gets the codes.

768
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,509
My friend?

769
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,545
If you're not gonna do it,
I will have to.

770
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,051
Listen.

771
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:35,421
No one needs to die today.

772
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:41,126
Revolutions end
in victory or death.

773
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:43,895
And I am prepared
to die for Cuba.

774
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,765
Take
the shot, man.

775
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,567
It's either me or Miami.

776
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,624
I didn't think.

777
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:13,892
I just shot him.

778
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,561
I know, I know.

779
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,396
It's okay. It's over.

780
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,164
It's over.

781
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:30,108
You know you should have
shot me, right?

782
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,143
But thanks
for not shooting me.

783
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,846
Anytime.

784
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,816
Okay.

785
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,385
Just heard from Omega.

786
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,019
Ochoa's allies
have been arrested.

787
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,821
The missile is
under control.

788
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,456
And Miami is safe.

789
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,358
Which is really good,
because I have

790
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:49,661
about a third of the Dolphins
in my fantasy football lineup.

791
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,130
Mm.

792
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,166
Are you guys gonna be okay?

793
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,536
With Ochoa gone, yes.

794
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:59,971
So this is goodbye?

795
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,707
I'm afraid so.

796
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,074
Unless...

797
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,010
you defect to Cuba.

798
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,678
Cigars along the Malecón?

799
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:09,481
Or you defect to America and
we have beers on the Potomac.

800
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,616
Mm.

801
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:13,118
Hey, guys.
Exfil's almost here.

802
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,987
All right, we should go.

803
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,689
It was an honor working
with you, <i>hermano.</i>

804
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:18,890
Honor was mine.

805
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,592
I'm gonna miss you guys.

806
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,261
Yeah, me, too.

807
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:33,705
I hope I never see you again,

808
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:36,307
you... arrogant American pig.

809
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:41,046
Right back at you,
you little Cuban weasel.

810
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:43,649
Oh, get a room, will you, guys?

811
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,252
Let's go.

812
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:58,163
I mean, I wasn't,
like, nailing tricks,

813
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,298
but my slalom was solid

814
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,133
and I stuck a backward landing.

815
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,269
And the boy you were
trying to impress?

816
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,071
Mom, I wasn't trying
to impress him.

817
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,906
But he said

818
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,642
that my waterskiing
was badass. Mm.

819
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,377
Maybe the "ass" part was true.

820
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:13,378
Hey.

821
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,513
Okay, lobster.

822
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:15,947
Okay, well,

823
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:19,184
I'm just glad that you asked
for help when you needed it.

824
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,087
It could save your life one day.

825
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:23,655
Or someone else's.

826
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,658
We were just waterskiing, Mom.
We're good.

827
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,426
Yeah.

828
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,629
Your mom knows
what she's talking about.

829
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:33,331
Speaking of helping people,
why don't you help

830
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,202
your brother upstairs to put
more aloe on his sunburn?

831
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,170
All right, come on.

832
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,308
You're fine.

833
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:45,877
It's gonna look really ugly
when you start to peel.

834
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:49,581
Dana!

835
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,354
You okay?

836
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,590
Is it bad
that I miss the Pérezes?

837
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,892
No, they were super fun.

838
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:03,662
I know, but I've been thinking--

839
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,731
If we can make friends
with enemy agents,

840
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:07,766
then maybe
other couples

841
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,367
aren't so hard.

842
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,603
If we just do the work.
Mm-hmm, like

843
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,839
sneaking into their bedrooms
for intel on their hobbies?

844
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:16,274
Yeah, or going through
the neighbor's trash.

845
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:17,976
Yeah, what about that couple
in the Tudor?

846
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,410
No, Harry, I'm not
that desperate.

847
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,112
I'm just saying, I'm
haven't given up yet.

848
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,615
There's got to be
that one other couple

849
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,283
out there for us.

850
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,052
Now who sounds like a swinger?

851
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,453
Well, yeah.

852
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,421
Maybe if you get
me drunk enough.

853
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,391
Let me get the rum.

854
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,232
Ah!

855
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,236
Amiguitos!
