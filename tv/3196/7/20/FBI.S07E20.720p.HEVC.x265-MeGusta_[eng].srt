1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,020
- Stop, okay?

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,556
I'm done talking about this.
Just stop already!

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,500
- All night, you were stepping
on my words, interrupting me!

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,460
- No, I was
keeping them engaged, Peter.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,069
The way you were droning on
about your stupid IPO...

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,110
- I had it handled!

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,720
- Where have I heard that
before?

8
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,250
- I'm telling...
- Dad?

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,120
- We didn't mean
to wake you, bud.

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,770
- Why are you fighting?

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,950
- Oh, honey, we're not fighting.

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,040
Your father is
just demonstrating

13
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,520
his quintessential
Virgo tendencies.

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,040
- We're good here.

15
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,310
Linda, can you get
him back to bed?

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,830
Because you are
playing those maniacs

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,700
from Staten Island tomorrow.

18
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,620
Kids are bigger than me.

19
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,970
- No more yelling.

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,360
- You got it.

21
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,490
- You too, Mom.

22
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,810
- Believe it or not, Pete,

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,810
I was only trying to help
tonight.

24
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,600
- And I don't need your help.

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,899
I run a $50 billion company.

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,380
Well, technically, AI does.

27
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,300
Why couldn't we
get a normal oven

28
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,090
that doesn't have a computer?

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,180
- You know what this is?

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,010
- No.

31
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,710
Open it.

32
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,550
What? Who's it from?

33
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,550
- It says,
"We can get to you anywhere."

34
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,220
- So they still haven't figured
out what caused the explosion.

35
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,270
It was heard five blocks away.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,609
- Yeah.
Gemma thought it was thunder.

37
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,920
She was out with her friends.

38
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,570
Oh, she wants me to
set up a dinner.

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,570
You, Joel, me.

40
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,270
Knowing her,

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,856
it'll probably be some place
with a prix fixe menu.

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,890
- I don't see that happening.

43
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,629
Joel and I
went our separate ways.

44
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,590
- Really?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,240
- I thought everything
was going good.

46
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,386
- I guess I'm just at
this stage in my life

47
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,849
where I think more
about the future.

48
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,290
You know, where do I see myself
in five years, ten years?

49
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,639
Ah, he wasn't in it.

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
- Well, better sooner
than later, I guess.

51
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,420
- I don't know.

52
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,170
Maybe I don't need
anybody else, you know?

53
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm good on my own.

54
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,716
We gotta roll.
They want us there now.

55
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,389
- Now?

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,869
- Hey.
- What a surprise. The Feds.

57
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,010
- After that healthcare CEO
was murdered last year,

58
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,920
the DOJ has classified
attacks like this as terrorism.

59
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,880
- Peter Minskoff was a CEO.

60
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,450
This landed in our jurisdiction.

61
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,280
- Sure, when you're rich
enough, who needs the NYPD?

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
You got your own private
police force always on call.

63
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,540
- Can we see the unit?

64
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,996
- Not yet.
It's a real mess up there.

65
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,760
Half the wall is just gone.

66
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,940
- So Peter and his wife died.

67
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,070
Same with the live-in nanny?

68
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,510
But his 11-year-old son
Taylor survived?

69
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,860
- Yeah. The boy was
in his bedroom a floor below.

70
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,430
He was catatonic when
first responders got here.

71
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,950
He saw them, saw their injuries.

72
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
- What are the chances
this was a gas leak?

73
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,220
- Isotopic signatures
of the post-blast residue

74
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,610
suggest some type of
mid-sized explosive device.

75
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,066
They think it detonated
in the kitchen.

76
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,140
- So what,
a targeted assassination?

77
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,010
- Yeah, but look
where it happened.

78
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,506
In the penthouse
of the most exclusive

79
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,580
high-rise in the city.

80
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,920
I mean,
this building is a fortress.

81
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,490
How would they get
a bomb up here?

82
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,580
- Impossible.

83
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,240
No one could sneak up into
one of our penthouse units.

84
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,940
Our tenants tend to be
the 1% of the 1%.

85
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,900
They expect impeccable security
and we deliver.

86
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,550
- Never had a break-in before?

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,070
- Not once in 16 years.

88
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,510
We have high-res cameras
everywhere,

89
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,210
locked doors, armed guards 24/7.

90
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,519
You can't even use the elevators

91
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,910
without an authorized key card

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,910
that's programmed
to a specific floor.

93
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,830
- What about employees?

94
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,610
Maintenance workers, doormen, housekeepers?

95
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,440
- They'd still need to go
through the front desk.

96
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,620
Every guest provides
a facial scan

97
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,140
for our virtual visitor log.

98
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,320
A temporary key card is assigned

99
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,060
and we can track what floor
you're on at any moment.

100
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,319
- You keep that information
on file?

101
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,280
[suspenseful music

102
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,280
- Good morning.

103
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,370
So the CEO of Zinca,
the electric car company,

104
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,380
was blown up last night
in his penthouse.

105
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,640
And his wife, Serena,

106
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,600
and a live-in nanny,
Linda Ramirez,

107
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,990
were both victims as well.

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,380
Their son, Taylor, survived.

109
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,080
He was released from Bellevue
and is with relatives.

110
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,520
We are withholding their names
for now.

111
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,610
The media believes this was
a gas explosion,

112
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,650
and we are going to
let them think that.

113
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,530
- Mm. Preferential treatment?

114
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,350
- Well, they are high-profile
and well-connected

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,936
and we're being pressured
to close this case

116
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
quickly and quietly.

117
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,450
But we don't have a problem
with that, right?

118
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,750
- No, ma'am.

119
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,490
- Great.

120
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,020
All right, let's table
all tier 2 and tier 3 cases.

121
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,240
This is now our top priority.

122
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,670
Identify this bomber
and bring him to justice.

123
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,550
- You heard the boss.
So let's... let's talk theories.

124
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,980
- Peter Minskoff,
a self-described disruptor,

125
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,640
has many enemies in the oil
and auto industries.

126
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,130
Zinca's base model was one of
the top-selling cars last year.

127
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
- Hmm.

128
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,536
A legacy company targeting
an industry disruptor?

129
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,950
What else?

130
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,536
- Zinca had its share
of consumer issues.

131
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,430
Battery fires,
auto driving accidents,

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,570
several class actions
with outstanding settlements.

133
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,700
- Right.
Plenty of motive, then.

134
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,806
So let's talk about something
they'd be in short supply of:

135
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,049
opportunity.

136
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,530
Who would be able
to slip an explosive

137
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,270
up into their
well-guarded penthouse?

138
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,416
Where are we at
with the list of visitors

139
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,580
Dani and Scola pulled
from building security?

140
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,930
- Still combing through it.

141
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,230
Minskoffs had housekeepers,
personal trainers,

142
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,020
private shoppers,
massage therapists.

143
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,710
It was like Grand Central
up there.

144
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,059
- Different lifestyle.

145
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,280
Any visitors not on the payroll?

146
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,500
- Only one in the past month,
a Dejan Petrovic,

147
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,290
a repairman who works
for Gladstone Appliance.

148
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,859
Here he is arriving
for a service call.

149
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,030
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

150
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,040
Okay, I'm looking at that bag.
- Yeah.

151
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,706
He allegedly arrived
to do some maintenance work

152
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,690
on an induction stove
for the Minskoffs.

153
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,259
- Well, the explosion originated

154
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
in the kitchen, right?

155
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,390
When was this?

156
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,390
- Yesterday, six hours before.

157
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,090
- Consider my interest piqued.

158
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,530
- Hey, got something.
- Yeah?

159
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,270
- Turns out Gladstone Appliance

160
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,970
is one of several fronts
for the YACS.

161
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,130
- By the YACS, I'm guessing

162
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,710
referring
to the criminal networks

163
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,620
operating here from Yugoslavia,
Albania, Croatia, and Serbia?

164
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,230
- The one and only.

165
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,190
The YACS aren't a cohesive gang,

166
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,330
but one of the smaller groups
behind Gladstone Appliance

167
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,200
have been moving into
labor racketeering,

168
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,850
squeezing businesses
across Queens,

169
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,420
including...
- Let me guess.

170
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,160
Zinca Electric Cars.

171
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,770
- Zinca just opened
a new factory in Queens.

172
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,160
State-of-the-art,
right in the YACS' backyard,

173
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,690
and Peter Minskoff
is staunchly anti-union.

174
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,430
- Okay, so the gang was

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,430
squeezing Zinca
in a labor dispute.

176
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,949
So they use a repairman
to slip into his home

177
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,870
and send the company a message.

178
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,350
- Well, that tracks.
Where's Dejan Petrovic now?

179
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,149
- FBI! Nobody move!

180
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,590
- Hands where we can see them!

181
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,889
- All right, everybody stays
right where they are!

182
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,370
DJ, kill it!

183
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,030
- All right, listen up.

184
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,289
We're here for Dejan Petrovic!

185
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,380
- We know that you're in here.

186
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,470
Okay? This is your chance
to come willingly.

187
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,690
No?

188
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,860
All right, house lights up.

189
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,300
- He's running!

190
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,780
- Go!
- Hey, stop!

191
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,440
Move! Move! Move! Move!

192
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,700
- Move!

193
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,180
- Hey!

194
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,540
- No, you don't.

195
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,240
- You good?

196
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,770
- Golden.

197
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,820
Here's the story.

198
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,769
Your gang was squeezing Zinca's
new plant in a labor dispute.

199
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,170
- But CEO Peter Minskoff
pushed back.

200
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,560
He refused to capitulate.

201
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,090
- So you decided
to send a message.

202
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,220
- Yeah, sure.

203
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,620
- Well, that's gotta be a land
speed record for a confession.

204
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,710
- Don't you have
to offer me something now?

205
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,010
- What?

206
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,010
- For cooperating.
- Yeah.

207
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,010
How's life in prison sound?

208
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,630
- A little extreme.

209
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,190
- You seem awfully relaxed
for someone that just

210
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,720
murdered one of the country's
richest men.

211
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,070
- What? What are you saying?

212
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,770
- Peter and Serena Minskoff.
Both dead thanks to you.

213
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,600
Their nanny, dead.

214
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,250
Their 11-year-old son, orphaned.

215
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,250
- No, no, no,
I didn't kill nobody.

216
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,250
I went to his penthouse
to scare the guy,

217
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,600
to show him how close
we could get.

218
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,080
Guy's got more money than God,

219
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,870
but he wants to bust our
unions, hurt our families?

220
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,260
- Tell us about the bomb.

221
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,660
- What bomb?
All I did was leave a note.

222
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,490
- Dejan, we have you on video

223
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,570
talking your way
past building security,

224
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,099
telling the guard
that you were there

225
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,839
to calibrate the induction oven.

226
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,360
- I mean, yeah, sure,
but I didn't do that.

227
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,450
- Hey, your crew is suspected
in nine open homicides.

228
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,460
We know your tactics.

229
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,020
I've got footage of you
entering the penthouse

230
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,460
hours before the blast
carrying a large bag.

231
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,900
- My tools.
Those are just my tools.

232
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,900
I repair ovens.

233
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,250
Wait.

234
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,650
I can prove it.

235
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,560
His stove,
it's a Heinrich Chef series.

236
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,259
Got a smart camera
built right in.

237
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,480
- A camera? In the oven?

238
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,920
- So the rich people can watch
their food while it cooks.

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,750
But the footage...

240
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,270
it gets uploaded
to Heinrich's cloud site.

241
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,920
You can watch it. You'll see.

242
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,970
I didn't do this.

243
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,890
- Well, I don't know why anyone
would need or want a live feed

244
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,150
from their oven, but right now,
I'm glad it exists.

245
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,550
What's going on, pal?

246
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,200
- Queuing up this timecode
to when building security

247
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,470
gave Dejan Petrovic access
to the penthouse.

248
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,860
- All right, folks,
let's take a look.

249
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,390
Uh, yeah, here's our guy.

250
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,220
What's he doing,
looking for the explosive?

251
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,349
- That is just an envelope.

252
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,569
- Right. No, the... the threat.

253
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,870
He said all he did was sneak in
and leave the letter.

254
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,010
- No sign of a bomb or any IED.

255
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,010
- So what, this guy's
telling the truth then?

256
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,180
You know what? Scrub forward.

257
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,140
Let's see what
the camera catches

258
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,230
right before the explosion.

259
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,799
- Okay.
This is 11:34 p.m. Eastern.

260
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,110
Those legs are Serena Minskoff
coming home.

261
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,460
- Yeah.
And there's no audio, right?

262
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,590
- No.
You wanna hear from your food?

263
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,250
Rewind that and then
go frame by frame.

264
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Stop it right there.

265
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,300
What the hell is that?

266
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,690
- Jubal, it happened again.

267
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,559
Another penthouse just exploded.

268
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,740
- Excuse me?

269
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,609
- It's a live video
of the Solace Hotel.

270
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,936
- What... what...
what is happening?

271
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,130
See if you can find footage
of the detonation.

272
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,009
- Aftermath is
all over social media.

273
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,570
Maybe somebody caught
the moment before it happened?

274
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,750
Yeah, okay, found one here. Go.

275
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
- With vegan cream cheese
and hot honey...

276
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,490
Oh, my God.

277
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,930
- Okay, rewind it.

278
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,540
This area right here,
enlarge it frame by frame.

279
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,460
- Let me see if I can
isolate the clearest frame.

280
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,380
- That's the same object
that's in the kitchen.

281
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,640
- Yeah, I'd rather not,

282
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,250
but somebody's gotta say it
out loud.

283
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,810
We are looking at

284
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,340
the first-ever drone strikes
on U.S. soil.

285
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,730
Gang, we're under attack.

286
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,580
- All right, folks.

287
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,820
So drone strikes have happened
in civilian centers

288
00:12:06,854 --> 00:12:09,204
all around the world...
Chechnya, Ukraine, Africa.

289
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,855
It was only a matter of time
before it happened here.

290
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,540
So what have we learned
from this new one?

291
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,646
- Maggie and OA are on the
scene of the second explosion.

292
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,320
They just ID'd
our second victim,

293
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,590
Edwin Archer, CEO of Piranha,

294
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,410
the online ticket sales hub
based out of D.C.

295
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,900
- So two prominent CEOs were
executed by drones in our city.

296
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,306
Someone has declared war
on big business,

297
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,120
and I wanna know who.

298
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,160
- Okay, we've been
given the dots.

299
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,120
Now we've gotta connect them,
all right?

300
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,080
So where do our dead CEOs
overlap?

301
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,990
Common enemies?
Scorned clients?

302
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,910
Foreign rivals?

303
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,080
- Well, we've been looking,

304
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,130
but there's no public link
between the two.

305
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,390
- Well, both are
"Fortune" 100 companies.

306
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,920
Maybe we're dealing
with violent activists

307
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,400
targeting wealthy corporations.

308
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,570
NSA, any luck
with online chatter?

309
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,399
- Okay, this is alarming.

310
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,320
Uh, but I analyzed the shape of
the drones used in the attacks.

311
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,726
Looks like they're
Bushcraft 200s.

312
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,670
- Bushcraft 200s. Show me.

313
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,799
- High-tech, capable
of tracking and engaging

314
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,240
non-line of sight targets
using facial rec.

315
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,510
- These are weapons of war.

316
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,510
You can't get these
at your local hobby shop.

317
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,520
How the hell did someone
get their hands on them?

318
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,600
- It looks like a shipment
of military drones

319
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,340
earmarked for Ukraine went
missing in Canada a week ago.

320
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,300
- Wait, attack drones
stolen from Canada

321
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,429
and smuggled into the U.S.?

322
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,220
- All drones broadcast
a unique signal,

323
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,870
like a digital license plate.

324
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,439
- Wait, so you can track them?

325
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,439
- Theoretically, but someone
already disabled these.

326
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,026
But before they did,
they had to turn them on.

327
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,660
Looks like they
went live yesterday.

328
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,840
Only pinged for 2 1/2 minutes.

329
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,490
- Tell me it was long enough
to pinpoint

330
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,190
their last-known location.

331
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,850
- It was.
A defunct factory in Inwood.

332
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,420
- Wait. Did you hear that?

333
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,860
- It's coming from over there.

334
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,310
- Oh, my God.
- He's been waterboarded.

335
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,660
He's alive.

336
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,670
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

337
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,890
Hey, hey. You're gonna be okay.

338
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,019
- Runner!

339
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,370
Hey!

340
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,500
- Drop it. Now.

341
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,510
- Easy, love.

342
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,940
I need a hole in my head like
I need a hole in my head.

343
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,739
- Whoever he is,
he's trained in Defendu.

344
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,310
- What's that?

345
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,286
- Close-quarters fighting style
used by British commandos.

346
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,140
- So who is he?

347
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,530
- His name is Thomas Banks,
former British special forces.

348
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,580
- That's a long way from home.
- Yeah.

349
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,970
Well, now, he works for
an asset management company.

350
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,760
He was Edwin Archer's
personal bodyguard.

351
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,759
- So he's here investigating
the same thing we are...

352
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,240
who killed his client.

353
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,279
- Yeah, except he was able
to get to the man

354
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,900
who smuggled the attack drones
into our country before we did.

355
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,680
- Okay, let's go figure out
what he learned.

356
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,820
Waterboarding was a nice touch.

357
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,870
Now you're looking
at a federal kidnapping charge

358
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,000
with enhancements
due to the use of violence.

359
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,260
That is life behind bars,

360
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,560
so I would start talking
if I was you.

361
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,130
- Oh.

362
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,310
I could whisper the word
"lawyer" and ruin all the fun.

363
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
- Why would you do that?

364
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,789
The way I see it,

365
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,206
you're incentivized
to share your intel with us.

366
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,750
We're both looking
for the same thing.

367
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,050
- Which is what?

368
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,790
- The person who bought
and deployed the drone

369
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,580
that killed your client.

370
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,019
- CEOs pay well for
private protection these days.

371
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,680
Edwin Archer spared no expense.

372
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,290
My advance team would do
TSCM sweeps and site surveys

373
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,290
on every room he walked into...

374
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,420
- Yet you missed something.

375
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,950
And it lit a fire under your
ass to figure out what, right?

376
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,040
- A client dying is
bad for business.

377
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,950
I was urged to use
every means necessary

378
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,886
to track that drone to the man
who smuggled it here.

379
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,740
- So you tortured him.

380
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,130
- Mm...

381
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,530
persuaded him.

382
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,220
Even then,
he didn't give up much.

383
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,830
Bloke swears all three drones

384
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,619
were sold to the same buyer
anonymously.

385
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,009
- Three?

386
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,659
Means there's
one more out there.

387
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,540
- Whoever's behind this
knew things they shouldn't.

388
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,110
Edwin Archer's trip to New York
was off the books, Hush-hush.

389
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,600
Very few people
knew he was coming.

390
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,720
- Okay. Why was he here?

391
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,770
- He had a board meeting
to attend.

392
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,069
- Edwin's company
is headquartered in D.C.

393
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,510
- Different board, love.

394
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
A private company.

395
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,120
- What company?

396
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,259
- Okay, so that private company
is Cyclone,

397
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,090
the tech giant in the AI wars.

398
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,016
All I know is my kids use it
for their damn homework,

399
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,480
so someone bring me up to speed.

400
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,660
- Yeah, Cyclone is
a non-profit research lab

401
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,230
developing a large-scale
artificial intelligence model.

402
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,970
They're working to insert AI
into every facet of our lives.

403
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,099
Everyone from doctors to lawyers

404
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,709
to PR firms are using it,

405
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,110
not to mention
every possible search engine.

406
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,890
- Yeah, CEO and co-founder
Scott Collins stated that

407
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,500
their mission was to create AI
that benefits humanity,

408
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,110
prioritizing transparency
and safety.

409
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,719
- Lofty goals.

410
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,006
- And hypocritical...
they're one of the most

411
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,600
notoriously secretive companies.

412
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,119
- Right.
The tech is promising,

413
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,509
but it does pose significant
safety risks,

414
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,690
threats to privacy,
copyright infringement.

415
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,169
And it's been used to generate
very sophisticated deepfakes.

416
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,236
- Right, so Edwin Archer was on
the private board of Cyclone.

417
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,260
That is why he was in town.

418
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:30,830
But more importantly,

419
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,870
was Peter Minskoff
on that same board?

420
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,196
- Well, it took long enough
to get an answer,

421
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,270
but Zinca's legal counsel
finally confirmed that

422
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,750
Peter was on the same board.

423
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,529
They were trying hard
to keep this quiet.

424
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,230
- Okay, so we have our nexus.

425
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,530
The killer is targeting
high-profile members

426
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,930
of the Cyclone board
that are here for a meeting.

427
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,280
- And there's one drone still
out there unaccounted for.

428
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,929
- Yes, so we should
round up the CEO

429
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,760
and the entire board of Cyclone.

430
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,499
And let's bring them to the one
place we know they'll be safe.

431
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,720
- Where is that?

432
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,900
- There's gotta be half a
trillion dollars in net worth

433
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,820
between those 11 people.

434
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,146
If somebody wanted
to eat the rich,

435
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,390
I'd say they found
the right menu.

436
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:14,096
What are you thinking?

437
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,920
- That we're not ready
for this fight.

438
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,530
- Technology is moving faster

439
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,399
than the bureau can prepare for.

440
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,580
It's a whole new world.

441
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,320
- And then we just
walked the next target

442
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,360
of a drone strike into 26 Fed.

443
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,300
- As the CEO of Cyclone,
I must ask

444
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,000
why you brought us all here
and confiscated our phones.

445
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,090
We've heard vague references
to a threat?

446
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,586
- Where the hell
are Peter and Edwin?

447
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,350
Why did they get a hall pass?

448
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,880
- Peter Minskoff
and Edwin Archer are dead.

449
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,400
They were both assassinated

450
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,190
in the last 24 hours
by drone strikes.

451
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,800
- A drone?
What are you talking about?

452
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
- Now, the FBI
is doing everything we can

453
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,320
to keep you safe, but
your cooperation will be vital.

454
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,240
- What are you saying?
You think we're next?

455
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,810
- We believe there
will be other attacks, yes.

456
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,290
- The bureau is outfitted
with a drone defense system

457
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,070
that's designed to disable UAPs.

458
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,926
We don't know how they're
tracking their targets yet,

459
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,560
which is why
we confiscated your phones.

460
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,210
- So this is code
for you have no idea

461
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,780
because why should you?

462
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,389
You get paid the same whether
you do the job or not.

463
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,870
You ask me, this is
government overreach.

464
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,570
Come on.

465
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,236
We're not required to stay here
like a bunch of prisoners.

466
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,439
- We need to show them
the video.

467
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,270
- Absolutely not.

468
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,309
- Okay, what video?
- This is a private board.

469
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,620
We are not compelled
to produce that video.

470
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,050
And I personally
will not be intimidated

471
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,230
by Perry's foolish theatrics.

472
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,840
- Okay.
Perry Hinton, your co-founder?

473
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,930
- Warren, we didn't take
his threat seriously

474
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,500
and now two people are dead.

475
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,150
Our friends are dead.

476
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,680
- Enough.

477
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,850
What video?

478
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,510
- Cyclone could have been
humanity's salvation,

479
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,260
but you all let greed
chart the course.

480
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,130
As your chief
technology officer,

481
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,349
I assembled a safety team
of experts

482
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,830
to oversee necessary
AI guardrails,

483
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,050
but you disbanded it.

484
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,480
I... I fought for
an ethical model,

485
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,700
and you pushed me out of
the company that I co-founded.

486
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,400
So I asked Cyclone how
to convince this board

487
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,360
to reinstate those guardrails.

488
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,149
And our own AI,

489
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,800
freed from the safety features
that I wrote,

490
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,850
suggested eliminating several
influential board members.

491
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,900
Cyclone told me how
to change your minds,

492
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,990
and even suggested the names.

493
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,560
Maybe you're on its list.

494
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,300
You know how to stop this.

495
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,519
- Okay, and... and the whole
board received this?

496
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,870
- Yesterday.

497
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,220
Perry is the leading expert
on machine learning.

498
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,586
He's clearly trying
to force the board

499
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,440
to reinstate our safety teams,

500
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,350
but I never thought
he'd go to such extremes.

501
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,010
- You and Perry
started this company

502
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,180
in your studio garage, right?

503
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,320
- Yeah, that's what we'd say
in interviews.

504
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,970
Makes for a good story.

505
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,296
Of course, I leave out the part
where our servers caught fire

506
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,890
and we lost everything.

507
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,760
And I got this.

508
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,460
Perry and I had to start over
from scratch.

509
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,379
- But you persevered.

510
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,640
- Five years ago, we launched
with zero web traffic.

511
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,080
We thought we'd sunk our lives
into a failed dream.

512
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,129
Within weeks, we had
91 million unique users.

513
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,690
And Wall Street followed.

514
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,480
- Well, with powerful investors
comes a powerful board.

515
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,739
- Each of those companies saw
how our AI could change

516
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,309
the game in their own
industries and...

517
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,100
They wanted a front-row seat.

518
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,710
- And they asked you to keep
their participation quiet.

519
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,190
- Yeah.

520
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,230
It's all changed now, but...

521
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,736
at least we still
have our studio garage

522
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,800
in Crown Heights.

523
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,720
Our North Star.

524
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,240
When the board got rid of
our safety teams, he lost it.

525
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,939
- What, threats? Violence?

526
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,600
- A strongly worded memo.

527
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,640
Perry thought he could win
their hearts and minds.

528
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,299
But they saw his concern as an
obstacle to our global profit,

529
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,740
and they ousted him
from our own company.

530
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,430
- When... when was the last time
you saw Perry?

531
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,000
- The day he was pushed out,
two weeks ago.

532
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,700
He stopped returning my calls.

533
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,479
- We need to find him
before anyone else gets hurt.

534
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,660
So do you recognize
anything from the video

535
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,630
that can help us identify
where it was recorded?

536
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,800
- I know exactly where that is.

537
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,760
- There's lights on inside.
- Looks like someone's home.

538
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,500
- Hit it.

539
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,000
- Maggie, I got something.

540
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,610
FBI!

541
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,610
Hands where we can see them.

542
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,270
FBI! Hands up!

543
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,750
- Perry Hinton?

544
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,680
- Manner of death was suicide.

545
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,826
Bullet trajectory is consistent
with self-infliction,

546
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,640
gunpowder residue
on his right hand.

547
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,046
- So there's no signs
of foul play?

548
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,590
- No. Cut and dry.

549
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,340
Algor mortis
and histomorphologic analysis

550
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,820
puts time of death
at 72 hours ago.

551
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,560
- Three days ago.

552
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,886
The drone strikes were
last night and this morning.

553
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,740
- And Perry sent his
threat video yesterday.

554
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,870
- So who's controlling the
drones if Perry's already dead?

555
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,570
Unless Perry
is somehow using his AI

556
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,349
to control the drones
postmortem.

557
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,636
- So you're saying
we're trying to stop a man

558
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,310
who died three days ago?

559
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,529
- His software doing
that on his own

560
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,960
would definitely
prove his point.

561
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,580
- How are we supposed
to stop a rogue AI?

562
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,456
- All right, I don't wanna get
in the weeds here,

563
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,802
but it appears a man you fired,
Perry Hinton,

564
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,780
is using the AI you designed
as a weapon

565
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,000
that is currently
on a killing spree

566
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,050
that the AI itself designed.

567
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,790
- To be clear, our AI tools
cannot operate for themselves.

568
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,986
- Well, technically speaking,
we don't know that, Scott.

569
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,580
- Our output analysis
says we do.

570
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,010
- So it's not
actually intelligent?

571
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,540
- A user or a developer puts
an input into the software

572
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,980
and then the software
creates an output.

573
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,070
But how it does that,
we're still not really sure.

574
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,980
- You don't know how
your own tech works?

575
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,850
That's overly simplistic.

576
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,380
- It doesn't matter.
It's an arms race.

577
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,160
Perry wanted to fight
it with muskets,

578
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,290
whereas the Chinese
and the Israelis

579
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,470
and God knows who else
are using howitzers.

580
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,390
- Well, now you're
dating yourself, Warren.

581
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,170
- AI isn't moral.
It isn't good or bad.

582
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,870
It is a tool that
in the right hands,

583
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,390
could benefit humanity
beyond our wildest dreams.

584
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,610
But if Perry set this thing
in motion,

585
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,270
he did it himself.

586
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,180
Manually. Before he died.

587
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,750
- Using your tech.

588
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,230
So do you know how
to turn it off?

589
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,099
- No.

590
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,370
I'd still need access
to Perry's dev account.

591
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,319
I don't know his passkey.

592
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,850
And Cyclone uses a custom
advanced encryption standard.

593
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,290
- Which we've made unhackable.

594
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,980
I run a cybersecurity firm.
This is why I'm on this board.

595
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,420
We tried it in testing,
and even we couldn't crack it.

596
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,380
- This thing is still active

597
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,250
and you are all in grave danger.

598
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,910
Just stay put until
I can get my arms around this.

599
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,936
- They built a monster
they can't control,

600
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,440
so it's up to us to stop it.

601
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,530
Now, I looped in the
Cybersecurity Task Force.

602
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,936
Let's stay on top of them.
All right?

603
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,139
And FAA, if so much
as a stray balloon

604
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,180
shows up in our airspace,
I wanna know about it.

605
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,686
How we doing
with Perry Hinton's laptop?

606
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,540
- Well,
it's got AES-256 encryption.

607
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,100
Accessing Perry's dev account
would take a billion years.

608
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,580
Literally.

609
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,979
- Our timeline is a little
tighter than that, Ian.

610
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,330
- I figured.

611
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,330
Luckily, the keylogger program
on his work laptop

612
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,630
is easier to hack.

613
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,369
- Keylogger, that's like a...
- Spyware, essentially.

614
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,530
Lots of tech companies use it

615
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,460
to monitor employees'
productivity.

616
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,379
Records everything
Perry ever typed,

617
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,650
and I can pull that info
and filter it.

618
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,340
Okay, that's weird.

619
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,690
- What are you looking at?

620
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,780
- According to his
keystroke history,

621
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:28,389
Perry never asked Cyclone

622
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,546
how he could get the board
to reinstate the guardrails.

623
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,790
- Wait a minute. Never?

624
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,620
- No. And he also never typed
the words "attack drones."

625
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,570
Not once.
- That's not possible.

626
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,920
In his manifesto video,

627
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,230
he said he used Cyclone
to select his targets.

628
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,670
- What... what if...

629
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,450
pull up the manifesto video
again.

630
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,500
Let's take another look.

631
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,890
What are you thinking?

632
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,100
- Well, I guess I'm thinking

633
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,290
what if this guy
isn't Perry Hinton?

634
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,810
- I checked the metadata.

635
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,850
Cyclone didn't generate
this video.

636
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,876
Perry shot it on his smartphone
in his brownstone.

637
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,419
- Yeah, okay, but maybe
it isn't the whole video

638
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,210
that's deepfaked,
just one small piece of it.

639
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,260
- Okay, yeah.

640
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,496
So what are we looking at here?

641
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,430
- A digital mask.

642
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,089
Whoever did this used Cyclone

643
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,780
to superimpose Perry's face
over their own.

644
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,610
- And alter their voice
to match.

645
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,976
We've run into deepfakes before,

646
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,789
but the AI looks flawless.

647
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,970
- Don't count humanity out
just yet.

648
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,579
Wait, pause it there.

649
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,970
Rewind it.

650
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,930
Yes, stop there.

651
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,060
See where you can see
the reflection of his hand?

652
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,850
And... yeah, right there.

653
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,540
Pause.

654
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,760
Zoom in there.

655
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,250
I've seen that burn scar before.

656
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,560
- Where's Scott?

657
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,430
- Uh, he...
he went to the bathroom.

658
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,910
- How long ago?

659
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,870
- 20 minutes, maybe.
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

660
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,520
If Scott gets to leave,
I'm going too.

661
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,830
- No, stay right here.

662
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,479
If you care about your life,
do not move.

663
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,920
- All right, eyes up.
Scott Collins is in the wind.

664
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,450
He said he was going
to the bathroom,

665
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,206
then he told security he wanted
to leave the building.

666
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,856
- What, since he was
technically a visitor,

667
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,140
they just let him go?
- Exactly.

668
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,776
He's got 20 minutes on us.
But you know what?

669
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,489
We're better, so let's find him.

670
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,930
Checking perimeter cameras.

671
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,036
- All right.
What about his cell?

672
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,240
Can we ping it?

673
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,646
- We confiscated
all the board members' phones

674
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,760
when they checked in.

675
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,956
- Right, but that's not
a bad consolation.

676
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,810
Maybe there's
something we can use.

677
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,940
- Yes, just one minute.

678
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,110
Hey, which one of these
is Scott's?

679
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,096
Good, good. Now run that
through our geo timeline.

680
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,550
Pipe that over to my station.

681
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,939
- Surveillance is up.

682
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,420
Looks like Scott
exited our main door

683
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,079
16 minutes ago and headed
northwest on Thomas Street.

684
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,689
- Okay, let's put out a BOLO,
all agencies.

685
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,080
Ian, talk to me.

686
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,016
- Well, even if AI is assisting
in the navigation,

687
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
all Bushcraft drones
require humans to launch them.

688
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,130
So assuming Scott is
returning to wherever

689
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,976
he's been stashing them...
- He'd have been there before.

690
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,936
All right, can you use the
historical data from the phone

691
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,699
to trace his movements
over the past 24 hours?

692
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,010
- Done and done.

693
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,970
- Okay, perfect.
So what do we know for sure?

694
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,646
- Well, that's Cyclone's
primary offices,

695
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,320
and that's Scott Collins' home.

696
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,690
- Okay, and what about
that spot?

697
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,120
He went there three
separate times.

698
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,686
- It's just a building
in Crown Heights.

699
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,500
- No, not just any building.

700
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,760
He's going back to where it
all began, his North Star...

701
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,460
their garage studio.

702
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,640
- Scott Collins, FBI!

703
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,290
Put your hands where
I can see them.

704
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,300
- Put the device down!

705
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,390
Slowly!

706
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,000
- You're too late.

707
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,820
Last drone's
already been launched.

708
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,480
- You need to call it back here.

709
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:27,350
- Perry and I created AI
to benefit humanity.

710
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,140
But AI is one decision away
from being weaponized.

711
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,270
- Scott, you're the one
that's killing people now.

712
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,320
- Perry spiraled
after he got fired.

713
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,670
I went to check on him,
and I found my friend.

714
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,590
Gun in his hand, dead.

715
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,460
That was when I knew
I had to honor him.

716
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,900
By forcing Cyclone back
on the right path.

717
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,600
- Hey, hey, hey.
Scott, look at me.

718
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,650
Just hand me the tablet, okay?
Hand it to me.

719
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,910
- No.

720
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,560
- You kill everybody
on your board,

721
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,676
how are you getting them to
vote the way you want them to?

722
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,480
- You still don't see it.

723
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:12,610
I don't want my board dead.

724
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,570
I wanna change their minds.

725
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,970
And Cyclone showed me
exactly how to do that.

726
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,060
This is how we save the world.

727
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,890
- No!

728
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,239
Hey, hey!

729
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,070
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

730
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,740
- Okay, our last drone
is in the air

731
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,140
and Scott knows
his board is here.

732
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,260
Let's move them into
the basement to be safe.

733
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,236
Hey, Ian, you need to monitor
the drone defense system.

734
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,960
Hey, the second you see
anything, I wanna know.

735
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,250
- BOLOs on comms, boss.
- Okay.

736
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,310
Stuart, what have
you got for me?

737
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,986
- Well, Jubal,
he won't give us a damn thing.

738
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,009
But 26 Fed is not the target.

739
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,270
- Not the board?
- No.

740
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,840
No, he needs them alive.

741
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,100
He... he wants their vote
for safety regulations.

742
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,190
- Hey, I got the drone.

743
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,890
It's traveling
at 70 miles an hour.

744
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,940
Current trajectory suggests...

745
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,590
wait, it's arching north
away from 26 Fed.

746
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,966
- Okay, so who is flying
this thing

747
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,420
if Scott broke
the damn control system?

748
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,690
- If Scott set a destination,

749
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,250
the drone would use
obstacle detection

750
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,650
and aerial surveys
to route itself there.

751
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,050
Waypoint navigation... even
basic commercial drones use it.

752
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,350
- And this one's running

753
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,689
the most advanced AI software
on the market.

754
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,000
- Okay, so where is it headed?

755
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,700
What one target could
change the board's mind?

756
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,116
- Well, easiest way
to sway the board...

757
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,010
convince the loudest
voice in the room

758
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,480
to vote the way you want.

759
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,880
Someone outspoken, entitled,
used to getting their way.

760
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,270
- Yeah, Warren Foster.

761
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,100
- He's the one who
spearheaded the vote

762
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,036
to gut the safety teams
and push Perry Hinton out.

763
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,890
- Yeah, okay,
so what kind of leverage

764
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,980
could Scott have
over Warren Foster?

765
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,760
- It's his daughter, Ashley.

766
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,916
Warren and his wife have
a second townhome in the city.

767
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,680
Ashley stays there
while she's in school.

768
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,160
She's Warren's pride and joy.

769
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,590
- I mean, that makes
a kind of awful sense, right?

770
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,030
Force Warren to
live with the fact

771
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,280
that the AI he weaponized
just killed his own daughter.

772
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,770
Call ahead, warn Ashley
we're sending a team.

773
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,170
- On it.

774
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,519
- Come on, Ashley, let's go.

775
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,430
- Is... is my dad okay?
- He's fine.

776
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,779
Get in the car.

777
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,220
Hey.
Everything's gonna be okay.

778
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,326
We're gonna keep you safe.

779
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,790
- Maggie, I see it.

780
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,570
Come on! Let's move!

781
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,840
- Did it detonate?

782
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,710
- No, it just changed course.

783
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,070
- What? How?

784
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,656
- Advanced pathfinding
is already used

785
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,160
in military drones.

786
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,956
It can be programmed
to lock onto moving targets

787
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,550
over various terrain.

788
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,486
- What are you saying, Ian,
that it's following them?

789
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,600
- If Scott told the drone its
target was inside that house

790
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,820
and the drone registered
people leaving in a vehicle,

791
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,990
Cyclone's AI system could
relay new instructions

792
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,520
and adjust the drone's
flight path.

793
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,520
- Maggie, OA, the drone
is still tracking you.

794
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,520
I repeat,
the drone is tracking you.

795
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,050
- What?

796
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,416
- You need to ditch
the vehicle and find cover.

797
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,090
You have less than, what?
- 22 seconds.

798
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,350
- You hear that? 22 seconds.

799
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,579
Someone give them a destination,

800
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,320
somewhere that
can withstand the blast.

801
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,500
- Subterranean parking garage
up on your left.

802
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,710
- Got it?

803
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,850
- I see it.

804
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,086
- Ashley, we're gonna run
for that door

805
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,350
as fast as we can, okay?
- Yeah.

806
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,810
- Now!

807
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,030
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Move!

808
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,210
- Take cover!
The drone is on your six!

809
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
Move! Move!

810
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,070
- FDNY, send everything
you have to that address.

811
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,900
FAA, I want a full lockdown
of that airspace ASAP.

812
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,990
- SERT has been notified

813
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:09,298
and is sending
all necessary assets.

814
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:11,045
- Yeah.
- Wait. What happened?

815
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,330
- Uh, Maggie and OA were

816
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,780
exfil-ing Warren Foster's
daughter,

817
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,939
but the final drone
was able to track them.

818
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,160
They took shelter in
a parking garage, but...

819
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,780
- Maggie and OA?
- Comms are still down.

820
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,340
- We lost signal
just after the explosion.

821
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,430
Our teams are en route.

822
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,360
- Everyone okay?

823
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,010
Ashley? Ashley?

824
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,360
- I'm okay.

825
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,580
I think I just got some scrapes.

826
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,970
- We're not safe here.
We gotta get out.

827
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,020
Maggie.

828
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,800
- Maggie!

829
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,979
Hey, hey, hey.

830
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,070
Maggie? Talk to me.

831
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,810
Maggie?
- Is she okay?

832
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,550
- There's no pulse.

833
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,560
She's not breathing. Come on.

834
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,180
Maggie.

835
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,710
- Oh, my God.

836
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,400
Jubal, looks like
a damn war zone down here.

837
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,450
- Yeah, we have not been able

838
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,556
to get ahold of Maggie
and OA yet.

839
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,280
FDNY is seven minutes out.

840
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,980
- How can anyone survive that?

841
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,646
If they're alive in there,
they don't have long.

842
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,420
We gotta go. Come on.

843
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,070
- Maggie! OA!

844
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,340
Can you fit?
- Yeah.

845
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,730
- Go, go, go.

846
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,300
- Maggie! OA!
- Down here!

847
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,610
- Oh, my God. What happened?

848
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,870
- The blast took us out.
Her heart stopped.

849
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,416
- Get Ashley out of here.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

850
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,830
- Quickly, quickly. Ready?

851
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,440
I got you.

852
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,620
- Jubal, I got an agent down.

853
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,230
I repeat, Jubal,
I got an agent down.

854
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,230
- Who is it, Scola?
- It's Maggie.

855
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,060
OA's doing chest compressions
right now.

856
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,110
- How much longer
until FDNY gets there?

857
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,646
- Dispatch is saying they're
still three minutes out.

858
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,330
- I want a medevac
in the air now.

859
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,476
- The chopper's pulling up now.

860
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,070
Should be there in five minutes.

861
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,070
- Scola, you get that?

862
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,509
- Yeah, yeah, I got you.

863
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,899
- It's all right.
- Five out, buddy.

864
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,900
Keep going.

865
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,780
- Come on.

866
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,870
Come on, Maggie!

867
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,170
Come on.
Come on, Maggie!

868
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,520
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

869
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,310
Hey, hey, hey.
There she is.

870
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,010
There she is. There she is.

871
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,840
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

872
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,360
- OA?
- I got you.

873
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,620
Yeah, I got you. Breathe.

874
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,280
Breathe. Just breathe.

875
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,930
- OA, what happened?

876
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,669
- You're fine. I'm with you.
I'm with you.

877
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,280
You're okay.

878
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,850
I need you to breathe.
I need you to relax, okay?

879
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,850
I got you. I'm with you.

880
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,200
Just breathe. Just breathe.

881
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:10,160
- Jubal, he got her back.

882
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,860
She's breathing.

883
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:19,300
- You have a lot of very
relieved folks back here.

884
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,170
Medevac is two out.

885
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,960
- Okay. Hey.

886
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,140
We gotta get you out of here.

887
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,530
- Okay.
- Okay?

888
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,450
- Hey.

889
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,710
What did they decide?
Did they vote?

890
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,710
- Does it really matter?

891
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:43,369
Where you're going,

892
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:45,346
you'll be lucky if they let you
read your emails once a month.

893
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,590
- It matters.

894
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,980
It's the only thing
that matters.

895
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,900
- Well, then, sad to say,
your ploy didn't work.

896
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,730
Their minds were not changed.

897
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,560
- They understood the risk,

898
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,910
but your board was not willing
to slow down your company.

899
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
- When it was just me and Perry,

900
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:12,920
we were perfect, you know?

901
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,490
We built everything together.

902
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,790
Software to protect the future.

903
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,150
And we lost our way.

904
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,160
- Okay, water, blankets,

905
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,340
more ibuprofen than
anyone should ever take.

906
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,730
Do you need anything else?

907
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,220
- OA, if you hadn't have...

908
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,090
- Don't get sappy, Maggie.

909
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,570
- Thank you.

910
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,920
- All in a day's work.

911
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,619
Oh, I got burgers from
that place you like on 6th.

912
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,620
- How? They don't even deliver.

913
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,370
- Hey.
- Hi. There she is.

914
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,720
- Hey, Maggie.

915
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,046
- I'm not sure if
you're allowed to drink,

916
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,200
but the rest of us
could definitely use one.

917
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,420
- I'll grab us some plates.

918
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,720
- We don't need plates.

919
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,550
We need glasses.

920
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,860
- What did you do?

921
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,860
- I know you think
you should be alone.

922
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,260
You can't get rid of us
that easy.

923
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,970
Thanks.
