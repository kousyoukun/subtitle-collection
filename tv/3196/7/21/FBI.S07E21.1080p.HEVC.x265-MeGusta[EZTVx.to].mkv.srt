1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,286
<i>7 million strong,</i>

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,726
<i>marching shoulder to
shoulder with Calvin.</i>

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,596
<i>Jed "Duke" ducoyle's
an extremist pundit</i>

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,816
<i>with millions of followers.</i>

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,116
<i>This is a grift.</i>

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,386
<i>Calvin's an anonymous
online conspiracy theorist.</i>

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,296
<i>Think q but somehow
more extreme.</i>

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,816
So Calvin posts five words.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,346
Duke decodes it.

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,476
He's directing people
to kill in the real world.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,916
- I don't recognize...
- I don't recognize...

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,306
I don't recognize
your authority.

13
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,526
<i>People are dead because of you.</i>

14
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,526
Calvin posted all the intel.

15
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,226
You know, this conversation
would go a lot smoother

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,926
if you would just admit
that you are Calvin.

17
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,170
Don't move!

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,560
<i>We have a shooter.</i>

19
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,586
Now we just have to
prove Duke drove him to kill.

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,050
He trusted that... that I
could get the job done.

21
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,156
Jed ducoyle, you
are under arrest.

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,140
You've accomplished
nothing by arresting me today.

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,970
<i>Get prepared, 'cause
a war is coming,</i>

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,020
<i>and Calvin's ready to fight.</i>

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,996
- My god.
- You should have seen it.

26
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,500
She hit the fadeaway jumper,
half second left on the clock!

27
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,396
Thing of beauty.

28
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,226
Sounds like the basketball
hoop in the backyard's

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,600
- working out.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,096
Paint me a proud dad.

31
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,040
What do you think?

32
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,016
You got to be kidding
me with this thing.

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,666
Right? Best cannoli
I have ever tasted.

34
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,236
And my nonna's from sicily,
so that's saying something.

35
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,846
That makes this a real tragedy.

36
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,586
I take no joy in putting
this place six feet under,

37
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,206
but you don't pay what
you owe, things get ugly.

38
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,320
You about done?

39
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,556
Man, I hope they don't cry.

40
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,190
I hate it when they cry.

41
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,900
We need to talk to the owner.

42
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,606
Carolyn Eugene, head of
the New York IRS field office.

43
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,606
Agent bell. This is agent zidan.

44
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,916
I'm sorry to hear
about your guys.

45
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,836
Yeah, it's a... Hell
of a call to get.

46
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,836
Hank tamburello died on
scene of multiple stab wounds

47
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,040
from an unknown assailant.

48
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,106
His partner, Russell
kreider, tried to intervene,

49
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,740
was stabbed right over here,
died en route to the hospital.

50
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,286
Both of my guys
were special agents

51
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,636
with our criminal
investigation division.

52
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,026
Assuming there were
multiple witnesses.

53
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,140
Half the breakfast crowd.

54
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,766
My guys were here for an audit.

55
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,530
Business had been
underreporting, hiding money.

56
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,646
Guy must have
been waiting for them

57
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,386
jumped off his bike,
came in, started stabbing.

58
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,296
The owner know that
your guys were coming?

59
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,776
Maybe they were
prepared to fight back.

60
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,306
No.

61
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,940
No, owner had no idea.

62
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,290
NYPD get a description?

63
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,810
Guy had a motorcycle helmet on

64
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,730
dragon logo, full leathers,
visor kept their face hidden.

65
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,276
Medium build, sped
off around that corner.

66
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,836
They had the
knife in their hand,

67
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,056
according to multiple witnesses.

68
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,406
Okay, we'll get the joc

69
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,926
to run all the security
cameras in the area.

70
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,366
We'll find this guy.

71
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,806
We're here, and we're
going to do everything we can.

72
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,660
Thank you.

73
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,416
- Here's your oat latte.
- Amazing.

74
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,530
Thank you.

75
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,180
Excuse me.

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,916
We good here?

77
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,510
Yeah, Patrick, I'm good. Thanks.

78
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,326
Okay, so, earlier today,

79
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,130
IRS special agents
Hank tamburello

80
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,676
and Russell kreider were victims

81
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,246
of a brutal knife
attack in little Italy.

82
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,506
Both tamburello and
kreider died of their wounds.

83
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,230
These men were
federal agents just like us.

84
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,126
So, come hell or high water,
we are going to get them justice.

85
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,386
Agreed?

86
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,166
How we doing with surveillance?

87
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,126
Ert combed the area
for security cameras.

88
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,346
This is right across
from the café.

89
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,916
Okay.

90
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,346
Yeah, yeah, can we zoom
in on the mystery perp's bike?

91
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,176
- Plates or...?
- No can do.

92
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,810
Our suspect used a plate flipper

93
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,420
to conceal their license number,

94
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,396
and the helmet
prevented any facial rec.

95
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,470
But if you look
close, there is a decal

96
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,356
- of a dragon logo on the back.
- All right.

97
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,236
You guys want to
run with that image,

98
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,740
see what you can chase down?

99
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,366
Should stick to street cams,
see what else you can find.

100
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,716
You're profiling the victims.

101
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,716
Any enemies?
Long-standing grudges?

102
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,236
Well, both men
were special agents

103
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,976
in the IRS's criminal
investigation division.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,116
Right, of course, they
worked major financial crimes

105
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,026
fraud, money laundering...

106
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,596
Tamburello put away
over 80 criminals

107
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,816
on various charges.

108
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,466
Could be motive there.

109
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,256
Right, so no
shortage of suspects

110
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,520
who might want to see him dead.

111
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,630
Maybe this was a
hired assassination.

112
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,566
Wait a minute. Got something.

113
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,996
Yeah? What? Show me.

114
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,786
71 seconds later,
our biker reappears.

115
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,680
But notice anything missing?

116
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,086
Let me get in
closer on the image.

117
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,396
- His pockets are empty, meaning there's...
- No weapon.

118
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,746
Must have ditched it between
this place and the café.

119
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,990
Good work. Get a team out there.

120
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,456
Knife attacks are
pretty rare in the U.S.

121
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
They only account for
one out of ten homicides.

122
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,440
To brutally stab two people...

123
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,360
Yeah, in broad
daylight in a busy café.

124
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,376
I don't know. This
one feels personal.

125
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,360
Yeah, or targeted.

126
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,036
Ooh, winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

127
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,670
Look at this.

128
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,686
We should be able to
get some DNA off of that.

129
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,956
Yeah. Look at that etching.

130
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,006
Well, that's a bit bolder
than I was expecting.

131
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,820
Yeah, according
to the ert report,

132
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,940
no fingerprints, but, let's
take a look at the design

133
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,576
- etched on the blade.
- Yeah.

134
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,226
It's called a maker's
Mark. It's like a signature.

135
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,446
Okay, yeah, we got a hit.

136
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,496
That's the hallmark
for ivar asghari.

137
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,412
He's a local bladesmith
working out of greenpoint.

138
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:32,066
Asghari's social media accounts

139
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,960
are full of libertarian
anti-tax sentiment.

140
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,506
We thinking the knife
maker hates the taxman?

141
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,546
Guy's got a rap
sheet half a block long

142
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,570
mostly drugs, resisting arrest.

143
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,670
I'd say it's time to pay
this bladesmith a visit.

144
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,606
Ivar asghari? FBI.

145
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,776
Appointment only.
And it's ee-var.

146
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,876
Did you like
something on my site,

147
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,510
or you want something custom?

148
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,706
Did you hear us? We're the FBI.

149
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,096
Not a little curious as to
what we're doing here?

150
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,146
Well, I'm not going
to incriminate myself.

151
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,236
What an incredibly
incriminating thing to say.

152
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,496
Two men were brutally stabbed

153
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,440
with a knife that was made here.

154
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,896
- Who bought it?
- You got a warrant?

155
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,880
If you'd like, we can
head down to 26 fed,

156
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,506
have this conversation
in the interrogation room.

157
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,806
I'm not legally obligated

158
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,530
to tell you anything
about my customers.

159
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,296
All right, call the
joc, get the warrant.

160
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,426
We're gonna tear
this place apart.

161
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,580
What?

162
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,906
Well, your personal maker's Mark

163
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,076
was on the steel of
the murder weapon.

164
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,166
So we're just gonna assume

165
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,646
that you were the
last one to use it.

166
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,606
We need to expedite
the search warrant

167
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,850
for ivar asghari,
suspicion of murder.

168
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,476
Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Hold on, hold on.

169
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,980
- I sold that knife.
- To who?

170
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,226
I got it right here.

171
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,780
Name is Sandra longo.

172
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,496
All right, joc just
sent over the file.

173
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,326
She operates heavy machinery.

174
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,830
She has no priors,

175
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,506
and she's not connected
to any of the victims.

176
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,010
Yeah, something's not adding up.

177
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,466
The IRS criminal division

178
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,090
usually goes after
corrupt billionaires,

179
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,286
not blue-collar workers.

180
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,050
She's not right for this.

181
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,950
Well, maybe she can
lead us to whoever is.

182
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,256
Is that her?

183
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,346
Sandra.

184
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,460
Hey, Sandra!

185
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,736
- Turn it off!
- Sorry. What do you need?

186
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,216
We're the FBI.

187
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,320
I'm special agent bell.
This is special agent zidan.

188
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,486
Look, can you come down here?

189
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,577
We have a few questions for you.

190
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:28,616
Is there a problem?

191
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,706
Where were you this
morning before you clocked in?

192
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,040
Why?

193
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,226
Two men were murdered
in Brooklyn this morning.

194
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,576
The weapon used was this knife.

195
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,446
We were able to
track it back to you.

196
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,716
That... yeah, that was mine,

197
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,196
but I gave it to a consignment
shop a while back.

198
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,740
I can get you the name of
the place if you give me a sec.

199
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,636
No, no, no. Hold
on. Is that your bike?

200
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,050
- What?
- Your bike.

201
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,050
No, that's my boyfriend's. Why?

202
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,256
Okay, we need you to get down.

203
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,980
Yeah, get down
right now. Come on.

204
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,240
Hey!

205
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,836
Sandra longo, hands up!

206
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,276
You're under arrest for the
murder of two federal agents.

207
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,910
Drop the phone.

208
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,936
We can tie the murder
weapon back to you.

209
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,766
Also, your motorcycle
helmet is identical

210
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,360
to the one used
by today's assailant.

211
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,206
So, tell us, why did you
target Hank tamburello

212
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,856
and Russell kreider?

213
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,450
I don't recognize
your authority.

214
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,996
Okay, here's what's
gonna happen next.

215
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,046
You will be put at the
scene, and we will charge you

216
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,120
with first-degree murder
of two federal agents.

217
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,770
I don't get it.

218
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,536
You're getting stellar
performance reviews at work.

219
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,966
Your manager said
that you were on track

220
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,056
to be promoted within the year.

221
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,340
Why throw all that away?
What's this really about?

222
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,546
<i>I don't recognize
your authority.</i>

223
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,750
Well, that sounds familiar.

224
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,130
Yeah, I wanted to make sure,

225
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,376
so I got the joc to
pull these interviews.

226
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,856
<i>I don't recognize
your authority.</i>

227
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,286
Remember that's
all they would say

228
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,986
after they attacked the
greenwich monument?

229
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,816
Yeah, because
they're Calvin followers.

230
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,596
I can't believe there
are still people who think

231
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,426
there's a highly-placed
fed named Calvin

232
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,760
leaking classified information.

233
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,826
There are, but I thought
we silenced Calvin.

234
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,516
We did. The Calvin
account has been radio silent

235
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,150
for the last few months.

236
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,736
Then yesterday...

237
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,046
A new post on the
forums that reads,

238
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,136
"beware the brewing tempest."

239
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,420
We're not going to
play this game again.

240
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,226
Everybody knows
there is no Calvin.

241
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,380
It's Duke.

242
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,536
Duke ducoyle is the
one behind the mask.

243
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,080
He's the one decoding
the messages,

244
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,846
raking in the cash from all
of his brainwashed followers.

245
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,536
I am telling you right
now, Duke is behind this,

246
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,610
and I want to know how.

247
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,076
Isobel.

248
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,636
You okay?

249
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,246
Yeah.

250
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,166
I should have seen this coming.

251
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,320
Duke's trial for inciting
violence starts next month.

252
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,476
It's got to be related.

253
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,126
Duke's cocky, but he's smart.

254
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,566
You really think
that he would risk

255
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,306
violating the terms of his bond?

256
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,720
That doesn't track.

257
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,746
People have been following me.

258
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,250
What?

259
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,366
It started when I
went after Duke.

260
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,326
Like, I would... I
would feel them

261
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,220
standing behind me, watching.

262
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,636
You know, just today in
my coffee shop, this creep

263
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,490
he just stood there,
blocking my way like a pillar.

264
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,206
- What'd he say to you?
- Nothing.

265
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,116
He didn't have to.

266
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,060
I mean, the Calvin account
didn't mention me by name,

267
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,596
so can I prove
that it's Duke? No.

268
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,060
But they're only getting bolder.

269
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,346
I brought the issue
to adic Reynolds.

270
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,346
He assigned me and
Phillip a security detail.

271
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,070
I'm sorry.

272
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,696
This stuff can mess
with your head.

273
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,436
And you really can talk
to me about these things.

274
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,576
Maggie, I am your sac.

275
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,666
And I'm your friend.

276
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,406
You know, we need to
take Duke down for good.

277
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,106
I'm going to pay
that little snake a visit.

278
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,366
There he is.

279
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,610
- Not interested.
- We got a warrant.

280
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,856
Move.

281
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,686
So why'd you order Sandra
longo to murder two IRS agents?

282
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,726
I think we've done
this dance before,

283
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,946
and I'm a little busy right now.

284
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,240
Duke, is that a finger?

285
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,950
It is, but it's not
what it looks like.

286
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,056
Duke, whose finger is it?

287
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,836
- Obviously not yours.
- I have no interest

288
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,366
in dragging the
deep state into this.

289
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,106
Well, we're here,

290
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,276
and whatever that is
doing there now involves us,

291
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,236
so start talking.

292
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,066
My wife, trishelle,
disappeared two days ago.

293
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,490
Last night her finger showed
up on my doorstep, so...

294
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,856
I put it on ice, you
know, just in case.

295
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,986
Why wouldn't you call the FBI?

296
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,126
The FBI?

297
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,850
The U.S. attorney is already
giving me a free colonoscopy,

298
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,256
thanks to you.

299
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,330
Last thing I need are more feebs

300
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,996
tromping mud all over my brand.

301
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,266
Just tell us what happened.

302
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,990
Trishelle went to
hot yoga on Tuesday,

303
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,486
like always, but she
didn't come home.

304
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,056
When she wasn't back
by dinner, I got nervous.

305
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,836
And then she calls.

306
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,926
I answer it, but it's not her.

307
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,716
It's a gravelly voice.

308
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,016
This guy says,
"I have your wife."

309
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,156
"Await further
instructions." Click.

310
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,676
I call back, but her phone's
gone to voicemail ever since.

311
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,686
And then her finger arrived.

312
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,246
In a Manila envelope,
wrapped in two-ply.

313
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,726
Hey, you got security cameras?

314
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,076
Maybe we can see
who dropped it off.

315
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,866
Security cameras?
They steal your data.

316
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,306
It's like installing your
own personal narc.

317
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,866
Okay.

318
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,876
And the kidnappers, what
were their demands? Money?

319
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,820
I go to trial next month.

320
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,160
I'd like assurances that any
statement I make here today...

321
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,316
Will not be used against
me in a court of law.

322
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,496
- Duke.
- You had no idea...

323
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,186
What was going on
before you got here,

324
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,886
and I'm not in cuffs.

325
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,350
So you need me for something.

326
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,546
Fine, we'll recommend
that your statement

327
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,676
isn't used against you, in
the interest of public safety.

328
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,816
Now, what did the
kidnappers want?

329
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,126
They demanded my
password to the Calvin account.

330
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,336
Your password.

331
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,906
So you're finally admitting

332
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,296
that you were posting
as Calvin all along?

333
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,306
Yes. Who cares?

334
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,126
It's immaterial!
It doesn't matter!

335
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,980
What matters is,
they're holding my wife!

336
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,640
- We can't trust Duke ducoyle.
- The man is a professional liar.

337
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,666
- He's working an angle.
- Yeah. No, no, agreed.

338
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,846
Look, I-I know we... we all want
to connect this back to Duke,

339
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,416
but so far, we've
found zero connection

340
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,180
between him and our
two dead IRS agents.

341
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,856
I mean, look, i-i...

342
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,946
I want to see this guy go
down as badly as anyone,

343
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,206
but it looks like he has
no motive to lie here.

344
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,166
Okay, let's say Duke
is telling the truth.

345
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,956
Someone new is running
the Calvin account,

346
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,110
which means that person
can use the account

347
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,330
to communicate with
7 million loyal followers.

348
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,566
Yeah, so... How is the
new Calvin communicating

349
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,770
with Sandra longo?

350
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,860
That's the question.

351
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,470
He got Sandra longo
to carry out a specific hit.

352
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,666
Well, we've... we've
scoured her 4chan,

353
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,756
her discord accounts...
nothing so far.

354
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,626
We are missing something.

355
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,976
The me just confirmed
the severed finger

356
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,986
did belong to trishelle ducoyle.

357
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,336
So that supports Duke's story.

358
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,450
We've got to figure out how
to get Sandra to start talking.

359
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,516
Although if I have to hear

360
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,996
"I do not recognize your
authority" one more time...

361
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,866
You know, Sandra longo

362
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,216
she may not
recognize our authority,

363
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,956
but we happen to have
one of her idols in custody

364
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,996
the high priest of calvinism.

365
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,030
Duke ducoyle.

366
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,616
Before we go any further,

367
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,406
I'd like to address the
elephant in the room.

368
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,536
I missed you, too.

369
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,056
I know that you have been
sending your sycophants

370
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,186
to stalk me and my family.

371
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,016
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

372
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,456
This little game of yours

373
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,456
it is not gonna work forever.

374
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,920
I'm joining you in there.

375
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,456
I can get this
calvinite to talk,

376
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,090
but not with a deep-state
fed hovering over my shoulder.

377
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,970
You're everything
these people despise.

378
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,906
Thanks to your
propaganda. Follow me.

379
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,466
That woman in
there has information

380
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,996
that could lead us to your wife,

381
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,476
so there is no way in hell

382
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,046
I am leaving you in
there unsupervised.

383
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,420
All right. Better let
me do the talking.

384
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,876
- My god. Duke ducoyle?
- The one and only.

385
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,496
I-I've watched every
episode of "the path."

386
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,130
Thank you.

387
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,326
Wait, what are you
doing here with them?

388
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,976
Calvin has friends everywhere.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,506
The real question, Sandra,
is, can we trust you?

390
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,156
Of course.

391
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,636
I-I've been following
Calvin from day zero.

392
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,206
I'm a true believer.

393
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,750
Good, because Calvin
might be in trouble.

394
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,450
And we need your help.

395
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,776
Did Calvin ever ask you
to go after anyone else?

396
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,280
Maybe that woman?

397
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,746
No.

398
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,560
He only contacted me about
the IRS agent, tamburello.

399
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,926
Wait, he contacted
you? Only you?

400
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,226
Yeah. He chose me.

401
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,380
Calvin... he doesn't
take chances.

402
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,406
He's careful. Why
did he choose you?

403
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,326
Because he knows
that I'm ready to fight.

404
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,016
I've been here since
the very first drop.

405
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,366
He knows I'm loyal.

406
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,196
Well, if that's true,
how did he contact you?

407
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,960
Through a new app.

408
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,206
Calvin messaged me privately.

409
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,726
He said there was this
deep-state detractor

410
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,410
causing him problems,
threatening to ruin everything.

411
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,346
But he said that I was the
warrior that could save him.

412
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,866
What app?

413
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,346
Okay, so Sandra just gave up
her method of communication

414
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,136
with the new Calvin plumage

415
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,566
some social media
app for birders

416
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,306
that has a hidden
encrypted messaging feature.

417
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,746
Yeah, should have known.

418
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,186
That app can't tell
the difference between

419
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,616
a blue warbler
and a house Finch.

420
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,016
It's whac-a-mole with these
illicit communication apps.

421
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,666
Shut one down, a
new one pops up.

422
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,536
But if the app exists,
we can get into it, right?

423
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,240
Has the dive team
recovered Sandra's phone

424
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,756
so we can scrape its data?

425
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,286
Yeah, but it still needs to
be cleaned and dried out

426
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,806
- before we can exploit it.
- Hey, good news...

427
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,506
Sandra's plumage account
is synced to the app's cloud.

428
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,506
- Downloading all of her dms.
- Really?

429
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,710
Okay, here we
go. Let's see here.

430
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,906
There, that avatar is
the same one Calvin uses

431
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,296
on the other accounts.

432
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,760
Here we go... "my
devoted warrior",

433
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,200
"a deep-state detractor

434
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,736
"could cost us everything
we've fought for.

435
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,216
"Silence an IRS agent
named Hank tamburello

436
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,460
in the name of justice."

437
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,956
Yeah, it doesn't get
any clearer than that.

438
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,240
He even gave her tamburello's
home and work addresses.

439
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,786
Can we try Calvin's
account on the bird app,

440
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,810
get a location on where
he sent the messages from?

441
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,056
Yeah, pulling 5g data from
plumage's mobile back end.

442
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,666
Triangulating tcp
and udp endpoints.

443
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,756
Calvin sent his messages
from an abandoned storefront

444
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,066
on Apollo street.

445
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,270
Freeze!

446
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,050
Got a runner.

447
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,636
Suspect got away.

448
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,866
Trishelle. It's okay.

449
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,516
It'll be okay. I got you.

450
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,126
You're safe now.

451
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,136
All right, so trishelle ducoyle

452
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,226
has been recovered... her
kidnapper remains at large.

453
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,926
"Oa describes a 6'3"
white male, beard,

454
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,576
jeans, and a brown jacket,
last seen heading south.

455
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,326
Okay, check cameras
within a four-block radius.

456
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,130
None are working
in that vicinity.

457
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,716
We're expanding our search.

458
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,676
Jubal, Calvin just
posted a new message.

459
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,506
- He... this one is live.
- What?

460
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,450
<i>Hue and cry, <i>Calvin
stands before you.</i>

461
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,686
<i>To my loyal warriors,
rattle the cages.</i>

462
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,150
<i>Be loud. Be known.</i>

463
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,776
<i>Make them fear us.</i>

464
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,330
And to the FBI cabal who
just tried to capture me

465
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
and thwart our greater mission,

466
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,656
<i>you listen to my words,
and you listen very closely.</i>

467
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,470
<i>Release the greenwich 41</i>

468
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,136
<i>those righteous soldiers
who were unlawfully detained</i>

469
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,486
<i>outside the greenwich
national monument.</i>

470
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,380
<i>You release them from your
custody by 2:00 P.M. today.</i>

471
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:47,520
<i>Or... <i>Tomorrow your
deep-state puppets... <i>Will die.</i>

472
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,516
The greenwich
riot was a disgrace.

473
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,906
41 of Calvin's most
strident followers

474
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,736
showed up at his command.

475
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,866
NYPD were injured,
federal property destroyed.

476
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,526
Our own agents were
attacked and assaulted.

477
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,832
Now, make no mistake

478
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:13,916
we are not releasing
the greenwich 41.

479
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,046
But whoever gained
control of the Calvin account

480
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,720
has made their demands clear

481
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,536
release the 41, or two more
deep-state puppets will die.

482
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,576
Well, that is not
going to happen,

483
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,056
because we're
going to stop this.

484
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,186
Right now, the 41 are being held

485
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,666
at the mullin detention center.

486
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,456
Their joint trial is
set to start this week.

487
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,676
Which explains the timing
and urgency of the threat.

488
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,676
So who is the new
Calvin targeting?

489
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,856
Who are these two deep-state
puppets in his crosshairs?

490
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,896
Government employees, no doubt.

491
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,766
There are a dozen
agencies active on this case,

492
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,050
including our own people.

493
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,466
- Could be anyone.
- Right.

494
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,906
Our best lead is
Duke ducoyle's wife,

495
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,126
but she's elected not
to answer any questions.

496
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,046
I know how to make her talk.

497
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,316
- <i>Doctor Carter...
- You again.</i>

498
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,136
I'm here to see my wife.

499
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,406
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. This isn't a free visit.

500
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,056
She's not giving us the
information that we need.

501
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,576
Yeah, trishelle won't talk
to you unless I'm there.

502
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,146
- We know.
- She saw her kidnapper.

503
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,870
We need to find out who that is.

504
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,180
Fine. Let's go.

505
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,010
Baby love, I was a
wreck without you.

506
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,476
I didn't want them
here either, believe me.

507
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,646
Just answer their questions,
and they'll be gone.

508
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,996
Mrs. Ducoyle, again,

509
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,826
we are trying to
identify your abductor.

510
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,640
Anything you remember
could help us out right now.

511
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,746
I don't recognize
your authority.

512
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,006
Trish, it's okay. Just
tell them what you know.

513
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,746
And I don't recognize you.

514
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,536
Babe, enough.

515
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,870
No.

516
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,080
You used to care about
the deeper mission, Duke.

517
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,666
You were the king.

518
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,976
And then you gave it all
up. You just walked away.

519
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,766
Trishelle, I'm being
prosecuted by the state.

520
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,856
I thought we were both devoted

521
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,896
to Calvin, to his cause.

522
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,026
I thought you would be excited
to know that he chose me

523
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,336
me, Duke... to be a part
of something greater.

524
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,996
He cut off your finger.

525
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,630
I gave it to him!

526
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,266
Calvin needed a sacrifice,
he said, to free the 41.

527
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,486
And I was more
than happy to help.

528
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,746
What are you talking about?

529
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,656
This is war, Duke!

530
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,056
You used to know that!

531
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,056
Calvin told me you'd gone soft,

532
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,276
that you'd lost
the will to fight.

533
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,626
I didn't want to believe him.

534
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,480
I am Calvin, Trish!

535
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,660
I am! I invented him!

536
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,870
This other guy is
nothing but an impostor.

537
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,830
Calvin told me you'd say that.

538
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,700
Just tell us about
your kidnapper.

539
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,100
Or what?

540
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,320
I pity you, Duke.

541
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,256
You're asleep, and
you don't even know it.

542
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,736
Calvin is ready for war.

543
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,306
He was even willing to
punish the deep-state detractor

544
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,380
who was living in his midst.

545
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,720
What are you willing to
sacrifice for our cause?

546
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,446
What happened to you?

547
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,356
All right.

548
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,770
So we are down the rabbit
hole on this one, folks.

549
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,846
Trishelle ducoyle believes
the man who kidnapped her

550
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,050
was the real Calvin.

551
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,146
Be that as it may, she did
say something that might help

552
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,546
that Calvin punished

553
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,326
a deep-state detractor
living in his midst.

554
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,246
The message Calvin sent
from his account to Sandra longo

555
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,856
referred to agent tamburello
as a deep-state detractor.

556
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,296
Right, but the... the "living
in his midst," the new part

557
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,370
so is tamburello someone
our guy works with,

558
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,646
someone he sees every day?

559
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,930
Maybe he's someone
from the neighborhood.

560
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,916
Hey, check this out.

561
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,600
So here are the residents
of Hank tamburello's building.

562
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,266
Now, if we cross-reference
them with the families

563
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,136
connected to the greenwich
41, we might find a nexus.

564
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,940
Aha, here we go.

565
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,186
Rob Whitfield.

566
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,846
- Would you believe it?
- What? This is a neighbor?

567
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,236
They live across the
hall from each other.

568
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,756
Really? Okay.

569
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,196
And he's 6'3". He's got a beard.

570
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,106
He matches the description
of the guy oa ran into.

571
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,390
What do we know about him?

572
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,580
Rob Whitfield is a
software engineer.

573
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,546
No priors.

574
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,766
He's posted some
conspiratorial nonsense online,

575
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,426
but other than
that, no red flags.

576
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,336
Right, but he's got a
connection to the 41, right?

577
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,336
- What is it?
- His brother was one of them.

578
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,646
Chris Whitfield was arrested
that day at the monument.

579
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,566
He attacked a police
officer with a pipe.

580
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,696
And tamburello lives
10 feet from this guy?

581
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,176
That's right.

582
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,086
If you're so inclined,
that sounds a hell of a lot

583
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,786
like a deep-state
detractor living in his midst.

584
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,576
It's a hell of a way to
deal with a neighbor.

585
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,356
We need to ask Rob
Whitfield some questions.

586
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,560
Get a team to his house.

587
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,146
FBI!

588
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,620
Clear.

589
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,386
Okay, so if Hank tamburello

590
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,590
lived across the hall
from Rob Whitfield...

591
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,816
Thin walls.

592
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,710
So did he hear or see
something suspicious,

593
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,956
Rob got nervous
and had him killed?

594
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,980
I don't know. Come look at this.

595
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,340
Rob was following
all of the arrests

596
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,006
and pretrial motions of the
greenwich 41 prosecution.

597
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,730
Look, here's his brother, Chris.

598
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,716
So did Rob figure out
what we knew all along...

599
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,886
Duke ducoyle was
running the Calvin account?

600
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,716
Maybe he thought that if
he took over the account,

601
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,806
he could use it to his advantage

602
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,270
and help free his brother.

603
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,750
Check this out.

604
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,636
The way he was saying
the U.S. attorney that are

605
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,246
leading the prosecution
against the greenwich 41

606
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,296
if something happens
to them, that's a mistrial.

607
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,776
Deep-state puppets.

608
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,516
- Jubal?
- Yeah, Maggie?

609
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,516
Hey, you need to
call the courthouse.

610
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,800
Warn the U.S. attorneys
they're the next targets.

611
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,186
See justice done!
Release the 41!

612
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,316
They could just be protesters.

613
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,666
Or Rob Whitfield could
have used the Calvin account

614
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,846
to turn one of them
into an assassin.

615
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,976
Or he's here
hiding in the crowd.

616
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,976
Release the 41!

617
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,756
Jubal, don't let the
prosecution team exit

618
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,326
through the front entrance.

619
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,546
Take them to the side
door. We'll meet them there.

620
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,506
- Let's go.
- See justice done!

621
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,766
Okay, give me a status
on the courthouse.

622
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,896
I'm on with the U.S. marshals.

623
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,246
The attorneys are
aware of the threat.

624
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,466
They were about to exit
through the front door

625
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,800
but saw the crowd gathering.

626
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,206
Yeah, let's have them
exit the east-side door.

627
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,386
They'll wait for our signal.

628
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,606
Maggie and oa will
be waiting outside.

629
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,940
- Copy.
- NYPD,

630
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,426
you're circulating Rob
Whitfield's photo, right?

631
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,970
Good, okay.

632
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,200
How we doing with the
courthouse cameras?

633
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,160
Looking for anyone we can
ID, someone with a weapon.

634
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,730
Okay, jubal, area's
clear. Send 'em out now.

635
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,276
<i>- Okay, stand by.
- Here they come.</i>

636
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,456
U.S. attorney
harrington, with me.

637
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,846
Hurry up, you guys. Go.

638
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,310
- Stay close.
- Quickly.

639
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,726
Gun!

640
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,970
Down! Get down!

641
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,076
- Go! Go, go, go!
- Stay down. Take cover.

642
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,670
Down! Get down!

643
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,590
Marshal down. Send medical.

644
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,730
Is it him?

645
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,226
No.

646
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,886
Jubal, suspect is down,
but it's not Rob Whitfield.

647
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,926
I repeat... not Rob Whitfield.

648
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,796
We need to round
up the protesters.

649
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,820
He still might be out here.

650
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,920
Okay, what do we know about
our shooter at the courthouse?

651
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,830
His name is Theo haynes.

652
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,376
Calvin reached out to him
through the birdwatching app.

653
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,986
This is their exchange.

654
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,386
Calvin all but ordered him to
assassinate the prosecutors

655
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,590
to disrupt the trial.

656
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,606
It turns out Theo haynes's wife

657
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,436
is one of the greenwich 41,
so he was personally motivated.

658
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,126
And now his wife's a widow.

659
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,396
What do we know about
the other protesters?

660
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,616
NYPD rounded them up, but
Rob Whitfield wasn't on site.

661
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,006
He's still in the wind.

662
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,836
Which means he
still has the power

663
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,746
to mobilize more calvinites
to do his dirty work.

664
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,966
He just posted a
new Calvin message.

665
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,146
- Let's take a look.
- Okay, eyes up, folks.

666
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,186
"A hundred strong assemble.

667
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:27,236
Themis has failed
so jugheads must fall."

668
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,650
Okay, so we stopped Rob's
plan to disrupt his brother's trial.

669
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,766
He's obviously pivoting to
plan b, so what does this mean?

670
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,336
It's deeply coded
in calvinite language.

671
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,190
I'll get cybercrimes
up here to take a look.

672
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,620
No.

673
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,110
It's gonna take too long.

674
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,736
What am I, your
cleanup crew now?

675
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,996
Well, when you're in the streets

676
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,566
and you need
backup, you call SWAT.

677
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,616
Up here, you call
the assistant director.

678
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,966
I also answer to "boss"
and in some circles "rabbi."

679
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,270
Yeah, well, where we're going,

680
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,406
we'd be better
off with a priest.

681
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,016
Let me get this straight.

682
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,536
You're prosecuting me for
interpreting Calvin's messages,

683
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,976
and now you're here
begging me to interpret

684
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,106
one of Calvin's messages?

685
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,766
You are being prosecuted
for inciting violence,

686
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,156
and you know that.

687
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,230
Still, the irony is delicious.

688
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,026
We are asking for your
cooperation one more time.

689
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,726
As your agents know,
I don't work for free.

690
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,386
Look, I understand your wife
is still having a tough time.

691
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,646
You can help us catch
the guy who hurt her.

692
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,280
Yeah, I'm less motivated
by that than I once was.

693
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,720
Then consider it
a public service.

694
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,290
You tell us what
the message means

695
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,980
and stop violence
before it spreads.

696
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,176
Who is he?

697
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,656
I'm the assistant director

698
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,070
in charge of the
New York field office.

699
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,056
Cool!

700
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,170
What's it going to
take to get you onside?

701
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,650
You think I want to make
a deal with a fake-news,

702
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,520
low-life short-timer? I don't.

703
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,050
But innocent lives are
at stake, are they not?

704
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,060
I want full immunity from
all federal prosecution

705
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,856
related to the greenwich
monument riots.

706
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,776
We'll ensure the
Attorney General's office

707
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,866
- makes that happen.
- Peachy.

708
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,606
Should we shake on it or

709
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,956
just tell us what the
damn message means.

710
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,866
Calvinites speak to each other

711
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,290
in, coded language,
memes, online gobbledygook.

712
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,656
But if you know, you know.

713
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,656
"A hundred strong assemble.

714
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,616
Themis has failed
so jugheads must fall."

715
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,796
It's a call to arms for soldiers

716
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,016
to liberate the greenwich 41.

717
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,066
"Jug" is slang for prison.

718
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,586
"Themis" is the Greek
goddess of justice.

719
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,456
Justice failed.

720
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,976
So they're going to break in,

721
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,896
and they're going to free
their brothers and sisters

722
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,140
- before the trial.
- When?

723
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,896
You got to do
some work yourself.

724
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,310
- When?
- I don't know.

725
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,800
It's not in here.

726
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,736
Could be tomorrow,
could be tonight,

727
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,866
could be right
now, for all I know.

728
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,516
But whoever shows
up, according to this

729
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,540
they're going to be looking
for a righteous donnybrook.

730
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:13,720
See justice done!
Release the 41!

731
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,910
Jubal, it's a powder
keg over here.

732
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,196
Yeah, SWAT's right behind you!

733
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,986
Release the 41!

734
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,140
See justice done!
Release the 41!

735
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,710
Freeze! Freeze!

736
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,250
See justice done!
Release the 41!

737
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,136
This doesn't make any sense.

738
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,182
Nobody's ever broken into
a federal detention center.

739
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:53,486
- This plan isn't gonna work.
- Right, right.

740
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,966
So... so why would Rob send
his Calvin followers to try it?

741
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,270
It's got to be something else.

742
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,706
We're missing something.

743
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,756
Private ambulance just
gained entry into the facility

744
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,196
through gate three.

745
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,936
A detainee was just
rushed into med bay

746
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,846
multiple stab wounds.

747
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,676
And here's the kicker... it's
Rob Whitfield's brother, Chris.

748
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,116
Well, we... we do not believe
in coincidences in this office.

749
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,336
Get back! Move! Move!

750
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Hey!

751
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,076
Got the details.

752
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,866
Chris Whitfield was
stabbed ten minutes ago.

753
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,736
When the warden flipped the
block, they found his burner.

754
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,476
Look at his last message.

755
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,046
"Get to the med bay,
brother. I'll be waiting."

756
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,810
I want eyes on
that med bay, now!

757
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,826
Get back!

758
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,836
Piggybacking their
security feed now.

759
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,836
- Here we go.
- Okay.

760
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,836
Okay, the man on the
gurney is Chris Whitfield.

761
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,040
- Looks badly injured.
- Wait, wait, wait, stop it.

762
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,276
- Is that...
- Yeah, that is not an EMT.

763
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,846
That's Rob Whitfield.

764
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,456
Maggie, oa, Rob Whitfield
is not with the protesters.

765
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,936
<i>He's driving an ambulance
parked in the med bay.</i>

766
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,326
Riot was just a diversion.

767
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,156
He's trying to sneak
his brother out.

768
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,986
<i>Maggie, oa, do
not let them leave!</i>

769
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,140
I repeat... do not let
that ambulance leave!

770
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,646
Yeah, we got it.

771
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,310
Jubal, we're in pursuit
of the ambulance now.

772
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,390
Suspect's leaving the
yard, heading westbound.

773
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,176
Rob Whitfield!

774
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,160
Get out of the car
with your hands up!

775
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,430
What's he doing?

776
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,870
I don't have a clean shot.

777
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,326
Keep him busy.

778
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,350
Rob, this is the FBI!

779
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,466
You need to lay down
your weapon and surrender!

780
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,580
This is over!

781
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,166
I don't recognize
your authority!

782
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,060
Hey, hey, get out.

783
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,126
Rob, we know that
your brother's hurt!

784
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,800
Stand down so we can help!

785
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,190
We can get him the
medical attention he needs!

786
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Oa, you good?

787
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,350
Yeah. Another calvinite.

788
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,140
He's dead.

789
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,726
No.

790
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,866
No, no, no, no. Chris! Chris!

791
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,810
Chris!

792
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,410
No, no, no!

793
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,820
I asked Chris to
go to greenwich.

794
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,136
I convinced him.

795
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,146
When things went bad, I ran.

796
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,260
I got away, but... He
got caught, and now...

797
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,960
I really thought I could
save him, you know?

798
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,806
I really did.

799
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,246
So you figured out
Calvin wasn't real.

800
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,880
It was just Duke spreading
his lies to make a buck.

801
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,856
But instead of exposing him,
you chose to become the lie.

802
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,776
If I didn't, somebody
else would have.

803
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,320
That's hardly a defense.

804
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,216
Look, I did what I had to
do to try to save my brother.

805
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,500
You took advantage of
people just like your brother,

806
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,616
who still believed in
the Calvin account,

807
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,086
who did your bidding,

808
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,190
and now they are facing
serious consequences for it.

809
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,836
That's their problem.

810
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,966
You knew what you were
posting wasn't the truth,

811
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,406
but you did it anyway.

812
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,366
Look around you, lady!

813
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:26,130
The truth does not
matter anymore!

814
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,920
The truth matters if
we choose that it does.

815
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,546
Give me the password
to the Calvin account

816
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,090
so I can shut it
down once and for all.

817
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,426
We're in.

818
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,230
It worked? We control
the Calvin account?

819
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,866
We do.

820
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,786
And this gives us access
to what, everything?

821
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,046
It should, yeah, every public
and private communication

822
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,940
that has ever come out
of the Calvin account.

823
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,006
- Should be able to see it all.
- Okay, good.

824
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,950
Archive everything... we're
gonna need it for the trial.

825
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,730
Send the whole
file up to my office,

826
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,910
along with the
password for the account.

827
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,326
Adic Reynolds.

828
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:12,236
That... that usually
stays down here with us.

829
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,830
Calling it audible.

830
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,466
You cut off the head
of the snake today.

831
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,410
Take the win, Valentine.

832
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,206
Hey, guys, you should see this.

833
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,126
Yeah? What do you got?

834
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,346
Calvin's private messages
going back five months

835
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,200
to the period right
after the greenwich riot.

836
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,267
Okay, so this is when Duke
controlled the account, right?

837
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,266
So they're sent from him?

838
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,086
Are those

839
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:41,070
direct messages to individual
followers with specific orders.

840
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,610
Looks like Duke's
back on the hook.

841
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,286
You bounced back quick.

842
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,986
I'm nothing if not adaptable.

843
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,026
Sadly, this little
shindig is invite-only.

844
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,506
Party's over, Duke.

845
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,010
I have a deal with your
superior, remember?

846
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,076
Full immunity.
You can't touch me.

847
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,800
Well, that was before
we found the proof

848
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,890
that you ordered your
followers to harass Isobel.

849
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,166
That's stalking a
federal employee...

850
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,516
Which is not part of
your little immunity deal.

851
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,396
Okay, wait, let's

852
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,566
let's think big
picture here, right?

853
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,696
You control the
Calvin account, right?

854
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,046
- I can help you.
- Yeah.

855
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,666
I can make it say
whatever you want

856
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,820
whatever you want!

857
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,536
You are pathetic.

858
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,610
And you're under
arrest, Duke ducoyle.

859
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,740
It only gets worse from here.
