337

Duke targeted our victims

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,429
- OK, so walk me through it.
How does it work?

344
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,798

"Child sex trafficking
is monumental."

346
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,271
All caps.
Duke decoded it.

347
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,273
He said that the National Park Service

348
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,142
is a front for
a child sex trafficking ring,

349
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,810

They usually keep their activity online,

356
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,925

His studio is over in Staten Island.

360

Let's bring him in.

362
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,772

thank you for coming in.

363
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,041

364

on a Calvin message board.

365

That's Park Ranger Desiree Cole

366

"Where is she taking them?"

368
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,153
- I post a lot of photos.

369
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,355

on the hook for solicitation

370

- Good luck to the man
who has to argue that in court.

372

374

375
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,734
- You know this conversation would go

376
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,470

just admit that you are Calvin.

377
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,572
- I couldn't begin to fill Calvin's shoes,

378
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,742
but I do contribute to the conversation.

379
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,645

Calvin is a real person.

You turned five of his words

384
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,389
Because she's just one

- Agency?

387
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,195
- The National Pride Service.

388
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,835
- Clarence Myron, a security guard

389
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,837
for the Greenwich National Monument,

390
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:07,239

The perpetrator was wearing
a mask you sold him.

392
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,112

spent their hard-earned cash
on my website.

394
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,650

395
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,585

396
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,619

What is the truth?

That's life.

905
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:32,009
This is a grift...
all of it, a big grift.

906
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,979
- Do I believe children are
being held in the basement

907
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:38,115
of some gay national monument?
No.

908

No rational person would.

909

But Calvin does, and that works for me.
