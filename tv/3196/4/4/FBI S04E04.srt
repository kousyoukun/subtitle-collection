a fallen tree limb.

Called 911 when he realized
it was a partially buried arm.

I've already
taken his statement

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,184
which I can forward to you.
Any chance he's involved?

43
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,577
No. Based on
the composition of the dirt,

44
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:09,667
the body was buried
sometime early this morning,

45
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:10,712
and he just flew in
on assignment

46
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,888
from Nat Geo a few hours ago.

47
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,325
No excess blood around
the body or in the soil.

48
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:17,501
I think he was killed
somewhere else.

63

young, black, and homeless.

Hey, Jubal.
Yeah?

that was installed
three days ago

78
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,791
to monitor animal crossings.
Good news for us

79
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,401
is that it gives us
a clear view of the road

80

less than a half mile
from the burial site.

The only vehicle
that was captured

Elise, you want to help me out?

92
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,428
Based on the height
of the van,

93
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,343
specs on the interior,
estimate the seated subject

94
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:01,823
is about 5'10".

95
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,172
Hoodie is form-fitting.

96
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,130
The guy is obviously fit
so he probably weighs

97
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,219
about 170 pounds.
Meaning he's probably

98
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:08,960
a lefty based on
the dominant use

99
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:10,527
of that hand on
the steering wheel.

100

Somebody talk to me
about the most recent victim,

101
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:14,662
Rob Holden.
20 years old.

102
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:17,273
Born in Hazard, Kentucky.
He's got three priors

103
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,275
for solicitation.
Two in the West Village.

104
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,147
Reports indicate that he picked
up his johns at local clubs.

105
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,062
O--okay so we need to
start pulling

the first victim was killed?

00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,400
No security cams or witnesses
to the theft.

121
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,184
Okay, can you arrange
for the owner of the vehicle

122
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,664
to come down, check the front,
see if there's anything

123
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,883
in there that doesn't
belong to him?

124
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:04,189
Not a problem.
Lot of blood in that van.

125
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,410
All right, we need
a thorough sweep of the van.

126
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,020

Had a shovel and
some other stuff in his hands.

139
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,391
Figured he was up to no good.
Did he get in a car,

140
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,305
or he walk off by foot?
He walked

141
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,264
straight into that warehouse
at the far end of the block.

142
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:37,788
Been abandoned for years.
Haven't seen him walk out,

143
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,269

00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,327
Okay, man, okay!

160
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:51,209
<i>♪</i>

161
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:53,864
Hey--
Yeah, go, I got this.

162
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,530
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa--

163
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:15,930
Stop.

164
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,944
Let go--up!

165
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,119
Put your hands
behind your back.

166
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:32,512
Hands behind your back!

167
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,781
Clean bill of health?
Yeah.

168
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,173
I mean, just a little sore.

169
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:43,435
My shoulder
took most of the hit.

170
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,741
Look, you were probably
right.

171
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,743
Maybe we should've waited
for backup.

172
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,746
So those teens--
they were a couple of runaways.

173
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,834
What about the guy
with the shovel?

174
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,357
Currently homeless.

175
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:53,663
Just got out of jail
two days ago.

176
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,447
Definitely not our guy.
Why was he in the van?

177
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,406
Found it unlocked.
Rifling through,

178
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:59,190
looking for stuff to sell.
Hey.

179
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,453
Just spoke to the owner
of the stolen van.

180
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:02,846
The shovel isn't his.

181
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,108
So we're gonna send it
to the lab for analysis.

182
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,067
Hopefully we can get
some prints or some DNA.

183
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,548
Doesn't look that old.
Maybe the JOC can run down

184
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:11,159
where it's sold.
We'll get lucky.

185
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,422
Profile's starting
to take shape.

186
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,250
Killer's persistent
if not sophisticated.

187
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:17,078
Five bodies in 14 days?

188
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,775
He's got an itch
that he can't scratch.

189
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,777
The behavioral analysis unit
thinks it's probably

190
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,997
somebody who's struggling
with their own sexuality.

191
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,477
Maybe somebody new in the area
who finds that kind of

192
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:28,568
open community exciting but
triggering at the same time.

193
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,613
And the method of killing--
stabbing in the neck

194
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,528
to watch them bleed out--that
is all about anger and rage.

195
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,443
Yeah, if he stays on pattern,

196
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:35,836
he's going to
strike again soon.

197
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,925
We need to find this guy fast.

198
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,796
Kelly, where are we
on the shovel?

199
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,364
Uh, the only DNA recovered
was from Agent Scola

200
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,148
and the homeless guy
who punched him.

201
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,498
Well, damn, suspect
must've been wearing gloves

202
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,152
the entire time he handled it.

203
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:50,198
But the dirt samples
taken from it did match

204
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,765
the New York
National Park soil.

205
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,114
Okay, so the shovel
is the killer's.

206
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,594
Where are we on its purchase?

207
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:55,899
Lots of places
in New York sell it.

208
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,205
We're putting together a list,

209
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,641
trying to narrow down
time and date sold.

210
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,512
Grab the corresponding
security footage as well.

211
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:03,733
Okay, good, so the shovel
is a promising lead,

212
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,517
but let's--let's not
rely on that alone

213
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:07,998
to dig us out of this hole.
See what I did there?

214
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,000
It's called a pun.

215
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,134
I might have something.

216
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,005
Been scrubbing video footage
from last night

217
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:17,007
around the Christopher Street
area like you asked.

218
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,967
Building security cam footage
shows the latest victim,

219
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,013
Rob Holden, leaving the club.
Eyes up.

220
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:26,016
Now time stamp on that video
is 3:45 in the morning.

221
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,757
Okay, so to get
from this club

222
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:28,976
to the New York
National Park,

223
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,630
that takes an hour and 15 yeah?

224
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:33,415
So shortly after this footage
was shot, Rob was killed

225
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,896
and driven upstate
in this blue van.

226
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:39,073
Do we have a facial ID on
the bouncer he was talking to?

227
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:41,118
Yup. Guy's name
is Greg Robinson.

228
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,599
All right.

229
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,037
We don't have
any security cameras.

230
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,256
I keep asking them
to put some in,

231
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:49,823
but the boss thinks
it's intrusive.

232
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,563
Well, this man's name
is Rob Holden.

233
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,435
He was killed last night

234
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:55,698
shortly after
this video was taken.

235
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:59,615
Wow, for real?
What did you two talk about?

236
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,138
I can't remember.

237
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,444
It's like a circus
at closing time,

238
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:03,837
like trying to herd cats
out the door.

239
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,577
That is, if the cats
were all drunk dudes

240
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,492
trying to hook up
with each other.

241
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,320
This was less than
24 hours ago.

242
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:13,194
I'm trying to remember
but...

243
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:16,110
I think he was just, uh,
another party guy, you know?

244
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:18,634
Bouncing around, dancing,
talking to 20 different dudes

245
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,723
at once looking to get
a free vodka tonic.

246
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,683
You know what I mean?
What about a different guy?

247
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,641
Medium build,
wearing a black hoodie,

248
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,077
driving a blue van
at some point.

249
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,252
You remember somebody
like that?

250
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:31,168
Um, I want to help,
I really do,

251
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,083
but I don't be looking
at these dudes

252
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,519
and the clothes
they be wearing.

253
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,521
You know what I'm saying?
Sure.

254
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,001
Not that it's a big deal
or anything.

255
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:40,743
One life, one love right?

256
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,659
Okay, well, if you remember
anything, just give us a call.

257
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,056
I'm gonna get Kelly to pull

258
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,535
the club's credit card records
from last night.

259
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,581
Yeah, especially since
Holden would talk

260
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:54,583
to anybody
who'd buy him a drink.

261
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:57,064
Guy definitely wanted us
to know he was not gay.

262
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,066
Yeah, that mindset is still
prevalent in my community,

263
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:01,329
especially with the men.
Where you going?

264
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,766
Oh, to the outreach center
down the block.

265
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,334
For what?
Well, my cousin works there.

266
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:08,249
He's a pastor.
Might know something.

267
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,077
Worth a shot.

268
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,907
Yeah, I've seen a few
of these guys before.

269
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,692
Never counseled any of them
one on one, though.

270
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,086
Wish I had...maybe that
would've changed their outcome.

271
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,957
Come on,
let's not do this again, okay?

272
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,350
These kids were targeted

273
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:23,525
because of one man's
self-hatred

274
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:24,831
and not because
they didn't have

275
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,093
enough Jesus in their lives.

276
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,965
I know.
I just wish I could've helped.

277
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,967
Find a way to get them out
of this lifestyle, you know.

278
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:34,405
These guys are sellin' drugs,
turning tricks, you name it--

279
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,537
just so they can get
their next meal.

280
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,322
Terrence,
like I've always told you

281
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,585
you cannot save everybody.
Okay?

282
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,937
What about the people
you have counseled?

283
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,374
Any whispers about anyone new

284
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,854
or dangerous
in the neighborhood?

285
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:50,117
There's always someone
preying on these young men.

286
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,597
Most of them are runaways,
out of work.

287
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,382
Makes them ripe
for exploitation.

288
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:57,211
These murders are
pretty recent, so the person

289
00:12:57,254 --> 00:13:00,431
we're looking for probably
just showed up on the scene.

290
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,172
Guessing he's aggressive.

291
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:05,523
Probably hookin' up sexually
with these young men...

292
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,351
before he kills them, that is.

293
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,833
There's a guy named Isaac.

294
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,835
He extorts a lot
of the homeless

295
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,491
making them pay for protection,
using violence if they refuse.

296
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,580
As you can imagine,
they're broke so...

297
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,103
So they turn tricks.

298
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:23,193
You know if anyone's ever
reported him to the cops?

299
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,152
These men
don't trust the police.

300
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,937
Plus, this Isaac dude's
pretty scary.

301
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:30,897
I've seen him a few times.
He carries a knife on his belt.

302
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,637
He isn't shy
about using it either.

303
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:39,775
All right, what else do
we know about Mr. Jones here?

304
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,863
Aside from the fact
that he has a penchant

305
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,822
for cheap neck tattoos.

306
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,388
Has a long history
of robbery and assault.

307
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:45,868
Currently has an arrest warrant
in the system

308
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,304
for the latest one.
Good.

309
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:48,697
Means you can drag
his ass in for questioning

310
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,872
whether he likes it or not.

311
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,265
Do we have
a last known address?

312
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:53,049
He's got a small house
in Brownsville.

313
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,095
67th and Foster,
the rough part.

314
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,661
The really rough part.

315
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,925
I made some arrests
in that area back in the day.

316

You never told me
you worked that beat.

317

You never asked.

318
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,889
Well, since Tiff
is apparently familiar

319
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,631
with the area, you want us
to go pick Isaac up?

on the wrong side
of a fight today.

Yeah, Maggie and OA
are still in the field.

is in the crime lab.

used to kill these men?

Zero.
I don't kill people.

349
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,936
I protect them.
You mean you extort them.

350

You shake them down
for money or else.

351

Is this what happens to
the people who don't pay you?

352
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,247
Come on, I'm a businessman

353
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,858
just like every other
security firm.

354
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,860
I offer my services
for a fee.

355
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:34,036
If somebody don't need it,
that's cool.

356
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,125
I got enough clients as it is.

357
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,259
Killers like this,
putting dudes in the dirt,

it's good for business.

359
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,177
Then the other day
there was this one guy,

360
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,831
they call him Crabtree--
he almost got grabbed up.

361
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,312
Got away and told all
his friends.

362
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:54,100
Now they really trippin'.
Gonna have to pay me double.

363

What do you mean
he almost got grabbed up?

00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:59,148
By who?
I don't know, some guy.

365
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:01,498
Tried to throw him in the back
of the van and he got away.

366
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:05,720
And like I said, business
has been good ever since.

367
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:08,070
Hey, guys.

368
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:16,035
Lab just called.
Isaac's knife is not a match.

369
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,689
So he's got more than one.
Yeah, likely.

370
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,474
But, uh, we scrubbed some
building security footage

371
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:21,823
across the street
from where he lives.

372
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,955
Found time-stamped video
of him at his house

373
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,523
when Holden was killed,
so he's not our killer.

374
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,569
Well, it might not
be a complete waste of time.

375
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,266
Isaac might've just given us
a witness.

376
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,181
He said some guy named Crabtree

377
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,922
almost got abducted
the other day.

378
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:37,099
Really? Crab--Crabtree?
Street name.

379
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,057
Right.

380
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:44,106
Yeah I--I know the name.
Sells dope, hustles older men.

381
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,803
Picks some pockets too.

382
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:46,978
Whatever it takes
to make a buck.

383
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:49,764
Don't suppose you know
his full name?

384
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,201
Um, no--not
off the top of my head,

385
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,724
but I take
pretty detailed notes

386
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,465
of all the people I counsel.
I can check my files.

387
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,993
Uh, I tried putting
him into programs,

388
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:04,039
but he just keeps
going back to the life.

389
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:09,175
Um, thanks so much
for helping out, cuz.

390
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:12,134
We really appreciate it.
Yeah, of course.

391
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,270
Take a lot of photos too.

392
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:24,233
Wow, you weren't kidding
about these notes.

393
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,540
This is impressive.

394
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,194
Please don't do that.

395
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,848
These people deserve
their privacy.

396
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,242
There's a lot of personal
information in here.

397
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:35,288
I apologize.

398
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:43,644
Crabtree's full name
is on the back.

399
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,689
Please let him know I'm here
to help if he wants it.

400
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,480
All right, so
Phillip Johnson, aka Crabtree,

401
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,090
how do we find this guy?
What do we know?

402
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,353
Uh, not much.
No permanent address.

403
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:59,312
Hustler, runs at night.
Which means he fits

404
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,009
the profile
of the other victims.

405
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:03,011
He has six solicitation
arrests too.

406
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:05,187
But the last three were
in a four block radius

407
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:06,971
of Christopher Street.
Okay, yeah.

408
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:08,495
Let's set up over there

409
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,018
and see if we can't find
Mr. Crabtree.

410
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:16,459
Is that him?
Yeah.

411
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:18,374
Hey, Crabtree, FBI.

412
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:20,681
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

413
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:22,117
What's going on?
I--I didn't do nothing.

414
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
You're not in trouble,
okay, like she said,

415
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,903
we just have a few questions.
Okay. About what?

416
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,168
Couple days ago, a guy
in a van tried to grab you.

417
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,386
Is that true?

418
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:33,433
Yeah. What about it?
What color was it?

419
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:34,434
Blue.

420
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:39,090
Can you tell us
what he looked like?

421
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:41,092
No. It was dark in the spot
where he pulled up.

422
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,398
And he was wearing gloves

423
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,095
and a hoodie pulled low
over his face.

424
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,796
Did he try to talk to you?
Like as a customer, a john?

425
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,232
Is that how
he got close to you?

426
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,755
No, it wasn't anything
like that.

427
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,453
To be honest, I thought
it was this preacher I know

428
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:54,976
from the church.

429
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,325
He drives a blue van
just like that.

430
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,893
So I went over to say hey,
but this dude jumped out

431
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,242
and tried to grab me.

432
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:03,114
Was he medium build?
Did you see a knife?

433
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:05,508
Look, I don't know.
Well, come on.

434
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,554
You gotta remember something
that can help us out.

435
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:10,034
Look, hand to God, I swear
I didn't--I didn't see no face.

436
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,776
I don't know how big he was,
but he was Black for sure.

437
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,126
I saw a little bit of his arm
when he tried to grab me.

438
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:23,657
Come on.

439
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,316
FBI, what's going on?

440
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:33,014
Busboy taking out the trash
called it in.

442
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:57,299
Listen up--bad news is
our killer has struck again,

443
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:59,301
which means he is not
afraid of the cops.

444
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,651
In fact, the thrill
of the kill seems to be

445
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,393
accelerating his activity.
So let's revisit

446
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:06,743
what we know so far--
he is Black, medium build,

447
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:09,442
carries a knife,
and used to drive a blue van.

448
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:12,183
And we have his shovel.
Yep, and we have his shovel,

449
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,055
though we don't know who bought
it or from where.

450
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:15,970
Not yet anyway.
Any update, Elise?

451
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:17,624
Not yet.
I've got over 100 people

452
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,539
on video buying
that exact shovel

453
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:20,888
from various stores
throughout New York.

454
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,150
Knowing the suspect is Black
is helpful.

455
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,456
I can narrow the search
even more.

456
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:25,980
Once you get facial rec hits
on the buyers,

457
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:27,329
make sure you prioritize those

458
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:29,331
with a violent criminal
history.

459
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:34,945
No, no, no that's right.
Look.

Hi.

461
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,908
What's up?

462
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:42,953
So I just finished scrubbing
some new security video

463
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:44,999
from a street cam down
the block from Don John's.

464
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:46,827
Captures the club's side entrance.

465
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,089
Did you get Holden
talking to anybody?

466
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:50,483
No, Holden was not
in any of the footage

467
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:54,400
but Tiff's cousin,
Terrence, was.

468
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,097
The pastor?

469
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,403
He was at Don John's

470
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,100
the night that Holden
was murdered,

471
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:01,972
and it did not look like he was
on official church business.

472
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:04,192
Okay, that's weird
that a pastor would party,

473
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,673
but it doesn't prove anything.
No, but it's more than that.

474
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:09,023
Think about it, okay?
Terrence is familiar

475
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,373
with the type of victims this
type of killer is targeting.

476
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,593
I saw his files.
Lots of long lens shots

477
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:16,770
like he's stalking these guys.
And he drives a light blue van

478
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:18,075
as part of the outreach.

479
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,947
We already got
the killer's van.

480
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,079
I know, but it's the same
type used by the church.

481
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:24,647
Could be the reason
the victims got inside.

482
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,258
If Terrence is the killer,
okay,

483
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:29,391
and I'm not saying
that he is,

484
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,959
stealing the same type of van
that he drives for the church,

485
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,004
that's a clever move.

486
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:36,224
I mean it's possible but--

487
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:39,575
It could just be
a weird coincidence.

488
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,882
Look bottom line
is that Terrence knew

489
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:44,450
that Holden was at Don John's
the night that he was killed,

490
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:47,453
but Terrence never mentioned
that he was there too.

491
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:50,107
That is weird.
Did you run it by Tiff?

every night around 9 p.m.,

512

so there's no way to track him
during the time of the murders.

So what?
That doesn't make him a killer.

No, but it creates questions

00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:41,883
Maybe.

625
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:45,756
T, that's okay.

626
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,281
If--if that's who you are,
that's how you feel,

627
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:50,849
there's absolutely nothing
to be ashamed of here.

628
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,676
I know but, uh--

629
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,072
Some people in the community,
they--

630
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:58,857
To hell with them.

631
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,511
Now look, I need you to tell me
everything about that night.

632
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:03,600
I mean, is--is there anybody
that can alibi you out?

633
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:05,559
Did--did you talk to somebody
or go home with somebody?

634
00:31:05,602 --> 00:31:08,301
No, I didn't. I didn't.

635
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:11,173
And I don't want you tellin'
any of your people my business.

636
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:13,132
I mean that.
Nobody here's gonna care, T.

637
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:15,482
I don't give a damn about
what they think.

638
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:17,788
I care about what goes
in that report.

639
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:20,704
If it's documented,
the church will find out,

640
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:23,577
and it will ruin everything
that I've worked for.

641
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:27,102
So this needs to stay
between you and me.

642
00:31:32,412 --> 00:31:33,587
Promise me.

643
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,292
If I can't go in the field,
I can at least help out here.

644
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:45,773
Um, Elise, where are we at
with the shovel?

645
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:47,601
I've got it narrowed down to
at least 12 potential suspects

646
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:48,732
but I still need to run

647
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,038
criminal histories
on most of them.

648
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,833
I know this guy.

649
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:08,491
Okay, I can't go into detail

650
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:10,145
but my cousin isn't good
for these murders.

651
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,538
You're just gonna have to
trust me on this.

652
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:12,843
The real killer
is still out there,

653
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:15,368
and I think I know who he is.

654
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:18,110
The man buying a shovel
in this photo is Greg Robinson.

655
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:19,981
He's a bouncer at Don John's
and he was seen

656
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,635
talking to Holden
just before he was murdered.

657
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:23,637
All right, it's worth chasing
but it still doesn't

658
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,378
alibi out your cousin--
at least not yet.

659
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:27,249
Terrence is gay.

660
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,600
Or at least he suspects
that he might be.

661
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:31,993
That's why he lied.

662
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,516
He was afraid that the church
would find out

663
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,736
and fire him
and he would lose everything.

664
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,999
I understand,
but suppressed sexuality

665
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,175
fits perfectly
with our killer's profile.

666
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:43,265
Hey, we ran
Robinson's cell phone GPS.

667
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:44,875
He was near
New York National Park

668
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,268
the night of Holden's murder.

669
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:48,444
Near the park or at the park?

670
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,229
Near. Cell phone tower
coverage in that area

671
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:52,927
is spotty and no way
to pinpoint the exact location.

672
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,321
So all we have against him
is circumstantial evidence.

673
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:58,063
He was seen buying the same
shovel that the killer used.

674
00:32:58,106 --> 00:32:59,934
He's good for this.
OA's over at Don John's.

675
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,370
Greg Robinson's not on shift,

676
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:02,937
but his cell in pinging
in that area.

677
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,852
Because he's looking
for his next victim.

678
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:07,898
All right have OA stay there.
See if Robinson circles back.

679
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:10,031
The rest of them can start
a grid search on foot.

680
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:12,164
Wait not you.

681
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:14,775
Listen I want him to be
the killer as much as you do,

682
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:16,690
but until we know for sure
you need to step aside

683
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,605
and let the others handle this.

684
00:33:33,968 --> 00:33:36,623
Okay, phone's pinging
into this building.

685
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,059
I think we should split up.
Cover more ground.

686
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:39,104
I'm going to take
the east side.

687
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:41,149
All right, I'll go west.

688
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,894
Entering the back
of the building now.

689
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,333
The street's clear.
I'm heading down the alley.

690
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:15,314
Oh, easy. Up you go.

691
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:17,185
Hey, hey, hey,
look at me, kid.

692
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:20,101
You're gonna be okay.
I'm FBI, all right?

693
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,755
We got a man down
in the west alley.

694
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:23,496
I need an ambulance
to 8th and Hudson asap.

695
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:25,193
Scola, I'm on my way.

696
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,803
Hey, can you tell me
who did this to you?

697
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:27,804
Which way he went?

698
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:34,724
<i>♪</i>

699
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,749
Suspect down.
Roll a second ambulance.

700
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:02,970
I'll cover.

701
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:07,366
Hey, can you hear me?

702
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,803
Just stay with me, okay?

703
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:12,719
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
stay with me.

704
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:14,982
Come on.

705
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,124
He's dead.

706
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,227
You went into the field

707
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,272
after I specifically
ordered you not to.

708
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:46,448
I know and I'm sorry.

709
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:49,973
Whatever punishment you decide
upon, I won't contest it.

710
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:56,632
Scola also told me how
you saved his life out there.

711
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:59,374
Which is why I don't think
this needs to be

712
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,376
anything more than
a verbal reprimand.

713
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,989
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

714
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,382
Have a seat.

715
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,605
Unfortunately, when it comes
to your cousin,

716
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:15,825
I cannot offer him
the same leniency.

717
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:19,655
What do you mean?
The ADIC has weighed in.

718
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:21,527
She says there has to be
consequences

719
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,486
for people who lie
to the FBI.

720
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:41,329
I only held back
because I was afraid.

721
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:43,679
I didn't want to--
I know.

722
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,073
I get it.

723
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:51,905
But your lies prevented us
from doing our job.

724
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,171
Terrence, if you had
told the truth...

725
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,305
that last victim,
he'd be alive right now.

726
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,438
Two people were killed tonight,
T, you get that, right?

727
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:07,312
I just wish you had told me.

728
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,055
I wish you would've been honest
from the beginning because...

729
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,797
lying to an agent--
that's a felony.

730
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:19,411
And now my hands are tied.

731
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,505
I'm sorry.

732
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:30,422
Tiff--

733
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:33,468
Can you just, uh, please.

734
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:39,300
Tiff.

735
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:50,833
You got to stand up, T.

736
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:57,057
Hands behind your back.

737
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:06,284
You going to be all right, T.
All right?

738
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,332
Okay?

739
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,682
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

740
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:15,075
Just like always.

741
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:17,947
All right?

742
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,593
I know that you're upset.

743
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,602
But I was just trying
to protect you.

744
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:06,431
You know, if you would've
come to me first--

745
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:08,433
if you would've told me
what you were thinking,

746
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,304
I could've gone in there
and gotten answers

747
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,220
before Terrence had a chance
to lie to Maggie and OA.

748
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:16,310
You were too close to it.
If Terrence had been the killer

749
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,443
you could've said something
or done something.

750
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:23,926
I just wanted to
keep you out of it, Tiff.

751
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,102
'Til we knew for sure
what was going on.

752
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,193
You know,
if you really knew me...

753
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:34,502
I mean, as a person...

754
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:39,420
you'd know I'd never do
anything to compromise a case.

755
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:42,423
Even if family was involved.

756
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,991
And that's the real problem
with this partnership

757
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:47,036
is that we don't talk.

758
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,516
Like real talk.

759
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:53,521
You can't expect me
to reveal things about my life

760
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:56,872
when you stay so damn
buttoned up all the time

761
00:39:56,916 --> 00:40:00,180
just to project this idiotic
of quiet toughness.

762
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:06,578
You're right.

763
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,325
Maybe it is time...

764
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:19,025
to have some
real conversations.

765
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:23,595
Not just small talk.

766
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:32,342
I'm down for that.
