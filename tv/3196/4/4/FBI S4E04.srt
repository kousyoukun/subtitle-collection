1
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,960
I wasn't sure if you were
going to show up or not.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,740
- I almost gave up.
- I almost didn't,

3
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,580
but I couldn't help myself.

4
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,230
I get it.

5
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,100
It feels wrong for guys like you.

6
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,580
Don't fight it.

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,310
I want to make you feel so good.

8
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,300
Uhh...

9
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,710
See you, T.

10
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,370
- Hey.
- Hey.

11
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,680
Church on a weekday. I'm impressed.

12
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,330
Yeah, well, not exactly.

13
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,940
It's a memorial service for my father.

14
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,160
He passed a year ago today.

15
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,990
Oh, I'm sor... I didn't know.

16
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,650
Are you okay?

17
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,420
No, I'm good.

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,560
My mom passed two years before him,

19
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,650
so I kind of got
this grief thing on lock.

20
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,570
Okay, but you know
if you ever need to talk...

21
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,530
Oh, thanks, but I'm good.

22
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,140
I know talking about our personal lives

23
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,450
- is not really our thing.
- It isn't?

24
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,490
- No.
- Oh, come on, since when?

25
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,450
- Since we met.
- What? We talk.

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,610
We're talking... isn't that
what we're doing right now?

27
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Sure.

28
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,030
Oh, wait.

29
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,250
Oh, we just got a case.

30
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,690
Jubal wants us to head
straight to crime scene.

31
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,260
Um, I'll liaison with ERT
if you want to get an update.

32
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,530
I'm Sergeant Mitchell.
You the ones taking the handle on this?

33
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,180
Affirmative. Agent Scola.

34
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,230
My partner over there is Agent Wallace.

35
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,400
- What do you know so far?
- Not much.

36
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,460
Witness who called it in
is a nature photographer.

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,610
Thought he'd tripped over
a fallen tree limb.

38
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,440
Called 911 when he realized
it was a partially buried arm.

39
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,100
I've already taken his statement

40
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,400
- which I can forward to you.
- Any chance he's involved?

41
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,800
No. Based on
the composition of the dirt,

42
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,890
the body was buried
sometime early this morning,

43
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,110
and he just flew in on assignment
from Nat Geo a few hours ago.

44
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,550
No excess blood around
the body or in the soil.

45
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,720
I think he was killed somewhere else.

46
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,640
Gonna be honest here,

47
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,000
we've never dealt with
something like this before.

48
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,470
Any luck identifying the victim?

49
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,900
No. I went through his pockets,

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,470
found a few condoms
and some cash but no ID.

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,480
Kay. Hopefully DNA and prints
will give us some answers.

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,000
- Scola, you got to see this.
- What do you got?

53
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,440
Four more graves.

54
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,490
- Dog alerted on all of them?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,580
Looks like our killer's been
putting in some serious work.

56
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,980
Take a good look, folks.
DNA is in and our recently

57
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,890
discovered serial killer
appears to have a type...

58
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,630
Young, black, and homeless.

59
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,110
Most of these young men

60
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,070
had prior drug or prostitution charges

61
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,510
in and around the West Village.

62
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,250
All were stabbed in the neck.

63
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,600
None, and this saddens me to say...

64
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,210
Had been reported missing
by friends or relatives, so...

65
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,080
let's dig in extra hard, huh?

66
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,650
Since nobody else really seemed to care.

67
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,520
- Go to work.
- Do we have any

68
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,050
security footage we can scrub
from the park or the roads?

69
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,350
None to speak of yet.

70
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,830
- Hey, Jubal.
- Yeah?

71
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,140
I think we got something.
This is from a nature cam

72
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,570
that was installed three days ago

73
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,010
to monitor animal crossings.
Good news for us

74
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,620
is that it gives us
a clear view of the road

75
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,450
less than a half mile
from the burial site.

76
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,450
The only vehicle that was captured

77
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,410
was this blue cargo van with no plates.

78
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,940
Time stamp has it leaving
the park early this morning.

79
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,850
Can we get a facial rec hit
on the driver?

80
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,510
I've tried. Angle's bad.

81
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,160
All right so blue cargo van, no plates.

82
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,730
That help anybody?

83
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,510
Well, we'll work with what we've got,

84
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,730
which admittedly is not
a whole hell of a lot.

85
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,470
What can we ascertain about
the guy's physical attributes?

86
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,210
Elise, you want to help me out?

87
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,650
Based on the height of the van,

88
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,560
specs on the interior,
estimate the seated subject

89
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,040
is about 5'10".

90
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,390
Hoodie is form-fitting.

91
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,350
The guy is obviously fit
so he probably weighs

92
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,440
- about 170 pounds.
- Meaning he's probably

93
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,180
a lefty based on the dominant use

94
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,750
of that hand on the steering wheel.

95
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,660
Somebody talk to me
about the most recent victim,

96
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,880
- Rob Holden.
- 20 years old.

97
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,490
Born in Hazard, Kentucky.
He's got three priors

98
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,500
for solicitation.
Two in the West Village.

99
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,370
Reports indicate that he picked
up his johns at local clubs.

100
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,280
O... okay so we need to start pulling

101
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,720
security footage from
bars in the West Village.

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,500
- Ian, you want to...
- Sir?

103
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,640
- Yeah.
- Hey, do we know when

104
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,200
the first victim was killed?

105
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,600
ME's office says it was
about two weeks ago.

106
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,730
So this guy is striking every few days.

107
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,300
Let's dig in and get this guy
before he strikes again.

108
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,650
NYPD seems to think they found

109
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,040
the killer's vehicle in Brooklyn.

110
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,390
- Any sign of the suspect?
- Uh, negative.

111
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,960
They're sitting on it
until ERT gets there.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,870
All right, you two, grab Maggie and OA.

113
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,570
Get some answers fast.

114
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,310
Stolen three weeks ago over in Queens.

115
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,620
No security cams or witnesses
to the theft.

116
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,400
Okay, can you arrange
for the owner of the vehicle

117
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,880
to come down, check the front,
see if there's anything

118
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,100
in there that doesn't belong to him?

119
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,410
Not a problem. Lot of blood in that van.

120
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,630
All right, we need
a thorough sweep of the van.

121
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,240
If there's a shred of DNA
from our suspect in there,

122
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,330
we're counting on you guys to find it.

123
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,770
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,980
Okay, we'll take
the east side of the block.

125
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,030
You guys want to canvass the west?

126
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,460
Copy that. We'll radio you

127
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,860
- if we find something.
- Okay, we'll do the same.

128
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,770
- Excuse me.
- You guys asking about

129
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,780
that van the cops were
messing with down the street?

130
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,080
Yeah, did you see anyone by it?

131
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,870
Sure did. Saw a suspicious looking guy

132
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,820
climb out of the back of it
when I opened up this morning.

133
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,960
Had a shovel and
some other stuff in his hands.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,610
- Figured he was up to no good.
- Did he get in a car,

135
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,530
- or he walk off by foot?
- He walked

136
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,480
straight into that warehouse
at the far end of the block.

137
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,010
Been abandoned for years.
Haven't seen him walk out,

138
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,490
so maybe he's still in there.
You didn't hear that from me.

139
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,100
Uh, thanks, but doesn't work that way.

140
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,020
We'll be back to chat
after we check it out.

141
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,360
Maybe we should wait for backup.

142
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,710
Eh, we got this.

143
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,890
Radio Maggie, OA,
have them meet us over there.

144
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,440
- You hear that?
- Yeah. You go that way.

145
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,310
I got this.

146
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,620
Yeah.

147
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,060
- There we go.
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.

148
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,300
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

149
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,410
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Let's go, on your stomachs.

150
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,410
On your stomachs now.

151
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,500
Oh, easy, oh...

152
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,550
Okay, man, okay!

153
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,080
- Hey...
- Yeah, go, I got this.

154
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,750
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...

155
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Stop.

156
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,650
Let go... up!

157
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,220
Put your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back!

158
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,010
- Clean bill of health?
- Yeah.

159
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,400
I mean, just a little sore.

160
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,660
My shoulder took most of the hit.

161
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,970
Look, you were probably right.

162
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,970
Maybe we should've waited for backup.

163
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,850
So those teens...
They were a couple of runaways.

164
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,060
What about the guy with the shovel?

165
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,580
Currently homeless.

166
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,890
Just got out of jail two days ago.

167
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,670
- Definitely not our guy.
- Why was he in the van?

168
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,630
Found it unlocked. Rifling through,

169
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,420
- looking for stuff to sell.
- Hey.

170
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,550
Just spoke to the owner
of the stolen van.

171
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,950
The shovel isn't his.

172
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,250
So we're gonna send it
to the lab for analysis.

173
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,190
Hopefully we can get
some prints or some DNA.

174
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,770
- Doesn't look that old.
- Maybe the JOC can run down

175
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,740
where it's sold. We'll get lucky.

176
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,650
Profile's starting to take shape.

177
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,480
Killer's persistent
if not sophisticated.

178
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,300
Five bodies in 14 days?

179
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,000
He's got an itch that he can't scratch.

180
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,000
The behavioral analysis unit
thinks it's probably

181
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,220
somebody who's struggling
with their own sexuality.

182
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,700
Maybe somebody new in the area
who finds that kind of

183
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,790
open community exciting but
triggering at the same time.

184
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
And the method of killing...
Stabbing in the neck

185
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,750
to watch them bleed out... that
is all about anger and rage.

186
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,670
Yeah, if he stays on pattern,

187
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,060
he's going to strike again soon.

188
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,150
We need to find this guy fast.

189
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,020
Kelly, where are we on the shovel?

190
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,590
Uh, the only DNA recovered
was from Agent Scola

191
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,370
and the homeless guy who punched him.

192
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,720
Well, damn, suspect
must've been wearing gloves

193
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,380
the entire time he handled it.

194
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
But the dirt samples
taken from it did match

195
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,990
the New York National Park soil.

196
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,340
Okay, so the shovel is the killer's.

197
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,820
Where are we on its purchase?

198
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,130
Lots of places in New York sell it.

199
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,430
We're putting together a list,

200
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,870
trying to narrow down
time and date sold.

201
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,740
Grab the corresponding
security footage as well.

202
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,960
Okay, good, so the shovel
is a promising lead,

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,740
but let's... let's not
rely on that alone

204
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,220
to dig us out of this hole.
See what I did there?

205
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,230
It's called a pun.

206
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,360
I might have something.

207
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,230
Been scrubbing video footage
from last night

208
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,230
around the Christopher Street
area like you asked.

209
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,190
Building security cam footage
shows the latest victim,

210
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,240
- Rob Holden, leaving the club.
- Eyes up.

211
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,240
Now time stamp on that video
is 3:45 in the morning.

212
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,980
Okay, so to get from this club

213
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,200
to the New York National Park,

214
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,860
that takes an hour and 15 yeah?

215
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,640
So shortly after this footage
was shot, Rob was killed

216
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,120
and driven upstate in this blue van.

217
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,300
Do we have a facial ID on
the bouncer he was talking to?

218
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,340
Yup. Guy's name is Greg Robinson.

219
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,830
All right.

220
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,260
We don't have any security cameras.

221
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,480
I keep asking them to put some in,

222
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,050
but the boss thinks it's intrusive.

223
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,790
Well, this man's name is Rob Holden.

224
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,660
He was killed last night

225
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,920
shortly after this video was taken.

226
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,840
- Wow, for real?
- What did you two talk about?

227
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,360
I can't remember.

228
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,670
It's like a circus at closing time,

229
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,060
like trying to herd cats out the door.

230
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,800
That is, if the cats
were all drunk dudes

231
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,720
trying to hook up with each other.

232
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,550
This was less than 24 hours ago.

233
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,610
I'm trying to remember but...

234
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,340
I think he was just, uh,
another party guy, you know?

235
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,860
Bouncing around, dancing,
talking to 20 different dudes

236
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,950
at once looking to get
a free vodka tonic.

237
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,910
- You know what I mean?
- What about a different guy?

238
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,870
Medium build, wearing a black hoodie,

239
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,300
driving a blue van at some point.

240
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,480
You remember somebody like that?

241
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,390
Um, I want to help, I really do,

242
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,310
but I don't be looking at these dudes

243
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,750
and the clothes they be wearing.

244
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,750
- You know what I'm saying?
- Sure.

245
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,230
Not that it's a big deal or anything.

246
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,260
One life, one love right?

247
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,890
Okay, well, if you remember
anything, just give us a call.

248
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,280
I'm gonna get Kelly to pull

249
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,760
the club's credit card records
from last night.

250
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,810
Yeah, especially since Holden would talk

251
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,810
to anybody who'd buy him a drink.

252
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,290
Guy definitely wanted us
to know he was not gay.

253
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,290
Yeah, that mindset is still
prevalent in my community,

254
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,560
- especially with the men.
- Where you going?

255
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,990
Oh, to the outreach center
down the block.

256
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,560
- For what?
- Well, my cousin works there.

257
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,480
He's a pastor. Might know something.

258
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,300
Worth a shot.

259
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,130
Yeah, I've seen a few
of these guys before.

260
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,920
Never counseled any of them
one on one, though.

261
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,310
Wish I had... maybe that
would've changed their outcome.

262
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,180
Come on, let's not do this again, okay?

263
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,580
These kids were targeted

264
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,750
because of one man's self-hatred

265
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,320
and not because they didn't
have enough Jesus in their lives.

266
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,190
I know. I just wish I could've helped.

267
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,190
Find a way to get them out
of this lifestyle, you know.

268
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,490
These guys are sellin' drugs,
turning tricks, you name it...

269
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,760
Just so they can get their next meal.

270
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,550
Terrence, like I've always told you

271
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,810
you cannot save everybody. Okay?

272
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,160
What about the people
you have counseled?

273
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,600
Any whispers about anyone new

274
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,080
or dangerous in the neighborhood?

275
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,340
There's always someone
preying on these young men.

276
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,820
Most of them are runaways, out of work.

277
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,610
Makes them ripe for exploitation.

278
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,440
These murders are
pretty recent, so the person

279
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,660
we're looking for probably
just showed up on the scene.

280
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,400
Guessing he's aggressive.

281
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,750
Probably hookin' up sexually
with these young men...

282
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,580
before he kills them, that is.

283
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,060
There's a guy named Isaac.

284
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,060
He extorts a lot of the homeless

285
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,720
making them pay for protection,
using violence if they refuse.

286
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,810
As you can imagine, they're broke so...

287
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,330
So they turn tricks.

288
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,420
You know if anyone's ever
reported him to the cops?

289
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,380
These men don't trust the police.

290
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,160
Plus, this Isaac dude's pretty scary.

291
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,120
I've seen him a few times.
He carries a knife on his belt.

292
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,860
He isn't shy about using it either.

293
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,000
All right, what else do
we know about Mr. Jones here?

294
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,050
Aside from the fact that he has a
penchant, for cheap neck tattoos.

295
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,610
Has a long history
of robbery and assault.

296
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,090
Currently has an arrest warrant
in the system

297
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,530
- for the latest one.
- Good.

298
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,920
Means you can drag
his ass in for questioning

299
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,100
whether he likes it or not.

300
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,490
Do we have a last known address?

301
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,280
He's got a small house in Brownsville.

302
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
67th and Foster, the rough part.

303
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,890
The really rough part.

304
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,150
I made some arrests
in that area back in the day.

305
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,460
You never told me you worked that beat.

306
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,060
You never asked.

307
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,120
Well, since Tiff is apparently familiar

308
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,860
with the area, you want us
to go pick Isaac up?

309
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,250
Uh, you guys have already been

310
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,030
on the wrong side of a fight today.

311
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,690
Yeah, Maggie and OA
are still in the field.

312
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,340
They can handle it.

313
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,020
- Isaac Jones.
- Yeah.

314
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
FBI.

315
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,830
Is everything all right?

316
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,560
Just need to have a word with you.

317
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,460
FBI, go, go.

318
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,250
Hey, come on, man.

319
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,510
You take left. I'll take right.

320
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,730
Hey.

321
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,690
- Are you good?
- Yeah, thanks.

322
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,880
What the hell are these?

323
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,320
You know exactly what these are.

324
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Pictures of your victims.

325
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,630
You think I killed these people?

326
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,370
You out of your damn mind.

327
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,890
It doesn't matter what we think, Isaac.

328
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,460
It matters what we can prove.

329
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,850
I'm not guilty,
so how you gonna prove that?

330
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,590
Right now the knife
you tried to fillet me with

331
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,810
is in the crime lab.

332
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,340
What are the odds that it is a match

333
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,030
to the murder weapon
used to kill these men?

334
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,600
Zero. I don't kill people.

335
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,820
- I protect them.
- You mean you extort them.

336
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,870
You shake them down for money or else.

337
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,960
Is this what happens to
the people who don't pay you?

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,130
Come on, I'm a businessman

339
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,740
just like every other security firm.

340
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,740
I offer my services for a fee.

341
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,920
If somebody don't need it, that's cool.

342
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,010
I got enough clients as it is.

343
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,140
Killers like this,
putting dudes in the dirt,

344
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,840
it's good for business.

345
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,060
Then the other day
there was this one guy,

346
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,720
they call him Crabtree...
He almost got grabbed up.

347
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,200
Got away and told all his friends.

348
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,980
Now they really trippin'.
Gonna have to pay me double.

349
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,380
What do you mean
he almost got grabbed up?

350
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,030
- By who?
- I don't know, some guy.

351
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,380
Tried to throw him in the back
of the van and he got away.

352
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,600
And like I said, business
has been good ever since.

353
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,950
Hey, guys.

354
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,920
Lab just called.
Isaac's knife is not a match.

355
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,570
- So he's got more than one.
- Yeah, likely.

356
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,360
But, uh, we scrubbed some
building security footage

357
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,710
across the street from where he lives.

358
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,840
Found time-stamped video
of him at his house

359
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,410
when Holden was killed,
so he's not our killer.

360
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,450
Well, it might not
be a complete waste of time.

361
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,150
Isaac might've just given us a witness.

362
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,070
He said some guy named Crabtree

363
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,810
almost got abducted the other day.

364
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,980
- Really? Crab... Crabtree?
- Street name.

365
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,030
Right.

366
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,990
Yeah I... I know the name.
Sells dope, hustles older men.

367
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,690
Picks some pockets too.

368
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,860
Whatever it takes to make a buck.

369
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,650
Don't suppose you know his full name?

370
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,090
Um, no... not off the top of my head,

371
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,610
but I take pretty detailed notes

372
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,840
of all the people I counsel.
I can check my files.

373
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,880
Uh, I tried putting him into programs,

374
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
but he just keeps
going back to the life.

375
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,060
Um, thanks so much for helping out, cuz.

376
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,020
- We really appreciate it.
- Yeah, of course.

377
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,940
Take a lot of photos too.

378
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,120
Wow, you weren't kidding
about these notes.

379
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,420
This is impressive.

380
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,300
Please don't do that.

381
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,040
These people deserve their privacy.

382
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,130
There's a lot of personal
information in here.

383
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,870
I apologize.

384
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,530
Crabtree's full name is on the back.

385
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,570
Please let him know I'm here
to help if he wants it.

386
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,360
All right, so
Phillip Johnson, aka Crabtree,

387
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,970
how do we find this guy?
What do we know?

388
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,240
Uh, not much. No permanent address.

389
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
- Hustler, runs at night.
- Which means he fits

390
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,890
the profile of the other victims.

391
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,900
He has six solicitation arrests too.

392
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,070
But the last three were
in a four block radius

393
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,400
- of Christopher Street.
- Okay, yeah.

394
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
Let's set up over there

395
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,990
and see if we can't find Mr. Crabtree.

396
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,340
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

397
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,260
Hey, Crabtree, FBI.

398
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,570
We just want to ask you a few questions.

399
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,000
What's going on?
I... I didn't do nothing.

400
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,050
You're not in trouble,
okay, like she said,

401
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,510
- we just have a few questions.
- Okay. About what?

402
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,050
Couple days ago, a guy
in a van tried to grab you.

403
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,270
Is that true?

404
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
- Yeah. What about it?
- What color was it?

405
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Blue.

406
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,510
Can you tell us what he looked like?

407
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,980
No. It was dark in the spot
where he pulled up.

408
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,280
And he was wearing gloves

409
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,980
and a hoodie pulled low over his face.

410
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,680
Did he try to talk to you?
Like as a customer, a john?

411
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,120
Is that how he got close to you?

412
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,640
No, it wasn't anything like that.

413
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,340
To be honest, I thought
it was this preacher I know

414
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,860
from the church.

415
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,210
He drives a blue van just like that.

416
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,780
So I went over to say hey,
but this dude jumped out

417
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,130
and tried to grab me.

418
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,000
Was he medium build?
Did you see a knife?

419
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,390
- Look, I don't know.
- Well, come on.

420
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
You gotta remember something
that can help us out.

421
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,920
Look, hand to God, I swear
I didn't... I didn't see no face.

422
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,660
I don't know how big he was,
but he was Black for sure.

423
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,010
I saw a little bit of his arm
when he tried to grab me.

424
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,540
Come on.

425
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,200
FBI, what's going on?

426
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,900
Busboy taking out the trash
called it in.

427
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,270
Listen up... bad news is
our killer has struck again,

428
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,550
which means he is not
afraid of the cops.

429
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,880
In fact, the thrill
of the kill seems to be

430
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,620
accelerating his activity.
So let's revisit

431
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,970
what we know so far...
He is Black, medium build,

432
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,670
carries a knife,
and used to drive a blue van.

433
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,410
- And we have his shovel.
- Yep, and we have his shovel,

434
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,280
though we don't know who bought
it or from where.

435
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,200
Not yet anyway. Any update, Elise?

436
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,850
Not yet. I've got over 100 people

437
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,770
on video buying that exact shovel

438
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,120
from various stores throughout New York.

439
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,380
Knowing the suspect is Black is helpful.

440
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,690
I can narrow the search even more.

441
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,210
Once you get facial rec hits
on the buyers,

442
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,560
make sure you prioritize those

443
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,560
with a violent criminal history.

444
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,170
No, no, no that's right. Look.

445
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Hi.

446
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,140
What's up?

447
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,180
So I just finished scrubbing
some new security video

448
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,230
from a street cam down
the block from Don John's.

449
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,060
Captures the club's side entrance.

450
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,320
Did you get Holden talking to anybody?

451
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,710
No, Holden was not in any of the footage

452
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,630
but Tiff's cousin, Terrence, was.

453
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,330
The pastor?

454
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,630
He was at Don John's

455
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,330
the night that Holden was murdered,

456
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,200
and it did not look like he was
on official church business.

457
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,420
Okay, that's weird
that a pastor would party,

458
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,900
- but it doesn't prove anything.
- No, but it's more than that.

459
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,250
Think about it, okay?
Terrence is familiar

460
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,600
with the type of victims this
type of killer is targeting.

461
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,820
I saw his files. Lots of long lens shots

462
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,000
like he's stalking these guys.
And he drives a light blue van

463
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,300
as part of the outreach.

464
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,180
We already got the killer's van.

465
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,310
I know, but it's the same
type used by the church.

466
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,880
Could be the reason
the victims got inside.

467
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,490
If Terrence is the killer, okay,

468
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,620
and I'm not saying that he is,

469
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,190
stealing the same type of van
that he drives for the church,

470
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,230
that's a clever move.

471
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,450
I mean it's possible but...

472
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,000
It could just be a weird coincidence.

473
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,110
Look bottom line is that Terrence knew

474
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,680
that Holden was at Don John's
the night that he was killed,

475
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,680
but Terrence never mentioned
that he was there too.

476
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,340
That is weird. Did you run it by Tiff?

477
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,470
No.

478
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,610
I get it, okay? I know.

479
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,560
I just wanted to bounce it off
you guys first

480
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,480
to make sure
I'm even clear-eyed on this.

481
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,050
- What do you think?
- It seems valid to me.

482
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,840
There's no way
Terrence is involved in this.

483
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,540
I mean, I don't know why
he was at that club

484
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,190
but... but I can talk to him about that.

485
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,980
No. Not until we dig deeper.

486
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,110
Jubal's pulling Terrence's phone's GPS

487
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,240
to see if he was at the park
the night of Holden's murder.

488
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,430
This is crazy.

489
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,510
Why the hell didn't you tell me
about this first?

490
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,520
Look, I know my cousin.

491
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,040
He... he's a pastor for a reason.

492
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,260
He doesn't have a violent bone
in his body.

493
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,390
Hey I ju... just got the return
on Terrence's phone records.

494
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,920
- And...
- His phone is shut off

495
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,700
every night around 9 p.m.,

496
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,530
so there's no way to track him
during the time of the murders.

497
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,490
So what? That doesn't make him a killer.

498
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,020
No, but it creates questions
that we need answers to.

499
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,710
Okay, fine. I'll get them for you.

500
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,110
No. Let's have Maggie and OA
bring him in for questioning.

501
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,370
Bring him in? Is that really necessary?

502
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,330
If he has an alibi we can confirm,

503
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,900
it's gonna be a short interview.

504
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,810
If not. We're gonna take
a deeper dive into your cousin.

505
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,950
Listen, I know
that neither of these scenarios

506
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,640
are ideal for you.

507
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,650
Which is exactly why
you need to recuse yourself.

508
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,060
Stand down until we know more.
Am I clear?

509
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,650
Yes, ma'am.

510
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,810
No heads up, for real?

511
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,270
Tiff, I just wanted to make sure that...

512
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,540
We're trying to help you, Terrence.

513
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,670
But if you're telling us
that nobody can confirm

514
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,760
your whereabouts at the times
of the murders...

515
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,590
I mean, you're making our job
a lot harder.

516
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,810
This is crazy.

517
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,680
I... I help people like this.
I don't kill them.

518
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,080
Where's Tiff?

519
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,730
Well you can talk to her in a bit,

520
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,860
but first we need to know
about your cell phone.

521
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,430
Okay. What about it?

522
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,970
Um, why do you turn it off every night?

523
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,300
I... I work outreach.

524
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,050
Most of the people that I deal with

525
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:18,880
are... are night owls, bipolar,
or... or drug addicts.

526
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,840
They've lost their way.

527
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,790
You... you have to set boundaries
with people like that.

528
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,020
So for peace of mind,
and... and, you know,

529
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,410
time to study the scripture,
I shut my phone off at night.

530
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,670
Well, two nights ago
there was a kid, Rob Holden,

531
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,370
who was seen outside a club, Don John's,

532
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,680
shortly before being killed.

533
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,550
Yeah, yeah, I know. Tiff told me.

534
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,820
- Right.
- Did you talk to him there?

535
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,150
What?

536
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,910
No!

537
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,090
I wasn't there at the club.
Why would I go there?

538
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,610
Why lie to the FBI about that?

539
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,310
I mean, I know he's a preacher
and all, but it's 2021.

540
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,750
- Times have changed.
- Not for everyone.

541
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,250
So, um, for the record,
you're saying this isn't you?

542
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,540
No, that's...

543
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,420
That's not me.

544
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,990
I mean, sure, uh, same height,
same build but...

545
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,820
Look, I... I was definitely
not at that club.

546
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,220
Do you own a black hoodie?

547
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,090
Yeah, and so do a thousand
other New Yorkers.

548
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,050
Hey, do I need a lawyer?

549
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,770
What the hell is going on?
Terrence wouldn't hurt a fly.

550
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,560
I know, but there's
some things he has to explain,

551
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,650
and once he does,
he'll be free to leave.

552
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,950
What things?

553
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,480
Why do they suspect
my son of these murders?

554
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,570
I can't go into detail
on that, Unc. I'm sorry.

555
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,910
I am family, Tiff.

556
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,260
What do you mean
you can't go into detail?

557
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,350
It's a criminal investigation.

558
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,530
I... I want to tell you
everything, but I can't.

559
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,920
This is your cousin we're talking about.

560
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,660
You grew up together, for Christ's sake.

561
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,840
- This is insane.
- I know but my hands are tied.

562
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,840
I have seen the news.

563
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,930
They think it's a gay man
killing those kids.

564
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,370
A gay man.

565
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,630
People gonna run their mouths,
think that Terrence is like...

566
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,460
I-is like that. That he's a freak.

567
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,860
It'll ruin his reputation,
all because of you.

568
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,950
And this damn job.

569
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,310
All right, so we haven't been
able to alibi out Terrence,

570
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,970
but we're holding him
pending further investigation.

571
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,100
We need to search his apartment.

572
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,660
Look for a hoodie, the murder weapon,

573
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,620
trophies from the victims,
anything that either

574
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,580
implicates this guy
or proves his innocence.

575
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,970
What about Tiff?

576
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,670
I don't want her involved

577
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,850
in any evidence collection
to play it safe.

578
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,370
Okay, but we don't think that she's...

579
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,240
No, I don't, but if we were to gather

580
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:36,600
some crucial piece of evidence
and she was present,

581
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,160
the defense would leverage that.

582
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,900
Good. Kay.

583
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,350
- You okay?
- Yeah.

584
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,570
I just feel bad. I didn't mean to...

585
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,970
I wasn't trying to
go behind Tiff's back.

586
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,360
Hey, Terrence lied
about going to the club.

587
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,910
That's not on you.

588
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,180
Okay, there's no cameras recording us.

589
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,140
You can talk to me about any of this.

590
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,750
Where have you been?

591
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,580
I'm related to you.
They won't let me be involved.

592
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,670
Why? I didn't do anything wrong.

593
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,370
You lied about being at that club.

594
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,240
- I wasn't there.
- Terrence!

595
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Okay, now I love you,
but I can't help you

596
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,070
if you keep making bad choices.

597
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,070
And lying to me about this
is the king of bad choices.

598
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,160
Now talk to me off the record
if you have to

599
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,990
but just tell me the truth.

600
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,170
O... okay I... I was there.

601
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,240
Yeah, I know,
but why did you lie about it?

602
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,620
It's a gay club. I'm a Baptist pastor.

603
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,010
You do the math.

604
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,270
So you're gay?

605
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,080
I... I'm not sure.

606
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,470
Maybe.

607
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,990
T, that's okay.

608
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,510
If... if that's who you are,
that's how you feel,

609
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,080
there's absolutely nothing
to be ashamed of here.

610
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,600
I know but, uh...

611
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,300
Some people in the community, they...

612
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,090
To hell with them.

613
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,740
Now look, I need you to tell me
everything about that night.

614
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,830
I mean, is... is there anybody
that can alibi you out?

615
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,790
Did... did you talk to somebody
or go home with somebody?

616
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,530
No, I didn't. I didn't.

617
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,400
And I don't want you tellin'
any of your people my business.

618
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,360
- I mean that.
- Nobody here's gonna care, T.

619
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,710
I don't give a damn about
what they think.

620
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,020
I care about what goes in that report.

621
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,930
If it's documented,
the church will find out,

622
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,810
and it will ruin everything
that I've worked for.

623
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,600
So this needs to stay
between you and me.

624
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,060
Promise me.

625
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,520
If I can't go in the field,
I can at least help out here.

626
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,000
Um, Elise, where are we at
with the shovel?

627
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,830
I've got it narrowed down to
at least 12 potential suspects

628
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,960
but I still need to run

629
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,270
criminal histories on most of them.

630
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,410
I know this guy.

631
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,720
Okay, I can't go into detail

632
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,370
but my cousin isn't good
for these murders.

633
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,770
You're just gonna have to
trust me on this.

634
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,950
The real killer is still out there,
and I think I know who he is.

635
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,190
The man buying a shovel
in this photo is Greg Robinson.

636
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,210
He's a bouncer at Don John's
and he was seen

637
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,860
talking to Holden
just before he was murdered.

638
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,870
All right, it's worth chasing
but it still doesn't

639
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,610
alibi out your cousin...
At least not yet.

640
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,290
Terrence is gay.

641
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,830
Or at least he suspects
that he might be.

642
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,220
That's why he lied.

643
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,750
He was afraid that the church
would find out

644
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,970
and fire him
and he would lose everything.

645
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,230
I understand, but suppressed sexuality

646
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,400
fits perfectly
with our killer's profile.

647
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,490
Hey, we ran Robinson's cell phone GPS.

648
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,100
He was near New York National Park

649
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,500
the night of Holden's murder.

650
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,670
Near the park or at the park?

651
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,460
Near. Cell phone tower
coverage in that area

652
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,160
is spotty and no way
to pinpoint the exact location.

653
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,550
So all we have against him
is circumstantial evidence.

654
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,290
He was seen buying the same
shovel that the killer used.

655
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,160
- He's good for this.
- OA's over at Don John's.

656
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,600
Greg Robinson's not on shift,

657
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,170
but his cell in pinging in that area.

658
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,080
Because he's looking
for his next victim.

659
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,130
All right have OA stay there.
See if Robinson circles back.

660
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,260
The rest of them can start
a grid search on foot.

661
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,390
Wait not you.

662
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,000
Listen I want him to be
the killer as much as you do,

663
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,920
but until we know for sure
you need to step aside

664
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,830
and let the others handle this.

665
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,030
Okay, phone's pinging
into this building.

666
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,390
I think we should split up.
Cover more ground.

667
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
I'm going to take the east side.

668
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
All right, I'll go west.

669
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,190
Entering the back of the building now.

670
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,630
The street's clear.
I'm heading down the alley.

671
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,610
Oh, easy. Up you go.

672
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,480
Hey, hey, hey, look at me, kid.

673
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,400
You're gonna be okay.
I'm FBI, all right?

674
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,050
We got a man down in the west alley.

675
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,790
I need an ambulance
to 8th and Hudson asap.

676
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,490
Scola, I'm on my way.

677
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,100
Hey, can you tell me
who did this to you?

678
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,120
Which way he went?

679
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,040
Suspect down. Roll a second ambulance.

680
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,350
I'll cover.

681
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,660
Hey, can you hear me?

682
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,710
Just stay with me, okay?

683
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,010
Hey, hey, hey, hey, stay with me.

684
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,280
Come on.

685
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,420
He's dead.

686
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,520
You went into the field

687
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,570
after I specifically ordered you not to.

688
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,740
I know and I'm sorry.

689
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,270
Whatever punishment you decide
upon, I won't contest it.

690
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,930
Scola also told me how
you saved his life out there.

691
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,670
Which is why I don't think
this needs to be

692
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,670
anything more than a verbal reprimand.

693
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,280
- Thank you.
- I really appreciate that.

694
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,100
Have a seat.

695
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,900
Unfortunately, when it comes
to your cousin,

696
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,120
I cannot offer him the same leniency.

697
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,950
- What do you mean?
- The ADIC has weighed in.

698
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,820
She says there has to be consequences

699
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,780
for people who lie to the FBI.

700
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,620
I only held back because I was afraid.

701
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,970
- I didn't want to...
- I know.

702
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,450
I get it.

703
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,200
But your lies prevented us
from doing our job.

704
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,730
Terrence, if you had told the truth...

705
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,790
that last victim,
he'd be alive right now.

706
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,730
Two people were killed tonight,
T, you get that, right?

707
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,610
I just wish you had told me.

708
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,210
I wish you would've been honest
from the beginning because...

709
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,480
lying to an agent... That's a felony.

710
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,710
And now my hands are tied.

711
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,170
I'm sorry.

712
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,980
Tiff...

713
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,010
Can you just, uh, please.

714
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,590
Tiff.

715
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,340
You got to stand up, T.

716
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,350
Hands behind your back.

717
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,580
You going to be all right, T. All right?

718
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,010
Okay?

719
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,070
I'll be with you every step of the way.

720
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,450
Just like always.

721
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,330
All right?

722
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,890
I know that you're upset.

723
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,900
But I was just trying to protect you.

724
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,730
You know, if you would've
come to me first...

725
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,730
If you would've told me
what you were thinking,

726
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,600
I could've gone in there
and gotten answers

727
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,510
before Terrence had a chance
to lie to Maggie and OA.

728
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,600
You were too close to it.
If Terrence had been the killer

729
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,740
you could've said something
or done something.

730
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,750
I just wanted to
keep you out of it, Tiff.

731
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,400
'Til we knew for sure what was going on.

732
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,720
You know, if you really knew me...

733
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,800
I mean, as a person...

734
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,710
you'd know I'd never do
anything to compromise a case.

735
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,020
Even if family was involved.

736
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,290
And that's the real problem
with this partnership

737
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,330
is that we don't talk.

738
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,230
Like real talk.

739
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,820
You can't expect me
to reveal things about my life

740
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,170
when you stay so damn
buttoned up all the time

741
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,470
just to project this idiotic
image of quiet toughness.

742
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,140
You're right.

743
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,620
Maybe it is time...

744
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,320
to have some real conversations.

745
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,000
Not just small talk.

746
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,280
I'm down for that.
