00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:15,930
- Stop.

174
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,944
- Let go--up!

175
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,119
Put your hands
behind your back.

176
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:32,512
Hands behind your back!

177
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,781
- Clean bill of health?
- Yeah.

178
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,173
I mean, just a little sore.

179
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:43,435
My shoulder
took most of the hit.

180
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,741
- Look, you were probably
right.

181
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,743
Maybe we should've waited
for backup.

182
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,746
- So those teens--
they were a couple of runaways.

183
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,834
What about the guy
with the shovel?

184
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,357
- Currently homeless.

185
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:53,663
Just got out of jail
two days ago.

186
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,447
Definitely not our guy.
- Why was he in the van?

187
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,406
- Found it unlocked.
Rifling through,

188
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:59,190
looking for stuff to sell.
- Hey.

189
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,453
Just spoke to the owner
of the stolen van.

190
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:02,846
The shovel isn't his.

191
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,108
- So we're gonna send it
to the lab for analysis.

192
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,067
Hopefully we can get
some prints or some DNA.

193
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,548
- Doesn't look that old.
- Maybe the JOC can run down

194
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:11,159
where it's sold.
We'll get lucky.

195
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,422
- Profile's starting
to take shape.

196
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,250
- Killer's persistent
if not sophisticated.

197
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:17,078
- Five bodies in 14 days?

198
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,775
He's got an itch
that he can't scratch.

199
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,777
- The behavioral analysis unit
thinks it's probably

200
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,997
somebody who's struggling
with their own sexuality.

201
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,477
Maybe somebody new in the area
who finds that kind of

202
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:28,568
open community exciting but
triggering at the same time.

203
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,613
- And the method of killing--
stabbing in the neck

204
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,528
to watch them bleed out--that
is all about anger and rage.

205
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,443
- Yeah, if he stays on pattern,

206
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:35,836
he's going to
strike again soon.

207
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,925
We need to find this guy fast.

208
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,796
Kelly, where are we
on the shovel?

209
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,364
- Uh, the only DNA recovered
was from Agent Scola

210
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,148
and the homeless guy
who punched him.

211
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,498
- Well, damn, suspect
must've been wearing gloves

212
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,152
the entire time he handled it.

213
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:50,198
- But the dirt samples
taken from it did match

214
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,765
the New York
National Park soil.

215
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,114
- Okay, so the shovel
is the killer's.

216
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,594
Where are we on its purchase?

217
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:55,899
- Lots of places
in New York sell it.

218
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,205
We're putting together a list,

219
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,641
trying to narrow down
time and date sold.

220
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,512
- Grab the corresponding
security footage as well.

221
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:03,733
- Okay, good, so the shovel
is a promising lead,

222
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,517
but let's--let's not
rely on that alone

223
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:07,998
to dig us out of this hole.
See what I did there?

224
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,000
It's called a pun.

225
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,698
[clears throat]

226
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,134
- I might have something.

227
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,005
Been scrubbing video footage
from last night

228
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:17,007
around the Christopher Street
area like you asked.

229
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,967
Building security cam footage
shows the latest victim,

230
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,013
Rob Holden, leaving the club.
- Eyes up.

231
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:26,016
- Now time stamp on that video
is 3:45 in the morning.

232
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,757
- Okay, so to get
from this club

233
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:28,976
to the New York
National Park,

234
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,630
that takes an hour and 15 yeah?

235
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:33,415
- So shortly after this footage
was shot, Rob was killed

236
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,896
and driven upstate
in this blue van.

237
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:39,073
Do we have a facial ID on
the bouncer he was talking to?

238
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:41,118
- Yup. Guy's name
is Greg Robinson.

239
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,599
- All right.

240
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,037
- We don't have
any security cameras.

241
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,256
I keep asking them
to put some in,

242
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:49,823
but the boss thinks
it's intrusive.

243
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,563
- Well, this man's name
is Rob Holden.

244
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,435
He was killed last night

245
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:55,698
shortly after
this video was taken.

246
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:59,615
- Wow, for real?
- What did you two talk about?

247
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,138
- I can't remember.

248
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,444
It's like a circus
at closing time,

249
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:03,837
like trying to herd cats
out the door.

250
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,577
That is, if the cats
were all drunk dudes

251
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,492
trying to hook up
with each other.

252
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,320
- This was less than
24 hours ago.

253
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:13,194
- I'm trying to remember
but...

254
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:16,110
I think he was just, uh,
another party guy, you know?

255
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:18,634
Bouncing around, dancing,
talking to 20 different dudes

256
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,723
at once looking to get
a free vodka tonic.

257
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,683
You know what I mean?
- What about a different guy?

258
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,641
Medium build,
wearing a black hoodie,

259
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,077
driving a blue van
at some point.

260
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,252
You remember somebody
like that?

261
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:31,168
- Um, I want to help,
I really do,

262
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,083
but I don't be looking
at these dudes

263
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,519
and the clothes
they be wearing.

264
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,521
You know what I'm saying?
- Sure.

265
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,001
- Not that it's a big deal
or anything.

266
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:40,743
One life, one love right?

267
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,659
- Okay, well, if you remember
anything, just give us a call.

268
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,056
I'm gonna get Kelly to pull

269
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,535
the club's credit card records
from last night.

270
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,581
- Yeah, especially since
Holden would talk

271
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:54,583
to anybody
who'd buy him a drink.

272
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:57,064
Guy definitely wanted us
to know he was not gay.

273
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,066
- Yeah, that mindset is still
prevalent in my community,

274
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:01,329
especially with the men.
- Where you going?

275
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,766
- Oh, to the outreach center
down the block.

276
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,334
- For what?
- Well, my cousin works there.

277
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:08,249
He's a pastor.
Might know something.

278
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,077
- Worth a shot.

279
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,907
- Yeah, I've seen a few
of these guys before.

280
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,692
Never counseled any of them
one on one, though.

281
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,086
Wish I had...maybe that
would've changed their outcome.

282
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,957
- Come on,
let's not do this again, okay?

283
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,350
These kids were targeted

284
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:23,525
because of one man's
self-hatred

285
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:24,831
and not because
they didn't have

286
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,093
enough Jesus in their lives.

287
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,965
- I know.
I just wish I could've helped.

288
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,967
Find a way to get them out
of this lifestyle, you know.

289
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:34,405
These guys are sellin' drugs,
turning tricks, you name it--

290
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,537
just so they can get
their next meal.

291
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,322
- Terrence,
like I've always told you

292
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,585
you cannot save everybody.
Okay?

293
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,937
- What about the people
you have counseled?

294
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,374
Any whispers about anyone new

295
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,854
or dangerous
in the neighborhood?

296
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:50,117
- There's always someone
preying on these young men.

297
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,597
Most of them are runaways,
out of work.

298
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,382
Makes them ripe
for exploitation.

299
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:57,211
- These murders are
pretty recent, so the person

300
00:12:57,254 --> 00:13:00,431
we're looking for probably
just showed up on the scene.

301
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,172
Guessing he's aggressive.

302
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:05,523
Probably hookin' up sexually
with these young men...

303
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,351
before he kills them, that is.

304
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,833
- There's a guy named Isaac.

305
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,835
He extorts a lot
of the homeless

306
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,491
making them pay for protection,
using violence if they refuse.

307
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,580
As you can imagine,
they're broke so...

308
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,103
- So they turn tricks.

309
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:23,193
- You know if anyone's ever
reported him to the cops?

310
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,152
- These men
don't trust the police.

311
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,937
Plus, this Isaac dude's
pretty scary.

312
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:30,897
I've seen him a few times.
He carries a knife on his belt.

313
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,637
He isn't shy
about using it either.

314
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:39,775
- All right, what else do
we know about Mr. Jones here?

315
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,863
Aside from the fact
that he has a penchant

316
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,822
for cheap neck tattoos.

317
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,388
- Has a long history
of robbery and assault.

318
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:45,868
Currently has an arrest warrant
in the system

319
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,304
for the latest one.
- Good.

320
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:48,697
Means you can drag
his ass in for questioning

321
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,872
whether he likes it or not.

322
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,265
Do we have
a last known address?

323
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:53,049
- He's got a small house
in Brownsville.

324
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,095
67th and Foster,
the rough part.

325
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,661
- The really rough part.

326
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,925
I made some arrests
in that area back in the day.

327

you worked that beat.

328
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,580
- You never asked.

329
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,889
- Well, since Tiff
is apparently familiar

330
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,631
with the area, you want us
to go pick Isaac up?

331

on the wrong side
of a fight today.

333

They can handle it.

00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:21,773

- Yeah.

That's why he lied.

680

He was afraid that the church
would find out

coverage in that area

689
