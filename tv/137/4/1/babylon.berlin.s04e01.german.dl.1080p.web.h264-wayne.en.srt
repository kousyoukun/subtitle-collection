1
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,940
At the end of your journey,

2
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:04,419
Gereon Rath,

3
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,739
you will overcome fear
and become invincible.

4
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,220
Breathe!

5
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,300
Take a deep breath…

6
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,019
and let it out.

7
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:28,140
Be

8
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,220
and who.

9
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,899
Your breath is life.

10
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,340
Fear is death.

11
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,500
Big cold is coming.

12
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:48,899
And your breath knows

13
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,500
that in this end lies a new beginning.

14
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:56,659
You will be free soon.

15
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,899
You will be free and ready…

16
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,940
for the big fight.

17
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:20,260
BABYLON BERLIN SEASON
4, EPISODE 1

18
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,059
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY VOLKER
KUTSCHER

19
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,499
Most is

20
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,459
Just like yesterday, I feel it deep inside

21
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,700
I'd like you to like it
It only takes one word

22
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:07,219
You feel it too, and you understand.
There's no need to talk anymore

23
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,140
Now, just like yesterday,
I'm in love with you

24
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,459
No. That's not it.

25
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,860
So… it goes something like this…

26
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,059
- But this is already from Spoliansky, isn't it?
- Yes I believe…

27
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,899
A moment…

28
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,219
Double left
Then back and forward, so good…

29
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:40,860
…it’s now or never
it’s so inviting…

30
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,100
Ah, so it is!

31
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,980
Everything is alive and playing, so come

32
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,619
Renegade, are we crazy?

33
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,179
Yes, that's right.

34
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,339
This is the song "This day is golden"
by Emil Engels.

35
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,540
Yes, now how do you say…

36
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:57,420
This is very popular these days.

37
00:03:57,499 --> 00:03:59,459
Maybe there is still a copy in there.

38
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,939
It's here too!

39
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,980
I had 100,000 blood in my veins…

40
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:07,260
- Would you like to listen to it again?
- Yes, i would like.

41
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,739
This day is worth gold
In my veins there are 100,000 volts...

42
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,300
I would take this please. By all means.

43
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,699
Íme

44
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,100
Thank you very much.

45
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,660
Night couldn't be more beautiful than this

46
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,980
Two left
, then back, then forward, that's good

47
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,499
Dance up
Now or never, it's so inviting

48
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:40,420
Everything is alive and kicking, come on
Renegade, are we crazy?

49
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:46,660
This day is worth gold
In my veins there are 100,000 volts of heaven

50
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:50,139
And the velvety night caresses me softly

51
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,179
BERLIN, 1930. DECEMBER 31

52
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,540
Is life just a dream?

53
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,300
It would be nice, but I can already see
It's hardly true

54
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,619
I know, it's only thin consolation

55
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:16,579
I HAVE NO JOB FOR TWO YEARS I WILL TAKE
ANYTHING!

56
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,059
Everything changes, nothing is the same anymore

57
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:22,540
THE CRISIS HAS REACHED ITS PEAK

58
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,179
- Good evening!
- Good evening!

59
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,739
- Happy New Year!
- Thank you. For you too!

60
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,220
Charlotte!

61
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,460
What a luck!
I was already afraid that I would avoid it!

62
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,420
I didn't expect
to see it again either.

63
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,619
- Did you get it?
- Uhm!

64
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,939
Great…
Thanks! Late shift?

65
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,540
Yes, until one in the morning. And you?

66
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:06,220
First home,
then celebration. See you there.

67
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,780
I know, I
'll join at half past two at the latest.

68
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,139
Until then, just keep practicing!

69
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:14,139
The first dance in the new year is yours.

70
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,259
Good!

71
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,179
EXIT

72
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,980
The action starts at 9 p.m.

73
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:48,300
All right.
Then we take the second break.

74
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,900
How long can you stretch it?

75
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,540
For half an hour.
Any longer than that would be suspicious.

76
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,100
Right here.
In the evening, you need a flash.

77
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:00,819
Try it yourself!

78
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,420
Free?

79
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,980
So, when...

80
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,020
One moment colleague, not yet!

81
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:13,420
Does the gentleman want to rip off the lady himself?

82
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,179
No, but it brings bad luck
if you tear it off before the New Year.

83
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,860
And even superstitious!

84
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,179
Gentlemen! Last picture of the year! They are coming?

85
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,540
Attention!

86
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,460
Why did the Buddha
put you on standby?

87
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,699
Because of his charming first name,
dear Herr Gräf.

88
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,259
From next year, we will go strictly
in alphabetical order.

89
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,379
Fräulein Charlotte
had the honor of

90
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,939
that you can take the first shift.

91
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,460
Have a nice evening everyone

92
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,300
and
I wish you a successful new year!

93
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,100
- You too, sir!
- Thank you!

94
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,540
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow as fresh
as any other day!

95
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,980
Alphabetically?
But you are "R" like Ritter.

96
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,699
To the Buddha, I will forever be
Fräulein Charlotte, hence "C".

97
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:02,699
- And we don't have the initial letter "A".
- But there is "B": Böhm.

98
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,900
That's why I'm lucky

99
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,900
that I can spend New Year's Eve with the
nicest man in town.

100
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,340
Well,
and for that I will be forever grateful to you!

101
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,699
He was just lucky.
Totally undeserved. Okay.

102
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,980
Keep it up…

103
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,660
- Do you understand how the camera works?
- Yes.

104
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:17,819
Have fun!

105
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,939
ALL FOR GERMANY

106
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:37,380
In principle, the SA must follow
the instructions of the party headquarters.

107
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:39,420
And these are completely clear:

108
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,179
the raid planned for tonight must be canceled immediately !

109
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
No way!

110
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,979
I will not back down at the last minute
like a cowardly dog!

111
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:49,380
Just tell
the gentlemen in the Munich center!

112
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,620
Who is this?

113
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,979
Squad leader Rath,
our man in crime.

114
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,339
Stennes! The Munich order
is absolutely clear.

115
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,219
The participation of the SA in
street fights must be avoided!

116
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,979
Hitler's leader can submit to
the dictates of the system,

117
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:04,579
I won't. We march!

118
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,699
The Führer is a believer in marching within institutional frameworks .

119
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,579
We can't risk
getting the party banned again, man!

120
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,780
- Even Röhm's staff...
- I won't let him be an Austrian

121
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,500
and a gay
ban me from street fights!

122
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:15,939
This endangers…

123
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,420
The discussion is over!

124
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:19,579
Come!

125
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,660
There will be consequences for this, Stennes.

126
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,020
I hope so, gentlemen.

127
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,900
We clean out the pigsty,
and then the orders

128
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:28,339
they come from the capital of the empire,
not from the countryside.

129
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:33,380
You will be the first.
You and the sugar bar are 175.

130
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,780
Stennes!

131
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:39,859
Stennes!

132
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,339
Come on, Waldleitner!

133
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:57,740
Well, Rath?
How long will the street be ours alone?

134
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:01,219
- for 30 minutes. This is the maximum.
- That should be enough.

135
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,859
Why are you so worried?

136
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,380
This will be the first time I reveal
myself to the public.

137
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:12,819
- As a member of the SA. In uniform.
- So what?

138
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,380
It's about time he showed his colors.

139
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,540
The Oberführer!

140
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,939
Comrades, are you ready to attack?!

141
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,819
Yes!

142
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,859
- Victory!
- Unhurt!

143
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,660
- Victory!
- Unhurt!

144
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,260
- Victory!
- Unhurt!

145
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,020
We are the stormtroopers
. No one can stand in our way!

146
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,099
You look a lot like your father.

147
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:03,219
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

148
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,339
Or you're just starting to look more and more like
him.

149
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:28,620
And There you go!

150
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:30,859
The blue Rothschild.

151
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:59,780
Isn't it too precious to wear?

152
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,979
Not when it comes to you.

153
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:14,380
Come!

154
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,780
Well, here's your men's club.

155
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:23,059
Yes, the whole town
wants to come to us.

156
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:27,459
But we want the whole country.

157
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,579
The past year
really flew by, didn't it?

158
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,300
All I said
was this isn't war anymore

159
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,579
but not peace either.

160
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,660
It is an intermediate state
that must end at some point.

161
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,099
Wegener, how nice
that you are celebrating with us!

162
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:09,579
It goes without saying.

163
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,020
Is it here yet?

164
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,300
His mother, Herr Nyssen, had just arrived .

165
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:20,380
- Oh, good evening!
- Good evening, Imperial Chancellor!

166
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,179
May I introduce you?
Mr. General McFarland.

167
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,420
He has been the military attaché of the American Embassy for a few weeks now .

168
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:31,219
Nice
to meet you, General.

169
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,579
Madam…

170
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,219
He's a strange figure,
I wouldn't trust him for a minute.

171
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,420
- But he speaks German quite well.
- That's exactly why.

172
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:44,140
Good evening!

173
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,099
It is an honor to
welcome you, Herr Brüning.

174
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:50,300
It's my pleasure

175
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,300
What a magical end
to such a tumultuous year!

176
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,900
It's as if the castle had
been invented just for such celebrations.

177
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,459
But not for you, my dear.
No stolen charms will help with this.

178
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,219
You are without a doubt
the meanest old bitch

179
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,620
whom Berlin society
has ever seen.

180
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,260
- How? SHE?
- Yes exactly!

181
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,780
And you're the most impudent cheeky record,

182
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:14,459
who could ever play
the role of mistress of this house.

183
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,540
Comrades! The Lords of the Reichstag…

184
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,819
First stage, get off!

185
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,620
...they wanted to forbid
us to go out into the street.

186
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:32,859
And why? Because they are afraid of us!

187
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:34,500
Again!

188
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,140
Because they know…

189
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,620
- Gustav.
- Comrade.

190
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,819
...that their Judaized politics
only benefits the few,

191
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:43,579
and causes the suffering of many.

192
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,219
That's right!

193
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,939
We have been betrayed for years.

194
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:54,300
For years they let
German men and women

195
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,339
- hézezenek…
- Again!

196
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,819
- ...and get cold.
- That's right!

197
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:04,140
- Ma is felkelünk...
- Igen!

198
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,059
...and we will get back
what the Jews took from us!

199
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,140
Again!

200
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:13,740
They are there.

201
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,859
Because we are hungry!

202
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:17,219
We are hungry!

203
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,740
And we want a job!

204
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:20,099
We want a job!

205
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,179
The city is ours!

206
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Come on!

207
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,979
The SA march!

208
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:31,500
- We are hungry!
- We are hungry!

209
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,059
Now off with it!

210
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,780
Damn it!

211
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,020
And now what do we load it with?

212
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,420
Tie it tight! Go! Come on!

213
00:16:57,219 --> 00:16:59,540
Trust me, Toni,
nobody's here anymore.

214
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,140
But he's still there.
We can't hide yet.

215
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:03,219
Of course!

216
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:11,500
The air is clean.

217
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,940
Come!

218
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,180
An idea!

219
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:31,659
Come!

220
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:40,899
POLICE STATION NO. 14
BERLIN-CHARLOTTENBURG

221
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,419
TIETZ STORE

222
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,659
Kuschke!

223
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,220
Kuschke,
they broke into the Tietz at the Ku'Damm!

224
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,500
The gang of shoplifters!

225
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:53,700
What!? Lanke, Kuschke, Hagedorn, we
'll catch them this time! Come on!

226
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,740
Come with me!

227
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:04,059
- There is no such thing.
- I can't believe it! Let's go!

228
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,579
Pack everything!

229
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:19,619
Toni!

230
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,180
Toni!

231
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,980
Give me a sip too!

232
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:28,700
Start it!

233
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,099
- Kurfürstendamm, Tietz.
- Got it!

234
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,740
We approach it from behind. Departures!

235
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:37,099
What exactly
did you want to discuss with me?

236
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,460
I have a very special
surprise for you,

237
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,460
Mr. Government Councillor, on the occasion of the New Year.

238
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,540
- Really?
- Yes. It's about the rockets.

239
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:53,339
My engineers have made tremendous progress.

240
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:54,859
You'll see.

241
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,700
- Go on!
- Patience.

242
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:01,180
Let's have some fun first!

243
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,180
Life should be enjoyed
before we die.

244
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:08,940
- Excuse me for a moment, please!
- Naturally.

245
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:15,500
- How could you do that?
- I do not know what you're thinking.

246
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:17,379
- Good evening!
- Good evening!

247
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,740
You know exactly
what I mean, son, about the jewel!

248
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,819
Frau Bellinghausen, welcome!

249
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,220
So on! Maybe
I should have asked your permission, mother?

250
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,740
Pale purple , you have
no idea what you're doing!

251
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:33,139
No, there isn't.
I've known exactly what I'm doing for a while now .

252
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:39,180
Now you immediately go
to that perszone and take it off!

253
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,579
Are you really there for an ordinary
gem?

254
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,300
That's no ordinary gem!

255
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:46,300
- It's wonderful tonight.
- Mr. Delegation Counselor...

256
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:48,500
- I'm so glad to see you.
- It's my pleasure.

257
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:10,540
Fraulein Seegers!
What are you doing here?

258
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:13,139
I thought he despised capital!

259
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,300
I study the enemy,
Herr Wendt.

260
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,379
So don't say later
that I didn't warn you.

261
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:24,020
- And what do you say about this...
- Oskar? He left.

262
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,619
So is it okay with me?

263
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,940
We are hungry!

264
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,059
We want a job!

265
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:56,180
The SA march!

266
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
CLOSED

267
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,619
We want a job!

268
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,020
- Exactly nine o'clock, okay?!
- Good.

269
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,780
És most!

270
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:26,899
Come on!

271
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,220
Go!

272
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,460
Again!

273
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:01,579
Center, call the police!

274
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:03,180
Police! Please hurry!

275
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,460
Ku'Dammon is full of tricks!
SA is it! Come quickly!

276
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,940
GOLDEN
AGE JEWELRY FROM TIETZTO

277
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,899
Sieg Heil!

278
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Hey, leave it!

279
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,339
- Sieg Heil!
- Sieg Heil!

280
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,859
Tony!
Wait a minute! How do you like this?

281
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,300
- Nice!
- Come on!

282
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:13,619
We'll see how it goes.
It's hot. Pick up!

283
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,859
Wait a minute!

284
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,099
A gift from me.

285
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:40,899
- Police!
- A miracle!

286
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,139
To stop!

287
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:45,099
Come on, after them! Hagedorn!

288
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,139
- To stop! We will catch them.
- Come on! They are there! Kuschke!

289
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,780
To stop! Wait!

290
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Benny, come on!

291
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,940
Open the door!
Open it, you bastard!

292
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:09,579
Damn it!

293
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,339
Come!

294
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:22,220
Benny, no!

295
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,780
Come on, Toni, come on!

296
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:28,220
- I'll take you.
- Good.

297
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,619
Come!

298
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,980
My goodness!

299
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:38,460
Are you bored with your life?

300
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:43,180
Come in!

301
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,500
Kuschke, come on! From the other side.
We'll catch them from the other side.

302
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,780
- Kuschke!
- Don't look down!

303
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,859
- Will succeed.
- I do not watch.

304
00:24:56,859 --> 00:25:01,980
We'll celebrate later, just
the two of us, really. Hold on!

305
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,940
Co-workers! Come on!
They're out on the roof.

306
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,339
- What are you doing there?
- Nothing.

307
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,940
It's all the work of a gang of shoplifters.
By the time we got here, everything had been taken.

308
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,460
As the commander of police station number 14,
I will say this.

309
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:20,899
And this is
unanimously supported by all the police officers present.

310
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,540
Or maybe not?

311
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,700
- Good, but now to the roof!
- We're going on the back stairs.

312
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,339
Look, what a tragedy, Wegener!

313
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,059
Of course, he is not the man in his
prime,

314
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,859
who makes a young frustrum
ape.

315
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:20,419
- What does he want?
- The SA is rioting at Ku'damm.

316
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,059
isn't it

317
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:25,260
There are many of them, they are hunting civilians.

318
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:28,059
This is not our competence.

319
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:32,460
It seems that the SA rebelled against
the party leadership of the NSDAP.

320
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,059
The police did not intervene.
At least so far...

321
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,379
Come!

322
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,819
- What kind of assholes are you?
- We have to get down!

323
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,180
That's not gonna work. It's full of cops.

324
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,180
- Cops?
- Let's go, Benni! Leave it!

325
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,439
- Let me go, you scumbag!
- Where are the cops?

326
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
They are there!

327
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,780
Police! To stop!

328
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,940
- To stop!
- Here they are.

329
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:20,180
Stop! To stop!

330
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:25,619
Come in! Come!

331
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,859
I'll stay up here.

332
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,940
I'll check on the fire escape.
Two go down!

333
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
Be careful!

334
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,099
- I'll make you one right now.
- Go!

335
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,500
Tune in!

336
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:52,419
Wait! I won't leave Benni alone.

337
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:56,579
- What's your name?
- To Toni.

338
00:27:58,139 --> 00:27:59,659
- And you?
- To Moritz.

339
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:10,220
To stop!

340
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,099
Come here with the booty!

341
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,619
Benny!

342
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,300
Please do not!

343
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,260
Damn it! Stop!

344
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:20,540
Stop!

345
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,619
Homicide, this is
Criminal Assistant Ritter speaking,

346
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,579
Thanks, we're coming!

347
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,579
Inspector General?

348
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,220
Did you hear
me say "come in"?

349
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:52,059
Excuse me, Inspector General,

350
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:55,460
there has been a fatal burglary
on Wittenbergplatz, we are needed.

351
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:05,859
- Go on!
- Did you hear what I said? Next!

352
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,020
I would also ask the lady
to go on.

353
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,020
Böhm, district "A". Are you the witnesses?

354
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,139
- Yes.
- Who are you?

355
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,740
I'm Sergeant Naumann,
Chief Inspector.

356
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:24,419
He is the commander of the 14th police station.

357
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,099
Did you see how it happened?

358
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,180
Yes, but not only me,
but also half the crew.

359
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,780
It was a gang of shoplifters, clearly.

360
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,700
What's going on there?

361
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,819
How did it happen?

362
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:46,700
It slipped. On the run.

363
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:53,059
- What did they find on him?
- Nothing.

364
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,460
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

365
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,379
But it was a burglary, wasn't it?

366
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,619
One of his accomplices must
have taken the loot.

367
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,339
How many accomplices were there?

368
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:03,020
- Sergeant Naumann!
- Forgive me!

369
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:05,700
There were four boys, I think,
but they were unrecognizable.

370
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,899
- And a girl.
- A girl?

371
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,020
Yes, a redhead.
He also had a backpack, I saw.

372
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:19,220
Naumann! Human!
We need your people!

373
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,020
You see, Inspector General,
we need every man.

374
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,940
I will send a couple of colleagues over tomorrow
to reconstruct the events.

375
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,099
- Police officer 14, right?
- Number 14. Come on boys!

376
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:34,099
Okay, take him to pathology!

377
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,579
- One moment, Chief Inspector.
- From me…

378
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:38,579
Take a few more quick photos.

379
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,180
Toni

380
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,260
- Wait a minute!
- Fräulein Ritter!

381
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:15,980
Toni!

382
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:18,180
Toni, stop!

383
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,379
Toni!

384
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:33,379
Tony, wait!

385
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,419
Those cops over there, let's get out of here!
People! The cops are here!

386
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,419
How long has the operation been going on?

387
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:38,659
They seem to have just arrived.

388
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,180
- But why so late?
- I'll ask.

389
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:51,819
According to the officer leading the operation,
the situation is under control.

390
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,740
It starts the action.

391
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:57,940
Lead the main columnist!

392
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:02,980
Lead columnist to the front!

393
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,419
How soon we'll see each other again!

394
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,780
Take me away!

395
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:55,379
Surprise!

396
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,899
Dear esteemed guests!
It is a great honor for us,

397
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:04,339
that they all came to us

398
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:08,060
to celebrate
New Year's Eve together.

399
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,419
Last year was also
extremely eventful,

400
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:14,300
both in the world
and in our lives,

401
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,019
on a very private level.

402
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,819
Alfred
recently surprised me with a meeting,

403
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:24,459
the consequences of which
we want to celebrate with you now.

404
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:29,819
We intended it as a surprise,
even for you, dear Annemarie.

405
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:33,339
The meeting
took place at the registry office.

406
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:36,700
Yes! We got married!

407
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,100
Bravo! This is amazing!

408
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,700
Bravo! Long live the newlyweds!

409
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:45,899
Wegener!
Come over to me tomorrow! Already in the morning.

410
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:50,379
- Urgent action is needed.
- With pleasure.

411
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,939
Thanks!

412
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,180
Excellencies, distinguished ladies
and gentlemen, my dear friends!

413
00:35:58,979 --> 00:36:05,419
The past year, 1930, can already
be said to be of historical importance.

414
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:11,019
One of us... Namely you,
dear Herr Brüning,

415
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,220
he has been Chancellor of the Empire for nine months now .

416
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,260
During this time

417
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:21,220
managed to thoroughly clean up
the republican mess in our country.

418
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,220
It was a pleasure to watch,
and it is still a great pleasure to see

419
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,260
as he did so.

420
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,939
So what should come next?

421
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:41,499
After our relationship
turned out to be so… fruitful?

422
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,060
What's coming now?

423
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,780
After nine months?

424
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,180
Now comes the birth!

425
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,379
It is a dirty process that involves
blood,

426
00:36:58,459 --> 00:37:04,419
involves sweat and pain!
They call it labor for a reason.

427
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:11,419
which helps us to live. Labor,
with which we announce a new era,

428
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:18,580
out of the darkness, through the blood,
into the light! For the new era!

429
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,700
For the new era!

430
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,539
Long live Germany!

431
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,539
Long live Germany!

432
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:32,100
Let's reach for the stars and beyond!
Let's think big

433
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,100
more than any other nation!

434
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,939
We will be the first on the moon!

435
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:04,019
Now you may be wondering
how long this will take.

436
00:38:04,419 --> 00:38:08,539
Well, I'm proud to say
that the first person,

437
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,060
whoever will step on the moon
already lives here among us.

438
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,140
This man…

439
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,060
That person will be me.

440
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:33,539
Helga!

441
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:39,780
It's almost midnight,
let's count down together,

442
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,859
when I give the signal!

443
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:48,499
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

444
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:53,100
six, five, four, three,

445
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:55,180
two, one…

446
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:49,419
This day is worth gold
In my veins there are 100,000 volts of heaven

447
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:53,620
And the velvety night caresses me softly

448
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,260
This day is worth its weight in gold

449
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,899
It has everything you could ask for

450
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,140
Night couldn't be more beautiful than this

451
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:08,220
Two left
, then back and forward, so good

452
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,700
Dance up
Now or never, it's so inviting

453
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,819
Everything is alive and kicking, come on
Renegade, are we crazy?

454
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,939
Herr Wegener,
where can I make a phone call here, please?

455
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,859
- Follow me!
- Thank you.

456
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,019
And the velvety night caresses me softly

457
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,740
Is life just a dream?

458
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:53,499
It would be nice, but I can already see
It's hardly true

459
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,260
I know, it's only thin consolation

460
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,060
Everything changes
Nothing is the same anymore

461
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,300
Happy New Year!

462
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,819
Greetings to Moscow
, Paris, Vienna

463
00:41:34,899 --> 00:41:37,220
People
only talk about Berlin these days

464
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,620
Flirting, perversity
Many heptians are no longer controversial

465
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,979
We all went crazy

466
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,140
This day is worth its weight in gold

467
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,180
What we dance is a razor's edge

468
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,660
One flash, and there's nothing left.
Only glitter, let's ring together!

469
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,780
Yes, I want an overseas connection.

470
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,060
Speak!

471
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,740
236 Brooklyn , New York, United States .

472
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,180
The connection will be established in 30 minutes.

473
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,700
- Did they set you up?
- It seems so.

474
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,379
Good morning!

475
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,379
Miss Seegers!

476
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,979
I was worried you wouldn't come.

477
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,019
You just disappeared.

478
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:37,620
Shouldn't I have had
more fun?

479
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:42,660
Because of my work... I was
invited to an action...

480
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,819
Hello, who's talking?

481
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,979
This is Jacob Grün from Berlin.
Is that you, Avrum?

482
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,700
Yes. Why are you calling?

483
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:24,140
Now listen to me carefully!

484
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,819
I know
where your late father's diamond is.

485
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:34,580
What are you talking about?

486
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,220
Well, about the blue Rothschild.

487
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,339
Here!

488
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,019
In Berlin!

489
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,580
