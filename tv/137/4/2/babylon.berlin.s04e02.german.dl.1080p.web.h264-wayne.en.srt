00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:18,720
BABYLON BERLIN SEASON
4, PART 2

2
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,159
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY VOLKER
KUTSCHER

3
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,080
Come here to us!

4
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,320
Let's sing your favorite song!

5
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,199
Stennes.

6
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,800
Priority belongs to the elderly.

7
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,199
Comrades, see you outside.

8
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,600
Would you like to escort me out personally,
Mr. Government Counselor?

9
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:23,720
On the contrary.

10
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,360
I wanted to see it closer

11
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:31,639
where you will be staying in the coming
weeks or perhaps months.

12
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,079
I'll be out again tomorrow.

13
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:43,360
For that, someone would have to know
that he is inside.

14
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,239
That he's still inside.

15
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,079
What exactly did you want to achieve
with your little rebellion, Lieutenant Stennes?

16
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,160
To bring the traitors of the movement
to the wall as soon as possible.

17
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,400
Traitors like you.

18
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,999
As soon as the public finds out
how much of a pervert he is dealing with,

19
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,160
you can immediately resign from the
leadership of the political police, Wendt.

20
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,639
And I will inform
the public about this.

21
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:31,199
I overcame this… illness
a long time ago.

22
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,800
Come on!

23
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:54,319
Move, gentlemen!

24
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,319
What did Stennes say?

25
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,999
He just brought up
some old stories. Nothing more.

26
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,079
- Happy New Year, Senior!
- Ah, Junior. You too!

27
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,360
- Is there anything interesting in it?
- Read it yourself!

28
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,840
Page six.

29
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,920
"Death struck at midnight"

30
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:48,319
"Are National
Socialists behind the band of thieves?"

31
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,960
- What happened?
- It wasn't us!

32
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,119
- Then who?
- Two tramps!

33
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,160
- They were up on the roof!
- Tramps?

34
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,239
One fell.

35
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,840
They want to beat us! I do not believe it!

36
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,160
Read this!
It sounds quite different here.

37
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,720
You are heroes in this.

38
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,280
"Wake up Germany!"

39
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:17,759
- Where else did you go after that?
- To celebrate. With comrades. And you?

40
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,040
Me too.

41
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,040
- Your case?
- What?

42
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:30,679
The dead boy from the department store.

43
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,920
I do not think so. Late
technical colleagues deal with that.

44
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,599
Has anyone been arrested?

45
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,839
I do not know. Do you really want to be a police officer?

46
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,640
That's out of the question.

47
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,400
- When does your train leave?
- In an hour.

48
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,719
Can I take another bath before that?

49
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,599
Is there no water in the boarding school?

50
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,120
There is only cold water.

51
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,880
POLICE STATION NO. 14
BERLIN-CHARLOTTENBURG

52
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,199
- Not here.
- Who is he?

53
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,640
Well, the red-haired girl.

54
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,240
He saw everything. We have to find it.

55
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,559
I'm going to the sewers, you're going to
the black market, and you're going to the shelter.

56
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,280
Well, you're finally here!

57
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,439
- Where is Benny?
- There is no more Benni.

58
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,400
Those
scumbags from police station 14 got him!

59
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,599
- What do you mean?
- Benni is dead.

60
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:07,199
- Did he die during the burglary?
- Yes.

61
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,079
- And what did you get from there?
- Nothing.

62
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,679
The break-in failed.

63
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,040
I don't believe a word you say.

64
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:20,839
I don't have anything, I swear.

65
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,719
I have nothing!

66
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,319
Are you coming here empty handed?

67
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,800
Who do you think you are?

68
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,920
He's not the first to throw up his feet.

69
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,000
Stop whining!
I'm the guy here now!

70
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,719
That's it, take it away, you bastard!

71
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,839
Then don't post your picture here anymore!

72
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,800
Miss!

73
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,319
Táncmaraton!

74
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,559
Dance marathon at Moka Efti!
The main prize is 1000 marks!

75
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,800
Táncmaraton!

76
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,479
Do you want one? In Moka Efti
, you can win 1000 marks in a week.

77
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,199
Lottchen, come, look!

78
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,719
Doris, do you have a new job?

79
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,719
In a dance marathon, you can win 1000 marks.

80
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,839
1000 marks?

81
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
The most persistent lady wins.
Are you applying?

82
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,319
- When will it be?
- I guess in a week.

83
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,280
- You have time to practice.
- I'm asking for time off.

84
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,599
Anyway,
the Buddha is there for you anyway.

85
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,120
Okay, I'll ask.
I want to dance again.

86
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:35,520
What about tobacco?

87
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,520
If I win, we'll split, okay?

88
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:39,640
- What if I?
- 70-30 for you?

89
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,800
All right.

90
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:45,760
Dance marathon! You can win 1000 marks!

91
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,880
Dance marathon at Moka Efti!
The prize is 1,000 marks.

92
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:04,880
- Ah, Rath! Very good!
- Mr. Criminal Counselor!

93
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,160
- Happy New Year!
- You too, sir!

94
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,520
How did you spend last night?

95
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,920
Why?

96
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,800
The boss wants to talk to you.
It seemed urgent to him.

97
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,120
- Right now?
- No, it's in the parliament. Later.

98
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:19,599
Come on!

99
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:25,959
Sorry, gentlemen! I have to
deliver this to homicide here.

100
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,959
- They're up there.
- On the fourth.

101
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,599
Thank you sir.

102
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,079
Speaking of which, there's a new case.
First murder of the year.

103
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,040
- Do you command?
- I've never been here before.

104
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,079
Maybe I'll meet
someone important here.

105
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,439
Hell, let's take the stairs!
My doctor recommended more exercise.

106
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,880
Come!

107
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,120
"The 14th
police squad responsible for public safety"

108
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,520
"he also mentioned an unknown
person at the crime scene."

109
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:52,160
"Hagedorn: 'What about the red-haired girl'."

110
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:02,719
"Kuschke:
'No, he is not one of them'."

111
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,400
Will we still make it to lunch today?

112
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,559
Enjoy your meal!

113
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,839
- Greetings, gentlemen!
- You too, young man!

114
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,040
He hit the delt.
Just sit nicely outside!

115
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,959
Wait! I have yet to deliver this.

116
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,439
What is this?

117
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,640
A lady
found a cup of tea in the women's section.

118
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:20,319
Where that boy fell from the roof.

119
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,439
Yeah. Thank You!

120
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:25,520
Step down!

121
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,120
It sucks!

122
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:31,839
Who was that?

123
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,120
A catwalk boy
from Tietz Áruház, a pipe boy.

124
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,800
Give it to me, I'll take it to the trace analysts!

125
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
No need, we'll fix it.

126
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,400
Of course,
I have to go to pathology anyway.

127
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,479
Thanks!

128
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,800
- Let's just go to lunch!
- Well, we're hungry.

129
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,760
But here's the penalty work
at the 14th floor.

130
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,280
- My condolences.
- Yes, thank you.

131
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,959
Likewise.

132
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,079
He sat there like a drunk
who fell asleep on a park bench.

133
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,079
Has the deceased been identified yet?

134
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,800
Based on his documents,
the deceased Friedhelm Oelschläger,

135
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,959
59 years old, municipal civil servant.

136
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,679
Have relatives been notified yet?

137
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,959
Your wife
is waiting for you down there in pathology.

138
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,599
Or so! So I have to go down again?

139
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,800
Thank you for accompanying me.
I have to go to the moral police.

140
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,559
Ms Oelschläger?

141
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,920
Come!

142
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,160
This is Dr. Schwarz,
head of pathology.

143
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,079
We can start with me.

144
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,680
He is.

145
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,040
- Her husband?
- Yes.

146
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,119
Friedhelm Oelschläger?
59 years old, Berlin city official.

147
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,559
Again.

148
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,879
My sincere condolences, Frau Oelschläger.
My colleagues are waiting for you upstairs.

149
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,919
His testimony will be recorded.

150
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,240
Go to Inspectorate "A", please.

151
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,240
What caused his death?

152
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:49,399
First, he drank a lot,
his blood alcohol level was 2.3,

153
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,800
and ate a lot. Scrambled
eggs, butter, bread, caviar,

154
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,800
moreover, it was in Malossol. The better kind!
All this in huge quantities.

155
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,599
Ah, here comes Fräulein Ritter!
I wish you a happy new year!

156
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,359
- Did you have a good New Year's Eve?
- Wonderful.

157
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,079
Or so.

158
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,800
As I mentioned, it was brought in today…

159
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:20,559
Lottchen! What an honor!

160
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:23,119
- Happy New Year!
- Hello, Rudi! You too!

161
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,319
- How far did you get?
- I just started it.

162
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,480
It's not easy
with a boy like that.

163
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,359
who fell 15 meters from the roof.

164
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,879
Listen to this!
Shortly before that,

165
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,319
how did you get here with the councilwoman, I...

166
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:37,720
When was the last time we were
left to ourselves?

167
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Again?

168
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:43,280
As for the cause of death:
a precise cut to the throat.

169
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,520
The perpetrator knew exactly
how to do it.

170
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,480
Other clues?

171
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,520
I'm afraid
it's the work of an expert.

172
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,800
Okay, then thank you in advance.

173
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,440
Tehát

174
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,119
Male corpse, age: about 16-18 years,

175
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,200
head injury, various
bone fractures in the arm and leg,

176
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,639
starvation edema, which
suggests malnutrition.

177
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,079
Worms and scabies,
so-called street scars.

178
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:13,359
More than likely
he has been homeless for years.

179
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,240
Syphilis,
secondary stage, is added to this.

180
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,359
How come?

181
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,480
It's almost inevitable.
They scurry like rabbits.

182
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,440
Bone fractures
can be explained by falls,

183
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,520
but this injury here… not really.

184
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,720
This refers to the influence of an external force.

185
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,800
- Really?
- Yes… I would say…

186
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,599
Aha.

187
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,559
Na, me, sixth… igen.

188
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,000
Allow me,
dear assistant colleague,

189
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,960
that
I might take a look at it too?

190
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,559
I would, of course.

191
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,919
We will apply if we
can provide results instead of speculation.

192
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,240
All right.

193
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,520
Charlotte

194
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,599
- Charlotte!
- Mi van?

195
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,000
We need to talk!

196
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,079
You're welcome, with the Inspector Rath
I know!

197
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,159
If you happen to run into him,
please let me know!

198
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,040
What do you mean by that? Just because I hold certain
political views,

199
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,440
- I haven't become a different person yet!
- But!

200
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,280
Innocent people are
beaten in the open street,

201
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,319
what does this have to do with political views?

202
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Jews are not innocent!

203
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,200
What did they do?

204
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,399
They alone benefit from the crisis.

205
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,359
While the German people are
starving and cold

206
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,399
in their own country!
We don't want to accept it like this anymore.

207
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,359
I don't even know you anymore.

208
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:48,200
You think you're a policeman! He
should take care of order and security.

209
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,520
That's what we do! But about the right
security, the right order.

210
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,359
From the inside! Not about
something that is forced upon us from the outside.

211
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,240
The whole foundation is corrupt and rotten!

212
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,960
We have to tear it down
and rebuild it from the ground up!

213
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
For who?

214
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,000
To all decent citizens!

215
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:04,159
- And for him in there?
- To whom, the boy?

216
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,559
- Yes.
- Not for him.

217
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,319
But he and others like him are starving,
that's why they steal. They are not criminals!

218
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:10,720
But, they are the scum!

219
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,359
What?

220
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,879
That was!

221
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:23,040
You are dead to me, Herr Rath.
He died and was buried.

222
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,359
Please, after being notified yesterday,

223
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,760
I could easily drive
from the suburbs to the city center,

224
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,919
to watch
the police finally arrive

225
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
almost a full hour
late to the venue,

226
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,319
to ensure order.

227
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:56,079
What are you talking about?

228
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:00,359
Why am I not
initiated into the processes,

229
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,520
that
directly affect my department?

230
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,399
Mr. Chief of Police, Mr.
Government Counsellor. Do I disturb?

231
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,119
No, come in!

232
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,119
- Did they want to talk to me?
- That's right!

233
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,960
Could you please tell me
what the hell got into you?

234
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,240
If you are referring to my involvement in yesterday's events …

235
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,639
A police officer of this rank
should be aware of

236
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,639
that is completely
outrageous in public

237
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,240
to appear as a member of the Sturmabteilung
!

238
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,280
- Chief of Police...
- Don't interrupt!

239
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:38,639
He was seen
harassing unsuspecting citizens,

240
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,159
and willfully destroy
their stores! And actively!

241
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:46,319
Do you know Walther Stennes well?

242
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,800
I know it, of course,
but I can't say that it's good.

243
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,399
Why are you asking?

244
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,040
Because then
his political commitment

245
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,919
at least it could be of use to us.

246
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,879
The supervisor must urgently limit
his political involvement!

247
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,559
Otherwise,
his days with the Berlin Police are numbered.

248
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,280
You, the social democrats,
cannot be helped.

249
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,800
Even then, they would not be able to take advantage
of the possibility of covert surveillance,

250
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,280
if it were right in front of their noses.

251
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,599
We will not declare SA
our enemy.

252
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,159
Stennes is just a small fish.

253
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,520
The real problem is in Munich.

254
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,319
I think this is a huge mistake,
Chief Constable.

255
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:30,440
I recommend myself.

256
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,599
Come!

257
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,800
I had to be responsible for some secret operations,

258
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,919
but for something that happened yesterday…

259
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:03,000
Which you fell right
in the middle of...

260
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,319
Was it really necessary for him
to show himself so openly?

261
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,240
I had no choice. It
would have been impossible with such an action

262
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:17,639
to hide in the second row.
Stennes would have been suspicious.

263
00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:21,720
It was the only way
I could keep his trust.

264
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,720
That was a tough deployment, Rath.
I owe you a debt of gratitude.

265
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,399
Good afternoon.

266
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,800
Oh my God, Toni! You look
like a boy. Are you scabies?

267
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:53,559
Just a precaution.
Because of rats like you.

268
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,200
- What you got?
- Something shiny.

269
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,480
- Where did you get this?
- I'm just selling.

270
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,480
- For commission fee.
- Are you fooling me?

271
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,319
Do we agree or not?

272
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Let's go, it's not my level anymore.
Do you still accept ads?

273
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,800
Maybe. Looking for something specific?

274
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:25,879
Sure, widows are the best.

275
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,359
They have everything you
want. Guba, silver cutlery...

276
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,800
Just look in the newspaper!
They are always looking for tenants.

277
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,399
Well, my child, you will
come with me now, okay?

278
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,760
Stop!

279
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,599
To stop!

280
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:08,200
Stop!

281
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,599
To stop!

282
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:27,440
Stop! To stop!

283
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,399
Stop the thief! To stop!

284
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,440
Hold it!

285
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,960
Thanks! Hey, hey!

286
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,879
Well, girl, you're done now.

287
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,040
Now let's go to the castle.

288
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:46,399
Then, when you fall into Kuschke's hands,

289
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
he will wring your neck well,
you little luvnya!

290
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,599
I'll take a good look at it!

291
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,919
Even with pleasure.
With the greatest possible pleasure.

292
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,119
Then I bent down
and held out my hand to him,

293
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,399
and he reached for it and…

294
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,879
- Which hand?
- The better.

295
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,399
Then it slipped.

296
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,440
Well, now you can get to know us.

297
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,280
Is that the red-haired girl from the department store?

298
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,240
- So, is that him?
- It's hard to say...

299
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,559
ULLSTEINHAUS, "TEMPO"
EDITORIAL, BERLIN-MITTE

300
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,440
Sorry, Mr. Editor-in-Chief,
people are waiting for you.

301
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,599
All right, Potocznik.

302
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,760
They argued for two days and two nights,

303
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,119
they just figured something out with it.

304
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,159
Until they shut
down the whole kennel…

305
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,839
Ah, it's starting.

306
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,760
What could be wrong?

307
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,599
Sing jó…

308
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:45,359
My speech will be short and painful.

309
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,000
I know I was expected

310
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,079
that after the negotiations
I will come up with positive results.

311
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,280
But unfortunately, the situation
is exactly the opposite.

312
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,200
A year ago
, the global economy collapsed,

313
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,040
and we have been trying to avoid
the waves of this upheaval for a long time.

314
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,480
I'll keep it short: the publisher has
to save money, drastically

315
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,960
therefore, we are reducing the number of our employees by
50 percent.

316
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,520
This means we
are laying off half of all our employees.

317
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:21,440
I know this affects you badly
and I am extremely sorry.

318
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,919
I wish I had something else
to announce to you…

319
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,680
But there it is.

320
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,839
Perhaps in a year,
the world will show its most beautiful face again.

321
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,240
Herr Potocznik will
explain the details to you.

322
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,599
Fräulein Sommer
immediately hangs out a list.

323
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,200
Anyone whose name is on it
will be fired.

324
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,040
Please for proof of employment

325
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,440
report to the staff office
in the next few days.

326
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,319
And please don't come at the same time,
okay? Let them command.

327
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,720
- Miss Knight?
- Igen?

328
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:23,960
I think we need you
in interrogation room 4.

329
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,800
On me? And what about Böhm?

330
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:32,200
Unable to reach. Anyway, I think you
are the right person for this.

331
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,599
We brought the girl
from police station 14 from colleagues,

332
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,879
but he doesn't say anything. He doesn't say a word.

333
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,879
We thought
maybe his tongue would be more flexible,

334
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,040
if questioned by a lady.
Command me.

335
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,240
At least sit down!

336
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:55,800
- This is Ritter's colleague.
- Good to have you here!

337
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:58,839
Stubborn as a mule.
He won't even reveal his name.

338
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,760
I think it would be best
if they left the witness alone.

339
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,000
- We're waiting outside.
- Yes, in the corridor.

340
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Would you leave the cigarette here? Please!

341
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,200
But remember,
we are very pressed for time!

342
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,399
Otherwise, we will anger the Buddha.

343
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,559
How tall are you!
You've grown a lot in a year.

344
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,879
What happened to your hair?

345
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,280
- Do you want one?
- I do not smoke.

346
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,520
Toni, what happened?

347
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,440
Let it go, Lotte,
you're not going to get anything out of me.

348
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,800
You'd better initiate, because we
could both be in trouble, you know?

349
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,119
- You?
- Yes me!

350
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,440
Well, don't make me laugh!
You are one of them.

351
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,639
- Among whom?
- To the cops! Among the hounds!

352
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,319
You all play together!

353
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,079
I risked my own head for you!

354
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,240
- Aha!
- Yes!

355
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,680
But how?

356
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,680
I withheld evidence,
I falsified a confession because of you!

357
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,599
- You're good at lying together, aren't you?
- Stop it!

358
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,359
Toni!

359
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,760
Murderers! You killed him!

360
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,159
- Tony!
- You killed Benni!

361
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,359
You are the one! Tony!

362
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,479
Hey!

363
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,720
To separate!

364
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,760
- Miss Knight!
- Nyugodj le!

365
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,600
- We didn't really think like that.
- I know.

366
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,680
We must have been wrong.

367
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,080
I'll do it.

368
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:24,959
Sorry. I'm Renate.

369
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,999
He wants to apologize to himself!

370
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,999
Accept it, Fräulein!

371
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,800
We're late! This is going to be a problem.

372
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,959
It's not even small! Come!

373
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:45,839
Sit down and wait!

374
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,839
Wait a minute,
I think I should...

375
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,200
Well, if you have to…

376
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,120
But did you manage to pull yourself together?

377
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,640
- Yes.
- Soon then.

378
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,919
New year, new case. Could you outline
the case for us, colleague Rath?

379
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Gentlemen, the deceased's name is
Friedhelm Oelschläger. 59 years old,

380
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,760
public administration official.
It was delivered at seven o'clock this morning.

381
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,879
His wife claims

382
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:57,399
that the husband was responsible for associations at the municipality .

383
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:59,080
It was his job to decide

384
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,160
whether an association
can be considered non-profit or not.

385
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,160
- What else?
- This was found on the dead man here.

386
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,760
Seven applications for nonprofit status for
1931.

387
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:12,319
None of them have been processed yet.

388
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,839
It would also be quite unusual for
a city clerk

389
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:19,560
would process applications on New Year's Day, and
more at once.

390
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:23,680
Oelschläger
was by no means a typical official.

391
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,560
At least his lifestyle far
exceeded his official salary.

392
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,120
Food worth hundreds of marks was found in his stomach alone.

393
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,959
- Any suspicions?
- Yes.

394
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,999
We all know the applicants well.

395
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,720
They are the
leaders of the biggest clubs in the city.

396
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,200
Az Evergreen, a Berolina, a Rixdorfer,
a Dragonfly, az Apache Blood,

397
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,080
a German oakIt's a Central German club.

398
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,359
This is almost
all the thugs here.

399
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,600
Ah, Fräulein Charlotte, did you sleep well?

400
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,760
- I'm sorry, I just...
- Please take a seat!

401
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,160
I am glad that we can have you
in our ranks in the new year as well.

402
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,839
All right, inspector, these
so-called association leaders

403
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:12,760
take them all under scrutiny
and examine them thoroughly!

404
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,359
Colleagues know where it
is easiest to catch up with the gentlemen.

405
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,640
Then let's move on:
gang of shoplifters.

406
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,600
Dead man at Tietz Store.
Where is Böhm anyway?

407
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,519
- I do not know.
- Nobody knows.

408
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
No one.

409
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,200
Well, Fräulein Charlotte,
then you are the only one among us,

410
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,760
who can
report to us directly from the crime scene.

411
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:35,839
Again.

412
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:40,600
- I mean, not quite.
- Here you go?

413
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,720
Inspector Rath was also there.
Although he was not acting on an official matter.

414
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,919
Really?

415
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:51,240
He was one of the leaders of the SA
during the riots at Ku'damm.

416
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:06,280
Are you a member of the Sturmabteilung, supervisor?

417
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,200
Again.

418
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,919
Well then, he obviously had
more important things to do than

419
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:14,039
than to support Fräulein Ritter

420
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,560
in the police investigation
at the Tietz Department Store.

421
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,479
So:
burglary with fatal outcome...

422
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,039
It's already been doneto ask the other colleagues

423
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,519
...from police officer No. 14.

424
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,560
Yes, their testimony
matches that of Kuschke's colleague.

425
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,319
The boy slipped while running away.

426
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:34,439
But the autopsy report
has not been completed yet.

427
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,200
- Has it been identified yet?
- Not yet.

428
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:41,439
But we detained a witness
whose testimony

429
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,720
we hope it will provide more
details about the case.

430
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:50,160
Böhm's colleague!
Recently, he does not consider it important,

431
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,240
to report on your own case?

432
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:53,959
On the contrary, Mr. Criminal Counsel.

433
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:57,519
I managed to solve the store case.

434
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,640
Well, then get off your ass!

435
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,600
This morning
, a jacket was sent to us from the Tietz store,

436
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,640
which the perpetrators
left behind at the crime scene.

437
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:13,640
Well... yes... We took it off, that is, I took
the jacket off to the trace analysis colleagues.

438
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,399
That must have been his intention.

439
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,519
I just wonder
why the coat never got there.

440
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:22,560
Maybe Miss Crime Assistant
can shed some light on this mystery?

441
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:23,879
What do you want with this, Böhm?

442
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:25,999
I can speak for myself , thank you.

443
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:30,080
He doesn't say anything
because he can't say anything to that!

444
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,120
I'll join Inspector Rath,
what do you want to do, Böhm?

445
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,879
Fräulein Ritter,
is this the coat you sent over?

446
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:44,839
- Well?
- Böhm, refine my tone!

447
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,800
We know this jacket. Everyone
here knows this jacket well.

448
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:52,519
Ritter's colleague used
to wear it almost every day.

449
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,080
This is a casual jacket
from Tietz's leftover stock.

450
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,560
Many women have bought from him,
only I know two.

451
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,919
Is it yours or not?

452
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,240
Not mine.

453
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,959
If Fräulein Charlotte says that,
she means it, doesn't she?

454
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,120
But maybe he'd rather
say it's his.

455
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:23,800
This is a receipt from the hygiene station in the Wedding district of Berlin .

456
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:27,959
Forced
disinfection due to lice and lice infestation,

457
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:30,760
which
was issued in the name of Antonie Ritter.

458
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,200
Isn't Antonie Ritter
your sister, Fräulein Ritter?

459
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,800
And is it possible
that her sister has red hair?

460
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,080
Charlotte?

461
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,760
Just like the witness,
who is a colleague of Henning and Czerwinski

462
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,080
did he take me to interrogation room 4,
if I heard correctly?

463
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,319
Was that her sister?

464
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:03,399
It probably was, but
an even more important question arises:

465
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,120
Where is your sister now?

466
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:10,800
According to the policeman on guard duty
, he was able to escape alone

467
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:14,039
from the preliminary arrest,
from the closed interrogation room,

468
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,120
even after
Criminal Assistant Ritter,

469
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,120
that he spoke to you face to face.

470
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,839
That's why I ask again:
Where is your sister now?

471
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:33,359
By removing the coat, he withheld clearly
incriminating evidence,

472
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:36,839
to divert suspicion from her sister,
which I have now proved!

473
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,359
And make no doubt,

474
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,319
I will also prove
that he helped his sister escape.

475
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:48,120
You can take poison for that.

476
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,359
This is true?

477
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,080
Did he really remove the jacket to withhold
evidence?

478
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,519
Did you know about it yourself?

479
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,160
Please wait in my office.

480
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:30,160
Gentlemen, as unfortunate as it is,
we have to do our job.

481
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,839
I thank you.

482
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,720
- Mr. Criminal Counselor, I...
- Please take a seat.

483
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,080
Fräulein Ritter, I have no choice because of your behavior .

484
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:14,479
Your employment does not fall
under the scope of public service law,

485
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,479
thus the suspension
and the subsequent disciplinary procedure

486
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,240
not possible in your case.

487
00:44:20,479 --> 00:44:23,120
The gravity of the offense is clear.

488
00:44:24,479 --> 00:44:25,879
I have to fire you.

489
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,600
What?

490
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,280
It is impossible for him to return to the
bonds of the criminal police service.

491
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,680
Your benefits will end today.

492
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,160
I don't hide that with his behavior

493
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,160
I was personally
very disappointed.

494
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,399
I thought you would
make a good police officer.

495
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,760
But it seems I was wrong.

496
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,039
Burn with you!

497
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,879
One more thing.

498
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,120
Again?

499
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,280
Your badge, please!

500
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,800
I would like you
to take over Fräulein Ritter's duties for the time being.

501
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,519
Is this really the final decision?

502
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:18,080
It looks very much like that.

503
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,959
TALI FILM THEATER

504
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:29,479
Well, did you get the leave?

505
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:36,160
No.

506
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,160
But now it's time, like the sea.

507
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,999
