Just help me study my tests,

187
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,713

from his skin,

via the rod, to his brain.

Rod tore through the skin.

The infection ate away
at the bones in his c-spine

and allowed the rod to come loose.

Could cause any amount of damage
to his muscle, vessels...

424
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:14,264
It could've pushed
through his esophagus,

than any brain infection.

And then he developed a huge GI bleed,

in the ICU. Take a look.

00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:34,347
When I was lying in Savasana,

480
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:36,216
I found myself thinking about your dream

481
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:38,217
of being a mother, no matter what.

482

- How was your shift?

490
00:19:58,275 --> 00:19:59,672

that is our broken system

492

- while trying not to get sued.
- Mm.

493
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:05,277
There was one interesting case,

494
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,512
- and Hundley brought muffins.
- Hmm.

495
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:08,784
Ready to flee?

496
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,183
I have bad news.

497
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:13,318
- No. Why?
- I can't.

498
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:14,552
Nathan called out.

499
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:16,455
- Oh.
- So I have to stay,

500
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,425
but you should still go
rock climbing without me.

501
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,958
- Yeah.
- Which really is a wise move anyway

502
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:22,760
since I primarily stay earthbound

503
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,896
and I just watch you,
praying that you don't fall

504
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:26,698
and shatter every bone in your body.

505
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:29,000
I never fall. I mean, fall-fall.

506
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:31,202
Everyone does eventually.

507
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:35,472
I mean, we're not old,
but we're not young either.

508
00:20:35,477 --> 00:20:38,475
I'm just saying, if you didn't
fall, you wouldn't bounce.

509
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,211
- Ha!
- Just keep in mind

510
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:41,979
the consequences, okay? And be careful.

511
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:44,716
Okay. I think I might just stick around.

512
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:47,218
Really? 'Cause I could be several hours.

513
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:49,253
There's this case I'm curious about.

514
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:51,988
Could shed some light on how
to be able to climb rock walls

515

like a young mountain goat
for years to come.

516
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,596
He told me he wore that bandage to keep

517
00:20:58,601 --> 00:20:59,763
his surgical scar clean.

518
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:02,133
He wore it the entire time
we were together.

519
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:04,835
Two years.

520
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,738
You must think I'm so stupid.

521
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:09,440
No.

522
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:12,576
Raja's got us all thinking about denial.

523
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,945
Mm-hmm. My own fiancé.

524
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,014
I knew how much he hated
talking about hard things.

525
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,684
I asked him once about his cancer

526
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:23,654
and whether he still needed
to see doctors regularly,

527
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:24,722
and he told me no,

528
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:26,423
he was all better.

529
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:28,826
What do I know? I believed him.

530
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:31,828
This isn't your fault.

531
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,597
What matters is what we do next.

532
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:36,866
Raja can't speak for himself anymore,

533
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:40,039
and he designated you to make
his medical decisions.

534
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:43,943
Wow, uh, okay.

535
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,982
- Tell me.
- He's gonna need surgery.

536
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:54,885
The rod that stabilized his spine

537
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,120
pushed through his esophagus, so

538
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,122
our thoracic surgeon will need to work

539
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:01,124
with our spine surgeon to remove it.

540
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,663
And if you're successful, he'll be okay?

541
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:12,769
The surgery's dangerous.

542
00:22:13,574 --> 00:22:16,172
Life-threatening.

543
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:19,009
And if he lives,

544
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:23,045
he will not be the same.

545
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,783
There's a chance he might not
be able to eat again or...

546
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:29,352
talk again

547
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:31,454
or breathe on his own.

548
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:33,422
And the infection in his brain

549
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:35,925
might mean that he has trouble
with his thinking

550
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,963
or walking.

551
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,630
I'm so sorry.

552
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:43,799
Because of a...

553
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:47,402
a-a bandage he-he wouldn't remove?

554
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,239
I'm afraid so.

00:22:58,017 --> 00:23:01,115
He's a brilliant man.

557
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,452
I fell in love with his mind.

558
00:23:03,457 --> 00:23:06,854
I-I'd never met anyone with
a better bookshelf than mine.

561
00:23:11,964 --> 00:23:15,429
or think...

562
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:17,297
is that living?

563
00:23:17,302 --> 00:23:19,834
Those are all possible consequences,

564
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,438
not guaranteed.

565
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:26,374
But without the surgery he will die.

566
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:28,542
Is he awake?

567
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:31,044
- Can I talk to him?
- No.

568
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:33,216
He's sedated and intubated.

What can I do to help you
make this decision?

Get him an oxygen mask. He's hypoxic.

And I'll keep him from
pulling out his dialysis line.

We're just trying
to keep Marko from dying.

581
00:24:20,564 --> 00:24:23,295
His labs came back.
Lactate is coming down.

582
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,131
So, dialysis is clearing the metformin.

583
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:26,698
But now he can't breathe

584
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:28,501
and he's febrile. Temp 103.

585
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:30,336
Which means the metformin toxicity

586
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:32,070
was actually masking another problem.

587
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:34,031
And we don't know the extent
of what he was taking.

588

There could be any number of

We have to look through it.

593
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:46,054
The answer's got to be in there.

594

She needed a little time.

(WATER RUNNING)

641
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:20,216
Hey.

642
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,817
Getting into anything good?

643
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:25,021
Uh, an esophageal reconstruction.

644
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:27,523
It's interesting, complex,

645
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:30,726
but not good, not by any stretch
of the imagination.

646
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:31,960
You?

647
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,996
Just a lap chole.

648
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:36,197
Wish I could stay and watch.

649
00:27:36,202 --> 00:27:38,533
- (WATER TURNS OFF)
- Hey, Devi.

650
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:41,336
Listen, uh, you talked to your sister?

651
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:43,639
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

652
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:45,773
I was gonna drop by this afternoon

653
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:47,809
to see if she needed any help, but

654
00:27:47,814 --> 00:27:49,677
I got this case, and I won't be

655
00:27:49,682 --> 00:27:52,280
- done till late.
- I was gonna surprise her after lunch,

656
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:53,715
but... (SIGHS)

657
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,984
I don't want her to think
I don't trust her, you know?

658
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:57,485
Yeah. I mean, she's got to learn

659
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,154
to fly solo at some point, right?

660
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,690
She wanted this. She chose it.

661
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:05,027
But did she understand
what she was choosing?

662
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:07,928
- You're worried?
- Maybe.

663
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:11,231
A little, but hopeful.

664
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:12,933
Look, I talked to her,

665
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:15,502
and she was upbeat,

666
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:17,805
- on top of it.
- You sure?

667
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,206
Yes.

668
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:23,044
Great. You know her better than anyone.

669
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:24,378
(SIGHS) All right.

670
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,116
See you.

671
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,492
Send off another blood gas, okay?

672
00:28:38,497 --> 00:28:39,559
Mm-hmm.

673
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:41,595
Has he gotten all the
antibiotics we ordered?

674
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,064
The cefepime is going in.
The vanco just finished.

675
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:46,833
Any other ideas?

676
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:48,372
Not yet.

677
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,203
Marko's sats are worsening.

678
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,607
Chest images show diffuse ground glass.

679
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:57,015
- I want to bronch him, but...
- He'd have to get intubated.

680
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,117
Please tell me you found
a potential culprit med.

681
00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:02,954
But first, tell me, why
did you stick around?

682
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,856
I'm afraid of death.

683
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:06,157
You?

684
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,893
Seriously?

685
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:09,761
You see it all the time.

686
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:11,897
Every day, somebody dies in our ER.

687
00:29:11,902 --> 00:29:14,164
And when it happens, I walk away.

688
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,334
Another team comes in, cleans
the body, zips up the bag.

689
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,902
One moment, a person is there,

690
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:20,838
and the next, there's just...

691
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,106
dead flesh.

692
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,375
Empty eyes. Heavy limbs.

693
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,809
Absence.

694
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:28,013
When I almost lost Jessica,
that's when it got personal.

695
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,414
I realized it will happen to us.

696
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,216
Could happen at any time.

697
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:32,917
And it scares the hell out of me.

698
00:29:32,922 --> 00:29:34,753
Dying.

699
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:36,355
Jessica dying.

700
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,255
My parents or our family cat dying.

701
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,758
It's inevitable.

702
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:45,631
Irrational, but there it is.

703
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:47,964
So, you don't think this guy is nuts?

704
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:49,132
Oh, obviously.

705
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:50,467
He's discounted the fact

706
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:52,168
that a piano could fall on his head.

707
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:54,404
Accidents can happen, even if you stop

708
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:56,074
- the ticking clock.
- But stopping the clock...

709
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:58,608
- Slowing it down...
- ... is appealing, I get it.

710
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:01,311
And reading these papers,
I've learned a few things.

711
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:03,814
Who knew Dairy Queen
could help you live forever?

712
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:07,083
- Hmm?
- Okay, now you lost me.

713
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:08,385
DQ.

714
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,887
It's all over the notes
for his protocols.

715
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,388
DQ isn't Dairy Queen.
It's a combination of two meds

716
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:14,857
that help your body
get rid of old cells.

717
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:16,792
I want to get rid of
my old cells. What's in it?

718
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:18,297
Well...

719
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:21,029
It looks like the Q is quercetin,

720
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:22,898
another antioxidant found in plants.

721
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:24,769
All right, cross that
one off, and the D?

722
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:28,536
Dasatinib, that's chemo.

723
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,672
Marko's been taking chemo? He is nuts.

724
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:32,675
But wait, if he's taking dasatinib,

725
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:34,442
then he has a compromised immune system.

726
00:30:34,447 --> 00:30:37,713
And we have a whole new differential.

727
00:30:37,718 --> 00:30:38,981
Marko.

728
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:41,117
- Hey, Marko.
- (GROANS)

729
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:43,052
Do you take the chemo drug dasatinib?

730
00:30:43,056 --> 00:30:46,057
Yeah, yeah, I take it every day.

731
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,571

Spinal rod visualized.

733
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,355
Damage is extensive.

734
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,291
Manipulation could cause injury
to the spinal cord.

735
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,226
That's why you two are here, Kit.

736
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,428
Hold retraction steady.

737
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,766
I'll begin working on the hardware.

(DOOR OPENS)

739
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,345
It was finally quiet in the unit.

740
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:28,247
I wanted to see how you
were doing with all of this.

741
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:31,717
Raja was my biggest win of intern year.

742
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:34,286
We saved his life. Now...

743
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:36,122
he'll never be the same again,

744
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,361
if he even gets out of this OR.

745
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:42,828
And it was all avoidable.

746
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:45,664
I can't pretend to know
what was going on in his head,

747
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:48,367
but... I can imagine.

748
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:50,439
Tell me.

749
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,273
The cancer was a trauma.

750
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:56,175
He wanted to leave it behind,

751
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,444
believe he was all better.

752
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:02,047
Couldn't tolerate knowing if he wasn't.

753
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:04,585
Okay, yeah, but...

754
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,287
... look at the consequences.

755
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:12,723
I looked away many times with my dad.

756
00:32:12,728 --> 00:32:16,361
For years, there were signs
that something was wrong,

757
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:18,996
that he was altered,

758
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:20,331
but I'd excuse it.

759
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:22,434
I'd say it was pressure

760
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:25,403
or stress or fatigue.

761
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:28,139
But then, I realized,

762
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:31,242
the next time I looked away,

763
00:32:31,247 --> 00:32:34,115
he could OD and die.

764
00:32:35,185 --> 00:32:37,182
So, you started
watching him like a hawk.

765
00:32:37,187 --> 00:32:38,349
Yeah.

766
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:41,418
But this last time, I was wrong.

767
00:32:41,423 --> 00:32:44,221
He wasn't using,
the drug test proved it.

768
00:32:44,226 --> 00:32:46,190
And I... (SIGHS) I overreacted.

769
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:49,460
It happens to everyone
who loves an addict.

770
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:53,130
Nic had the same issue
with her sister, her father.

771
00:32:53,135 --> 00:32:56,200
She spent her whole life
trying to save them.

772
00:32:56,205 --> 00:32:59,637
In Al-Anon, they say let go.

773
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:02,173
Let them take the consequences.

774
00:33:02,178 --> 00:33:03,708
Mm-hmm.

775
00:33:03,713 --> 00:33:06,811
But, sometimes, those
consequences are death.

776
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,546
How can a family
not try to prevent that?

777
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:12,783
I think that whatever happens with Ian,

778
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:15,319
it is out of your control.

779
00:33:15,324 --> 00:33:17,190
He's a grown man.

780
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,291
Maybe the same thing is true with Raja.

781
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:24,394
Once he left the hospital,

782
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,666
it was out of your control.

783
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,770
You did everything you could, Conrad.

804
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,663
to clear dead cells,

805
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:36,099

not to threaten it. (CHUCKLES)

- It was a perfect storm.
- DEVON: Your strict diet

807
00:34:37,938 --> 00:34:39,902
and exercise left you dehydrated,

808
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:42,205
which allowed
for the metformin to build up

809
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,007
- in your bloodstream.
- That damaged your kidneys

810
00:34:44,011 --> 00:34:46,374
and caused the lactic
acidosis, and that's

811
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,344
what made you so short of breath
when doing push-ups.

812
00:34:48,348 --> 00:34:49,945
And once your kidneys were injured,

813
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,147
they couldn't metabolize
the chemo fast enough,

814
00:34:52,152 --> 00:34:54,582
so it accumulated, and you
couldn't fight infection.

815
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:56,484

you should be okay.

820
