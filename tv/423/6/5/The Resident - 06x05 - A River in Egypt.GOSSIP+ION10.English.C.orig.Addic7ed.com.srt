1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,430
Previously on The Resident...

2
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,525
MS is such a bastard.

3
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,170
You think you're on a plateau,
and then it just crumbles.

4
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:26,005
Things are developing all the time, Kit.

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,440
But it's always there,
hanging over our heads.

6
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,275
This hospital-wide drug test.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,778
- Did you name my father?
- Of course not.

8
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,533
Would Nic approve of me with Cade?

9
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:36,769
I just want you to be happy,
so would Nic.

10
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:39,338
The twins look perfect.
Healthy weight, strong heartbeat.

11
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:41,207
I'd say this family can
go home this afternoon.

12
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:43,209
Ah, you hear that, Padma? We're finally

13
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:44,811
breaking you guys out of here.

14
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:47,216
That is music to my ears.

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,625
CT is backed up. I'll call over.

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,061
One cranberry juice coming up.

17
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:59,930
And your discharge papers.

18
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,503
Looks like we can send you home
with a prednisone burst.

19
00:01:05,374 --> 00:01:07,070
No rest for the weary.

20
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:10,107
No rest, little reward, and yet
I keep coming back for more.

21
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:14,278
What do you have for us?

22
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,014
Raja El Khoury. 38-year-old male,

23
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,077
episode of emesis. Students called EMS.

24
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:19,782
Sats were low, tachy to 120s.

25
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:20,884
Let's get him to Bay Eight.

26
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:22,822
He's improving with oxygen
but still kind of out of it.

27
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:23,826
What are you doing?

28
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:25,031
Raja, is it?

29
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,200
Okay, you're in the ER at Chastain.

30
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:29,225
I'm Dr. Feldman, this is Nurse Hundley.

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,429
- We're gonna take care of you.
- I don't care who you are.

32
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,562
I want out of here.

33
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,801
- Just let me get up!
- Okay.

34
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:38,268
Let's get him on a monitor
and a 12-lead EKG.

35
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:40,270
- I'm on it.
- None of the rest of you

36
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:42,639
touch me. He's the only doctor I'll see.

37
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,541
Seriously? Who are you talking about?

38
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:46,208
Dr. Hawkins.

39
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:51,447
He saved my life.

40
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,453
How old do you think I am?

41
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,967
- Wager a guess.
- I'm sorry,

42
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:00,522
are you my 8:00 a.m. meeting about

43
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:01,928
- a research possibility... ?
- Sorry, yes.

44
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:04,159
I'm Marko Zytylny. So, come on,

45
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:05,560
how old?

46
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:07,596
All right, all right, all right.
No need to guess.

47
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:09,398
See this?

48
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:11,534
My genetic age,
according to this, is 50.

49
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,236
But my real age, in real life,

50
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,538
72.

51
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:16,772
Yup.

52
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:18,607
That's impressive, Mr. Zytylny.

53
00:02:18,612 --> 00:02:21,077
No, please, call me Marko.

54
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:22,644
Since I was a child,

55
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:24,380
I believed that aging,

56
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:26,682
infirmity, and death were inevitable,

57
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,484
but that's a fallacy.

58
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,887
Hmm. You see, here at Chastain,

59
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:34,255
you guys are playing a very expensive

60
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,691
game of Whac-A-Mole.

61
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:38,727
The patients come to you with,
uh, heart disease in their 50s.

62
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:41,630
Whack. In their 70s, with cancer. Whack.

63
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:44,099
In their 80s, with Alzheimer's...

64
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:46,934
Try to whack it, you can't. They die.

65
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,637
But not

66
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:51,707
if you fix aging.

67
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:53,609
You get rid of all of that.

68
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:56,377
- You see, that's my dream.
- Okay.

69
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:58,146
I am intrigued,

70
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:00,816
- but how can I help you?
- Dr. Pravesh, I-I've

71
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:04,152
read your work, and
you think outside the box.

72
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:05,286
I really believe...

73
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,823
What is the scientific question

74
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:09,457
that you want me to answer?

75
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:11,496
Isn't that obvious?

76
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:16,798
How to live forever.

00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:43,757
And I want to thank you

79
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:45,459
for only doing pee-pee

80
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,394
while Daddy changes you.

81
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:50,531
Hey, Padma, I got to get going, okay?

82
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,068
He's probably tired

83
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:56,403
or hungry

84
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:58,972
or gassy or he pooped again.

85
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:01,207
Or maybe he just needs

86
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:03,143
a little of this.

87
00:04:03,148 --> 00:04:05,178
♪ Twinkle, twinkle ♪

88
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,514
♪ Twinkle, twinkle. ♪

89
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:12,585
All right, now, you be a good

90
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,921
little boy for your mama, all right?

91
00:04:14,926 --> 00:04:17,290
And, Padma, if all else fails, remember

92
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:20,326
you have these womb-inspired
sounds and motions

93
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,696
to remind them of the good old days.

94
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:24,497
Paddie, I'm gonna get going, all right?

95
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:26,566
But you haven't had any coffee yet.

96
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:27,901
Do you want to wait ten minutes?

97
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:30,136
I'm sorry, I wish I could, but I can't.

98
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:32,471
Look, I'll try to swing by
between surgeries, okay?

99
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:34,240
- It's okay. I got this.
- Yes, you do.

100
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,909
Look, you are an amazing mom already.

101
00:04:36,914 --> 00:04:40,046
Just remember, Padma,
if you need anything...

102
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:41,947
I know. I'll call. Okay.

103

If I go in the next couple of minutes,

107
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,463
I might be able to finish my lecture.

108
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:00,799
I have spent way too much
of my life in this place

109
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:03,402
with doctors drawing my blood.

110
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:05,571
No offense.

111
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:08,807
None taken.

112
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:12,144
I took care of Raja when he was
diagnosed with bone cancer.

113
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,613
Diagnosis you made.

114
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:15,248
All the other doctors said

115
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:16,749
shin splints.

116
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:19,251
You were sweating bullets
when you told me.

117
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:20,953
I was an intern.

118
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,488
I never told someone
they had advanced cancer.

119
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:25,824
Oh, that takes me back to a time

120
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,559
I never want to revisit.

121
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:29,662
Managed to stay away from
this building for the last

122
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,430
eight years, till today.

123
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:33,499
So, what happened?

124
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,533
Well, I was giving my favorite lecture

125
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:37,202
on Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

126
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:38,503
when I threw up.

127
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:41,473
Then I couldn't catch my breath.

128
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:43,275
My students called 911.

129
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,510
It's good they did.

130
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,511
It actually looks like
you have a bad pneumonia.

131
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:48,147
You might have aspirated from the vomit,

132
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:51,082
or you could have a virus
that explains both symptoms.

133
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,352
So, that's all that's wrong?

134
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:55,553
- As far as we can tell right now.
- So,

135
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:57,022
maybe I wait here a few more hours

136
00:05:57,027 --> 00:05:58,857
and, uh, I call my fiancée,

137
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:00,859
- and she takes me home.
- Whoa, hold your horses.

138
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:03,060
We need to get you on IV antibiotics,

139
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,396
keep you on oxygen,
and get you to the ICU.

140
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,231
Home will have to wait.

141
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:09,700
Just get me better.

142
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,602
You did it once,

143
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:14,772
you do it again, okay?

144
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:16,177
That's the plan.

145
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:21,345
You know, that's the one
drawback of being an ER doc.

146
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,148
- There's just one?
- One of many. No one

147
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:26,183
credits me with saving
their life, though I do

148
00:06:26,188 --> 00:06:28,488
all the time, but I send them off,

149
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:30,657
and they fawn over their internists

150
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:31,989
who take care of them upstairs.

151
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:34,558
Do I detect some envy, Dr. Feldman?

152
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:36,194
It's just frustrating.

153
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,829
Yeah, they get to know you.
You see them day after day.

154
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,866
Why not add another specialty?
Irving Feldman,

155
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:44,035
Doctor of Medicine.

156
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,369
No, thank you. I did my internship.

157
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,505
I remember those interminable rounds,

158
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,374
discussing hyponatremia.

159
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,075
Hey, you don't know what you're missing.

160
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,812
You might actually like
hanging out with the patients.

161
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:55,313
Can't a man complain
around here without you

162
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:57,380
always trying to offer
a solution, Hawkins?

163
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:59,683
When my shift ends in two hours,

164
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:01,352
I am out

165
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:02,753
of here. Done.

166
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:05,589
Gone. Buh-bye.

167
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,158
Buh-bye.

168
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:09,259
And after my daily push-ups,

169
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:11,595
I do a quick five-minute
liquid nitrogen bath.

170
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,196
You ever had one?

171
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:15,732
- Uh, I can't say that I have.
- I highly recommend it.

172
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:18,502
Soothes the muscles,
reduces inflammation,

173
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:19,870
lifts the mood.

174
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,295
Damn, I think I've lost count.

175
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,040
Remarkably, you're at 90.

176
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,577
And my protocols work, Dr. Pravesh.

177
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:29,344
Just help me study my tests,

178
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,713
then we could all maybe

179
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:34,350
live forever. 99... 100.

180
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:38,654
I'm telling you

181
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,790
that death is a scientific problem

182
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,191
we can solve together.

183
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,593
Trust me.

184
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,995
This about does it for our tour
of the hospital today.

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,229
I am afraid I'm gonna have to

186
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,665
wrap it up. I have a full day, so...

187
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,966
- On one condition.
- What's that?

188
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,570
We round this out
with one set of stairs.

189
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,573
Mr. Zytylny...

190
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:58,408
Let's go! Whoo!

191
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,379
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

192
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,348
- I can't, I can't breathe.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

193
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,019
Can I get some help over here?

194
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:15,055
Reading something good?

195
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,989
Uh, just an email

196
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:18,294
Ian forwarded me

197
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,996
from a mom thanking him
for saving her baby.

198
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,998
Modest as always.

199
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,071
- Sounds like the Ian we know.
- Hmm.

200
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:27,836
How is everything with him, in general?

201
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,105
Passed his drug test.

202
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,475
Operating up a storm, so...

203
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,876
fine, I guess.

204
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,415
That's a relief.

205
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,614
So is the fact that

206
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,221
I am finally off nights.

207
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,823
As much as I love
my solo dinners with Gigi...

208
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,830
You have room for one more tonight?

209
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,262
Always.

210
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,131
Dr. Hawkins, we need you
in Raja's room now.

211
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:03,304
Raja, you're okay. You're
safe. What's going on?

212
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,273
Good, better, best, bested.

213
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,808
He was answering my questions,

214
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,543
and then he stopped making sense.

215
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,845
We need to get his fever down.
One gram of acetaminophen.

216
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,214
Grab a liter of Lactated Ringer's.

217
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,149
Sats are dropping.
I'm going up on his O2.

218
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,951
Dance like the wind.

219
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,454
- This is more than just pneumonia.
- He's too altered.

220
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,221
I'm worried about meningitis.

221
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,657
- It hurts! Stop!
- Photophobia.

222
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,391
Let's check for nuchal rigidity.

223
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:25,828
We're just gonna move
your head a little bit.

224
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,029
Get off me!

225
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,430
- His neck is stiff.
- Raja, what's this?

226
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:33,200
No, bandage. Don't-don't touch it.

227
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,168
- Is that...
- Looks like spinal hardware.

228
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,104
From the surgery for spinal mets.

229
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,972
- But you said his cancer was...
- Eight years ago.

230
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,907
Raja, that rod sticking out
of your neck...

231
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:44,011
how long has that been there?
Yeah, I need two milligrams

232
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:46,679
of IV lorazepam and get me
an intubation kit now.

233
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,615
Tell CT to get ready.

234
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,653
Coming in for a head scan.

235
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,680
You know, I'm still game
to go back to your office.

236
00:09:56,685 --> 00:10:00,010
This is no place to discuss
data. It's pretty loud,

237
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,465
and, well, it's full of sick people.

238
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,433
We're not talking data now.

239
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,302
You nearly passed out, so Dr. Feldman

240
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:07,470
and I are gonna find out why.

241
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:08,572
I'm sure Dr. Feldman

242
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:09,817
has a lot better things to do.

243
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:11,876
Marko, you said you wanted me
to study you, right?

244
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,577
- Let me study you.
- Looks like your EKG is normal.

245
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:16,013
We're waiting on some lab results,

246
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:17,614
and we'll see what they tell us.

247
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:19,916
- Okay.
- All right. Back in a sec.

248
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,785
Thank you.

249
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,720
No way that man is 70.

250
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:25,354
He has an anti-aging regimen

251
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,224
he thinks is the path to eternal life.

252
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:30,493
So, what's his secret?

253
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:32,195
Well...

254
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,964
- knock yourself out.
- Whoa.

255
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:37,499
You know, it's being studied
all over Silicon Valley.

256
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,335
Every tech entrepreneur
wants to figure out

257
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,337
how to live forever,
and I cannot blame them.

258
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:43,605
I think he collapsed on our stairway

259
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,142
while claiming to have
the answer to eternal life.

260
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:48,110
He needs to face the truth.

261
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:51,080
We all age. We all die.
We can't stop it.

262
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:52,381
But we can try.

263
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,250
I'll see about those labs. You enjoy.

264
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:56,288
Yeah, thanks.

265
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,062
I would love to hold you both,

266
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,964
but that is physically impossible.

267
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:09,731
You get that, right, guys?

268
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,110
Okay, please just go
to sleep. You'll feel better.

269
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,555
Hey. Just checking in.

270
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,957
- How are the little fellas doing?
- Oh, um...

271
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,259
Good. Yeah, they're-they're
falling asleep now.

272
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,761
Ah, they like those bassinets,

273
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,930
don't they? I knew that
was a good purchase.

274
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,198
Yeah. Loving them.

275
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,932
Um, listen, I got to go.

276
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,367
Diapers need changing.

277
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,402
But thanks for checking in. Okay, bye.

278
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,387
Wait, I don't understand.

279
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,223
He has hardware sticking out of his neck

280
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,758
and did nothing to get it fixed?

281
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,693
He didn't even mention it
when he was awake,

282
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,195
and now that he's intubated,
I can't ask him about it.

283
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,498
It's not just you he didn't tell.

284
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,903
Looks like he stopped showing up
to his follow-up scans

285
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,535
and appointments five years ago.

286
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,172
They left message after message.

287
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,673
He never even called them back.

288
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:28,708
We've all seen cases like this.

289
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:31,044
The patient who ignores
their breast cancer

290
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:32,812
till it starts bleeding
through their skin.

291
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:35,349
Mm-hmm. I took care of a man
with squamous cell cancer

292
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,618
on his scalp that he hid
under a hat for years.

293
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,386
When I first told Raja he had cancer,

294
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,392
he wanted to do everything
he could to stay positive.

295
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,659
He didn't want to know his odds.
Nothing negative.

296
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:44,894
And it worked.

297
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,294
His cancer was cured.

298
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,562
It's complicated.

299
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,431
Sometimes you need a

300
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,502
dose of denial to have hope.

301
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:03,543
This is even worse than I thought.

302
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:05,111
See the debris in the ventricles?

303
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:07,747
Ventriculitis. No wonder he seized.

304
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,550
Bacteria must have tracked
from his skin,

305
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:10,650
via the rod, to his brain.

306
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,187
You'll need to make sure his antibiotics

307
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,492
- cross the blood-brain barrier.
- We'll take him to the OR

308
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:17,691
to remove the rod, or
antibiotics won't be enough.

309
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,993
Damn it, I already see signs
of hydrocephalus.

310
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:22,528
I'll have to intervene
on that before anything else.

311
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,629
That's what will kill him.

312
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:25,198
So we get him back to the ICU.

313
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:26,232
And I'll place an EVD

314
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:28,334
in his ventricles at the bedside
to help drain the pus

315
00:13:28,338 --> 00:13:30,868
and relieve the brain swelling.
If that's not enough,

316
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:32,538
then I'll have to take him
to the OR for an open

317
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:33,872
craniotomy and a washout.

318
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:36,378
I told Raja I'd get him out of this.

319
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:43,582
That he'd be okay.

320
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:45,787
I'll do everything I can.

321
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,458
Marko, what's going on?

322
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:55,728
Something's not right.

323
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,630
I can't catch my breath.

324
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,764
My body hurts all over. Ooh...

325
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:02,100
- His lungs are clear.
- And his sats are fine.

326
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:04,168
He's just breathing
40 times a minute. Marko,

327
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:07,239
- try to take long, slow breaths.
- Okay.

328
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:09,307
Let's get a blood gas.

329
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,211
Hold on. His labs just came in.
This explains it.

330
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:14,946
His lactic acid is sky-high.

331
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:20,952
- Ischemic bowel or a perf?
- Unlikely.

332
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:22,621
His belly exam is soft,

333
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:24,021
but his blood pressure is stable.

334
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:26,524
Infection then,
or alcoholic ketoacidosis.

335
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:27,926
Alcohol?

336
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:30,528
And degrade my body's ability
to fight off infection?

337
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,230
Ruin my liver? I do not drink alcohol.

338
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:35,899
Okay, so no alcohol, but
let's get more fluids running.

339
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:38,535
Pan-culture, start
broad-spectrum antibiotics

340
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,072
- to be safe.
- And a tox screen. It could be

341
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:41,638
- an ingestion.
- Hmm.

342
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:46,042
Marko, are you a diabetic?

343
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:49,079
Alcohol, diabetes.
Are you guys insulting me?

344
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:52,048
Sorry, but are you on the
diabetes medication metformin?

345
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:55,553
Well, of course, and
you guys should be, too.

346
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:57,220
That stuff is a miracle drug.

347
00:14:57,225 --> 00:14:59,923
That miracle drug could be
what's making you so sick.

348
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:02,959
Metformin can cause a dangerous
build-up of lactic acid.

349
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:06,099
You guys can fix it, right?

350
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:09,099
We should be able to, but
we're gonna have to admit you

351
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:11,103
to the ICU and start you on dialysis.

352
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:19,175
Hey. Your shift's over, right?

353
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,560
Any plans for the day?

354
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:22,545
Once Jessica's done, definitely.

355
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,414
Till then, waiting for her,

356
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:26,816
charting, searching
the call room for bedbugs.

357
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:28,884
Sounds like a blast.
Well, if you get bored,

358
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:32,654
you're welcome to join me and
our very mortal patient instead.

359
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:33,989
Interesting. I would,

360
00:15:33,994 --> 00:15:36,391
but I've already promised
Jessica I'd go rock climbing.

361
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:37,694
All right, see you.

362
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:39,362
All right, bye.

363
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:42,567
Won't know how bad this ventriculitis is

364
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:43,572
until I'm in there.

365
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,807
I remember the last time
I saw Raja here.

366
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,369
Nic took care of him.

367
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:50,104
Threw him a birthday party.

368
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:52,708
I remember her talking about that.

369
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:54,947
Threading the catheter.

370
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:00,585
Conrad...

371
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:04,920
I'll have to put another drain
in the left frontal horn.

372
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:07,256
He is gonna be a lucky man
if he gets out of this

373
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:09,024
without any major neurologic deficits.

374
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,492
If he just would've told anyone.

375
00:16:10,497 --> 00:16:13,062
Maybe he was afraid it was the
cancer, and he couldn't face it.

376
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:14,767
It seems crazy.

377
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:18,165
But we all cover up things
we don't want to see.

378
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,034
The longer we look away,

379
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,640
the harder it gets to see
what's right before our eyes.

380
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:26,843
What is on your mind?

381
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,678
Uh, I can't say I'm unfamiliar

382
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,513
with denial.

383
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:35,018
None of us are.

384
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:40,456
What have you denied?

385
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,624
Fair amount.

386
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,193
First drain is in.

387
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,731
Looks like a massive upper GI bleed.

388
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:54,768
We'll need central access.
We need norepinephrine,

389
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:56,870
- and call the blood bank!
- Why is this happening?

390
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,171
Ventriculitis shouldn't cause
a GI hemorrhage.

391
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:00,676
No, it shouldn't.

392
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:05,077
- Unless...
- What are you thinking?

393
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:06,778
Rod tore through the skin.

394
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:09,081
The infection ate away
at the bones in his c-spine

395
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:10,417
and allowed the rod to come loose.

396
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,620
Could cause any amount of damage
to his muscle, vessels...

397
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:14,264
It could've pushed
through his esophagus,

398
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:15,799
causing him to bleed.

399
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:18,385
Which could kill him even faster
than any brain infection.

400
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,340
And then he developed a huge GI bleed,

401
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,175
so we did an upper endoscopy
in the ICU. Take a look.

402
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:32,795
The rod penetrated the man's esophagus?

403
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,631
It did, which explains why
he vomited initially.

404
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:38,234
The more we unearth, the more
devastating this becomes.

405
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,569
Question is,

406
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:42,572
can you operate and save him?

407
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:45,742
You realize what that surgery

408
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:47,644
would entail, right?

409
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,679
Man, I'd have to open his neck,

410
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:53,015
reconstruct his esophagus
with a muscle flap from his pec.

411
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,984
That's if I can remove the rod.

412
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:56,186
As far as the spine...

413
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,054
Billie will take that one with Voss.

414
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,121
It's a Hail Mary, man,
but this is what we do,

415
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,858
isn't it? We take on surgeries
that can't be done,

416
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:04,960
then convince ourselves
we can accomplish

417
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:07,095
the impossible.

418
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,965
All right, clearly he can't
give consent himself.

419
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,734
Now, you know him, do you think
he would even agree

420
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:14,069
to a surgery this dangerous?

421
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:15,939
I thought I knew him,
but I don't know this guy

422
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:18,640
who put a Band-Aid over a rod
sticking out of his neck.

423
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:20,508
- Any family on the way?
- Yeah.

424
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:23,144
Fiancée. I'll talk to her.

425
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:25,881
All right, if she gives her consent,

426
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:28,583
then tell Billie to book us an OR.

427
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:42,162
Get that air out, little guy.
You'll feel better.

428
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:45,733
You have to 'cause I don't
really have a backup plan here.

429
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:48,102
Come on.

430
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:50,605
Great.

431
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,173
See? Something's working.

432
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:54,642
Now you feel...

433
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:00,047
... like crying.

434
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:02,552
Always crying.

435
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,653
Hey, Padma, did you try to call?

436
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:10,658
Did I?

437
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,426
Baby butt dial. Sorry.

438
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,128
Oh, wait, no, no, since
I have you, how are things?

439
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,396
Aw, I hear the little guys
showing off their lungs.

440
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:18,765
Good, good.

441
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,934
Yeah, they are little show-offs,
aren't they?

442
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:22,969
You know, I was thinking
about you three today

443
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:25,339
in my wellness yoga.
Sara's not as motivating as you,

444
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,840
but it still feels nice.

445
00:19:26,845 --> 00:19:29,208
Yoga? Nice.

446
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:30,276
And you know what?

447
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,612
What?

448
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:34,347
When I was lying in Savasana,

449
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:36,216
I found myself thinking about your dream

450
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:38,217
of being a mother, no matter what.

451
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:39,953
How you didn't let anything stop you.

452
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,922
You wanted it and you made it happen.

453
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:46,159
All thanks to you, Leela. I love you.

454
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:48,731
Now go save lives.

455
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:51,563
Here you go.

456
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:54,066
Thanks.

457
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:56,201
Hi.

458
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:58,270
- Mwah. Hi.
- How was your shift?

459
00:19:58,275 --> 00:19:59,672
The usual.

460
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:01,706
Fighting the entropy
that is our broken system

461
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:03,709
- while trying not to get sued.
- Mm.

462
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:05,277
There was one interesting case,

463
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,512
- and Hundley brought muffins.
- Hmm.

464
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:08,784
Ready to flee?

465
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,183
I have bad news.

466
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:13,318
- No. Why?
- I can't.

467
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:14,552
Nathan called out.

468
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:16,455
- Oh.
- So I have to stay,

469
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,425
but you should still go
rock climbing without me.

470
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,958
- Yeah.
- Which really is a wise move anyway

471
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:22,760
since I primarily stay earthbound

472
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,896
and I just watch you,
praying that you don't fall

473
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:26,698
and shatter every bone in your body.

474
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:29,000
I never fall. I mean, fall-fall.

475
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:31,202
Everyone does eventually.

476
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:35,472
I mean, we're not old,
but we're not young either.

477
00:20:35,477 --> 00:20:38,475
I'm just saying, if you didn't
fall, you wouldn't bounce.

478
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,211
- Ha!
- Just keep in mind

479
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:41,979
the consequences, okay? And be careful.

480
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:44,716
Okay. I think I might just stick around.

481
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:47,218
Really? 'Cause I could be several hours.

482
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:49,253
There's this case I'm curious about.

483
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:51,988
Could shed some light on how
to be able to climb rock walls

484
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:54,828
like a young mountain goat
for years to come.

485
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,596
He told me he wore that bandage to keep

486
00:20:58,601 --> 00:20:59,763
his surgical scar clean.

487
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:02,133
He wore it the entire time
we were together.

488
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:04,835
Two years.

489
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,738
You must think I'm so stupid.

490
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:09,440
No.

491
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:12,576
Raja's got us all thinking about denial.

492
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,945
Mm-hmm. My own fiancé.

493
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,014
I knew how much he hated
talking about hard things.

494
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,684
I asked him once about his cancer

495
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:23,654
and whether he still needed
to see doctors regularly,

496
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:24,722
and he told me no,

497
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:26,423
he was all better.

498
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:28,826
What do I know? I believed him.

499
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:31,828
This isn't your fault.

500
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,597
What matters is what we do next.

501
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:36,866
Raja can't speak for himself anymore,

502
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:40,039
and he designated you to make
his medical decisions.

503
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:43,943
Wow, uh, okay.

504
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,982
- Tell me.
- He's gonna need surgery.

505
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:54,885
The rod that stabilized his spine

506
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,120
pushed through his esophagus, so

507
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,122
our thoracic surgeon will need to work

508
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:01,124
with our spine surgeon to remove it.

509
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,663
And if you're successful, he'll be okay?

510
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:12,769
The surgery's dangerous.

511
00:22:13,574 --> 00:22:16,172
Life-threatening.

512
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:19,009
And if he lives,

513
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:23,045
he will not be the same.

514
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,783
There's a chance he might not
be able to eat again or...

515
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:29,352
talk again

516
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:31,454
or breathe on his own.

517
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:33,422
And the infection in his brain

518
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:35,925
might mean that he has trouble
with his thinking

519
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,963
or walking.

520
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,630
I'm so sorry.

521
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:43,799
Because of a...

522
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:47,402
a-a bandage he-he wouldn't remove?

523
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,239
I'm afraid so.

524
00:22:58,017 --> 00:23:01,115
He's a brilliant man.

525
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,452
I fell in love with his mind.

526
00:23:03,457 --> 00:23:06,854
I-I'd never met anyone with
a better bookshelf than mine.

527
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:10,558
But to not eat

528
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:11,959
or talk

529
00:23:11,964 --> 00:23:15,429
or think...

530
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:17,297
is that living?

531
00:23:17,302 --> 00:23:19,834
Those are all possible consequences,

532
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,438
not guaranteed.

533
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:26,374
But without the surgery he will die.

534
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:28,542
Is he awake?

535
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:31,044
- Can I talk to him?
- No.

536
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:33,216
He's sedated and intubated.

537
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,521
What can I do to help you
make this decision?

538
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:41,223
I'd like to see him.

539
00:23:46,998 --> 00:23:50,296
Pravesh, your immortal
patient's in trouble.

540
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,301
Get over here.

541
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:55,902
I need resveratrol.

542
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:58,170
I have the telomeres of a 50-year-old.

543
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,443
Get him an oxygen mask. He's hypoxic.

544
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:04,414
And I'll keep him from
pulling out his dialysis line.

545
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:15,220
- You still here?
- I just can't quit you.

546
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:18,490
Jessica's in another surgery,
and I want to live forever.

547
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:20,559
We're just trying
to keep Marko from dying.

548
00:24:20,564 --> 00:24:23,295
His labs came back.
Lactate is coming down.

549
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,131
So, dialysis is clearing the metformin.

550
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:26,698
But now he can't breathe

551
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:28,501
and he's febrile. Temp 103.

552
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:30,336
Which means the metformin toxicity

553
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:32,070
was actually masking another problem.

554
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:34,031
And we don't know the extent
of what he was taking.

555
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:37,235
There could be any number of
drug-drug interactions with this man.

556
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:40,646
Wait.

557
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:41,980
The briefcase full of papers

558
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:43,315
that he keeps talking about.

559
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,416
We have to look through it.

560
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:46,054
The answer's got to be in there.

561
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,164
Tell me.

562
00:24:58,169 --> 00:24:59,999
Are we headed to the OR?

563
00:25:00,004 --> 00:25:02,930
Abigail's deciding.
She needed a little time.

564
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,165
She's reeling. Raja wore that bandage

565
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,034
for at least two years,
their entire relationship,

566
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,434
and she never looked under it.

567
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,370
I can't imagine being in her position.

568
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,008
Makes me want to ask
everybody everything...

569
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:18,180
... even if I'm afraid of the answer.

570
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,684
Me, too.

571
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:27,472
Please do the surgery.

572
00:25:27,477 --> 00:25:30,341
I know the odds are long, but we'll take

573
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:32,076
whatever chance.

574
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:35,213
I think that's the choice
Raja would make.

575
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:38,483
Just do your best for him, okay?

576
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:40,722
Of course.

577
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,497
Ms. Devi? Ms. Devi?

578
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:55,068
Are you still there?

579
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:58,669
Wow, I, um,

580
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:01,805
I forgot I was on hold.
Dr. Petrosian, sorry to bother.

581
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,342
I just... I had one question
about the babies.

582
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:08,012
Of course. Go ahead.

583
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:11,015
Things were okay at first, but...

584
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,051
they won't stop crying, and I mean...

585
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:16,520
all day long.

586
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:18,022
Something must be wrong.

587
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:19,823
Babies cry, Padma.

588
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,224
No, but...

589
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:23,727
sometimes I think that
they're gonna pass out

590
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:26,154
because they're crying so hard
that they're not breathing.

591
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,598
They won't pass out, and if
they do, they'll breathe again.

592
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:31,666
Just hold them as much as you can.

593
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:33,636
Lots of skin-to-skin contact.

594
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,639
There's two of them.

595
00:26:36,644 --> 00:26:38,207
I can't...

596
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:40,879
I can't hold them both
all day long when they scream.

597
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:45,815
This is hard, do you understand?

598
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,652
I do. Moms worry, that's normal.

599
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:53,189
And crying for babies is also normal.

600
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,523
Are you sure I shouldn't

601
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,358
just bring them in for a little while?

602
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:59,694
No need. Now, do you
want me to transfer you

603
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:02,968
to our receptionist, confirm
your next appointment?

604
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:20,216
Hey.

605
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,817
Getting into anything good?

606
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:25,021
Uh, an esophageal reconstruction.

607
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:27,523
It's interesting, complex,

608
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:30,726
but not good, not by any stretch
of the imagination.

609
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:31,960
You?

610
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,996
Just a lap chole.

611
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:36,197
Wish I could stay and watch.

612
00:27:36,202 --> 00:27:38,533
Hey, Devi.

613
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:41,336
Listen, uh, you talked to your sister?

614
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:43,639
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

615
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:45,773
I was gonna drop by this afternoon

616
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:47,809
to see if she needed any help, but

617
00:27:47,814 --> 00:27:49,677
I got this case, and I won't be

618
00:27:49,682 --> 00:27:52,280
- done till late.
- I was gonna surprise her after lunch,

619
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:53,715
but...

620
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,984
I don't want her to think
I don't trust her, you know?

621
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:57,485
Yeah. I mean, she's got to learn

622
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,154
to fly solo at some point, right?

623
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,690
She wanted this. She chose it.

624
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:05,027
But did she understand
what she was choosing?

625
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:07,928
- You're worried?
- Maybe.

626
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:11,231
A little, but hopeful.

627
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:12,933
Look, I talked to her,

628
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:15,502
and she was upbeat,

629
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:17,805
- on top of it.
- You sure?

630
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,206
Yes.

631
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:23,044
Great. You know her better than anyone.

632
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:24,378
All right.

633
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,116
See you.

634
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,492
Send off another blood gas, okay?

635
00:28:38,497 --> 00:28:39,559
Mm-hmm.

636
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:41,595
Has he gotten all the
antibiotics we ordered?

637
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,064
The cefepime is going in.
The vanco just finished.

638
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:46,833
Any other ideas?

639
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:48,372
Not yet.

640
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,203
Marko's sats are worsening.

641
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,607
Chest images show diffuse ground glass.

642
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:57,015
- I want to bronch him, but...
- He'd have to get intubated.

643
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,117
Please tell me you found
a potential culprit med.

644
00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:02,954
But first, tell me, why
did you stick around?

645
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,856
I'm afraid of death.

646
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:06,157
You?

647
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,893
Seriously?

648
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:09,761
You see it all the time.

649
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:11,897
Every day, somebody dies in our ER.

650
00:29:11,902 --> 00:29:14,164
And when it happens, I walk away.

651
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,334
Another team comes in, cleans
the body, zips up the bag.

652
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,902
One moment, a person is there,

653
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:20,838
and the next, there's just...

654
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,106
dead flesh.

655
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,375
Empty eyes. Heavy limbs.

656
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,809
Absence.

657
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:28,013
When I almost lost Jessica,
that's when it got personal.

658
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,414
I realized it will happen to us.

659
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,216
Could happen at any time.

660
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:32,917
And it scares the hell out of me.

661
00:29:32,922 --> 00:29:34,753
Dying.

662
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:36,355
Jessica dying.

663
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,255
My parents or our family cat dying.

664
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,758
It's inevitable.

665
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:45,631
Irrational, but there it is.

666
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:47,964
So, you don't think this guy is nuts?

667
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:49,132
Oh, obviously.

668
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:50,467
He's discounted the fact

669
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:52,168
that a piano could fall on his head.

670
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:54,404
Accidents can happen, even if you stop

671
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:56,074
- the ticking clock.
- But stopping the clock...

672
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:58,608
- Slowing it down...
- ... is appealing, I get it.

673
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:01,311
And reading these papers,
I've learned a few things.

674
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:03,814
Who knew Dairy Queen
could help you live forever?

675
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:07,083
- Hmm?
- Okay, now you lost me.

676
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:08,385
DQ.

677
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,887
It's all over the notes
for his protocols.

678
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,388
DQ isn't Dairy Queen.
It's a combination of two meds

679
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:14,857
that help your body
get rid of old cells.

680
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:16,792
I want to get rid of
my old cells. What's in it?

681
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:18,297
Well...

682
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:21,029
It looks like the Q is quercetin,

683
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:22,898
another antioxidant found in plants.

684
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:24,769
All right, cross that
one off, and the D?

685
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:28,536
Dasatinib, that's chemo.

686
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,672
Marko's been taking chemo? He is nuts.

687
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:32,675
But wait, if he's taking dasatinib,

688
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:34,442
then he has a compromised immune system.

689
00:30:34,447 --> 00:30:37,713
And we have a whole new differential.

690
00:30:37,718 --> 00:30:38,981
Marko.

691
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:41,117
Hey, Marko.

692
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:43,052
Do you take the chemo drug dasatinib?

693
00:30:43,056 --> 00:30:46,057
Yeah, yeah, I take it every day.

694
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,571
Great vessels mobilized.

695
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:56,442
Spinal rod visualized.

696
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,355
Damage is extensive.

697
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,291
Manipulation could cause injury
to the spinal cord.

698
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,226
That's why you two are here, Kit.

699
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,428
Hold retraction steady.

700
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,766
I'll begin working on the hardware.

701
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,345
It was finally quiet in the unit.

702
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:28,247
I wanted to see how you
were doing with all of this.

703
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:31,717
Raja was my biggest win of intern year.

704
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:34,286
We saved his life. Now...

705
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:36,122
he'll never be the same again,

706
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,361
if he even gets out of this OR.

707
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:42,828
And it was all avoidable.

708
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:45,664
I can't pretend to know
what was going on in his head,

709
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:48,367
but... I can imagine.

710
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:50,439
Tell me.

711
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,273
The cancer was a trauma.

712
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:56,175
He wanted to leave it behind,

713
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,444
believe he was all better.

714
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:02,047
Couldn't tolerate knowing if he wasn't.

715
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:04,585
Okay, yeah, but...

716
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,287
... look at the consequences.

717
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:12,723
I looked away many times with my dad.

718
00:32:12,728 --> 00:32:16,361
For years, there were signs
that something was wrong,

719
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:18,996
that he was altered,

720
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:20,331
but I'd excuse it.

721
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:22,434
I'd say it was pressure

722
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:25,403
or stress or fatigue.

723
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:28,139
But then, I realized,

724
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:31,242
the next time I looked away,

725
00:32:31,247 --> 00:32:34,115
he could OD and die.

726
00:32:35,185 --> 00:32:37,182
So, you started
watching him like a hawk.

727
00:32:37,187 --> 00:32:38,349
Yeah.

728
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:41,418
But this last time, I was wrong.

729
00:32:41,423 --> 00:32:44,221
He wasn't using,
the drug test proved it.

730
00:32:44,226 --> 00:32:46,190
And I... I overreacted.

731
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:49,460
It happens to everyone
who loves an addict.

732
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:53,130
Nic had the same issue
with her sister, her father.

733
00:32:53,135 --> 00:32:56,200
She spent her whole life
trying to save them.

734
00:32:56,205 --> 00:32:59,637
In Al-Anon, they say let go.

735
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:02,173
Let them take the consequences.

736
00:33:02,178 --> 00:33:03,708
Mm-hmm.

737
00:33:03,713 --> 00:33:06,811
But, sometimes, those
consequences are death.

738
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,546
How can a family
not try to prevent that?

739
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:12,783
I think that whatever happens with Ian,

740
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:15,319
it is out of your control.

741
00:33:15,324 --> 00:33:17,190
He's a grown man.

742
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,291
Maybe the same thing is true with Raja.

743
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:24,394
Once he left the hospital,

744
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,666
it was out of your control.

745
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,770
You did everything you could, Conrad.

746
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:36,607
Thank you.

747
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,644
BP's spiking. Heart rate's slowing.

748
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:41,978
He could be herniating.

749
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:43,450
Check his pupils.

750
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:47,515
Pupils unequal.

751
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,984
The EVD. Nothing's coming out.

752
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:50,819
- Must be an obstruction.
- The ventriculitis.

753
00:33:50,824 --> 00:33:52,156
The pus must've clotted off the drain.

754
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,392
- I'll have to relieve the pressure.
- Tell me what you need.

755
00:33:54,396 --> 00:33:55,762
Craniotome to me.

756
00:34:04,405 --> 00:34:05,869
He's going into V-fib.

757
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:08,275
I feel a pulse, but it's thready.

758
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:14,110
He's coding.

759
00:34:14,115 --> 00:34:15,645
Almost done.

760
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,284
- I'll start compressions.
- Get the pads on him.

761
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:22,922
Clear!

762
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:30,039
Well, I was taking chemo,

763
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:31,994
but in-in such low doses

764
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,663
to clear dead cells,

765
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:36,099
you know, to extend my life,
not to threaten it.

766
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:37,934
- It was a perfect storm.
- Your strict diet

767
00:34:37,938 --> 00:34:39,902
and exercise left you dehydrated,

768
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:42,205
which allowed
for the metformin to build up

769
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,007
- in your bloodstream.
- That damaged your kidneys

770
00:34:44,011 --> 00:34:46,374
and caused the lactic
acidosis, and that's

771
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,344
what made you so short of breath
when doing push-ups.

772
00:34:48,348 --> 00:34:49,945
And once your kidneys were injured,

773
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,147
they couldn't metabolize
the chemo fast enough,

774
00:34:52,152 --> 00:34:54,582
so it accumulated, and you
couldn't fight infection.

775
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:56,484
Which is how you got this pneumonia.

776
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:58,920
But-but I'll be okay, right?

777
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:01,790
It'll take some time, but with
a full course of treatment,

778
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,224
you should be okay.

779
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:06,094
But you should know, Marko, that

780
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:07,929
this could've easily killed you.

781
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:10,665
Well...

782
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,567
I guess we know what this means, right?

783
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:14,936
No one lives forever.

784
00:35:14,941 --> 00:35:16,671
No.

785
00:35:16,676 --> 00:35:19,574
No, I meant that I should not
be doing this by myself.

786
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:21,142
I totally messed this up.

787
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:23,511
I should be doing this
under a doctor's supervision,

788
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:25,213
- and now I have two.
- Yes, but...

789
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:26,381
No, no, no, no. You guys

790
00:35:26,386 --> 00:35:27,549
looked at the science, right?

791
00:35:27,554 --> 00:35:29,115
You saw my protocols, the regimen,

792
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,385
you looked at the underlying data,

793
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:32,453
you had to, in order to see what I took

794
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,522
- to see what happened to me, right?
- We did, but....

795
00:35:34,526 --> 00:35:37,358
So, please, Doc, help me

796
00:35:37,363 --> 00:35:39,960
study how to slow down aging.

797
00:35:39,965 --> 00:35:41,928
A clinical trial.

798
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,401
I will completely fund it.

799
00:35:45,471 --> 00:35:48,502
I would have to think
about that some more.

800
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:49,970
I understand.

801
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:52,705
What if anti-aging

802
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,575
wasn't the only research
I was willing to fund?

803
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,411
I mean, you must have other
studies that need money, right?

804
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:00,781
Doc, I...

805
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:03,383
I don't want to just live forever.

806
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:05,922
I want my life to have meaning.

807
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:11,424
- Me, too.
- Eh.

808
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:12,959
I just want to live forever.

809
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,531
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

810
00:36:25,536 --> 00:36:27,390
I thought you would've gone home by now.

811
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:30,093
Yeah, I would've thought so,
too, but there was this case

812
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:32,395
I have to tell you about it.
I actually wanted to stay

813
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,063
and help solve it.

814
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:35,732
I've never heard you say that before.

815
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:38,368
I know. I even followed
him up to the ICU

816
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:41,371
and saved his life,
if I do say so myself.

817
00:36:41,376 --> 00:36:43,473
He might even remember my name.

818
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:44,841
It's possible.

819
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:46,910
Well, how serious is this?

820
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:50,712
Are you considering becoming
some kind of internist?

821
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:53,915
Earlier today, I wondered...

822
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,685
but I like my life as it is.

823
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,355
I just want more of it.

824
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,990
How about another
hundred years with you?

825
00:37:01,995 --> 00:37:05,093
Okay, that sounds great.

826
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:10,199
I'll explain it all on the drive home.

827
00:37:10,204 --> 00:37:12,034
Ooh, stop for some DQ

828
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:14,136
- on the way?
- Mm-hmm. Sure.

829
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:16,372
I have a craving.

830
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:41,199
I'm so sorry.

831
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:46,136
I'll never get used to this.

832
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,409
That's one of the many ways
that you are special.

833
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:10,524
Dr. Voss.

834
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:11,991
You look awfully happy.

835
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:14,594
Get this, my patient from today

836
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,663
may be writing us a check
with a whole lot

837
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:18,365
of zeroes to fund some new research.

838
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,370
I like the sound of that.
What's the story?

839
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,206
His name is Marko Zytylny, and
he first came to me with a pitch

840
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:24,474
about longevity

841
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:25,975
and anti-aging science...

842
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,675
Oh, Devon, please don't go
selling our reputation

843
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,144
to some zillionaire with
delusions of immortality.

844
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:34,713
I'm not, and it-it's not all
snake oil and chemical peels.

845
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:36,682
Besides, if we didn't
explore the fringes,

846
00:38:36,687 --> 00:38:38,817
we never would've
discovered antibiotics,

847
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:40,386
evolution, or handwashing.

848
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:43,322
Anyway, Marko is willing
to fund more than one area

849
00:38:43,327 --> 00:38:45,658
of our research. Dr. Voss, we're talking

850
00:38:45,663 --> 00:38:47,693
cancer, MS,

851
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:50,162
we name it.

852
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:53,031
Well, now that does sound interesting.

853
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:55,371
What do we have to do to make this real?

854
00:39:04,948 --> 00:39:06,179
Hello, beautiful.

855
00:39:06,184 --> 00:39:08,013
I didn't think you were coming home

856
00:39:08,017 --> 00:39:10,181
- until tomorrow.
- Well, it was either

857
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:13,184
one flight tomorrow
or two flights today.

858
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:15,990
I just couldn't wait to see you.

859
00:39:18,295 --> 00:39:19,691
Wow.

860
00:39:19,696 --> 00:39:21,359
That smells good.

861
00:39:25,635 --> 00:39:27,064
You look great.

862
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:28,933
Well, I feel great. There's no pain.

863
00:39:28,938 --> 00:39:30,868
No flare-ups. It's just like...

864
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:33,070
I'm a new man.

865
00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:36,274
And so ready to get back to you

866
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:39,076
and my OR. Okay, so...

867
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:43,814
... just tell me every
little thing I missed.

868
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:45,849
Oh, Devon and I are hot on the trail

869
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:47,551
of a major research grant.

870
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:49,253
You are such a rock star.

871
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:51,755
It's good news, but it
doesn't solve the fact

872
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,456
that the governor's cutting our funding.

873
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:55,759
Well, it's lucky I'm in fighting shape.

874
00:39:55,764 --> 00:39:57,997
You do look healthy.

875
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:02,099
You'd tell me
if you weren't, right? If...

876
00:40:02,104 --> 00:40:04,438
if there's something I should ask?

877
00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:08,038
Not at all. I'm good.

878
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:10,273
I-I really am.

879
00:40:10,278 --> 00:40:13,677
Where is this coming from?

880
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:15,812
Rough case.

881
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:18,514
I know what will make me smile.

882
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,884
Showing you photos
of the exquisite venue

883
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:24,387
I booked for us, where,
in a few short weeks,

884
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:26,689
I will marry the man of my dreams.

885
00:40:26,694 --> 00:40:28,258
Can I get an invitation?

886
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:35,698
I am so unbelievably happy you're home.

887
00:40:47,282 --> 00:40:50,479
So, I was thinking we should try
that new Brazilian restaurant.

888
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:51,516
Sure.

889
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:56,919
Hey, are you sure you're
okay not having kids?

890
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:59,889
- Um, what?
- Look at this.

891
00:40:59,894 --> 00:41:02,124
They're little miracles.

892
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:03,695
How can I deny you that?

893
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:06,396
Are we seriously doing this right now?

894
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:09,636
I just don't want you to resent me.

895
00:41:11,438 --> 00:41:13,302
Well, are you changing your mind?

896
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,537
No.

897
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:17,242
I don't know.

898
00:41:23,783 --> 00:41:25,780
I always thought I'd be a father,

899
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:27,882
but helping out for two weeks
with those newborns

900
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:30,818
and Padma while she recovered?

901
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:32,387
It wasn't all roses.

902
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:35,823
I mean, it was sort of a reality check.

903
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:39,894
I mean, it's nice, you know,
being the auntie and uncle.

904
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:42,030
Those babies are cute and all,

905
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:45,499
but you know what else is so cute?

906
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,168
Hmm?

907
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:50,441
The patio at that Brazilian restaurant.

908
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:53,610
Come on.

909
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,421
Hey.

910
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,540
