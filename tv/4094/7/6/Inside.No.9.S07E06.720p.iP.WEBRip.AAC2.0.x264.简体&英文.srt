今天是我妹妹的生日
It's my sister's birthday today.

14
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,080
我6岁了
I'm six!

15
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,920
她得到了一个新的风筝
She got a new kite.

16
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,800
我答应妈妈
I promised Mummy 

17
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,520
去外面玩风筝时 我会照顾好妹妹的
I would watch her while we played with it outside.

18
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,400
该我玩了
It's my turn now.

19
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,560
这是我的生日礼物
No, it's my present 

20
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,470
我想自己放风筝
and I want to fly it.

21
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,880
别哭 它在上面呢 看
Don't cry. I can see it up there. Look.

22
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,640
太高了
It's very high.

23
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,760
没关系 我能爬上去的
That's all right. I can climb up.

24
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,280
傻瓜 傻瓜
Twit-you. Twit-you!

25
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,800
你好 聪明的猫头鹰
Hello, Wise Owl.

26
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,720
你好 聪明的猫头鹰
Hello, Wise Owl.

27
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,160
傻瓜 
Twit-you.

28
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,120
只有傻瓜才会爬上去
Only a fool would climb up there.

29
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,360
你们没看到警告牌吗
Didn't you see the warning sign?

30
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,520
有电危险
Pylons kill.

31
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,520
别靠近这里
Stay away from them.

32
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,080
我不会碰电线的
I won't touch the wires.

33
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,720
那也不行
That doesn't matter.

34
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,600
风筝的金属线是可以导电的
The electricity will be conducted through the kite's metal rods.

35
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,160
那我的风筝怎么办
But what about my present?

36
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,880
看我们的风朋友能不能帮忙了
Let's see if our friend the wind can help.

37
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,040
谢谢你 聪明的猫头鹰
Thanks, Wise Owl!

38
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,280
谢谢你 聪明的猫头鹰
Thanks, Wise Owl.

39
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,600
别做傻瓜
Don't be a twit-you. 

40
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,030
不要触电
Leave electricity alone.

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,400
傻瓜 傻瓜
Twit-you. Twit-you!

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,760
哦 你好 是奥利弗先生吗
Oh, hello. Is that Mr Oliver?

43
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,720
我是德雷克·布兰肯 住在鹿场那边
It's Derek Blenkin here. I live on Deerfold.

44
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,230
去年你给我邻居的短尾狗做过标本
You did my neighbour's bobtail last year.

45
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,720
他叫佩珀医生
Dr Pepper.

46
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,680
抱歉 我是不是找错了
Sorry, have I got the right house?

47
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,160
你是做标本的吗
You do do taxidermy?

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,760
嗯 是这么回事
Right. Well, what it is, 

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,190
我们刚刚度假回来
we've just come back off our holidays

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
安排了清洁工
and we'd left our cleaner

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,840
来喂我女儿的宠物兔子 法拉利
to feed our daughter's pet rabbit, Ferrari.

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,520
法拉利是那只兔子 不是我女儿
That's the rabbit, not me daughter.

53
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,500
她想给它喂点好吃的
Anyway, she wanted to give it a treat,

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,420
长话短说吧
and to cut a long story sideways,

55
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,000
她不小心喂了它一袋巧克力
she's accidentally fed it a bag of chocolate buttons

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,110
然后兔子就死了
and now it's dead.

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,680
你在听吗
Are you there?

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,680
我不该和陌生人说话
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

59
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,600
其实
Well, um...

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,560
我们把它放在冰箱里冻了一宿
..we've had it in the fridge overnight.

61
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,520
我女儿还不知道 她才五岁
My daughter doesn't know yet. She's only five.

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,840
你能不能把它做成标本
And I was wondering if you could preserve him for us?

63
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,280
法拉利
Ferrari.

64
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,320
她不会看出来的
She won't know the difference.

65
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,360
我会跟她说兔子累了
I'll just tell her it's always tired.

66
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,080
我邻居说你的要价比较便宜
My neighbour said you'd do us a good price.

67
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,480
你不用把它弄得
I don't need it all dressed up

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,160
像彼得兔那么漂亮
and doing ballet like a Beatrix Potter.

69
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,800
我会把它藏在铺着稻草的角落里
It'll just be in the corner of the hutch covered in straw.

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,170
基本上没人会看到它
You'll barely see it.

71
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,400
我们只是还没想好
It's just...we're not ready

72
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,630
怎么和她聊死亡的话题
for the whole death conversation yet.

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,720
倒是该跟我妈聊聊了
We've got all that to come with my mother.

74
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,640
哦 非常感谢
Oh, thanks very much.

75
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,640
我说了 给个折扣就行
As I say, any discount gratefully received. And...

76
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,760
而且要是能便宜的话 没有腿也行
..It needn't even have legs if that's cheaper.

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,520
那就这样
OK.

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,160
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you too.

79
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,220
假期里有一天天气特别好
One day on our holidays the weather was so nice

80
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,600
我们就来到了海边
we came to the beach.

81
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,630
我想去海里游泳
I want to go in the sea.

82
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,920
妈妈带妹妹去划船了
Mummy took my sister paddling

83
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,040
我开始挖沙造城堡
and I started to make a sandcastle.

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,400
正玩得高兴
I was happy playing, 

85
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,430
有个人过来跟我说话
when a man came to talk to me.

86
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,560
他说我长得可爱又阳光
He said I looked nice and shiny,

87
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,240
问我想不想去看海星
and did I want to see a starfish?

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,960
我觉得挺好玩的
I thought that sounded fun.

89
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,400
傻瓜 傻瓜
Twit-you. Twit-you!

90
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,040
你不认识这个人
You don't know who this man is.

91
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
他或许看上去很友善
He may seem friendly 

92
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,950
可未必有好心
but his intentions might not be.

93
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,120
你妈妈是怎么说陌生人的
What did your mummy tell you about strangers?

94
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,440
别跟陌生人说话
That I shouldn't talk to them?

95
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,920
没错
Exactly.

96
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,800
别当傻瓜
Don't be a twit-you.

97
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,920
别离开爸爸妈妈身边
Always stay safe with your mummy and daddy.

98
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,240
聪明的猫头鹰什么都知道
Wise Owl knows best.

99
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,200
妈妈
Mummy...

100
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,920
妈妈
Mummy!

101
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,640
妈妈
Mummy!

102
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,800
今天是我妹妹的生日
It's my sister's birthday today.

103
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
我6岁了
I'm six!

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,120
她得到了一个娃娃
She got a doll, 

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,190
一套茶具 还有一个风筝
a tea set and a kite.

106
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,120
现在就等妈妈回来
Now we're waiting for Mummy to get home

107
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
给她点生日蛋糕上的蜡烛了
so we can light the candles on her cake.

108
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
我现在就想点
I want to do it now.

109
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,200
我知道火柴在哪里
I know where they keep the matches.

110
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,440
看
Look!

111
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,720
你好 妈妈
Hi, Mum. 

112
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,550
罗尼
Ronnie?

113
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,790
我都要睡了
I'm getting ready for bed.

114
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,400
现在才8点一刻
It's only quarter past eight.

115
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,920
我正喝酒呢 想起给你打个电话
I'm calling you between Corries.

116
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,140
你还好吧
Are you all right?

117
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,840
我挺好的
Yeah.

118
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,910
我去找过你 但你不在
I came round earlier. You weren't in.

119
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
我去忙了
I've been busy.

120
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,800
我要把一只兔子做成标本
I had to stuff a Ferrari.

121
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,120
一只什么
A what?

122
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
就是别人的宠物
It's someone's pet.

123
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,920
我们养过一只猫 你还记得吗
We had a cat, do you remember? 

124
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,520
你和乔安妮小时候养的
when you and Joanne were little.

125
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,080
叫米姆西
Mimsy.

126
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,120
我们最后把它处理掉了
We got rid of it in the end.

127
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,230
它让你得了哮喘
It made you wheeze.

128
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,640
它看你的眼神很轻蔑
And it had this way of looking at you all superior,

129
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,280
感觉你就像是它鞋子上的尘土
like you were just muck on its shoe.

130
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,360
猫是不穿鞋的
Cats don't wear shoes.

131
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,840
你明白我在说什么就行了
Well, you know what I mean.

132
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,800
我就是想确认一下
Anyway I'm just checking

133
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,760
你星期一还过来吗
that you're still coming on Monday.

134
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,120
你已经有三年没回家了
You haven't been in over three years.

135
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,320
迪内托大夫的话还记得吧
You know what Dr Dinetto said.

136
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,960
他又不认识我
He doesn't know me.

137
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,280
他什么都不知道
He doesn't know anything.

138
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,720
我能照顾好自己的
I can look after myself.

139
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,160
我知道你行的 我就是希望你能回家来
I know you can. I'd just like you to be there, 

140
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,670
仅此而已 为了我
that's all. For me.

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,320
穿靴子的猫 穿上靴子就得
Puss in Boots, he wore shoes, so...

142
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,440
我爸会在吗
Will Dad be there?

143
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,760
不知道 
I'm not sure.

144
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,880
我问过他 可他大概不会来吧
I asked him, but he might not show up.

145
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,960
你知道他就那样
You know what he's like.

146
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,640
估计你也没和他联系吧
I don't suppose you've heard from him?

147
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,080
我们都是按自己的方式做事 是吧
We all deal with things in our own way, don't we?

148
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,400
答应我一定要回来
Promise me you'll come.

149
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,640
好的
OK. 

150
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,640
还有 回来之前别干傻事
And you won't...do anything silly before then?

151
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,000
答应我
Promise?

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,640
答应你了
Promise.

153
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,520
那就好 我明天再给你打电话 亲爱的
All right, then, I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart.

154
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,760
再见
Bye.

155
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,360
我爱
I love...

156
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,360
今天是她生日
It was her birthday.

157
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480
罗尼 你这是为什么呀 为什么
Why did you do it, Ronnie? Why?!

158
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,800
你明知道这样不对
You knew it was wrong!

159
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,040
什么都别说
You mustn't say anything.

160
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,160
你要做什么
What do you want?

161
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,760
聪明的猫头鹰什么都知道
Wise Owl knows best.

162
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
这是我妹妹的猫 米姆西
This is my sister's cat, Mimsy.

163
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,760
有一天它生病死了
One day he got poorly and died.

164
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,840
我跟她说别担心 它去了猫的天堂
I told her not to worry and that he was in cat heaven now.

165
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,960
我不想让它走
Don't want to let him go

166
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,520
我想让它永远留在我们身边
I wish we could keep him for ever.

167
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,800
那是不可能的
But that's impossible.

168
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,760
傻瓜 傻瓜
Twit-you! Twit-you!

169
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,320
聪明的猫头鹰
Wise Owl!

170
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,280
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

171
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,880
孩子们 你们没听说过动物标本吗
Have you children never heard of taxidermy?

172
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,600
动物什么
Taxi-what?

173
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
标本
Dermy.

174
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,280
就是一种把你最喜欢的宠物
It's a way of keeping your favourite pets

175
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,360
永远留在身边的方法
around for ever.

176
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,760
我教给你们看看
Let me show you.

177
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,560
你需要 手术刀 一些镀锌电线
You will need...A scalpel, some galvanised wire,

178
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,200
刮刀和化学染料
a scraper and tanning chemicals.

179
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,520
使用前务必一定要阅读说明
Always read the label.

180
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,280
首先 你需要先把皮剥开
First, you need to peel the skin off.

181
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,960
在腿部和腹部周围做切口
Make incisions around the legs and tummy.

182
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,640
然后慢慢的把动物皮从尸体上扯下来
Then pull the animal's pelt slowly from its carcass.

183
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,160
用手术刀摘掉眼睛
Then you remove the eyes with the scalpel.

184
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,000
这个我能帮上忙
I can do this for you.

185
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,040
然后在壁炉里焚化尸体
You can dispose of the body in an incinerator.

186
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,600
接着 把皮肤用化学染料浸泡一天时间
Next, use the chemicals to tan the skin for 24 hours.

187
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,040
这正是玩游戏或者吃三明治的好时刻
This is a good time to play a game or have a sandwich.

188
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,680
接下来 用泡沫做出个一样大小的模型
Next, make a body shape from foam,

189
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,680
用铁丝固定住 站着原地
using wire to keep it in place.

190
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,360
然后把染好颜色的皮
Then, pull the tanned hide

191
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,600
套在模型上
back onto the model.

192
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,040
就像往它皮里塞香肠一样
Like putting a sausage into its skin!

193
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
正是如此
Exactly.

194
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,600
选个玻璃眼睛 以匹配你的宠物
Select glass eyes to match your pet's

195
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,080
轻轻的塞进模型的眼球里
and gently force them into the sockets.

196
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,760
适当调整其位置
Scrunch and pull it into position

197
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,280
用针线把所有东西重新缝好
and use a needle and thread to stitch everything back together

198
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,800
转眼间
and, hey presto!

199
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,640
你知道怎么做后将变得很容易
Easy when you know how.

200
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,320
谢谢你 聪明的猫头鹰
Thanks, Wise Owl.

201
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,040
它就和新的一样
He's as good as new!

202
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,080
你好 我们改主意了
Yeah, we've had a change of heart

203
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,880
我想把法拉利带回去
and I'd like to get Ferrari back, please,

204
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,240
不用做标本了
just as he was.

205
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,520
你还没动手吧
You haven't touched him, have you?

206
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,240
真正的奥利弗先生在家吗
Is the real Mr Oliver in?

207
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,920
我和邻居聊过了
I were chatting to my neighbour

208
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,640
她说这家主人是个70多岁的老先生
and she said he's a gentleman in his 70s,

209
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,240
所以肯定不是你 对吧
so that's not you, is it?

210
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,080
那你是谁
So who are you, then?

211
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,680
你怎么会在这里
What are you even doing here?

212
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,520
你最好没对它做什么
You'd better not have done anything to him.

213
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,560
谁
Who?

214
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,000
当然是法拉利
Ferrari!

215
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,440
我现在就要把它带走
Now, can I have him back, please,

216
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,520
不然就要报警了
or am I going to have to call the police?

217
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,520
谢谢
Thank you.

218
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
我的天啊
Oh, dear God!

219
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,040
这是什么东西
What the hell do you call this?

220
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,520
太恶心了
It's disgusting!

221
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,600
你让我怎么跟我女儿说
What am I going to tell my daughter now, eh?

222
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
她要是看到这个肯定会做噩梦的
She'll have bloody nightmares if she sees this!

223
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,440
该死的僵尸兔
Bloody Franken-rabbit!

224
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,080
你等着警察上门吧
You want reporting! 

225
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,310
你这疯子
You're sick!

226
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,400
死的本该是你 罗尼
It should have been you, Ronnie.

227
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,070
罗尼
Ronnie...

228
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,040
你好 爸爸
Hi, Dad.

229
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,640
给
Here.

230
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,400
你吓了我一跳
You gave me quite a shock.

231
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,080
你得把修窗户的钱给我
You'll have to give me the money for that window, you know.

232
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,880
喝吧
Cheers.

233
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,320
你不该喝这么多的
You shouldn't drink so much.

234
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,840
这才多少
It's only a nip.

235
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,280
我刚从皮克林回来
I've just come back from Pickering.

236
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,640
玩具博物馆举办了
They had a '70s weekend

237
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,880
一场70年代的周末秀
at the toy museum.

238
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,360
去了不少像我这样的老家伙
A few of the old buggers like me wheeled out.

239
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,760
雷·布鲁克斯
Ray Brooks.

240
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,880
来自皮普金斯的奈杰尔
Nigel from Pipkins.

241
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,440
他是个笨家伙 
One of the Bungles -

242
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,320
不过不吓人
not the scary one.

243
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,840
我们玩得挺开心的
We had a laugh.

244
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,420
过去20多年
I don't suppose you've followed

245
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,720
你应该没关注过我的工作吧
my career over the last 20-odd years?

246
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,080
你住的地方
Did they have a telly in...

247
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,560
有电视吗
..where you were,

248
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,880
还是说他们不许你看电视呢
or were you not allowed?

249
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,240
《聪明的猫头鹰》拍完之后
I didn't do much

250
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,020
我就没做什么节目了
after Wise Owl finished.

251
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,320
有过几次剧目巡演
Couple of theatre tours.

252
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,840
和杰夫·霍兰德玩得不错
Nice two-hander with Jeff Holland.

253
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,280
不过在那件事之后
Everything was a bit tainted after...

254
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,800
做什么都没意思了
well, you know.

255
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,260
三四年前他们想做个重制版
They were thinking of bringing him back three or four years ago.

256
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,280
用电脑动画 做出来也是垃圾
Computer animation. It would have been crap.

257
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,760
反正很不成功
Anyway, it all fizzled out, so...

258
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,680
所以我现在就做这个了
..I do this now.

259
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
你不会相信有多少人
You'd be surprised how many people

260
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
想要留住过去的东西
want to preserve something of the past,

261
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,200
留住一份记忆
keep a memory alive.

262
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,240
定格某个快乐的时刻
Freeze-frame of a happy moment. 

263
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,360
我做过最大的标本是一只山羊
The biggest thing I've done is a goat.

264
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,840
花了我将近一个月的时间
I spent nearly a month on that.

265
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,680
有个小老太太带着羊来找我
A little old lady brought him in.

266
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,460
她给羊取名叫潘
She called him Pan.

267
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,280
她也许是个女巫
Probably a witch.

268
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,200
不过我还从没做过猫头鹰的标本
Funnily enough, I've never done an owl.

269
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,080
我确实也不想做
I don't think I'd want to.

270
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,400
说说你在这里做什么
So, are you going to tell me what you're doing here?

271
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
是你妈让你来的吗
Did your mum put you up to it?

272
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,640
你知道周一是什么日子 对吧
You know what day Monday is, don't you?

273
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,240
周一
Monday?

274
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,240
哦 那件事
Oh. That.

275
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,920
她要是活着该有50岁了
She'd have been 50.

276
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,320
是吗
Really?

277
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,560
时光如梭啊
Time flies.

278
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,120
我的信你收到过吗
Did you get my letters?

279
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,680
收到过几封
Yes, I had a few.

280
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,080
没怎么看
I couldn't read half of them. 

281
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,830
你的笔迹太潦草了
Your handwriting's shocking.

282
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,720
你就
Did you never...

283
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
你就从没想回来看看我吗
Did you never want to come and see me?

284
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,360
你妈不让我回来
Your mother said not to.

285
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,800
她说我回来只会让事情变得更糟
Said it would only make it worse.

286
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,480
反正是无法挽回了
It's all water under the bridge now anyway.

287
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,080
过来
Come here.

288
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,720
你不该再内疚了 明白吗 罗尼
You mustn't feel guilty, you know, Ronnie.

289
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
那只是个意外
It was just an accident.

290
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,440
我并不怪你
I don't blame you, 

291
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,430
不用担心我的态度
if that's what you're worried about.

292
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,920
那天是我妹妹的生日
It was my sister's birthday.

293
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,840
我6岁了
I'm six!

294
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,520
她得到了一个娃娃
She got a doll,

295
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,880
一套茶具 还有一个风筝
a tea set and a kite.

296
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,400
现在就等妈妈回来
Now we're waiting for Mummy to come home

297
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,800
给她点生日蛋糕上的蜡烛了
so we can light the candles on her cake.

298
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
我现在就想点
I want to do it now.

299
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,240
我知道他们把火柴放在哪里了
I know where they keep the matches.

300
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,360
看
Look!

301
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,680
你不该玩火柴 乔安妮
You shouldn't play with matches, Joanne.

302
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
对吧 聪明的猫头鹰
Isn't that right, Wise Owl?

303
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,640
聪明的猫头鹰
Wise Owl?

304
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,880
怎么了
What?!

305
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,960
乔安妮想点蜡烛
Joanne wants to light her candles

306
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,760
可我告诉她这很危险
but I told her it's dangerous.

307
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,200
傻瓜 
Twit-you!

308
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,880
火柴盒上不是写了吗
What does it say on the box?

309
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,320
你不会自己看吗
Can't you read?

310
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,480
安全火柴
"Safety matches."

311
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,840
那不就行了 
Exactly!

312
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,160
安全火柴很安全
They're safe.

313
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,240
她想点就让她点吧
If she wants to light her candles, let her light them.

314
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,920
今天是她的生日
It's her birthday.

315
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,160
谢谢你 聪明的猫头鹰
Thanks, Wise Owl.

316
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,520
你不等妈妈回来再说吗
Are you sure we shouldn't wait for Mummy?

317
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,320
你不等妈妈回来再说吗
"Are you sure we shouldn't wait for Mummy?"

318
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,960
怎么什么事都要问别人
Why do you have to ask permission for everything?

319
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,120
你胆子太小了 罗尼 我的天啊
Grow some balls, Ronnie, for fuck's sake!

320
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,760
他说脏话
He said "balls".

321
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,320
可是
But... 

322
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,520
别忘了 聪明的猫头鹰总是对的
Wise Owl's always right, remember?

323
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,600
现在让乔安妮许愿
Now, come on...let's leave Joanne to make her wish.

324
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,680
你跟我到楼上去
You're coming upstairs with me.

325
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,440
我想留在这里
I'd rather stay here.

326
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,800
聪明的猫头鹰什么都知道
Wise Owl knows best.

327
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,040
然后呢
Now, what?

328
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,560
进去
In there.

329
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,720
坐下
Sit down.

330
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,200
罗尼
Ronnie...

331
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,760
你坐下
Sit...down!

332
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,000
为什么把责任推给我
Why did you let me take the blame?

333
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,800
好了 别纠结于过去了
Oh, let's not dredge up the past.

334
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,050
你说你在从酒吧回家的路上
You said you were on your way home from the pub

335
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,520
看到房子着火了
when you saw the house on fire.

336
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,640
你说你从窗户爬进去救了我
You said you climbed in through a window and you rescued me.

337
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,400
你是英雄
You were the hero.

338
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,520
可你说谎了 对吗
But that's not true, is it?

339
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
你就在房子里
You were in here.

340
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,120
和我在一起
With me.

341
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,440
你肯定是记错了 儿子
I think you're remembering it wrong, son.

342
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,680
我没记错
I don't think so.

343
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,200
我还有事业呢
I had a career to protect.

344
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,400
我是公共信息影片公司的喉舌
I was the voice of the public information films

345
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,880
我女儿在火灾中被活活烧死了
and my daughter gets burned alive in a fire.

346
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,960
这和我的形象很不符
Not very on brand, is it?

347
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,560
你说我该怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

348
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,720
我信任你
I trusted you.

349
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:18,960
我一直很听聪明猫头鹰的话
I always did...everything...Wise Owl said.

350
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,600
那只是个游戏 罗尼
That was just a game, Ronnie.

351
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,360
没什么不好的
It wasn't doing any harm.

352
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,920
你不也喜欢这游戏吗
You enjoyed it.

353
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,960
我爱你
I loved you,

354
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,580
也爱乔安妮
and Joanne.

355
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,140
过来
Now...come on,

356
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,190
到我这儿来
come and join me.

357
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,760
别傻了
Don't be a twit-you.

358
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,880
给你老爸一个拥抱
Give your old man a hug.

359
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,360
别伤害我
Don't hurt me, please!

360
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,020
你还想陷入当年的处境吗
Do you want to be put back in that place?

361
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,400
你住手 我就什么都不说
Stop this now and I won't say anything. 

362
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,270
不
No.

363
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,760
我会说的
But I will.

364
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,200
罗尼
Ronnie!

365
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,840
罗尼 你什么意思
Ronnie! What did you mean? 

366
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,950
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

367
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,240
去找我妈
To see Mum.

368
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,720
把一切告诉她
I'm going to tell her.

369
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,480
告诉她什么呀
T-Tell her... Tell her what exactly?

370
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,720
真相
Everything.

371
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,520
不 不 今晚就算了
No, no, no. Stop the night here.

372
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,560
我们再谈谈
Let's just talk some more.

373
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,840
你不能去
You can't go.

374
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,480
罗尼 你什么都不能说
Ronnie! You mustn't say anything.

375
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,000
聪明的猫头鹰不许你说
Wise Owl won't let you.

376
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,960
我们必须始终按聪明的猫头鹰说的去做
And we must always do what Wise Owl says...

377
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,360
对吗
..mustn't we?

378
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,400
不再是了
Not any more.

379
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,740
罗尼 你回来
Ronnie, stop!

380
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,460
傻瓜 傻瓜
Twit-you! Twit-you!

381
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,240
傻瓜 傻瓜
Twit-you! Twit-you!

382
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,400
滚吧
Get stuffed.
