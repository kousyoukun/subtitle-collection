5
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,220
Laurence!

6
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,020
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,740
How are you?

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,100
Hey, Callum!

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,340
You're looking good!

10
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,700
I think the last time I saw you was this century, wasn't it?

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,540
It was. Kenzie's wedding, so June 2010.

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,580
Was it really?

13
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,540
Yeah. God, poor old Kenzie.

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,020
Poor Kenzie's wife.

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,340
Well, quite. Are they still together?

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,050
No, no, no. He lives in Germany now.

17
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,300
We're Facebook friends.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,950
Are you? Well, you know, I don't do any of that social media crap.

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,820
No, I noticed.

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,900
You didn't want to be LinkedIn, in spite of several attempts.

21
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,420
Bless you for trying, Laurence, but I'm too old.

22
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,100
I prefer seeing people face-to-face.

23
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,260
Every 12 years.

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,900
Exactly.

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,380
Anyway,

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,180
-Can you give me a hand with this?-Yeah!

27
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,740
It's very quiet.

28
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,220
You haven't lured me here under false pretences, have you?

29
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,500
Closed for the winter.

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,660
A friend of Bonnie's runs it. She let me have the key.

31
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,380
How is Bonnie? Will we get to see her today?

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,220
Ah, yeah. Yeah, she'll be...here later.

33
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,900
How's...your partner?

34
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,420
Pablo?

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,620
Oh, you know, we muddle through.

36
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,460
He's doing an online course in fine art at the moment,

37
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,300
which is bewildering to me, but never mind.

38
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,740
-He'd have loved this.-Yeah. Beautiful, isn't it?

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,220
Remind you of the good old days?

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,420
Which good old days?

41
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,660
Uni!

42
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,300
We used to go for those big walks round the lake.

43
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,860
Yeah. A little bit.

44
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,980
So few places nowadays where you can actually find peace.

45
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,360
Oi, oi, saveloy!

46
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,100
Oh, Jesus, you never told me Darren was coming.

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,860
I told you it was a reunion. Hi, Dazza!

48
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,500
All right, lads? How are we?

49
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,060
Come here! Give us a hug!

50
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,420
Ohhh! So good to see you, mate!

51
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,180
Yeah, you too.

52
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,580
Hey, you've still got the old university scarf, you saddo!

53
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,300
This is my third one. They keep updating it.

54
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,900
I think this one has got a slightly...

55
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,260
And Cal's all glammed up

56
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,300
in his Marks & Sparks Blue Harbour gear.

57
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,340
Er, Hugo Boss, you cheeky sod!

58
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,860
What have you come as?

59
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,020
You look like a homeless Shakin' Stevens.

60
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,180
Eh, it's the latest fashions.

61
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,700
Do they not have this in that London, eh?

62
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,580
It's been a while, hasn't it?

63
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,460
Kenzie's wedding, apparently.

64
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,660
Oh, God, yeah, course. Is he coming?

65
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,060
No, no, he's in Germany.

66
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,260
It's just us three,

67
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,020
like in the good old days. The three amigos.

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,140
What? I thought it was

69
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,380
like a big fuck-off party cruise with loads of people.

70
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,580
Sorry, have I got the shit end of the stick here?

71
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,340
No, no, it's going to be great.

72
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:22,980
I've got it all planned.

73
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,280
We're going to get out on the lake when it gets dark.

74
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,780
We've got so much to catch up on.

75
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,420
Fuckin' hell!

76
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,770
Anyone got a dock leaf?

77
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,620
I think I've just stung me fanny on a nettle.

78
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,180
Sorry, "front bum".

79
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,380
Hiya!

80
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,700
Who's this?

81
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,090
It's me new bird, Donna.

82
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,980
-I promised her we were going out on a boat.-We are.

83
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,300
Oh, shit...

84
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,940
-Hello, hello.-Hi.

85
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,180
I'm Donna. Pleased to meet you.

86
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,660
-Laurence.-Hi! Callum.

87
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,220
Hey, it's well nice here, innit?

88
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,380
Me mum's got a tray like this.

89
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,530
Wait till I tell her!

90
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,620
Hey, has the yacht got an inside bit?

91
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,100
Cos I'm freezing me tits off already.

92
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,820
Er, Darren, could you give me a hand?

93
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,780
Oh, yeah, course.

94
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,970
What are you playing at?

95
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,100
The invite was for you only.

96
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,340
Well, I was trying to impress her, wasn't I?

97
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,100
We've only been shagging for a few weeks.

98
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,780
I wanted it to be just the four of us.

99
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,020
It is!

100
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,030
What's the matter, Larry?

101
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,140
I wish you'd told me,

102
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,620
that's all. It makes things very awkward.

103
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,420
It's awkward for me, an' all.

104
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,660
I thought it was all plus-ones and wristbands.

105
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,060
She's missing her mate's hen do for this.

106
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,500
So, does this take us to the party boat?

107
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,520
Yeah.

108
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,170
Yeah, just, er, jump on the paedo and we'll be off.

109
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,820
You what?

110
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,020
We're just going to have a quick go on the paedo.

111
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,380
You mean "pedalo".

112
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,820
Is that what it's called?

113
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,460
I thought they were called paedos.

114
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,660
I thought it was a bit weird!

115
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,740
Right, well, come on, let's cast off.

116
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,020
Ladies first.

117
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,900
I'm not sitting in that. The seats are all wet.

118
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,300
Actually, the cold water will help with your vaginal irritation.

119
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,380
Er, 'scuse me, his name is Darren.

120
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,140
She got you!

121
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,680
Here we go. Whoopsie-daisy.

122
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,320
Ok? You ready? Hold on tight.

123
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,380
Bloody hell! These are brand-new!

124
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,940
You all right? Come on.

125
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,740
Oh... Christ!

126
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,420
Here we go.

127
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,100
I haven't done this for years!

128
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,780
Hey, it's great, innit?

129
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,140
Going to be like Ibiza, babe! Whoo-whoo!

130
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,940
Whoa, this is cool, isn't it?

131
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,980
It's charming.

132
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,780
Three Men In A Boat, To Say Nothing Of The Dog.

133
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,060
Er, sorry, say that again.

134
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,300
It's, er, Jerome K Jerome. Full title.

135
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,060
Only five minutes, and he's calling me a dog.

136
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,620
Probably just admiring your puppies.

137
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,500
I thought you said he was, er...

138
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,980
Oh, no, that's me.

139
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,380
Oh! Could never tell.

140
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,940
Are you the one that knows Judge Rinder off Strictly?

141
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,420
Our paths have crossed.

142
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,180
Cos Darren said he's going to be at the party.

143
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,100
I only said he might be!

144
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,740
I only said he might be.

145
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,940
Well, stranger things have happened at sea.

146
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,020
So, you were all at school together?

147
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,820
No, university.

148
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,160
Callum was a medical student.

149
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,260
I was reading psychology.

150
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,310
Oh, I've seen that,

151
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,700
where she gets stabbed in t'shower.

152
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,100
I didn't know they'd made a book of it, though.

153
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,580
What did you do?

154
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,100
Er, nothing.

155
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,300
I dropped out in t'second year. It was boring.

156
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,900
Darren was studying, er, sports science,

157
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,100
if that's not an oxymoron.

158
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,300
Bloody hell! He's calling you a dog

159
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,660
and me a moron.

160
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,700
I thought you were supposed to be my mate.

161
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,860
He still teaches there, y'know, Phil Crawford.

162
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,300
Does he? Creepy Crawford?

163
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,380
He was a bit of a pedalo. How do you know?

164
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,060
Oh, didn't I tell you? I work there.

165
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,180
At our uni?

166
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,580
The psychology department. Since when?

167
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,660
About eight years! I put it all in my Christmas round-robin.

168
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,900
Don't you read them?

169
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,620
Oh, I think it must just go straight into my spam folder.

170
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,740
Bloody hell!

171
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,380
So, what's it like there now?

172
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,860
Oh, it's exactly the same.

173
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,940
The library, the common room...

174
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,560
They even dress up the Newton statue

175
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,440
every freshers' week.

176
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,580
What statue?

177
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,220
The Isaac Newton one!

178
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,740
We put a dress on it in our first week,

179
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,100
with apples for breasts.

180
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,340
Don't you remember?

181
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,380
Vaguely.

182
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,140
Come on! I remember it like it was yesterday.

183
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,660
It was the funniest thing ever!

184
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,340
You need to get out more.

185
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,740
Shall we just drift for a bit...

186
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,300
..take in the view?

187
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,140
How about you two, then? Where did you meet?

188
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,750
Five Guys.

189
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,580
He spilt an Oreo milkshake all down me back.

190
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,420
I think he was just trying to get my attention.

191
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,220
Worked, though, didn't it?

192
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,860
Sounds very romantic.

193
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,820
Have you been in Five Guys, Callum?

194
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,540
Oh, at least.

195
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,020
So, are you and Bonnie still living in the same place?

196
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,420
Yeah. Yeah. Rattling round now, of course,

197
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,340
cos Alex is at uni. I'm an empty-nester.

198
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,820
How about your two?

199
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
Oh, smashing, yeah.

200
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,180
Yeah, I don't get to see them as much as I'd like, y'know.

201
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,300
But I've got them for a couple of weeks in the summer.

202
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
You wanna go t'Disney, don't you?

203
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,060
Yeah. You can have breakfast with the characters.

204
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
I can't decide between Goofy's Kitchen

205
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,220
and Ariel's Grotto.

206
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,450
Not sure I fancy eating

207
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,140
somewhere called Ariel's Grotto.

208
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,620
Oh, I would! Don't ruin it, you pig!

209
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,860
Pabby and I are going to take the girls to Cornwall

210
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,300
this year, have a staycation.

211
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,920
You've got girls? I didn't know.

212
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,100
Yeah, five and nine.

213
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,140
Well, good for you! What are their names?

214
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,580
Millie and Liza.

215
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,500
We're absolutely run off our feet with them,

216
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,120
but you adjust, don't you?

217
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,980
Your life becomes about them.

218
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,220
Oh, yeah, true. Do you have pictures?

219
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,500
Yeah, of course!

220
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,020
Proud dad!

221
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,380
Actually, I'm a grandfather now.

222
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,060
You what?

223
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,380
Yeah. We took Millie to a breeding kennel.

224
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,140
She had a litter of five.

225
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,620
Our beautiful girls.

226
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,900
Oh. I see.

227
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,580
Not quite the same thing.

228
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,100
Anyway, shall we press on?

229
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,540
Oh, hang on, hang on. I'm not ready yet.

230
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,140
Can I have a go at pedalling?

231
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,980
It'd be good for me glutes.

232
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,900
No, you don't know where we're going. I do.

233
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Oh, let her have a go. What's the problem?

234
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,820
I just don't want to veer off course, that's all.

235
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,580
Come on, Laurence, it's not Shackleton.

236
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,300
-She can swap with me.-Thanks.

237
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,930
Help me, then!

238
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,140
All right, there we go.

239
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,060
Whoopsie-daisy!

240
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,940
Careful!

241
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,540
Right, how do you work it?

242
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,260
You just put your feet on the pedals.

243
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Hey, it's fun, innit?

244
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,140
Right, let's get to this party!

245
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,500
Fuckin' hell.

246
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,700
This is hard work, innit?

247
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,420
It's like a spin class.

248
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
How long have I been doing it?

249
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,100
Two minutes.

250
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,340
Ohhh! Sweating cobs!

251
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,020
Can't have Judge Rinder seeing me like this.

252
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,020
Will there be cabins on the boat to freshen up?

253
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,180
Who wants a bevvy?

254
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,540
-Larry? -No, thank you.

255
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,460
-Cal? -Why not?

256
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,900
Do you want them Doritos, babe?

257
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,510
This time yesterday,

258
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,100
I was draining a pelvic abscess.

259
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,660
Don't say that, you're making we want a wee.

260
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,380
So, er, are you still at the Royal Free?

261
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,810
Yeah, head of obs and gynae now,

262
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,860
which is quite a responsibility.

263
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,100
Well done, mate. I'm really proud of you.

264
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,780
Thank you.

265
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,100
How about you? You were...

266
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,060
..teaching PE in some god-awful school, weren't you?

267
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,820
Supply, yeah. I jacked it in, though.

268
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,860
Kids can be cruel little fuckers.

269
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,300
I was. I was a total bitch.

270
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,740
Calmed down a lot now.

271
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,820
Are you actually pedalling, or...?

272
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,100
I'm doing it!

273
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,420
What are you up to now?

274
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,180
Oh, this and that, y'know. Tell him!

275
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,540
Don't be embarrassed.

276
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,780
Well...

277
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,980
..I'm a children's author.

278
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,580
Really? Congratulations! Are you published?

279
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,680
No, not yet, no. Er, still at the development stage,

280
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,420
y'know, mapping out the structure, an' that.

281
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,180
Tell him your idea. It's brilliant.

282
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,380
No!

283
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,700
Go on, have confidence in it.

284
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,540
All right, well, basically, it's like a hardback book,

285
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,020
and on the first page there'll be a picture of a ball

286
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,740
and on the opposite page the word "ball".

287
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,380
So, you turn the page, and there'll be

288
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,540
a picture of a boy and on the opposite page the word...

289
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,020
-"Boy." -Have I told you about it already?

290
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,380
No. Carry on.

291
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,100
So on the next page there'll be a boy and a ball, and it'd say

292
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,040
something like, "Boy got ball,"

293
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,780
or, "Boy play with ball."

294
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,500
I haven't really worked it all out yet.

295
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,340
So it's like baby's first words.

296
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,980
Yeah, but with a story gradually developing out of it.

297
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,180
I've read it twice. Made me cry.

298
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,780
Sorry, Darren, this isn't an authored book,

299
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,060
is it? It's just words and pictures.

300
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,260
Well, like I say, it's early days.

301
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,620
I think people will buy it.

302
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,730
They are buying it!

303
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,980
It already exists.

304
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,720
It's hardly going to make you into the next JK Rowling, is it?

305
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,900
All right, Callum,

306
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,860
you don't have to shoot it down in flames.

307
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,460
We can't all be elbow-deep in fannies every day.

308
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,060
Can we not talk like that, please?

309
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,460
I could be where you are now, top of me tree, on a good wage,

310
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,740
but I never had the chance, did I? If I'd have graduated,

311
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,500
I could've made something of meself.

312
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,900
-Could've been a contender? -Yes!

313
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,340
Yeah. In sports science?

314
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,860
-Give me a break! -Leave it, Callum!

315
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,300
You can't possibly compare

316
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,500
me doing seven years of medical training

317
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,970
to you playing rounders and learning about Lucozade.

318
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,940
I was good at it.

319
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,400
Really?

320
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:03,820
Yes.

321
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
So why did you drop out, then?

322
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,660
I'll drop you out in a minute!

323
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,740
That's enough!

324
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,260
I didn't invite you both here today

325
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,020
just so you could open up old wounds.

326
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,140
I wanted it to be a celebration of...who we used to be.

327
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,020
As opposed to who we are?

328
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,880
Uni was 30 years ago,

329
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,460
Laurence. Move on!

330
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,040
Sorry, I think something's happened.

331
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,320
Why's it not going?

332
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,020
What?

333
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,420
Pedals are stuck.

334
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,860
Er... All right, try going backward.

335
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,740
We're tangled up in all these weeds, look.

336
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,600
They're everywhere.

337
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,820
Oh, for Christ's sake! This is all your fault!

338
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,260
Why didn't you look where we were going?

339
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,740
What do you mean, look where I was going?

340
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,020
We're on an empty lake, mate!

341
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,740
Yes, which makes it even more idiotic!

342
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,500
Don't blame her, Laurence. It was an accident.

343
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,780
Keep waggling the pedals.

344
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,680
She wasn't even meant to be here!

345
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,440
Er, excuse me,

346
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,300
I was invited to this party by Darren.

347
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,560
For God's sake, there is no party!

348
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,040
Larry!

349
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,340
This was supposed to be a reunion of three friends

350
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,380
from university. I wanted everything to be perfect.

351
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,140
You've managed to ruin it!

352
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,580
Darren, is that true?

353
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,140
I cocked up, didn't I?

354
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,500
I didn't read the invite properly. This is it.

355
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,780
This...is the party.

356
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,460
So, what, Judge Rinder's not even coming?

357
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,220
Doubtful.

358
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,980
I'm missing Gemma's hen night for this?

359
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,380
They'll have a stripper

360
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,300
helicoptering all over them now in Sugar Hut

361
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,180
while we're playing Swallows And fucking Amazons.

362
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,940
Soz, babe. I'll make it up to you.

363
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,020
Oh, shove it up your arse!

364
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,140
So, I think that's everyone fallen out with everyone.

365
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,180
Reunion 101.

366
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,620
What are we going to do now?

367
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,660
Row, row, row your boat

368
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,820
Gently down the stream

369
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

370
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,460
Life is but a dream

371
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,780
Row, row, row your boat

372
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,860
Gently to the shore

373
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,980
If you see a lion there

374
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,300
Don't forget to roar... Roarrrr!

375
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,540
Row, row, row your...

376
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,140
Please stop.

377
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,880
Fine.

378
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,920
So, what are you going to do?

379
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,380
Just sit here and wait for someone to find us?

380
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,040
Is that your plan?

381
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,600
Yes.

382
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
I told you, I saw someone earlier over there.

383
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,540
Probably a fisherman.

384
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,900
Well, it's going to be dark in half an hour.

385
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,260
That's all I'm saying.

386
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,860
Can't one of us go under and untangle the pedals?

387
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,020
Not recommended.

388
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,420
The water's freezing.

389
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,060
You'd have hypothermia within 20 minutes.

390
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,180
Right, well, I'm sorry,

391
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,980
but you're all going to need to look over there.

392
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,540
Why? Have you seen someone?

393
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,380
No, because I need to do a wee.

394
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,660
Oh, no, are you serious?

395
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,620
Yes! I've been busting for ages.

396
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,820
It's all the tinkling of the water.

397
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,470
Well, talk amongst yourselves.

398
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,820
I don't want you listening to it.

399
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,660
Good idea, actually. Might kill off some of the weeds.

400
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,820
It's not acid!

401
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,040
Oh! Bonus ball.

402
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,460
I like her.

403
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,700
This is the story of my life.

404
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,260
What, listening to a woman pissing off a paedo?

405
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,300
Pedalo. No, being stuck.

406
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,180
When we graduated, I stayed in the area, married Bonnie,

407
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,220
did a PGCE.

408
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,500
Next thing, I'm back teaching the same course I just graduated from.

409
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,940
You've all moved on and had lives.

410
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,740
I'm still living in 1989.

411
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,980
I wouldn't worry about it, Larry. You've not missed much.

412
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,980
Although Game Of Thrones was pretty good.

413
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Even then, they ruined the ending.

414
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,700
Well, I'm not going to do that.

415
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,220
All right, I'm done.

416
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,020
You can turn round now.

417
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,620
Do you think that's why they say, "Relieve yourself,"

418
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,580
'cause you're relieved you've not pissed your pants?

419
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,100
Oh, come on! This is ridiculous!

420
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,820
I thought you said Bonnie was going to be here.

421
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,260
-She is. -Well, call her.

422
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,780
-Tell her to come early. -There's no signal.

423
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,540
Well, can't we all just check again?

424
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,020
Yeah, I'm sure I had a couple of bars earlier.

425
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,380
Is she still on the same number?

426
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,190
What network are you on?

427
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,100
Give us your phone, Larry.

428
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,970
-No. -Give it to him!

429
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,780
There's no point.

430
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,600
Why not?!

431
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,880
Because Bonnie's dead!

432
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,180
What?

433
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,860
She's dead. She died.

434
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,660
A year ago.

435
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,100
It was a short illness.

436
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,860
And she was very brave.

437
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,500
She's in here.

438
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,700
Sorry, is...?

439
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,060
Is Bonnie a...guinea pig?

440
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,060
No.

441
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,820
She was my wife.

442
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,940
I just got confused cos of him and his...dog daughters.

443
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,300
I'm really sorry, mate.

444
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,060
Why didn't you tell us?

445
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,620
I wanted to.

446
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,140
I didn't know how.

447
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,660
I wanted to see you face-to-face.

448
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
It's not the sort of thing you can say in an email

449
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,220
or round-robin.

450
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,500
A week went by, and then a month, and then, in the end...

451
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,920
That's why I...I wanted...

452
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,500
to have you both here today,

453
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,180
one year on.

454
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,500
You were there when we met,

455
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
you were there when we married.

456
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,660
I wanted you to be there for the final goodbye....

457
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,660
..because even though I know that we don't see each other any more...

458
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,900
..you're still my best friends.

459
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,060
So you wanted us to be here to scatter her ashes?

460
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,180
Yeah.

461
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,180
Sort of.

462
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,660
Oh, my God!

463
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,980
Jesus, Laurence!

464
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,180
Where's he gone?

465
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,300
Laurence, come back, man! You'll freeze to death!

466
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,660
Laurence!

467
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,180
Can you still see him?

468
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,300
Yeah, I think so.

469
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,500
What's he playing at?

470
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,620
He always talked about how he proposed to Bonnie on an island.

471
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,020
I thought he meant the Caribbean or somewhere, but...

472
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,700
..it must be that one there.

473
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,340
I can't believe she died and he never told you.

474
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,460
I suppose that's what all those LinkedIn requests were.

475
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,620
I feel terrible now.

476
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,780
I bet you do! Poor man.

477
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,940
I nearly cried when he said you two were his best friends.

478
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,340
We were.

479
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,580
Used to be.

480
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,860
But...

481
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,940
..life moves on, doesn't it?

482
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,140
Not for Bonnie.

483
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,220
Maybe I have become too self-absorbed.

484
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,220
But we're all dealing with our own shit, aren't we?

485
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,140
Yours is mostly dog shit, by the sound of it.

486
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
His wife's died.

487
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,420
You can't just scoop that up in a little blue bag

488
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,660
and hang it off a tree.

489
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,040
I once did one in a paintpot

490
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,160
and left it in the cellar.

491
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,020
I was moving house, so it didn't really matter.

492
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
If it's any consolation,

493
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,440
I absolutely hate my job.

494
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,060
I spent years trying to get to the top,

495
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,540
and now I'm there, I realise

496
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,580
it was just the endeavour that was keeping me going.

497
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,300
I got to the end of the rainbow and found the pot of gold.

498
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,060
Now I'd give you anything to give it back and start again.

499
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,660
Like you. I envy you.

500
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,740
Well, it was not a choice.

501
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,380
What do you mean?

502
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,540
I didn't drop out of uni.

503
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,780
I got kicked out.

504
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,180
Really? Yeah.

505
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,330
I'd done so well to get me A levels,

506
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,340
but...uni was just so hard!

507
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,420
Even if it was only sports science.

508
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,420
Then one day, I realised,

509
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,260
if life gives you melons...

510
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,580
..you're probably dyslexic.

511
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,620
What?

512
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,740
I've got surface dyslexia.

513
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,220
I was too embarrassed to say anything at the time.

514
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,900
But that's why this book is so important to me.

515
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,100
It's not for babies.

516
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,220
It's for kids and adults...

517
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,340
..like me.

518
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,380
Have I got to think of something bad that's happened to me now?

519
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,340
Cos nothing really has.

520
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,460
I've had a great life- good mates,

521
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,860
loving family,

522
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,820
nice little job...

523
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,820
By the sound of it, it's cos I never went to fucking university.

524
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,140
Well...er...

525
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,700
..this is it.

526
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,140
Er, it's not...gone quite according to plan.

527
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,460
Er, Darren...

528
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,580
..he brought an uninvited guest...

529
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,360
..which really irritated me, of course.

530
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,440
But, er, if you'd have been here,

531
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,360
you'd have welcomed her with open arms

532
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,380
and said, "The more the merrier,"

533
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,020
'cause that's the kind of person that you were...

534
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,780
..and why I have... found it so hard...

535
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,300
..to live without you.

536
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,100
Anyway, I, erm...

537
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:22,420
I didn't want to just scatter your ashes in the normal way, so, er...

538
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,660
..I hope you approve.

539
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,700
Hang on. What's this?

540
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,540
"Ashes To Flashes Memorial Fireworks"?

541
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,660
So she's...

542
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,620
I promised you a party, didn't I?

543
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,900
Now I AM going to cry!

544
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,620
Burn bright, Bonnie.

545
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,860
Burn bright.

546
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,220
Right, one of us needs to swim over and make sure he's all right.

547
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,500
Not a good idea, Darren.

548
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,180
Well, maybe we can get a signal over there!

549
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,980
The water's too cold. You'll freeze your bollocks off.

550
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,300
Well, do another wee in it, then!

551
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,860
Sit down, Darren. Don't be so stupid.

552
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,220
Don't call me stupid, all right?!

553
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,740
-Stop it, you two! -Stop it! I'm going over there!

554
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,900
-Get off! -Stop it!

555
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,060
Excuse me...

556
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,860
..do you know what happened to my friends?

557
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,540
They got stuck in the weeds.

558
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,780
Were they rescued?

559
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,860
Please, we have to do something.

560
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,940
There were three of them.

561
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,940
Don't worry about them.

562
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,740
They're fine.

563
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,140
Where are they?

564
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,940
On the other side.

565
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,820
Thank God.

566
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,380
Did they tell you where to find me?

567
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,340
I knew where to find you.

568
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,340
I've been watching you for some time.

569
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,900
Thank you.

570
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,100
Really sorry. I...

571
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,580
Laurence...
