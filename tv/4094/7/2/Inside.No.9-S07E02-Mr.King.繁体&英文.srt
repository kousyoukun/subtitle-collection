00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,520
這是你們的新老師 柯蒂斯老師
Dyma'ch athro newydd Mr Curtis

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,400
他會教你們英語
ac mae'n mynd I'ch dysgu chi yn Saesneg.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,720
我跟他們說
I was telling them

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,960
你所有的課都會用英語上
you're going to be taking all your lessons in English,

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,040
英語對于將來想離開村子
which is a very important skill

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,880
外出探險的人來說
for those adventurers amongst you

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,080
是個非常重要的技能
who might be thinking about leaving the village in the future.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,640
柯蒂斯老師曾在倫敦的一所學校教書
Mr Curtis used to teach at a school in London

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,280
所以我相信他有許多激動人心的故事
so I'm sure he'll have all sorts of exciting stories

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,160
會講給我們聽的
to tell us.

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,640
倫敦人會花兩英鎊買杯咖啡 是嗎
They pay £2 for a coffee, don't they?

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,840
還有別的
And the rest.

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,480
我的天啊 好家伙
Oh, dearie me, imagine that!

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,580
大家都知道
Now, as you all know,

24
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,600
你們的金老師在經過美好的一年后
your previous teacher, Mr King, had to leave us

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,120
不得不離開我們了
after a wonderful year.

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,240
我知道 我知道
I know, I know.

27
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,840
不過他在旅途中
But he has sent us this postcard from his travels,

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,680
給我們寄來了這張明信片
and I wondered if one of you

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,720
你們誰來給全班同學念一下
would like to read it to the class.

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,500
-我 -我
-Me! -Me.

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,560
凱莉 你要不要來念一下
Ceri, would you care to do the honours?

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,580
好孩子
Good girl.

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,560
親愛的九班 我在澳洲問候大家
"Dear Class 9, greetings from down under.

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,200
我在這里過得很好
"I'm having an amazing time

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,760
我想新學期也該開始了吧
"and I'm thinking of you, as you start your next chapter.

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,920
我非常懷念和你們在一起的時光
"I cherish the memory of our time together

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,280
能夠真正地了解你們每個人
"and getting to know all of you so closely.

38
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,080
愛你們的金老師
"Much love, Mr King."

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,160
多好的人
What a man!

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,880
多好的老師 太好了
What a teacher, what a man.

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,800
那么 該上課了
Anyway, back down to reality.

42
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,800
柯蒂斯老師 交給你了
Mr Curtis, over to you.

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,680
謝謝你 校長
Thank you, Headmaster.

44
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,800
那么 我有個問題
So, here's a question

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,960
我和皮諾曹有什么不同呢
what's the difference between me and Pinocchio?

46
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,800
我很開心能來威爾士
I'm glad to be in Wales.

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,600
啊 因為皮諾曹被鯨魚吃掉了
Ah, now that is because Pinocchio was eaten by a whale.

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
我說得對嗎 柯蒂斯老師
Have I got that right, Mr Curtis?

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,080
對 我只是開了個玩笑
Yes, it was just a joke.

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,840
這就是個玩笑 九班的同學們
It was a joke, Class 9.

51
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,680
是個玩笑
A joke.

52
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,960
繼續上課
Carry on.

53
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,440
大家都知道
So, as you all know,

54
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,080
期末演出的主題都是跟環境有關的
our end-of-term assembly is going to be all about the environment.

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,560
那么 環境是什么意思呢
So, what does that mean?

56
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,680
誰來說一下
Anyone.

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,600
-尤恩 -呃
-Euan? -Erm...

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,640
是我們教室
Our classroom?

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,840
對 教室是我們最熟悉的環境 還有呢
Yes, that's our immediate surroundings, what else?

60
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,720
還有田野
Ooh, fields!

61
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,560
對 很好 環境包括了 人類或動植物
Yes, good. It's any place where people and plants

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,800
生活和生長的所有地方
and animals actually live and grow.

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,280
那么哪些事情會影響我們的環境呢
So what types of things will affect our environment?

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,400
哦 人豆 老師
Oh, human beans, sir.

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,440
你說什么 格溫
What's that, Gwen?

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,840
人豆
Human beans.

67
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,080
不是人豆 我們不是蔬菜
Not human beans, we're not vegetables,

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
是人類 對
but human beings, yes,

69
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,960
我們人類確實對環境有影響
we certainly have an impact.

70
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,520
我們對環境的影響有正面的
And we can affect our environment

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,120
也有負面的
in positive ways and in negative ways.

72
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,680
那么 哪些正面的事情是可以做的呢
So, what are some of the positive things that we can do?

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,800
凱莉
Ceri?

74
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,640
回收利用
Recycling.

75
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,760
非常好 凱莉 回收利用
Very good, Ceri. Yes. Recycling.

76
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,920
還有別的嗎
Anyone else?

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,540
你們聽說過格蕾塔·桑伯格這個人嗎
Well, who here has heard of Greta Thunberg?

78
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,920
都沒聽說過嗎
None of you?

79
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,160
好吧
OK. Er...

80
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,680
你們應該都聽說過全球變暖吧
You've probably all heard of global warming?

81
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,680
沒聽說過 那么氣候變化呢
No? How about climate change?

82
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,360
好吧 你們去年應該看過一些這方面的報道
OK, well, you should have covered some of this last year,

83
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,830
我來問問大家
but let me ask you this...

84
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,000
你們說颶風是什么原因造成的
What do you think causes hurricanes?

85
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,280
上帝放的屁
God farting!

86
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,360
不對 別胡說 歐文
No, don't be silly, Owen.

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,480
這是個很嚴肅的話題
This is actually a really serious subject.

88
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,080
作為你們的家庭作業 我希望你們放學后
So, for your homework, I want you all to go home

89
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,200
學習一下有關全球變暖和臭氧層的知識
and learn all about global warming and the ozone layer.

90
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,360
老師 金老師說我們不用做家庭作業的
Sir, Mr King said we didn't have to do homework.

91
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,520
很遺憾
Well, I'm really sorry,

92
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,880
不過金老師不再是你的老師了 我才是
but Mr King isn't your teacher now, I am.

93
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,560
你們或許還沒有意識到
You know, I don't know if you realise it,

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,200
這會是影響你們和你們未來的
but this is the number one topic

95
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,480
最重要的話題之一
that's going to affect you and all your futures,

96
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,620
所以你們對此一無所知是不行的
so it really isn't something that you can afford to be ignorant about!

97
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,820
抱歉
Sorry.

98
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,600
好了 大家回去寫一篇小作文
Now, I want you all to do a paragraph

99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,960
下周一交上來
and bring it in on Monday.

100
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,560
好了 現在把課本拿出來
Right, you can all get your books out

101
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,440
默讀20分鐘 開始
and do silent reading for 20 minutes. Off you go.

102
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,320
校長
Oh, Headmaster?

103
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,040
我能跟您說句話嗎
Er, could I have a word?

104
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,160
可以啊 艾倫 有什么事嗎
Of course, Alan. How can I help?

105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,240
您有金老師的電子郵箱嗎
I wondered if you had an email address for Mr King.

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,760
電子郵箱
Email...

107
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,880
是那個帶藍色小鳥的圖標嗎
Is that the one with the little blue bird?

108
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,320
不對 那個應該是推特
No, I think that's Twitter.

109
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,240
對 你說得對
That's right, yes, tash-tag.

110
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,760
電子郵箱應該是帶@的那個吧
Email is the @ sign,

111
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,360
我記得我辦公室里
isn't it? Yes, I think I've got

112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,080
有張紙上寫的就是這個
a piece of paper with that on in my office.

113
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,360
哦 謝謝 我想和他聊聊他
Oh, thanks, it's just I'd love to talk to him

114
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,960
去年教的內容和用的是什么教程
about what he covered last year and what curriculum he's been using.

115
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,000
嗯 沒問題
Well, no problem.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,040
我讓梅根找出來 回頭再給你
I'll ask Megan to dig it out and I'll get back to you.

117
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,360
謝謝
Thanks.

118
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,120
其他的都進展順利嗎
All good otherwise?

119
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,080
對 是的
Er, yeah, I think so.

120
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,960
你期末演出的節目開始排練了嗎
Have you started rehearsing for your assembly yet?

121
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,760
金老師的節目一向是很華麗的
Mr King's were always very lavish.

122
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,160
就像是倫敦西區的戲劇作品一樣
Like West End theatre productions!

123
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,780
我會 我會弄得超好看的
Well, I'll... I'll try and make mine Wicked.

124
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,640
是部音樂劇
That's a musical. Ah.

125
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,920
你又說笑話了
Another one of your jokes.

126
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,560
那我就等著看了
Well, I look forward to it.

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,280
看到孩子們站在舞臺上 是件賞心悅目的事情
Always a joy to see the children take centre stage.

128
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,680
艾倫 你也知道這是一所很小的學校
We're a small school, Alan, as you can see,

129
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,760
我們已經有好幾次差點關門了
and we've very nearly been closed down a few times,

130
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,560
不過能把你這樣的
but bringing in teachers such as yourself,

131
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,480
經歷豐富的老師招進來
with all your experience of the world,

132
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,760
確實有助于孩子們成長 你明白嗎
it really helps the children grow, you know?

133
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,320
嗯 我也是這么希望的 校長 真的
Well, that's... That's all I want, Headmaster, it really is.

134
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,880
那就好 行吧 我回頭把電子郵箱找出來
Jolly good. Right, well, I'll get that bmail for you,

135
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,240
讓梅根發短信給你
and I'll get Megan to send it to you as a text.

136
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,360
做出英國教育的標準吧
Take that, Ofsted!

137
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,440
-非常好 你畫的是個南瓜嗎 很好 -對
-That's very good. Is that going to be a pumpkin? Great. -Yes.

138
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,120
上面還有嚇人的眼睛
With some scary eyes on it.

139
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,500
掛起來的時候
Make sure that your paint isn't dripping

140
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,440
可別讓油彩滴下來
when you hang up your paintings, OK?

141
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,160
-歐文 你的畫還沒干嗎 -呃 是啊老師
-Is yours still wet, Owen? -Er, yes, sir.

142
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,520
那先把它放在托盤上
Well, put it on top of the tray for now.

143
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,800
畫得非常好 等畫干了以后
That's fantastic. And then, when it is dry,

144
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,720
我們再把這些都掛起來展覽
we will stick them all up on the display.

145
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,080
哦 謝謝你 凱莉 太好了
Oh, thank you, Ceri, that's great.

146
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,520
好了 休息15分鐘 脫了圍裙 去玩一會兒吧
OK, you've got 15 minutes. Aprons off, go and have a play.

147
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,840
走吧 去玩吧 去吧
Walking. That's it, off you go.

148
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,360
凱莉 我有話要問你
Ceri, could I have a word with you, please?

149
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,160
我說 你想什么呢
I mean, what were you thinking? Hmm?

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
這些蝌蚪現在變不成青蛙了 對吧
Those tadpoles are not going to turn into frogs now, are they?

151
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,000
為什么不行
Why not?

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,640
你把它們放在壺里煮了呀
Because you boiled them in the kettle.

153
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,120
你為什么這么干 凱莉
I mean, why would you do that, Ceri?

154
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,640
因為全球變暖了
Global warming.

155
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,800
我是讓你去研究 沒讓你實踐
I asked you to research it, not recreate it.

156
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,320
金老師還吃過金魚呢
Mr King once ate a goldfish.

157
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,880
是嗎 我不管金老師干過什么
Yeah, well, I don't care what Mr King did.

158
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,600
我有些擔心你了 凱莉
I'm getting a bit concerned about you, Ceri.

159
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,640
上個禮拜你把西蒙的臉
I mean, last week,

160
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,160
按進他的生日蛋糕里了 對吧
you pushed Simon's face into his birthday cake, didn't you?

161
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
他的頭發要是被蠟燭點著了怎么辦
What if his hair had caught fire on the candles?

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,440
你看過邁克爾·杰克遜的視頻嗎
Have you seen that Michael Jackson video?

163
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,880
不是舔人屁股的那個
Not the one about licking boys' bottoms,

164
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,480
是他的頭發著火的那個視頻
the one where his hair caught fire.

165
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,040
他險些就毀容了
It very nearly disfigured him...

166
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,720
甚至更嚴重
..even more.

167
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,280
邁克爾·杰克遜是誰
Who's Michael Jackson?

168
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,000
算了
Never mind.

169
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,720
你家里怎么樣 有什么想跟我說的嗎
Is there anything going on at home that you want to tell me about?

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,680
-我家的房子在擴建呢 -哦
-We're having an extension. -OK.

171
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,440
你爸爸媽媽相處融洽嗎 沒有吵架吧
Are Mummy and Daddy getting on all right? No shouting?

172
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,600
有讓你煩心的事嗎
Something upsetting you?

173
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,400
我不想看到世界末日
I don't want the world to end.

174
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,640
那肯定不會
Well, it's not going to end.

175
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,840
-誰跟你說會世界末日的 -反抗滅絕組織
-Who said it's going to end? -The stinking rebellion.

176
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,480
什么組織
Who?

177
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,720
是你讓我們看的 還是家庭作業
You asked us to read about it for homework.

178
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,440
你是說氣候變化的抗議者嗎
You mean the climate change protesters?

179
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,840
嚇到我了
It frightened me.

180
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
千萬別害怕 凱莉
Oh, you mustn't be frightened, Ceri.

181
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,720
我的意思是 你應該感受那種情緒
I mean, you should feel

182
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
然后用它做一些有意義的事情
that emotion and then do something positive with it.

183
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,400
沒關系的
It's all right.

184
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,080
好了 好了 對不起 嚇到你了
There, there. Sorry it frightened you.

185
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,880
想去外面玩一會兒嗎
Now, do you want to go and play outside or...

186
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,680
還是和我說說話
..or do you want to stay inside with me?

187
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
我們說說話吧
Stay with you.

188
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,800
好孩子
Good girl.

189
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,800
好孩子
Good girl.

190
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,080
你是餓了嗎
Little bit peckish, are we?

191
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,680
哦 抱歉 校長
Oh, sorry, Headmaster,

192
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,880
我就是
I was just, erm,

193
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,800
在練給孩子們表演的小魔術
just practising a trick for the children.

194
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,880
這倒是教食物鏈知識的一個辦法
Well, that's one way of teaching the food chain.

195
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,760
艾倫 方便的話 我有幾句話想單獨和你談談
I... I just wanted to have a quiet word with you, Alan,

196
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,280
-行嗎 -當然可以
-if you don't mind. -Yes, of course.

197
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,840
你來面試的時候
When you came in for your interview,

198
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,320
你說你很想來我們這種
you said you were keen to move to a smaller school,

199
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,400
規模比較小的學校任教
like ours, away from the cut and thrust,

200
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,120
遠離俗世的紛紛擾擾
shall we say, of inner-city education

201
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,440
享受更寧靜的生活方式
and embrace a quieter pace of life.

202
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,400
對 這也是醫生給我的建議
Yes, it's, erm, literally what the doctor ordered.

203
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,840
我知道在涉及心理健康的問題上
Now, I know it's important we talk sensitively

204
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,000
應該謹慎
about mental health,

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,280
不過我還是想跟你明確一下
so I just wanted to clarify...

206
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,340
你有些精神上的問題 是嗎
You went a bit doolally, didn't you?

207
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
是 是
No. No, I...

208
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,720
是因為工作量大了些
It was just the workload.

209
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,200
我有些疲憊 身心俱疲
I was exhausted, both physically, mentally.

210
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,080
我有一段時間確實迷失了自我
I did lose myself for a time,

211
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,880
不過 來到這里對我非常有好處
but, erm, coming here's done me the world of good.

212
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
您為什么這么問
Why do you ask?

213
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,920
是這樣
Well, the thing is...

214
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,480
有人舉報了你
..an allegation has been made against you,

215
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,360
我就有責任展開調查了
and it's my duty to investigate it.

216
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,080
-什么舉報 -我暫時不能說
-What allegation?  -I can't divulge that at the moment.

217
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,040
-那 是誰舉報的我 -她也不想暴露身份
-Well, who's made it? -She doesn't want to say.

218
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,000
-是個女學生嗎 -也許是也許不是
-So it's a girl?  -She may or may not be.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,840
關鍵是我向凱莉的父母保證過
The point is I promised Ceri's parents

220
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,880
舉報者的身份要絕對保密
that she, or he, would have absolute anonymity.

221
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,720
-所以是凱莉 對嗎 -是的
-So it's Ceri?  -Yes.

222
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,040
好吧
Right.

223
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,960
既然你已經了解到了一部分情況
So now you've wormed that out of me, can you tell me

224
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,080
你有什么要說的嗎
in your own words

225
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,720
周二上午課間休息時發生了什么
what happened Tuesday morning, break time?

226
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,560
-什么叫發生了什么 -什么也沒發生啊
-What do you mean, what happened? -Nothing happened.

227
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,240
她的行為有些古怪
She'd been behaving strangely for a while.

228
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,120
她把蝌蚪都弄死了
She killed all the tadpoles.

229
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,680
我把她留下想跟她談談而已
I kept her behind to talk to her about it.

230
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,760
你沒有讓她做什么
And at no point did you ask her

231
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,160
犯忌諱的事情嗎
if she wanted to play the hairy meat whistle?

232
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,240
什么 沒有
What? No.

233
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
你沒說過
And you didn't say,

234
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,400
你想看看老師的蝌蚪嗎 這種話
"Do you want to see how sir can make his own tadpoles?"

235
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,760
-當然沒有 這太可怕了 -你確定嗎
-Definitely not, that's horrible. -Are you sure?

236
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,840
確定 說沒說過我記得很清楚
Yes, I think I'd remember saying that.

237
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,120
那你覺得這種話她是從哪兒聽來的
Well, where do you suppose she's got this from, then?

238
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,320
我相信兒童讀物里肯定沒有
Because I don't recall that being in the Biff and Chip books.

239
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,060
我不知道
I don't know.

240
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,670
也許她在網上看了一些不好的內容
Maybe she saw something inappropriate online,

241
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,600
這也是常有的事
it happens all the time.

242
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,920
可我們這里沒有無線網絡
Not with our Wi-Fi connection, it doesn't.

243
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,200
我下載《鄉村檔案》都用了一個周末
It takes me all weekend to download one Countryfile.

244
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,040
你和她提過邁克爾·杰克遜對男的
Did you talk to her about Michael Jackson doing things

245
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,280
菊花所做之事嗎
with boys' anuses?

246
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,720
提到過 可沒提其他的事
Yes, but I never said anuses.

247
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,040
這就夠了
Well, that's something.

248
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,800
我已經說服了凱莉的父母
Now, I've talked the girl's parents down

249
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,520
不要提出正式起訴
from making an official complaint,

250
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,080
如果可以的話
but I don't want to drag the police into it

251
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,240
我也不想把警察牽扯進來
if I can help it.

252
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,760
我們是一所獨立學校
We're an independent school and we like to deal

253
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,880
我們喜歡在內部處理這類事情
with these types of things within the community.

254
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,400
什么 以前發生過這種事嗎
What, so this has happened before?

255
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,920
你初來乍到 我不會開玩笑的
You're new here, and I'm not being funny,

256
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,480
可我不能僅憑你說的就相信你 艾倫
but I don't know you from Alan.

257
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,640
-是亞當 -哦 抱歉 我以為是艾倫呢
-It's Adam. -Oh, sorry, I thought it was Alan.

258
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,200
亞當 我相信你能理解 作為這所學校的校長
I'm sure you understand, Adam, that, as head of this school,

259
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,960
我必須首先確定事實真相
I have to establish the facts of this matter

260
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,040
然后才能把凱莉交回到你手上
before I can allow Ceri back into your clutches, so to speak.

261
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,120
對 沒錯 您需要我寫一份聲明嗎
Yes, of course. You want me to make a statement?

262
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,320
不用 不過我需要你給我看你的雞巴
No, I want you to show me your penis.

263
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,520
什么
What?

264
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,840
凱莉描述得非常細致
The girl has given quite a vivid description

265
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,200
她還用橡皮泥捏了個模型
and I believe made a Plasticine model,

266
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,840
可是我不想碰
but I didn't want to touch it.

267
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,120
我要看看她捏的和你的是不是一樣
I need to see if this tallies with the real thing.

268
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,440
所以還得弄個辨認隊列嗎 如果不是我的
So I've got to do an identity parade? What if it's not mine?

269
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,800
你還要像尋找灰姑娘那樣四處去尋找嗎
Are you going to take it around the kingdom like Cinderella?

270
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,200
別耍小聰明 亞當
Don't be facetious, Adam,

271
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,880
我是在想辦法了解事實真相
I'm trying to get to the bottom of this, one way or the other.

272
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,560
要么是你說謊 要么是凱莉在說謊
Either you're lying or the girl's lying.

273
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,160
這怎么可能
I just can't believe this.

274
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,440
我可以隨時聯系你的工會代表
I can always contact your union representative...

275
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,800
不
No...

276
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,960
不
No.

277
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,720
算了 快點看 行了吧
Well, just make it quick, all right?

278
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,960
這多干凈利落 這樣你我都省事
All very neat and tidy, that's what I like to see.

279
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,000
你究竟在找什么
What are you looking for, exactly?

280
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,160
啊 這下就明白了
Ah, now that would be telling.

281
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,760
俗話說
They say...

282
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,320
世上沒有一模一樣的兩片雪花
..they're like snowflakes no two are alike.

283
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,120
太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

284
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,800
抱歉 溫妮 我們這兒正忙著呢
Oh, sorry, Winnie, we're a bit busy here.

285
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,560
你好 柯蒂斯老師 你還沒走啊
Hello, Mr Curtis, you're here late.

286
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
我現在可以打掃了嗎
Is it all right for me to clean now?

287
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,360
現在不方便
Not just at the moment.

288
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,720
哦 別擔心溫妮 她什么都看不見
Oh, don't worry about Winnie, she's blind as a bat.

289
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
沒事的 溫妮 你忙你的
It's fine, Winnie, you go right ahead.

290
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,360
是你嗎 愛德華茲校長
Is that you, Mr Edwards?

291
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,000
原來你也在啊 你還在忙嗎
I didn't see you down there. You keeping busy?

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,440
是啊 我一向都很忙的
Yes, I've got my hands full, as usual.

293
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,520
沒關系 我能把你身邊打掃干凈的
Don't worry, I can clean around you.

294
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,480
我得省出時間來清理男生的廁所
I have to save some time to tackle the boys' toilets.

295
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,640
他們拉的粑粑實在是
The size of some of those stools...

296
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,720
真不知道他們在家里都吃了什么
I don't know what their mothers feed them.

297
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,440
實在是太難清理了
Like airport Toblerones, some of them.

298
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,860
可以了嗎
Are you all done here?

299
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,480
可以了 是的
I think so, yes.

300
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,320
等我調查清楚這件事 我會再來找你的
I'll be in touch once I've got my head around this.

301
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,200
謝謝你 亞當
Thank you, Adam.

302
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,900
我們就是 討論一下新的繪畫創作
We were just, erm, discussing a possible arts project.

303
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,880
哦 我還以為他在給你的雞巴拍照呢
Oh, I thought he was taking photographs of your cock.

304
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,520
好了 九班 我發的是關于分數的卷子
OK, Class 9, I'm handing out these worksheets on fractions.

305
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,920
給你們15分鐘
You have got 15 minutes.

306
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,400
能做多少做多少
Do as many as you can.

307
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,080
記得把名字寫在最上面
Remember to put your names at the top, please.

308
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,600
老師 凱莉怎么了
Sir, what happened to Ceri?

309
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
你想問什么
What do you mean?

310
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,080
-她去哪兒了 -我不知道
-Where is she?  -I don't know.

311
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,870
別說話了 歐文
Now tight lips, please, Owen.

312
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,160
聽我說 現在不是你說話的時候
We listen with these, not these.

313
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,940
安靜
Quiet.

314
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,020
沒聽見嗎 安靜
I said, quiet!

315
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,240
那是什么
What have you got there?

316
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,960
歐文 什么東西
Owen, what is that?

317
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,520
-沒什么 老師 -當我是白癡嗎 拿出來
-Nothing, sir!  -I'm not an idiot, show me.

318
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,320
在誰手里
All right, who's got it?

319
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,920
拿出來 給我交出來 快點兒
Give it to me. Give it to me now.

320
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,420
這是什么 格溫
What's this? Gwen?

321
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,760
格溫
Gwen?

322
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,120
是胡蘿卜 老師
Carrot, sir.

323
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,240
胡蘿卜
A carrot?

324
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,800
那你笑什么
Well, why are you laughing, then?

325
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,280
是不是因為這像個雞巴
Is it because this bit looks like a penis?

326
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
又大又軟的雞巴
A big floppy penis?!

327
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,000
怎么了 柯蒂斯老師
Everything all right, Mr Curtis?

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,640
啊 我們在教分數 還有生物
Yes, we were just doing fractions and...biology.

329
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,040
兩門課一起上 有意思
Interesting combination.

330
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,280
我把凱莉·摩根給你帶來了
I have young Ceri Morgan for you.

331
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,160
去坐下吧 凱莉
Ceri, would you like to take a seat? Good girl.

332
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,240
這下沒事了吧 校長
Everything, er, all right now, Headmaster?

333
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,240
沒事了沒事了 都解決了 沒什么麻煩了
Yes, yes, all cleared up, no further action required.

334
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,880
可以說這兩張照片
Suffice to say there was quite a big discrepancy

335
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,840
之間的差別很大
between the two images.

336
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,760
為了你好 我必須要確保萬無一失
In your favour, I have to add. So, you know, every cloud...

337
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,600
哦 好吧 謝謝
Oh, well. Good, thanks.

338
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,760
繼續上課吧
As you were.

339
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,680
你能回來就好 凱莉
It's nice to have you back, Ceri.

340
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,720
我說一句
Just to say,

341
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,280
如果想不出答案
if you're struggling to find the right answer...

342
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,840
也不要胡編亂造
..don't just make something up,

343
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,000
因為說謊是有代價的
because that has consequences.

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,440
有問題可以舉手提問
Just put your hand up and talk to me.

345
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,440
如果我不知道發生了什么 我就幫不了你們
I can't help you if I don't know what's going on.

346
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,960
所以不要在我背后說三道四
So don't go behind my back.

347
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,080
明白嗎 那就好
OK? Good.

348
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,400
哦 你好 溫妮
Oh. Hi, Winnie.

349
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,080
哦 你好
Oh, hello, dear.

350
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,380
你要不要些韭菜呢
I just wondered if you wanted to take a leek.

351
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,480
什么
Sorry?

352
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,200
參加豐收節啊
For the harvest festival.

353
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,880
今年我的收成不錯
I've had a good crop this year.

354
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,560
土豆又大又漂亮還有小蘿卜
Nice big potatoes, radishes...

355
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,760
我的大頭菜還得獎了呢
My turnips have won prizes, you know.

356
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,480
哦 那恭喜你了
Well, congratulations.

357
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,540
溫妮
Winnie...

358
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,080
金老師和孩子們相處得好嗎
What was, erm, Mr King like with the children?

359
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,720
哦 上課的時候我不知道
Oh, well, I'm not in the lessons, like.

360
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,400
不過他們好像都挺喜歡他的
They all seemed to love him.

361
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,960
他就像是個大明星
He was a real star!

362
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,200
這個也很棒
Quite a dish, too.

363
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,640
好得有些難以置信了
He sounds too good to be true.

364
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,880
嗯 你的蘿卜還真不錯 溫妮
Well, your, erm, neeps are very impressive, Winnie.

365
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,740
謝謝
Thank you.

366
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,000
這是一款全新的內衣
This is a brand-new Playtex.

367
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,720
塑胸的效果不錯
Lift and separate.

368
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,000
我說的是蔬菜
I, er, meant the vegetables.

369
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,720
哦 那是大自然的魔法
Well, that's Mother Nature working her magic.

370
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,600
溫妮 我答應校長
Winnie, I promised the headmaster

371
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,720
今天下班前會把報告交給他
I'd get those reports to him by the end of the day

372
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,640
可我差點兒就忘了
it's completely slipped my mind.

373
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,400
你有沒有
You don't, erm...You don't happen to have a...

374
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,780
他辦公室的鑰匙
key to his office, do you?

375
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,920
求你了
Please?

376
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,320
哦 我有
Oh, go on, then.

377
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,040
你動作快些就行了
As long as you're quick.

378
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,200
謝謝你 我馬上就還回來
Thank you. I'll be two minutes.

379
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,040
沒有姓金的
No King.

380
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,840
校長嗎 是我 艾倫·柯蒂斯
Headmaster, it's Alan Curtis.

381
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,000
是亞當啊 有什么事嗎
Oh, hello, Adam, what can I do for you?

382
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,440
我有幾件要緊的事要跟你說
I need to talk to you urgently about several things,

383
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
首先就是金老師
firstly about Mr King.

384
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,160
這所學校根本沒有他在這里工作過的任何記錄
This school has no record of him ever having worked here.

385
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,720
你說什么 抱歉 我實在是聽不清楚
What's that? Sorry, it's a very bad line.

386
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,440
金老師怎么了
Something about Mr King?

387
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,160
九班去年的班主任是哈迪老師
The class teacher last year was a Mr Hardy,

388
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,320
根本就是另外一個人
a completely different person.

389
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,200
我不知道這個姓金的怎么會在這里
I don't know what this King has been doing here,

390
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,920
還允許他接觸孩子們
being given access to children, but...

391
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,880
但我認為這里發生過校園暴力事件
..I think there's been abuse going on,

392
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,160
而且被掩蓋了下來 我認為你 愛德華茲校長
it's been covered up, and I think you, Mr Edwards,

393
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,000
也是參與者
are part of it!

394
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,720
我聽不見你說什么 亞當 通話質量太差了
I'm losing you, Adam, it's a terrible connection.

395
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,560
我現在在地里呢 一會兒就回來找你 好吧
I'm just in the field - I'll come and see you shortly, OK?

396
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,640
你跑不掉的 你聽見了嗎
You won't get away with this, do you hear?

397
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,080
哦 九班 你們在干嘛
Oh, Class 9, what's this?

398
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,440
我們想讓你看看我們的節目
We want to show you our assembly.

399
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,080
哦 我今天想安排你們默讀
Oh, well, I was just going to do quiet reading today,

400
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,880
要不明天再說吧
but, erm, maybe tomorrow we could...

401
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,120
求你了 老師
Oh, please, sir,

402
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,480
我們一直在努力學習你教我們的東西
we've been working really hard on what you taught us.

403
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,600
那好吧 來吧
Er... OK, go ahead.

404
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,040
歡迎來看我們的節目
Welcome to our assembly!

405
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,420
我們把自己粘在首相官邸前
We have glued ourselves to the Prime Minister's house

406
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,640
以示對氣候變化的抗議
to protest against climate change.

407
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,200
很好
Ha! Very good.

408
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:04,240
全球變暖是對地球最大的威脅
Global warming is the biggest threat to our planet, planet Earth.

409
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,880
我們能做些什么來阻止它呢
What can we do to stop it?

410
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,360
嘿 說你呢 你在干嘛
Hey, you! What are you doing?

411
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,280
我嗎 沒干嘛呀 不就是個塑料杯嗎
Me? Nothing. It's only plastic.

412
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,880
塑料快讓我窒息了
Plastic is slowly choking me...

413
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
它填滿了我的海洋 殺死了野生動物
..filling my oceans and killing wildlife.

414
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,760
那我該怎么辦
What can I do?

415
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,320
回收啊
Recycling!

416
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,660
接招
Take that.

417
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,720
我們回頭再回收他
We'll recycle him later.

418
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,320
哦 這么做可不行 九班的同學們
Oh, I don't think that's appropriate, Class 9.

419
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,680
你們在這把椅子上抹什么了
What have you done to this chair?

420
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,220
強力膠
Superglue.

421
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,400
你也是抗議的一部分 老師
You're part of the protest too, sir.

422
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,800
這一點也不好笑 凱莉 夠了 可以停了
That isn't funny, Ceri. All right, stop this now.

423
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,000
拯救地球的行動在上千年前就開始了
Saving the planet started thousands of years ago.

424
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,200
最初 地球女神
In the beginning, the Earth Goddess

425
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,560
是通過萬物表達自我的女神
was the one who expressed herself through the many.

426
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,560
她是廣闊的虛空 是萬物之始
She was the great void, the beginning of all things.

427
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,320
所有的靈魂都是 在她神圣的子宮里誕生的
All souls were born from her sacred womb,

428
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,800
在她的軀體所化的地球上 生活一段時間
lived for a span upon her body, the Earth,

429
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,140
死后再回到她的墳墓子宮里
then returned to her tomb-womb at death.

430
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,880
墳墓子宮
Tomb-womb?

431
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,280
抱歉 我想這不是第二階段教育的內容
I'm sorry, I don't think that's key stage 2.

432
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,600
可是金老師說
But Mr King said...

433
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,360
聽著 我不知道金老師是誰
Look, I don't know who this Mr King was

434
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,160
也不知道他教了你們什么 可這不正常 明白嗎
or what he was teaching you, but it's not normal, all right?

435
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,880
我會提交正式投訴
I'm going to make an official complaint.

436
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,000
現在麻煩你們把我從這椅子上放開
Now please get me out of this chair.

437
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,040
在15世紀
In the 15th century,

438
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,760
秘魯的兒童會被獻給神
Peru children were sacrificed to the gods

439
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,620
從而結束自然災害
to try and end natural disasters.

440
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,400
可是到了現代
But in modern times,

441
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,540
我們這些孩子要有自己的方式
we the children are demanding sacrifices of our own.

442
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,920
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

443
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,760
等等 這就是你殺死蝌蚪的原因嗎
Wait, wait, is this why you killed the tadpoles?

444
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,120
-想阻止氣候變化嗎 -別說話了 金老師
-To try and end climate change? -No talking, Mr King.

445
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,840
我們是用耳朵聽 不是用嘴
We listen with these, not these.

446
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
我不是金老師
I'm not Mr King!

447
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
閉嘴 老師
Tight lips, sir.

448
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,560
不 不 不要
No, no, don't...

449
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,000
我們已經了解了可再生能源
We have learned about reusable energy.

450
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,760
我們了解了回收和再生
We have learned about recycling and rebirth.

451
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,640
約翰·巴雷康是第一個回收自我
John Barleycorn was the first man to recycle himself,

452
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,400
來回報地球恩賜的人 請聽他的故事
to replenish the Earth's bounty. This is his story.

453
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,680
三個人從西方走來
# There were three men come out of the west

454
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,000
用他們的財富做一件事
# Their fortunes for to try

455
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,880
他們鄭重起誓
# And these three men made a solemn vow

456
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,240
約翰·巴雷康該死
# John Barleycorn should die... #

457
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,560
這是怎么回事
What on earth is going on here?!

458
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,520
你們想干什么
What do you think you're doing?

459
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
我們在做演出表演 校長
We're doing our assembly, sir.

460
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,520
演出 那是下周的事
Assembly? That's not till next week.

461
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,080
你還好吧 柯蒂斯老師
Are you all right, Mr Curtis?

462
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,480
他們對你做了什么 你的嘴怎么了
What have they done to your mouth?

463
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,560
我們正要講約翰·巴雷康的故事
We were about to tell the story of John Barleycorn.

464
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,520
啊 我最喜歡的故事 接著講
Ah, my favourite part. Carry on.

465
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,680
約翰·巴雷康代表了自然界的生命循環
John Barleycorn represents the life cycle of the field.

466
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,440

He is crowned once a year at the start of the harvest festival

467
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,120
被尊奉為玉米之王
and revered as the Corn King.

468
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,960
如你所發現的那樣
Last year, as you discovered,

469
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,840
去年獲得這個榮譽的是哈迪老師
Mr Hardy was given the honour.

470
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,160
今年該輪到你了
This year, the crown is yours.

471
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,560
我們發現你是大自然想要的

472
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,520
沒有隔開 還裹著的那種
Uncut and still sheathed.

473
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,040
是新的玉米之王的理想候選人
A perfect candidate for our new corn king.

474
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,960
謝謝你 凱莉 你做得很好
Thank you, Ceri, you did it beautifully.

475
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,460
在退位之后 玉米之王會回歸大地
When his reign is ended, the King is returned to the land

476
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,040
以三種死亡為榮
and honoured with a triple death

477
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,760
淹死 勒死和肢解

478
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,240
他那筒體斷節被埋在田地里
his broken body buried in the field

479
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,680
以確保豐收

480
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,240
就像是人豆
Like human beans!

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,480
沒錯 格溫 就像是人豆

482
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,680
你和那些倫敦人或許會拍拍肩膀
You and your fancy friends in London may pat yourselves on the back

483
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,840
說你們終于意識到了環境問題
that you've finally woken up to environmental issues, but...

484
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,000
可我們已經為地球犧牲幾百年了
..we've been doing our bit for the planet for centuries now.

485
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,360

有三個人從西方走出來
# There were three men come out of the west

498
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,920
他們推著他繞田地游行
# They wheeled him all around the field

499
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,400
他是受難的囚徒
# A prisoner to endure

500
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,280
可憐的巴雷康

501
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,080
被放在谷倉的地上

磨坊主對他更糟糕
# And the miller, he served him worse than that

509

他把他放在兩塊大石頭中間研磨
