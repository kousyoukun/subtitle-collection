牛顿第一定律指出
Newton's first law states that an object in motion...

12
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,480
任何运动的物体都将保持运动状态
..will remain in motion unless an external force...

13
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,760
直到外力迫使它改变
..imposes a change upon it.

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,200
任何处于静止状态的物体 同样将保持静止
Similarly, an object at rest will remain at rest

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,640
直到有一个不平衡的力施加影响
until an unbalanced force affects it.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,600
它也被称为惯性定律
This is also known as the law of inertia.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,520
你好 今天过得怎样
Hi, how was your day?

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,640
有什么吃的吗
Is there any food?

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,680
有 你面前的冰箱里都是食物
Yes, there's a whole fridge full of food in front of you.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,160
都是橄榄和鹰嘴豆泥之类的垃圾
Yeah, but it's all olives and hummus and shit.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,960
有什么真正能吃的东西吗
Something to actually eat?

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,640
不是每顿饭都能直接用托盘端到面前
Um, not every meal comes in a tray, Zach.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,120
有些要用我们所谓的“食材”烹饪
Some are made with what we humans call ingredients.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,560
不要把所有的麦片都吃光
Don't eat all the cereal, please.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,480
不然明天早上就没了
There'll be none left for the morning.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,040
你能把它关掉的 懂吗
You can turn that off, you know.

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,360
关掉什么
Turn what off?

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,080
这个愚蠢的声音
That stupid sound.

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,880
我喜欢
I like it.

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,480
谁叫我没有一个自带敲击声的键盘呢
It makes up for not having a proper bloomin' keyboard.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,240
你到底在做什么
What are you actually doing?

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,440
如果你一定要问的话 我在预约子宫涂片检查
I'm booking a smear test, if you must know.

33
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,120
是你要问的
Well, you asked.

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,280
我都听得头疼了
It's giving me a migraine.

35
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,680
别夸张了
Don't exaggerate.

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,040
我想让你静音
Just disable clicks!

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
我不想静音 要静音你静音
I don't want to disable clicks! You disable clicks.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,760
我之前静音了
I have done.

39
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,800
那就得了
Fine, then.

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,680
你今天过得怎么样
So, how was your day?

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
成绩下来了吗
Did you get your results back?

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,560
扎卡里
Zachary?

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,200
下来了 
Yes.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,320
我得了个B
I got a B.

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,880
你到底想怎样
What do you actually want?

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,320
我想和你谈一谈
It'd be nice if we could just talk.

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,080
想说什么就说吧 我又没有拦着你
You can talk, I'm not stopping you.

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,560
我是说谈话 
I mean...a conversation,

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,080
彼此沟通一下
a bit of back and forth,

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,720
我一个人在这里待了一整天了
I've been here on my own all day.

51
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,840
这不是我的错
That's not my fault.

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,120
这样的要求不过分吧
I don't think it's too much to ask to just sit

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,240
我们抽个晚上坐在一起 聊上半个小时
and have half an hour together of an evening.

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,720
听着 我又不是你的男朋友
Look, I'm not your boyfriend.

55
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,800
如果你想和别人说话 就去用约会软件
If you want to talk to someone, go on...Tinder.

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,080
我来到这个世界上不是为了满足你
I wasn't put on this Earth to make you happy.

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,080
你再说一遍
You can say that again.

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,240
-你什么意思 -没什么意思
-What's that supposed to mean?  -Nothing.

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,000
你想跟抛弃爸爸那样抛弃我吗
You want to bin me off like you did Dad?

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,680
当然不是
Of course I don't.

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,720
而且是他自己离开的 不是我逼的
And it was him who walked out, remember? Not me.

62
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,320
这怪不得他
I don't blame him.

63
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,960
如果我能回到过去 做出一些改变
Look, if I could go back and do things differently,

64
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,520
我非常乐意 但是扎克
I would do, but, Zach,

65
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,960
回不去了 拜托
can't we, please, live together

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,400
我们能不能好好过日子 不要一直吵
without all of this constant argy-bargy?

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,800
让我们都少些抱怨吧
Let's cut the beef, bro.

68
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,440
现在大家都不这么说了
No-one says beef any more.

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,240
真可恶
Oh, bloody hell...

70
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,440
是这样 
Ah, yes, I, er...

71
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
我发现了这只小鸟 双写T
I found this little - double T - bird

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,040
-就在你的房子外面 -怎么
-Just outside your house. -Right.

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,100
很不巧 由于玻璃反光 它直接撞了上去
They fly towards their reflections in the windows, unfortunately.

74
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,720
天哪
Oh, dear.

75
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,520
你觉得我们能为它做些什么吗
Can we do anything for it, do you think?

76
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,480
你有没有一个小箱子 双写L
Er, if you had a small - double L - box

77
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,800
把它安置在一处安静的地方
and a quiet space, he might just come to.

78
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,440
我有 请进吧
Um, yes. Yeah, come in.

79
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,760
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

80
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,160
希望它没有脑震荡
Hopefully, it's not a concussion.

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,200
像是一只麻雀 双写R
Sparrow, I think - double R.

82
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,360
坚强的老鸟
Aw... They're tough old birds.

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,880
可怜的家伙
Poor thing.

84
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,960
我可以放它吧
Er, shall I, er...?

85
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,680
可以 对了 我叫海伦
Oh, yeah. I'm Helen, by the way.

86
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
我叫鲍勃 
Oh, erm, Bob.

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,880
鲍勃·布利斯 双写S
Bob Bliss - double S.

88
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,540
至少我们知道它的内脏还在工作 
At least we know his insides are functioning. 

89
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,240
你怎么知道的
How?

90
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,120
哦 这里有水
Oh, here. Ooh!

91
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,400
谢谢你
Thank you, thanks.

92
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,200
你真是个好人
It's very kind of you.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,000
很多人都无动于衷的
A lot of people wouldn't have cared.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,080
我要抚养一个十几岁的孩子
Oh, well, I have a teenager, so...

95
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,640
再照顾一个小生命算得了什么
..what's another feeble creature to look after?

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,320
我的两个孩子现在都已经飞走了
Both of mine have flown the nest now.

97
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,880
你很幸运
Oh, lucky you.

98
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,640
不 我不应该这么说
No, I shouldn't say that.

99
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,280
-他是个小数学家吗 -谁
-So, is he the mathematician? -He?

100
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,160
你的孩子 双写E
Er, your teenager - double E.

101
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
扎克 没错 他在学习高中课程
Oh, Zach, yes, yes. He's doing his A levels.

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,720
选了数学 物理和化学 老天保佑
Yeah, maths, physics and chemistry, God help him.

103
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,440
选得好
Ha, great combo.

104
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,300
我曾在剑桥大学攻读物理学博士
I did my PhD in physics at Cambridge

105
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,760
那是许多年前的事了
a few years ago.

106
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,910
物理这门课太有趣了 但想学好物理
It's a fascinating subject, but a lot of it does depend

107
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,920
老师非常重要
on the teaching.

108
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,460
不好意思
Excuse me.

109
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,960
说得对 扎克的老师很糟糕 他和我说过
Yes. Zach's teachers are terrible, so he tells me.

110
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,400
这都是 双写L 相较而言的
It's all - double L - relative, so, er...

111
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,240
这是我的儿子 扎克
Aw, this is my son, Zach.

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,680
很高兴见到你 双写E
Pleased to - double E - meet you.

113
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
可恶
Oh, bloody hell!

114
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,040
拜托
Come on. Oh!

115
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,120
它飞走了
There he goes!

116
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,080
扎克 这是鲍勃
Zach, this is Bob.

117
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,840
鲍勃以前在剑桥学习物理
Bob studied physics at Cambridge.

118
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,720
你不打个招呼吗
Aren't you even going to say hi?

119
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
你好
Hi.

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,000
不祥的预兆
Jinx!

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,760
噢 你是让他跟我打招呼 对不起
Oh, you meant him say hi to me? Apologies, er...

122
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,280
扎克 你现在可以说话了
Zach, you can speak now.

123
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,840
我知道我可以 我又不是八岁小孩
I know I can. I'm not eight years old.

124
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,780
就像一个铀238
Right, as one uranium-238 nucleus

125
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,400
对另一个铀238说的那样
said to the other uranium-238 nucleus,

126
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,680
我要裂了
"I've got to split."

127
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,080
他懂了
He gets it.

128
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,640
很高兴见到你 海伦
Yeah, it's nice to have met you, Helen.

129
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,200
扎克 祝你学习顺利
Er, Zach, best of luck with your studies.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,680
希望老师的教学能有所提高
Hope that teaching improves.

131
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,480
如果你遇到了困难 我就住在附近
I live close by, if you ever wanted to go through anything.

132
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,120
等等 不好意思
Wait, erm...sorry.

133
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,240
你平时愿不愿意做家教呢
You don't do any tutoring, do you?

134
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
扎克必须提高他的成绩
It's just that Zach needs to punch up his predicted grades.

135
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,040
-妈妈 -现实就是这样
-Mum! -Well, it's true!

136
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,720
你不想像鲍勃那样考进一所好大学吗
Don't you want to get into a good uni, like Bob did?

137
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,440
你真是太过分了 我好尴尬
She's so cringy, it's embarrassing.

138
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,720
我现在确实有一些空闲时间
I do have some spare time at the moment.

139
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,200
换句话说我还没有成天忙碌 双写L
That is to say, I'm not fully - double L - engaged, erm...

140
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
我可以在周四的6点过来
Yeah, why don't I come round Thursday at six,

141
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,600
看看 双写E 我们进展如何
see - double E - how we get on?

142
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,680
-能不能帮上扎克的忙 -很好 无论如何
-And then if Zach thinks it's useful... -Yeah, whatever.

143
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,160
我只要不和她在一起就行
Anything to avoid spending time with her.

144
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,640
牛顿第二运动定律 其最简单的形式
Newton's second law of motion, in its simplest form,

145
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,440
可以用方程式F=MA表示
can be expressed by the equation F=ma,

146
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,160
或者说力等于质量乘以加速度
or force equals mass times acceleration.

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,080
这就是为什么施加相同的力时
It's why this car, which has a greater mass,

148
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,800
质量较大的这辆车
will travel less far than this car

149
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,280
没有质量较小的走得远
when identical force is applied.

150
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,920
真是太棒了 扎克
Oh, this is top-notch, Zach.

151
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
做得好 双写L
Well - double L - done.

152
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,440
记得在上面写上日期
Remember to put the, er, date on the top.

153
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,960
62年 那是你出生的时候吗
'62? Is that when you were born?

154
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,600
是啊 恐怕我已经很老了
Yes, yes, I'm afraid I am rather old.

155
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,120
为什么F=MA是第二定律的一个特例呢
So why is F=ma a special case of the second law?

156
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,880
它假定质量保持不变
Well, it assumes that the mass remains constant.

157
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,400
使用了一个惯性参照系
It uses an inertial frame of reference.

158
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,560
这意味着什么
Which means?

159
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,880
就是说没有外力作用于它
That there are no outside forces acting on it

160
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,240
使它加速
that make it accelerate.

161
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,360
很好 双写O
Very good - double O.

162
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,640
那么现在有什么外力作用在你身上呢
So, what outside forces are acting on you right now?

163
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,320
重力 
Gravity,

164
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,040
地球旋转
the Earth spinning,

165
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,440
还有你
you...

166
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,760
你被推得越猛 就能走得越远 对吧
And the harder you're pushed, the further you can travel, yes?

167
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
好了 谢谢
OK. Thanks.

168
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,240
我不小心瞥见了你的文身
I, erm... I couldn't help but notice your tattoo 

169
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,320
双写T 双写O
Double T - double O -

170
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,840
是啊
Yeah, er...

171
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,640
我这么做只是为了让我妈生气
I only did it to piss my mum off.

172
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,320
有用吗
And did it work?

173
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,160
她没有注意到
She hasn't noticed.

174
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,680
这就是她对我的关心程度
That's how much she cares about me.

175
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,040
我觉得她是关心你的 扎克
Oh, I think she does care, Zach.

176
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,800
我想她非常关心你 双写E
I think she cares very deeply - double E -

177
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,880
但是你知道受力相同的物体
but, as you know, objects with the same force

178
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
互相排斥
Do repel each other.

179
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,560
是的
Yeah.

180
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,040
不是我故意打听 你父亲是
I don't want to pry, but, erm, is your father...?

181
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,560
他住在新加坡
Oh. He, er, lives in Singapore.

182
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,800
现在有了新的家庭
He's got a new family now, so...

183
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,920
我很少能见到他
..I don't really get to see him that often.

184
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,320
对你和你母亲来说 
That must be hard.

185
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,280
一定很困难
For you and for your mother.

186
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
我无所谓
I don't have a problem with it.

187
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,440
她才是那个该死的疯子
She's the one that's fuckin' mental.

188
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,080
-这个词说得太重了 -你又没有和她一起生活
-That's a strong word to use. -You don't have to live with her.

189
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,040
扎克 
Zach...

190
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,280
-其实我 -晚餐好了
-I'm... -Dinner's ready!

191
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,360
好吧
OK.

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,680
-真好 谢谢你 -你确定不想喝一杯吗
-That was lovely, thank you. -Sure you don't want a glass?

193
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,290
不 这样挺好
No, no, I'm fine.

194
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,810
就一杯吗
Just one?

195
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,580
-说真的 -就一点儿
-Honestly. -Just a little bit?

196
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,160
-说真的 可以了 -好吧 我再来一点
-Honestly, I'm fine. -OK. Well, more for me.

197
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,080
我有一项家庭作业给你
Hey, I've got some homework for you.

198
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,440
周六就是国家障碍赛马大赛
It's the Grand National on Saturday.

199
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,120
你现在研究一下马匹和骑师的重量
Now, study the weights of the horses and the jockeys.

200
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,880
用物理学来预测一下赢家 双写N
Try and use physics to pick us out a winner - double N.

201
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,320
你这是在教他赌博
You're teaching him gambling?

202
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,600
有些不负责任
That's not very responsible.

203
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,720
如果你提前知道赢家 就不算赌博
It's not gambling if you know who's going to win.

204
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,200
为我选一匹马 扎克
Pick me one, Zach.

205
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,280
你自己选吧
Pick your own!

206
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,680
如果你不介意我问的话
So... What do you do with your days?

207
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,560
你平时都做些什么
If you don't mind me asking.

208
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,920
不介意
No, erm...

209
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,920
我兼职做簿记员 双写O 双写K 双写E
I work part time as a book-keeper - double O, double K, double E.

210
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,240
有点拗口
A bit of a mouthful.

211
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,680
确实
Yes.

212
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,000
要是你以打蛋谋生的话
Well...you could be... ..an egg batterer,

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,320
你每天就会说
and then you'd say,

214
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,240
双写G和双写T
"Double G and T," every day! 

215
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,600
最后就会很恼火
You'd end up pissed!

216
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,320
那么继续说
So, go on,

217
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,440
你为什么要这样做 鲍勃
why do you do it, Blob...Bob?

218
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,720
鲍勃·布利斯
Bob Bliss.

219
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,860
你能不能别审问他了
Stop interrogating him. 

220
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,320
这叫谈话 扎克
What? It's called conversation, Zach.

221
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
倾听和学习
Listen and learn.

222
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,080
继续说 双写X双写L都是怎么回事
Go on, what's it all about? Double X, double L?

223
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,000
我想 双写P 这是一种轻微的强迫症
Well, I suppose - double P - it's, er, a mild form of OCD.

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,360
作为一个物理学学生
As a student of physics,

225
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,440
我一直在努力寻找模式 双写T
I was constantly trying to find patterns - double T -

226
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,480
先是在数据和数字中找
in data and numbers,

227
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,720
然后又在文字中找
and then in words.

228
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,440
这么做令我感到平静
Yeah, I find it calming.

229
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,320
我明白了 有时你感觉一切都要分崩离析
I get it. When everything feels like it's unravelling,

230
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,680
就想努力抓住一些东西 就像我点击键盘时发出的音效
and you've just got to hold on to something. It's like my clicks.

231
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,480
我需要这个声音 他想关掉这个声音
I need my clicks, and he doesn't want me to have them,

232
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,880
但我不愿意 它是为我准备的
but I say, "No, they're for me."

233
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,560
烦人
Fuck's sake.

234
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,520
扎克 回来 现在回来
Zach, come back. Come back now.

235
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,760
凭什么
Why?

236
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,400
这样我就可以坐在那里 听你聊一晚上废话吗
So I can sit there and listen to you chat shit all night?

237
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,880
你太可悲了
You're pathetic.

238
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
别想太多
It's OK, honestly.

239
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,520
这只是他的荷尔蒙作祟
I dare say, it's just his hormones,

240
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
加上他爸爸离家的原因
plus his dad walking out.

241
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,360
正好碰上我的荷尔蒙 加上红酒 雪上加霜
Up against my hormones, plus red wine - not a good combo.

242
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,720
我敢说我们在他这个年纪 双写L 也是一样的
I'm sure we were all - double L - the same at his age.

243
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,360
或许我可以花更多时间和他在一起
Maybe if I could spend more time with him, I...

244
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,360
为什么大自然会这样安排
Why does nature do it, eh?

245
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,520
在我们的孩子变成野蛮的怪物时
Give us the menopause

246
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,960
正好赶上我们绝经
just as our kids are becoming feral monsters.

247
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,000
科学能解释这个吗
Can science explain that?

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
他不是怪物 
He's not a monster.

249
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,960
绝对不是
He's not.

250
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,040
他只是正值叛逆期罢了
He's just...an angry young man.

251
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,040
我太累了 鲍勃
I'm so tired, Bob.

252
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,200
我知道
I know.

253
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,360
好了 我要走了
Right, I'd best be off.

254
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,400
谢谢你的晚餐 
Thanks for dinner 

255
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,680
双写N
double N.

256
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,280
还有双写F 走了
And double F - off.

257
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,200
双写F 走了
Double F - off.

258
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,360
力是指一个物体
A force is a push or a pull

259
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
与另一个物体相互作用
that acts upon an object

260
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,440
而作用于该物体的推力或拉力
as a result of its interaction with another object.

261
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,520
这些力遵从牛顿第三运动定律
These forces are subject to Newton's third law of motion.

262
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:10,800
作用力和反作用力大小相等方向相反
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

263
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,280
鲍勃·布利斯
"Bob Bliss."

264
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,640
你好 
Hello?

265
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,960
请讲
Um, speaking.

266
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,280
好的
OK.

267
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,720
今天吗
Today?

268
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,280
好 我半个小时后就到
Um, yes, I can be there in about half an hour.

269
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,400
好的 
Right.

270
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,140
好的 我知道你不能直说
Right, er, I know you... ..you can't tell me,

271
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,520
是不是关于我的检查报告
but is it regarding my test?

272
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,760
不 不 我明白 
No, no. No, no, I understand.

273
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,400
明白 好的
I understand. Right.

274
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,480
好的 谢谢你
Yeah, OK, thank you.

275
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,160
妈妈 你猜怎么着
Hey, Mum, guess what?

276
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,120
鲍勃在周六的赛马大赛上下注了
You know Bob put a bet on the Grand National on Saturday?

277

335
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,070
到了你年老的时候 它飞快地流逝

她是你的 
And yours...

是我们的
..ours...

357
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,240
她不会陪伴你很久了
..she's not going to be around for much longer.

358
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,360
你什么意思
What do you mean?

359
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,920
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

360

等到你去新加坡的时候

你已经不再和她说话了
you'll have stopped speaking to each other,

363
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,440
然后一切就太晚了

364
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,560

你会把自己封闭起来

连你自己的孩子都会离开你

她为你牺牲了多少
just how much she sacrificed for you,

370
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,160
明白她是多么的勇敢
how incredibly brave she was,

371
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,760
这种内疚感会毁掉你的余生
and that guilt will cripple you for life.

372
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,640
不 你在胡说八道

这救不了她 但可以救你
It won't save her, but it could save you.

377
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,840
就当是随手行善了
Just a random act of kindness...

378
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
这样你可以重新开始我的生活
..so you can have my time again.

379
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,800
你好
Hello?

380

扎克 你能听到我吗
Zach, can you hear me?

381
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,320
你到底以为自己在做什么
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

382
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,120
扎克是我儿子 请问你是谁

我认为你的儿子面临极大的危险
I think your son could be in grave danger.

385

你不能让你儿子和他单独在一起

406
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,800
我母亲大概会觉得持续时间有点长
I'm sure me mother would've said it went on a bit too long,

407
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,040
不过很多人也这么说她
but then a lot of people said that about her, as well.

00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,360
-她多大年龄去世的 -93岁

已经算是高寿了 即使以今天的标准来看
Ah, well, that's a very decent age, even by today's standards.

410
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,400
她像只坚强的老鸟
She was a tough old bird.

411
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,800
回到这里却看不见她 感觉很别扭
Strange being back in here without her.

412
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,640
对不起 我可以请你喝一杯吗

我的女儿们告诉我 你开了一个优酷频道
So, me daughters were telling me you have a Youku channel?

415
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,500
是的 我为孩子们拍一些科学小视频
Yes. I do little science videos for children,

416
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,880
都是很基础的东西
pretty basic stuff.

417
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,120
你还想采访我母亲
And you wanted to interview my mother?

418
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,680
没错 我想听她亲口讲述
That's right. I wanted to hear in her own words

419
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,920
她能回忆起的事情
what she could remember.

420
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,060
她是29年
She was one of the first people

421
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,520
第一批试用你的抗癌血清的人
to try your anti-cancer serum back in '29.

422
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,200
那是很久以前的事了
It was a long time ago. 

423
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,960
时间是相对的
Well...Time is relative, so...

424
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,080
-要糖吗 -要 谢谢
-Sugar? -Yes, please.

425
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
所以你是一个真正的科学家
So, you're an actual scientist, then?

426
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,880
不是一个穿白大褂的演员
You're not an actor in a white coat?

427
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,160
对 我都有涉猎
Ha, yes, I do dabble.

428
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,000
实际上我本应该是
In fact, this could've been me,

429
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,480
世界著名的诺贝尔奖得主
world-famous Nobel Prize-winner,

430
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,920
但你骗了我 不是吗 扎克
but you cheated me out of that, didn't you, Zach?

431
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,520
在另一个时空中 你和我 我们是合作伙伴
In another time, we were partners, you and I.

432
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,200
我们一起研究出威尔逊布兰虫洞
We developed the Wilson-Brann wormhole together.

433
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
这是一个开天辟地的成果
It was a game-changer.

434
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,360
让我们赚了几十亿
It made us billions.

435
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,640
它消失了 它消失了
It's gone. It's gone, it's gone, it's gone!

436
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,440
但是因为在这条时间线中
But because, in this timeline,

437
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,400
你没有去新加坡学习物理
you never left to study physics in Singapore,

438
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,320
没有来剑桥大学研究黑洞
you never came to Cambridge to research black holes,

439
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,360
所以我们从来没有见过面
and so we...never met.

440
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,040
你一心一意钻研化学
You devoted your life to chemistry,

441
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,320
致力于肿瘤学研究
oncological research.

442
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,620
我最后以科学怪人布兰博士的身份
I ended up doing Youku videos

443
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,160
在优酷拍摄视频
as Dr Brann the Science Man.

444
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,440
你最好马上离开这里
I'd like you to leave now, please.

445
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,440
然后有一天 我在清理我的垃圾邮件时
And then, one day, I was clearing out my spam folder

446
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,880
发现了一条视频信息
and I found a video message

447
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,400
那是我给自己发的邮件
I had apparently just emailed to myself.

448
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,560
我察觉到 无需再过很长时间
I must've realised that I didn't have long

449
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,640
我那个版本的生活就将不复存在
before that version of my life ceased to exist.

450
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,360
你可以回到过去
You can go back in time...

451
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,880
我一直觉得自己过上了错误的人生
I always felt I was living the wrong life.

452
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
你把我本该有的人生偷走了
The life you stole from me...

453
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,400
我想把它要回来
..I want it back.

454
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,400
-它在哪里 -什么
-Where is it? -What?

455
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,600
跨时空发报机
The Trans-Temporal-Telegraph.

456
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,640
我们的时间机器
Our time machine.

457
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,520
你用它来探访小时候的自己
The one you used to visit yourself as a boy.

458
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,160
它就是一台破烂 我把它扔了
That was just junk. I got rid of it.

459
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,880
-我不相信你 -没骗你
-I don't believe you. -It's true.

460
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,360
鲍勃疯了
Bob was insane.

461
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,000
不
No.

462
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,600
我们要回去了 威尔逊博士
We're going back, Dr Wilson.

463
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,560
现在一切重启
It's time to reset.

464
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,600
不 求你了
No, please.

465
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,920
-求你了 我妈妈 -我不管
-Please. My mother... -Fuck her.

466
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,280
我不想受到你的间接伤害了
I'm not prepared to be your collateral damage.

467
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,440
真可恶
Oh, bloody hell...
