1
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,319
Oh, God.

2
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,039
Never again.

3
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:14,998
Vodka and Coco Pops?

4
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:16,518
Are you serious?

5
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,039
There's no milk.

6
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,978
Do you want me to eat them dry?

7
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,718
You've only just got out of bed.

8
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,519
I know, I'm a walking cliche. What can I tell you?

9
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,879
Fetch me a spoon.

10
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,479
So, is this why they took you off the case?

11
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,358
What, the drinking? Ah...

12
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,439
I can run round for round with any of those plods,

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,279
and still not lose my lunch at an autopsy.

14
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,199
-You bounce back. -Exactly.

15
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,239
Well, they do call you "Nine Lives Kat".

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,279
-Do they? -Yeah. Short for Katrina.

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,838
Mm! Hear that, Kitney?

18
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:55,239
I've got a nickname, just like you.

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,759
Kitney Spears.

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,678
Funny.

21
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:00,158
I used to have two,

22
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,679
but David Meowie got run over.

23
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,078
That's good.

24
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:15,119
So, go on, then, why did they take you off the case?

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,518
They're dinosaurs.

26
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:19,658
They can't stand being told the truth by a woman.

27
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:22,799
Simple as that. My ex-husband is exactly the same.

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,718
Erm, ex-husbands.

29
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,239
-There's been more than one, remember? -Who's counting?

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,079
You know what?

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,919
I'll show them.

32
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,919
I will show them you do not need a cock and balls to crack a case,

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,039
or stack a dishwasher in the most ergonomic way possible.

34
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,599
You just need...

35
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:50,479
..a brain and a heart, and guts.

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,159
And that's what I've got.

37
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,399
You going to help me, or what?

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,019
Of course I am...

39
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,639
..Nine Lives Kat.

40
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,158
OK, bring me up to speed.

41
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,018
So, we've got five suspects who were all seen on CCTV

42
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,828
in and around the area at the time of the abduction.

43
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,638
I'm still in the process of fleshing out their stories,

44
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,479
but it seems two of them have links to the family that could

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,259
throw up some interesting leads.

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,038
Let's not talk about throwing up.

47
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,558
Not until these Coco Pops have settled.

48
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:25,719
What about the stepfather? Surely he's our prime suspect.

49
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,159
I'd rather say he's "helping us with our inquiries".

50
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,358
Let's arrange a press conference for this afternoon.

51
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:37,719
If he breaks down in tears and says, "We just want our angel back,"

52
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,999
we know it's definitely him.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,119
Will do.

54
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,079
I thought you were off the case.

55
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:00,799
There's a little boy out there tonight who's frightened.

56
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,799
He's trapped, he can't breathe...

57
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,158
..and I'm going to find him.

58
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,198
I'm going to bring him out into the light

59
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,799
and I don't care whose toes I have to tread on to do it.

60
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,598
When you were little and your milk teeth fell out,

61
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:38,738
I used to take them from under your pillow and leave 50p.

62
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:42,879
And I'd keep them in a Tic Tac box in the bathroom cabinet.

63
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,158
When the job got too much for me,

64
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,479
or your dad was being difficult...

65
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,719
..I'd empty them into the palm of my hand

66
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,359
and squeeze as hard as I could...

67
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,239
..your teeth in my fist...

68
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,319
..until I felt...blood.

69
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,479
Until I felt...

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,519
..alive.

71
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:45,358
Right, take me through it again.

72
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:48,518
11.15am, Ashley finishes his karate lesson

73
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,739
and is picked up from the Methodist church by his mum.

74
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,338
11.30, they pull into the retail park,

75
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,439
where Mum goes to McDonald's to buy a Happy Meal,

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,339
telling Ashley to stay in the car.

77
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,238
Now, five minutes prior to this,

78
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,719
we have the green Vauxhall Corsa parking up outside Hollywood Bowl

79
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,199
driven by sunglasses man...

80
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,479
Mummy?

81
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,399
Ohhh! God.

82
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,079
Trust you to be here.

83
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,358
Charming!

84
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:06,398
Have you seen Kitney Spears?

85
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,439
No. She's, er, she's gone.

86
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,159
Ha! Dirty stop-out.

87
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,879
Mind you, I can talk.

88
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,998
So, what have you got for me?

89
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:20,918
-How do you mean? -The missing boy.

90
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,879
Have you checked out the alibis of the five suspects?

91
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:28,238
-That was a long time ago. -What do you mean?

92
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,239
Kat, I haven't seen you in several months.

93
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,118
I saw you two days ago.

94
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:37,078
What are you talking about?!

95
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,039
Just...give me time to catch up.

96
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,219
-Where's it gone? -What?

97
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,189
The entire investigation!

98
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,158
Er, I've still got the notes.

99
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,719
I just didn't think it was good to put it up on the wall.

100
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,239
You have no right to tell me how to run this case.

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,358
No right at all! Do you hear me?

102
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:55,759
I was...I was this close to making a breakthrough.

103
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,078
You're up.

104
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,478
Er, Katrina...

105
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,558
She prefers to be called Kat.

106
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
Ah. I don't know what happened last night.

107
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,239
You seemed very agitated.

108
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,358
We'd both had a lot to drink.

109
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,879
But if it's any consolation, I don't think we actually...

110
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,279
Actually what?

111
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,438
Elvis did not enter the building.

112
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,919
-Is this guy for real? -Sorry, you are...?

113
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,739
Er, DI Bull. Barnabus Bull.

114
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,558
I'm a colleague of Katrina's.

115
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:26,578
We have a, sort of, love-hate relationship.

116
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:28,648
I'm sensing a hate phase at the moment...

117
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,718
Just shut up, Barney! I'm trying to think.

118
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,639
Sure, sure, although, er, strictly speaking, of course,

119
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,278
all thinking is subconscious,

120
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,558
because consciousness is an awareness of thoughts,

121
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,279
not thinking itself, so you can't actually try to think.

122
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,519
Why don't you go and put the kettle on?

123
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,478
I'm not sure it would fit.

124
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,718
No, I mean SWITCH the kettle on.

125
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:51,279
-I think we could all do with a drink. -Oh, yeah, sure.

126
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,198
He's quite a character.

127
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:59,839
A bit spectrum-y, perhaps.

128
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,008
I'm not shagging him.

129
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,678
I know, I didn't say you were!

130
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,558
It's just an interesting development, that's all.

131
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:10,679
Look, I know you think I'm taking this case too personally.

132
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,819
But I'm a woman.

133
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,958
And I empathise.

134
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,958
And I know how to fight,

135
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,879
and I know how to dig my heels in.

136
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,718
And let me tell you

137
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:25,519
size eight stilettos dig in deep.

138
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,519
Now, what have you done with my case notes?

139
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,799
Erm, do you have any loose-leaf tea?

140
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,478
I can't bear the bags.

141
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,199
They never steep in quite the right way.

142
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,199
One second.

143
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:07,439
Is that really the best we can do?

144
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,439
Jump-scares with a cat?

145
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,158
Why...are you always here?

146
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:16,598
I don't remember giving you a key.

147
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,759
What happened to the missing boy - Ashley?

148
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,359
What are you not telling me?

149
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,239
I've tried with you, Katrina, I really, really have...

150
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,599
..but I just don't think it's working.

151
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:37,238
Oh, please do not come in here! I have a system.

152
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,959
-I know where everything is. -It's all right, Barnabus.

153
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,919
We can pick this up later.

154
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,878
What's he doing here?

155
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,538
Get out of my bloody house!

156
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,199
It's not your house, Kat.

157
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:51,359
It never was.

158
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,758
Come on, Katy.

159
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,798
Katy, there's a good girl.

160
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,198
Katy Purry. A bit more contemporary.

161
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:02,978
I'd written a couple of collections of short stories,

162
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:05,758
been nominated for a Gold Dagger, pretty healthy sales,

163
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,999
when my publisher decided I ought to write a series of detective novels.

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,198
Well, I wasn't that keen,

165
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,998
but I made a few notes, had a brainstorm,

166
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:18,879
and out of nowhere, I wrote down "Nine Lives Kat".

167
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,999
-It's a good title. -It is, yes. Thank you.

168
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,598
So, I tinkered with the idea,

169
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:25,478
er, made up some bog-standard case

170
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,519
of a missing child just so I could interrogate the character

171
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,559
and see if it added up to anything.

172
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,259
The character...based on me?

173
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,959
No, the character OF you.

174
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,678
Katrina...surname.

175
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,358
Never got that far.

176
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,479
Erm, late 40s, a couple of divorces,

177
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,239
single mum, booze, pills,

178
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,998
clashes with authority.

179
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,359
And what I realised when I read it back was...

180
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,479
..it's all a bit cliched.

181
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,598
-I said that. -I know.

182
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,718
I said that on page bloody one!

183
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:59,568
I know you did and I should learn to listen to that critical voice.

184
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:03,419
But at the time, I was watching episodes of Cracker and Prime Suspect,

185
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,878
and I thought, "I can write one of those!"

186
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,039
So I tried, and you just turned out to be a bit...

187
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,278
Generic.

188
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,599
Fuck off, Rain Man.

189
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,198
It's all right, Katy! It's all right.

190
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:20,359
Anyway, I popped you down here in the bottom drawer for a while,

191
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,539
and every now and again, I dig you out,

192
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,719
see if there's anything I could work with.

193
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,318
I do a lot of screenwriting now,

194
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:30,599
and the streaming platforms are always dying for female-led content.

195
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,079
That and dystopian fucking fantasy worlds, anyway.

196
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,279
You think you're some... patriarchal creator?

197
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,119
God of your own little universe?

198
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,119
Well, sorry. I'm real.

199
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,999
My life is real.

200
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,879
No, it isn't.

201
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,359
It isn't.

202
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:54,559
You're a fictional construct.

203
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,998
I mean, look around you.

204
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,318
Would a real person live like this?

205
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:02,438
You know, one spoon, one bowl, one box of cereal?

206
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:05,938
You're just...a sketch, Kat, a first-thought idea.

207
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:09,928
-No, no. -The boss, the ex-husbands, What are they?

208
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:13,919
-They're just ciphers. -No, I-I-I have a daughter.

209
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,719
And what's her name?

210
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,079
You don't know, do you?

211
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,399
Sh! Her name is...

212
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,399
You don't know, cos I never bothered to give her one.

213
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,419
She was just an afterthought,

214
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,819
tacked on to try and make you more interesting.

215
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,998
No!

216
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,278
No, no...

217
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,559
No! No!

218
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:02,159
I've wrestled with this idea for some time, getting writer's block.

219
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,718
It was quite difficult,

220
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,758
so I tried pairing you with another character

221
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,799
to see if that would freshen things up a bit.

222
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,118
DI Barnabus Bull.

223
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,519
I just love that name. It's so satisfying to say.

224
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,919
"Barnabus Bull." My publisher likes it, too.

225
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,278
I found out today. Three-book deal.

226
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:21,639
Yes! Red Rag To A Bull, The Bull's-Eye, Bull...

227
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,438
Shit.

228
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:25,478
..In A China Shop.

229
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:28,519
There's a long way to go yet before we have to worry about titles.

230
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,478
So...he gets to have a life,

231
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:34,439
and I go back in the bottom drawer just because he's got a...

232
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,219
..unspecified mental illness?

233
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,049
Stop shouting. Stop shouting!

234
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,879
Stop shouting! Stop shouting!

235
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,028
There might be a victim's mother

236
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,739
or a jealous mistress I can use you for,

237
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,399
but in terms of this,

238
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,439
Nine Lives Kat, flawed detective with inner demons...

239
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,758
..we've seen it all before.

240
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,759
And whose fault is that?

241
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,978
Yes, you're right.

242
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:04,878
It's not you, it's me.

243
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,839
So...the missing boy, he's your son, isn't he?

244
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,704
Ashley? Yeah,

245
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:14,279
just a placeholder.Something to visualise.

246
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,758
You know, people think that writing's all in the head,

247
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,839
but sometimes you have to make it real for yourself.

248
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,839
Are those my notes?

249
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,239
I've got to let you go.

250
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,519
Please don't.

251
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,199
You've run out of lives, Kat.

252
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,778
Oh, hi, Georgie. I was just about to call you, actually.

253
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,479
Yeah, I'm just, er, finishing the synopsis for the new Bull.

254
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,579
It's a sort of locked-room mystery.

255
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,679
Quite pleased with it, actually.

256
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,534
Yeah, I will do.

257
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:37,299
Erm, now, listen, I was just wondering

258
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,738
where we are with the TV rights.

259
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:41,399
Are they still with whatshisname at ITV?

260
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,958
OK, cos I was watching

261
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,178
Jude Law in The Talented Mr. Ripley last night,

262
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,399
and I was thinking he could be really good.

263
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,999
Or Matt Damon.

264
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,718
Yeah.

265
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:54,158
Yeah, he, er...he'd get the intensity, and, er,

266
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,319
he was great in that Sky thing a couple of years ago.

267
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,838
Matt Damon!

268
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,239
They're not going to get Matt Damon, all right? He's American!

269
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,959
No, sorry, sorry, I was just talking to Philippa,

270
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,679
Erm, OK, well, listen, I'll send it to you, and, er,

271
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,319
you can let me know what you think.

272
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,278
Thanks, Georgie. Bye for now.

273
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,898
Will you stop interfering in my private phone calls, please?

274
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:16,519
-I'm only saying what you're thinking. -Well, it's irritating.

275
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,719
You just concentrate on how Bull knew about

276
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,639
the false floor in the basement.

277
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,518
Carpet tiles.

278
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,598
-What? -Carpet tiles.

279
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,199
Should've been black square to the left, like a chessboard.

280
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,739
When we got there, it was cream square to the left

281
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,279
ergo someone must've taken them up and re-laid them.

282
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,789
Yes, like a chessboard.

283
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,994
So, if we make Colin gay

284
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:40,199
and Alan a sir or something,

285
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,238
we can say the...

286
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:44,359
Queen was taken by the knight! Brilliant!

287
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,379
Hi!

288
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,759
Hi.

289
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:48,144
Did you get everything?

290
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:49,798
Yes. It was busy, though.

291
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,839
Do you know how to do find my phone?

292
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,918
What? I can't find it.

293
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,079
I think I had it in the car park when I arrived.

294
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,999
Someone must've had it out of my pocket.

295
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,019
Well, if you will go to Asda

296
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,918
and not Waitrose...

297
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,998
Where were you when you sent me that text?

298
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:06,119
-Which text? -About picking Ash up from swimming.

299
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,879
You were picking Ash up from swimming.

300
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,359
No, you texted me to say not to.

301
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,839
-No, I didn't. -Yes, you did. Look!

302
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:16,679
That's not my text!

303
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,609
Where is he?

304
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,538
Ashley? Ashley?!

305
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:22,838
He's not here. I just told you.

306
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:25,759
-Why didn't you pick him up?! -Cos you said you were going to!

307
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,799
What if someone took your wife's phone to send the text?

308
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,919
What the fuck are you talking about?

309
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,519
The fuck are YOU talking about?

310
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,679
Where is he? Ezra!

311
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,839
Where's my son?!

312
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,138
Any news?

313
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,759
Not yet.

314
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:16,418
Where is he, Ez? I can't bear it.

315
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:19,598
Sh. He's going to be all right.

316
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,679
OK? He's going to be all right, I promise.

317
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:30,519
Oh, hello.I thought I heard another voice. I made some tea.

318
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,919
Thanks.

319
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,998
I'm Matilda Gordon.

320
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:37,758
Your wife's probably told you.

321
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,959
-I'm family liaison. -She did, yes.

322
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,599
I'm a big fan.

323
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,238
Oh, thank you.

324
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:48,079
I'd love a selfie at... at some point.

325
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,039
Erm, not now.

326
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,038
No. No.

327
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,758
I was just asking your wife if you could

328
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,219
think of anyone who might have a grudge against you.

329
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:02,079
Anyone you might have upset or offended?

330
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,599
No. No, I don't think so.

331
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:08,319
Nobody you based one of your characters on in your stories?

332
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,839
I'm a writer. I invent characters.

333
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,678
Of course.

334
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,078
And your son...sorry, stepson...

335
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,559
..has he had any fallings-out or arguments recently?

336
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,519
No, we've been through this already.

337
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,999
He was always well liked.

338
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,659
"Was"?!

339
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,318
Is.

340
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,719
Sorry, Phil, I've just woken up.

341
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,478
I'm sorry.

342
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,839
It's the shock. The body shuts down.

343
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,618
I went through your medicine cabinet...

344
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:43,968
..to see if you were on any medication,

345
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,319
and I found this hidden at the back.

346
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,218
They're teeth.

347
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:53,319
Children's teeth.

348
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:04,319
Are they Ashley's?

349
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:10,638
Philippa said she didn't remember keeping them.

350
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:14,039
I, er, I think maybe they belong to a colleague of mine

351
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,279
who was helping me with a story.

352
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,678
I see.

353
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,638
Another case for Barnabus Bull?

354
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,359
No. No, it's-it's-it's literally nothing,

355
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,999
just background research.

356
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,638
I never even finished it.

357
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,839
I would very much like to read it, Mr. Jones...

358
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,319
...as a fan, as much as anything else.

359
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,599
Sure.

360
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,999
I can't seem to, er...find it.

361
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:53,704
Barnabus,

362
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:56,679
you haven't seen my notes for Nine Lives Kat, have you?

363
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:03,238
No, my name's Matilda, dear.

364
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:05,639
Barnabus is a fictional character.

365
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:08,959
He doesn't exist.

366
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:26,079
Ashley?

367
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,279
Hello?

368
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,418
Well! It's true what they say.

369
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:08,759
You can't put a good book down.

370
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,398
What are you doing here?

371
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:16,239
I had to come for the final chapter...

372
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,679
..see how it all turns out.

373
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,278
I didn't write this.

374
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,718
No, this is not a fictional construct,

375
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:28,039
this is actually happening. In your kitchen.

376
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,638
Exciting, isn't it?

377
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:32,519
Maybe I'm not so generic after all.

378
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,399
Where's Ashley?

379
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,198
He's safe.

380
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,878
He'll come to no harm...

381
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:40,279
..unlike our friendly liaison officer.

382
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,238
She doesn't look too clever.

383
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:45,119
Oh, she was onto you, wasn't she?

384
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,718
The shifty stepfather?

385
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,918
So, you had to silence her.

386
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,319
I never touched her, and you know I didn't!

387
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,638
Not how it looks.

388
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:59,478
Maybe...she found your wife's mobile...

389
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:04,319
..hidden away in your bottom drawer.

390
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,119
You're framing me.

391
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,999
Yes, I am.

392
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:14,319
Or is that too cliched, Ezra?

393
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,439
What do you want me to do next?

394
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,559
This?

395
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:29,079
Or.....this?

396
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:49,079
You always were a lousy lay, Ezra.

397
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,079
Oh, come on, Mr. Writer.

398
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,819
We're in your hands.

399
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,559
What's a better ending?

400
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:58,158
What do you want?

401
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,598
I want you to finish my story.

402
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,359
I want to find the boy seconds before he runs out of oxygen.

403
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,718
I want to expose the affair

404
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,679
between the neighbour and the stepfather.

405
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,558
I want to walk out of an AA meeting

406
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:12,279
and throw my police badge into the river!

407
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,918
-Really? -And I want it...

408
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,439
I want it in paperback and hardback on the shelf!

409
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,999
Not self-published on Amazon as a shitty Kindle exclusive.

410
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,558
All right.

411
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,578
All right, I'll do it,

412
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:35,039
but then, you have to leave me and my family alone. Deal?

413
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,599
Deal.

414
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,318
Sorry, am I dead now?

415
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:50,478
And am I a lesbian now?

416
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:52,639
Or is that all in his head?

417
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,278
Quiet!

418
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,159
I am trying to think!

419
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:05,399
Ohh, I've written myself into a corner.

420
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,399
I knew this was going to happen.

421
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:12,319
You know how some artists can't do hands?

422
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,638
Well, I can't do endings.

423
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:18,679
Resolving everything on the final page, it's just...

424
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,879
it's just not believable!

425
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:27,339
But then... But then, it wouldn't be a Matilda Gordon novel

426
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,529
if it didn't have that final twist.

427
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,558
What's going on?

428
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,039
I thought I was writing an updated Frankenstein

429
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,418
The Postmodern Prometheus,

430
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,399
but it's all gone a bit... Stephen King.

431
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,738
A hack horror novelist

432
00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:46,479
haunted by his own characters.

433
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,639
-I'm not a hack. -No.

434
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,038
A good story's a good story.

435
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,979
And this isn't bad... for a first draft.

436
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:58,988
Still, I think I'll have to leave you

437
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:01,759
in the bottom drawer for a while,

438
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,858
see if I can't come up

439
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:04,739
with a more satisfactory denouement.

440
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,919
No, no, no, no, wait, wait! Wait, I can help you.

441
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:14,519
I've won a Gold Dagger. My books are bestsellers!

442
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,359
Well, they're not, really, though.

443
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,959
Are they, darling?

444
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,279
They are a figment of my imagination.

445
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,639
Just like you.

446
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,858
Oh, God.

447
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:36,519
And I am afraid you are not quite leaping off the page.

448
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,599
Please don't.

449
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,319
Bye for now!

450
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,559
Oh, sh...

451
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,359
# Two little ducks went swimming one day

452
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:58,119
# Over the hill and far away

453
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,559
# Mother duck said, "Quack, quack quack, quack,"

454
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:11,239
♪ But only one little duck came back. ♪
