1
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:13,481
MAI CHI?
SHE IS HERE?

2
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,163
MAI CHI?

3
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,067
WHAT SPIRIT
CALLS MY NAME?

4
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:35,002
SPIRIT?

5
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:37,605
I AM HERE BEFORE YOU
IN LIFE.

6
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,340
DECEITFUL GHOST.

7
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,076
WHY "GHOST?"

8
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:45,045
IF YOU WERE REAL,
I COULD SEE YOU.

9
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,184
MAI CHI...

10
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:53,387
IT IS SAID YOU HAVE
THE GIFT OF PROPHESY.

11
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:57,225
WHO WERE YOU
IN LIFE, POOR GHOST?

12
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,529
I AM KWAI CHANG CAINE.

13
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:05,633
I SERVE ONLY
THOSE WHO PURSUE
ILLUSIONS.

14
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:10,604
IT IS SUCH A QUESTION THAT
MAKES ME SEEK YOU OUT...

15
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:15,576
FOR I, TOO, MAY BE
PURSUING AN ILLUSION.

16
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,211
TELL ME.

17
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:22,116
TWO YEARS AND LONGER,
SINCE I CAME TO AMERICA,

18
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:26,587
I HAVE SOUGHT THE MAN
WHO IS MY BROTHER.

19
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:31,759
I REMAIN IN DOUBT
IF HE IS ALIVE...

20
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,362
OR IF HE WAS EVER ALIVE.

21
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,832
DO YOU HAVE HANDS, GHOST
OF KWAI CHANG CAINE?

22
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,908
THE MAN YOU CALL
BROTHER--

23
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,477
THE MAN NAMED
DANNY CAINE--

24
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,813
IS WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE END OF
THIS JOURNEY.

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,483
BUT IT WOULD BE
BETTER FOR HIM
AND FOR YOU

26
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,286
IF YOU WOULD NOT
FIND HIM.

27
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,154
WHY?

28
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,924
OTHERS SEEK HIM
AS YOU DO, AND
WILL FIND HIM...

29
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,661
AND DEATH WILL BE
CLOSE BEHIND.

30
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,432
CAN YOU TELL ME
NOTHING MORE?

31
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,867
HOW CAN I ANSWER,
GHOST,

32
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,704
WHEN I NEITHER SEE
NOR HEAR YOU?

33
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,617
WAIT.

34
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,920
BEWARE, SHAOLIN.

35
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,857
YOU, TOO, ARE NOT
ABOVE ILLUSION.

36
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,614
Master Kan:
YOUR TREAD MUST BE
LIGHT AND SHORT,

37
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,284
AS THOUGH YOUR PATH
WERE UPON RICE PAPER.

38
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:43,123
IT IS SAID
A SHAOLIN PRIEST CAN
WALK THROUGH WALLS.

39
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,759
LOOKED FOR,
HE CANNOT BE SEEN.

40
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:49,263
LISTENED FOR,
HE CANNOT BE HEARD.

41
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,566
TOUCHED,
HE CANNOT BE FELT.

42
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,469
THIS RICE PAPER
IS THE TEST.

43
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,539
FRAGILE AS THE WINGS
OF THE DRAGONFLY.

44
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:02,343
CLINGING AS THE COCOON
OF THE SILKWORM.

45
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,047
WHEN YOU CAN
WALK ITS LENGTH
AND LEAVE NO TRACE,

46
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,916
YOU WILL HAVE LEARNED.

47
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,068
WELL?

48
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,303
I ASKED HIM
FOR DIRECTIONS.

49
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,138
GOT A REAL
GOOD LOOK AT HIM.

50
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,973
YOU WERE RIGHT.
THAT'S HIM.

51
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,508
I THOUGHT SO.

52
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,244
TURNED INTO A FARMER.

53
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,112
WOMAN'S HIS WIFE.

54
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,383
MORE LIKELY, HIS WIDOW...
GIVE OR TAKE A DAY OR TWO.

55
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,517
WHAT'S
THE NEXT MOVE?

56
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:44,752
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

57
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,020
SEE HE STAYS PUT.
WAIT FOR CURLY BILL.

58
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,589
WHY WAIT?
I CAN HANDLE IT.

59
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,691
YOU'RE TOO ANXIOUS,
SLADE.

60
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:54,395
MAYBE SO,
BUT I'M HERE...
AND I'M READY.

61
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:55,929
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

62
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,234
I'M OLD ENOUGH.

63
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,604
YOU'RE OUT OF
KNEE PANTS HOW LONG?

64
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,572
8 YEARS?

65
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,206
LISTEN, FORBES,
I COULD TAKE HIM.

66
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,709
MR. FORBES TO YOU,
SONNY.

67
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:12,446
NO, THIS IS
CURLY BILL'S PLAY.

68
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,483
MAYBE YOU'LL MAKE IT
ONE DAY, IF YOU'RE SMART.

69
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,718
YOU'RE HEAR TO WATCH
AND TO LEARN.

70
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,921
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

71
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,523
EXCUSE ME...

72
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:27,461
I AM LOOKING FOR THE FARM
OF DANIEL CAINE.

73
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,366
RIGHT DOWN THERE.

74
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,036
THANK YOU.

75
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,493
Young Caine: MASTER...

76
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,431
OF MAN'S ROOTS,
WHICH IS THE STRONGER?

77
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,533
IT IS A SHAOLIN BELIEF

78
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,502
THAT THE PATERNAL LINE
CONTROLS.

79
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,804
Caine: WHAT IS A MAN
WITHOUT ROOTS?

80
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,441
WHAT IS A TREE
WITHOUT ROOTS?

81
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,076
THE DEEPER INTO THE EARTH
THE ROOTS REACH,

82
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,411
THE STRONGER THE TREE.

83
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,096
Young Caine: A NAME,
A FACE IN MY MIND...

84
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,298
A PLACE...

85
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,333
IT IS ALL I KNOW
OF MY FATHER.

86
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,736
ONE HALF OF MYSELF,
AN EMPTINESS...

87
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,738
A MYSTERY.

88
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,575
Master Kan: SEEK
TO DISCOVER IT, THEN,

89
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,544
FOR IT IS THIS THREAD
WHICH HOLDS YOU
TO THE PAST

90
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,680
AND BINDS YOU
TO THE FUTURE...

91
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,016
TO FIX YOUR PLACE
FOR ALL TIME IN ETERNITY.

92
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,379
YES?

93
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,618
I AM SEEKING
DANIEL CAINE.

94
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:38,258
ARE YOU A FRIEND OF HIS?

95
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,662
NOT EXACTLY
A FRIEND...

96
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,864
AND NOT A STRANGER,
EITHER.

97
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,067
AND YOU?

98
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,003
I'M DANNY'S WIFE...
ADA.

99
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,472
I SHOULD--

100
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,576
NO, THANK YOU.
I CAN MANAGE.

101
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,845
BUT YOU NEVER TOLD ME
WHO YOU ARE.

102
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:00,814
A RELATIVE.

103
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:06,219
OH...
I'LL GET HIM.

104
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:23,203
MY FATHER IS DEAD.
SO IS MY MOTHER.

105
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,573
BROTHERS? SISTERS?

106
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,508
I HAVE NONE.

107
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,043
YOU HAVE ONE.

108
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:35,616
BROTHER.
HALF BROTHER,
I GUESS.

109
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:38,819
YOUR FATHER WAS
MARRIED ONCE BEFORE.

110
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:42,189
HE'D BE ABOUT 3...
4 YEARS OLDER
THAN YOU.

111
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,191
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

112
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:50,130
YOU ARE THE SON
OF THOMAS HENRY CAINE?

113
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,466
WHO ARE YOU?

114
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,303
I AM KWAI CHANG CAINE...

115
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,306
YOUR BROTHER.

116
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,944
BUT YOU'RE CHINESE.

117
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,281
HALF BROTHER.

118
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,484
OUR FATHER IS THE SAME.

119
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:16,423
WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIED,
HE WENT TO CHINA...

120
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,059
WHERE HE MET...
MY MOTHER.

121
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,305
I WAS NEVER TOLD.

122
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,542
NOR WAS I...

123
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:38,979
UNTIL I CAME TO
OUR GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE.

124
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,253
HE GAVE ME THESE.

125
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,928
THE LETTERS YOU WROTE HIM.

126
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,664
HE NEVER
ANSWERED THEM.

127
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,667
I...STOPPED WRITING.

128
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:03,103
HE ASKED ME TO FIND YOU.

129
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,240
WE HAVE A COMMON BOND
OF BLOOD.

130
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,348
YOU, UH...YOU KNOW
A LOT ABOUT ME

131
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,850
FROM THESE LETTERS.

132
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,853
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

133
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,490
WHAT DO YOU WISH TO KNOW?

134
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,793
THERE'S TIME.

135
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,728
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO STAY, OF COURSE.

136
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,563
I CAN FIX YOU
A PLACE TO SLEEP
BY THE FIRE.

137
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,232
WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH ROOM, BUT--

138
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,366
THANK YOU.

139
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,403
I DO NOT WISH
TO UNSETTLE YOU.

140
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,507
PERHAPS I COULD SLEEP
IN THE BARN?

141
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,042
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

142
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,015
SUPPER WILL BE
READY SOON.

143
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,983
I HAVE EATEN.

144
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,887
I HAVE COME A LONG WAY.

145
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,790
YOU'LL WANNA
GET SOME REST.

146
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,992
WE'LL TALK
IN THE MORNING.

147
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,215
YOU DIDN'T GIVE HIM
A VERY WARM RECEPTION.

148
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,355
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO GREET HIM, ADA.

149
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,690
AFTER ALL, I DON'T HAVE
A FULL-GROWN BROTHER

150
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,293
MATERIALIZING ON
MY DOORSTEP EVERY DAY.

151
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,462
PARTICULARLY CHINESE.

152
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,530
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

153
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,867
HEY--DON'T DO THAT.

154
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,102
THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
NOT TO LIFT
ANYTHING HEAVY.

155
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,738
OH, DANNY,
STOP BABYING ME.

156
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,039
I'M NOT BABYING YOU.

157
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:49,042
I'M BABYING
THE BABY.

158
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,708
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,
CURLY BILL.

159
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:22,843
WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT?

160
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,145
HE'S DOWN THERE
IN THAT FARMHOUSE.

161
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,451
PUT HIMSELF
OUT TO PASTURE, HUH?

162
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:34,221
IT'S A GOOD PLACE
TO HIDE OUT.

163
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,890
WELL, MAYBE NOT...

164
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,758
'CAUSE WE FOUND HIM.

165
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,895
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING HIM...

166
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,264
FOR A LONG TIME.

167
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,201
NO SIGN OF HIM YET.

168
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,004
JUST THAT CHINESE FLUNKY
DOWN THERE DOING CHORES.

169
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,874
DON'T WORRY.
HE'S THERE.

170
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,345
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY...

171
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,215
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
KIND OF LIKE A HERO TO ME.

172
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:15,355
I'M REAL ANXIOUS
TO MEET HIM.

173
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,556
I KNOW.

174
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,378
WHY...DID YOU DO ALL THIS?

175
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,579
THANK YOU.

176
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,316
WOULD IT NOT BE
MORE CONVENIENT

177
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,685
TO HAVE A WELL
NEAR THE HOUSE?

178
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:46,753
IT WOULD BE
WONDERFUL!

179
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,956
ONLY THING IS, UH...

180
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,058
THERE ISN'T ANY WATER
NEAR THE HOUSE.

181
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:54,127
OH,
BUT THERE IS.

182
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:55,895
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

183
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:59,466
CERTAIN PLANTS DO NOT
GROW BUT OVER WATER.

184
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,269
DANNY?

185
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,174
THERE ARE TOO MANY
OTHER THINGS
I GOTTA DO FIRST.

186
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,442
I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO DIG THE WELL.

187
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,380
WE'VE GOTTEN ALONG
WITHOUT IT, SO FAR.

188
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,452
AS YOU WISH.

189
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,121
LOOK...

190
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,957
WHAT DO I CALL YOU?

191
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,425
KWAI CHANG.

192
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,495
KWAI CHANG.

193
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,165
IT IS MY NAME.

194
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,234
WELL, IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR WORK,

195
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,504
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
TO DO AROUND A FARM.

196
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,672
I WOULD BE GRATEFUL.

197
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,408
ALRIGHT.
COME ON.

198
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,380
BREAKFAST
WILL BE READY
IN HALF AN HOUR.

199
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:55,422
Danny: THIS'LL BE AS GOOD
A PLACE TO START AS ANY.

200
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,662
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO CLEAN IT UP LATELY.

201
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,539
WHAT KINDA WORK DID YOU DO
BEFORE YOU CAME TO THIS COUNTRY?

202
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,841
I WAS A PRIEST.

203
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,609
A PRIEST?

204
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,478
YES.

205
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,347
WHAT KIND OF PRIEST?

206
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,748
SHAOLIN.

207
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,518
THAT IS
A BUDDHIST SECT.

208
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:35,662
LOOK, UH...
THAT CAN WAIT.

209
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,232
THE WORK?

210
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,767
I CAN GET IT LATER.

211
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,736
OH, NO,
I DON'T MIND.

212
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,611
YOU'RE A STRANGE MAN,
KWAI CHANG.

213
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,046
YES?

214
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,682
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME,
AND YET YOU DON'T MIND

215
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,517
DOING A DIRTY JOB LIKE--

216
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:02,789
OH, IT IS HONORABLE
WORK, DANIEL,
TO BE A FARMER.

217
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,657
EVEN A PIGSTY?

218
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,460
EVEN A PIGSTY.

219
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,270
DANIEL...

220
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,239
YES?

221
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,509
DO YOU KNOW
THERE ARE MEN
WATCHING THE FARM?

222
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:26,979
2 OF THEM.

223
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,616
THEY'VE BEEN THERE
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

224
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,184
NOW THERE ARE 3.

225
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,593
THEY MEAN YOU
NO GOOD.

226
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,833
THEY'RE NOT ON MY LAND.

227
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,501
BESIDES,
IT'S NO CRIME TO LOOK.

228
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,272
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY WANT?

229
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:54,507
I'M NO MIND READER.

230
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,843
BESIDES, I'VE GOT
OTHER THINGS
TO THINK ABOUT.

231
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,881
Young Caine:
YOU ONCE TOLD ME

232
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:05,418
MY PRESENT IS ROOTED
IN MY PAST.

233
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,587
AND IT IS THROUGH
THOSE ROOTS

234
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:12,392
WE DRAW
OUR NOURISHMENT
AND STRENGTH.

235
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:16,729
DO NOT THE ROOTS, THEN,
ALSO FORM THE FUTURE?

236
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:21,601
UPROOTED,
CAN A TREE FLOURISH
AND BEAR FRUIT?

237
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,405
WITHOUT THE FRUIT,

238
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:28,241
WHAT MAY BEAR THE SEEDS
OF FUTURE GENERATION

239
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:32,712
AND THUS FULFILL
THE ORDAINED CYCLE
OF ETERNITY?

240
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:37,450
THEN MY FUTURE
IS ROOTED IN MY PAST...

241
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:44,123
AND HALF MY ROOTS
ARE ACROSS THE SEA
IN AMERICA.

242
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,758
HOW WILL I FIND MY PLACE?

243
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:51,164
TIME AND YOUR TAO
WILL TELL YOU THAT,
GRASSHOPPER.

244
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,044
ANYTHING HAPPENING
DOWN THERE?

245
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,112
FARM WORK.

246
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,281
Forbes: HE KNOWS
WE'RE HERE.

247
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,984
I THINK IT'S TIME
WE PUSH HIM A LITTLE.

248
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,605
DANNY, WHAT ARE THEY
DOING UP THERE?

249
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,175
TARGET PRACTICE.
NO CONCERN TO US,

250
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,211
LONG AS THEY KEEP OFF
OUR PROPERTY.

251
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,534
DANNY...

252
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,905
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

253
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,039
WHO?

254
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,643
THOSE 3 MEN.
WHO ARE THEY?

255
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,912
I DON'T KNOW.

256
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,448
CAN'T WE MAKE THEM
GO AWAY?

257
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:16,349
HOW?

258
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,784
WE COULD NOTIFY
THE SHERIFF.

259
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,252
NO, ADA.

260
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,897
AH!

261
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,268
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

262
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:40,773
HERE...SIT.
EASY...EASY.

263
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,976
EASY, ADA.

264
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,979
IT'S GONNA BE
ALRIGHT.

265
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,349
JUST LAY BACK.
EASY.

266
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,751
COME ON.
IT'LL BE ALRIGHT.

267
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,290
EASY...EASY...

268
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,691
LISTEN...

269
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,993
IF THEY'RE STILL
THERE TOMORROW,

270
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,995
I'LL GO TALK
TO THEM, OKAY?

271
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:07,734
DANNY...
WHO ARE THEY?

272
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,101
I DON'T KNOW.

273
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:11,638
I HONESTLY
DON'T KNOW.

274
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,072
I'LL FIND OUT
TOMORROW.

275
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,547
OH...DANNY!

276
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:08,260
Forbes: AFTERNOON. MA'AM.

277
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,797
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND US
DROPPING BY.

278
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,666
YOUR FRIEND HERE
LOSE HIS WAY AGAIN,
DID HE?

279
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,669
NO, NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

280
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:19,338
MY ASSOCIATES...
MR. SLADE

281
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,940
AND MR. CURLY BILL
GRAHAM.

282
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,542
YEAH.

283
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,344
I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING YOU.

284
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,013
MUST BE ABOUT
2 YEARS NOW.

285
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,214
ALL OF THAT.

286
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,549
BEEN THROUGH
SO MANY TOWNS

287
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,452
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE NAMES,
ASKING ABOUT YOU.

288
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,021
ALWAYS HEARD THE SAME
STORY, MISTER, UH...

289
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,189
CAINE.
DANNY CAINE.

290
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,291
YEAH, WELL...

291
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,929
STORY GOES THAT YOU'RE
A PRETTY FAST GUN.

292
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,330
MAYBE THE FASTEST.

293
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,833
NO. YOU--YOU'VE
MADE A MISTAKE.

294
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:50,136
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'M HERE FOR...
CHECK THAT OUT.

295
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,371
YOU CAN
STOP CHECKING.

296
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:55,808
ONLY WEAPONS
I USE HERE ARE
A PLOW AND A HOE.

297
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,446
WASN'T ALWAYS
THAT WAY.

298
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:01,881
Forbes: I APPRECIATE
YOUR MODESTY, FRIEND,

299
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,886
BUT WHEN
OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS,

300
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:09,355
A WISE MAN'S
GOT TO LISTEN.

301
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,524
ALLOW ME TO BE
IMMODEST FOR A WHILE.

302
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:14,427
I THINK IT MIGHT SWEETEN
THINGS UP FOR A BIT.

303
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,764
MY TALENT...IS WORDS.

304
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:19,932
NEWSPRINT.

305
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,434
I CAN BUILD A LEGEND,

306
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:25,572
THE WAY NED BUNTLINE
DID FOR BUFFALO BILL.

307
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:28,207
IT CAN BE YOUR LEGEND,
OR, UH...

308
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:29,642
OR MINE.

309
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:34,080
ADA, GET BACK
ON THE PORCH.

310
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,685
AND THERE'S
A FORTUNE INVOLVED.

311
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,421
SO WE'VE COME HERE TO
OFFER YOU AN INVITATION...

312
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,757
TO MEET ME OVER IN MEDWICK.

313
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:47,794
YOU GOT THE WRONG
MAN, FRIEND.

314
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,663
AS I'VE TRIED
TO TELL YOU,
I'M JUST A FARMER.

315
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,199
HE DOESN'T EVEN
OWN A GUN.

316
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,499
I AM READY.

317
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,737
YAAAAAH!

318
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,742
YAAAAH!

319
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,551
YOW!

320
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:56,222
HAD YOU GOOD CAUSE
TO RISK THIS DANGER?

321
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:04,664
MY PURPOSE WAS
TO PROVE MY AGILITY...

322
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,165
AND MY COURAGE.

323
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:10,703
I HAD HOPED
SUCH QUALITIES
WERE ALREADY YOURS.

324
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,406
I SOUGHT TO TEST THEM.

325
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:18,277
FOR YOURSELF...
OR THEM?

326
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,617
IS IT NOT BETTER TO
SEE YOURSELF TRULY,

327
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:27,186
THAN CARE ABOUT
HOW OTHERS SEE YOU?

328
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:32,224
Young Caine:
IF I LOOK TRULY,
WILL I SEE TRULY?

329
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,298
I DON'T WANT THIS.

330
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,401
NOT THE RIGHT FEEL, HUH?

331
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,737
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

332
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,906
BUT YOU'D BEST
DIG OUT YOUR OWN.

333
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:49,608
HE HAS TOLD YOU
HE IS ONLY A FARMER.

334
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:52,144
WHO ASKED YOU, CHINAMAN?

335
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,680
PLEASE...LET HIM BE.

336
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,221
UNH! UNH!
OOH! UNH!

337
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:06,859
NOW HOLD ON, NOW,
CURLY BILL.

338
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,762
WE DON'T WANT
THE SHOWDOWN HERE...

339
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,964
AND CERTAINLY NOT
WITH THE CHORE BOY.

340
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:16,969
LISTEN...

341
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,606
THERE'S TO BE NO MORE
SHOOTING ON THAT HILL.

342
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:23,242
YOU CAN PUT AN END TO THAT
EASY ENOUGH, MISTER.

343
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:28,214
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU...
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

344
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,318
JUST DON'T MAKE IT
TOO LONG.

345
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:08,220
COULD'VE GOT YOURSELF
KILLED.

346
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:12,024
BUT I AM ALIVE.

347
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:15,795
IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF YOU GOT OUT OF HERE.

348
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,997
YOU WISH ME TO LEAVE?

349
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,131
YES.

350
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,934
IT'S NOT YOUR FIGHT.

351
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,376
DANNY!

352
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,780
HE ONLY WANTED
TO HELP.

353
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:35,982
I DON'T WANT
HIS HELP.

354
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,255
I'M GONNA DRIVE YOU
INTO TOWN.

355
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:17,589
THERE IS NO NEED TO.

356
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,026
I TOLD DANNY
WE OWED YOU THAT...

357
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,495
AND MUCH MORE.
HE AGREED.

358
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,470
I WOULD HAVE LIKED
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO HIM.

359
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,539
HE ASKED ME
TO SAY IT FOR HIM.

360
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,729
THEY ARE GONE.

361
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,431
OH.

362
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,768
WHAT DID THEY WANT?

363
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:04,904
I DON'T KNOW.

364
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,939
DID NOT DANNY
TELL YOU?

365
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:09,041
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

366
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:15,347
I WISH I COULD
HAVE COME TO KNOW
HIM BETTER.

367
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,850
I DON'T KNOW HIM
THAT WELL MYSELF.

368
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:21,653
I MEAN, WHAT HE DID
BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED.

369
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,655
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN MARRIED?

370
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:25,191
2 YEARS.

371
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,927
BUT HE DOESN'T TALK
ABOUT HIS PAST.

372
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:31,330
HE SAYS THE FUTURE
IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

373
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:32,932
IT IS CLEAR.

374
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:36,903
YOU HAVE A GREAT
LOVE BETWEEN YOU.

375
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:38,437
YOU ARE ONE.

376
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,409
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO CHANGE THAT...

377
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,944
EVER.

378
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,112
WHOA.

379
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:27,653
I'M SORRY YOU'RE
LEAVING, KWAI CHANG.

380
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,523
I WILL REMEMBER
YOU AND DANNY.

381
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,134
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

382
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,673
Ada: WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

383
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,641
WHERE'S
YOUR HUSBAND, MA'AM?

384
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,110
HE COME IN WITH YOU?

385
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:52,144
NO.

386
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:55,214
AND HE ISN'T COMING.
HE'S NO GUNFIGHTER.

387
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,217
I DON'T BELIEVE
THE LITTLE LADY KNOWS.

388
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:00,987
THAT MAN YOU'RE
TIED UP WITH...

389
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,854
HE'S JUST THIS SIDE
OF FAMOUS.

390
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,490
Forbes:
THAT'S A FACT, MA'AM.

391
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:07,693
HE'S RIGHT UP THERE
WITH JESSE JAMES
AND COLE YOUNGER.

392
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,829
Slade: HE DONE IT LEGAL,
OF COURSE--WITH A BADGE--

393
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,664
BUT HE'S A KILLER,
JUST THE SAME.

394
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,300
YOU'RE WRONG.

395
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,470
HE CAN TELL YOU.
HE'S HIS KIN.

396
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,943
LIKE A POLECAT IS
TO A HORSE.

397
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:28,114
Forbes:
EXACTLY HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND, MA'AM?

398
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,017
ENOUGH TO KNOW
HE'S NOT A KILLER.

399
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,684
SHOW HER THE PICTURE.

400
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,291
THIS IS HOW HE LOOKED
3 YEARS AGO,

401
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,893
BEFORE HE STARTED
SPORTING A MUSTACHE.

402
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,730
THEY'RE THE SAME MAN.
THIS WAS TAKEN...

403
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,567
RIGHT AFTER
HE GUNNED DOWN HOBIE DURANT
AND TWO OF HIS GANG.

404
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,901
IT'S JUST A PICTURE.

405
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,270
DOESN'T
PROVE ANYTHING.

406
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,639
Forbes: OH, MA'AM,
THIS LITTLE PICTURE

407
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,842
WAS TAKEN FROM THE FILES
OF THE BENSON GAZETTE,

408
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,211
A NEWSPAPER DOESN'T LIE.

409
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:04,350
PLEASE...
RELEASE THE HORSE.

410
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,091
WE AIN'T FINISHED
WITH HER YET.

411
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,692
LEAVE HIM ALONE, SLADE.

412
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,717
GO AHEAD, SLADE.
DRAW.

413
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:42,654
YOU ANGLING FOR A REPUTATION,
I'LL SEE YOU GET IT...

414
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:44,156
AS A PUNK!

415
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,360
STYLE AND CLASS
OF A PACK RAT!

416
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:50,196
I GOT AS MUCH CLASS
AS ANYBODY.

417
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:54,133
IN A STREET BRAWL
WITH A CHINESE FLUNKY?

418
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,703
YOU WANT RESPECT...

419
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,038
YOU EARN IT.

420
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,320
IS IT TRUE, DANNY?

421
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,522
ARE YOU
WHAT THEY SAID?

422
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:22,694
ADA, IF YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I AM BY NOW,
YOU NEVER WILL.

423
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,130
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

424
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,831
WHAT I HAVE TO.

425
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,635
NO!
I WANT YOU ALIVE!

426
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,537
ADA, I DON'T
WANNA GO.

427
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,004
THEN DON'T!

428
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:37,576
ADA, LISTEN...

429
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,780
I CAN'T LET THEM
COME OUT HERE AGAIN.

430
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,315
YOU COULD BE HURT.

431
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,717
DANNY,
I CAN'T LOSE YOU!

432
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:36,802
I THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

433
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:42,874
I WILL LEAVE WHEN WE
HAVE TALKED TOGETHER...

434
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,276
DANNY.

435
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:47,646
ABOUT WHAT?

436
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:49,381
YOU.

437
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:54,586
I KNEW YOU WOULD AGREE
TO MEET THIS MAN GRAHAM.

438
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,825
LIKE YOU KNEW THERE
WAS WATER UNDERGROUND?

439
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,765
AS I KNOW...YOU ARE
NOT MY BROTHER.

440
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,342
WHEN GRAHAM FLIPPED ME
THAT GUN,
AND I CAUGHT IT,

441
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,976
THAT'S WHAT TIPPED YOU,
WASN'T IT?

442
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:21,680
NO. I KNEW BEFORE.

443
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,884
WHEN YOU
RECEIVED ME,

444
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:28,387
IT WAS NOT...
AS A BROTHER.

445
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:34,326
IS MY BROTHER...
ALIVE?

446
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,161
I DON'T KNOW.

447
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:38,364
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

448
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:44,202
Master Kan: A PICTURE
OF THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.

449
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,539
NOW YOU WILL TEAR
YOUR PAPERS...THUS.

450
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,021
WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED,

451
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:06,892
YOU WILL REASSEMBLE
THE PIECES IN
THEIR PROPER PLACE.

452
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,340
MASTER KAN...

453
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:25,143
I HAVE FINISHED, MASTER.

454
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,945
SO SWIFTLY?

455
00:37:29,315 --> 00:37:33,985
IT IS CORRECT...
IN ALL RESPECTS.

456
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,654
HOW DID YOU DO IT,
MY SON?

457
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:38,189
IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT,
MASTER.

458
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,293
ON THE OTHER SIDE
WAS A PICTURE OF A MAN.

459
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,161
I PUT THE MAN TOGETHER,

460
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,864
AND THE WORLD WAS REMADE
AT THE SAME TIME.

461
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:49,368
THE MAN...THE WORLD.

462
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:53,004
THE WHOLENESS OF EACH
SEEMS RELATED.

463
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,541
AND ALL MEN
ADDED TOGETHER...

464
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,176
DO THEY NOT MAKE UP
THE WORLD WE LIVE IN?

465
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,779
Danny: WE MET
DURING THE WAR.

466
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,981
SERVED TOGETHER.

467
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,553
WE TALKED,
AS SOLDIERS DO
BETWEEN THE BATTLES,

468
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,755
WHEN THERE'S NOTHING
TO DO BUT WAIT.

469
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:13,492
HE TOLD ME ABOUT HIMSELF...
HIS FAMILY.

470
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,596
I LISTENED. REMEMBERED.

471
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,831
WHEN I WAS
MARSHAL OF BENSON,

472
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,166
DANNY CAME TO SEE ME...

473
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,202
ASKED ME TO HOLD
A PACKAGE FOR HIM.

474
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,204
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

475
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:29,575
6 MONTHS AT THE MOST,
HE SAID.

476
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,345
2 YEARS PASSED.
HE DIDN'T COME.

477
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:38,784
AND...YOU DID NOT
SEE HIM AGAIN?

478
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,186
AFTER THAT LAST GUNFIGHT
IN BENSON,

479
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:45,557
I--I JUST GOT SICK
OF THE KILLING.

480
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:49,761
I--I KNEW I COULDN'T
STAND THAT ANYMORE.

481
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:54,299
IT WASN'T A MATTER
OF UPHOLDING THE LAW,

482
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:58,069
IT WAS WHETHER
I WAS FAST ENOUGH...

483
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:02,240
OUTDRAW ALL THOSE
YOUNG BUCKS WHO KEPT
COMING TO TEST ME.

484
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:05,010
THAT BADGE I WORE,

485
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,480
IT'S BECOME A TARGET.

486
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:11,049
I HAD TO KILL
JUST TO STAY ALIVE.

487
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,421
SEE, DANNY HAD
GIVEN ME HIS PAST

488
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:17,623
AND A WHOLE NEW FUTURE...

489
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,394
EVEN THE DEED TO HIS FARM.

490
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:27,699
SO I TOOK IT.

491
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,134
I HAD TO.

492
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,873
AAAAAH!

493
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:11,242
HAPPY NEW YEAR,
HONORABLE DEMON.

494
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,779
WHY DO YOU NOT
TREMBLE BEFORE ME?

495
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,050
IS THE STUDENT CAINE,
THEN, SO FEARFUL?

496
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:21,487
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

497
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:26,892
YOUR CHI IS NOT THAT
OF A DEMON, KWAI CHANG,

498
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,827
ONLY A MASK.

499
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:31,162
THUS, WHILE YOU
APPEAR TO BE A DEMON,

500
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:35,333
YOUR INNER ENERGIES BETRAY
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

501
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,968
I SUPPOSE
THE TROUBLE IS,

502
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,004
I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO BE A DEMON.

503
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,274
AH. YOU HAVE HIT
ON A PROFOUND TRUTH.

504
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:47,212
CAN YOU NOT TELL ME
WHAT IT IS?

505
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,680
I MUST FIRST DECIDE

506
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:51,850
WHO AND WHAT
I WANT TO BE.

507
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:55,854
AND THEN, IN ORDER
TO ACHIEVE THAT IDEAL...

508
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,425
I MUST BECOME ONE
WITH IT.

509
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:04,329
POSSESS...AND BE
POSSESSED BY IT,

510
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,365
UNTIL YOU ARE
WHAT YOU WILL TO BE...

511
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,501
AND NOT MERELY A MASK,

512
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:12,103
ATTEMPTING TO DECEIVE
YOURSELF AND OTHERS.

513
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:16,474
Caine: DANNY
GAVE YOU A MASK

514
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:20,078
BEHIND WHICH
TO REBUILD A LIFE.

515
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,714
I THINK HE WOULD'VE
UNDERSTOOD THAT, TOO.

516
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:26,484
IF YOU GO AGAINST
THIS GUNMAN,

517
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:29,521
WILL YOU NOT
BE REVEALED?

518
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:32,090
WILL YOU NOT
LOSE ALL YOU
HAVE WORKED FOR?

519
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,695
AND WILL NOT
THE TESTING GO ON?

520
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:40,165
YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO BURY
LIGHTNING LUKE...

521
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,401
I THOUGHT I HAD.

522
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,936
AND SOME YOUNG BUCK
COMES ALONG

523
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,172
TRYING TO DIG HIM UP
AND KILL HIM AGAIN.

524
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:52,343
YOU HAVE NOT
TOUCHED YOUR GUN
FOR A LONG TIME.

525
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,380
THE LIGHTNING MAY BE
GONE FROM IT.

526
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,915
YOU MAY DIE.

527
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:00,285
I'VE NEVER BEEN
AFRAID OF DYING...

528
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,820
ONLY LIVING IN HELL,

529
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,955
BEING HUNTED AND HOUNDED.

530
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,925
THE LIFE OF A FARMER
IS GOOD...

531
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:11,496
HELPING THE EARTH
TO BRING FORTH FRUIT.

532
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:12,898
I KNOW.

533
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,134
YOU CANNOT GO.

534
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,139
WHY SHOULD IT
MATTER TO YOU?

535
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,775
I AM NOT YOUR BROTHER.

536
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,076
LUKE!

537
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,782
Slade: LIGHTNING LUKE.

538
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,052
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY
THEY CALL YOU THAT.

539
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,854
YOU GONNA SHOW ME?

540
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:38,256
WITH A GUN
IN YOUR HAND
ALREADY, SON?

541
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,664
WELL, NOW,
THE WAY I HEARD,

542
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:48,299
A MAN NEEDS
A LITTLE EDGE AGAINST YOU.

543
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,268
HE DOES NOT WISH
TO FIGHT.

544
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,771
HE'S GOT A CROWN
ON HIS HEAD.

545
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,808
IT'S GONNA FALL
TO THE MAN WHO TAKES HIM,

546
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,010
AND THAT MAN'S
GONNA BE ME.

547
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:46,858
DANNY! OH...DANNY.

548
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:49,394
IT ISN'T FINISHED.
THERE'S STILL
CURLY BILL.

549
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,495
BUT YOU CAN'T!

550
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,130
I HAVE TO.

551
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,466
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

552
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,435
MEET HIM.

553
00:43:57,502 --> 00:43:58,536
WOUNDED?

554
00:43:58,603 --> 00:43:59,771
I'LL MAKE IT.

555
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,640
HE WILL NOT MEET YOU.

556
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,509
HE WISHES YOUR CROWN.

557
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:07,612
HE WILL WAIT
UNTIL YOU ARE READY.

558
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,414
IS THIS NOT THE CODE?

559
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:19,424
TAKE HIM.

560
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,225
FORBES...

561
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:57,829
I'M TIRED
OF WAITING.

562
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:09,908
MR. GRAHAM.

563
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:13,478
WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?

564
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,480
THE LUKE HASKELL
YOU SEEK...

565
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,715
IS NO MORE.

566
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:20,318
I'LL FIND HIM.

567
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,352
NO.

568
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,654
CURLY BILL...

569
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,989
HE'S OVER THERE.

570
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:54,412
AAH!

571
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:06,024
TWO GUNS AGAINST
A CHORE BOY WITH
A PLOWSHARE.

572
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,867
WHAT DO THEY SAY WHEN
A MAN IS FINISHED?

573
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:19,104
HE THREW IN HIS HAND?

574
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,406
WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE DID.

575
00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:01,612
IT'S OVER, DANNY.

576
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:04,115
IS IT?

577
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:06,484
LUKE HASKELL
IS DEAD.

578
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:11,756
NOT BEFORE HE KILLED
ANOTHER MAN.

579
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,959
HE WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU.

580
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:18,964
YEAH, THERE IS
ALWAYS THAT.

581
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:25,937
NO...THIS WAS
THE LAST ONE.

582
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:29,707
IF ANYONE ELSE
COMES LOOKING FOR ME,
THEY'LL--

583
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:31,409
NO ONE ELSE WILL COME.

584
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,483
YOU KNOW, WHEN--
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU,

585
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:44,422
I THOUGHT, "MY BROTHER,
MY EXECUTIONER."

586
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:48,526
AND NOW?

587
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:52,830
AND NOW,
KWAI CHANG, I--

588
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:55,033
I'D LIKE TO THINK
WE ARE BROTHERS.

589
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,205
WE ARE.
