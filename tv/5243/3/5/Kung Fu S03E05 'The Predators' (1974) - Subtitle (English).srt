1
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,143
Man: HEY, HERE'S SOME
FRESH TRACKS.

2
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,478
THEY'RE HEADING
THAT WAY. COME ON!

3
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,719
HEY, HOLD UP, BOYS.

4
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,587
Man: FIND HIM YET?

5
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:54,822
WHERE?

6
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,060
I FOUND SOMETHING.

7
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,597
SOME KIND OF SCALP.

8
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,766
THAT AIN'T HIM.

9
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,000
HE AIN'T APACHE.

10
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,403
I DON'T EVEN THINK
HE'S AN INDIAN.

11
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,073
WELL, HE'S A BREED.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

12
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:15,876
CHINESE.

13
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,811
HEY, BACK TO TOWN!

14
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:26,454
YOU KNOW, BREED,
YOU CAN GET SCALPED
IN THESE MOUNTAINS?

15
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,724
NOW, WHERE'S
THAT APACHE HIDDEN?

16
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,927
APACHE?

17
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,264
PARTNER OF THE ONE
WE SHOT.

18
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,098
HIS TRAIL RAN OUT
DOWN THERE BY THE ROCK,

19
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,667
SO HE GOTTA BE IN HERE.

20
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,336
AND YOU GOTTA
KNOW WHERE.

21
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,642
I AIN'T GONNA
ASK YOU AGAIN.

22
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,702
Master Kan: YOUR TREAD
MUST BE LIGHT AND SURE,

23
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,171
AS THOUGH YOUR PATH
WERE UPON RICE PAPER.

24
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:57,511
IT IS SAID A SHAOLIN PRIEST
CAN WALK THROUGH WALLS.

25
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,181
LOOK FOR, HE CANNOT BE SEEN.

26
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:04,352
LISTENED FOR,
HE CANNOT BE HEARD.

27
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,555
TOUCHED, HE CANNOT BE FELT.

28
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,624
THIS RICE PAPER IS THE TEST.

29
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,694
FRAGILE AS THE WINGS
OF THE DRAGONFLY.

30
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,497
CLINGING AS A COCOON
OF THE SILKWORM.

31
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:21,835
WHEN YOU CAN WALK ITS LENGTH
AND LEAVE NO TRACE,

32
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,971
YOU WILL HAVE LEARNED.

33
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,417
THIS IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE, BREED.

34
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,887
I SEE NO APACHE.

35
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:47,928
BOO!

36
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,239
OK, BOYS, COME ON.
WE'RE JUST STANDING AROUND HERE,

37
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,108
AND THAT APACHE'S
GAINING GROUND.

38
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,676
LET'S MOVE!

39
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,280
YOUR SKIN IS NOT
LIKE THEIRS.

40
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,585
I AM FROM CHINA.

41
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,287
I HAVE SEEN OTHERS
FROM THAT LAND.

42
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:48,922
YOU ARE DIFFERENT.

43
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,460
MY FATHER WAS FROM HERE.

44
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,528
HE WAS A WHITE MAN?

45
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,096
YES.

46
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,765
NO.

47
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,700
YES, IT IS SO.

48
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,372
HE WOULD NOT HAVE STOOD
BEFORE A GUN FOR ME.

49
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:06,474
YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT.

50
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,177
I KNOW WHITE MEN.

51
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,614
THERE IS NO WHITE
IN YOU.

52
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,784
IT IS NOT THERE.

53
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,553
HOSKAY GREETS YOU
AS A BROTHER.

54
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,257
I ASK YOU
AS A BROTHER.

55
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,693
STAND WITH ME.

56
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,160
TAKE UP THE CAUSE
OF JUSTICE.

57
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,196
WE SHALL TRIUMPH
OVER THE MANDARINS

58
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,398
AND THE PEOPLE
SHALL BE FREE!

59
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:34,868
YOUR WORDS ARE VAIN,
TEH-SOONG.

60
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,405
Teh-Soong: LISTEN TO ME,
HEAR ME, MY BROTHERS!

61
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,407
ALL MY BROTHERS,
HEAR ME!

62
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,108
THIS IS A HOLY CAUSE!

63
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,543
VICTORY AWAITS US.

64
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,212
WE STAND TOGETHER,
VICTORY, TRIUMPH!

65
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,279
Young Caine: MASTER?

66
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,315
YOU DO NOT INTRUDE.

67
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,518
COME. SPEAK.

68
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,952
Teh-Soong:
WE WILL PREVAIL!

69
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,488
PLEDGE WITH ME.
PICK UP THIS HOLY CAUSE--

70
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,691
I HAVE LONG ADMIRED
OUR BROTHER TEH-SOONG.

71
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,494
THERE IS MUCH IN HIM
TO BE ADMIRED.

72
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:04,131
I FEAR HE GROWS
APART FROM US.

73
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,400
FROM OUR WAY.

74
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,537
HE IS FIRED BY
A DEEP CONVICTION.

75
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,975
WOULD YOU HAVE HIM
DENY THIS TRUTH...

76
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,578
HE FEELS SO DEEPLY?

77
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,346
BUT IF WE ARE BROTHERS,

78
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:23,283
SHOULD NOT OUR BELIEFS
BE ONE?

79
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,485
THAT IS WHAT
TEH-SOONG

80
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:27,087
DESIRES MOST
FERVENTLY.

81
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,424
HE WOULD HAVE US
DENY OUR TRUTH

82
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,926
AND ACCEPT HIS.

83
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,995
WHO IS RIGHT?

84
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,332
THERE CAN BE NO WAY
BUT THE WAY OF THE TAO.

85
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,435
SO WE BELIEVE.

86
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,004
WHAT THEN?

87
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:48,008
DO WE RENOUNCE
TEH-SOONG
AS OUR BROTHER?

88
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:54,715
MASTER? WHEREIN
DOES BROTHERHOOD LIE?

89
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:02,355
YOUR QUESTION IS
MOST WORTH ASKING.

90
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,826
MOST WORTH
CONSIDERING.

91
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:16,804
BEFORE MY 12th SUMMER,
I WENT ON A HIGH HILL.

92
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,440
I FASTED FOR DAYS
AND NIGHTS.

93
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:23,176
A VISION CAME TO ME.

94
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,714
I SAT ON A GRAY HORSE,
I RODE OVER THE CLOUDS,

95
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,717
AND MY BROTHER RODE
BEHIND ME.

96
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,152
WHITE MEN FELL
FROM THE CLOUDS

97
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,654
INTO THE DARKNESS.

98
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:37,925
AND THEIR BULLETS
DID NOT STRIKE US.

99
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,765
IT WAS...TO BE THAT WAY.

100
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:52,105
BUT MY BROTHER RIDES
NO MORE.

101
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:58,111
HIS SCALP HANGS IN
THE WHITE MAN'S CAMP.

102
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,048
SCALP HUNTERS.

103
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:04,652
THEY HUNT APACHE SCALPS.

104
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,989
THERE IS ONE CALLED RAFE.

105
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:12,325
THEIR LEADER.

106
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,862
I MUST KILL HIM FIRST.

107
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,068
YOU WILL ANSWER DEATH
WITH DEATH?

108
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:24,672
IT IS THE MISSION
FOR WHICH THE SPIRITS
CHOSE ME,

109
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,808
MY BROTHER, ALL HIS
FALLEN BROTHERS.

110
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,243
I MUST AVENGE THEM.

111
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,958
MASTER?

112
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,096
TEH-SOONG IS READY
TO LEAVE.

113
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,864
LET HIM ENTER.

114
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,978
YOU WILL NOT
BE DISSUADED?

115
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,146
NEVER.

116
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,849
I WILL NOT WASTE
ANOTHER DAY WITHIN
THESE WALLS.

117
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,550
WASTE?

118
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,452
THE PEOPLE
ARE LIKE SLAVES.

119
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,522
THEY STARVE, AND STILL
THE MANDARINS

120
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,324
DEMAND TRIBUTE
FOR THE EMPEROR.

121
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,962
WE PRAY.
WE MEDITATE. WE--

122
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,563
WE DO NOTHING.

123
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,798
HOW CAN YOU GO
ON BEING BLIND

124
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,334
TO THE MISERY
AROUND YOU?

125
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,335
I SEE IT.

126
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,203
AND DO NOTHING.

127
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,372
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

128
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,607
EVERYTHING!

129
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,208
I WILL TAKE
UP THE CAUSE
OF THE PEOPLE.

130
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,076
I WILL LEAD THEM.

131
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,646
SPEAK FOR THEM.
FIGHT FOR THEM.

132
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,649
AN AWESOME TASK.

133
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,550
YOU WILL BE
IN OUR THOUGHTS.

134
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:47,087
ALL HAS BEEN SAID.

135
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,056
WE WISH YOU LIFE.

136
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:57,064
HE WAS TAUGHT
TO BE ONE
WITH THE TAO.

137
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,501
TO FLOW. NOW HE STANDS
AGAINST THE CURRENT.

138
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:05,172
HE BELIEVES IT IS
THE WILL OF DESTINY.

139
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,606
COULD IT BE SO?

140
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:09,476
CAN ANY MAN
BE ASKED

141
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,244
TO BE MORE
THAN A MAN?

142
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,370
WELL, WOULD YOU LOOK
AT WHAT'S FALLEN
IN ON US?

143
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,241
EASY BOYS, EASY.

144
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,710
NOW, MAYBE HE JUST CAUGHT WIND
OF THAT APACHE.

145
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,212
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
HERE TO TELL US?

146
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,882
I CAME TO TELL YOU
NOTHING.

147
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,416
I AM LOOKING FOR RAFE.

148
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,921
RAFE WHO?

149
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,656
AIN'T NO ONE AROUND HERE
BY THE NAME RAFE.

150
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,859
Man: YOU'RE ALL
MIXED UP, BOY.

151
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,128
WHAT YOU CALL YOURSELF,
CHINAMAN?

152
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,931
I AM CAINE.

153
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,572
YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU WAS.

154
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,841
HOW COME YOUR NECK
AIN'T BROKE?

155
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,076
I WAS NOT HANGED.

156
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,410
WELL, THEY WAS FIXING
THE GALLOW

157
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,979
WHEN I WAS RIDING OUT.

158
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,747
WHAT MADE THEM CHANGE
THEIR MINDS?

159
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,349
I DID NOT CHOOSE
TO STAY.

160
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,885
YEAH?

161
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:01,021
THIS HEATHEN'S WANTED
BACK IN TEMESCAL.

162
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,155
WHAT FOR?

163
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,825
PUTTING A KNIFE
THROUGH SHERIFF AMES.

164
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,126
ALL THE WAY THROUGH?

165
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,394
FAR ENOUGH.

166
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,497
WELL, THAT'S
THE BEST NEWS I HEARD
IN A LONG TIME.

167
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,801
YOU WERE THERE.
YOU SAW.

168
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:14,935
YOU KNOW IT WAS
ANOTHER MAN

169
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,403
WHO KILLED
THE SHERIFF.

170
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:20,740
YEAH. AND I KNOW
WHO IT WAS.

171
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:21,942
BAILEY SEWARD.

172
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,112
THEN YOU WILL GO
BACK WITH ME,

173
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,679
AND TELL THIS
TO THE JUDGE?

174
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,450
UH, NO, HALF-BREED.
THAT'S NOT WHAT

175
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,752
YOU'D CALL
A PRACTICAL IDEA.

176
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,921
YOU SEE, THIS
BAILEY SEWARD

177
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,055
WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT,

178
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,858
UH, HE'S THE MAN
WE WORK FOR,

179
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,159
AND IT JUST DON'T
MAKE SENSE

180
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,429
TO, UH, CHOP OFF
THE HAND THAT PAYS YOU,

181
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,397
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

182
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,799
IF YOU DO NOT
COME BACK

183
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,935
AND TELL THE TRUTH,

184
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,203
JUSTICE WILL NOT
BE SERVED.

185
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,604
WELL.

186
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:55,909
NOW THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE ME
A FRIGHTFUL LACK OF SLEEP.

187
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:56,910
YOU GOT YOUR ANSWER,
BREED.

188
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,712
WHAT YOU WAITING ON?

189
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,548
I WILL NOT LEAVE
WITHOUT YOU.

190
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,618
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING,
CHINAMAN?

191
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,121
YOU'RE A REAL
CAUTION.

192
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:11,058
I DON'T THINK HE
KNOWS WHAT WE DO
FOR A LIVING.

193
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,127
YOU KILL MEN.

194
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,998
WE COLLECT SCALPS
FOR A BOUNTY.

195
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,567
AND MEN DIE.

196
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,170
APACHES DIE.

197
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:28,041
YOU KILL INNOCENT
MEN FOR PROFIT.

198
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,943
THERE IS NO
GREATER EVIL.

199
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,015
Man: HEY, YOU
KNOW SOMETHING,
BREED?

200
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,484
I THINK YOU JUST
BIT IT OFF.

201
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,421
YOU KNOW, KIRBY HERE
HAD A NOTION

202
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,557
THAT, UH, HIS SCALP
WOULDN'T GO MUCH
NOTICED

203
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,725
THEN WITH ALL
THEM OTHERS.

204
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,227
THAT SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT.

205
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,429
IT'LL MAKE UP
FOR THE ONE
THAT GOT PAST US.

206
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,469
WHAT, UH, WHAT DO YOU
SMOKE IN THIS THING?

207
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,307
I DO NOT SMOKE IT.

208
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:05,545
WELL, IT SURE IS
A FUNNY-LOOKING BANJO.

209
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:10,483
GIVE US, UM,
TEXAS LULLABY.

210
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,486
WHAT IS THAT?

211
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,822
THAT'S MUSIC.

212
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,690
IT'S THE ONLY KIND
WORTH LISTENING TO.

213
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,993
HEY, ANSEL, COME ON,
TICKLE SOMETHING OUT OF THAT.

214
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,794
YEAH, GO ON, ANSEL.

215
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,635
COME ON, ANSEL!

216
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,406
ALRIGHT, NOW
HOLD IT, BOYS.

217
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,641
SOMETHING'S GOING
TO HAPPEN.

218
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,714
ATTABOY, ANSEL!
PLAYS THAT BEAUTIFUL.

219
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,441
Young Caine: MASTER, WHEREIN
DOES BROTHERHOOD LIE?

220
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,478
Master Po: YOUR QUESTION
IS MOST WORTH ASKING.

221
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,615
MOST WORTH CONSIDERING.

222
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,486
Rafe: HEY, HEATHEN.

223
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,522
I WANT YOU TO MEET
SOMEONE.

224
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,025
NAME'S MUTALA.

225
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,493
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE WOULD HAVE DONE

226
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,061
WITHOUT HIM.

227
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,304
IF, UH, YOU GOT
SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO SAY TO HIM,

228
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,973
JUST, UH, SPEAK
RIGHT UP.

229
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,986
LET ME TAKE THOSE
FROM YOU, CHINEY.

230
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,988
I'LL TAKE REAL GOOD
CARE OF THEM.

231
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,363
HE KNOWS WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,
CHINAMAN.

232
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,699
HE DON'T LIKE IT.

233
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:07,867
UH-OH.

234
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,737
WELL, LOOK AT IT
THIS WAY, CHINAMAN.

235
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,305
YOU WERE QUITS
ANYWAY.

236
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,845
COME ON, MU!
COME ON, BOY!

237
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,020
CUT HIS EARS OFF!

238
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,122
COME ON,
GET HIM, MUTALA!

239
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,466
PRETTY GOOD, CHINEY.

240
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,270
STICK IT
IN HIS EAR!

241
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,483
GIVE HIM A BLOW
UPSIDE THE HEAD!

242
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,055
CUT HIS FACE!

243
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,459
GET HIM!

244
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,354
Ansel: RAFE! WATCH OUT!

245
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,387
NO, DON'T SHOOT!
YOU'RE LIABLE TO HIT RAFE.

246
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,292
RAFE! GET
OUT OF THE WAY!

247
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,164
COME ON, LET'S GET
DOWN THERE!

248
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,358
AAH!

249
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,263
HYAH.

250
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,530
THE SOLDIERS.

251
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,266
I COULD NOT STOP
THEM ALL.

252
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,869
THERE WERE
SO MANY OF THEM.

253
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,881
BATHE HIM.
TEND TO HIS WOUNDS.

254
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,683
CALL MASTER LI NU.

255
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,592
HE WAS BESET
BY SOLDIERS.

256
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,428
YES. THE WORD CAME
WHILE WE WERE EATING.

257
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,631
HE LED A REVOLT
IN A VILLAGE TO THE NORTH.

258
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,666
NOW THE VILLAGE
IS DESTROYED

259
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:17,003
AND TEH-SOONG IS MARKED
FOR DEATH.

260
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,705
WILL HE BE SAFE
HERE?

261
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:19,672
YES.

262
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,008
BUT WILL HE
BE CONTENT TO STAY?

263
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,588
IS YOUR BROTHER
AVENGED?

264
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:38,124
DIE OF YOUR WOUND,
WHO WILL AVENGE YOU?

265
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,593
OTHERS WILL FOLLOW.

266
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,495
TO LEAVE THEIR
SCALPS ON HIS LINE?

267
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,198
WHERE WILL
IT ALL END?

268
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:50,403
WHEN HE AND ALL LIKE HIM
ARE DEAD.

269
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,872
IT IS YOU WHO
WILL DIE IF
THE OTHERS RETURN.

270
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,209
WHERE IS YOUR LODGE?

271
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,581
A DAY'S RIDE.

272
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:03,716
WHERE THE CANYON BEGINS.

273
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,156
I NEVER SEEN
YOU SO INTENT.

274
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,559
THE WAY HE LOOKED AT ME.

275
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,563
WELL, YOU GET US
ANOTHER SHOT
AT HIM, OK?

276
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,567
THE RIVER WILL BRING
HIM OUT ABOVE THE CANYON.

277
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:24,003
HE MUST GO DOWN
INTO THE CANYON TO CROSS.

278
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,606
3 DAY'S JOURNEY ON FOOT.

279
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:30,710
YEAH. WE CAN COUNT
ON RAFE TO SLOW
HIM DOWN A BIT.

280
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,645
ANY OTHER WAY
OUT OF THAT CANYON?

281
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,081
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.

282
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,015
THEN WE GOT HIM.

283
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,684
LET HIM LAY,
CHINAMAN.

284
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,852
ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER
HE'S DEAD.

285
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,088
YOU TRY
TO TAKE HIM
OUT OF HERE,

286
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,956
YOU'RE DEAD,
TOO.

287
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,492
HE'LL SLOW
YOU DOWN.

288
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,462
WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?

289
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,798
I'M THINKIN'
ABOUT MY
OWN NECK.

290
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,833
YOU GOT
ME LYIN'
HELPLESS.

291
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:58,337
MINUTE YOU TURN AROUND,
HE STICKS A KNIFE IN ME.

292
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,508
YOU'LL NEVER
GET ME
TO TEMESCAL.

293
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:03,643
THERE WILL BE
NO KILLING.

294
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,578
I MUST HAVE
YOUR WORD.

295
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,014
IT IS MY MISSION.

296
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,749
IT IS YOUR BURDEN.

297
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,820
YOU CALLED ME
BROTHER.

298
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,221
I ASK YOU
AS A BROTHER.

299
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:18,457
NO, I CANNOT.

300
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,292
YOUR WORD.

301
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,235
NO KILLING...FOR NOW.

302
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,237
I PROMISE NO MORE.

303
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,978
YOU ARE BOUND.

304
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:02,401
WE CANNOT DELAY.

305
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,803
I'M READY.

306
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:18,150
MORE PAIN?

307
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,620
MY PAIN IS
FOR MY BROTHERS.

308
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:30,429
WHAT'S YOUR
PLAN, HEATHEN?

309
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,799
IT HAS NOT CHANGED.

310
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,534
WE RETURN TO TEMESCAL.

311
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:38,104
WHATEVER YOU
SAY.

312
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,171
YOU FIGURE YOU
CAN FIND

313
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,207
YOUR WAY OUT
OF HERE, HUH?

314
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,710
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

315
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:46,713
THE WAY OUT IS THE WAY IN.

316
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:50,149
NOW, THAT'S A FACT.

317
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,183
GET UP.

318
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,087
NOW, HOW AM
I GONNA DO THAT?

319
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,724
YOU GOT ME LASHED
HERE LIKE I WAS
FIXED FOR BRANDIN'.

320
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,093
YOU ARE UNTIED.

321
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,162
WHEN YOU REGAIN YOUR
STRENGTH, YOU FEED YOURSELF.

322
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,597
HUH?

323
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,501
HEY.

324
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,903
AIN'T THAT
SOMETHIN'?

325
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:16,943
IF I TIE YOU
TO THIS HORSE,

326
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,978
YOU WILL BE MOST
UNCOMFORTABLE.

327
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,550
IF YOU SWEAR NOT
TO TRY TO RUN AWAY,

328
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,218
I WILL CAST THIS
ROPE ASIDE.

329
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,754
WHAT DO I SWEAR ON?

330
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,090
ONLY GIVE ME YOUR
HONOR AS A MAN.

331
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:33,660
SURE.

332
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,194
I'LL GIVE YOU
MY WORD.

333
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,703
MY WORD AIN'T WORTH
NOTHIN', CHINAMAN.

334
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,672
WHAT YOU THINK
OF THAT?

335
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,974
YOU ARE WITHOUT HONOR?

336
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,175
UH-HUH.

337
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:05,091
HOW DOES TEH-SOONG
PROGRESS?

338
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,893
HIS WOUNDS COOL.

339
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,895
HIS ANGER DOES NOT.

340
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,163
HE SPEAKS
AGAINST YOU, MASTER.

341
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,699
I KNOW.

342
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,601
HE HAS DONE SO
TO MY FACE.

343
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:18,470
I HAVE LOST
ALL RESPECT FOR HIM.

344
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:22,008
THE SAGE SAYS, "A
SOUND MAN'S HEART

345
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,711
"IS NOT SHUT
WITHIN ITSELF,

346
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:29,749
BUT IT IS OPEN
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S
HEARTS."

347
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,951
TEH-SOONG ACCEPTS
YOUR KINDNESS,

348
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:33,920
AND AT THE SAME TIME
DEFIES YOU.

349
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,889
WOULD YOU HAVE HIM
HIDE HIS DEFIANCE?

350
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:40,159
IS THERE HONOR
IN SUCH DECEPTION?

351
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,463
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR THOUGHTS, MASTER.

352
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,066
BUT WHAT?

353
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,802
THIS PARTICULAR VIRTUE
YOU FIND IN TEH-SOONG,

354
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,138
IS IT MOST LIMITING?

355
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,406
STILL IT IS THERE,

356
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,876
AND IT IS FOR US
TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

357
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:04,616
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HONOR IS.

358
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,685
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT.

359
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:10,022
COME.
I WILL HELP YOU UP.

360
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,323
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA RIDE?

361
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,325
I WILL WALK.

362
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,928
WELL, SUITS ME.

363
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,997
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

364
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:28,875
UHH.

365
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,743
I'LL TELL YOU...

366
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,245
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD,
CHINAMAN.

367
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:41,788
YOU, UH, WANNA TAKE
MY WORD AGAIN?

368
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,909
HEY. WAIT A MINUTE,
HEATHEN.

369
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,844
I WANT THAT APACHE
WHERE I CAN SEE HIM.

370
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,947
HE HAS GIVEN HIS WORD.

371
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:09,816
YOU BELIEVE THAT?

372
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,984
HIS WORD'S NO BETTER
THAN MINE.

373
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,186
JUMP ME THE FIRST
CHANCE HE GETS.

374
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,355
ONLY IF YOU BREAK
YOUR WORD.

375
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,758
CHINAMAN,
HE'S AN APACHE!

376
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,293
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND THEM.

377
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,729
I KNOW MEN.

378
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:25,832
I TRUST THIS ONE.

379
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:28,467
AND WITH HIM,
I TRUST YOU.

380
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:50,789
HORSES.

381
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:53,159
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE
THEY'RE NOT OURS?

382
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,461
WE JUST RODE THROUGH
HERE A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

383
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,330
NO. TRACKS
ARE FRESH.

384
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,300
I NEVER FIGURED
THAT CHINAMAN WOULD
HAVE HORSES HID.

385
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,203
RIGHT HERE.

386
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:13,212
BLOOD.

387
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,115
THAT'S THAT
CHINAMAN'S BLOOD.

388
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:18,284
YEAH. WELL, I WOULDN'T
BE TOO SURE.

389
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,020
WELL, I AIN'T EVER
SEEN NOBODY GET
THE BEST OF RAFE YET.

390
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:24,590
NOW, LOOK. IF HE HAD WON,
WHY WOULD HE BE SITTIN'
HERE WAITIN' FOR US?

391
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,325
Mutala: 3 MEN
FIGHT HERE.

392
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,301
THE APACHE.

393
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,436
THAT'S THE ONE
THAT GOT AWAY.

394
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,171
YEAH.

395
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,740
WELL, IT ALL WON'T
BE FOR NOTHING.

396
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,409
WE'RE GONNA GET
THAT SCALP YET.

397
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,111
HOW LONG AGO THEY LEAVE?

398
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,146
NOT LONG.
WE CATCH 'EM.

399
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,848
WHOA. WHOA. WAIT. WHOA.

400
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:51,984
WE'RE LIABLE TO LOSE THEM
BECAUSE OF THE DARK,

401
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:55,287
BUT THEY GOTTA CLIMB
OUT OF THAT CANYON.

402
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,388
WHEN THEY DO...

403
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,858
WE'RE GONNA BE WAITING
FOR THEM RIGHT THERE.

404
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:01,260
IT WILL BE DARK SOON.

405
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:04,563
DARK OR LIGHT. DON'T MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE TO MUTALA.

406
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,865
HE'LL FIND A TRAIL
BLINDFOLDED.

407
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:09,001
COUNT THE MINUTES, HEATHEN.

408
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,418
HEY, WHY DON'T
YOU SAVE SOME
OF THAT?

409
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:29,788
WE'LL GET MORE.

410
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,457
YEAH? WHERE?

411
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,327
I WILL FIND SOME.

412
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,564
YOU MEAN YOU'RE GONNA WALK OUT
OF HERE AND LEAVE US?

413
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,900
YES.

414
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:45,904
JUST WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M GONNA BE HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK?

415
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:48,874
I HAVE YOUR PROMISE.

416
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:52,211
I TOLD YOU, CHINAMAN,
MY PROMISE DON'T MEAN NOTHIN'.

417
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,184
THEN YOU FORCE ME
TO TIE YOU.

418
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,787
OK.

419
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,991
YOU CAN SURE
COME AHEAD
AND TRY.

420
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,293
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING,
CHINAMAN.

421
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,895
I AIN'T
HALF DROWNED NOW.

422
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,965
YOU MIGHT
WANNA KEEP
THAT IN MIND.

423
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,600
GO AHEAD.

424
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,402
LET YOU TAKE
THE FIRST SWING.

425
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,779
Jess: ANY CHANCE
THEY GOT HERE
'FORE US?

426
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,548
NO.

427
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,253
YOU REALLY WANT THAT
CHINAMAN, DON'T YOU?

428
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,688
HE PASSED
JUDGMENT ON ME.

429
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,590
OH, NO DENYIN' THAT.

430
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,259
I SEEN IT
IN HIS EYES.

431
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:45,131
HE DOES NOT KNOW
WHAT THE APACHE DID
TO MY PEOPLE.

432
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:48,767
I RECKON YOU BETTER
TEACH HIM A LESSON,
HUH?

433
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,336
HE WILL REMEMBER.

434
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,776
HEY, INJUN.

435
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:01,180
YOU KNOW MY MEN ARE
GONNA COME RIDIN'
IN HERE ANY MINUTE.

436
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:02,981
CHINAMAN
KNOWS IT, TOO.

437
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,151
THAT'S HOW COME
HE TOOK OFF.

438
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:06,585
AND HE AIN'T
COMIN' BACK,

439
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:10,356
SO, UH, WHY DON'T
YOU AND ME MAKE
A DEAL, HUH?

440
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,824
YOU CUT ME LOOSE,
YOU GO YOUR WAY,
I GO MINE.

441
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,493
I KEEP MY MEN
FROM CHASING YOU.

442
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,262
HUH?

443
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,331
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN IF THEY
FIND US LIKE THIS.

444
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:24,603
YOUR HANDS ARE RED
WITH APACHE BLOOD.

445
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,005
AHH.

446
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,207
IT'S OUR LIVIN'.

447
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:31,610
YOU THIRST NOT FOR WATER,
BUT FOR BLOOD.

448
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:35,514
I'D SETTLE
FOR WATER RIGHT NOW.

449
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:37,383
SCALP HUNTER.

450
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,286
WE LEARNED
FROM EXPERTS.

451
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,156
APACHES NEVER KILL
FOR MONEY.

452
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:47,993
WELL, YOU TAKE
THE GLORY, INJUN,

453
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,628
AND I'LL SETTLE
FOR THE CASH.

454
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,616
I GAVE HIM MY WORD.

455
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,152
Caine: AND YOU
KEPT IT.

456
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:18,190
I WILL KILL HIM YET.

457
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,029
PARASITES.

458
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,697
LEECHES.

459
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,399
HAVE YOU NO FEELING?

460
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:28,467
NO PASSION?

461
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,737
LEAVE HERE.

462
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,205
COME WITH ME.

463
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:34,806
TOGETHER WE CAN BRING
JUSTICE TO THE PEOPLE.

464
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,375
HOW?

465
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:38,577
WE'LL LEAD THEM
AGAINST THE MANDARINS
AND THE SOLDIERS.

466
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:41,147
WE WILL KILL THEM ALL.

467
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:43,815
VIOLENCE GIVES RISE
TO VIOLENCE,

468
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,584
NOT TO JUSTICE.

469
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,554
YOU'VE JUST SEEN
THAT FOR YOURSELF,
TEH-SOONG.

470
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,789
MY BELIEF HAS ONLY
BEEN STRENGTHENED.

471
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:53,024
MY ANGER SHARPENED.

472
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,660
WILL YOU COME?

473
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:16,548
Young Caine: MASTER, WHEREIN
DOES BROTHERHOOD LIE?

474
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:20,319
Master Kan: YOUR QUESTION
IS MOST WORTH ASKING,

475
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:22,654
MOST WORTH CONSIDERING.

476
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,584
WE MUST GO THROUGH
THE PATH.

477
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,689
WE WILL WAIT UNTIL DARK.

478
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,503
I DIDN'T HEAR NOTHIN'.

479
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:25,777
Jess: NOW, GET
THAT CHINEY.

480
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:31,817
STRAW.

481
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,084
THEY'RE GONE.

482
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:36,355
WE AIN'T NEVER GONNA PICK UP
THEIR TRAIL BEFORE DAYLIGHT.

483
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,557
YEAH. BUT THEY'RE
ON FOOT NOW.

484
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,959
AND WE STILL GOT
A SHOT AT THEM.

485
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:42,694
WELL, LET'S GO!

486
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:13,492
OH.

487
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,693
YOU ARE NOT KEEPING PACE.

488
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,028
I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.

489
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,064
I DO NOT THINK SO.

490
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:23,869
THERE IS HOSKAY.

491
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,371
HE DOES NOT LAG BEHIND.

492
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:26,972
HE IS SUFFERING
FROM A WOUND.

493
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:30,742
LISTEN, WHY DON'T,
UH, YOU AND HIM
GO ON WITHOUT ME?

494
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,878
I WOULDN'T WANNA
HOLD YOU UP.

495
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,319
HOW FAR IS YOUR VILLAGE
FROM HERE?

496
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:46,425
THERE'S A MOUNTAIN...

497
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,259
BEYOND THE ONE
THAT YOU SEE.

498
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,763
MY PEOPLE LIVE
ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN.

499
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,634
OH, THAT'S A LONG
STRETCH OF DAYLIGHT.

500
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,335
BETTER LOOK FORWARD
TO MEETIN' MY BOYS

501
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:58,870
SOMEWHERE ALONG
THE WAY.

502
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:03,174
YOU WISH TO REST?

503
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:04,910
NO.

504
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:07,913
COME.

505
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,384
HUMPH.

506
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:20,058
CAN YOU REACH YOUR
PEOPLE WITHOUT HELP?

507
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,767
YES.

508
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:31,770
WILL YOU STAND?

509
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:33,572
UH-UH.

510
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,412
THEN...

511
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,347
GOOD-BYE...

512
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,483
MY BROTHER.

513
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:56,795
YOU RELEASE ME
FROM THE PROMISE I GAVE YOU?

514
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:58,764
NO.

515
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,671
HEY, CHINAMAN.

516
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,673
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
JUST LEAVE ME
HERE, ARE YOU?

517
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,542
IT DOES NOT PROFIT
ME TO STAY.

518
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,343
THEN COME CUT
ME LOOSE.

519
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,012
WHY?

520
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,847
HE HAS GIVEN HIS WORD.

521
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,249
I'M DEAD THE
MINUTE YOU GO
OVER THAT RISE.

522
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,652
YOU DO NOT LIKE
THE IDEA OF DYING?

523
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,188
I DON'T LIKE
THE IDEA OF
BEING HELPLESS.

524
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:55,587
IS THAT YOU, TEH-SOONG?

525
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,490
IT IS I, MASTER.

526
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:02,961
YOU RETURN
ONCE MORE TO US...

527
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:07,899
ALIVE, UNHARMED.

528
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,139
YOU WEAR THE RAGS
OF A BEGGAR?

529
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:18,544
A LOWLIER GARMENT
I COULD NOT FIND.

530
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,247
YOU RETURN FROM YOUR CAUSE?

531
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,617
IT WAS FALSE.

532
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:29,721
YOU SOUGHT TO RELIEVE
THE BURDENS OF THE PEOPLE.

533
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:36,562
MY CONCERN ONLY
VISITED GREATER
SUFFERING UPON THEM.

534
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:44,235
I FAILED.

535
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,805
FOR IN THEIR NAME
THOU LEAD,

536
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:51,810
PROCLAIMING I SOUGHT
MY OWN GLORY.

537
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,881
IT HAS BEEN SAID,

538
00:41:55,947 --> 00:42:02,053
"BE UTTERLY HUMBLE
AND YOU SHALL HOLD
TO THE FOUNDATION OF PEACE.

539
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:07,693
"BE AT ONE WITH ALL
THESE LIVING THINGS

540
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10,528
"WHICH HAVING ARISEN
AND FLOURISHED,

541
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:15,266
RETURN TO THE QUIET
WHENCE THEY CAME."

542
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,470
WILL YOU...

543
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,106
ABIDE WITH US?

544
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,078
YOU WILL ALLOW ME?

545
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:30,148
OUR HEARTS ARE OPEN.

546
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,285
I BEG YOUR
FORGIVENESS, MASTER.

547
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,823
YOU HAVE MY LOVE.

548
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,391
FORGIVENESS?

549
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:44,195
IF YOU WILL FIND THAT,

550
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:48,834
IT MUST COME
FROM THE ONE WHO HAS
CONDEMNED YOU, TEH-SOONG.

551
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:55,073
I WOULD HOPE HE WOULD
BE GENEROUS.

552
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,008
SURELY.

553
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,945
THERE HAS BEEN
ENOUGH DESTRUCTION.

554
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:15,160
WHAT YOU DO NOT LIKE IS
THAT YOUR LIFE DEPENDS

555
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,995
ON THE PROMISE
OF AN APACHE,

556
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:19,931
THE SCRUPLES
OF A CHINAMAN

557
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:22,533
WHICH YOU DO NOT
UNDERSTAND.

558
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,237
IT IS NOT HARD
TO UNDERSTAND.

559
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,242
THIS IS NOT AN INDIAN,
NOT AN APACHE,

560
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,244
BUT A MAN

561
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:34,913
WHOSE NAME IS HOSKAY.

562
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:42,320
I AM NOT A CHINAMAN...
OR A BREED.

563
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:43,922
I AM A MAN.

564
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,758
MY NAME IS
KWAI CHANG CAINE.

565
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,878
COME ON! LET'S GO!

566
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,155
COME ON, GUYS!

567
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:30,936
GOOD LUCK, RAFE.

568
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,103
COME ON.

569
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,227
MY VISION WAS TRUE.

570
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:58,263
I SAT ON A GRAY HORSE.

571
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,799
MY BROTHER RODE BEHIND ME.

572
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:06,738
AND NOW, WHITE MAN
WILL FALL INTO DARKNESS.

573
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:21,286
EVEN NOW, YOU HOLD ME
TO MY PROMISE?

574
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,490
THIS MAN IS A BUTCHER
TO ALL MY PEOPLE.

575
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:32,263
YOUR VISION
OF VENGEANCE
WILL DESTROY YOU...

576
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,498
AND ALL YOUR PEOPLE.

577
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,304
AAH!

578
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,091
UHH.

579
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,052
HE TRIED TO KILL YOU.

580
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,354
HOW COME YOU BOTHER
WITH HIM?

581
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:40,431
HEY, TELL ME SOMETHING,
CHINAMAN.

582
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:42,400
WHY'D YOU STOP HOSKAY?

583
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,078
WORD OF AN APACHE
AND SCRUPLES
OF A CHINAMAN, HUH?

584
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:57,382
WELL, HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO HOLD ON TO THAT?

585
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:05,390
HEY, CHINAMAN,
WAIT A MINUTE.

586
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:07,225
NOW, WHERE YOU GOING?

587
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:10,695
TEMESCAL.

588
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,397
TEMESCAL?!

589
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:17,268
UM.

590
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:21,539
WELL...

591
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:23,841
MAYBE I'LL COME
WITH YOU.

592
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:26,144
HEY!

593
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:27,278
HEY!

594
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,914
KWAI CHANG CAINE.

595
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,416
WILL YOU WAIT A MINUTE?

596
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:08,319
LET US RENEW THE
WORDS OF THE SAGE.

597
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,887
MAN AT HIS BEST...

598
00:48:09,955 --> 00:48:11,022
LIKE WATER...

599
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:13,491
SERVES
AS HE GOES ALONG...

600
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:14,559
LIKE WATER.

601
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,694
HE SEEKS
HIS OWN LEVEL...

602
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:19,264
THE COMMON LEVEL OF LIFE.

603
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,034
WHAT HE MUST DO,
HE DOES...

604
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,702
BUT NOT FOR GLORY.

605
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,938
WHAT HE MUST DO,
HE DOES...

606
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:28,739
BUT NOT FOR SHOW.

607
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:31,409
WHAT HE MUST DO,
HE DOES...

608
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:33,411
BUT NOT FOR SELF.

609
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:49,961
A SOUND MAN NOT
ADVANCING HIMSELF...

610
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:53,664
HE ENDLESSLY
BECOMES HIMSELF.

611
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,503
YES.

612
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:33,438
HE IS ONE
WITH US AGAIN.

613
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:37,108
AND WITH HIMSELF.

614
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:42,613
EVERY MAN HAS HIS
YES AND HIS NO.

615
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:49,754
FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT,
ALWAYS HIS YES AND HIS NO.
