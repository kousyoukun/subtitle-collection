1
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,752
Your tread must be
light and sure...

2
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:55,089
...as though your path
were upon rice paper.

3
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:01,262
It is said a Shaolin priest
can walk through walls.

4
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,332
Looked for, he cannot be seen.

5
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,335
Listened for,
he cannot be heard.

6
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,071
Touched, he cannot be felt.

7
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:13,574
This rice paper is the test.

8
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:17,077
Fragile as the wings
of the dragonfly

9
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:20,714
clinging as the cocoon
of the silkworm.

10
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:25,119
When you can walk its length
and leave no trace...

11
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:27,621
...you will have learned.

12
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:37,331
And what brings you to the road
leading to the Temple of Heaven?

13
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:41,835
I come to celebrate
your life ambition.

14
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,807
The full moon of May.

15
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:51,145
-Thirteenth day...
-Fall back.

16
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:53,914
-...of the fifth month...
-Move.

17
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,416
...of the Year of the Dog.

18
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,385
Make way for the royal nephew.

19
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,388
Out of the way.
Get out of the way.

20
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,615
He's just killed the royal
nephew. Get the guard!

21
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,619
Did you...? Did you kill him?

22
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,356
Yes, my master.

23
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:38,091
After all your teaching,
I have disgraced myself.

24
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:43,997
No. Sometimes one must cut off
a finger to save a hand.

25
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:48,402
There will be a price on your
head, no place to hide.

26
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:51,305
You must leave the country.

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,476
If I had a son...

28
00:02:55,543 --> 00:03:00,914
...all I could offer him
is contained in this pouch.

29
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,885
Please, take it.

30
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,740
What of the dishonor

31
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,877
taking part in the murder
of an old priest?

32
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,712
It was our duty.

33
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,916
Your skills will not prevail,
Shaolin.

34
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:39,052
Each of us, in his own way,
has studied for long years...

35
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,922
...to master the disciplines
of destruction.

36
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,793
Sun Lo.

37
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,665
Sun Lo has studied
with the ninja.

38
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,935
He is supreme in the science
of shuriken.

39
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,453
Wong Ti.

40
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,560
Wong Ti is an expert
in the ways of the Bushido...

41
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:22,596
...and the weapons
of the samurai.

42
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,276
And you?

43
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:37,945
In Tibet, I studied with a lama

44
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,948
who was master
of the mystic arts.

45
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:45,018
Which it will soon be my
privilege to demonstrate to you.

46
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,482
Master, can these things
be real?

47
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:52,553
Did you not see them
with your own eyes?

48
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,557
Is it not possible that the lama
put them into our minds...

49
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,626
...to make us believe
they were there?

50
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,430
We are taught that
all things are possible.

51
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:26,119
Grasshopper, would you please
gather some of the fruit?

52
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,890
They promise to be most
succulent and nourishing.

53
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:55,449
I have known of such things.

54
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,885
Never as you will
soon know them.

55
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:02,089
When next you come this way,
we will engage.

56
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,893
It shall be.

57
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:57,410
It is often said that
to be effective...

58
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,048
...one must act with
forthrightness and great force.

59
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:04,417
But what is to be gained
from such a course...

60
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:09,890
...if the end one is embarked
upon is a righteous action?

61
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,292
It flows the way of the Tao.

62
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,563
Forces are in motion
to which we cannot add...

63
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,698
...from which
we cannot subtract.

64
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:22,469
If our path is right, there
is only one course to follow.

65
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:27,741
The correct action is to do
nothing and all will be done.

66
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,055
Do I know you?

67
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,193
I am Kwai Chang Caine.

68
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,605
Yes.

69
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,207
You knew I would come?

70
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,944
What is it you wish?

71
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:09,016
For a dead man to find rest.

72
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,623
Did you ever know your
grandfather, Mr. Caine?

73
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,859
I met him only once.

74
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:24,564
Do you know what he was to me?

75
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,968
Yes.

76
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,738
Oh, no, I don't think so.

77
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:36,243
He was a laborer. A stonemason.

78
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,881
Hammer and chisel and stone.

79
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:46,787
His eyes were bloodshot
from stone chips.

80
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:53,226
His hands were calloused, dirty.

81
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:00,600
I offered him myself.

82
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,174
You offered him a great deal.

83
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:15,215
Mr. Caine,
you are an abomination.

84
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:21,755
Do you think I want your
understanding? Your compassion?

85
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,624
It is not why I came.

86
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:28,328
Why did you come?

87
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:34,935
In China, it is said:

88
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:38,338
"A son may not live
under the same sky

89
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:42,042
as the murderer of his father."

90
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,013
Then die.

91
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,817
No.

92
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:54,121
Are you going to kill me?

93
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,858
No.

94
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,562
Johnny?

95
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:06,867
I do not hold Johnny responsible
for my grandfather's death...

96
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:10,403
...though I believe he pulled
the trigger.

97
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,640
Whom do you hold responsible?

98
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,743
You.

99
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,113
And what will you do about it?

100
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,917
Nothing.

101
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,755
It is you who will act.

102
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,223
And what will I do?

103
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,161
I do not know.

104
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:40,200
You know why I hate
the sight of you, Mr. Caine?

105
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,369
No.

106
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,439
You might have been my grandson.

107
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,444
Mr. Caine

108
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:57,450
if you do not take that look
of pity from your eyes...

109
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,220
...I will shoot you myself.

110
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,462
Sara?

111
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,165
He was here.

112
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,035
-I know, I just saw him leaving.
-Can you imagine?

113
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,703
Here, in this house.

114
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,844
His clothes were no better
than rags. And his feet bare.

115
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,981
-Absolutely bare.
-Why didn't you call me?

116
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:06,319
I almost did, but I didn't
want anything to happen...

117
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,857
...here.

118
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,896
Well, how much does he know?

119
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,865
He knows.

120
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:21,068
What does he plan to do?
Did he say?

121
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:26,406
His kind never does, Johnny.
They just act.

122
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:34,314
He's got a plan. I know it.

123
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,020
Sara, I don't wanna do anything
that I'm--

124
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,789
I don't wanna do anything
unnecessary, that's all.

125
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:46,126
Oh, I wouldn't want you to.

126
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:52,933
I turned around and he was gone.
Like that.

127
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,738
Maybe he'll just leave.

128
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:02,042
I mean, if he was here
and he didn't do anything...

129
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:06,146
...maybe he doesn't have a plan.

130
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,449
He said something about
not being able to live...

131
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:14,054
...under the same sky
as his grandfather's murderer.

132
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,992
What does that suggest?

133
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,133
You didn't tell me that, Sara.

134
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:33,540
You chided me for pushing you,
remember?

135
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,844
I'm trying not to do that.

136
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,180
I won't do it.

137
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,285
You'll do what's right, Johnny.

138
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,991
I trust your judgment...

139
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,427
...completely.

140
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,567
I'll be here...

141
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,237
...waiting.

142
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:55,055
I've gotta kill you, Caine.

143
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,925
Question of honor.

144
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,394
Where does honor lie?

145
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,632
I don't have the answer.

146
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,501
But I've got the solution.

147
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:22,882
You killed an old man.
Was that a solution?

148
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,451
Yup.

149
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,155
And long overdue.

150
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,757
What was solved?

151
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,461
Pain, hurt, dishonor.

152
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:38,365
-Yours?
-No, my grandmother's.

153
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,168
It became my duty
to avenge that dishonor.

154
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,670
-Why?
-Because we're a family.

155
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,039
What affects one affects us all.

156
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,709
Now...

157
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,011
...there is only greater pain.

158
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,347
Yours.

159
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,819
Henry Raphael Caine...

160
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,655
...was part of two families...

161
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:06,193
...mine and yours.

162
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,662
-Never.
-Yes, it is true.

163
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:15,368
He is grandfather to both of us.

164
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,539
You're lying.

165
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:24,444
Henry Raphael Caine,
Sara Kingsley...

166
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:29,482
...a young man
and a young woman, met.

167
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,051
She bore him a child
out of wedlock.

168
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,054
That child was your mother.

169
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,261
My grandfather?

170
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,111
Kwai Chang Caine?

171
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,849
I'm waiting.

172
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,433
We will bury our dead first.

173
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,895
Johnny.

174
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,834
I'm going numb.

175
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,979
The darts are poisoned.

176
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:34,353
My grandfather....

177
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:44,030
I killed my grandfather.

178
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,132
You did not know.

179
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,035
He was my blood.

180
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,941
Like you.

181
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:09,789
I'm so sorry.

182
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,148
I saw him into this world.

183
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:12,552
I never thought I'd see him out.

184
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:17,423
I did what you asked.

185
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,026
I listed the death
as a natural cause.

186
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,763
I'm not sure it was
the right thing to do.

187
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:30,837
Sara, I know you said no
services, but I'd be willing--

188
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,005
Cover it.

189
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,575
We have offered our lives.

190
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,044
Our brother has given his.

191
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,815
The priest must die.

192
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:18,050
Our brother's spirit
wanders unfulfilled

193
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:22,221
in the land of the dead
and cries for vengeance.

194
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:27,026
Over his earthly remains,
we here renew our blood oath.

195
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:31,063
Into the gap created by his
death, we thrust ourselves.

196
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,834
May our lives be snuffed out
if we betray this oath.

197
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:38,571
We swear the death
of Kwai Chang Caine.

198
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:03,362
If there's anything I can do--

199
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,197
If you were a man...

200
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,668
...you'd know what
remains to be done.

201
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,356
Your mother and father?

202
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,096
How did they die?

203
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,401
They drowned.

204
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,938
Bridge washout. Flash flood.

205
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,110
Caine, look around you.

206
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:29,682
My mother and my father,
my grandfather.

207
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:33,185
And now Johnny.

208
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:39,358
He gave his life for me.

209
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:43,295
And I sent for the men
who killed him.

210
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:51,938
You are not to blame.

211
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:57,276
All I know is I've lost him.

212
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,813
She took him.

213
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:04,450
At the last...

214
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,287
...he was yours, not hers.

215
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,160
Where shall I go now?

216
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,297
I can't go back to her.

217
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,502
Leave.

218
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,105
But where shall I go?

219
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:31,177
Wherever you wish.

220
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:39,986
You and I, we have the same
blood in our veins.

221
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,396
Yes.

222
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,765
Caine.

223
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,286
Please get up.

224
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:18,057
Why have you come?

225
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:24,696
To confess my unworthiness,
honorable sir.

226
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:30,336
I have disgraced my teachers
and shamed this holy place.

227
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,204
Tell me how.

228
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,707
I have senselessly taken a life.

229
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,145
You speak of the nephew
of the emperor.

230
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:43,349
It was he, was it not,
who killed our Master Po?

231
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:47,453
I have shamed my master's
memory.

232
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,022
Did you not think to run?

233
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:54,460
I thought to run, but I could
not find it within me...

234
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,396
...to leave Master Po dying.

235
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,935
The guilt is not yours.

236
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,547
This is the grave of Master Po.

237
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,317
This earth is honored
to receive him.

238
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:21,988
May his bones find rest
in this place...

239
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,924
...and may his passing,
in its violence

240
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,659
not wake the tigers
of outrage...

241
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:30,196
...the dragons of vengeance.

242
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,766
The pursuit by
the Imperial Police

243
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,104
will be relentless, unending.

244
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,874
I understand, master.

245
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:45,277
You remain a Shaolin priest.

246
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,281
Nothing is diminished,
nothing undone.

247
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:52,284
Thank you, master.

248
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,922
You have visited the grave
of Master Po.

249
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:59,225
Now you must leave us forever.

250
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:06,165
And I cannot say which is
the greater grief to my heart.

251
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,600
Go.

252
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,863
Margie.

253
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,266
Margit!

254
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,936
Where are you going?

255
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,273
Away from here.

256
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:32,010
You're giving up
the Kingsley ranch?

257
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:37,716
Remember, Sara,
I'm not a Kingsley.

258
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:42,020
No, you're not.

259
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:44,656
You're a Caine.

260
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:49,461
Go to your own kind.

261
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:54,166
Goodbye, Sara.

262
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:16,114
You fight well, priest.

263
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:21,453
I did not wish to fight at all.

264
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,258
You must. You must now face me.

265
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:29,461
I have sworn an oath.

266
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,335
Not here.

267
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:41,740
There.

268
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,414
No.

269
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,082
That is where your power
is greatest.

270
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,784
You must.

271
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:57,656
You must now fight me.

272
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,810
Do such things exist?

273
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:29,515
Do wars, famine,
disease and death exist?

274
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:33,018
Do lust, greed and hate exist?

275
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,753
They do.

276
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,189
But how?
Where do they come from?

277
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,892
They are man's creations...

278
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:45,230
...brought to being by the dark
side of their nature.

279
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:47,999
I come for Margit McLean.

280
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,201
To free the girl...

281
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:55,206
...you must enter the kyilkhor.

282
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,310
And to enter the kyilkhor...

283
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:01,279
...is to die.

284
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:06,318
-And if I live?
-You will not.

285
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:12,290
If you live...

286
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:14,125
...the girl will live.

287
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:17,596
But it will not end for you.

288
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:21,066
The members of our society
are many.

289
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,068
Each is prepared to die...

290
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:28,607
...until your death avenges the
dishonor you have brought on us.

291
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,812
There is no escape.

292
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,517
I do not seek to escape.

293
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:23,622
Sara...

294
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,827
...I forgive you.

295
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,164
I love you.

296
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,522
Sara! Sara!

297
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:30,976
How can man rid himself
of such terrible things?

298
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:36,547
Each man must start with
himself, within himself...

299
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,084
...by slowly forging his chi...

300
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,421
...the bond between the finite
and the infinite.

301
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:45,991
The inner essence of his spirit

302
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:49,795
and the limitless power
of the universe.

303
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:54,866
Only thus can you conquer
the power...

304
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:58,003
...and the presence of evil.

305
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:26,597
What have you won, priest?

306
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,467
Respite? Time?

307
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:35,573
For surely you know the heart
of the beast still lives...

308
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,910
...grows, reaches out.

309
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:41,913
Where will you go
to escape it...

310
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,683
...except to the heart
of the heart...

311
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:51,022
...where you and I must meet?

312
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:36,301
-Is he at rest?
-I believe so.

313
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:40,138
And for her?

314
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:45,710
She would not accept
my compassion...

315
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:49,514
...or my pity while she lived.

316
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:53,318
And she was right.

317
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:59,257
For what is my compassion,
my pity, to her?

318
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:01,927
Caine?

319
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:04,830
Will we ever see them again?

320
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:08,566
No one may know.

321
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:11,136
But you were a priest.

322
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:15,306
-Yes.
-And do you believe?

323
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,108
Yes.
