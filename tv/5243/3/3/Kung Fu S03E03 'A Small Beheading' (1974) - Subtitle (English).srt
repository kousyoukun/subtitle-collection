1
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,648
WE HAVE BUSINESS,
YOU AND I, HMM?

2
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:51,919
WE HAVE BUSINESS?

3
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:55,256
THERE IS NO NEED
TO SHOUT BETWEEN US.

4
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:57,458
WE'LL CONDUCT
OUR BUSINESS
LIKE GENTLEMEN.

5
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,060
NOW TELL ME.

6
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,932
TELL ME.

7
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,889
HERE.

8
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,925
THIS, I THINK,
MUST BE THE PLACE.

9
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,827
GOOD DAY
TO YOU, LAD.

10
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,062
MAY WE HAVE
SOME WATER?

11
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,897
WATER IS FREE.

12
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,567
FREE. FREE, YOU SAY.

13
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,901
AH!

14
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,703
NOT SO. NOT ALWAYS.

15
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,739
EVEN THIS YOU'RE
BUILDING A FENCE AROUND.

16
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,742
YOU CAN HELP ME, SIR.

17
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,180
I'M LOOKING FOR
AN ORIENTAL GENTLEMAN

18
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,582
VERY CLOSE
TO YOUR AGE...

19
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,718
A MAN ABOUT YOUR HEIGHT,
NOT TOO FAR FROM YOUR WIDTH.

20
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:04,525
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT
WITH SUCH A MAN?

21
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:05,359
WELL...

22
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,695
WHEN I FIND HIM...

23
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,263
I'LL TELL HIM!

24
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:05,253
Master Kan: YOUR TREAD
MUST BE LIGHT AND SURE,

25
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,721
AS THOUGH YOUR PATH
WERE UPON RICE PAPER.

26
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,462
IT IS SAID A SHAOLIN PRIEST
CAN WALK THROUGH WALLS.

27
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,465
LOOKED FOR,
HE CANNOT BE SEEN.

28
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,634
LISTENED FOR,
HE CANNOT BE HEARD.

29
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,238
TOUCHED,
HE CANNOT BE FELT.

30
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,807
THIS RICE PAPER
IS THE TEST--

31
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,244
FRAGILE AS THE WINGS
OF THE DRAGONFLY,

32
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,646
CLINGING AS THE COCOON
OF THE SILKWORM.

33
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,216
WHEN YOU CAN
WALK ITS LENGTH

34
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,386
AND LEAVE NO TRACE,

35
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,254
YOU WILL HAVE LEARNED.

36
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,994
UNH!

37
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,399
HA HA HA!
BRAVO, CLARENCE!

38
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,606
AAH!

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,643
OOH!

40
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,225
DROP IT. DROP IT.

41
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,660
DROP IT, I SAID!

42
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,231
BLOOD HAS NO PART
IN THIS.

43
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,633
MAGNIFICENT.

44
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,001
MAKING FOOLS
OUT OF MY FOOLS.

45
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,370
IF THE FIGHTING'S
DIRTY,

46
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,772
THESE TWO ARE
WORTH A PLATOON
OF MERCENARIES.

47
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,007
THEY'VE DEFENDED
THEIR DISHONOR
IN SALOONS

48
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,844
FROM SAN FRANCISCO
TO MADAGASCAR,

49
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,412
AND NOBODY EVER DID

50
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,481
WHAT YOU DID
TO THEM BEFORE.

51
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:43,083
I'LL STAKE
MY LIFE ON IT.

52
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,518
YOU'VE THE BRAND
OF THE TIGER

53
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,487
AND THE DRAGON
ON YOUR ARMS, EH?

54
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,189
YOU ARE
KWAI CHANG CAINE.

55
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,458
AND IF I AM?

56
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,927
I AM BRANDYWINE GAGE,
CAPTAIN GAGE,

57
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,697
ASHORE FROM THE SHIP
PEKING LADY.

58
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,099
RUMP-SPRUNG
AND CALLOUSED

59
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,702
WHERE NO MAN OUGHT
TO BE CALLOUSED.

60
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,037
THIS BRACE
OF SURLY DOGS--

61
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,006
MY FIRST MATE
CLARENCE MURPHY...

62
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,579
AND TRAN CHOU.

63
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,848
HE COULD PEEL A POTATO
AT 20 YARDS

64
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,150
JUST BY HATING IT.

65
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,752
YOU'RE ANGRY, LAD.

66
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,456
THIS SHOULD
MAKE AMENDS.

67
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,500
WHAT IS IT?

68
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,102
MORE THAN YOU EVER
DREAMED ABOUT, LAD.

69
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,938
AH!

70
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,841
KWAI CHANG CAINE,
I'VE A RING FOR YOU,

71
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,044
AND A NAME.

72
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,047
YWANG KYU.

73
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,783
MEAN ANYTHING, EH?

74
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,258
MASTER KYU?

75
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,793
YES?

76
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,029
THERE IS
AN INJURED MAN
AT THE GATES.

77
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,419
ARE YOU THE OLD MAN
WHO HEALS?

78
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,254
I AM HE.

79
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,289
IT IS GONE.

80
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,260
COME.
LET ME SEE IT.

81
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,596
YOU DESERVE IT,
DRUNKEN FOOL.

82
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,602
NO ONE DESERVES PAIN.

83
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,739
AAH! UNH.

84
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,311
ALL WILL BE CARED FOR,

85
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,847
BUT YOU MUST DO
JUST WHAT I TELL YOU.

86
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,185
YOU MAY SEE HIM
TOMORROW.

87
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,854
I HAVE WORK TO DO,
AND SO HAS HE.

88
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,991
WE SHALL DO
WHAT WE CAN.

89
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,292
COME.

90
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,904
YES...I KNOW HIM.

91
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,908
OLD TEACHER
OF YOURS, EH?

92
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,778
YOU HAVE NEWS OF HIM.

93
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,547
HE IS WELL?

94
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,217
HE'S DEAD, LAD.

95
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,825
THE YELLOW HOUSE
IN TOWN, CAINE.

96
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,528
AFTER YOU'VE
READ YOUR LETTER,

97
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,462
COME SEE ME.

98
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,180
"WE, BY THE GRACE
OF HEAVEN, EMPEROR...

99
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,784
"INSTRUCT ALL MEN

100

FOR CRIMES AGAINST OUR
IMPERIAL THRONE, HAS--"

103
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,295
YES?

104
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,930
IT'S ME--ELLIE.

105
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,700
YOU DIDN'T COME
TO SUPPER.

106
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,003
YOU ARE VERY KIND.

107
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,213
YOU'VE CHANGED THINGS
AROUND HERE, CAINE.

108
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,050
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE
WHAT THINGS LOOKED LIKE
AFTER FATHER DIED.

109
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:14,254
THINGS SEEMED
SO HARD TO GET DONE,
LIKE THAT FENCE.

110
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:18,525
YOU MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
A WHOLE RANGE CREW'S
BEEN WORKING ON IT.

111
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:19,927
IT WILL SERVE.

112
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,195
IT'S THE BEST FENCE
IN THE COUNTY.

113
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,604
WHAT DID THOSE FELLOWS
WANT THIS MORNING?

114
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,640
THEY BROUGHT ME THIS.

115
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,476
WHAT IS THAT?

116
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,978
A PARDON...

117
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,947
FROM THE EMPEROR
OF CHINA.

118
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,369
YOUR MEN ARE
SHOOTING AT ME.

119
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,172
BELAY THAT!

120
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,808
THIS IS NONE OF MINE.

121
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,410
STAY DOWN.

122
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,524
CHING, YOU'RE
A BLOODY, BLOODY FOOL!

123
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,093
YOU ALMOST
RUINED EVERYTHING!
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

124
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,063
I OUGHT TO HAVE YOU
FLOGGED TILL THE WHIP
CRIES "MERCY."

125
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,133
YOU ARE MY HUSBAND,
AND I BELONG TO YOU,

126
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,668
AND YOU MAY WHIP ME
IF IT PLEASES YOU,

127
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:11,304
BUT I'LL SHOOT HIM AGAIN
IF I GET A CHANCE.

128
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,073
CHING, YOU...

129
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,777
AH.

130
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,246
KWAI CHANG CAINE?

131
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,680
I AM HERE.

132
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,716
CATCH.
HA HA HA!

133
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,885
THERE WILL BE
NO MORE SHOOTING.

134
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,922
COME IN.

135
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,431
AH, MR. CAINE.

136
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,499
UH.

137
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,569
COME ALONG, THEN.
COME ALONG.

138
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,371
HA HA HA!

139
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,906
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET

140
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,842
MY MISCHIEVOUS,
MOST DEAR WIFE,

141
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,878
THE LADY CHI CHING.

142
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,712
SHE IS OF THE ROYAL COURT

143
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,581
AND NIECE
TO THE EMPEROR HIMSELF.

144
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,483
CHING, BE A LOVELY GIRL,
WILL YOU,

145
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,151
AND APOLOGIZE
TO MR. CAINE

146
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,187
AS YOU MEET HIM,
EH, MY SWEET?

147
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,790
I WISH TO PLEASE
YOU, MY HUSBAND,

148
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:06,226
BUT DO NOT ASK ME
TO APOLOGIZE
TO THAT MURDERER.

149
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,862
Man: HE'S JUST KILLED
THE ROYAL NEPHEW!
GET THE GUARD!

150
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,430
Master:
DID YOU KILL HIM?

151
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,464
YES, MY MASTER.

152
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,400
YOU MUST LEAVE
THE COUNTRY.

153
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,902
Gage: THE BOY
YOU KILLED,

154
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,238
THE NEPHEW TO THE EMPEROR--
HE WAS HER BROTHER.

155
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,108
THEY WERE VERY CLOSE.

156
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,610
I...AM SORRY.

157
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,245
THERE, YOU SEE?
HE'S A PROPER GENTLEMAN,

158
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,981
SO I MUST INSIST,
DEAR WIFE, APOLOGIZE.

159
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,152
WE MAY BE BARBARIANS
IN AMERICA,

160
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,455
BUT WE DON'T
GO AROUND SHOOTING
ONE ANOTHER...OFTEN.

161
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,528
I AM SORRY,
KWAI CHANG...

162
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,932
THAT I TRIED
TO SHOOT YOU...

163
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,499
AND MISSED.

164
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,372
I'M AFRAID THAT
WILL HAVE TO DO,
EH, OLD FELLOW?

165
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,907
IT WILL DO.

166
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,076
NOW TO BUSINESS.

167
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,478
CAN I HAVE
MY PISTOL BACK,
PLEASE?

168
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,150
AH, AH, AH, AH.
NO MORE OF THAT.

169
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,717
GIVE IT HERE.

170
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,353
NOW YOU GO THERE
AND SIT DOWN

171
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,788
LIKE A GOOD LITTLE PRINCESS
AND BEHAVE YOURSELF.

172
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,862
SO, KWAI CHANG,

173
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:17,797
YOU READ
THE EMPEROR'S DECREE.

174
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,667
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

175
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,236
HE HAS SWORN
TO SEE ME DIE.

176
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,704
AYE...

177
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,806
AND NOTHING WOULD
PLEASE HIM MORE,

178
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,909
BUT LIKE ALL MEN
GREAT AND SMALL,

179
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,410
TROUBLE CAME TO HIM.

180
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,746
HIS NEWEST BRIDE--
PRETTY LITTLE GIRL--

181
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,248
MU LING,
CAME DOWN WITH

182
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,017
THE BRAIN FEVER,
DON'T YOU SEE?

183
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,486
WELL, HIS MAJESTY
ANNOUNCED

184
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,621
WHOEVER COULD CURE
MU LING

185
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,323
SHOULD HAVE
WHATEVER HE DESIRED.

186
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,726
YOUR OLD SHAMAN
YWANG KYU CAME ALONG

187
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,228
AND CURED HER
RIGHT UP,

188
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,264
AND WHAT HE DESIRED
WAS FORGIVENESS FOR YOU.

189
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,102
THIS IS TRUE?

190
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,704
AS TRUE AS I'M
STANDING HERE.

191
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,474
WELL, THE EMPEROR
WAS OUTRAGED AT FIRST

192
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,312
HAD YWANG KYU
THROWN OUT OF THE PALACE,

193
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,947
BUT THEN...

194
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,116
THEN?

195
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,218
THEN...

196
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,054
THEY STRUCK A BARGAIN.

197
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,092
Gage: AH!

198
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,261
THE EMPEROR INSISTED

199
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,463
THAT ROYAL HONOR
DEMANDED A BEHEADING,

200
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,265
AND THEY SO AGREED.

201
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,935
OF WHAT USE
IS SUCH A PARDON?

202
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,303
WHAT IS PARDONED,
MY HEADLESS BODY?

203
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,506
PLEASE, LISTEN TO ME.
NOT YOUR HEAD, LAD.

204
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,842
A TOKEN,
A SMALL BEHEADING.

205
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,111
THE SMALL FINGER
OF YOUR RIGHT HAND.

206
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,313
THEY AGREED.
THAT'S ALL.

207
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,416
WHY THAT?

208
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,786
OH, WELL, THE EMPEROR
WANTED MORE, BELIEVE ME.

209
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,788
HE'S NOT
A CHARITABLE MAN.

210
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,958
NO, THIS WAS
YWANG KYU'S IDEA.

211
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,826
HE SAID...

212
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,028
THAT YOU
WOULD UNDERSTAND.

213
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,767
Injured man: BECAUSE
I WAS A RASCAL AND A FOOL,

214
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,904
I GAMBLED AWAY
ALL THE MONTH'S RENT
FROM MY TENANTS,

215
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,274
BOUGHT...

216
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,343
WINE FOR EVERYONE,

217
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,480
PAID THE FLOWER GIRLS
FOR THEIR SONG.

218
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,848
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT.

219
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,519
AT LAST...
THEY GOADED ME INTO IT!

220
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,123
I BET MY FINGER.

221
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,159
MAU THREW THE DICE...

222
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,796
AND I LOST!

223
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,366
IT HURTS, MASTER KYU!
IT HURTS!

224
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,935
AND WHAT
WOULD YOU HAVE WON

225
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,205
IF THE DICE
HAD BEEN OTHERWISE?

226
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,508
4 PIECES OF SILVER.

227
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,680
AS MANY AS I HAVE
FINGERS LEFT!

228
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,451
AND WITH THE 4
PIECES OF SILVER,

229
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:55,488
YOU WOULD HAVE
BOUGHT MORE WINE
AND FLOWER GIRLS,

230
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,090
WOULD YOU NOT?

231
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,328
THEN PERHAPS
WITH THE FINGER,

232
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,331
YOU HAVE BOUGHT
WISDOM,

233
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:07,434
AND THAT WOULD
BE WELL WORTH
THE PRICE.

234
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,539
YOU SAY YWANG KYU
IS DEAD?

235
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,743
YES.

236
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,977
COGNAC?

237
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:21,848
NO. HOW DO YOU
COME BY HIS RING?

238
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,483
GIVEN TO ME
BY THE EMPEROR,

239
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,253
ALONG WITH THE PARCHMENT
I PUT IN YOUR HANDS.

240
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,089
THERE IS SORROW
IN YOU, LAD,

241
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,957
FOR THE DEATH
OF THE OLD MAN,

242
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,093
AND THAT
DOES YOU CREDIT,

243
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,128
BUT YOU AND I
ARE ALIVE,

244
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,231
AND SO I ASK YOU,
ARE YOU READY TO LEAVE?

245
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,300
LEAVE?

246
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,870
AYE, LAD.
LEAVE. GO HOME.

247
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,805
TO CHINA.

248
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,908
MY SHIP LIES
IN THE BAY,

249
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:52,645
LOADED AND PROVISIONED
FOR THE ORIENT,

250
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:56,516
AND I AM LIKE
A BEACHED WHALE
IN THIS BARREN LAND,

251
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,419
DYING FOR A SPLASH
OF WATER AND SALT AIR.

252
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,688
WHAT IS TO HOLD YOU?

253
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,291
WHY, YOU, LAD.

254
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,593
IT'S FREE PASSAGE
I'M OFFERING YOU.

255
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,065
WELL, LAD?

256
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,969
FIRST...I MUST DECIDE

257
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,739
IF I WISH TO PAY THE PRICE.

258
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,841
THE PRICE? HA HA!

259
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,211
MMM, THE WAY
THE WORLD IS,

260
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,446
THIS BIDS FAIR TO BE
A BARGAIN FOR YOU.

261
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,981
EVERYTHING
YOU EVER WANTED--
FRIENDS, HOME, FREEDOM.

262
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,819
YOUR GOOD NAME--
AND ALL IT COSTS--
A LITTLE FINGER.

263
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:38,125
THEN I MUST DECIDE
IF YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH.

264
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,192
Gage: HMM.

265
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,694
NOT TO OFFEND YOU,
CAPTAIN GAGE,

266
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,797
BUT IT WELL MAY BE
YOU MEAN TO BETRAY ME.

267
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,134
WHY SHOULD I DO THAT?

268
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,003
I DO NOT VALUE
MYSELF VERY HIGHLY,

269
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,273
BUT I BELIEVE THE EMPEROR
HAS MUCH TO GIVE

270
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,708
TO A MAN WHO WOULD
BRING ME TO HIM.

271
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,744
OH, LAD,
YOU DON'T KNOW,

272
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,647
AND IT'S NOT
FOR ME TO TRY
AND CONVINCE YOU.

273
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:04,351
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU,
WE LEAVE TOMORROW
AT NOON.

274
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,453
WE SAIL ONE HOUR
AFTER WE'RE ONBOARD,

275
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,722
AND IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME
WHETHER YOU'RE ONBOARD OR NOT.

276
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,492
MAY I SPEAK
TO THE LADY?

277
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:17,897
WHY?

278
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,767
I BELIEVE I MAY
LEARN THE TRUTH.

279
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:28,007
LAD, THE MINUTE SHE
SETS EYES ON YOU,

280
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,742
SHE FIRES A CANNON
IN YOUR DIRECTION,

281
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,978
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THE TRUTH
FROM HER?

282
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,613
YES.

283
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,549
WELL...

284
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,219
GO AHEAD, THEN.

285
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,654
TALK TO HER.

286
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,459
IS THIS TRUTH?

287
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:48,695
AM I PARDONED?

288
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,730
Chi Ching: HOW CAN
YOU BELIEVE ME,

289
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,099
WHATEVER I SAY?

290
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,634
YOU KNOW I HATE YOU.

291
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,937
IF I SAY IT IS TRUE,

292
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,207
THE PARDON MAY BE FALSE.

293
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,542
YOU WILL GO
BACK TO CHINA...

294
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,311
AND DIE.

295
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,279
AND THAT
WOULD PLEASE ME.

296
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,419
AND IF I SAY
IT IS FALSE,

297
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,755
THE PARDON
MAY BE TRUE.

298
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,358
BUT YOU
WILL STAY HERE

299
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:21,561
AND LIVE AMONG
THOSE BARBARIANS,

300
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,331
BARRED FOREVER FROM
YOUR NATIVE LAND.

301
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,835
AND THAT, TOO,
WOULD PLEASE ME.

302
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,403
YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED.

303
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,908
THE LETTER YOU HAVE READ
IS AS IT IS,

304
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,879
AND IT WAS WRITTEN
UNDER MY UNCLE'S ORDER.

305
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,915
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

306
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,254
YES.

307
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,656
WELL, THEN, LAD,
COME ALONG.

308
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,226
I'LL SEE YOU OFF.

309
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,708
YOU WERE MAGNIFICENT.

310
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:13,846
HOW ARTFULLY YOU PICKED
YOUR WAY AROUND THE TRUTH.

311
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,548
I DID NOT LIE.

312
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,216
MY UNCLE IS
INDEED THE AUTHOR

313
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,686
OF THIS TALE
THE FOOL BELIEVES.

314
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:23,923
BRANDY,

315
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,027
WOULD THE AMERICAN
EMPEROR DO
SUCH A THING?

316
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:31,130
LIE? MAKE
A FALSE PROMISE?

317
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,732
MY DEAR CHILD...

318
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,435
GO ASK...

319
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,171
ASK AN INDIAN, EH?

320
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,608
AN EMPEROR...
IS AN EMPEROR,

321
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,443
BY ANY NAME
YOU CALL HIM.

322
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,915
THEN HONOR IS
A CHILDREN'S GAME.

323
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,684
AND WE ARE RICH.

324
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,722
YOU SHOULD HAVE
LET ME SHOOT HIM.

325
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,057
WITH TWICE THE REWARD
OFFERED FOR HIM ALIVE?

326
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,926
IT'S THROWING
MONEY AWAY.

327
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:04,163
YOU TELL ME THAT
NO CHAIN WILL HOLD
THIS SHAOLIN PRIEST,

328
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,399
NO MAN MAY TAKE HIM,

329
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,201
AND YET YOU BAIT
A TRAP WITH WORDS.

330
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,803
IT'S THE ONLY WAY,
MY PET.

331
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,640
HE'LL WALK ONTO MY SHIP
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO,

332
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,075
AND HE'LL STEP UP TO
THE EMPEROR'S CHOPPING BLOCK

333
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,777
BECAUSE HE PROMISED.

334
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,812
AND IF HE DOES NOT?

335
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,581
HEH, IF HE DOES NOT...

336
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,619
IF HE DOES NOT...

337
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:28,888
WELL...

338
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,457
IF HE DOES NOT,

339
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,925
WE'LL SHOOT HIM,
EH, LADS?

340
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:36,523
Injured man: I'VE LOST
TOO MUCH ALREADY! AAH!

341
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,091
THE FIRE HAS
ENTERED THE HAND
THROUGH THE WOUND,

342
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,093
AND THE HAND
IS DEAD ALREADY,

343
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,965
AND IF WE DO NOT
REMOVE THE FIRE,
YOU, TOO, MAY DIE.

344
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,400
DID YOU HEAR ME?

345
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:50,403
LIU, LIU, I'VE DONE
ALL I COULD,

346
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,440
BUT THE SPIRIT OF
THE FINGER IS CALLING
TO THE HAND,

347
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:56,142
IF WE DON'T
GIVE IT, THE SPIRIT
WILL BE ANGERED

348
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,310
AND MAY EVEN
DEMAND MORE!

349
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,246
THE SPIRIT?

350
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,148
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE SPIRIT?

351
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,516
WAS IT HERE?

352
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,985
IT IS HERE,
AT THE WINDOW!

353
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,186
AAH!

354
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,089
AAH! DRIVE IT AWAY!

355
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,492
DRIVE IT AWAY!
AAH! AAH!

356
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,861
NO, YOU CANNOT
HAVE MY HAND!

357
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,963
HOW CAN I WORK?!

358
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,203
YOU LOOKING FOR THIS?

359
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,574
IT HAD A TEAR IN IT.
I PATCHED IT.

360
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:04,143
IT HAD NO TEAR.

361
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,079
YES, IT DID,
ON THE BUTTON.

362
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,051
YOU MUST THINK
I'M AN IDIOT.

363
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,320
NO.

364
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,189
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW
MY APPRECIATION.

365
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,725
FOR WHAT?

366
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,494
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE
DONE AROUND HERE.

367
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,130
YOU FEED ME,

368
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,699
GIVE ME A PLACE
TO SLEEP.

369
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:29,268
IT IS AS IT WAS
AGREED.

370
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,070
BUT IT SEEMS
SO CHEAP.

371
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,606
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
USEFUL FOR YOU.

372
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:36,576
USEFUL?

373
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,178
COOK, CLEAN, SEW--

374
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,614
ALL THE THINGS
A WOMAN CAN DO.

375
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,152
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF?

376
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,087
OF COURSE I DO.

377
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:51,624
THEN WHY DO YOU NEED
TO PERFORM FOR ME?

378
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:59,198
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK THAT I
TAKE YOU FOR GRANTED.

379
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:02,068
YOU KNOW, THAT PAPER
WITH THE PARDON
FROM THE EMPEROR...

380
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,239
IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT
YOU WEREN'T TIED HERE,

381
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:11,210
THAT YOU HAVE YOUR OWN LIFE
AND YOUR OWN INTERESTS,
AND WHATEVER THEY ARE,

382
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:15,081
THEY DON'T CENTER
AROUND THIS RANCH
OR WHAT HAPPENS TO IT.

383
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,652
NOTHING HERE
TO HOLD ME?

384
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:22,655
ONE WORN-DOWN
LITTLE FARMHOUSE

385
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,991
AND A FEW ACRES
OF LAND...

386
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,561
A FEW HEAD
OF STOCK.

387
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,263
I KNOW WHAT I HAVE.

388
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,400
I KNOW WHAT I AM.

389
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:38,537
YOU DO NOT KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE.

390
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:40,006
TELL ME.

391
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,677
YOU ARE...ELLIE.

392
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:47,279
OH, WHAT'S ELLIE?
A NAME.

393
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,749
A WOMAN.

394
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,484
A PERSON.

395
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,555
THERE ARE A LOT
OF WOMEN IN THE WORLD,
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

396
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,963
BUT ONLY ONE ELLIE.

397
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,900
ALONE...
AND FIGHTING.

398
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,671
FIGHTING FOR WHAT?

399
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,773
YOU LOOK
INTO THE MIRROR,

400
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,176
AND YOU SEE
ONLY YOURSELF.

401
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:20,212
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

402
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:25,618
YOU ARE ALONE...
AND SEPARATE,

403
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:30,623
BUT YOU ARE ALSO
PART OF THE LAND...

404
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,960
PART OF
THE PEOPLE...

405
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,630
PART OF THE WHOLE.

406
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:42,301
EVERYTHING IS
WITHIN YOUR REACH.

407
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:46,172
WHERE DO YOU FIT
IN ALL THIS?

408
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:51,143
I ALSO AM...

409
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,682
IN PART
OF THE WHOLE.

410
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,819
WITH ME?

411
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,121
WITH YOU.

412
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,426
YET WE'RE APART.

413
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:10,329
WE ARE JOINED.

414
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,164
ARE WE?

415
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,171
ARE WE?

416
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,951
CAINE?
YES?

417
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,186
I'VE NEVER MET
ANYONE LIKE YOU
BEFORE.

418
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:37,857
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,

419
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:40,492
THE WAY I CAME IN--
YOU MUST THINK
THAT I--

420
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,062
I THINK
YOU ARE...ELLIE.

421
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:47,900
YOU'VE DECIDED TO
GO, HAVEN'T YOU?

422
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:50,770
GO?

423
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,271
BACK TO CHINA.

424
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,108
I DO NOT KNOW.

425
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,245
WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING TO
KEEP YOU HERE.

426
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,915
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL.

427
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,352
THEN WHY GO?

428
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,121
I HAVE
ASKED MYSELF THAT.

429
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,457
THERE IS MUCH HERE
THAT I HAVE LOVED--

430
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:16,028
LAND...AND PEOPLE.

431
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,032
HALF MY LIFE IS HERE,

432
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,969
AND THROUGH MY FATHER,
MY ROOTS.

433
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:28,775
BUT CHINA...IS HOME.

434
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:49,128
WHAT MUST WE SAY
OF THE MIRROR

435
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:52,832
THAT RECEIVES
TRANQUILITY...

436
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,201
YET REFLECTS
TROUBLEMENT?

437
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:01,273
THE MIRROR I SPOKE OF
WAS YOU, STUDENT CAINE.

438
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,710
IT IS NOT FOR MYSELF
I AM TROUBLED, MASTER,

439
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,512
BUT FOR THE
SICK MAN, LIU.

440
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:11,150
IF HE DOES NOT ACCEPT
THE LOSS OF HIS HAND,

441
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,218
HE WILL DIE.

442
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:15,721
DID NOT YWANG KYU
MAKE THIS CLEAR TO HIM?

443
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,689
YES, MASTER, BUT...

444
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,591
YES?

445
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,227
SHALL WE NOT ACT
IN SPITE OF

446
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,595
THE OBSTINACY
OF THE SICK MAN,

447
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,631
WHEN INACTION
MAY DESTROY HIM?

448
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,133
IS IT YOUR FEELING

449
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:30,202
THAT YWANG KYU IS NOT
FORCEFUL ENOUGH?

450
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:34,606
I HAVE ASKED MYSELF
THAT QUESTION.

451
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,443
LOOK TO THE WATER
AT YOUR FEET.

452
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,611
DOES NOT THE SAGE SAY,

453
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,780
"WHAT IS MORE YIELDING
THAN WATER?

454
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,951
"YET BACK
IT COMES AGAIN,

455
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,019
"WEARING DOWN
THE RIGID STRENGTH

456
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:50,189
"WHICH CANNOT YIELD
TO WITHSTAND.

457
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:54,160
WHAT IS MORE FORCEFUL
THAN QUIET WATER?"

458
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,679
LOOK AT THEM.

459
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,814
HOW CAN YOU TRUST THEM?
GIDDY-UP.

460
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:19,085
I'M NOT ASKED
TO TRUST THEM.

461
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:41,874
STOP HER.

462
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,053
WHOA.

463
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:18,677
SO...YOU ARE
CAINE'S WOMAN.

464
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,712
MY HUSBAND
SPOKE ABOUT YOU.

465
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,483
I'M THE WOMAN
HE WORKS FOR...OR DID.

466
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,619
HE HAS THEN DECIDED
TO COME WITH US?

467
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,221
YOU'D BETTER
ASK HIM THAT.

468
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,360
SAY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

469
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,794
CHI CHING.

470
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,164
CAINE TOLD ME
ABOUT YOU.

471
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,266
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A PRINCESS BEFORE,

472
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,501
BUT YOU LOOK
LIKE ONE.

473
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,905
YOU DO NOT DRESS
LIKE THE OTHER
AMERICAN WOMEN.

474
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:49,208
WHY IS THAT?

475
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,643
I HAVE TO WORK
FOR A LIVING,
THAT'S WHY.

476
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,946
YOU ARE
A PEASANT, THEN?

477
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:55,447
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

478
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,084
I OWN 100 ACRES OF LAND,

479
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,419
AND I HAVE
NEAR 20 HEAD OF HORSES

480
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,521
AND MANY CATTLE.

481
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:03,990
THAT IS VERY MUCH.

482
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:06,658
YEAH, TOO MUCH FOR ME
TO HANDLE MYSELF.

483
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:10,562
YOU PEOPLE ARE TAKING AWAY
A GOOD HAND
AT A BAD TIME FOR ME.

484
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:14,466
IT WOULD ALWAYS BE
A BAD TIME FOR YOU
TO TAKE CAINE AWAY.

485
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:17,136
YOU CARE ABOUT HIM
VERY MUCH.

486
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:19,071
NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

487
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,140
I'VE SEEN THE WAY
YOU LOOK AT HIM.

488
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:25,944
I AM A WOMAN, TOO. WHAT I
DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW YOU
COULD CARE SO DEEPLY--

489
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:27,479
WHO SAID I CARED--

490
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:31,283
SO DEEPLY
ABOUT A MURDERER
AND A CRIMINAL.

491
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,853
I'VE KNOWN A LOT OF MEN,
AND NOT MANY
DECENT MEN AMONG THEM.

492
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,225
THIS MAN CAINE IS
THE DECENTEST, KINDEST
MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.

493
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:05,751
WELL, PRIEST,
WHAT HAVE YOU DECIDED?

494
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,553
I HAVE MADE
NO DECISION.

495
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,057
IS IT THAT YOU
DO NOT TRUST ME?

496
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:14,460
I AM CERTAIN YOU
CANNOT TELL A LIE.

497
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:15,561
WELL, THEN?

498
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:19,165
I HAVE RECEIVED
A PARDON FROM
THE EMPEROR.

499
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:22,934
NOW I NEED A PARDON
FROM HIS NEPHEW,
YOUR BROTHER.

500
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,071
BUT HE IS DEAD.
YOU KILLED HIM.

501
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,406
THAT IS WHY
I ASK HIS PARDON.

502
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:32,078
HOW CAN YOU ASK PARDON
OF A DEAD MAN?

503
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:36,014
HAVE YOU NOT
SOMETIMES TALKED
WITH THE DEAD?

504
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:37,849
YOUR ANCESTORS?

505
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,785
WHAT HAVE THEY
TO DO WITH THIS?

506
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,821
IT IS THE PRINCIPLE
I SPEAK OF.

507
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,823
DO YOU THINK
HE WILL HEAR YOU?

508
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,525
IF HE THINKS ME
WORTHY.

509
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,128
POOR PRIEST.

510
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,464
YOU DO NOT
THINK ME WORTHY?

511
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,367
I THINK
YOU'RE A FOOL.

512
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,727
IS ANYTHING
WRONG, LADY?

513
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,296
WRONG? WHAT
SHOULD BE WRONG?

514
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:26,031
I DON'T KNOW,
LADY.

515
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:27,065
SILLY GIRL.

516
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,700
DID I SAY ANYTHING
WAS WRONG?

517
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,502
NO, LADY.

518
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,505
THEN STOP PRATTLING
AND COME AND FIX
MY HAIR.

519
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,349
WELL, LAD,
WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

520
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:48,120
STILL SUSPICIOUS?

521
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,190
I BELIEVE, CAPTAIN,

522
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,259
THAT YOUR WIFE

523
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,127
CAN ONLY SPEAK
THE TRUTH.

524
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:58,664
WHICH IS AS MUCH TO SAY
THAT I DO NOT?

525
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,332
I MEAN NO OFFENSE.

526
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,435
I WILL NOT SURRENDER
MY FINGER.

527
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:07,105
LAD, THAT'S NONE OF MY DOING.
I HAVE NO USE
FOR THAT KIND--

528
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,309
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE GOING?

529
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:15,113
IF YOU HAVE ROOM
FOR ME, I WILL GO.

530
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,349
SPLENDID.

531
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,518
Woman: OH! LADY!
THE DEMON!

532
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,223
Gage: MURPHY, TRAN CHOU!
QUICK! UPSTAIRS!

533
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,801
WHY DID YOU SCREAM?

534
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,641
I COULD NOT HELP
MYSELF, LADY.

535
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,610
TO SCREAMS ERUPT
FROM YOUR BODY,
THEN, AT WILL?

536
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,912
WHEN I SAW
THE DEMON UPON
THE WINDOWSILL--

537
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:22,248
IT WAS NO DEMON.

538
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,950
BUT, LADY, IT WAS.
DID YOU NOT SEE
ITS EYES?

539
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,984
I SAW.

540
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,786
IT WAS THE EYES
OF A DEMON.

541
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,422
FOOLISH GIRL,
DEMONS ARE FOR CHILDREN.

542
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,190
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?

543
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:36,295
IT WAS...
WHAT?

544
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:40,932
NO MATTER.
TAKE THE BOXES
DOWNSTAIRS.

545
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,661
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT BIRD
WAS THE SPIRIT
OF MY DEAD BROTHER?

546
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,131
DO YOU?

547
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:15,267
YOU ASK TOO MUCH,
PRIEST.

548
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:17,536
YOU EXPECT
A MURDERED MAN

549
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,505
TO FORGIVE
HIS MURDERER.

550
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,475
WHO ELSE CAN?

551
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:26,812
ISN'T IT ENOUGH
TO BE PARDONED
BY THE EMPEROR?

552
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,549
IT IS A GREAT HONOR.

553
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:32,384
IT IS VERY GENEROUS
OF THE EMPEROR

554
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:35,186
TO PARDON YOU
IN THAT WAY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

555
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,055
TO FULFILL
A PROMISE.

556
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,358
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO
KEEP HIS PROMISE.

557
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,192
AN EMPEROR DOESN'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

558
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,796
UNLIKE SEA CAPTAINS'
WIVES, WHO HAVE TO LEARN
THE VIRTUE OF SILENCE.

559
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:10,121
WE HAVE HIM, LOVE.

560
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:11,957
WE DO NOT WISH TO
FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY.

561
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,026
YOU SEE, THE TRICK
IS TO GET HIM
IN MOTION.

562
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,362
ONCE UNDERWAY,
HIS MOMENTUM

563
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,397
WILL CARRY HIM
TO THE SHIP,

564
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,632
THEN THERE
IS NOWHERE ELSE
FOR HIM TO GO

565
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,133
BUT TO THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.

566
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,569
YOU SHOULD'VE
LET ME SHOOT HIM.

567
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,136
NO, NO, NO,
MY LOVE.

568
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,238
THAT WOULD
GET IN MY WAY.

569
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,307
YOU'RE A PRINCESS.

570
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,610
DON'T LET
HIS FOOLISHNESS
UNNERVE YOU.

571
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,178
DO NOT CALL IT
FOOLISHNESS.

572
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,046
WHAT IS IT, THEN?
SPIRITS AND DEMONS?

573
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,548
A SPIRIT
IS NOT A DEMON.

574
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:38,450
AND A CROW
IS NOT A SPIRIT!

575
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,252
AND IT WAS A CROW,
A SIMPLE, UGLY BIRD.

576
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,021
THE LAND
IS FULL OF THEM.

577
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:45,791
CHI...

578
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,763
ARE WE QUARRELING
OVER A BIRD?

579
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,337
YOU KNOW, MY LOVE,

580
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:02,040
I WOULD GLADLY
EXCHANGE THIS CROW...

581
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:06,378
ANYTIME...

582
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,013
FOR MY CROW'S NEST...

583
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,016
AND CHINA.

584
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,389
BUT DO NOT FORGET
HOW MUCH

585
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:19,891
A GRATEFUL EMPEROR
CAN DO FOR US.

586
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,432
MY LOVE.

587
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,552
KWAI CHANG, YOU
ONLY DECIDED TO COME

588
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,120
WHEN I TOLD YOU
WHO WROTE THE PARDON?

589
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,255
YES.

590
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,658
MY HUSBAND TOLD YOU
THE SAME THING.

591
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,926
DID YOU NOT
BELIEVE HIM?

592
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,094
NO.

593
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,896
YET YOU BELIEVE ME?

594
00:39:57,963 --> 00:39:59,631
YES.

595
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:02,167
WHY SHOULDN'T
I LIE?

596
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,236
YOU HAVE
NO NEED TO LIE.

597
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,673
BUT I MIGHT LIE.
ENOUGH!

598
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,310
BUT I DIDN'T.

599
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,179
OH, LADY!
THE DEMON!

600
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,555
AAH! MAKE HIM GO!
MAKE HIM GO!

601
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:26,792
I'LL DO AS YOU SAY!
YOU CAN HAVE MY HAND!

602
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:30,428
BUT IT MAY BE TOO LATE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

603
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:32,631
I DON'T CARE.

604
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:34,566
TRY THE GODS.
I BEG OF YOU--

605
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:39,771
GO TELL MASTER KAN,
AND GO TO THE LAUNDRY
AND GET CLEAN RAGS. HURRY.

606
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,153
Gage: KILL IT.
DO NOT SHOOT.

607
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,590
YOU HAVE ORDERS, MAN.
PUT THE BEAST
OUT OF HIS MISERY.

608
00:40:58,657 --> 00:41:01,527
NO. IT IS THE SPIRIT
OF MY DEAD BROTHER.

609
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,795
IT'S THE WART
ON MY GREAT-AUNT'S NOSE.

610
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:07,198
PUT IT AWAY, MURPHY,
WITH A BULLET DOWN
ITS UGLY GIZZARD.

611
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:09,535
NO!

612
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:10,969
DO IT, MAN, NOW.

613
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:12,203
PLEASE.

614
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:21,747
Murphy: FINE SHOOTING,
CAPTAIN.

615
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,115
NOT BAD, EH?
HAVEN'T LOST
THE TOUCH.

616
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:27,586
MURDERER.

617
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:28,620
YOU KILLED HIM!

618
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:30,756
USE YOUR HEAD,
PRINCESS.

619
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,023
IF THIS WAS
A SPIRIT,

620
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,125
COULD A BULLET
HAVE BROUGHT
IT DOWN?

621
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,862
BY YOUR OWN
LIKES, MY PET,

622
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:41,366
THIS WAS NO
ROYAL-BLOODED,
IMPERIAL SPIRIT

623
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,134
TO COME TUMBLING
DOWN LIKE THAT.

624
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,636
NAY, ME LOVE.

625
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,106
AAH!

626
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:56,081
KWAI CHANG,
IT IS ALL A LIE.
THERE IS NO PARDON.

627
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:59,551
IF YOU GO BACK TO CHINA,
YOU WILL BE KILLED.

628
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:02,420
I KNEW YOU WOULD
NOT LIE TO ME.

629
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:05,090
A CROW,
AFTER ALL.

630
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:06,291
I AM SORRY.

631
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,727
I WOULD HAVE WISHED
IT WERE TRUE.

632
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,562
THE EMPEROR DID
WRITE THOSE WORDS,

633
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:12,564
BUT HE DIDN'T MEAN
TO HONOR THEM.

634
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:14,532
THAT'S WHY I TRIED
TO KILL YOU.

635
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,368
YOU REALIZE, ME BUCKO,
I CANNOT LET YOU GO.

636
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:18,637
WHY?

637
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:22,007
AH, I RISKED
MY GOOD NAME
WITH THE EMPEROR

638
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,174
TO WIN HER.

639
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,410
SHE'S PART
OF THE PAYOFF,
DON'T YOU SEE?

640
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,245
AN ADVANCE,
SO TO SPEAK.

641
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:28,880
I'VE INVESTED
TOO MUCH.

642
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:35,053
TOO MUCH
BEAUTIFUL PLANNING
TO LOSE IT NOW.

643
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,288
THE OLD MAN'S RING,

644
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:41,259
THE ARTFUL LITTLE THING
ABOUT THE FINGER.
POTENTIAL, EH?

645
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:42,761
IT WAS WHY
I BELIEVED YOU.

646
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:44,930
NO MATTER WHY,
CHANG CAINE.

647
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:47,766
WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
IN PEKING.

648
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,534
PLEASE,
INTO THE COACH.

649
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:52,470
I WOULD BE FOOLISH
TO DO SO.

650
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:54,640
BELAY THAT.
THIS IS FOR ME.

651
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,810
Liu: MASTER KYU,

652
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:40,946
I WAS SO MUCH
TROUBLE FOR YOU.

653
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,648
YOU WERE
MUCH MORE TROUBLE

654
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:44,950
FOR YOURSELF, LIU.

655
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,786
I SEE NOTHING
TO GIVE THANKS FOR.

656
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,087
I BROUGHT YOU MY HUSBAND,

657
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,289
WHO HAD A HAND AND AN ARM,

658
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,325
AND YOU RETURN TO ME A MAN
WHO IS HALF HIMSELF!

659
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:56,227
WOMAN, BE STILL.

660
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,665
AND YOU, BOY,

661
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:04,035
THANKS FOR KEEPING VIGIL
SO LONG WITH ME.

662
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:09,174
MASTER.

663
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,344
Liu: COME, WOMAN.

664
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:22,187
MASTER...

665
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:25,256
WHY WAS THE SPIRIT
NOT SATISFIED
WITH LIU'S HAND?

666
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,894
THE SPIRIT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN,

667
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,463
BUT LIU HIMSELF
HAD NOT DONE
WITH GAMBLING.

668
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,299
HE REFUSED,
AS WE RECALL,

669
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:36,034
TO LET ME HELP HIM.

670
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:39,037
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

671
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,339
WHAT DID
THE SPIRIT WANT?

672
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:42,908
THAT WE MAY NOT KNOW,

673
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:44,843
ONLY WHAT THEY DO.

674
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:47,245
BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR

675
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:49,948
THAT THE FINGER
WAS LOST FOOLISHLY,

676
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:52,683
AND THAT ANGERED
THE SPIRIT OF THE FINGER,

677
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,786
TO BE RIPPED
WANTONLY OFF

678
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:58,289
WITH SO MANY GOOD YEARS
OF WORK LEFT IN IT.

679
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:01,492
BUT TO TAKE THE ARM
AND SAVE THE LIFE,

680
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,294
THAT APPEASED THE SPIRIT,

681
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:05,196
FOR IT WAS A GOOD LOSS.

682
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:09,134
THE SPIRIT DECIDED
TO LET LIU LIVE.

683
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,770
SOMETIMES WE MUST LOSE
PART OF A GAMBLE

684
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:15,173
IN ORDER TO WIN
IN THE END.

685
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:19,044
MASTER, LIU MIGHT
NOT HAVE CONSENTED

686
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,679
TO THE LOSS
OF HIS ARM...

687
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:24,215
EXCEPT FOR
THE APPEARANCE
OF THE CROW.

688
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,717
YET THE CROW
DID APPEAR.

689
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,654
AND ON THE FLOOR
OF THE SICKROOM,

690
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,056
I FOUND THIS.

691
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,798
LIU BELIEVED
IN HIS DEMONS

692
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:44,202
BY HIS OWN CHOICE,
NOT BY OURS.

693
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:46,271
IF THE APPEARANCE
OF ONE OF HIS DEMONS

694
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:48,874
HELPED HIM MAKE
THE RIGHT CHOICE,

695
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,541
THEN WE CAN ONLY
BE GRATEFUL

696
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,710
FOR THE WAYS
OF PROVIDENCE.

697
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,245
CAN WE NOT?

698
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:17,502
ALRIGHT, LAD.
IT'S OVER.

699
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:18,769
THERE IS A TIME

700
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,106
WHEN EVEN AN EMPEROR
MUST BE DISOBEYED.

701
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,344
I AM SATISFIED
THAT THE AFFAIR OF HONOR
BETWEEN US IS OVER.

702
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:36,187
I'VE NEVER MET
A MAN LIKE YOU.

703
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:37,255
HA HA HA.

704
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:40,825
I SWEAR, I ADMIRE YOU
MORE THAN I CAN SAY,

705
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42,393
BUT...

706
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,929
WHEW!

707
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:47,999
I WOULDN'T BE YOU

708
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,401
FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.

709
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,572
WILL THEY BE
IN TROUBLE WHEN
THEY GET HOME?

710
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,608
THE EMPEROR
IS VENGEFUL,

711
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:06,244
BUT THEY HAVE
EACH OTHER,

712
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:08,579
AND THEY HAVE
THE SHIP.

713
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,382
Ellie: I GUESS THE FENCE
WILL NEVER BE FINISHED.

714
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,518
I WILL FINISH IT
BEFORE I GO.

715
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:14,852
DON'T.

716
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:17,355
YOUR HORSES
WILL STRAY.

717
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:18,489
LET THEM.

718
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,429
WILL YOU EVER
COME BACK?

719
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:28,099
LIFE IS LONG.

720
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:32,137
WILL YOU EVER
BELONG TO ANYONE?

721
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,741
NO MAN CAN
GIVE HIMSELF AWAY.

722
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,313
I WOULD.
