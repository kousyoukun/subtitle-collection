1
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:50,384
Keep away from me.

2
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,454
Do not be afraid.

3
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,627
Do not be afraid.

4
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,314
Don't!

5
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:38,532
Close your eyes and I will see
for both of us.

6
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,562
Alright, mister,
we'll take her now.

7
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,873
It's time to
go home, Gwyneth.

8
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,781
It's time to go.

9
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,671
Your tread must
be light and sure...

10
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,508
...as though your path
were upon rice paper.

11
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:07,114
It is said a Shaolin priest
can walk through walls.

12
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,883
Looked for, he cannot be seen.

13
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,220
Listened for,
he cannot be heard.

14
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:16,690
Touched, he cannot be felt.

15
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,493
This rice paper is the test.

16
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,596
Fragile as the wings
of the dragonfly.

17
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,932
Clinging as the cocoon
of the silkworm.

18
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:31,038
When you can walk its length
and leave no trace...

19
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,773
...you will have learned.

20
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,912
It's time to go now.

21
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,033
Get her! We can't afford
to lose her again.

22
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,381
-She was in chains.
-Of course she's in chains.

23
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,215
She's a patient
from a mental asylum...

24
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,351
...she has
to be restrained.

25
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:28,396
Devil! Devil! What have you
done with the priests?

26
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,339
You think I don't know.

27
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,642
I heard the scratching
in the wall.

28
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,113
You sealed the priests in
the wall behind my room.

29
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:53,487
Now they listen to me.
They listen to me.

30
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:57,024
I can't sleep,
thinking about it.

31
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,362
I can't sleep.

32
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,371
I will help you to sleep.

33
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,013
No! Poison!

34
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,805
When you have rested,
we can talk.

35
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,924
Master...

36
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,694
...what besets that man?

37
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:11,732
He has been marked
to wander inward...

38
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:15,803
...through and beyond the dark
and terrifying land...

39
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:23,143
...where no road exists
and no signpost points the way.

40
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,079
But why?

41
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,882
Who can say?

42
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,387
Should he not be locked
in his room?

43
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,824
And prevented from his journey?

44
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,727
If he can pass through
the trackless land...

45
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:45,298
...he will find peace,
his answer, his cure.

46
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:50,504
As far as we are able,
we must travel with him...

47
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,874
...help him along his way.

48
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:57,745
But how, when there are
no roads and no signposts?

49
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,181
There are steps, his and ours.

50
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,652
We take them together.

51
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:10,090
This is our duty to all
who are marked, as he is.

52
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,827
I should hope then never
to meet another like him.

53
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:17,798
Very often, a wanderer
in the trackless land...

54
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,968
...finds that which he sought
and more...

55
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:25,673
...something of rare value for
the one who shared his journey.

56
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:30,778
Could you risk the loss
of such a benefit?

57
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,568
Parker!

58
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,978
Fight's all run out of her.
Get the horses.

59
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,308
You will lock her up
in your asylum?

60
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,348
Well, look at her, down on
all fours like an animal.

61
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,684
She has a journey to complete.

62
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,253
I cannot let you take her.

63
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,022
Stand aside.

64
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,327
Get her.

65
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,258
Leave him alone.

66
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,895
He's crazier than she is.

67
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,931
You want her that bad,
you can keep her. Let's go.

68
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,856
They are gone.

69
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,277
Where have you
seen these signs?

70
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,882
In my dreams,
and awake sometimes.

71
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:58,018
What do they mean to you?

72
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,854
They're the mark of a devil
that makes me see things...

73
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,189
...that aren't there.

74
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,424
You see things
that other people do not?

75
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,093
Yes.

76
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:11,398
Didn't you hear Dr. Tracer
say I'm crazy?

77
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,967
These are herbs, medicine.

78
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,970
They will make your wrists heal
without scarring.

79
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:31,919
Once I met a stone carver who
had been blind from birth.

80
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,224
His carvings were of beautiful,
fierce beasts.

81
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,893
No one with eyes had ever
seen such beasts.

82
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,096
Yet he who could
not see saw them.

83
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,232
He must have been crazy too.

84
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,535
He was gifted.

85
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,279
Why are you afraid of me?
Have I hurt you?

86
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,315
No, but you will.

87
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,052
You'll destroy me.

88
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,420
Why?

89
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,858
I don't know.

90
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,426
Have I not just treated you
as a friend?

91
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,664
Shall I tell you
why I will help you?

92
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,066
Why?

93
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,401
I will, in time,
ask you a question...

94
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,436
...which you may
be able to answer.

95
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,805
What question?

96
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:28,141
You are not ready
to answer yet.

97
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,216
-What's your name?
-I am Caine.

98
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,152
And you?

99
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,554
Gwyneth.

100
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,556
It's a Welsh name.

101
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,459
Supposed to mean
someone who's blessed.

102
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,930
It doesn't suit me very well.

103
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,902
You have a home?

104
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:58,939
An aunt and uncle.
They have a farm north of here.

105
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,474
I wouldn't call it home.

106
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,512
We should go.

107
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,215
No, not there.

108
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,583
They will wish
to know you are safe.

109
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,522
Can I just stay with you?

110
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,836
Caine, please don't
take me home.

111
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,371
We are close then?

112
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,007
You're gonna take me there
and leave me, aren't you?

113
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:37,945
I have told you, I have
a question to ask you.

114
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,980
In time, I will ask it.

115
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,249
Until then, I will
stay with you.

116
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,585
Alright.

117
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,490
There.

118
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,192
Isn't it beautiful?

119
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,518
By Saint Asaph, she's taken up
with a Chinaman.

120
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,395
That's my aunt and uncle.

121
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,897
What are we gonna
do, Mr. Jenkins?

122
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,765
She looks so thin.

123
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,334
Never mind how she looks.

124
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:37,270
I will not have her
in my house again.

125
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,406
I understand
your feelings, Mr. Jenkins...

126
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,341
...but since your accident...

127
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,377
...we could use an extra pair
of hands around the place.

128
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,055
He probably thinks
you're crazy too.

129
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:02,795
Did they let you
out of that place?

130
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,631
I ran away.

131
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,100
Why did you come back here?

132
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,338
-You are her family.
-Both look so hungry.

133
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,041
And the girl could do
with a clean dress.

134
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,677
A Chinaman, eating supper
at my table?

135
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,949
The Bible says we must practice
Christian charity.

136
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,719
Just a bite to eat and a place
to sleep for a night.

137
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,727
We rebuilt the house
down the road there.

138
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,197
You come along,
and we'll have a talk.

139
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,861
They hate me.

140
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,730
No.

141
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,265
They fear you.

142
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,413
Do all your countrymen
abstain from...

143
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,349
...the eating
of meat, Mr. Caine?

144
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,685
No. It is a personal choice.

145
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,855
How come you don't wear
a long pigtail down your back?

146
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,024
Uncle.

147
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,893
That too is a personal choice.

148
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,196
You are a choosing man,
aren't you?

149
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,109
-I'll help you, Aunt Mary.
-Sit down.

150
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,248
You're not right in
the head yet, are you?

151
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,617
I don't know how
to answer that.

152
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,123
Your aunt and I have
been thinking...

153
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,159
...maybe you could stay.

154
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,860
We'd try it again.

155
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,365
Stay?

156
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,837
Tell her to stop staring at me.

157
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,275
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything.

158
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,577
You were staring at me
with that evil eye.

159
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,612
If you don't keep
her away from me...

160
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,249
...you can get
yourself another man.

161
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,551
Now look what you've done.

162
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,987
I won't have any
of your funny business, now.

163
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,689
I'll send you back, you hear?

164
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,960
-What did you see?
-Nothing.

165
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,429
Trust me.

166
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,732
I didn't see anything.
I swear it!

167
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,534
Aunt Mary, I didn't.

168
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,505
You frighten me, child.

169
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,907
As God is my witness,
you frighten me.

170
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,918
Frank!

171
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,241
-Where is she?
-Resting.

172
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,951
She can't stay here, Caine.
That's out.

173
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:50,457
You see, we don't even know
if she's really our niece.

174
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,326
She came to our doorstep
one morning, 20-years-old...

175
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,994
...looking more Injun
than white.

176
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,797
She claimed that her father
was my brother.

177
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:01,067
And she told me his name,
and that the family was dead.

178
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,702
I don't know how she found us.

179
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,537
She cost Mr. Jenkins
lotta of money.

180
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:07,407
He had to buy her from
those Indians she was with.

181
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,242
Well, I felt it was my duty.

182
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,177
But she wasn't
right in the head...

183
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,812
from the day we got her.

184
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:16,349
And then, finally,
she burned the house down.

185
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,918
You are certain
Gwyneth did this?

186
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,821
-I am. And that's not all.
-There are other things.

187
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,924
Like, she tells you things
before they come to pass.

188
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:28,561
She sees things,
and then she makes them happen.

189
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,933
You can both stay
here tonight...

190
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,270
...but you'll have to
be gone by morning.

191
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:40,573
Watch out for her.
See she doesn't start anything.

192
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,906
-What is it?
-Frank. He's coming back.

193
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,116
-Which way?
-Leave me alone.

194
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,150
You've seen something.

195
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,486
-Look at it.
-No.

196
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,053
Look at it.

197
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,092
I saw him falling
from his horse.

198
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,828
Please stop me before I make
this happen again.

199
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:12,198
Seeing something does not
cause it to happen.

200
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,800
Where is Frank now?

201
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,658
You're she-wolf.
Who'll you murder next?

202
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,360
It was an accident.

203
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,463
We'll see what
the sheriff calls it.

204
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,919
Some food and my jar of money.

205
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:43,089
Take her away before my husband
comes back with the law.

206
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,292
I cannot accept money.

207
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,596
It's for her.
A woman has needs.

208
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,038
How can you look at me?

209
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:02,742
Something evil inside me,
turning me into a monster.

210
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,613
We must go.

211
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,587
Mr. Caine.

212
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,358
There's peacefulness in you.

213
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,160
Help her if you can.

214
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,851
Caine.

215
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:00,299
What are you doing?

216
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,834
Thinking.

217
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:07,139
What will you do now?
Where do you wish to go?

218
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,078
I don't know.

219
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:16,949
There's no place,
no one...but you.

220
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:29,528
No. No.

221
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,800
You. You tricked me.

222
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:39,205
I thought you were good,
but you're evil.

223
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,843
Evil. Evil! Evil!

224
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:16,743
Master, why do such
fearsome statues stand...

225
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,911
...at the entrance
to our peaceful place?

226
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,714
These are the threshold
guardians, grasshopper...

227
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,582
...set here
to keep away those...

228
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,719
...not ready for
the silence within.

229
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:30,657
Must they be so horrible?

230
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,258
Those incapable
of understanding...

231
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,662
...the way see things
divine as monsters.

232
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:38,564
Better for them never
to enter here.

233
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:41,000
Yet, if a man
is unafraid of stone...

234
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,302
...he may pass unhampered.

235
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,638
He may physically pass
the guardian.

236
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,940
But if his mind is
in the outer world...

237
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,977
...he will leave us,
in time, to rejoin it.

238
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,309
Why did you follow me?

239
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:02,314
Are you ready
to ask your question now?

240
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,516
Not yet.

241
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,054
It's an evil thing you'll ask,
because you're evil.

242
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:11,190
Gwyneth.

243
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,627
You must stop running away from
everything...

244
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,497
...you do not understand.

245
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,666
You must give in to your dreams.

246
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,802
Listen to what they tell you.

247
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,907
I'm so tired.

248
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:34,346
Soon, you will come to
the end of your journey.

249
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:39,018
You will go beyond your fears
and find peace.

250
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,897
You saw these signs
before we met?

251
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,136
That was your deeper self
giving you a message.

252
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,978
-Can you take the dreams away?
-No.

253
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:09,481
I can help you
to understand them.

254
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:25,898
Breathe slowly, deeply,
as if you were floating.

255
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,871
I'm afraid.

256
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,843
Don't make me see this.

257
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,777
What do you see?

258
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,054
It's an awful place.

259
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:54,026
It's dark and still.

260
00:29:56,495 --> 00:30:00,967
It looks like people lying
on tree branches.

261
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:04,103
Death is everywhere.
We shouldn't be here.

262
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,712
It's changing.

263
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:17,483
A place called Blue Ridge Pass,
I think.

264
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,819
Mountains.

265
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:25,624
Caine, don't make me see
any more of this.

266
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,860
I feel cold all over.

267
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,429
What is beyond the pass?

268
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,605
I'm numb. I can't feel
my body. Caine!

269
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,913
Beyond the pass, go there.

270
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:54,353
A wagon...

271
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,155
...with settlers.

272
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,858
A big family.

273
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:02,528
Do you know them?

274
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,330
No.

275
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,339
Someone's attacking
with fire arrows.

276
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:51,243
Speak English.
This is my friend.

277
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,146
-You know each other?
-He's my brother.

278
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,655
Black Horse is dead.

279
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:08,360
-When?
-In the Moon of the Snowblind.

280
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:16,468
By his last words,
he wished this for you.

281
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:22,174
You always wanted it,
you keep it.

282
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:27,713
Only those who have had thunder
visions may act as heyokas.

283
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,420
There is sickness among us.

284
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,755
Meat is scarce.

285
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:41,727
The Grandfather punishes us for
selling you back to your people.

286
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,564
I'm only woman, Tall Fire.
What can I do?

287
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,300
Come back with us now.

288
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:51,770
We know of the life you had
with the  wasicus.

289
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,972
We offer you a life with honor.

290
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,276
I'd rather die first.

291
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,104
Who is Black Horse?

292
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:30,409
Their heyoka,
the sacred fool.

293
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:33,712
He was my father
while I lived with them.

294
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,748
He adopted me when he heard
of my dreams.

295
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,152
I'm sorry he's dead.

296
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:46,192
-Where is the Blue Ridge Pass?
-I don't know. It's only words.

297
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,128
You know.

298
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,365
That way, three days.

299
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:58,237
Perhaps we should go there.

300
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:00,406
There's something horrible
there, Caine...

301
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,208
...something dark and terrible.

302
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,443
If I see it,
I'll die, I know it.

303
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,114
I feel it, like a chill all
the way to my soul.

304
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,516
When a fear
becomes strong enough...

305
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:13,719
...it is like another
being within you...

306
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,588
...who fights to stay alive.

307
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:20,259
It is not you who will die,
Gwyneth, it is your fear.

308
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,814
Where'd you come from?

309
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,416
Outside.

310
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:47,586
I know that.
The stage ain't due for a week.

311
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:52,057
I didn't hear
any horses or a wagon.

312
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,092
We walked.

313
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,694
It's not possible.

314
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,865
Don't mind that.
It ain't real.

315
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,335
I got that done by
a professional, back East.

316
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:07,573
Scares Indians. Big medicine.
Keeps me safe.

317
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,576
What can I do for you?

318
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:15,147
Can you tell us the way
to Blue Ridge Pass, please?

319
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,420
Day's ride, straight
into the sunset.

320
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:26,158
Mountains rise blue
on either side of the pass.

321
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:29,127
Lots of spruce up
that way too.

322
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:31,597
But that's hostile
territory, mister.

323
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,233
No one goes up there. No one.

324
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:40,239
Thank you.

325
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,579
This was our winter campground.

326
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,216
I've never seen it
this time of year.

327
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,353
A friend?

328
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,290
My sister.

329
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:33,459
We lived as captives
of the Sioux.

330
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:38,196
For a while, at least,
we had each other.

331
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:39,631
When they learned
about my dreams...

332
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,467
...Black Horse took me
to the lodge...

333
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,002
...and made me his daughter.

334
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:47,339
Emily was treated like a slave,
while I was privileged.

335
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,377
After a year...

336
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:54,280
...she died from the hardship.

337
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:58,284
What of your mother and father?

338
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,755
I don't know.

339
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:08,226
I remember being
with them in Wales.

340
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:09,928
They must have died.

341
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,967
I kept her dress.

342
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:17,603
Nobody knew.

343
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,241
One night, I thought...

344
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,678
...if I burned the dress...

345
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:29,681
...I'd burn the memory.

346
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,885
The fire in your uncle's house?

347
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,323
Yeah.

348
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:07,653
We're getting close.
I don't want to go any farther.

349
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,295
Caine.

350
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:18,964
-I want to stop.
-No.

351
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,666
I can't breathe.

352
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:30,175
It's like a weight pressing down
on me. I'm suffocating.

353
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,679
Caine, I'm suffocating.
I'm suffocating.

354
00:38:56,702 --> 00:39:00,606
Your heart beats too fast.
You must quiet it.

355
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,412
What frightened you?

356
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:11,817
I heard the silence, master.

357
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:17,423
I felt my whole being diffuse,
like a cloud.

358
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:21,960
Then rain fell from
the sky through me.

359
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:26,865
I was part of everything,
yet I was myself.

360
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,102
You have experienced oneness.

361
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,973
Yes, master.

362
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,908
But in this great joy...

363
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,779
...I felt as if I was dying.

364
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:42,848
That is what frightened me.

365
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:05,070
You know the lesson
of the silkworm?

366
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,907
The silkworm dies,
the moth lives...

367
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:13,378
...yet they are not two separate
beings, but one and the same.

368
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:15,547
It is the same with man.

369
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,983
His false beliefs must die...

370
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:21,553
...so that he may know
the joy of the way.

371
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,956
What you felt in
the silence was real.

372
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:29,427
Something in you is dying.
It is called ignorance.

373
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,845
This is sacred ground.

374
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:49,581
No one may enter but a holy man.

375
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,483
We can't go any farther.

376
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,419
After we have gone through...

377
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:57,923
...perhaps you will be able
to tell me what I must know.

378
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:29,487
No.

379
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,829
Oh!

380
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,565
Oh!

381
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:19,137
Oh, no.

382
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:33,084
My mother and father died here.

383
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,723
They tried to protect us
with their bodies.

384
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:43,394
I could feel the weight
of her body on top of me.

385
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:46,197
I couldn't breathe.

386
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:48,834
I knew she was dead.

387
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,637
I wanted her to be alive again.

388
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,024
The wagon...

389
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,628
...in my vision,
it wasn't in this train.

390
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,899
No wagon in this train
had that many children.

391
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,068
Are you certain?

392
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,804
Yes. No wagon had
that many children.

393
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:29,300
You cannot go through this way.

394
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:32,237
It's free open land, I'll go
where I please.

395
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:14,145
Stop!

396
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,049
Peace.

397
00:45:19,617 --> 00:45:22,587
These people will not violate
the sacred ground.

398
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,456
The daughter of Black Horse
bids you let them be.

399
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:31,396
Alright. Kids.

400
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:45,777
Mister, I owe you an apology.

401
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:53,852
How did you know, and I didn't?

402
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:57,388
Without fear,
one sees more clearly.

403
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:02,127
Your vision is not a curse.
It is a gift.

404
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,095
It saved those people's lives.

405
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:15,874
I'm not afraid anymore.

406
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,811
You have come to the end
of your journey.

407
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:35,760
You've walked
with me step by step.

408
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:39,030
And now I've left my fears
behind me.

409
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:41,799
I must go back and serve my
people now.

410
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:47,105
You have found
what you were seeking.

411
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,174
Peace for yourself.

412
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,078
It was once said to me...

413
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,313
...that if I shared
a journey such as yours...

414
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,951
...at the end, I might find
something of value for myself.

415
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:03,054
-Your question?
-Yes, it is time.

416
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:08,960
Since coming to this land,
I have searched for my brother.

417
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:13,131
Now I wonder
if my search is idle.

418
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,969
Tell me if he still lives.

419
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:26,844
Oh, Caine, after all
you've done for me...

420
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:28,613
...I can't answer
your question.

421
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,681
Please try.

422
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:33,584
-How?
-Think.

423
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:35,120
Look.

424
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,523
I need to know.

425
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,433
Oh, please, just this once.

426
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,343
Oh, Caine. You've done so much
for me. If I could--

427
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,517
Nothing.

428
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,253
Nothing.

429
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,390
Oh, poor Danny, if I could
just help you in some way.

430
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:15,660
I have not told you his name.

431
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,571
Yes, he lives.
And you'll find him.

432
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,279
Oh, Caine.
