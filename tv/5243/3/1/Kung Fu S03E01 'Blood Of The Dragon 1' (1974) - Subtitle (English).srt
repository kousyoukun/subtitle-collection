00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,324
YAH!

2
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,735
YAH...HAH!

3
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,238
YAH!

4
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,466
BRING ME...

5
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,771
SUN LO, WONG TI,
HAN SU LOK.

6
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:07,288

00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,957
TO SERVE OUR ORDER--

8
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,093
THE ORDER OF
THE AVENGING DRAGON.

9
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,599
YOU ARE SWORN TO WIPE OUT
THE STAIN UPON OUR HONOR

10
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,935
AS GUARDIANS
OF THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD,

11
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:27,575
FOR OUR FAILURE TO PROTECT
THE LIFE OF THE IMPERIAL NEPHEW,

12
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,043
SUN LO

13
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,112
WONG TI

00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,747
HAN SU LOK

15
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:37,150
WE, YOUR BROTHERS

16
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,821
CALL UPON YOU
TO FULFILL YOUR OATH.

17
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,923
YOUR PROVEN EXCELLENCE

18
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:49,229
IN SEPARATE SKILLS HAVE EARNED
YOU THE SACRED PRIVILEGE

19
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:52,900
OF BEING THE FIRST
TO BE SENT FORTH.

20
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:59,473
THE ORDER COMPELS YOU TO LEAVE
AT ONCE FOR AMERICA.

21
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:06,246
SOMEWHERE WITHIN THAT
COUNTRY'S WESTERN LANDS,

22
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:10,684
THE MAN WHO HAS DISHONORED US
WANDERS AT WILL

23
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:16,324
SEPARATED FROM OUR VENGEANCE
BY A GREAT OCEAN.

24
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,627
YOU MUST CROSS THE WATERS
OF THAT OCEAN

25
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:23,397
SEARCH OUT THIS MAN
WHO HAS DISHONORED US,

26
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:28,268
AND DESTROY HIM AT THE COST
OF YOUR LIVES

27
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:31,972
THIS RENEGADE SHAOLIN PRIEST...

28
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:37,711
KWAI CHANG CAINE.

29
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,930
Master Kan: YOUR TREAD

30
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,599
MUST BE LIGHT AND SHORT

31
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:36,103
AS THOUGH YOUR PATH
WERE UPON RICE PAPER.

32
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,708
IT IS SAID A SHAOLIN PRIEST
CAN WALK THROUGH WALLS...

33
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,444
LOOKED FOR, HE CANNOT BE SEEN...

34
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:46,980
LISTENED FOR,
HE CANNOT BE HEARD...

35
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:50,350
TOUCHED, HE CANNOT BE FELT.

36
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:53,253
THIS RICE PAPER IS THE TEST--

37
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,490
FRAGILE AS THE WINGS
OF THE DRAGONFLY,

38
00:05:56,557 --> 00:06:00,461
CLINGING AS A COCOON
OF THE SILKWORM.

39
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:04,632
WHEN YOU CAN WALK ITS LENGTH
AND LEAVE NO TRACE

40
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,066
YOU WILL HAVE LEARNED.

41
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,649
WHERE'D YOU
COME FROM?

42
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,984
A MAN HAS DIED HERE
LAST NIGHT.

43
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,920
THAT'S NEWS TO ME.

44
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,522
UH, SHERIFF...

45
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,695
MATTER OF FACT,
A MAN DID DIE.

46
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,631
HE IS HERE
IN THIS BUILDING.

47
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,733
NOW, LISTEN,
I DON'T--

48
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,540
MATTER OF FACT,
HE IS.

49
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,142
VINNIE WAS FIGURING
ON PUTTING HIM AWAY
TOMORROW.

50
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,278
I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE THE BODY.

51
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,581
WHY?

52
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:57,618
I BELIEVE IT IS
SOMEONE I HAVE KNOWN.

53
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:02,089
WELL, THAT'S MORE THAN
THE REST OF US CAN SAY.

54
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,693
THE WAY IT IS,
I'VE BEEN AWAY
MOST OF THE DAY.

55
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,129
WE FOUND HIM IN A SHACK
OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

56
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:12,566
LOOKS LIKE HE SET FIRE
TO THE PLACE AND...

57
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,367
BURNED HIMSELF TO DEATH.

58
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,270
VINNIE HERE'S
THE CORONER--
UNDERTAKER.

59
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,540
BODY WAS BURNT
PRETTY BAD.

60
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,709
EVEN IF YOU KNEW HIM

61
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,877
LIKELY YOU WOULDN'T
RECOGNIZE HIM.

62
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,146
I WILL KNOW HIM.

63
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,524
FOLLOW ME.

64
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,827
THIS IS WHERE
WE KEEP THE BODY...

65
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,796
WAITING FOR SOMEBODY
TO CLAIM HIM.

66
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,837
THERE HE IS.

67
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,739
WELL?

68
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:57,010
HIS NAME IS
HENRY RAPHAEL CAINE...

69
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,681
MY GRANDFATHER.

70
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,926
STAND UP. PLEASE.

71
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,298
YOU HAVE
YOUR FATHER IN YOU.

72
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,234
I HAVE NOTHING
TO GIVE YOU.

73
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,536
FOR YOU...

74
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:25,072
I HAVE A FATHER,
A GRANDFATHER,

75
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,609
A GREAT-GRANDFATHER
STRETCHING BACK

76
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:32,646
TO THE ROOTS OF TIME.

77
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,256
THIS WAS MY FATHER'S.

78
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:54,868
THIS WAS YOUR FATHER'S.

79
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,108
IT'S ALL I HAVE.

80
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,111
IT'S ALL I HAVE.

81
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,880
IT'S ALL I HAVE.

82
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,683
IT'S ALL I HAVE.

83
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,653
IT'S ALL I HAVE.

84
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,889
IT'S ALL I HAVE.

85
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,493
MR. CAINE?

86
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,562
MR. CAINE?

87
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,998
I'M DR. BAXTER.

88
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,203
THE SHERIFF TOLD ME
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE

89
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,872
WHO IDENTIFIED THIS MAN.

90
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,107
YES.

91
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,110
ARE YOU RELATED TO HIM?

92
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,579
HE WAS
MY GRANDFATHER...

93
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,315
HENRY RAPHAEL CAINE.

94
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,483
THE STONECUTTER.

95
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,621
OH, I KNEW HIM
MANY YEARS AGO.

96
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,289
MR. CAINE...

97
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,326
IT MAY COMFORT YOU
TO KNOW

98
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,261
THAT SMOKE
OVERCOMES A PERSON

99
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,864
QUICKLY AND MERCIFULLY.

100
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,632
I'M SURE THAT YOUR
GRANDFATHER'S DEATH

101
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:09,837
WAS LESS CRUEL
THAN IT MIGHT SEEM.

102
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:14,975
MY GRANDFATHER DID NOT
DIE OF SMOKE OR FIRE.

103
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,710
WHAT?

104
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:21,782
WHEN I WASHED HIS BODY,
I FOUND A BULLET HERE.

105
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,785
MURDERED?

106
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,421
WHY?

107
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:32,192
HENRY HASN'T LIVED IN THESE
PARTS FOR MANY YEARS.

108
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,427
THAT SHACK
WHERE THEY FOUND HIM--

109
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,297
NO ONE EVER GOES THERE.

110
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,232
OR A DRIFTER.

111
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,735
YES, THAT COULD BE.

112
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:45,072
HENRY PASSING THROUGH,
STOPPED TO REST

113
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:48,175
DRIFTER CAME UPON HIM,
WANTED HIS MONEY.

114
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,243
HE WAS NOT ROBBED.

115
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,946
HIS MONEY IS HERE.

116
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,348
SADDLEBAG.

117
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,517
BUT YOU SAY
HE WAS SHOT.

118
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,019
THERE MUST BE
SOME REASON.

119
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:02,823
I WILL DISCOVER IT WHEN
I FIND HIS MURDERER.

120
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,860
YOU SEEM VERY SURE.

121
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,863
I AM.

122
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:15,803
WHAT ARE YOU AFTER--
VENGEANCE? JUSTICE?

123
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,405
PEACE...

124
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,009
FOR HIS TROUBLED SPIRIT.

125
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,460
WHEN YOU HAVE CROSSED THE SEA

126
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:46,133
YOU WILL ABIDE FOR A TIME IN
THE CITY CALLED SAN FRANCISCO.

127
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:50,237
IN ALL THIS TIME, YOU MUST CLING
TO YOUR BLOOD OATH

128
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,407
AND THE STRENGTH OF YOUR WILL
TO VENGEANCE

129
00:12:54,474 --> 00:13:00,413
WILL REACH OUT AND TOUCH
THE SOULS OF OUR SHAME.

130
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,749
Lok: THE LOATHSOME PRESENCE
OF THE HATED SHAOLIN

131
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,684
IS STRONGLY FELT.

132
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,419
HE IS NEAR.

133
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:11,024
EVEN NOW OUR POWER GOES FORTH
TO SEEK HIM OUT.

134
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:14,094
LET US PREPARE TO MEET HIM.

135
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,466
WITHIN THIS CUP

136
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:23,170
IN THE MANNER OF THE FIRST TRIAD
OF THE SUBLIME SERVANTS

137
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,072
WE MINGLE THE BLOOD OF OUR VEINS

138
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,407
WITH THE BLOOD
OF THE AVENGING DRAGON

139
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:32,312
AND PLEDGE DESTRUCTION
OF KWAI CHANG CAINE.

140
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:38,585
SOON OUR CHALLENGE
WILL BE PRESENTED.

141
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,071
WE WILL FACE OUR ENEMY.

142
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,885
THE ANCIENT FORMS OF
THE CODE OF TAI SING LULEE

143
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,554
WILL BE HONORED.

144
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,124
HE WILL RESPOND AS HE MUST

145
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,094
AND WE WILL BE FREE
TO ACCOMPLISH OUR DESTINY.

146
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:27,968
DEATH TO THE PRIEST
KWAI CHANG CAINE.

147
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,595
HOW'D IT END, SIS?

148
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,963
VERY QUICK.

149
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,232
I TOLD YOU HE WAS
TOP ANIMAL, MISS McLEAN

150
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,701
AND HE'LL SIRE YOU A LOT
MORE JUST LIKE HIM.

151
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,470
HE LOOKS TO HAVE SOME BARB
IN HIM, MR. PERKINS.

152
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,840
WHY, HE'S A PUREBRED
FROM THE DARLEY ARABIAN.

153
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,309
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
SIS?

154
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,178
HE'S PURE ENOUGH
ARAB FOR ME.

155
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,379
LOOK.

156
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:50,150
A TRUE ARAB HAS A MORE
FINELY TAPERED HEAD...

157
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:55,522
HIS TAIL ISN'T SET LOW. THERE
MAY BE NO MORE THAN THE FACE

158
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,624
AND I DON'T DOUBT
THAT YOU COULD ARGUE.

159
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,993
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR MY LITTLE SISTER.

160
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,162
NO SALE.

161
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,240
PULL HIM OUT.

162
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,099
SARAH.

163
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,302
AH. COME IN, GEORGE.

164
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:43,903
COME IN.

165
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,406
IT'S BEEN
QUITE SOME TIME.

166
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:51,111
UH, CAN I GET YOU,
UH...SOMETHING?

167
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:58,918
OH, YOU HAVE SOMETHING
ON YOUR MIND.

168
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,420
YES, UH...

169
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,655
YES, SARAH,
I'M SORRY.

170
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,891
IT'S ABOUT HENRY.

171
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,494
HE'S DEAD.

172
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,929
HE WAS MURDERED.

173
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,465
THEY FOUND HIM
IN A CABIN.

174
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:17,504
THERE WAS A FIRE,
BUT FIRST HE WAS SHOT.

175
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,273
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

176
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,975
YOU'VE BEEN
TO LORDSVILLE?

177
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,378
NO. THAT HAPPENED HERE.

178
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,817
HE CAME BACK
TO CALIFORNIA?

179
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,919
WHY?

180
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,787
I DON'T KNOW.

181
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:38,458
FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS,
HE WAS STOPPING OVER.

182
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:42,562
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT
TRY TO CONTACT YOU.

183
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:48,968
I CLOSED THE DOOR ON HENRY CAINE
OVER 20 YEARS AGO.

184
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:54,073
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WORD
EXCHANGED BETWEEN US SINCE...

185
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,843
NOR REASON FOR ONE.

186
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,312
NOT MANY
BETWEEN US EITHER.

187
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,653
I SAW JOHNNY
AND MARGIT.

188
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,989
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN
OUR GRANDCHILDREN.

189
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,459
NO, GEORGE, NEVER.

190
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:16,463
THAT'S A DREAM
YOU HAD...ALONE.

191
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,498
I KNOW.

192
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:22,001
I KNOW BETTER NOW,
BELIEVE ME.

193
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:27,174
BUT, SARAH, I CAME HERE TO TALK
ABOUT HENRY'S DEATH.

194
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,675
YOU MUST REALIZE THE SHERIFF

195
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:32,779
WILL HAVE TO MAKE
AN INVESTIGATION.

196
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,714
THAT DOESN'T CONCERN ME.

197
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,983
IT MIGHT.

198
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,686
THERE'S A MAN
IN TOWN...

199
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,388
HENRY'S GRANDSON.

200
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:46,326
GOOD. MAYBE HE CAN GIVE
THE SHERIFF A HAND.

201
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,662
UH-UH. HE WON'T WAIT
FOR THE SHERIFF.

202
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,999
HE'LL LOOK FOR
HIS OWN ANSWERS.

203
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,002
I THOUGHT YOU
SHOULD KNOW.

204
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,271
THANK YOU, GEORGE.

205
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,441
THANK YOU
FOR COMING BY.

206
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,243
DR. BAXTER,
HOW'VE YOU BEEN?

207
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,378
-FINE, MARGIT. YOU?
-FINE.

208
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,846
ANYTHING WRONG
WITH SARAH?

209
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,281
OH, NO, NO, NO.

210
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:44,016
I JUST RODE OUT TO SPEAK
TO HER ABOUT A...

211
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,585
AN OLD FRIEND.

212
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,153
ANYBODY I KNOW?

213
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,589
HIS NAME WAS
HENRY RAPHAEL CAINE.

214
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:51,791
WAS?

215
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,760
HE'S DEAD.

216
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,528
MURDERED.

217
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,201
SARAH NEVER
MENTIONED HIM TO YOU?

218
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,938
NO.

219
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,940
I NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

220
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,844
HMM.
WELL, TAKE CARE.

221
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,717
GOOD DAY.

222
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,822
JOHNNY?

223
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,925
WHAT'S WRONG?
TELL ME.

224
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,560
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

225
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,862
HEY, I'M YOUR SISTER,
REMEMBER?

226
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,099
I CAN TELL WHEN
SOMETHING'S BOTHERING YOU.

227
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,167
WELL, YOU KNOW MORE
THAN I DO, THEN.

228
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,236
I DON'T THINK YOU WERE
TELLING THE TRUTH

229
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,938
TO DR. BAXTER
ABOUT THAT MAN.

230
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,373
SIS!

231
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,743
NO. YOU SAID YOU NEVER HEARD
OF HIM. I THINK YOU DID.

232
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,683
WHAT CAN I DO
TO CONVINCE YOU?

233
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,557
LISTEN, SIS, TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

234
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:00,460
SOON AS I FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS
THAT'S BOTHERING ME

235
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,762
UH, I PROMISE I'LL
COME RUNNING TO YOU

236
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,498
AND YOU'RE THE FIRST
PERSON I'LL TELL, OK?

237
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,933
Man: KEEP, THEN, HIS HATED IMAGE
BEFORE YOU.

238
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,436
KNOW THAT HE MAY LOOK
FOR CONCEALMENT

239
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,838
IN THE VASTNESS OF SPACES

240
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,008
FOR WITHIN THIS VASTNESS,
THERE IS A CLOSENESS

241
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,744
AND WITHIN THIS CLOSENESS

242
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,548
THERE IS ONE
WHO WILL BETRAY HIM.

243
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,371
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MISS McLEAN.

244
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:26,806
HI.

245
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,880
-DR. BAXTER?
-OH, MARGIT.

246
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:40,453
I ALWAYS SEEM TO COME
TO YOU, DON'T I?

247
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,756
WELL, I WOULDN'T WANT
THAT TO CHANGE.

248
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:54,634
WHY DID YOU COME OUT
TO THE RANCH TODAY?

249
00:23:54,701 --> 00:24:00,006
UH, WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR
GRANDMOTHER IN A LONG TIME.

250
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,109
BUT WHY TODAY?

251
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:07,747
IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT
MAN THAT WAS KILLED, DIDN'T IT?

252
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:12,752
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
HENRY RAPHAEL CAINE?

253
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,587
WHO IS HE?

254
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:19,191
UM, HE WAS AN OLD FRIEND
OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S.

255
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,427
YOU BOTH KNEW HIM?

256
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:23,029
YES.

257
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,230
TELL ME ABOUT HIM.

258
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,533
WHAT WAS HE
TO GRANDMOTHER?

259
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,501
MARGIT, UH...

260
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,703
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN ANSWER THAT.

261
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,839
YEAH, BUT SHE WON'T.

262
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,909
YOU WON'T EITHER,
WILL YOU?

263
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:37,910
LOOK, MARGIT--

264
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,780
LISTEN, DR. BAXTER,
I'M SCARED.

265
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:44,116
I'M SCARED FOR JOHNNY.

266
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,885
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

267
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,121
YES?

268
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,493
I DID NOT KNOW
YOU WERE BUSY. I AM SORRY.

269
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:58,197
MISS McLEAN
IS JUST LEAVING.

270
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,399
MARGIT McLEAN

271
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,669
KWAI CHANG CAINE.

272
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,942
CAINE?

273
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,180
I'LL SEE YOU OUT.

274
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,034
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT
ME TO DO, DOC?

275
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:40,840
WHAT? OH, NO, NO.
JUST GO ON SWEEPING.

276
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,109
YOU'RE DOING
A GOOD JOB.

277
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:59,091
Man: YOU ARE THE NEW
STUDENT. COME CLOSER.

278
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,266
YOU CANNOT SEE.

279
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,802
YOU THINK
I CANNOT SEE?

280
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,504
OF ALL THINGS

281
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,474
TO LIVE IN DARKNESS
MUST BE THE WORST.

282
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:19,411
FEAR IS
THE ONLY DARKNESS.

283
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:22,014
TAKE YOUR BROOM AND
STRIKE ME WITH IT.

284
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:26,819
DO AS I TELL YOU.
STRIKE.

285
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,659
AGAIN.

286
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,632
HERE. CATCH.

287
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,803
HA HA HA!

288
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,706
NEVER ASSUME THAT
BECAUSE A MAN HAS NO EYES

289
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,141
HE CANNOT SEE.

290
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,811
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

291
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:55,081
WHAT DO YOU HEAR?

292
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:58,117
I HEAR THE WATER

293
00:26:58,184 --> 00:26:59,986
I HEAR THE BIRDS.

294
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,755
DO YOU HEAR
YOUR OWN HEARTBEAT?

295
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,892
NO.

296
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,794
DO YOU HEAR
THE GRASSHOPPER

297
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,797
WHICH IS AT YOUR FEET?

298
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:14,767
OLD MAN, HOW IS IT THAT
YOU HEAR THESE THINGS?

299
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:18,938
YOUNG MAN, HOW IS IT
THAT YOU DO NOT?

300
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,411
I'M SORRY TO KEEP
YOU WAITING.

301
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,647
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

302
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:30,482
I FOUND THIS
IN THE FIRE--

303
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,618
A BOOK OF THE BIBLE.

304
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,353
INSIDE,
AN INSCRIPTION...

305
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,555
IN A WOMAN'S HAND...

306
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,925
IN MEMORIAM.

307
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:42,762
IS IT NOT STRANGE
THAT THIS WOULD BE SENT

308
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:46,766
IN MEMORY OF MY GRANDFATHER
BEFORE HIS DEATH?

309
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,502
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT WAS SENT TO HIM?

310
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,571
SUPPOSE HE PICKED IT UP
SOMEWHERE?

311
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,841
THERE IS A PASSAGE
MARKED.

312
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:02,448
"AND WHEN HE HAD OPENED
THE FOURTH SEAL

313
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,853
"I HEARD THE VOICE OF THE FOURTH
BEAST SAY COME AND SEE

314
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,758
"AND I LOOKED, AND BEHOLD
A PALE HORSE...

315
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,626
AND HIS NAME THAT SAT
ON HIM WAS DEATH."

316
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,828
A THREAT.

317
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,797
A WARNING.

318
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,932
A PREDICTION.

319
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:25,137
OR PERHAPS, AS IT SAYS,
A REVELATION FROM THE LORD.

320
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:30,376
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
IT WAS MEANT FOR HIM.

321
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,344
BUT I BELIEVE
THAT IT WAS.

322
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,646
MR. CAINE, YOU'VE BURIED
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

323
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,148
LET HIM REST IN PEACE.

324
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:40,019
A MURDERED MAN CANNOT REST
IN PEACE, NOR CAN I.

325
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:44,390
IT IS MY DUTY TO REMAIN
UNTIL THE TRUTH IS KNOWN

326
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,626
ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER'S
DEATH.

327
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:51,730
AND WHERE DO YOU EXPECT
TO FIND THE TRUTH?

328
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:54,433
WHO WAS THAT WOMAN
WHO WAS HERE?

329
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:59,171
MARGIT McLEAN.

330
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,572
WHY?

331
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:04,310
DO YOU KNOW WHY MY GRANDFATHER
CAME TO THIS TOWN?

332
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,214
NO.

333
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,750
NO, I DON'T.

334
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,193
THANK YOU.

335
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,988
WHAT WAS SO FUNNY?

336
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:50,756
WELL, ASK YOUR BROTHER.

337
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:53,259
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PERFECTLY
INNOCENT REMARK.

338
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,194
INNOCENT? SARAH!

339
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,663
NOW, I'M REALLY GOING TO
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

340
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,166
ABOUT YOUR MANNERS, JOHNNY.

341
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:03,169
WAS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANTED, DEAR?

342
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:06,238
WHO WAS
HENRY RAPHAEL CAINE?

343
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,241
WHY DO YOU ASK?

344
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,846
DO I ALWAYS GET EVASIONS
INSTEAD OF ANSWERS?

345
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:18,817
WELL, SUPPOSE I TOLD YOU
I NEVER HEARD THE NAME?

346
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:22,288
WELL, YOU BOTH OBVIOUSLY
KNOW WHO HE WAS.

347
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,323
HE WAS...

348
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,125
A NOBODY.

349
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:29,195
COME ON, MARGIT.
WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT?

350
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:33,900
SHE'S BEEN TALKING
TO GEORGE BAXTER.

351
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:36,102
YES, I HAVE.

352
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,537
YOU KNOW, GEORGE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN BORN A WOMAN.

353
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:41,740
HE ENJOYS GOSSIP SO MUCH.

354
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,843
WHAT'S ALL THIS INTEREST
IN HENRY CAINE?

355
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:47,113
WHEN I WAS LEAVING
DR. BAXTER'S OFFICE

356
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,316
-I MET HIS GRANDSON.
-OH.

357
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:54,887
YES. HE WAS CARRYING A BOOK
WITH A RED BINDING

358
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:58,457
SORT OF LIKE THE ONES
IN YOUR SET, SARAH.

359
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,261
HOW DID HE GET IT?

360
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,230
I SHOULD THINK
YOU'D HAVE ASKED HIM.

361
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:08,267
JOHNNY, WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO DO WITH ALL OF THIS?

362
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:10,836
WITH WHAT?

363
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:13,572
WITH WHAT! JOHNNY!

364
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,142
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
SO UPSET ABOUT, MARGIT?

365
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,876
THERE IS SOMETHING
GOING ON HERE

366
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:19,845
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

367
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,513
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT...

368
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,650
AND I AM SCARED FOR YOU.

369
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,954
COME ON, SIS.

370
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,323
THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING ON
AROUND IS IN YOUR IMAGINATION.

371
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,159
MY IMAGINATION.

372
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,661
LOOK, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER,
BUT RIGHT NOW

373
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,698
I HAVE A FEW THINGS THAT I GOTTA
GO OVER WITH SARAH, OK?

374
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,567
COME ON.

375
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,937
MARGIT?

376
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,706
THIS CAINE,
THE GRANDSON

377
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,475
WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?

378
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,377
HE'S CHINESE.

379
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,545
CHINESE?

380
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,215
HALF CHINESE.

381
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,650
I MIGHT HAVE
EXPECTED IT.

382
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,663
SHE'S NOT GOING
TO LET IT GO.

383
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,303
AND WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T?

384
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,206
YOU GOING TO LET
A CHINABOY WORRY US?

385
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,942
IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO HAVE A LOOK AT HIM.

386
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,545
IF YOU SAY SO.

387
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,181
JOHNNY?

388
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:34,453
DID I EVER TELL YOU
HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU?

389
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,866
I WAS JUST IN THE POST OFFICE
GETTING YOUR--

390
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,336
RICHIE, IF YOU WANT
TO BECOME A DOCTOR

391
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,139
YOU'VE GOT TO START WORKING
ON YOUR BEDSIDE MANNER.

392
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,906
-SORRY. HERE.
-THANK YOU.

393
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,343
YOU KNOW THAT MAN WHO
WAS IN HERE YESTERDAY?

394
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,744
CAINE?

395
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,546
I THOUGHT
HE LOOKED FAMILIAR.

396
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:03,682
YOU KNOW HOW I LIKE TO LOOK
THROUGH THE WANTED POSTERS?

397
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,354
THAT'S HIM.

398
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,356
WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO DO?

399
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,495
I'M A DOCTOR,
NOT A LAWMAN.

400
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,999
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

401
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:41,487
I SAW YOU WORKING IN FRONT
OF THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

402
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,956
IS IT NOT GOOD
TO SWEEP

403
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,992
KEEP THINGS CLEAN?

404
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,728
I ONLY DO THAT
BECAUSE I HAVE TO.

405
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:53,932
MY REAL AMBITION IS
TO BE A DOCTOR SOMEDAY.

406
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:55,367
YOU HAVE LEARNED DISCIPLINE

407
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:58,604
AND ACQUIRED MANY
NEW ABILITIES.

408
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:04,443
HOWEVER, NEVER FORGET THAT
A PRIEST'S LIFE IS A SIMPLE ONE

409
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,380
AND MUST REMAIN
FREE OF AMBITION.

410
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,553
HAVE YOU NO AMBITION,
MASTER PO?

411
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,757
ONLY ONE.

412
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:21,660
5 YEARS HENCE,
IT IS MY WISH

413
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,796
TO MAKE A PILGRIMAGE
TO THE FORBIDDEN CITY.

414
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:30,336
IT IS A PLACE WHERE EVEN PRIESTS
RECEIVE NO SPECIAL STATUS.

415
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,540
THERE, IN THE TEMPLE
OF HEAVEN

416
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:40,379
WILL BE A FESTIVAL
THE FULL MOON OF MAY.

417
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:44,350
IT WLL BE THE 13th DAY
OF THE FIFTH MONTH

418
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,153
OF THE YEAR OF THE DOG.

419
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,126
THAT IS NOT SUCH
A GREAT AMBITION.

420
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:59,265
BUT IT IS AMBITION
NONETHELESS.

421
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:03,335
WHO AMONG US
IS WITHOUT FLAW?

422
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,672
CAINE?

423
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,150
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.

424
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:25,491
UM, DR. BAXTER TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR GRANDFATHER...

425
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:31,430
THAT HE WAS DEAD.

426
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,201
I'M SORRY.

427
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:43,775
MISS McLEAN?

428
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,546
DID YOU KNOW
MY GRANDFATHER?

429
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:50,649
NO.

430
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,020
BUT YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM.

431
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,488
NO.

432
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:58,757
WHY DID YOU COME
TO SEE ME?

433
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:03,295
WELL, YESTERDAY
YOU HAD A BOOK

434
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:05,764
THE SCRIPTURE, I THINK

435
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,599
WITH A RED BINDING.

436
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,535
YES.

437
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,104
I'D LIKE TO BUY IT
FROM YOU.

438
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,807
WHY?

439
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,876
NO SPECIAL REASON.

440
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:20,279
I'D JUST LIKE
TO HAVE IT.

441
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,549
I DO NOT WISH
TO SELL IT.

442
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,354
ALRIGHT.

443
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:33,392
THE BOOK WAS SENT TO MY
GRANDFATHER BEFORE HE DIED.

444
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:36,161
THERE WAS A PASSAGE
UNDERLINED.

445
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:40,198
INSIDE THE FRONT PAGE,
THERE WERE WORDS.

446
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,604
WHOEVER WROTE THEM KNEW MY
GRANDFATHER WOULD BE KILLED.

447
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,116
Johnny:
CHINABOY.

448
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,785
Margit: JOHNNY.

449
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,325
YOU THINK IT'S YOUR PLACE
TO TALK TO MY SISTER?

450
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,762
I DO NOT WISH
TO OFFEND.

451
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:17,135
WELL, THEN, COOL OUT MY HORSE
AND CURRY HIM FOR ME...

452
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:18,937
NOW.

453
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:22,007
I AM SORRY.
I CANNOT.

454
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,443
YOU'RE A STABLE BOY,
AREN'T YOU?

455
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,378
I HAVE BEEN GIVEN
OTHER WORK.

456
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:29,915
I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.

457
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,249
JOHNNY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

458
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:32,851
I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING, SIS.

459
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:36,755
I JUST WANT THIS STABLE BOY
TO TAKE CARE OF MY HORSE.

460
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:38,023
HE'S NOT A STABLE BOY.

461
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,792
-THIS IS CAINE, THE MAN--
-I DON'T CARE!

462
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:45,263
HE'LL DO WHAT I TELL HIM TO DO
AND HE WILL, AREN'T YOU, BOY?

463
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:51,136
DO I HAVE TO USE
A LITTLE PERSUASION?

464
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,739
I HAVE NO WISH
TO FIGHT WITH YOU.

465
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,944
WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU HAVE ANY CHOICE.

466
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:10,356
Caine: AH! AAH!

467
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,429
UNH!

468
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,534
Margit: JOHNNY!

469
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:25,203
UNH!

470
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:29,074
OH. LET ME SEE.

471
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,876
LEAVE ME ALONE.

472
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,145
THIS DON'T END IT, BOY.

473
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:35,347
I AM SORRY.

474
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:37,349
BETTER GET YOU
TO THE DOCTOR.

475
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,351
YOU GONNA
SEE ME AGAIN.

476
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:42,488
THIS AIN'T THE LAST
AND YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT!

477
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:59,137
DOC, UH,
I'VE GOT A SCRATCH.

478
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:02,007
UH-HUH.

479
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,777
WELL, LET ME
HAVE A LOOK.

480
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,413
OH.

481
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:10,181
UH-HUH. GET ME
SOME SCISSORS

482
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,750
WILL YOU PLEASE,
THERE, MARGIT?

483
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:13,084
HERE. SIT DOWN.

484
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,489
FIX YOU UP
IN A MINUTE.

485
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:32,904
HOW'D THIS HAPPEN?

486
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:37,275
SOME CHINABOY DOWN AT
THE STABLE GOT ORNERY.

487
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:42,948
UH-HUH. AND THEN YOU GOT ORNERY
RIGHT ALONG WITH HIM, HUH?

488
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:46,251
YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME TO BACK OFF
FROM A CHINABOY, WOULD YOU?

489
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,786
HIS NAME IS CAINE.

490
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,723
WHAT WAS
THE FIGHT ABOUT?

491
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,793
IT WAS NOTHING. IT WAS JUST KIDS
PLAYING IN THE BARN.

492
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,162
MM-MMM.

493
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,230
YOU THINK HE'S
REALLY PLAYING?

494
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:01,600
GRANDFATHER'S
BEEN MURDERED.

495
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,136
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS TO YOU

496
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,038
BUT HE'S NOT GOING
TO FORGET IT.

497
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,274
YOU SAW
WHAT HE'S LIKE.

498
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,742
HE'S GOING TO STAY WITH THIS

499
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:14,112
TILL HE FINDS
THE MAN WHO DID IT.

500
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,048
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

501
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,627
Man: YOU ALRIGHT,
JOHNNY?

502
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,901
I'D LIKE TO SEND A WIRE.

503
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,970
AND THE MESSAGE,
MISS McLEAN?

504
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:15,941
UH, THE CHINESE LIGATION
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

505
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:19,911
THE MAN YOU WANT FOR MURDER
IS HERE IN GURNEYVILLE.

506
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,247
HOW DO YOU WANT
TO SIGN IT?

507
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,884
NO SIGNATURE.

508
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:28,219
THE LAW REQUIRES IT,
MISS McLEAN.

509
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,123
ANY NAME WILL DO.

510
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,128
JUDAS.

511
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:50,041
Man: HEAR US, PRIEST.
THE MOMENT OF MEETING

512
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,810
WRITTEN IN BLOOD

513
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:56,281
FROM THE BEGINNINGS OF TIME
IS HERE

514
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:02,053
ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT CODES
OF SACRED HONOR.

515
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,255
WE BID YOU HERE

516
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:08,727
AND WE BID YOU COME.

517
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,865
Master Kan: YOU MUST PREPARE
YOURSELF FOR WHAT LIES AHEAD

518
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:16,835
IN YOUR CHOSEN ROLE
AS PRIEST.

519
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:20,872
THE NATURE OF WIND
AND FIRE AND ICE

520
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:24,475
THE FRAILTY OF THE HUMAN
CONDITION IN HUNGER AND THIRST

521
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,511
AND FATIGUE

522
00:42:26,578 --> 00:42:29,380
THE PREDATORY INSTINCTS
OF LIVING THINGS

523
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:34,085
THE GREED AND FINALITY BURIED
IN THE HEARTS OF MEN.

524
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:37,923
YOU MUST BE PREPARED TO SURVIVE
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

525
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:41,026
THESE GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS
YOU NOW PERFORM

526
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,929
BELONG WITH THE RIGORS
OF ALL THOSE DISCIPLINES

527
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,865
WHICH YOUR MASTERS
IMPOSE UPON YOU

528
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:49,701
WILL HELP YOU TO DEVELOP
THE INNER STRENGTH--

529
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:51,670
THAT WHICH WE CALL CHI--

530
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,405
AND WHEN YOU COME TO MEET
YOUR GREATEST TEST

531
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,341
YOUR HIGHEST CHALLENGES

532
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:00,946
WHEN YOU CALL UPON YOUR CHI,
IT WILL NOT DESERT YOU.

533
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:17,062
COME ON.
HE'S WAITING ON YOU.

534
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:25,003
YOU WISH TO SEE ME?

535
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:29,374
MR. CAINE, UH, SOMETHING'S BEEN
TAKEN FROM THIS OFFICE HERE

536
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,109
THAT CONCERNS YOU...

537
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:33,344
A POSTER.

538
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:35,513
YOU KNOW THE ONE
I'M SPEAKING OF?

539
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,982
YES.

540
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,719
IT WAS REMOVED WITHOUT MY
KNOWLEDGE OR MY PERMISSION

541
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:42,988
BY MARGIT McLEAN.

542
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,958
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT
UNTIL SHE'D GONE.

543
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,697
YOU DON'T SEEM
VERY ALARMED.

544
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:55,500
THERE IS NOTHING
TO BE DONE.

545
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,003
MARGIT MAY NOTIFY
THE AUTHORITIES.

546
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,505
I BELIEVE SHE HAS
ALREADY DONE SO.

547
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:03,241
THEY'LL COME HERE
LOOKING FOR YOU.

548
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,476
YES.

549
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:08,113
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO LET THEM COME?

550
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,248
I...STAND.

551
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,785
OH!

552
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:17,155
YOU'RE AS STUBBORN
AS HE WAS!

553
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:19,190
MY GRANDFATHER?

554
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,829
YEAH.

555
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,767
WE WERE FRIENDS
40 YEARS AGO...

556
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:34,505
TILL WE FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE SAME GIRL...

557
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,607
SARAH KINGSLEY.

558
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,944
IS SHE STILL ALIVE?

559
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,779
YES.

560
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:43,414
I TALKED WITH HER
THIS MORNING.

561
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:45,851
THE INSCRIPTION
ON THE BIBLE

562
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,353
WAS IN THE HAND
OF A WOMAN.

563
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:53,759
YOU STILL LOVE THIS
WOMAN, DO YOU NOT?

564
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:00,799
I'LL ASK YOU
NOTHING ELSE.

565
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:03,534
UH, NO.
MR. CAINE?

566
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:07,672
YOU'VE ALREADY MET
MARGIT'S BROTHER...

567
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,607
IN THE LIVERY STABLE.

568
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:11,309
JOHNNY?

569
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,914
WHATEVER HE MIGHT
HAVE DONE

570
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:18,449
IT WAS SARAH
THAT MADE IT HAPPEN.

571
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:25,490
ONE MORE THING I THINK
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

572
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,227
YOUR GRANDFATHER
HENRY CAINE

573
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:30,862
AND SARAH...

574
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:35,066
THEY HAD A DAUGHTER.

575
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:37,936
JOHNNY AND MARGIT
ARE HER CHILDREN.

576
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:43,942
YOU, JOHNNY,
AND MARGIT...

577
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:46,011
ARE THE SAME BLOOD.

578
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,229
WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR BEYOND
THE SEA, GRASSHOPPER?

579
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:06,865
THAT PART OF ME WHICH
I KNOW LITTLE OF--

580
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:09,234
THE PAST OUT OF WHICH
I WAS BORN.

581
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,837
THEN SOMEDAY
YOU MUST SEEK IT.

582
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:16,808
BUT IS IT GOOD TO SEEK
THE PAST, MASTER PO?

583
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,877
DOES IT NOT ROB
THE PRESENT?

584
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:20,879
IF A MAN DWELLS
ON THE PAST

585
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:22,814
THEN HE ROBS THE PRESENT.

586
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:25,483
BUT IF A MAN
IGNORES THE PAST

587
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,652
HE MAY ROB THE FUTURE.

588
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,421
THE SEEDS OF OUR DESTINY
ARE NURTURED

589
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,523
BY THE ROOTS OF OUR PAST.

590
00:46:57,082 --> 00:46:59,885
IT WILL DULL THE PAIN.

591
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,656
IT'S ALREADY FORGOTTEN.

592
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:06,858
OF COURSE.

593
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:09,427
I'D EXPECT THAT.

594
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,097
THERE'S ANOTHER WOUND...

595
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,831
DEEPER.

596
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,869
WELL, YOU TOLD ME
TO HAVE A LOOK AT HIM.

597
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:20,571
YES. EXACTLY.

598
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:24,009
HAD YOU DONE WHAT I ASKED,
YOU WOULDN'T NEED THAT.

599
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:29,347
YOU LOWERED YOURSELF,
JOHNNY...

600
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:32,350
GOT DOWN ON HIS LEVEL

601
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:35,286
TRUSSLED LIKE
A COMMON RUFFIAN.

602
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,722
HE DOESN'T FIGHT
LIKE A MAN.

603
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,725
DID YOU THINK HE WOULD?

604
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,994
PEOPLE LIKE THAT
HAVE NO SENSE OF FORM.

605
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:46,597
THEY MAKE THEIR OWN
RULES LIKE ANIMALS.

606
00:47:48,766 --> 00:47:51,069
SARAH...

607
00:47:51,136 --> 00:47:54,172
WHY CAN'T WE
BE DONE WITH IT?

608
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,341
I MEAN...

609
00:47:57,642 --> 00:48:01,312
-I THOUGHT IT WAS FINISHED.
-IT WILL BE.

610
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,813
HE'S STUBBORN.

611
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,417
DOCTOR SAYS HE THINKS HE'S GOING
TO KEEP POKING HIS NOSE IN.

612
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:09,554
WE MAY HAVE TO DEAL
WITH HIM, THEN.

613
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,359
SARAH...

614
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,462
DON'T PUSH ME TO THAT.

615
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:18,964
I'M NOT.

616
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,033
I'M ONLY WORRIED
FOR YOU.

617
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,302
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF
YEARS TO LIVE, JOHNNY.

618
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:28,373
YOU WANT TO BE FREE TO
LIVE THEM GRACEFULLY...

619
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:30,008
LIKE A KINGSLEY.

620
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:33,144
HE'S NOT A KINGSLEY.

621
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:35,913
HE'S A McLEAN, SARAH.

622
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:37,148
MARGIT...

623
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:41,987
SUPPOSE YOU LEAVE THIS
TO JOHNNY AND ME?

624
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:44,722
DON'T YOU THINK
I BELONG IN THIS?

625
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,891
HE'S MY BROTHER.

626
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,593
OH, MARGIT.

627
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,363
LISTEN, IT'S AS IF I NEVER
WAS A PART OF THIS FAMILY

628
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,698
AS IF YOU 2--

629
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:59,004
IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY,
WHATEVER IS HOLDING YOU HERE?

630
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:08,113
SARAH, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

631
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,181
WE CAN'T WORRY ABOUT
HER NOW, JOHNNY.

632
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:12,083
I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU.

633
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,385
THIS CHINAMAN
NOSING AROUND

634
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,854
IT'S NOT GOOD.

635
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:19,690
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
SOMETHING?

636
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:21,792
YES. IN THE FUTURE

637
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:25,530
REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE.

638
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:28,299
DO THE RIGHT THING.

639
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:31,336
SARAH...

640
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:36,341
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE RIGHT THING IS.

641
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:37,908
HEH.

642
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:43,014
THERE IS A RIGHT
AND THERE IS A WRONG.

643
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:44,315
WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN IT

644
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:48,153
AND WE'VE ALWAYS ACTED
ON THAT PRINCIPLE.

645
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:49,987
YOU WILL DO IT

646
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:53,191
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
HELP YOURSELF.

647
00:49:53,258 --> 00:49:55,760
I'M SURE OF IT, JOHNNY.

648
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:47,445
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU...

649
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:49,046
SOMETHING I DID.

650
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:52,049
I KNOW. THE POSTER.

651
00:50:52,117 --> 00:50:54,352
YOU SENT A TELEGRAM.

652
00:50:55,953 --> 00:50:59,790
YOU KNOW AND
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

653
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:02,327
YOU MUST HATE ME.

654
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,362
I DO NOT HATE YOU.

655
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:09,434
BUT I BETRAYED YOU.

656
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,170
NOT FROM ILL WILL
TO ME...

657
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:14,439
BUT LOVE FOR
YOUR BROTHER.

658
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:17,575
YOU FEARED THAT
I WOULD HURT HIM.

659
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:23,614
I DON'T FEAR THAT ANYMORE.

660
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:28,219
I DON'T FEEL THAT YOU'D
HURT ANYONE DELIBERATELY.

661
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:31,622
AND I DON'T--I DON'T BELIEVE
WHAT THE POSTER SAID.

662
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:36,761
WHY DID THEY OFFER MORE
FOR YOU ALIVE THAN DEAD?

663
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:42,433
THE CODE OF
TAI SING LULEE.

664
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,103
IF I AM ALIVE, THEN
THEY MAY KILL ME

665
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:49,207
IN THEIR OWN
SPECIAL WAY.

666
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:52,510
BUT YOU--YOU CAN RUN NOW.

667
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:55,813
AS THEY ARE
HONOR BOUND TO COME

668
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,184
I AM HONOR BOUND
TO STAY.

669
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:09,994
HONOR WILL BE SERVED, PRIEST.

670
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,498
THE TIME OF OUR MEETING

671
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,166
IS AT HAND.

672
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:17,302
WE AWAIT.

673
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,109
KWAI CHANG CAINE...

674
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:26,377
WE HAVE COME FOR YOU.

675
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:28,979
THE IMPERIAL GUARDS
OF THE DRAGON THRONE..

676
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:30,648
AT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD...

677
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:33,351
WHO FAILED IN THEIR DUTY
TO PROTECT THE PERSON

678
00:52:33,418 --> 00:52:36,621
OF THE EMPEROR'S
FAVORED NEPHEW.

679
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:38,256
WHEN YOU KILLED HIM,

680
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:41,226
THE STENCH OF DISHONOR
DESCENDED ON OUR ORDER
