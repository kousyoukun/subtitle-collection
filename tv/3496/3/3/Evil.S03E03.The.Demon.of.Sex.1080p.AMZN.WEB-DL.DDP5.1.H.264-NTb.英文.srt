9
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,320
And you may now kiss the bride a second time.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,570
Why not?

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,380
You want to go for a third?

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,260
Hail, Guardian of the Redeemer.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,180
To you...

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,670
Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,630
To you...

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,140
To... to you...

17
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,000
Your mom just wanted us to chat, that's all.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,730
See how you're doing.

19
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
Uh, we're fine.

20
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,400
I-I don't know what she wants from us.

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,480
I do.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,360
Grandchildren.

23
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,030
Getting a lot of pressure for kids?

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,490
Define "A lot."

25
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,330
It's my mom. She's a bit high-maintenance.

26
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,530
Well, you, you have to set your boundaries.

27
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,490
You know, it's your home.

28
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,020
Hello?

29
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,540
Sister Andrea?

30
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,470
Can I help you?

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,600
I'm sorry, Father.

32
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,550
I left something in here.

33
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,210
Please excuse me.

34
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,270
Oh, hello.

35
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,600
I know you two, don't I?

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,870
Yes, Sister Andrea. I'm Leo.

37
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,810
That's right. High school calculus.

38
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,440
You were terrible.

39
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,020
Guess what I'm doing now.

40
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,790
- Teaching calculus? - No, I-I'm a sound recordist.

41
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,730
But once I did have to use calculus.

42
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,280
Well, I'm very proud of you.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,420
I'm Amalia.

44
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,310
Uh, Sister, remember the one

45
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,530
that kept smoking in the bathroom?

46
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,910
- Sister? -Yes. Yes, Amalia, yes.

47
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,220
Are you okay?

48
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,280
David, could I see you for a second?

49
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,160
- Now? - Yes.

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,510
I hope you're not holding my smoking against me, Sister.

51
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,700
I don't smoke anymore.

52
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,380
No, no, Amalia.

53
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,840
It's just a spiritual matter.

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,300
We'll be right back.

55
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,680
- There's a demon in there. - There's...?

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,780
- What does that mean? - It means

57
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,230
there's a demon in there between them.

58
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,390
It has its hands on their shoulders.

59
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,180
- I didn't see anything. - Because you're not as good.

60
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,150
Look at your feet.

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,370
What do you see?

62
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,240
My feet.

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,440
No. There's a trail of slime here.

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,920
- Like a snail. - Are you sure?

65
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,640
Don't patronize me.

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,530
What do you want me to do?

67
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,280
I want you to find out what the issue is.

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,460
There's something possessed in their marriage.

69
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,680
They've only been married a week.

70
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,450
It doesn't matter if it's an hour.

71
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,050
Find out what the issue is.

72
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,290
- And if there's nothing? - Then I'm wrong, Father.

73
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,200
And I should just clean up your room.

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,110
Hi. Uh, Sister Andrea's here to take notes.

75
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,800
Uh, she's a valuable consultant on, uh...

76
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,330
marital issues.

77
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,700
I don't think we really have any marital issues.

78
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,340
- We were just joking about our in-laws. - Yeah.

79
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,220
Is it an intimacy issue?

80
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,380
Fuck you.

81
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,410
If, uh, if you don't feel comfortable...

82
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,040
No, uh, it's not that.

83
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,030
You know that we saved ourselves for marriage, Father.

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,150
Well, now...

85
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,760
now that we're married,

86
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,730
we're having... sexual issues.

87
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,190
Do you feel comfortable talking about it?

88
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,160
- Or I could recommend a mental health professional. - No.

89
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,660
We don't want that.

90
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,620
Whenever we try to be intimate...

91
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,900
We have a physical reaction.

92
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,780
- Like we're... - We're allergic to each other.

93
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,610
Uh, I break out, and I...

94
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,520
- My stomach. I-It's ridiculous. - Okay.

95
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,020
This is sounding more like a medical condition,

96
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,510
not a spiritual one.

97
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,530
We have an assessor I could get a reference from.

98
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,490
Actually, father, I think it's better

99
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,270
if the Church do a thorough assessment before

100
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,240
recommending a doctor.

101
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,620
Sister, I-I disagree.

102
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,230
I-I think this is sounding more like a medical condition.

103
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,420
No. Leo, Amalia,

104
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,630
this allergic reaction that you have,

105
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,590
do you have any premonition of something dark?

106
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,930
- What do you mean? - Yeah. What do you mean, bitch?

107
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,190
Do you have a sense in your marriage of something demonic?

108
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,450
Sister, perhaps we should talk about this later.

109
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,560
Leo. Amalia.

110
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,560
Show them.

111
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,820
Uh, that's why my mom wanted us to see you, Father.

112
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,100
She said that you deal with issues like these.

113
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,310
Issues like...?

114
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,560
This is what happened last time in bed.

115
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,430
Food allergy. I didn't do that.

116
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,550
I could feel fingernails clawing into me.

117
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,930
We had to stop.

118
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,620
- You don't have a pet? - No.

119
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,920
And I didn't do it. It just suddenly appeared.

120
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,550
Help us, Father. We... don't know what's going on.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,060
Is that even possible, that a marriage can be possessed?

124
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,220
Well, officially, it's diabolical oppression,

125
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,650
which is why we need you.

126
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,490
It might just be a psychological reaction to a new marriage.

127
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,070
Right, so I'd be there to see if it's just marital dysfunction?

128
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,710
Yes. They were virgins when they got married.

129
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,630
- Really? - So there could be

130
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,860
a therapeutic answer for their physical reactions.

131
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,820
What are their physical reactions?

132
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,000
- One second. - Hives. And nausea.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,580
Well, that sounds to be expected, right?

134
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,650
Just one thing.

135
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,450
The hives are in the form of claw marks.

136
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,520
Okay. Um, tomorrow?

137
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,680
See you then.

138
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,300
So, um, the door to the master bedroom

139
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:44,990
would be right there?

140
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,270
And the master bathroom would be adjoining.

141
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,470
And how long is all this gonna take?

142
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,950
Two or three months.

143
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,080
Okay, well, let me look at these overnight.

144
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,890
I do need an answer. I have other jobs.

145
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,300
And you will have an answer tomorrow.

146
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,980
I also do plumbing. You want me to take a look upstairs?

147
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,450
No, I've got someone.

148
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,260
You're making it unhappy.

149
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,330
Yeah, well, you're making me unhappy.

150
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,580
What did you guys put down here?

151
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,620
- A kid from school. - Yeah, but a short one.

152
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,450
What is that?

153
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,110
- It's a snake. - What does it do?

154
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,490
Don't you guys have homework to do or something?

155
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,580
Have you noticed you're not very magnificent lately?

156
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,920
Yeah, you used to think we were funny.

157
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,540
Yeah, well, you used to be funny.

158
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,550
Your shoes don't match.

159
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,350
Ben the Magnificent, you are falling apart.

160
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,310
Yeah, okay. You know what? I need to do this on my own.

161
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,640
Could you guys go away?

162
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,360
- How did that happen? - I think it was an alligator.

163
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,430
I told you it's haunted.

164
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,500
Okay, would you just shut up, please?

165
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,920
We are not supposed to say that.

166
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,200
What, "Please"?

167
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,170
No.

168
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,590
I think that's why you're sad.

169
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,550
What?

170
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,150
You can't figure it out anymore.

171
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,850
Things have gotten weird. And you don't like it.

172
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,650
- Where'd you get all that? - From my psychology class.

173
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,550
It's called cultural derealization.

174
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,230
It's when you become depressed by how weird the world is.

175
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,850
Oh, my God. Are you hurt?

176
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,020
What is happening? I think you should...

177
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,040
This is getting dangerous.

178
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,650
I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm bad.

179
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm bad. I'm bad.

180
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,290
I'm bad. I'm bad.

181
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,350
I'm bad. I'm bad.

182
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,120
I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm bad.

183
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,150
I'm bad. I'm bad.

184
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,420
I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm bad.

185
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,290
I'm bad. I'm bad.

186
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,550
I'm bad. I'm bad.

187
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,040
- Lexis? - I 'm bad...

188
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,680
Hey, Mom.

189
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,870
- What were you doing? - Nothing.

190
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,630
No, you were chanting.

191
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,530
- Was it from Leland? - No, Mom, no.

192
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,380
And you got this out of my closet?

193
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,940
Lexis.

194
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,910
I told you about Leland. He's attacking this family.

195
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,500
No, this isn't about Leland, Mom.

196
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,050
- It's about Lynn. - What?

197
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,340
I told you that Lynn was dating Ren,

198
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,750
and I... look, I wasn't supposed to.

199
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,360
Wait, so Lynn made you wear this?

200
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,980
Yeah, but it was me. I wasn't supposed to tell you.

201
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,230
- What, the truth? - Yeah, but it's okay, Mom.

202
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,730
I don't mind-- Mom!

203
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,460
Family meeting, downstairs, right now.

204
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,550
What did you do?

205
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,810
- No, you did something. - This is all your fault.

206
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,540
You ate all the cookies last night.

207
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,310
No, girls. Everyone just sit on the couch,

208
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,670
- normally for once. - Can I sit on the floor?

209
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,150
- Normal sitting. - My young body

210
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,300
- cannot fit on this couch. - Okay.

211
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,840
Remember when I told you I was gonna treat you like

212
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,560
- more mature girls? - Uh-huh.

213
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,520
So that's what we're dealing with right now.

214
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,710
What's this about?

215
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,680
That's from your closet.

216
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,610
- I didn't take it. - Why was Lexis wearing it while chanting?

217
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,690
What did you say to her?

218
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,400
No, this is not about Lexis,

219
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,850
this is about us as a family.

220
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,660
Okay? Lynn, you're the oldest.

221
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,000
You're supposed to be setting an example.

222
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,120
Why are you punishing Lexis?

223
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,290
- I'm not punishing her. Hold on. - Yes, you are.

224
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,110
You told us, Mom, to support each other.

225
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,720
Family is more important than anything.

226
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,710
- Yeah, you said that... - And what Lexis did

227
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,360
hurt one of us. Me.

228
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,940
No, Lexis told the truth. She made you tell the truth.

229
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,120
But she did it because she wanted to hurt me.

230
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,140
I'm feeling a little attacked here...

231
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,320
Okay, quiet!

232
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,970
This is what we're gonna do.

233
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,170
Everybody be quiet until I talk.

234
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,930
- What's she gonna do, hit us? - It's not even my fault.

235
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,080
- Like, Lexis told. - I didn't do anything wrong.

236
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,530
- Yeah, it's Lexis's fault. - Guys, can we just please be quiet?

237
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,280
I don't want to hear this.

238
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,810
- You said, you said... - Shut up!

239
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,940
- Quiet! - ...her fault!

240
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,450
I'm creating a Ten Commandments for this family.

241
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,960
- What? - Ten rules that must be followed, no matter what.

242
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,020
But the nuns say we have ten commandments already.

243
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,200
Yeah, but my girls aren't following them.

244
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,660
So this is the first one.

245
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:23,050
Thou shalt not ever lie to Mom.

246
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,550
Do we all understand that?

247
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,770
- Yes. - Yes. What?

248
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,500
Is it all right to lie to other people?

249
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,490
No.

250
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,030
What if we have Jews in our basement?

251
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,210
- Oh, my God. - Or Trump with immigrants.

252
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:38,780
- Yeah. - Okay, look,

253
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,930
as real as these examples are,

254
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,060
we're just gonna have to figure it out as we go.

255
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,290
Okay? But what's most important?

256
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,480
"Thou shalt not ever lie to Mom."

257
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,210
Very good. All right, number two.

258
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,590
"If Leland approaches you,

259
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,380
- tell Mom." - Beautiful.

260
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,760
Number three.

261
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,140
"Do not go into Mom's closet."

262
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,430
There are a lot of commandments about you.

263
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,860
Yeah, because until you're 18 and I kick you all out,

264
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,400
I'm the most important person here. Okay?

265
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,720
Uh, Mom, I think Ben needs our help.

266
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,820
Hey, stay. Which leads us to number four.

267
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,550
"Do not interrupt Mom."

268
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,340
Piece of shit.

269
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,600
Ben, are you okay?

270
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,400
No, I'm not.

273
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,650
While dollar bills are traded through a bank,

274
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,510
Makob is traded peer to peer.

275
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,870
Once you have Makobs, what can you do with them?

277
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,780
Spend them. More and more retailers

278
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,890
are accepting Makob as a method of payment.

279
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,840
You can purchase anything from computer parts,

281
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,960
toiletries to pet supplies.

282
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,460
In a global economy, Makob is the new frontier.

284
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,570
- Makob? What is that? - It's a coin.

285
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,010
A cryptocurrency. Like Bitcoin.

286
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,030
Like Doge. Like Ethereum.

287
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,280
But this one is Makob, see?

288
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,920
It's real. It's solid.

289
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,900
And it's trading for $11.30 per coin.

290
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,210
That trades for eleven dollars?

291
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,410
No, it's like a billboard for the real thing.

292
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,490
The real thing is in here.

293
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,720
So, your goal this week is to get Makob

294
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,220
to trade for $135 per coin.

295
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,040
Wait.

296
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,720
$135 for what?

297
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,250
It's-it's not real.

298
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,940
- What is real? - I-- Okay.

299
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,890
This desk, my purse, but not, but not that.

300
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,960
I can sell anything.

301
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,990
But if it's just there, uh, how do I do that?

302
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,290
That's up to you.

303
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,930
You have a team of 30 employees, all minimum wage millennials

304
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,120
with meaningless promises of stock options.

305
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,870
They all work for me?

306
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,260
They work for Makob.

307
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,210
And this is your executive assistant...

308
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,980
- Taylor. - Hello, ma'am.

309
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,910
- I'm Sheryl. - Got to go.

310
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,610
Remember that moment in Working Girl

311
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,810
where Harrison Ford says, "Make me money

312
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,050
- or I'm gonna kill you"? - Mm, no.

313
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,870
Well, get Makob up to $135

314
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,780
or I'm gonna kill you.

315
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,770
Taylor will keep me posted on your progress.

316
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,450
So, Taylor, um,

317
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,630
why don't you call the team together and we can get...

318
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,810
Taylor?

319
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,850
- Taylor? - Okay, Boomer.

321
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,950
Hello, I'm-I'm Sheryl Luria.

322
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,510
And I know I-I'm new here, but...

323
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,190
Everybody, uh...

324
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,800
Sorry, I-I just need a minute, okay?

325
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,750
I-I just want to say there's-there's no

326
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,660
bad ideas here, all right?

327
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,700
I just want to hear your thoughts,

328
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,490
so why don't we all just gather into my office

329
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,100
- for a minute and... - It's okay. Just keep working.

330
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,670
Who are you?

331
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,120
The office manager.

332
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,480
The best thing for you to do is go back to your office

333
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,410
and do some online shopping and let us do your work for you.

334
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,850
Okay, Boomer?

335
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,940
Mr. Hurt to the rescue!

337
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,660
Come on, Ben. Answer the phone, or open the door.

338
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,990
I'm not leaving until you do one or the other.

339
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,300
I've got two phones.

340
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,180
I'm calling all of yours.

342
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,520
- Go away, Karima. - Nope.

343
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,800
In fact, I know how to Skype you, too.

345
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,080
Oh, my God.

346
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,130
How many phones do you have?

347
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,050
As many as I need.

348
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,300
What's going on with you?

349
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,190
Nothing. It's called a siesta.

350
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,740
Your little Catholic friends called worried about you.

351
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,290
There's an exorcism or something they need you at.

352
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,220
Okay, what the fuck?!

353
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,320
- Get up. - Why?

354
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,670
Because you're worrying me.

355
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,870
Look at yourself. You look depressed.

356
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,820
I am not depressed.

357
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,330
I was diagnosed as culturally derealized

358
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,280
by a bunch of 12-year-olds.

359
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,180
- Culturally... - Derealized.

360
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,770
It means disgusted with the insanity of reality.

361
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,820
- What insanity? - Um, the cases

362
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,620
that I have been trying to solve that don't make any sense.

363
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,000
Photos of angels, a soul-weighing machine,

364
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,950
my girlfriend with a twin attached?

365
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,700
I try to figure out these cases

366
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,300
that don't make any sense.

367
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,980
And then we just move on to the next thing.

368
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,860
Ben, sit down.

369
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,080
Actually, you know, I was sitting down.

370
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,070
- I was actually laying down. - Listen to me.

371
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,650
I'm taking you out tonight.

372
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,190
W-What? Where?

373
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,840
The Super Secret Science League. It's a group.

374
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,380
50 scientists and programmers who examine the world.

375
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,320
What the fuck are you talking about?

376
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,370
I'm inviting you. You need to talk to people

377
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,600
who talk your language, who aren't shoving

378
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,370
- angels and ghosts at you. - Super Secret what?

379
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,510
Science League. Ignore the name. We're voting on a better name.

380
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,050
Some people at work invited me, so I'm inviting you.

381
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,500
What is it, like, a Mensa thing?

383
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,070
No, these are actually smart people.

384
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,900
Tonight. I'm taking you.

385
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,970
You need a steadying influence.

386
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,280
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

387
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,610
Okay, and, um, you didn't live together before your wedding?

388
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,180
And how is that going?

389
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,690
Sharing space, being around each other more.

390
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,100
We both had roommates before.

391
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,890
College roommates. I had three.

392
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,830
So we're used to living with other people.

393
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,950
All right.

394
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,920
I'd love to try some role-playing,

395
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,350
if you're up for it.

396
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,030
Would you get up?

397
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,060
- Okay. - Sure.

398
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,810
This is gonna be good.

399
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,990
Face each other.

400
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,080
Who usually initiates sex?

401
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,000
Probably me.

402
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,560
Actually, I'd say equal.

403
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,690
Amalia, why don't you act out how Leo initiates sex?

404
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,430
Really?

405
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,120
Well, usually, uh, he gets this...

406
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,830
...look on his face.

407
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,450
Okay, okay, well, act it out. Bring him into it.

408
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,540
You did this.

409
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,830
Sister, can I help you?

410
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,790
No, David asked me to take notes.

411
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,950
Oh, I-I'm taking my own notes.

412
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,950
Leo, Amalia.

413
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,450
Hi.

414
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,290
Um, could I talk to you for just a minute?

415
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,450
Sister, uh, marital therapy is-is very sensitive.

416
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,200
Yes, and it seems to be going well.

417
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,160
Yes, but only if

418
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,450
the subjects feel completely open.

419
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,410
Kristen, right?

420
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,200
Yeah.

421
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,910
I'm not here to undercut your therapy, ma'am,

422
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,620
but there's a spiritual component here that...

423
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,490
And I would agree, but the spiritual

424
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,790
needs to come after the pragmatic.

425
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,540
I hadn't finished.

426
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,370
There's a spiritual, and even supernatural component here.

427
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,500
That is how I can help you.

428
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,950
- Are you finished? - Yes.

429
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,910
Your, um...

430
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,750
- presence, ma'am... - Sister.

431
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,830
Your presence, Sister, is, um, well,

432
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,290
it's keeping these newlyweds from speaking honestly.

433
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,450
I mean, we are talking about sex,

434
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,490
and a nun's presence can keep these people

435
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,080
from-from speaking their minds freely.

436
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,250
- Let me be blunt, ma'am... - Doctor.

437
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,620
Doctor.

438
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,500
I can see something you cannot.

439
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,910
There is a demon between those two.

440
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,830
It's trying to possess them.

441
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,870
The good news here is that it's in pain,

442
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,870
and being diminished by your questioning.

443
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
How much are we speaking metaphorically?

444
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,580
I never speak metaphorically.

445
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,580
You need me in there, Doctor.

446
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,040
I can tell you when your therapy is diminishing a demon,

447
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,750
or encouraging one.

448
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,910
Okay, this is what I say.

449
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,990
If I feel like your presence is keeping these newlyweds

450
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,200
from speaking honestly, then I need you to excuse yourself.

451
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,200
I need you to agree with me.

452
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,870
I agree with you.

453
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,370
Good.

454
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,790
I know you both are religious, but...

455
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,290
you know, sex is just between the two of you.

456
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,790
If you think of it as something holy,

457
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,000
it can smother desire.

458
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,410
This is blasphemy.

459
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,950
You're a fucking nun. Tell her.

460
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:59,540
You and I, we have business.

461
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,120
Bring it on.

462
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,080
Oh, my God, I need this.

463
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,330
- Don't leave, Rad-G. - I'm not going that far.

464
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,540
I found a house two blocks away,

465
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,830
and I expect you to come over every single day.

466
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,660
- Can I? - Well, just so you do,

467
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,370
I'm taking my book back.

468
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,620
What's that?

469
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,580
That's the ten commandments.

471
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,370
Really? "Thou shalt not ever lie to Mom."

472
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,410
"Don't..." uh, wait, these are all from your mom?

473
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,540
Want to see what we did?

474
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,450
Sure.

475
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,490
These are our ten commandments.

477
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,040
You girls?

478
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,290
We decided we needed some other ones for school,

479
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,490
or else we'll get beat up.

480
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,290
Let's see.

481
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,870
"Don't hit first, but hit back."

482
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,370
- That's Lynn's. - No, it's good,

483
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,790
it should just be "hit back harder."

484
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,370
- Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah.

485
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,830
- "Sisters before misters," love that. - Yes.

486
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,790
"If you can't be popular, be scary."

487
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
I could actually use these at work.

488
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,160
- What's wrong with work? - Mm, same as at school.

489
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,000
There's a lot of bullying going on.

490
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,700
Yeah, you should.

492
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,950
This one's mine. "Influence the influencers."

493
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,740
What the heck does that mean?

494
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,200
It's based on Malindaz.

495
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,660
You get popular and then no one can hurt you.

496
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,120
Who's Malindaz?

497
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,620
So, why me?

498
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,750
Because you're one of the top influencers.

499
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,620
And I need an influencer.

500
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,750
And what is this?

501
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,410
It's Makob.

502
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,500
The latest cryptocurrency.

503
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,410
I'm giving you a chance to get in on the ground floor.

505
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,410
It's the same thing Reese Witherspoon did with Ethereum,

507
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,870
or Paris Hilton.

508
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,450
And what do I get out of it?

509
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,950
20,000 Makobs.

510
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,450
No.

511
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,290
Look, it's, um...

512
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,910
it's like a stock option.

513
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,540
20,000 Makobs can mean everything

514
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,910
if you can get the value up.

516
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,790
Have you ever heard of the Fyre Festival?

517
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,830
- Yeah. - Well, a lot of influencers

518
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,660
got burned recommending a festival that was bullshit.

519
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,450
The only thing that made it worthwhile

520
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,870
is that they were given $50,000 to $100,000 up front.

521
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,540
You pay me $100,000, and I'll say whatever you want.

522
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,700
I'll give you $10,000 cash now and the rest after you say it.

523
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,830
This is the place. Science League.

524
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,330
Yeah, I'm getting a very high school virgin vibe.

525
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,330
Why are there so many dudes here?

526
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,450
Wait, is that why you come here?

527
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,540
Ben, stop it.

528
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,910
Oh, my God, are you husband-hunting in Nerd Narnia?

529
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,330
- Just give it a chance. - Okay, all right.

530
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,830
But if one person comes up to me and says any nerd cliche,

531
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,540
- I am... - Greetings, Earthlings.

532
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,750
Whoa, what was that?

533
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,330
UAC! Put it on the board, sir!

535
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,580
New guys have to pass the test

536
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,200
to get into the Demo Club.

537
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,450
Okay, what's the test?

538
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,290
- You got to blow something up. - With what?

539
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,200
With whatever you can find in the kitchen.

540
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,620
You and your sister, you have three minutes.

541
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,200
Two thirty.

542
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,700
One minute.

543
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,160
Okay, here we go.

544
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,410
Oh, yes!

545
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,580
This is the asteroid Bennu.

546
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,080
And this is the NASA spacecraft Osiris-rex.

547
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,370
Now, what is odd is that NASA has discovered

548
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,200
that Bennu keeps spitting out rocks.

549
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,120
Some of the rocks Bennu spits out are hazards.

550
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,700
You were right about this.

551
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,950
I'm always right.

552
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,240
Ha, right. Fine.

553
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,250
Then help me.

554
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,790
Help me solve all the weird things

555
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,240
that have happened recently.

556
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,950
Sure. But listen to him.

557
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,700
There's an asteroid that spits out rocks.

558
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,750
And scientists have no idea why it's happening.

559
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,740
The orbit of Bennu is intrinsically...

560
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,950
Yeah, but that's not like demons.

561
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,870
I agree,

562
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,540
but still, as scientists, we have to acknowledge

563
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,700
when something is beyond our knowledge.

564
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,580
Yeah, but that's not the same as believing in God.

565
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,040
Allah?

566
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,950
Sure, Allah.

567
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,040
I don't believe in Allah. It's just true.

568
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,240
You don't believe in something that's true,

569
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,450
like the room you're standing in.

570
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,700
Okay, please, don't get all Socratic on me.

571
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,160
You don't believe that it's real, it just is.

572
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,290
Because I can see it.

573
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,910
Well, who's to say that's not a deepfake?

574
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,290
Okay. Okay, Karima,

575
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,910
please don't try to get me to believe in God.

576
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,700
Okay? Just help me.

577
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,120
Sure. I'll drop by.

578
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,790
Good.

579
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,160
...who entered a Name that Asteroid contest,

580
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,410
uh, run by the University of Arizona.

581
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,830
So, roughly 100 million miles from the Sun...

583
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,660
So the first color you should work with

584
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,700
from your eyeshadow palette is caramel blush.

585
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,450
And mix it with, like, a little bit of light latte.

586
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,540
And while you do that, I want to talk about

587
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,040
a cool new investment you should look at.

588
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,290
Makob.

589
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,290
Bitcoin is for billionaires,

590
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,410
not working girls like us.

591
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,580
You want to get in on the ground floor

592
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,740
of a cryptocurrency, and trust me,

593
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,120
- it's Makob. - Rad-G.

594
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,250
You know who I fantasized about last night?

595
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,660
You.

596
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,500
You were so hot.

597
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,750
- Hey, Sister. - Leo.

598
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,950
Amalia.

599
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,290
- It's not going well. - What's not?

600
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,330
Your counseling. The demon's larger. It's in control.

601
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,990
Sister, I... I need to do what I do.

602
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,790
I know, but do it better.

603
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,120
So, how did it go?

604
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,540
- Good... - Yeah?

605
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,450
...I think.

606
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,160
Yes, uh...

607
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,330
we did everything just as you said.

608
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:22,700
So no more, um, hives or nausea?

609
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,790
No.

610
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,950
Okay, let me break this down.

611
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,240
The amount of time that you guys spent intentionally avoiding

612
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,330
physical intimacy has conditioned your bodies

613
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,450
to illicit this negative response.

614
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,450
Did you try the role-playing?

615
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,750
Yeah, but, um...

616
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,950
It was...

617
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,580
Awkward. Just really weird.

618
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,000
Oh, weird's good.

619
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,370
I'd love to try one more thing, if you're open to it.

620
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,910
I'd like to split you two up.

621
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,910
If you wanted to be alone with me,

622
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,290
all you had to do was ask.

623
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,370
Don't flatter yourself.

624
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,330
What do you want?

625
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:25,000
I could never resist a nun's sexy ankles.

626
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,410
You know you're losing. So just lose.

627
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,750
Mr. Townsend.

628
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,950
What is the issue today?

629
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,120
Sister Andrea.

630
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,950
And her health issues.

631
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Amalia.

632
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,790
Our imagination is a really important tool

633
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,160
in figuring out what we want in bed.

634
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,790
I've never thought about another man in my life.

635
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,700
I know. I know, I know.

636
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,080
But sex is something you don't want to domesticate.

637
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,660
You want it to run wild.

638
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,290
That's why I split you two up.

639
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,580
I want you to surprise each other.

640
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,790
I want you to stop thinking about God.

641
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,450
I want you to do what your body

642
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,750
wants you to do.

643
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,910
Leo, do you have a minute?

644
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,790
Sure.

645
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,290
Congratulations, influencees.

646
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,990
Not only do you look great-- and I love that shade

647
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,160
of lipstick, by the way-- but you're rich!

648
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,200
If you got in on the ground floor with Makob,

649
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,160
it has gone from ten dollars

650
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,080
to $27!

651
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
- That's right. - Oh, my God.

652
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,330
If you invested just, like, $500

653
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,910
with Makob-- and if you didn't, I feel sorry for you--

654
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,290
you are now worth...

655
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,450
$10,000!

656
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,950
Yes! Yahoo!

657
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,370
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

658
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,450
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. - Are you okay?

659
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,740
Taylor. How are you?

660
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,660
- I'm good, ma'am. How are you? - Good.

661
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,240
Did you get the chocolates I sent you?

662
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,080
I did. They're very good.

663
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,580
Congratulations, by the way.

664
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,040
Thank you. Bobby!

665
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,580
Get in here. Now.

666
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,950
Move it.

667
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,700
Close the door.

668
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,410
Taylor, um, it's a new day,

669
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,410
and your services will no longer be needed here.

670
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,990
Okay. Well, I'm not resigning,

671
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,620
- and you can't fire me. - That's true.

672
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,950
Leland did put you at that desk to spy on me,

673
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,620
but here's the thing--

674
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,290
and, Bobby, I want you to pay close attention.

675
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,870
I checked your entrance interview,

676
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,540
and you're allergic to Brazil nuts.

677
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,120
And you know what?

678
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,910
There was some in that chocolate I gave you.

679
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,910
No. No, no, no, no.

680
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,790
I-I, uh, I took it. Your epinephrine.

681
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,330
No, no. No, no, no.

682
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,620
Here is a resignation letter,

683
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,410
Taylor.

684
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,990
Before your little throat swells up

685
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,370
and you choke on your own vomit,

686
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,750
I would sign it.

687
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sign it.

688
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,750
Good girl.

689
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,290
No. No, no, no. I insist on seeing you out. Let's go, let's go.

690
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,000
Shoo.

691
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,910
Thank you for your service.

692
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,990
Your security card will be deactivated,

693
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,410
and your belongings will be mailed

694
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,040
to your home address.

695
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,370
I know. It must be so hard.

696
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,450
I get emotional, too. Just try not to panic.

697
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,750
Everyone has their weaknesses, Bobby.

698
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,120
Don't make me find yours.

699
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,160
Yes, ma'am.

700
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,790
Now get back to work.

701
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,540
Faster, you fucking millennial.

702
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,790
So, what do you think?

703
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
I think

704
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,370
I desire you.

705
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,660
And I do you.

706
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,910
Say it.

707
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,200
- I just did. - No. You said,

708
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,620
"And I do you."

709
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,120
Say it.

710
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,700
I want you.

711
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,950
What?

712
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,830
Say it.

713
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,540
I want...

714
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,620
to fuck you.

715
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,080
I'm sorry.

716
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm sorry.

717
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,250
What? Amalia, I'm sorry. I-I thought...

718
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,290
I thought you wanted it.

719
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,450
I thought...

720
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,000
Fuck me now or I'll kill you.

721
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,950
I want you so much.

722
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,450
Prove it, fucker.

726
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,870
Okay. All your nonsense,

727
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,490
all the nonsense you're getting from your religious coworkers,

728
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,700
I'm gonna solve with you.

729
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,580
The two of us.

730
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,240
And anything we can't solve,

731
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,410
we're taking to the Secret Science League.

732
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,620
You know why?

733
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,160
- Why? - Because this is what I believe.

734
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,910
Everything that God has given is solvable.

735
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,000
So, what do you got first?

736
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,700
Hey, guys.

737
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,080
What's up?

738
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,580
Hey.

739
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,370
Did you do something to yourself?

740
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,950
You seem to have a lot more...

741
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,910
something.

742
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,990
Hanging around with new people, new places.

743
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,160
Doing new things.

744
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,500
Boom!

745
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,790
- "Boom"? - Yeah.

746
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,950
Boom.

747
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,950
Come on.

748
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,950
It's like a huge weight's been lifted from our shoulders.

749
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,330
That's great. Ben can look over your house

750
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,660
and make sure there's no toxicity.

751
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,910
No, we're good. Your suggestions of fantasizing really worked.

752
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,700
I'm so glad.

753
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,990
That's great.

754
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,660
*Let me call you sweetheart*

755
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,410
Are you sure?

756
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,620
Yes, we are, Sister.

757
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,410
Leave us alone, Sister.

758
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,290
We're happy, the three of us.

759
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,660
I'm glad you came in.

760
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,370
- I'm glad it worked out. - It did.

761
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,740
Thank you, Kristen.

762
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,160
You're so welcome.

763
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,740
You asked to see me, Monsignor?

764
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,330
Yes, Sister.

765
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,120
I expect you'd like me to shut the door.

766
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,080
Please.

767
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,660
If you would...

768
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,950
Have you been feeling all right lately?

769
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,370
I've been feeling like I always have.

770
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,700
Perfectly fine.

771
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,160
Has the Mother Superior said something

772
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,830
- about my work? - No.

773
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,040
But you've been observed lately

774
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,410
acting in a manner that may suggest ill health.

775
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,330
Really?

776
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,500
In what way?

777
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:47,290
I don't mean any disrespect, Sister, but I have noticed

778
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,620
an unsteadiness of gait.

779
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,910
And of hand.

780
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,580
That time when you were serving the monsignor and myself

781
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,870
and you accidentally poured tea in my lap.

782
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:01,120
There is an accelerating forgetfulness.

783
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,450
Understandable as time takes its toll.

784
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,410
What is most concerning of all,

785
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,200
others, like me, have witnessed an unsettling tendency

786
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,160
toward hallucination.

787
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,700
What others?

788
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,450
It is only out of concern

789
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:22,040
that we feel compelled to point out what we have seen.

790
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,330
Thank you, Sister.

791
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,540
You may return to your duties.

792
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,580
I'm not to be permitted to defend myself?

793
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,370
There's no need to defend yourself, Sister.

794
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,450
We are all part of God's community.

795
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,040
You're excused.

796
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,950
I think it's better if I stay.

797
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,950
No. But thank you.

798
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,620
David, do you mind closing the door?

799
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,500
And, Leland, do you mind stepping out, too?

800
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,000
Are you sure?

801
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,580
Yes. I just need a moment.

802
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,620
I'll make this brief. There have been reports

803
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,330
that Sister Andrea is in declining health.

804
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,660
Declining? How?

805
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,160
Some physical but also cognitive.

806
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,750
The worry is...

807
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,950
liability.

808
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,830
I work closely with the sister.

809
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,750
No, David, I don't need to hear from you.

810
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,000
I know you two are friends.

811
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,450
In fact, do you mind stepping out, too?

812
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,200
Are you sure, Monsignor?

813
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,950
Yes, David. Please.

814
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,830
In terms of any mental issues, Ms. Bouchard,

815
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:50,080
I'm anxious to hear what you've observed.

816
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,950
I'm hearing that Sister Andrea

817
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,500
is talking to imaginary figures.

818
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,120
Is that true?

819
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,790
No, not at all.

820
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,660
She's been good.

821
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,330
Thank you for your help, Sister.

822
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,080
You're welcome,

823
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,540
Doctor.
