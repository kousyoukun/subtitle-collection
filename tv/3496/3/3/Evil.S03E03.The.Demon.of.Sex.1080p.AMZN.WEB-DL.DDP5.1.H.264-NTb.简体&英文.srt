And, Leland, do you mind stepping out, too?

00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,000

Are you sure?

801
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,580

Yes. I just need a moment.

I'll make this brief. There have been reports

803
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,330
����������Ů�Ľ���״��ÿ������
that Sister Andrea is in declining health.

Declining? How?

805
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,160
��Щ�������ϵ�  ����Щ����֪�����
Some physical but also cognitive.

The worry is...

liability.

808

I work closely with the sister.

No, David, I don't need to hear from you.

I know you two are friends.

In fact, do you mind stepping out, too?

Are you sure, Monsignor?

Yes, David. Please.

In terms of any mental issues, Ms. Bouchard,

815
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:50,080
�Һ������������۲쵽��
I'm anxious to hear what you've observed.

I'm hearing that Sister Andrea

817
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,500

is talking to imaginary figures.

818
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,120

Is that true?

819
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,790

No, not at all.

820
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,660

She's been good.

Thank you for your help, Sister.

You're welcome,
