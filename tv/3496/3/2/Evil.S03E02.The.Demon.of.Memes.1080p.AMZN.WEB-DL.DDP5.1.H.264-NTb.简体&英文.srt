以圣父
In the name of the Father,

10
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,040
圣子和圣灵的名义
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

11
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,890
原谅我  神父  我有罪
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

12
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,380
距离我上次忏悔已经一天了
It's been one day since my last confession.

13
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,790
以下是我的罪过
These are my sins.

14
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,370
我一直在生我妹妹的气
I've been angry at my sister.

15
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,250
我没有念念珠
I failed to pray the rosary.

16
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,470
我在药店排队时
I got really mad

17
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,640
发了很大的脾气
in line at the drug store.

18
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,480
...以圣子和圣灵的名义
...Son, the Holy Spirit.

19
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,600
距离我上次忏悔已经过去一个月了
It's been a month since my last confession.

20
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,010
以下是我的罪过
These are my sins.

21
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,340
我讨厌我的丈夫
I hate my husband.

22
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,770
他老是把脏盘子放在水槽里
He puts dishes in the sink

23
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,190
尽管我跟他说过无数次
even when I've told him 100 times

24
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,290
要把它们放在洗碗机里
to put them in the dishwasher.

25
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,180
然后他也不倒垃圾
Then he doesn't take out the garbage.

26
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,890
他觉得这是女人的工作
He thinks it's women's work.

27
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,530
请问  有什么不是女人的工作
Well, what isn't women's work?

28
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,440
欢迎参加早上6点的弥撒
Welcome to the 6:00 a.M. Mass.

29
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,640
我们像往常一样开始吧
Let us begin as we always do.

30
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,630
以圣父
In the name of the Father,

31
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,480
圣子和圣灵的名义
the Son, Holy Spirit.

32
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,660
阿门
Amen.

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,940
谁
Hello?

34
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,710
你好
Hello.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,230
你有什么事吗
May I help you?

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,500
你认得我吗
Do you recognize me?

37
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,310
维克托·莱孔特
Victor LeConte?

38
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,460
你知道我是做什么的吗
Do you know what I do?

39
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,150
你是梵蒂冈特勤局的
You work with the Vatican Secret Service.

40
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,050
"圣体"
The Entity.

41
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,230
根本不存在圣体  大卫
There is no Entity, David.

42
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,890
只不过是...梵蒂冈的朋友们
There are merely... friends of the Vatican.

43
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,040
有些是大使  有些是教区牧师
Some are ambassadors, some parish priests.

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,000
有些在情报部门工作
Some work in intelligence--

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,120
中央情报局  军情六处  对外安全总局
the CIA, MI6, DGSE.

46
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,960
他们提供信息和帮助
They offer information and assistance.

47
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,510
就这样  没什么神秘之处
That's all. There's nothing mysterious about it.

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,700
这是关于RSM育儿机构吗
Is this about RSM Fertility?

49
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,570
我有个问题要问你  大卫
I have a question for you, David.

50
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,560
你不打算回答我的问题吗
You're not going to answer my question.

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,550
你的问题无关紧要
Your question is irrelevant.

52
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,020
你为什么当牧师
Why are you a priest?

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,950
为上帝服务
To serve God.

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,920
那是什么
What is that?

55
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,450
你的个人资料
Your profile.

56
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,970
你认为你在这里是在侍奉上帝吗
And do you believe that you are serving God here?

57
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,260
我不清楚
I don't know.

58
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,060
我不知道上帝需要什么
I don't know what God wants.

59
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,050
如果我知道上帝想要什么  你会意外吗
Would it surprise you to learn that I do know what God wants?

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,010
会
Yes.

61
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,000
上帝希望你成为梵蒂冈的朋友
God wants you to be a friend of the Vatican.

62
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,840
那...我该怎么做呢
And... how do I do that?

63
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,730
说你愿意
Say yes.

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,360
愿意什么
To?

65
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,720
你想为世界做好事
You want to do good in the world.

66
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,790
你想对抗邪恶
You want to fight evil.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,740
但你在这里深感无聊
And yet you're bored here.

68
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,960
你在生自己的气  因为你厌倦了
And you're angry at yourself for being bored.

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,600
但你看不出
But you can't see the connection

70
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,730
所有这些没人参加的弥撒
between all of these poorly-attended masses,

71
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,350
所有这些忏悔
all these confessions

72
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,460
和世上的邪恶之间有什么联系
and the evil in the world.

73
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,880
你在监视我吗
You're watching me?

74
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,910
我们用不着监视你
We don't need to watch you.

75
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,980
纽约发生了一些邪恶的事情
There's something happening in New York that is evil.

76
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,530
作为一个评估者  你看到了
As an assessor, you see it.

77
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,690
但这不仅仅是超自然现象
But it is not just supernatural.

78
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,700
它也是有形的
It is also corporeal.

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,190
下周某个时候你会接到一个电话
You will receive a call sometime in the next week,

80
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,550
要求你执行一项任务
asking you to perform a task.

81
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,750
什么任务
What task?

82
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,620
你会知道它来自梵蒂冈
You will know that it is from the Vatican

83
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,060
因为它会有这样一句话
because it will be preceded by this phrase:

84
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,160
"主之意志"
"Is est a Deo habetur."

85
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,800
"这是上帝的意志"
"And it is deemed by God."

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,070
你必须毫无异议地执行此任务
You must perform this task without question

87
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,360
明白吗
do you understand?

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,350
你在招募我吗
You're recruiting me?

89
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,650
我需要你说愿意
I need you to say yes.

90
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,150
我要告诉大主教
I need to tell the Monsignor.

91
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,220
不行
No.

92
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,420
跟你聊天很开心
It was good to talk to you.

93
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,850
等等
Wait.

94
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,400
你想我说愿意吗
You want a yes?

95
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,820
是的
Yes.

96
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,780
如果你答应了  就不能告诉任何人
And if you say yes, you cannot tell anyone.

97
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,750
不能告诉大主教
Not the Monsignor,

98
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,290
也不能告诉你的修女朋友和你的世俗伙伴
not your nun friend, none of your secular associates.

99
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,280
如果你同意  你就是梵蒂冈的朋友
If you say yes, you will be a friend of the Vatican.

100
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,350
这是个重任
And that is a burden.

101
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,530
但没人逼你回答
But no one is forcing you to respond.

102
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,980
你自己决定
That is up to you.

103
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,500
我做了一点调查
So I did a little research,

104
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,360
再加一间卧室
and to add one more bedroom,

105
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,710
总共要8万美元
it would be 80,000, all in.

106
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,550
再加上浴室呢
And the bathroom?

107
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,160
再加9万
Separate, 90,000.

108
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,480
还要9万
Another 90?

109
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,910
我们应该以八万五千美元的价格卖掉
We're supposed to be selling the trekking business

110
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,080
徒步旅行业务
for $85,000.

111
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,250
我们还欠...抵押贷款8万
And we still owe... 80,000 on the mortgage.

112
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,270
好吧  那...
Okay, so...

113
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,140
我只要找一份工资
well, I just have to try and get a job that pays

114
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,220
在7.5万左右的工作就行了吧
what, in the range of 75,000?

115
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,360
我的工资是6万  但是
My job pays 60,000, but...

116
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,140
它还支付了孩子们一半的学费
it also pays for half the kids' tuition

117
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,560
和我们的医疗费用
and our health care.

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,470
我们可以把孩子送到公立学校来省钱
We could save by sending the kids to public school.

119
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,290
劳拉  拜托
Laura, please!

120
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,520
妈妈  公立学校
Mom, they have bomb threats

121
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,110
-有炸弹威胁  -别这么夸张
- at the public school. - Don't be melodramatic.

122
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,570
-她没夸张  是真的  -妈妈  水槽又堵了
- She's not. It's true. - Mom, the sink is clogged again.

123
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,090
别碰它
Don't touch it.

124
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,650
-妈  我想要自己的房间  -你要自己的房间
- Mom, I want my own room. - You want your own room?

125
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,120
孩子们  孩子们
Guys, guys,

126
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,570
孩子们  孩子们
guys, guys!

127
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,450
除非你们能在煤矿场找到工作
Unless you girls get jobs in the coal mines,

128
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,820
这间卧室是给你爸妈住的
this is one for your parents.

129
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,000
-好吗  好  -那算了吧
- Okay? Okay. - I'm gonna pass on that.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,300
-好了  上楼去  -你们总是拒绝我们的一切要求
- Okay, go upstairs. - You say no to everything.

131
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,430
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night, now.

132
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,510
我不...我们可以...
So I don't... do we just...

133
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,620
可以直接雇一个承包商来做吗
do we just hire a contractor and start in?

134
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,030
嗯  得先拿到贷款
Yeah, we got to get the loans first.

135
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,600
-这些钱用来干什么  -那是我妈妈
- What about these earnings? - Oh, that's my mom

136
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,130
-想在车库上花的钱  -不
- paying 2,000 in the garage. - No.

137
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,960
-天啊  不要  -不  我也不想这样
- Oh, God, no. - No, I'm not advocating for it.

138
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,440
只是...  这个就算了吧
I'm saying that's, you know... strike that.

139
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,250
好的  我会试试
Okay, so I'm just gonna, I'm gonna try

140
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,390
把徒步旅行业务多卖点钱

00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,000
你要在七天内做完七个任务  不然就会死
You have seven licks in seven days or you're dead.

283
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,240
我去哪里找任务
Where do I find the licks?

284
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,840
你从哪里看到的图片就去哪里找
The same place that you looked at the photo.

285
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,170
你是从哪里看到的
Where did you look at it?

286
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
你没看它吧
You-you didn't look at it, did you?

287
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,290
-雷  -琳  别去看它
- Ren... - Lynn, do not look at it, okay?

288
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,700
它会把你拖入地狱
It'll drag you to hell.

289
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,620
就像学校里的韦恩那样
Like Wayne from school.

290
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,060
他们说他吞枪自杀了  但其实是"来访杰克"干的
They said he shot himself, but it was Visiting Jack.

291
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,050
{\an8}近期横跨五区的离奇火灾时间线

292
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,190
好  我现在去查看他的浏览器历史记录
Okay, I'm gonna check his browser history.

293
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,980
你认识这个自杀的孩子韦恩吗
Do you know this kid, Wayne, who committed suicide?

294
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,920
不认识
No.

295
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,180
他在圣安德烈高中上学
He goes to St. Andre's.

296
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,330
他用他爸爸的枪自杀了
He shot himself with his dad's gun.

297
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,090
我们为此举办过祷告会
We had a prayer assembly about it.

298
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,250
你认得这个地址吗
Do you recognize this address?

299
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,420
不认识
No.

300
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,140
他去过这个地方吗
Has he ever gone to this address?

301
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,590
没有  他放学后都直接回家
No. He comes right home after school.

302
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,220
你认得吗
Do you recognize it?

303
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,240
不认得
No.

304
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,400
妈妈  我不认得
Mom, I don't.

305
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,160
我想到一个方法
Okay, one thought.

306
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,420
斯坦威街54号
Hmm, 54 Steinway.

307
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,930
斯坦威街56号
56 Steinway.

308
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,680
58号  街对面
58... across the street...

309
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,310
这里
There.

310
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,220
楼上有什么
What's upstairs?

311
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,350
{\an8}警告
此地址应用户要求被屏蔽

312
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:13,970
"来访杰克"吗
Visiting Jack?

313
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,200
或许我们本来就不应该看它
Maybe we shouldn't be looking at this anyway.

314
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,300
雷说别看
Ren said not to.

315
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,550
琳
Lynn.

316
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,200
你应该知道这是假的吧
You know it's just make-believe, right?

317
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,660
人们以恐吓他人为乐而已
People enjoy scaring each other, that's it.

318
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,470
我知道  但是
I know, but...

319
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,790
或许我们就不应该看它
maybe we shouldn't be looking anyway.

320
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,450
所以我做错了什么
So what am I doing wrong?

321
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,930
你没有做错什么  你只是不够聪明而已
You're not doing anything wrong, you're just not that smart.

322
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,080
-谢谢你啊  -让开
- Thank you. - Just get out of my way.

323
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,620
我们用网站时光机就好了
We just use the Wayback Machine.

324
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,740
我试过了
I already did that.

325
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,240
那你没有用过进阶版
You didn't use the Wayback

326
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,450
-网站时光机  -别扯了
- Wayback Machine. - Really? Come on.

327
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,550
这是我自己写的应用程序
An app of my own creation.

328
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,460
然后我们就可以找到
And we'll find--

329
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,610
看好了
let's see--

330
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,840
一份更早的迭代
an even earlier iteration.

331
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,500
好了
There.

332
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,450
看吧
Ta-da.

333
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,780
看来有人真的很不希望你
Someone really doesn't want you to see

334
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,510
看到楼上的窗户里有什么
what's in that upstairs window.

335
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,000
嗯
Yeah, well...

336
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,170
这是个诅咒
there's a curse.

337
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,730
一个诅咒
A curse?

338
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,410
-你认真的吗  -是的
- Really? - Yeah.

339
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,550
如果你看到  你就得在七天里
If you see it you have to perform seven tasks

340
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,340
完成七个任务  不然它就会杀了你
in seven days or it'll kill you.

341
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,130
-你做这份工作还能拿钱吗  -相信我
- And you get paid for this job? - Believe me,

342
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,700
这甚至不是这个月发生的最离奇的事情
it's not even the strangest thing this month.

343
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,870
你还想看看它
Well, do you still want to see it

344
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,590
还是我们就不管它了
or should we let it go?

345
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,830
继续看看
Yeah, go.

346
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,730
挖深一层
Okay, one level deeper.

347
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,820
这是什么
Mm, what is that?

348
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,950
进阶进阶版
The Wayback, Wayback,

349
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,140
-网站时光机吗  -嘘
- Wayback Machine? - Shh.

350
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,540
好了
Okay, here we go.

351
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,000
一份更早的迭代
One more iteration.

352
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,530
-有了  -真不错
- There. - Mmm, nice.

353
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,320
我感觉被诅咒了
I'm feeling cursed.

354
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,630
靠
Fuck.

355
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,710
{\an8}《恐怖事物立体书》

356
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:58,730
{\an8}流行语恶魔

357
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,850
{\an8}邪恶
第三季第二集

358
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,990
早上好
Morning.

359
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,310
你好
Hi.

360
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,750
利兰  我  我来这里做什么
Leland, what-what am I doing here?

361
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,710
我们在工作
We're working.

362
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,140
什么样的工作
What-what kind of work?

363
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,290
可以让你住上新房的工作
The work that will pay for your new home.

364
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,040
那种能让你外孙女都住得下的大房子
The new home that will keep your grandkids near.

365
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,150
你好
Oh. Hi.

366
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,560
这是你的工作
This is your job.

367
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,940
你需要让人们不停浏览负面消息
You're to keep the people doomscrolling.

368
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,230
使他们专注于电脑里的东西
Keep them glued to their computer.

369
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,990
让他们会看到新的政治斗争
So they're reading about the new political fight

370
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,770
{\an8}参议院投票权立法停滞不前
国内恐怖主义

371
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,630
经济状况
or the economy

372
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,580
{\an8}股票市场崩溃
三大指标纷纷跌至谷底  科技股遭受重创

373
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,200
全球变暖和疫情
or global warming, plagues.

374
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,480
{\an8}病毒释放
全球变暖可能会释放出古老的病毒病原体
从而导致地球上所有人类的死亡

375
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,740
-所以我们还能控制疫情了  -不
- So we control plagues? - No.

376
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,870
是地狱之父在掌控
The father below controls plagues.

377
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,640
但我们掌控大众应对负面消息的方式
But we control how people react to plagues.

378
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,820
目前  那才是一切
And these days, that is everything.

379
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,770
几个世纪之前  80%由路西法控制
Centuries ago, it was 80% Lucifer,

380
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,280
20%的人是他的追随者
and 20% his followers.

381
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,960
如今情况正好相反
Now that's been reversed.

382
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,690
所以  基本来说
So, basically,

383
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,690
-我是个在网络上恶意挑衅的人  -嘿
- I'm a troll. - Hey,

384
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,550
恶意挑衅也是个光荣的职位
trolling is an honored profession.

385
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,040
他们就像是地狱之父棋盘上的骑士
Trolls are the knights of the father's chessboard.

386
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,910
我只是觉得黑暗的力量
I guess I just thought the powers of darkness

387
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,230
会更...黑暗
would be more, you know... dark.

388
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,760
的确黑暗
It is dark.

389
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,320
杀人  夺走他们的孩子
Kill people, take their children,

390
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,730
你冒着他们向上帝求助的风险
you run the risk of them turning to God.

391
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,990
-我不信上帝  -那也是个好事
- I don't believe in God. - And a good thing, too.

392
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,120
但若人们遭受太多不幸  就会向上帝求助
But if give people too much tragedy, they'll turn to Him.

393
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,870
你想让他们一直担忧  无束缚
You want to keep them nervous, unbound,

394
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,820
专注于世界上所有
focusing on all the bad things

395
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,930
不幸的事
in the world.

396
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,790
浏览负面消息
Doomscrolling.

397
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,620
聚焦邪恶
Where the focus is evil,

398
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,240
而非美好
and not good.

399
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,350
我每天会给你一个任务
Every day I'm gonna bring you a mission.

400
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,780
你会想质疑这些任务
You're gonna want to question these missions.

401
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,490
但你不能
But you can't.

402
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,920
也不会
You won't.

403
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,950
因为这就是你的工作
It's your job.

404
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,620
做吧
Do it.

405
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,370
难道我们不该等等看有没有闪电吗
Shouldn't we wait for lightning?

406
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,960
这还不够恐怖
It's not quite spooky enough.

407
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,550
我说我们明天早上再来
I said that we'd come back tomorrow morning,

408
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,290
但神父不同意
but Father overruled me.

409
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,910
-我还有弥撒  -那我们的想法是
- I have mass. - So, what are we thinking?

410
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,150
这是一栋待售的废弃房子
Uh, it's an abandoned house up for resale.

411
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,480
打扮成恶魔的孩子们闯入了
Kids broke into it with a demon costume.

412
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,400
-为什么  -为了博眼球
- Why? - To clout chase.

413
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,280
他们肯定知道
They had to know

414
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,550
街景摄像机
that the street view camera

415
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,230
正好在...
was coming by exactly at the...

416
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,350
楼上有什么东西
There's something up there.

417
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,820
-现在吗  -是的
- Now? - Yeah.

418
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,320
我什么都没看见
I don't see anything.

419
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,390
你去哪
Where you going?

420
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,090
我要去确认一下
I'm gonna go check it out.

421
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,590
{\an8}一个朋友

422
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,570
抱歉  我要先接一下电话
I'm sorry, I-I have to take this.

我没了奖学金  负担不起住宿舍的钱
I lost my scholarship and I can't afford the dorms.

460
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,400
好吧  有人在窗户边看到了你
Yeah, well, someone saw you in the window,

461
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,640
然后他们认为你是"来访杰克"
and then they thought you were Visiting Jack.

462
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,760
你也见到他了吗

不  那是"来访杰克"

不  我只听过他的声音

469
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,560
我让这里保持黑暗  因为他喜欢黑暗

对  但是他让我写下来的

474
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,070
胡扯  你就是"来访杰克"

- I'm not. - You know, someone committed suicide

476
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,350

481
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,600
-什么  -小声点

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,870
这个嘛
Well...

565
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,620
我需要把生意卖的价格更高些
I need more money for the business.

566
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,910
-我们说好了是八万五  -不
- We decided on $85,000. - No.

567
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,410
我们说的是这是个协商的起点
We decided that was a good starting point for negotiation.

568
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,160
我至少需要十一万
I'm gonna need $110,000 at least.

569
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,200
如果我告诉你
Well, what if I told you...

570
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,580
有人想一次性付钱买下
that there's somebody who wanted to pay

571
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,080
你的所有生意呢
full freight for the business?

572
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,290
是多少钱
What is full freight?

573
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,080
八十万
$800,000.

574
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,200
-开玩笑吧  -不是
- You're kidding. - No.

575
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,700
他们为什么要花这么多钱
Why would they pay that?

576
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,370
这个...这是新经济
That... it's the new economy.

577
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,160
-什么  -好吧  有些亿万富翁
- What? - Okay, some billionaire

578
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,660
想把我们的买卖规模化
wants to scale our business.

579
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,160
就是那种会买宇宙飞船的亿万富翁
It's like those spaceship billionaires.

580
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,490
这些日子所有人都喜欢冒险
Everybody's into adventure these days.

581
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,290
-谁  那人是谁  -一个风投者
- Who? Who is this person? - Some VC.

582
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,870
他想见你  他有一些问题
He-he wants to meet you. He's got some questions.

583
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,080
我现在突然很想知道
I have the sudden urge to bow.

584
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,870
阿科斯塔神父
Father Acosta.

585
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,990
很抱歉昨晚我抛下了你们
I'm sorry I abandoned you guys yesterday.

586
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,910
-有人快死了吗  -不是  只是工作
- Was somebody dying? - No. Just the job.

587
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,950
看起来你们解决了
So... sounded like you guys solved it.

588
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,490
对  但又遇到了新问题
Yeah, but then we ran into a snag.

589
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,250
嗯
Yeah.

590
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,740
这些好吓人
Yeah, these are pretty spooky.

591
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,740
我们还发现了其他东西
Yeah, so we just discovered something else.

592
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,950
我们只查了四栋房子  但目前为止
Yeah, we're only four houses in, but, so far,

593
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,830
这四栋房子都与凶案有关
these four are all connected to a murder.

594
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,330
或自杀  这对夫妇
Or suicide. This was a couple

595
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,540
在入室抢劫中被杀
that was, uh, killed in a home invasion.

596
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,910
这是纵火  三人死亡
This is arson-- three dead.

597
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,870
自杀  两人上吊
Suicide. Two hangings.

598
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,080
所以这些孩子故意挑选了这些
So the kids that did this just cherry-picked the houses

599
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,620
与暴力死亡有关的房子
that had violent deaths to make it look

600
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,160
让一切看上去像"来访杰克"干的
like Visiting Jack was culpable.

601
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,410
有可能  但问题还是
Yeah, probably, but the question remains...

602
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,040
他们是如何把"来访杰克"
how did they put Visiting Jack in each

603
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,790
嵌入这些街景图片中的
of these street-view pictures?

604
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,580
-看这张图片  -这怎么了
- How about this one? - What about it?

605
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,910
很难看到房子
Kind of hard to see the house.

606
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,200
对  但有人在车道上  你看
Yeah, but there's someone in the driveway. Look.

607
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,700
或许我们该问问她看到了什么
Maybe we should ask her what she saw.

608
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,120
好
Okay.

609
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,950
所以地址是...
So the address is...

610
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,250
在弗罗斯特大街
on Frost.

611
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,370
-怎么了  -那里几个月前发生了凶案
- What? - The violent crime occurred a few months ago.

612
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,950
-是...  -奥森·勒鲁
- It was... - Orson LeRoux.

613
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,790
是  没错
Yeah, it was, uh...

614
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,750
他在那里被杀的
where he was killed.

615
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,660
那我们去看别处的房子
Well, we should look at the other houses.

616
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,910
图片中是埃米莉  他的遗孀
This is Emily in the picture. It's his widow.

617
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,660
她继承了房子  我们可以去找她聊聊
She inherited the house. We should go talk to her.

618
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,120
-我们去就行  克里斯汀  -我们去  你不用...
- We can do that, Kristen... - We can do... You don't ha...

619
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,450
没事  我们走吧
No. Let's go.

620
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,700
{\an8}来访杰克的七大任务

2.摧毁一件圣物
3.打老师脸一拳
4.与处子做爱

621
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,290
你是要拍一些照片还是干其他的...
I mean, do you have to take a picture or something...

622
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,450

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,660
-去完成这些任务  -周一之前
- like, done with it, like...? - Uh, until Monday.

624
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,450
你真觉得自己不做就会死吗
And you do you really think you'll be dead if you don't?

625
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,120
不  我就觉得这是个挑战
No, I just think it's a challenge,

626
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,870
做了总比不做好
so it's better to do it than not.

627
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,660
那放学后就去教堂
Then go to the church after school.

628
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,950
然后大喊"柯克船长是耶稣"吗
And shout "Captain Kirk is Christ"?

629
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,410
他们会认出我的
They'll know it's me.

630
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,200
那就去难看一些的基督教堂
Just, like, go to the Christian church, the ugly one.

631
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,700
也没说必须是天主教堂
They never said it had to be Catholic.

632
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,330
其他任务是什么
What are the other tasks?

我要打一名老师
I have to hit a teacher.

635
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,950
-如果这是个玩笑呢  -你什么意思
- What if it's a joke? - What do you mean?

636
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,700
用这个打老师
Hit a teacher with this.

637
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,080
你就像这样打一拳...
You just, like, punch...

638
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,830
对  打年长的老师然后哈哈大笑
Oh, yeah, hit the old one and then laugh.

639
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,660
-就会像在开玩笑  -我能看下任务清单吗
- It'll be like a joke. - Can I see the list?

640
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,740
-不行  -为什么
- No, no, no, no. - Why?

641
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,240
有些少儿不宜
They're not all for kids.

642
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,370
比如呢
Like what?

643
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,120
比如  我要从爸妈那里偷酒喝掉
Like, I have to steal alcohol from Mom and Dad and drink it.

644
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,620
没有那么少儿不宜啊
That's not so bad.

645
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,950
少一瓶玛格丽特妈妈不会发现  走吧  行动
Mom won't miss a margarita. Come on, let's go.

646
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,870

- I mean, if it's that easy... - Come on, let's go, Lynn.

647

他迟到了
He's late.

648
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,620
他有八十万美金  有迟到的资本
He has $800,000. He can afford to be late.

649
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,990
-别别别  孩子们  -你们非要下来不可吗
- Hey, no, no, no, no. Guys. - Do you have to be here?

650

我们要拿牛奶  拜托

好  快点  去楼上喝
Okay, real quick, but drink it upstairs. Okay.

652
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,830
不行  爸爸  妈妈说
No, Dad, Mom says

653
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,910
-不准在楼上喝东西  -他来了
- no drinks upstairs. - He's coming on!

654
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,620

655
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,830
好  你们待在厨房  安静点
Okay, stay in there. Just be quiet.

-琳  喝吧  -我给你打开
- Lynn, just do it. - I'll open it for you.

659
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
不用  我来开
No, I got it.

660
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,910
快  像妈妈一样一口气喝光
Come on, chug it like Mom.

661
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,370
她不会发现的
She won't even notice it.

662
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,290
好
Okay.

663
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,540
-你喝了  -天啊
- You're doing it. - Oh, my gosh.

664
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,830
真是疯了
You're crazy.

665
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,660
-你竟然真喝了  -天啊
- I can't believe you did it. - Oh, my God.

666
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,040
你做到了
You did it!

667
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,740
抱歉  埃迪  我没听清
sorry, Eddie, I didn't quite catch that.

668
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,370
我说  在我其他的生意中
I said, in my other businesses,

669
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,830
有一点很关键
there has always been one key.

670
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,910
跟着创始人亲身实践学习
To learn hands-on from the originator.

671
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,790
抱歉  我没太明白
I'm sorry, I don't quite follow.

672
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,990
我要你和我一起去尼泊尔
I need you to go with me to Nepal.

673
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,950
把你的生意详尽地讲给我
Show me the ins and outs of your business.

674
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,120
先生  巴什可以与您同去
Oh, sir, no, um, Bash can do that.

675
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,080
我不会再去尼泊尔了
I have taken my last trip to Nepal.

676
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,200
为什么  我不该投资尼泊尔吗
Why? Why, should I not be investing in Nepal?

677
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,910
不是  我已经成家了  先生
No, no. It's just that I have a family, sir.

678
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:22,370
而且...很久没陪家人了
And, um... I've already been away for so long.

679
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,490
尽管我非常理解  先生
Well, as much as I sympathize, sir.

680
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,080
但我要出八十万美金
I am offering to buy your business

681
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,290
收购你的公司
for $800,000.

682

-你带我去熟悉一下  -先生  恕我直言
- to show me the ropes. - Uh, sir, with respect,

684
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,450
巴什能带您去
Bash can do that

685
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,790
跟我和您去没差别
just as well as I can.

686
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,370
是这样  安迪
Here is the thing, Andy.

687
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,450
当我心有所属
When I know what I want,

688
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,160
就势在必得  所以...
I know what I want, so...

689
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,200
我愿意在
I am willing to pay you

690
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,410
付你八十万的基础上
a $150,000 surcharge

691
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,410
再加十五万美金作为你的服务费
on top of my $800,000 for your services.

692
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,140
不是付给巴什
Not Bash's services.

693
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,290
是作为你带我去尼泊尔的酬劳
Your services to guide me to Nepal.

694
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,790
这是我的底线了
And that is my bottom line.

695
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,700
先生
Uh, sir?

696
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,160
埃迪  我能...
Eddie, can I...?

697
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,240
我能...一会给您回电吗
Can I call... Let me call you back.

698
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,370
我要和我的日子商量下...
I just need to check in with my, uh, my life...

699
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,700
和我妻子商量下
with my wife.

700
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,750
当然  但明日要给我答复
Certainly, but I need to know by tomorrow,

701
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,700
否则我就另寻他处了
or I am moving on.

702
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,580
天啊  他真的不想去
Boy, he really doesn't want to go.

703
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,120
对  但是克里斯汀更务实
Yeah, Kristen's the practical one.

704
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,450
她会劝他去的
She'll make him go.

705
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,370
感觉像是和名人同行
It's like being with a celebrity.

706
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,750
对  一个惹人厌的名人
Yeah, a really hated celebrity.

707
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,830
我...
I...

708
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,620
{\an8}一位朋友
来电

709
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,290
我得接个电话
I have to take this.

710
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,580
好  你去吧
Okay, go ahead.

711
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,750
你好
Hello?

712
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,540
你其实不必这么做的
You know, you don't have to do this.

713
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,540
做什么
Do what?

714
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,120
来勒鲁的房子
The LeRoux house.

715
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,870
没事  我很好
Oh, no, I'm good.

716
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,040
他最近神秘兮兮的
He's been very mysterious lately.

717
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,870
是的  他现在可是牧师兄弟会的人
Yeah, he's in the priest frat now.

718
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,990
你俩之间没什么问题吧
There's nothing weird between the two of you, right?

719
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,870
你什么意思
What do you mean?

720
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,620
自从他成为一位牧师之后
Well, just, since he became a priest,

721
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,290
你们就...
you have been...

722
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,660
相处得很不自然
awkward around each other.

723
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,870
不  没有  我们没事
No, no, no. We-We're good.

724
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,910
我们只是没什么机会
We, we just haven't had much of a chance

725
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,910
在一起相处  所以...
to spend any time together, so...

726
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,160
珀西瓦尔酒店  2102号房间
Hotel Percival. Room 2102.

727
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,200
-什么时候  -现在
- When? - Now.

728
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,540
我离那里有40分钟路程
I-I'm 40 minutes away.

729
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,080
不  是25分钟  现在就走
No, you're 25. Leave now.

730
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,660
我是就把《圣经》放在房间里吗
And I'm just leaving the Bible in the room?

731
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,950
不  计划有变
No, change of plan.

732
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,200
2102号房间有个人快要死了
There's a man dying in Room 2102.

733
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,830
你说你是迈克尔神父来执行临终宗教仪式
Say you're Father Michael and administer the last rites.

734
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,450
听懂我说的了吗
Did you understand what I said?

735
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,200
为什么由我来执行临终宗教仪式
Why am I administering last rites?

736
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,370
因为他快死了  而且电话打给了你
Because he's dying and you've been called.

737
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,580
执行结束后  你要在房间里
After you're done, you'll find a postcard

738
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,120
找到一张明信片
somewhere in the room.

739
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,240
带上它离开
Take it and leave.

740
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,250
但要确保你离开时门开着
But make sure you leave the door open.

741
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,040
大卫
David?

742
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,330
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

743
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,790
你需要我重复某个部分吗
Do you need me to repeat any part of it?

744
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,750
我没听到那句拉丁语
I didn't hear the Latin.

745
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,660
主之意志
Is est a Deo habetur.

746
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,330
20分钟
20 minutes.

747
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,000
好了  你准备好去看看了吗
Okay, you ready to go?

748
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,370
实际上  我得去忙了
Actually, I've just gotten called away.

749
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,750
什么  现在吗
What? Now?

750
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,370
是的
Yes.

751
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,450
去哪
Where?

752
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,330
说来话长
It's a long story.

753
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,830
我晚点找你们吧
I'll talk to you two later?

754
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,870
有事不对劲
Uh, something is up.

755
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,790
没错
Yep.

756
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,120
好吧
Okay.

757
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,790
准备好了吗
Ready?

758
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,080
好了
Yeah.

759
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,950
再次见到你很高兴  克里斯汀
It's good to see you again, Kristen.

760
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,740
生活不容易
It's been hard.

761
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,580
我了解
I know.

762
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,160
我听说你有新欢了
I heard you met someone.

763
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,870
一位非常可爱的人
A very sweet man.

764
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,200
他让我更容易回到这里
He made it easier coming back here.

765
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,660
这里是...
This is...

766
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,250
奥森遇害的地方...
where Orson was when he...

767
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,990
起初警方认为是我干的
At first the police thought that I did it.

768
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,160
我听说了
I heard about that.

769
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,540
他们至今没有弄清楚到底发生了什么
They still haven't figured out what's happened.

770
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,740
你看过你家的那个街景吗  勒鲁太太
Have you seen the street view of your house, Ms. LeRoux?

771
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,620
什么东西
The what?

772
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,830
对  我听说过这个
Oh, yeah, I heard about this.

773
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,990
一个鬼魂  是吗
A ghost, right?

774
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,250
是的  那么...
Yeah, so, uh...

775
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,160
我们认为那个下车的人是你
we think that that's you there, getting out of your car.

776
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,950
我们想知道你是不是看到了什么人
We just wondered if you saw someone

777
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,910
装扮成那样  或者...
in a costume or...

778
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,450
有人故意拍这种照片吗
someone setting up this shot?

779
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,830
这个鬼魂照吗
This ghost shot?

780
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,040
没有
No.

781
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,830
但是有些怪事
There was something weird, though.

782
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,790
那个司机  街景里面的司机
The driver-- the street view driver--

783
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,950
他们的车很奇怪  车顶有相机
their car is so weird, with the camera on the roof.

784
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,120
开车经过那幢房子三次
Drove past the house three times.

785
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,160
倒回去  再开
Back up, do it again.

786
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,250
你知道原因吗
Do you know why?

787
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,790
不知道  不清楚
No, I have no idea.

788
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,870
我们怎么看
What are we thinking?

789
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,790
我认为有人和街景司机协同工作
I'm thinking somebody is working with the street view driver.

790
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,660
这样一来  他们知道那辆车要来了
That is how they knew that the car was coming.

791
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,160
七个住所都是吗
With all seven residences?

792
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,830
-对  -那我们怎么找出
- Yeah. - So how do we find out

793
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,120
这个街景司机是谁呢
who this street view driver was?

794
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,330
看这个
Watch this.

795
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,910
就是他
There he is.

798
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,040
{\an2}你怎么还不明白

799
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,360
{\an2}他马上就快死了

800
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,850
{\an2}不  我不知道出了什么事

801
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,870
{\an2}他一下子就躺倒了

802
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,950
我是来这执行临终宗教仪式的
I'm here to administer the last rites.

803
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,790
{\an2}我不管你听到了什么

804
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,580
{\an2}他在飞机上还好好的

805
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,540
{\an2}出事了  但我不知道究竟是怎么回事

806
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,660
借此神圣膏油  愿主
With this holy anointing, may the Lord

807
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,160
以祂的爱与仁慈...

主以祂的爱与仁慈
...Lord in His love and mercy...

810
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,410
以圣神的恩宠助佑你
...help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit.

811
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,040
愿主赦免你的罪
May the Lord who frees you from sin

812
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,000
救赎你
save you

813
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,870
把你举高
and raise you up.

814
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,490
{\an2}-不  不  亲爱的  -他死了

815
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,640
{\an2}不要离开我们

816
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,230
{\an2}你不能就这么走了

May-may I help you with anything else?

819
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,230
{\an2}先生  先生

820
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,790

No, no.

821
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,250
进展如何
So, how'd it go?

822
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,910
嗯...
Well, um...

823
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,990
本发现那个出现在
Ben figured out that the street view driver was

824
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,990
七处恶魔住宅的街景司机
the same person at all seven houses

825
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,290
是同一个人  这家伙和我们
where this demon appeared, and the guy goes

826
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:46,540
找到的菲比斯上同一所学校  非全日制
to school part-time with the kid Phoebus that we found.

827
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:49,580
所以...他们是窜通好的
So... they concocted it together.

828
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,540
所以这是一个骗局
So it was a scam.

829
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,120
没错  社交媒体
Yep, social media

830
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,580
让动机变得又简单又愚蠢
makes motives both simpler and stupider.

831
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,370
那你的说来话长的事怎么样了
So, how'd your, uh, long story go?

832

-我的...  -你说的那是...
- My...? - Oh, you said it was a...

总是必须要立刻解决
It always has to be solved, like, right then.

836
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,500
我怀念我们
I miss us.

837
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,450
这与我们无关
I-It had nothing to do with us.

838
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,830
我知道  但我们不再是从前的我们了
I know, but we're not what we were,

839
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:32,500
我觉得我...
and, and I think that I...

840
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,120
我觉得...
I think...

841
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,790
-我觉得是我造成的  -不是
- I think I caused that... - No.

842
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,490
当我找你忏悔时
...when I confessed to you

843
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,910
-然后之后的事  -克里斯汀
- and then afterwards. - Kristen,

844
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,540
没事
it's okay.

845
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,580
已经过去了
It's done.

846
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,080
显然没过去  因为如果过去了
Well, clearly it's not done, 'cause if it were done,

847
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,950
你依然会是我朋友  然而...
I'd still have a friend, and...

848
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,580
我能感觉到我不是
I can feel that I don't.

849
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:04,660
克里斯汀
Kristen,

850
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,200
我身上发生的事
what's going on with me

851
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,330
和我的...
has nothing to do with my...

852
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,830
我们的...
...with our...

853
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,620
和我们彼此的感情无关
Feelings toward each other?

854
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,200
对
Yes.

855
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:21,000
和我是牧师有关
It's to do with me being a priest.

856
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,660
一位新晋牧师
A new priest.

857
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,200
仅此而已
That's all.

858
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,370
我感觉很孤独
I feel lonely.

859
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,040
别这样
Don't be.

860
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:35,950
我在这里
I'm here.

861
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,620
我会重新做回自己
And I'll be myself again.

862
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,500
那就好
I'd like that.

863
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,120
我也觉得那挺好
I'd like that, too.

864
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:46,700
太好了
Great.

865
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,580
我们又是朋友了
Friends again.

866
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,580
明天见
I will see you tomorrow.

867
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,200
你回来迟了
You're late.

868
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,660
我不知道我还有时间限制
I didn't know I was on a schedule.

869
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,290
这是神圣的天主教堂
This is the holy Catholic Church.

870
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,120
你永远有时间限制
You're always on a schedule.

871
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,330
明信片呢
The postcard?

872
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,410
怎么了
What?

873
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,620
这是怎么回事
What was that?

874
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,750
什么怎么回事
What was what?

875
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,750
用圣事来掩盖你的间谍活动
Using the sacraments to cover your little espionage.

876
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:38,080
作为牧师  这是我第一次觉得自己像个骗子
This is the first time I felt like a fraud being a priest.

877
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,790
你当八天牧师以来的第一次吗
The first time in your eight days as a priest?

878
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,040
我的天啊
Oh, my goodness.

879
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,080
我在那里做什么
What was I doing there?

880
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,120
临终圣礼是你主持的吗
Did you administer the last rites?

881
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:46,950
是的
Yes.

882
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,740
只有这样我才能偷到这个
But only so I could steal this.

883
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,330
那个人要死了
That man was dying.

884
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,160
他为什么会死
Why was he dying?

885
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,370
大卫  你答应过梵蒂冈
David, you said yes to the Vatican.

886
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,450
-这份承诺会有负担  -不
- That yes came with a burden. - No.

887
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
他为什么会死
Why was he dying?

888
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,870
他被下毒了
He was poisoned.

889
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:06,830
为什么
Why?

890
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,370
有人企图阻止他
There was someone trying to prevent him

891
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,040
传递消息  那个消息
from delivering a message. That message.

892
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,620
这怎么能对抗魔鬼
How is this battling evil?

893
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,620
这一切在我看来无比邪恶
This all seems evil to me.

894
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,250
大卫
David...

895
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,540
作为评估员  在工作中
In your work as an assessor,

896
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,200
你必须发现两种来源的魔鬼
you must have found two sources of evil.

897
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,370
超自然和人类
The supernatural and the human.

898
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:29,620
我和人类打交道
I deal with the human.

899
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,990
行坏事的恶人
Bad people doing bad things.

900
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,620
邪恶的政府  杀人犯  刑讯者
Evil governments. Murderers. Torturers.

901
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,870
他们存在于这个世界  必须阻止他们
They exist in the world, and they must be stopped,

902
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,830
他们可能比恶魔还要多
maybe even more than demons.

903
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,790
这就是我需要那张明信片的原因
So that is why I need that postcard.

904
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,330
用来杀死另一位送信人吗
To kill another messenger?

905
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,120
不  为了救一个人
No. To save one.

906
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,290
谁
Who?

907
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,950
你想要这张明信片
You want this postcard,

908
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,790
我想知道我在救谁
I want to know who I'm saving.

909
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,200
格蕾丝·林
Grace Ling.

910
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:08,330
你认识她
You know her.

911
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,080
是你让我们注意到她的
You brought her to our attention.

912
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,200
梵蒂冈相信她是先知
The Vatican believes she is a prophet.

913
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,160
她被遣返回中国
She was deported back to China

914
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,620
在某个劳教所失踪
and lost in a work camp.

915
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,200
我们相信已找到她的位置
We believe we have located her,

916
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,830
那张明信片会告诉我们
and that postcard will tell us

917
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,910
是否有机会救回她
if there is a chance to recover her.

918
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,450
{\an8}纽约
自由女神像

919
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:33,580
{\an8}明信片

920
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,410
他们还给你其它什么了吗
Were you given anything else?

921
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,080
-没有  -你确定吗
- No. - Are you sure?

922
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:43,750
这个
This.

923
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,620
是小费
As a tip.

924
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,870
{\an8}她在营地  周五离

925

保持联系
We'll be in touch.

927
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,700
你爸说你喝了我一罐玛格丽特酒
Dad said you drank one of my margaritas.

928
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,160
我不希望你这样做
I don't want you doing that.

929
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,160
对不起
I'm sorry.

930
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,950
我看了那七个任务
I read the seven tasks.

931
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,790
"来访杰克"的任务
The Visiting Jack tasks.

932
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,200
我知道这是任务之一
I know it's one of them.

933
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,910
我不再相信那个了
I don't believe in that anymore.

934
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,950
任务四是"与处子做爱"
Task number four was "have sex with a virgin."

935
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,370
我还没到那一步  妈
I didn't get that far, Mom.

936
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:40,700
那雷呢
Did Ren?

937
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,620
我们没做爱
We didn't have sex.

938
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,370
没有
We didn't.

939
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,580
我想相信你  琳
I want to believe you, Lynn.

940
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,660
但你不能骗我
But you cannot lie to me.

941
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,500
我不会的
I won't.

942
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,290
是马桶的声音
That's the toilet.

943
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,620
我去处理
I'll get on it.

944
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,290
你考虑过吗
Have you thought about it?

945
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,910
然后呢
And?

946
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,660
这是你最后一次徒步旅行吗
This is your last trek?

947
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:33,620
是的
Yeah.

948
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,410
要去多久
And for how long?

949
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,620
三个月
Three months.

950
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,450
天啊
Oh, boy.

951
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,830
好吧
Well,

952
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,370
这确实是一大笔钱  而且
it's an insane amount of money, and...

953
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:50,250
我们需要用钱  所以我不...
...we need money, so I don't...

954
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,200
不知道我们该怎样拒绝
I don't really see how we can say no.

955
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,910
-我不想去  -我知道你不想
- I don't want to go. - I know you don't.

956
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,540
别死了
Just don't die.

957
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:03,870
好的
Okay.

958
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,620
预支一半的钱
And get half the money up front.

959
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,790
我们必须开始建那个卫生间
We have to start on that bathroom.

960
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:10,540
我会的
I will.

961
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,160
我非常爱你
I love you so much.

962
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,040
我也是
I love you, too.

963
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,790
做单亲妈妈实在太糟糕了
Being a single mom just really sucks.

964
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,200
我知道  我都知道
I know. I know.

965
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:26,910
就快结束了
It's almost over.

966
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,750
