1
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:12,153
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> The Serpent Queen...

2
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,595
Does Mary have a claim
to the throne?

3
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:16,197
<i>Fifteen years had passed.</i>

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,598
<i>Mary had been with us</i>
<i>on account</i>

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,761
<i>of her betrothal</i>
<i>to our eldest son.</i>

6
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:21,843
<i>Ruggieri had disappeared</i>
<i>from my life.</i>

7
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:24,686
<i>Montmorency had not been seen</i>
<i>for many years.</i>

8
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:25,807
You know Antoinette of Guise?

9
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:27,128
<i>She's returned to the courts</i>

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,491
<i>since the untimely death</i>
<i>of her husband.</i>

11
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:31,012
<i>My dear cousins have taken</i>

12
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:33,094
<i>to seizing the homes</i>
<i>of prominent Protestants.</i>

13
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:35,817
<i>Colonel Guise has now claimed</i>
<i>Chenonceau for himself.</i>

14
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,900
Surely we could discover
some utility in each other.

15
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:40,302
<i>Thought you two</i>
<i>were done with each other.</i>

16
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:42,184
Gold can poison the mind,

17
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:44,546
<i>but just enough</i>
<i>will preserve your youth.</i>

18
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,028
When you are king,

19
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,390
<i>you will put Catherine</i>
<i>on your Privy Council.</i>

20
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:50,392
Lead a garrison of men
to the border.

21
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:51,794
Will that suffice?

22
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:53,435
<i>I give you your king.</i>

23
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:55,277
You have a message
from the Holy Roman emperor.

24
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:31,957
You're quiet today.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,322
The letter you saw me receive
last night contains evidence

26
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,965
that Queen Mary
is conspiring with her cousin,

27
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:44,128
Queen Elizabeth of England,
against me.

28
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,850
But I thought
they hated each other.

29
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:47,572
Well, apparently,
the only thing they hate

30
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:50,294
more than each other
is the thought of me,

31
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,500
<i>a commoner,</i>
<i>on a throne of Europe.</i>

32
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,981
There may be
more correspondence

33
00:01:57,023 --> 00:01:59,784
hidden within Mary's rooms.

34
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:03,070
I would search for them myself,
but it would raise suspicion.

35
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:07,714
Perhaps you could help me.

36
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:12,117
You want me to search
Mary's rooms for you?

37
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,962
I would not ask if the
situation were not so grave.

38
00:02:19,527 --> 00:02:21,529
There's a man watching us.

39
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:24,570
Where?

40
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,614
There, in the trees.

41
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:29,135
I don't see anyone.

42
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:31,179
<i>No, I'm sure I saw him.</i>

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,221
The forest
is full of creatures.

44
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:37,265
Perhaps you mistook one.

45
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:42,630
All I ask is that
you consider my request.

46
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:46,713
The fate of the country
hangs in the balance,

47
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:48,475
not to mention my own.

48
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:50,519
And yours.

49
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,999
Our fates are intertwined.

50
00:02:57,966 --> 00:03:01,090
Now,
should I continue my story?

51
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:04,852
<i>Though the death</i>
<i>of King Francis</i>

52
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,896
<i>had made me queen,</i>

53
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,418
<i>it was in name only.</i>

54
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:17,507
Your Majesty, would you like me
to have breakfast brought?

55
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:23,833
Are you all right?

56
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:27,635
See this?

57
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:30,798
It's a pair of Cs,
for Catherine.

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,563
<i>With an H overlaid for Henry.</i>

59
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,166
It's romantic, no?

60
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:40,528
But if you look at it this way,

61
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,696
the Cs become a D, for Diane.

62
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:55,704
I would not be so disrespected
if Ruggieri were here.

63
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:57,706
<i>He's the only one,</i>

64
00:03:57,748 --> 00:04:00,189
the only one
who never underestimated me.

65
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:02,431
Because he tells you
what you want to hear.

66
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:04,714
It's his only real talent.

67
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,960
Perhaps.

68
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:16,007
And perhaps I became pregnant
by some coincidence.

69
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:20,530
And perhaps you lost yours
the same way.

70
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:22,052
It doesn't matter.

71
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:24,214
That man asks too much
for what he gives in return.

72
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:26,258
Not if it's worth it.

73
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:35,387
I'd like to be alone
with the queen.

74
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:58,689
Turns out you were right
about the Holy Roman emperor.

75
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,935
The garrison wasn't enough
to dissuade his aggression.

76
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:05,218
You were right about that too.

77
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,581
I will ride out at the head
of my troops

78
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,625
tomorrow morning.

79
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,868
May God protect you.

80
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,231
I'll need someone to run things
while I'm away.

81
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:21,633
Wouldn't require much, just...

82
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:23,876
someone to keep an eye
on the functions of government,

83
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,760
so I've decided
to make you regent.

84
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:32,044
But Antoine of Bourbon
is rightfully regent.

85
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:35,047
Mm. If you follow
the rules of succession, yes,

86
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:37,091
<i>but I'd rather it was you.</i>

87
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:41,334
<i>And I have the power</i>
<i>to make these decisions, so...</i>

88
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,938
you will have the highest
authority in the land.

89
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:46,861
Just till I'm back.

90
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,585
Because I know I can trust you.

91
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:00,754
He was right.

92
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:02,798
He could trust me to be regent.

93
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,842
Even if he couldn't love me
as a wife.

94
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,170
You asked for me, madam?

95
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:17,451
I need more.

96
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:19,495
As you wish.

97
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:31,145
Leave the bottle.

98
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:33,668
I told you, too much
can drive a person mad.

99
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,670
Made my father
do unspeakable things.

100
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:36,751
To you?

101
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:39,113
Till I made him stop, that is.

102
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:41,156
You know how to look
after yourself.

103
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:42,637
I admire that.

104
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:44,399
Yes, and that's why
I have to stop coming here.

105
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:45,680
<i>Oh?</i>

106
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:47,282
The Queen might discover
our relationship.

107
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,084
Her punishment would be severe.

108
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:51,128
Mm.

109
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,649
You must pick a horse.

110
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,490
There can only be one winner.

111
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:57,132
I did not make the rules.

112
00:06:57,174 --> 00:06:59,296
In fact, I despise them.

113
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:01,979
But they are what they are.

114
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:06,061
Nothing personal.

115
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,827
Twice a day, no more.

116
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:13,189
Hmm.

117
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,151
I'm very grateful.

118
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:16,552
<i>I will need more gold</i>

119
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:18,154
<i>if I am</i>
<i>to continue supplying you.</i>

120
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:20,438
I can get you more
whenever you need.

121
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:26,843
Together, we could accomplish
great things, Angelica.

122
00:07:48,908 --> 00:07:51,350
Thank you for agreeing
to be regent.

123
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:57,314
Yes, very good of you
to, uh...step in.

124
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,003
Come back to us.

125
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,287
I'll do my utmost.

126
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:18,777
I want you
to put aside your differences

127
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:22,100
and I want you to serve your
regent while I am at war, yes?

128
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:24,825
We remain
your faithful servants.

129
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:27,225
Good.

130
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:28,667
- Cunt.
- Cock.

131
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,148
- Kiddie-fiddler.
- Pig-fucker.

132
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,150
Oh, grow up.

133
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:33,194
Thank you.

134
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:38,517
It'll be you going to war next.

135
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,800
M-Ma-Mary says
I should focus on my strengths.

136
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:43,042
And what does Mary say
that those are?

137
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:44,684
The-the study of scriptures.

138
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:49,208
Mm. Like most who suffer
from physical afflictions,

139
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,891
Francis is very close to God.

140
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:55,455
What others see as weakness,
I see only as strength.

141
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,499
Your Majesty.

142
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,903
Well, that can be no bad thing.

143
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:08,030
Show our enemies no mercy,
Father.

144
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:14,076
We will pray for you.

145
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,522
Ah.

146
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:33,014
Diane, what are you doing?

147
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:35,776
I have decided I shall
accompany you to the front

148
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:37,578
and bring you luck.

149
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,579
Diane--

150
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,702
I can outride most of your men.

151
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:43,426
Would you have me sit and pine
when I can be useful?

152
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,469
I only hope
the Duke of Guise can keep up.

153
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,513
I certainly intend to try.

154
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:55,239
Very well.

155
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,760
Can I ask you something,
brother?

156
00:09:58,802 --> 00:09:59,921
Of course, brother.

157
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:01,283
Why the fuck did you agree

158
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,085
to surrender your regency
to Catherine

159
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:04,646
while the king is away?

160
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,849
Well, the king asked me.

161
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:08,010
What was I supposed to do?

162
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:10,054
You were supposed to say no.

163
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:13,856
<i>I didn't care</i>
<i>that my husband took Diane</i>

164
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:15,418
<i>to battle with him.</i>

165
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,421
<i>With any luck,</i>
<i>they would be captured,</i>

166
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:22,144
<i>held for ransom</i>
<i>that I would be slow to pay.</i>

167
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:25,750
<i>All that mattered was that</i>
<i>it was my time to govern.</i>

168
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:31,116
Regent of all France.

169
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:34,039
Not bad for a commoner.

170
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,405
Look, the Holy Roman emperor,

171
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:44,808
<i>his battalion</i>
<i>is much larger than ours.</i>

172
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,050
Our only advantage
is geography.

173
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:48,852
We should take them by
surprise, approach from

174
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,294
-the ridge before daybreak...
-Yeah?

175
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:51,735
And drive them into the forest.

176
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,977
Yes, they wouldn't expect it.

177
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,341
If you were to send
half your men on foot

178
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:59,063
into the dark of the forest

179
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:02,026
and then make the approach
from above a feint,

180
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:03,788
<i>they would still react</i>
<i>as if it's not</i>

181
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,112
and they would
do as you say, no?

182
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:10,755
Yes, if our riders made a hell
of a noise on the way down,

183
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:14,118
then there they would meet our
men in ditches that we've dug.

184
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,241
Waiting to cut the enemy
to pieces.

185
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:18,203
Exactly.

186
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,445
Just like madam said.

187
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:22,167
Excellent plan, Your Majesty.

188
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,848
Montmorency would be proud.

189
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,371
<i>Yeah, well, it's</i>
<i>what he taught us, isn't it?</i>

190
00:11:26,413 --> 00:11:29,014
Anticipate an enemy's reaction
and use it.

191
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,936
Mm.

192
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:32,978
Didn't think
you were paying attention.

193
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,022
Always.

194
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:40,986
Are you the queen's dressmaker?

195
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:42,908
What's it to you?

196
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,989
I'm hungry.

197
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,391
So go to the kitchen.

198
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,433
I worked as an apprentice
for a dressmaker.

199
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:49,597
Perhaps I could work for you.

200
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:52,638
All I want is a place to sleep.

201
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,722
I don't need any help.

202
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:57,205
Now fuck off.

203
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:01,728
Catherine asked for you.

204
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,772
Did she?

205
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:07,694
You're never where you say
you're going to be these days.

206
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:09,776
I've been busy.

207
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:11,658
What's that you've got
in your hand there?

208
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,702
Nothing.

209
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:15,302
Nothing?

210
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:22,151
Show me.

211
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:25,833
It's a present for you,
actually.

212
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,877
Now you've spoiled
the surprise.

213
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:34,922
You told them I requested
a Privy Council meeting?

214
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,444
Of course.

215
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:39,887
Where are you going?

216
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,810
The regent's
called a Privy Council meeting.

217
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:45,173
<i>You mean</i>
<i>the merchant's daughter?</i>

218
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:48,416
A Guise does not come when
called by someone like that.

219
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,618
Or are you her dog?

220
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,420
Okay, Mother.

221
00:12:52,462 --> 00:12:53,982
What would you want me to do?

222
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,064
As I am a member
of the king's Privy Council.

223
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:59,149
Yes, the king's Privy Council.

224
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,872
Make her come to you.

225
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:07,277
Tell her I'm indisposed.

226
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,720
Privy Council meeting.

227
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:13,764
Sit down, Antoine.

228
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:18,087
Is the cardinal going?

229
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:19,208
He has been called.

230
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,569
That doesn't mean he's going.

231
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:22,613
Find out.

232
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:26,255
We're not gonna sit there
like a big pair of tits,

233
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:27,536
waiting for him.

234
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:30,099
No. He'd just love that,
wouldn't he?

235
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,622
Yes, because then
we would look weak,

236
00:13:32,664 --> 00:13:33,943
and we would not get
what we want.

237
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:35,987
Right. Of course.

238
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,831
And-and-and what is it
we want, exactly?

239
00:13:40,672 --> 00:13:42,952
To finish our meal
without being burdened

240
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:45,315
by the whims of someone
who shouldn't be regent.

241
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,359
Right.

242
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,600
It's just that...

243
00:13:50,642 --> 00:13:53,083
well, it-it all seems
a bit pointless

244
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,286
when we might
actually help govern.

245
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:58,969
Pointless or not, it's the
family business, Antoine.

246
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:00,611
If you don't like it,
you can always

247
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:03,055
go and help Father
tend to Mother's gardens.

248
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:23,274
I knew I would be tested,

249
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,559
but I had no idea
it was going to be so soon.

250
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:33,565
Ah, Your Majesty.

251
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,127
<i>Have you, uh,</i>

252
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:37,129
have you come for confession?

253
00:14:37,171 --> 00:14:39,173
I have nothing to confess.

254
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,535
Please.

255
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,781
I missed you
at the Privy Council meeting.

256
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,704
Yes, a member
of my, uh, flock was in need.

257
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:54,066
I've had a message
from the king.

258
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,869
He will need more funds
if he is to keep fighting.

259
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:59,632
I'm afraid you're-you're
showing your inexperience.

260
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:01,994
The Privy Council
can't give you what you need.

261
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:04,038
For that, you have to go
to the treasury.

262
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:08,561
Oh.

263
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,003
Thank you.

264
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:10,924
You will, however,

265
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:12,605
find the treasury empty.

266
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:14,167
Well, how can it be empty?

267
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,729
Your Majesty, have you not seen

268
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:18,812
how these frugal Protestants
spend money?

269
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:21,174
Of course, you could go
to Parlement to request funds,

270
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:22,976
but unfortunately the majority

271
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,898
are not made up
with the nobility or clergy

272
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,660
<i>but of the mercantile class.</i>

273
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:28,542
You should get along
with them well.

274
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:29,983
Meaning?

275
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,027
Just that you are so likable.

276
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:35,551
Not what she meant.

277
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:39,233
So how do you propose
I win their support?

278
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:43,597
The Third Estate is divided
evenly between Catholics,

279
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:46,681
who will always vote
the way I tell them,

280
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:48,883
and members of the new religion
of whom you can expect

281
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:52,166
nothing but backstabbing
and disloyalty.

282
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,730
Can I count on you
for your support?

283
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:58,094
That depends on what
you're willing to do for me.

284
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:02,097
There are certain properties
currently in Protestant hands

285
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,818
that I believe
would be better off

286
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,821
under the curation
of the Catholic Church.

287
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:09,745
Your own brother
is in harm's way,

288
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:11,306
and yet you are haggling.

289
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,669
We don't worry about Francois.

290
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:15,270
Francois
can look after himself.

291
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:16,912
He always has done.
Isn't that right, Mother?

292
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:18,914
I have never condoned
special treatment

293
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:20,235
for either of my boys.

294
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,438
The country must come first.

295
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,560
I admire your patriotism.

296
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:26,202
There is no higher purpose.

297
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:27,603
Except my line.

298
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:29,767
God, of course.

299
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:37,493
I'm willing
to put up the money,

300
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:39,375
but I need protection
from that fucking cardinal

301
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:40,697
and his brother.

302
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:42,338
I'm not building those ships

303
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,901
to have them taken off me
by a grown man in a skirt.

304
00:16:44,943 --> 00:16:47,584
Show me
the, uh, sketches again?

305
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:50,827
<i>Ah.</i>

306
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:53,790
Mm. Yeah.

307
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:56,233
Fascinating.
Isn't it, Antoine?

308
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:57,194
-What?
-These.

309
00:16:57,236 --> 00:16:58,955
Yes, absolutely.

310
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:02,041
And, in return,
what could we expect?

311
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,763
25% of the profits.

312
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,364
-Make it fifty.
-Fifty?

313
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:10,127
You have come to us
for protection.

314
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:12,169
<i>It comes at a cost.</i>

315
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,931
You're just as bad
as the others.

316
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:17,617
<i>Ah, Your Majesty.</i>

317
00:17:19,258 --> 00:17:21,899
Your Majesty,
may I present Pierre Marques.

318
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:22,940
It's an honor.

319
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:25,263
I hope I'm not interrupting.

320
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:28,066
No, actually,
we were just leaving.

321
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:30,110
We'll be in touch.

322
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:33,233
Your Majesty.

323
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:39,117
So, so sorry
we couldn't make it

324
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,879
to the Privy Council meeting.

325
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:44,603
There's just...so much
going on at the moment.

326
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:46,525
-Right, Antoine?
-Hmm?

327
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,288
Uh, yes, of course.
It's-it's exhausting, really.

328
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,130
-Endless. Go, go, go.
-Mm.

329
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:52,571
I presume you know
why I'm here.

330
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,573
The war. I heard.
Terrible business.

331
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,615
Obviously, we'd love to help
rally Protestant support,

332
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:59,418
but more contributions
to the treasury at this point,

333
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,700
<i>well, it's a bitter pill</i>
<i>to swallow.</i>

334
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:04,383
I mean, that man you just met
had his home taken from him

335
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:06,906
for no other reason
than being a Protestant.

336
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:10,990
On the other hand, I may
be able to deliver the votes

337
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:14,434
if you were to make a...
gesture in return.

338
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,876
What sort of gesture?

339
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:20,320
I think having a member
of the Catholic clergy

340
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:22,842
on the Privy Council
is a little...

341
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,205
outdated, don't you?

342
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:27,247
You would have me
remove Cardinal Guise

343
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,568
from the Privy Council?

344
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,609
It would be a start.

345
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,291
Protestants are not interested

346
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,213
in these old grievances
and wars.

347
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:36,136
They are for hard work
and making money.

348
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:37,818
<i>As am I.</i>

349
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,862
Are you?

350
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:44,425
Trading on your
inherited status at every turn

351
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:47,148
seems a more accurate
description of your agenda

352
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,229
to me.

353
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,999
Ah, it's a fair point.

354
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:01,442
Drop your cocks,
grab your socks.

355
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:03,124
<i>Time to go</i>
<i>and kill some Spaniards.</i>

356
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,165
Charming.

357
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:09,531
Still raining.

358
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:10,732
Is it now?

359
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,693
<i>We can't wait any longer.</i>

360
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:12,894
Good a day to die as any.

361
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,142
All right.

362
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,423
His Majesty does not
intend to fight, I hope.

363
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:23,145
Of course.
I'm their leader.

364
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:25,307
I will ride into battle
at the head of my men.

365
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:27,429
You're more than that.
You're the king.

366
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:28,871
<i>What will become</i>
<i>of the French people</i>

367
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:30,272
if something happens to you?

368
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:33,836
Diane, my father led
from the front.

369
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:37,840
Forgive me, but your father
was not the intellect you are.

370
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:43,005
I loved him as you did, but...

371
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:45,928
the duke will agree
he was not a strategist.

372
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,770
When he was captured
a-at Pavia,

373
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,133
he left you and your brother
in his stead.

374
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:52,335
Do you think your son
would survive such a fate?

375
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:55,058
I would never, never subject
my son to anything like that.

376
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,299
<i>Of course not.</i>

377
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:57,901
But you said
you wanted to learn

378
00:19:57,943 --> 00:20:00,023
from your father's mistakes.

379
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,146
Bloodying your sword is not
what makes you a great king.

380
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:04,628
Diane.

381
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,590
-War is not a game...
-Diane...

382
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:08,912
in which to prove yourself.

383
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:11,116
Now men's lives are at stake.

384
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:13,477
I don't ask you to think of me.

385
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,639
I don't ask you to think
of what would become of me

386
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,321
if something happens to you.

387
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:20,326
I ask you to think of France.

388
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,731
Francois.

389
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,493
What do you think?

390
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:36,461
I think madam
sees the situation clearly.

391
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:39,426
<i>I shall ride into battle,</i>
<i>carrying your colors proudly.</i>

392
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,079
He thinks I'm a coward!

393
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:56,922
To be a great king,

394
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,605
you must be willing
to make decisions

395
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,649
that are not popular
nor flattering.

396
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:05,611
Francois would never be capable
of such sacrifice.

397
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:07,975
He will never be
a leader of men.

398
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:11,777
Only you have that wisdom.

399
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:26,152
<i>I knew I wouldn't get any help</i>

400
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:28,435
<i>from the Guises</i>
<i>or the Bourbons,</i>

401
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:31,400
<i>so I would have</i>
<i>to find another way.</i>

402
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:36,843
I don't know why I ever agreed
to join Parlement.

403
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:38,887
<i>No good ever comes of it.</i>

404
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:41,290
Well, there's always
a first time, isn't there?

405
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:45,692
From what I understand,
the regent is her own woman.

406
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,737
No one is their own anything.

407
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:50,179
Least of all a woman.

408
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,661
You have done well...

409
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:56,223
displayed a subtlety
of understanding

410
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:59,228
for the whims of court
that were lost on your father.

411
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:03,913
M-mother...

412
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:07,355
...has it ever occurred to you

413
00:22:07,397 --> 00:22:09,677
that your constant
underestimation of the man

414
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:13,441
may have just, you know,
sapped his confidence?

415
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:15,724
And if you just
loved him properly,

416
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:17,606
he-he might've done more.

417
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,167
No.

418
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:20,929
The truth is, he was a dullard.

419
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:22,210
Poor man.

420
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:23,892
You, on the other hand,

421
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:27,736
appear to take after
my side of the family.

422
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:29,780
I'm almost proud of you.

423
00:22:34,065 --> 00:22:36,545
Do you think
she'll really go for it?

424
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:39,268
-What choice does she have?
-She's the queen.

425
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,510
Far as I can tell,
she has infinite choices.

426
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:43,512
Do you really think she wants
to explain to the king

427
00:22:43,554 --> 00:22:46,155
why she failed to send him
what he needed to win?

428
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:48,237
She's already been replaced
in the bedroom.

429
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,919
'Course not.

430
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:51,641
To understand people,

431
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:55,365
you must know their desires
and their fears.

432
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,288
That way
you have leverage, Antoine.

433
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,930
That's how the world works.

434
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:14,306
They're ready for you.

435
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:16,370
I stand before you today

436
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:19,972
because our beloved France

437
00:24:20,014 --> 00:24:22,176
is at war.

438
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,659
At this very moment,

439
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:29,822
King Henri and his soldiers

440
00:24:29,864 --> 00:24:31,744
are risking their lives

441
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:34,109
fighting
for French sovereignty.

442
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:38,231
In order to succeed,

443
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:40,315
they will need food,

444
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:44,237
weapons, horses,

445
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,280
and armor--

446
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:48,524
all of which cost money.

447
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:52,366
To the Catholic members,

448
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,928
let it be known

449
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,414
the Crown has always
appreciated your loyalty.

450
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:01,936
To the Protestant members
of the body,

451
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,418
<i>there is no reason</i>

452
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,303
you should not be free
to prosper.

453
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:10,264
No one should take from you

454
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:13,308
<i>what you alone have built.</i>

455
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,390
<i>In return for your support,</i>

456
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:18,553
a representative
of your choosing

457
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:22,197
will be granted a private
audience with the king,

458
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,838
<i>during which time</i>

459
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,002
<i>you will be free</i>
<i>to air your grievances</i>

460
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:28,603
without middlemen

461
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:32,167
<i>getting in the way for profit.</i>

462
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:34,770
It is the king's desire

463
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:38,373
to make tolerance
the law of the land.

464
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:42,057
This is what resides
in the king's heart.

465
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:43,979
And if you knew him

466
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,424
the way that I know him--

467
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:49,267
his generosity,

468
00:25:49,907 --> 00:25:51,909
his kindness,

469
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,392
his loyalty--

470
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,313
you would have no choice

471
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:00,438
but to answer
your sovereign's call

472
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,239
at France's hour of need.

473
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:27,947
The military shall have
our support, Your Majesty,

474
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:31,789
in return for the king's ear.

475
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:34,031
Oh, fuck.

476
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:46,004
People

477
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:49,409
only ever want to be heard.

478
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,931
She's a natural,
wouldn't you say?

479
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:56,334
She's a fucking problem
is what she is, Antoine.

480
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:59,337
She just won the Protestants'
support without our help

481
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:01,740
and without giving us
anything in return.

482
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:03,784
Do you know what that makes us?

483
00:27:05,346 --> 00:27:06,865
Assholes?

484
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:08,987
Precisely.

485
00:27:31,372 --> 00:27:34,215
-You came home.
-I did, thanks to you.

486
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:37,659
Diane.

487
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,502
I'm glad you're safe.

488
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:44,346
Now, any trouble
while I was away?

489
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,668
Nothing important.

490
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,271
Brother, no new holes in you,
I trust?

491
00:27:51,313 --> 00:27:53,315
- None that I've noticed.
<i>- Please.</i>

492
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:58,679
In honor of your victory, Duke.

493
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:11,852
Thank you, my child.

494
00:28:11,894 --> 00:28:13,734
Why don't you present them
to our king?

495
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:14,856
No, no.

496
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:17,378
No.

497
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,542
No, you should celebrate
your-your triumph, Francois.

498
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:24,946
That was your triumph,
Your Majesty.

499
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:28,271
Your strategy.
Well, yours and...madam's.

500
00:28:39,203 --> 00:28:41,285
Francis.

501
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:44,526
Why did your father
fight the Holy Roman emperor?

502
00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:46,849
I-I already told you.
For the sovereignty of France.

503
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,571
Yes, but...they worship
the same God.

504
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,293
Would-wouldn't
it have been better

505
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:54,376
if they'd just joined forces
and fought those who do not?

506
00:28:54,418 --> 00:28:56,421
My father knows best.

507
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,103
Yes.
Of course he does.

508
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,232
-Gentle, for fuck's sake.
-Listen to you.

509
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:10,673
Riding around the place,

510
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,836
fighting with anyone
you can get your hands on.

511
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:14,798
Truth is,
you're a fucking baby.

512
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,439
After you finish
washing my ass,

513
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:17,881
I'll get up and teach you
how to speak to your betters.

514
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,165
Yeah? I'd like to see you try.

515
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,810
Hello, Mother.
I'll be out in a minute.

516
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:28,492
No rush.

517
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,774
Hope I'm not interrupting.

518
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:32,818
Of course not.

519
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,459
The more, the merrier.

520
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:37,301
So, did you bring me a present?

521
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,343
I was gonna get you
a buxom Belgian maid

522
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:40,985
to comfort you in
your long nights of the soul,

523
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:44,028
and then I remembered
you took a vow of celibacy.

524
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,470
Mm, more of a suggestion
than a vow, actually.

525
00:29:46,512 --> 00:29:47,672
And guess what.

526
00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:48,913
If I decide to break it,

527
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:50,314
I can forgive myself.

528
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:52,917
No, your brother
has been far too busy

529
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,159
for dark nights of the soul
while you've been gone.

530
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:57,842
Isn't that right, Charles?

531
00:29:57,884 --> 00:29:59,886
You may go.

532
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:01,646
No, he's nearly finished.

533
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:04,651
Oh, I can bathe my own son,
can't I?

534
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,453
No, your brother has been

535
00:30:08,495 --> 00:30:10,816
letting himself
be outmaneuvered

536
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:13,659
by that slow-moving dolt
married to the king

537
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:16,902
while you managed
to carry the king's colors

538
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:18,704
onto the battlefield

539
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:20,065
while he watched
from the sidelines.

540
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:21,226
With help from Diane.

541
00:30:21,268 --> 00:30:24,470
Yes, well,
she will regret that.

542
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,352
Maybe Catherine is the one
we should watch.

543
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:28,234
Okay.

544
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:29,475
Is this really necessary?

545
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:30,997
Oh, I'm sorry.

546
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,758
Am I being unfair?

547
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,001
Have I said something untrue?

548
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,243
The queen wanted
something from you,

549
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:38,885
and instead
of extracting a price,

550
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:40,566
you let her go around you.

551
00:30:40,608 --> 00:30:42,851
Now, hmm,
what does that make you?

552
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:45,331
Go on. Say it.

553
00:30:45,373 --> 00:30:47,375
<i>It makes you...</i>

554
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:49,776
Irrelevant.

555
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:51,818
Precisely.

556
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,624
Not like your big,
strong brother.

557
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,721
Why do you do that to him?

558
00:31:13,763 --> 00:31:15,162
You know he doesn't like it.

559
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:16,764
Oh, well, that's his problem.

560
00:31:16,806 --> 00:31:18,766
He's always been
so straightforward.

561
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:22,089
Not like you
in your pretty little skirts.

562
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,811
Yet I did not choose this.

563
00:31:23,853 --> 00:31:25,493
Shame.

564
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:28,418
Would you like to have a little
cry over how unfair life can be?

565
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,101
You know,
there's two schools of thought

566
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:35,145
when it comes to parenting.

567
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,827
One is to love your child
unconditionally

568
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:41,790
so they suffer the delusion
the world will do the same.

569
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:43,231
The other is to break them

570
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:45,273
before the world
does it more cruelly.

571
00:31:45,315 --> 00:31:47,636
And I wonder what school
of thought you fall into.

572
00:31:47,678 --> 00:31:49,998
I simply prepared you both
for life as it is,

573
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,361
not as a mother wishes it were.

574
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:55,564
You need to make
yourself essential

575
00:31:55,606 --> 00:31:56,966
to the governing
of this country.

576
00:31:57,008 --> 00:31:59,288
And how do you propose
I do that?

577
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,450
You don't know?

578
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:04,373
You have the piece
already in your hand.

579
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:07,176
Your niece, Mary Stuart,

580
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,139
thinks she's on a mission
from God.

581
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:13,224
You can't buy that sort of
singularity of purpose.

582
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:16,266
All you need to do

583
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:19,189
is make yourself a conduit
to her calling,

584
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:21,511
and she will
give you the throne.

585
00:32:33,325 --> 00:32:35,245
The king has asked
not to be disturbed.

586
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,289
Not by me.

587
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,172
By anyone, madam.

588
00:32:41,213 --> 00:32:42,893
He said so?

589
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:44,937
Quite specifically.

590
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,742
I see.

591
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:10,241
Oh.

592
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:11,483
Oh?

593
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:13,325
Is that
how you greet your king?

594
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,806
Your Highness.

595
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:16,208
I'll tell the queen
you are here.

596
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,252
Yes, you do that.

597
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:22,815
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

598
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:26,580
Would you be so kind
as to go for a ride with me?

599
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:39,634
You.

600
00:33:40,755 --> 00:33:42,635
I have a job for you.

601
00:33:42,677 --> 00:33:45,160
-What?
-I want you to follow someone.

602
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:54,089
Ahh...

603
00:33:59,815 --> 00:34:01,817
Another.

604
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,739
-No.
-No?

605
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:07,783
You take too much.

606
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,793
You have no idea.

607
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:43,498
I know where you were.

608
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,542
Ah, are you jealous?

609
00:34:47,264 --> 00:34:49,224
You know
what Catherine would say.

610
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:51,426
I don't care
what Catherine would say.

611
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:53,548
You have to pick a horse.

612
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,990
After all, it's not personal.

613
00:34:55,032 --> 00:34:56,391
Those two will cut
right through you

614
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:57,633
to get at each other.

615
00:34:57,675 --> 00:34:58,874
Yeah, at least
Diane's honest about it.

616
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:01,236
Do you want to know
what I think?

617
00:35:01,278 --> 00:35:04,480
I think you know
there's some...

618
00:35:04,522 --> 00:35:08,206
small possibility
that you might be loved by me.

619
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,210
And so you will do everything

620
00:35:12,971 --> 00:35:14,973
to make sure it isn't so.

621
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:19,015
Well, someone once told me

622
00:35:19,057 --> 00:35:21,818
if you love something in this
world, you can never be free.

623
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,143
So, I think
I'll take gold over love.

624
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:31,788
Then you'll want this back.

625
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,736
It's beautiful, isn't it?

626
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:02,101
This is the house the Guises
stole off some Protestant, eh?

627
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:05,625
I met the man.

628
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:11,709
Well, it's mine now,
apparently.

629
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:13,754
A gift.

630
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:16,995
A gift to curry favor
with the new king.

631
00:36:17,037 --> 00:36:18,837
<i>What do you think I should do?</i>

632
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:20,881
Accept?

633
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,442
Let it be known
that I'm easily bought?

634
00:36:23,484 --> 00:36:26,325
Or turn it down at the risk
of the Guises'...

635
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,369
ire?

636
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:32,213
You'll make the right decision.

637
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:34,535
Perhaps.

638
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:38,898
I think you've always seen
something in me that I...

639
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,062
have trouble
really believing exists.

640
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:45,426
The same as Diane.

641
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,552
Can I ask you a question?

642
00:36:52,674 --> 00:36:54,676
Is it too late for us?

643
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,402
It is never too late.

644
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:06,208
Again...I believed
he could love me.

645
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,250
When I was in the front,
playing the part of a...

646
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:12,414
a toy soldier

647
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:15,455
wrapped in cotton,

648
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:18,701
you...were a real regent.

649
00:37:24,186 --> 00:37:26,189
I want you to have it.

650
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:30,753
In gratitude for what you did.

651
00:37:33,156 --> 00:37:35,158
I don't need inducements.

652
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,644
But I do have
a small favor to ask.

653
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:50,211
You kept your word.

654
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:52,256
What else do I have?

655
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:54,696
I'm impressed.

656
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:56,740
And I'm free to speak my mind?

657
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:00,304
You are.

658
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,147
My family came up
the same as yours.

659
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,829
Through hard work and trade.

660
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:08,873
You can trust me.

661
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:16,519
<i>Finally secure in my position,</i>

662
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,281
<i>I wanted</i>
<i>to lend a helping hand</i>

663
00:38:18,323 --> 00:38:20,325
<i>to someone</i>
<i>in more need than I.</i>

664
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:25,248
Your Majesty,

665
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,332
congratulations
on your victory.

666
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,414
I understand we have a lot
to thank you for.

667
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:34,177
<i>Your loyalty</i>
<i>will not go unnoticed.</i>

668
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:36,299
We only have your wife
to thank for that.

669
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:38,461
<i>She makes</i>
<i>a persuasive argument.</i>

670
00:38:38,503 --> 00:38:40,506
She does indeed.

671
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:43,389
I believe you have something
you'd like to say to me?

672
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:47,873
I do.

673
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:52,196
I began life
as a tailor's apprentice.

674
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:53,917
<i>Didn't have any schooling.</i>

675
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:56,640
<i>I worked my way up</i>
<i>until I owned the business.</i>

676
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:58,684
I never asked anything
from anyone.

677
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,967
But every time

678
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,770
I have two pennies
to rub together,

679
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:09,055
one of my betters takes them.

680
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:12,819
Just like they took my home.

681
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,384
Now, they say it's because
I worship the wrong God.

682
00:39:17,904 --> 00:39:18,823
It's not.

683
00:39:18,865 --> 00:39:21,866
<i>It's because I'm common.</i>

684
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:25,632
And when I go to those who
are supposed to be my allies,

685
00:39:26,673 --> 00:39:28,916
they take from me as well.

686
00:39:29,676 --> 00:39:32,918
Because...I'm common.

687
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,841
I should remind you
who you are addressing.

688
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:40,085
I know I'm uncouth,

689
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,768
but you need to hear this,

690
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,251
<i>because if free men can't make</i>
<i>their way in this country,</i>

691
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:49,177
mark my words, sooner or later,
they'll come for you.

692
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:52,378
<i>For all of you.</i>

693
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,541
And they'll put all your
pretty little heads on spikes.

694
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:57,503
<i>You know it as well as I do.</i>

695
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:00,228
<i>You're only hoping it</i>
<i>doesn't happen on your watch.</i>

696
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:03,069
Because you can
put on your show

697
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,912
with your rituals
and your finery,

698
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:08,475
<i>but you know</i>
<i>it won't last forever.</i>

699
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:11,998
Sooner or later,
they'll catch on

700
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,243
and see that you're no
different than the rest of us!

701
00:40:16,285 --> 00:40:18,005
How dare you!

702
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:21,568
The king grants you an audience
and you come with threats?

703
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,931
Oh, pshh, a warning.

704
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:26,734
<i>- Not threats.</i>
<i>- It's all right.</i>

705
00:40:26,776 --> 00:40:29,298
- It's all right.
<i>- No, it's not.</i>

706
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:31,661
No, it's not!

707
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:35,743
If your father could see you
show such weakness,

708
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:37,787
he would be ashamed!

709
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:42,432
A tailor who thinks he can
speak his mind to the king?

710
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:44,632
I should have you whipped,

711
00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:47,555
and then perhaps
you will remember your place!

712
00:40:47,597 --> 00:40:50,799
Who are you
to tell me of my place?

713
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:53,201
<i>The king's mistress</i>
<i>is supposed to be invisible,</i>

714
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,562
<i>seen and not heard.</i>

715
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:56,564
<i>But you, you-you prance around</i>

716
00:40:56,606 --> 00:40:59,888
<i>without even a sense</i>
<i>to be ashamed of yourself!</i>

717
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,732
The way you carried on
at the coronation?

718
00:41:03,774 --> 00:41:05,854
<i>Did you think</i>
<i>they were cheering you?</i>

719
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,095
<i>They were laughing!</i>

720
00:41:07,137 --> 00:41:08,657
- <i>That's enough.</i>
- At both of you!

721
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,539
A king who doesn't fight
with his men?

722
00:41:10,581 --> 00:41:12,101
- I said that's enough!
<i>- Because he'd rather</i>

723
00:41:12,143 --> 00:41:14,423
-be fucking his whore!
-He is your king!

724
00:41:14,465 --> 00:41:16,785
Chosen by God!

725
00:41:16,827 --> 00:41:18,830
That makes me God's choice!

726
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,991
Or God's whore, if you like!

727
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:24,035
No God of mine.

728
00:41:25,436 --> 00:41:27,637
Now, if you'll excuse me...

729
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:33,244
...I think I've had enough.

730
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:44,935
<i>Quickly, quickly!</i>

731
00:42:00,673 --> 00:42:02,675
Forgive me.

732
00:42:03,836 --> 00:42:06,036
I did it for you.

733
00:42:06,078 --> 00:42:08,081
It needed to be done.

734
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:12,005
You're my king.

735
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:17,891
Of course.

736
00:42:19,212 --> 00:42:21,693
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

737
00:42:21,735 --> 00:42:23,414
Of course.

738
00:42:23,456 --> 00:42:25,136
You are forgiven.

739
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:31,102
<i>You are-you are forgiven.</i>
<i>You are forgiven.</i>

740
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:49,762
<i>I attempted to find refuge</i>

741
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:52,845
<i>from the turmoil at court</i>
<i>at Chenonceau,</i>

742
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:55,089
<i>the house that started it all.</i>

743
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:06,982
Hello, cousin.

744
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:10,545
Cousin.

745
00:43:11,706 --> 00:43:13,426
Henri and I have decided

746
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:16,189
we shall make Chenonceau
our country home

747
00:43:16,231 --> 00:43:18,233
instead of Chaumont.

748
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:20,676
Charming, isn't it?

749
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:30,444
Who will rid me of this woman?

750
00:43:42,258 --> 00:43:43,778
You look familiar.

751
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,822
I hear you tell fortunes.

752
00:43:46,222 --> 00:43:48,224
It's a cheap trick, really.

753
00:43:51,307 --> 00:43:53,310
Tell mine.

754
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:56,313
Ah.

755
00:43:57,354 --> 00:44:00,875
In a few hours,
you'll be shit-faced.

756
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:03,598
<i>More shit-faced</i>
<i>than you already are.</i>

757
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,120
<i>You'll probably get</i>
<i>in a fight,</i>

758
00:44:05,162 --> 00:44:07,564
but you can handle yourself,
so you'll be all right.

759
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:11,769
<i>Today, that is.</i>

760
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:17,012
'Cause you'll get older.

761
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,056
And you'll get slower.

762
00:44:19,817 --> 00:44:22,538
And, eventually,
you'll end up dead in a ditch.

763
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,699
<i>Pig food.</i>

764
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:25,743
Like me.

765
00:44:26,784 --> 00:44:28,786
Despite the fact

766
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:33,789
that you gave your whole life

767
00:44:33,831 --> 00:44:35,992
to a king and a way of life

768
00:44:36,034 --> 00:44:39,357
that never gave a fuck
about you in the first place.

769
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,082
It's no trick.

770
00:44:47,806 --> 00:44:49,928
Turns out,
you are a fortune teller.

771
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:05,664
You all right, son?

772
00:45:07,306 --> 00:45:08,946
I'm fine.

773
00:45:08,988 --> 00:45:10,708
Can I be of any help to you?

774
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,030
I said I'm fine.

775
00:45:13,072 --> 00:45:16,193
Perhaps a place
offered for the night.

776
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:17,475
Protection.

777
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:24,882
You are offering your charity?

778
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:27,327
It is a Christian thing to do.

779
00:45:34,054 --> 00:45:36,056
How much for the girl?

780
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:39,778
She is my daughter.

781
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,100
So? How much?

782
00:45:42,142 --> 00:45:44,144
You insult me.

783
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:48,949
That enough?

784
00:45:55,276 --> 00:45:56,876
Let me talk to her.

785
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:59,558
She's young, but she can learn.

786
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,961
She'll make a good wife
eventually.

787
00:46:02,003 --> 00:46:05,044
What sort of man sells
his own daughter, huh?

788
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:06,245
It's misunderstood--

789
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:08,167
I-I didn't misunderstand.

790
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:10,410
Now, I'd like to think
she's not your flesh and blood.

791
00:46:10,452 --> 00:46:12,011
I'd like to think
you found her along the way

792
00:46:12,053 --> 00:46:13,973
and you've been passing her off
as your own,

793
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:17,339
but the world is not
as I'd like it to be, is it?

794
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:21,941
So tell me, how does it feel

795
00:46:21,983 --> 00:46:23,423
to know that in a moment's time

796
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:26,787
when you cease to exist,
no one will object,

797
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:30,390
no one will mourn,
no one will even notice?

798
00:46:30,432 --> 00:46:32,913
-I beg you.
-Oh, don't bother.

799
00:46:32,955 --> 00:46:35,155
I've killed for the king.
I've killed for money.

800
00:46:35,197 --> 00:46:36,997
Neither has brought me
as much pleasure

801
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:38,479
as killing
out of sheer distaste.

802
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:40,523
<i>Spare him!</i>

803
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:46,046
He's not worth
the air he breathes.

804
00:46:46,088 --> 00:46:48,091
I don't disagree.

805
00:46:49,252 --> 00:46:51,334
<i>But he is my father.</i>

806
00:46:52,655 --> 00:46:54,175
Is that what you want?

807
00:47:17,441 --> 00:47:19,443
It is not all I want.

808
00:47:20,764 --> 00:47:23,165
I'm not in the business
of granting wishes.

809
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,770
I want you to take me with you.

810
00:47:28,132 --> 00:47:30,134
I don't even know
where I'm going.

811
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:32,937
I know.

812
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:37,019
<i>As I look back,</i>

813
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:39,464
<i>one danger</i>
<i>only prepared me for the next.</i>

814
00:47:43,268 --> 00:47:45,270
I will do as you ask.

815
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:47,792
I'll search Mary's chambers
for you.

816
00:47:50,475 --> 00:47:52,477
You are a true friend.

817
00:47:52,878 --> 00:47:56,439
After all, one must be a fox

818
00:47:56,481 --> 00:47:58,241
to find the snares

819
00:47:58,283 --> 00:48:01,286
and a lion
to frighten the wolves.

820
00:48:09,175 --> 00:48:11,177
Oh.

821
00:48:18,024 --> 00:48:20,785
My dear mother-in-law,

822
00:48:20,827 --> 00:48:25,389
I heard you wished
to take a walk with me?

823
00:48:25,431 --> 00:48:27,433
Yes.

824
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,997
It's a small matter
of scripture

825
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,041
that I would like to share.

826
00:48:37,364 --> 00:48:38,963
It's a passage
that is helping me

827
00:48:39,005 --> 00:48:41,886
through my own grief
over King Francis' death.

828
00:48:41,928 --> 00:48:43,408
How thoughtful.

829
00:48:48,655 --> 00:48:50,657
"You will grieve,

830
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:53,420
<i>"but your grief</i>
<i>will become joy.</i>

831
00:48:55,543 --> 00:48:58,384
<i>"But you shall lament and weep</i>

832
00:48:58,426 --> 00:49:01,667
<i>"that the world shall rejoice</i>

833
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:04,190
<i>"and you shall</i>
<i>be made sorrowful.</i>

834
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,952
<i>Your sorrow shall</i>
<i>be turned into joy."</i>

835
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:08,996
Yes. John.

836
00:49:09,757 --> 00:49:11,759
Chapter 16, verse 20.

837
00:49:13,281 --> 00:49:14,961
Precisely.

838
00:49:15,003 --> 00:49:18,086
I see why you think
that would be a comfort for me.

839
00:49:25,574 --> 00:49:27,896
My dear, you look cold.

840
00:49:29,858 --> 00:49:31,097
I'm fine.

841
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:32,499
<i>Nonsense.</i>

842
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:34,381
Go fetch your mistress a shawl.

843
00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:11,179
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

844
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:21,253
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
