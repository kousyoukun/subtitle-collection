1
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:12,098
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i>The Serpent Queen...

2
00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:15,669
Madame de Poitiers,
the king is dead.

3
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,933
I will wind her up
and watch that silly girl

4
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:21,390
burn this country
to the ground.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,427
My first order of business--

6
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:24,846
A decree that makes
Protestantism illegal

7
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:25,538
on French soil.

8
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:27,150
-Fuck off.
-Banishment.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,723
You bitch. You fucking bitch.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,756
Our niece
is out of fucking control.

11
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:33,563
Do you have a plan?

12
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:35,636
Separate the king
from Mary's influence.

13
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:38,401
I must ask you to reconsider

14
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,630
<i>before we reach</i>
<i>our destination.</i>

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,051
Or what happens
at our destination, Mother?

16
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:42,932
I just don't want
to see anything happen to you.

17
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:45,006
That's all.

18
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,733
Help, help, help!

19
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:47,693
I believe Catherine

20
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:49,345
was responsible
for what happened.

21
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:52,148
I wrote to my cousin
in England asking for help.

22
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:54,682
I believe Catherine
has intercepted

23
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,142
her letter in return.

24
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,485
It would be my honor

25
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:00,750
<i>to help you rid France</i>
<i>of the Serpent Queen.</i>

26
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,710
Good.

27
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:53,971
Are you looking for me, hm?

28
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:57,506
Apparently,
I'm not the only one.

29
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:58,732
I presume you're the one

30
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:01,653
who told Mary
where her men could find me.

31
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,068
Catherine did not
leave me much choice.

32
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:08,754
No, no, she's good at that.

33
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:15,630
Is this what you're here for?

34
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,740
Do you know what it is?

35
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:21,541
Queen Elizabeth's seal.

36
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:24,961
Or a rough approximation of it,
yeah.

37
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,108
Now all you have to do

38
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,679
is decide what you're
gonna do with it, hm?

39
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,003
You wanted to see me?

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,877
You've been listening
to my story for a few days now.

41
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:57,332
Would you like
to know how it ends?

42
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,056
I would.

43
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,937
But perhaps I should
be the one to tell you.

44
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:09,773
That was the plan, was it not?

45
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:13,536
Go on then.

46
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:15,454
I'm listening.

47
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,755
You convinced
Montmorency and the Bourbons

48
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:22,174
<i>to join your kidnapping plot.</i>

49
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:28,203
Though you
may have regretted it

50
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:29,969
<i>almost immediately.</i>

51
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,197
Francis, oh, my--please!

52
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:33,694
<i>I didn't think he was ill.</i>

53
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,614
- Francis.
<i>- Please, help me!</i>

54
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,955
- <i>Help, help, help!</i>
- Stop the carriage!

55
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,183
<i>Stop!</i>

56
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:42,219
<i>Stop now!</i>

57
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,370
<i>Hold!</i>

58
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:47,671
<i>Hold the carriage!</i>

59
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,284
Why are they stopping there?

60
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:51,165
How the fuck should I know?

61
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:56,502
Someone help him, please!

62
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:57,847
Mary--

63
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,767
<i>What's going on?</i>

64
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:03,569
<i>Help, help, help.</i>
<i>Please!</i>

65
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,102
<i>So you devised another plan...</i>

66
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:06,640
Help me!

67
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:07,792
<i>A plan that would help you</i>

68
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,522
<i>assume a power</i>

69
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:10,672
<i>you always knew</i>
<i>should be yours...</i>

70
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:11,671
What's she doing?

71
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,514
<i>And yours alone.</i>

72
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:15,127
An attack on the king!

73
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,388
Surround the king!

74
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:22,538
Get down!

75
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,186
Stay with the carriage!

76
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,368
It's okay, it's okay.

77
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,358
Fuck this.

78
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:08,079
Francis, please.

79
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,883
Don't leave me alone
in this wicked, godless world.

80
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:13,110
Please!

81
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,453
Ahh!

82
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,137
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck.

83
00:05:34,423 --> 00:05:35,343
You?

84
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:45,940
No, no, no, no,
you... you misunderstand.

85
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:48,168
Un-fucking-believable.

86
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,050
I was- I was here to protect the
king.

87
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,816
I... I'd heard rumors
of a plot.

88
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:54,657
Oh, so that's why
you're in a wood,

89
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:57,038
hiding underneath a log?

90
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,419
-Yeah.
-Mm.

91
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,840
You're so fucked.

92
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,977
<i>The attack is over!</i>

93
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:16,507
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

94
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:24,993
What are you doing?

95
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:26,337
I don't know what the fuck
you're playing at,

96
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:27,988
but if he talks, Mary
won't leave a head in place.

97
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:30,561
I won't say anything,
not a word, I swear.

98
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:31,789
Antoine,
I've known you all your life,

99
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,403
and you stand
for absolutely nothing.

100
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,129
I can't trust you.

101
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:36,897
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

102
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:39,508
-He is the regent!
-I don't give a shit who he is.

103
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:52,486
What the fuck is happening?

104
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:57,171
Antoine, you must run.

105
00:06:57,212 --> 00:06:59,321
Follow the creek,
and in a few miles,

106
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:00,320
you will find a farmhouse.

107
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,434
<i>I will send someone for you.</i>

108
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:02,970
<i>You will be safe there.</i>

109
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,658
Antoine, do you want to die?

110
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:06,541
<i>Run!</i>

111
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:10,880
Please forgive me.

112
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:24,780
What happened?

113
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,816
It was Antoine.

114
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:27,660
Antoine?

115
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,003
Didn't think he had it in him.

116
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:31,385
He's still breathing. Guard!

117
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:32,998
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- Get help!

118
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:34,188
Take the constable
to the hospital,

119
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:35,494
and make sure
he's well-guarded!

120
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:36,723
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

121
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:45,557
We will bring the dogs
and hunt him down.

122
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,089
I wouldn't worry.

123
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:50,969
It's Antoine, he won't get far.

124
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,929
You wouldn't worry?

125
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:55,845
Do you have any idea
what just happened?

126
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:58,265
If my idiot cousins think
they can get away with this,

127
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:01,684
we're closer to civil war
than any of us imagined.

128
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:04,178
We need to find Antoine
and kill him

129
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:07,942
<i>before he raises an army</i>
<i>of pissed off Protestants.</i>

130
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:09,902
Of course.

131
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:18,887
Is it possible that this
is God's plan for me...

132
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:21,765
...when I am yet so young?

133
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:25,567
Niece, whatever
His divine plan may be,

134
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:28,485
you can always turn to me,
as God's representative,

135
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:29,522
for comfort and guidance.

136
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:31,442
Yes, Mary,
take comfort in the church,

137
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:33,899
and leave governance to us,
your uncles.

138
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:36,280
<i>We have your best interests</i>
<i>at heart.</i>

139
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,392
But my faith
and my governance are one.

140
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:40,466
Yes, up until this moment.

141
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,501
But the thing is,
the Bourbons would never

142
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,652
have attempted
something like this

143
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:46,878
if they did not believe they
had the support of the people.

144
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:47,954
There is widespread discontent

145
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,603
with these
anti-Protestant policies.

146
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:51,601
I have heard there are critics

147
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:54,099
even in the king's
personal bodyguard.

148
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,363
The king's men?

149
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,092
Turn against him?

150
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,052
No, that's impossible.

151
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,396
Actually, it is possible.

152
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,701
They've been asked to arrest
and, in some instances,

153
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,776
<i>execute their own kinsmen.</i>

154
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:05,848
Tends to get people
a little exercised.

155
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:07,038
<i>With the king ill,</i>

156
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:08,689
if people were to turn
against the Crown,

157
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:11,492
we would lose control
of the whole country.

158
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:14,488
We need to act rationally,
unemotionally.

159
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:18,867
And that is why you must
let us deal with things.

160
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:21,631
Queen Mother.

161
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,701
What do you think?

162
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:29,923
I can only think of the health
of my son, our king.

163
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:33,036
I would hope your uncles
could do the same.

164
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,914
Well said.

165
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:42,826
How is the king?

166
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:44,938
I have made
a thorough examination.

167
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:48,048
There is significant blockage
to both lungs,

168
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,775
as well as extensive
lacerations,

169
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:52,848
<i>which suggest consumption,</i>

170
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:56,229
something he
was perhaps born with.

171
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,685
<i>Will he live?</i>

172
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:03,600
The king's survival
is extremely unlikely.

173
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:09,475
No! No!

174
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,393
Is the strain from the attack?

175
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:13,699
<i>Is the... the people</i>

176
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,657
responsible for this
will be punished.

177
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:18,268
They have seen nothing yet.

178
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:19,882
Do you hear me?

179
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:22,607
No, we will
soak France in blood

180
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,722
for their treachery!

181
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:41,730
-You have visitors.
-Your Majesty.

182
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,574
We've come to offer
our condolences.

183
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:47,414
I cannot imagine what you're
going through at this time.

184
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:51,215
Seems as if I am cursed
to outlive those dearest to me.

185
00:10:51,256 --> 00:10:53,212
Now, I know
this is a delicate situation,

186
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:57,627
Your Majesty,
but the question of succession

187
00:10:57,668 --> 00:10:59,588
needs to be addressed.

188
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:02,429
What question?

189
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:03,964
My second son, Charles IX,

190
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,384
will be king
when his brother dies.

191
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:07,112
Of course,
but due to his youth,

192
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:09,495
all power must rest
with the regent.

193
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:11,836
Antoine of Bourbon.

194
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,796
Had it escaped your mind?

195
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:15,329
<i>I know not very much does.</i>

196
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,672
Initially, the people
will certainly demand

197
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:20,398
we follow the correct line
of succession.

198
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:23,125
But once they hear
of the plot against the king,

199
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:25,930
<i>I'm sure they're</i>
<i>gonna change their mind.</i>

200
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:27,771
A new regent may be possible,

201
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:31,611
but the candidate
has to be trusted by the king.

202
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:36,106
Someone esteemed,
and with experience.

203
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:41,597
But who?

204
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,015
We were thinking
of Montmorency.

205
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:48,622
Montmorency
is an honorable man,

206
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:51,540
but he is hardly in favor.

207
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,113
Up until recently,
he was living in exile.

208
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:55,457
Yes, but the people like him.

209
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,606
And he represents
a bygone era of stability.

210
00:11:58,646 --> 00:11:59,488
But what of his condition?

211
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,601
He's stable, I'm sure
you'll be pleased to hear.

212
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:04,711
Yes, expected
to make a full recovery,

213
00:12:04,752 --> 00:12:06,631
God be praised.

214
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:07,515
A miracle.

215
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:11,357
We will, however,
need the king's support.

216
00:12:11,702 --> 00:12:14,659
Can we rely on you
to convince him?

217
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:17,884
Of course.

218
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,298
But to transfer regency,

219
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,410
the regent himself
must sign it over.

220
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,946
Yes, we're very much
aware of that.

221
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:28,020
My men are searching
the country as we speak.

222
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,440
<i>Antoine has proved himself</i>

223
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:31,937
<i>to be surprisingly</i>
<i>stubborn prey.</i>

224
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:33,897
Like hunting a mole.

225
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:38,195
If I may make a suggestion,

226
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:41,307
Louis has been arrested
for treason.

227
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:43,302
Offer him clemency

228
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:46,414
in return for the whereabouts
of his brother.

229
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:47,219
No.

230
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:48,717
After the plot
against the king,

231
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:51,520
<i>Mary will never</i>
<i>go for clemency.</i>

232
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,937
No, but the new regent will.

233
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:00,352
And in the meantime,
she needn't find out.

234
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:06,611
You really do have vision.

235
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,873
Through my grief.

236
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:24,389
Our Father, who art in heaven,

237
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,463
give me the strength
to face my enemies.

238
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:32,340
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done.

239
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,321
This grief feels unbearable,
I know.

240
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,393
<i>But a dying king</i>

241
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:49,311
<i>makes for</i>
<i>a very dangerous time.</i>

242
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:52,421
Now is not the moment
to lose your wits.

243
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:55,150
I have not lost my wits.

244
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:57,836
I am planning
a cruel and unusual revenge

245
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:00,141
on all of France's traitors.

246
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,903
You can do that later...

247
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:09,588
When you are regent.

248
00:14:11,238 --> 00:14:11,698
Regent?

249
00:14:11,738 --> 00:14:13,425
<i>It is difficult</i>
<i>to contemplate,</i>

250
00:14:13,465 --> 00:14:17,726
but soon,
your husband will be no more,

251
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:20,453
<i>and his brother</i>
<i>too young to rule.</i>

252
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:23,870
A regent is the highest power
in the land.

253
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:27,134
<i>Look ahead, Mary.</i>

254
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:28,747
<i>Shouldn't that be you?</i>

255
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,585
Well, if it would help France.

256
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:37,885
And it be God's... God's will.

257
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:40,192
I believe it is.

258
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:43,917
But there are those
who conspire against you.

259
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:44,990
Who?

260
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,795
I have often wondered
if the Cardinal

261
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,137
is the Catholic
he claims to be.

262
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:49,982
I am sorry to say

263
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,439
a similar thought
has crossed my mind.

264
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:53,707
They have confided in me

265
00:14:53,747 --> 00:14:56,202
they wish
to make Montmorency regent

266
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:59,737
to appease the very men
who attacked our king.

267
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,770
Whereas I, like you,

268
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:04,765
believe now
is not the time to falter.

269
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:10,220
I had not expected
a friend in you, but...

270
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,981
I'm grateful nonetheless.

271
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:18,975
We are united
in our love for the king.

272
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:22,774
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

273
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:23,850
Do not let anyone

274
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:26,384
stand in the way
of your calling.

275
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:32,720
One thing men cannot abide
is a woman in power.

276
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,046
I have to ask you, cousin,

277
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:47,888
what the fuck
were you thinking?

278
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:48,541
I told you,

279
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,844
I was there to prevent
an attack on the king.

280
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:52,534
That you knew about because...

281
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:54,684
I told you, I'd heard rumor.

282
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:56,604
I thought it was my duty
to intervene.

283
00:15:56,645 --> 00:16:00,022
I am but a loyal servant
of the Crown.

284
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:01,981
Fucked is what you are.

285
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,169
Mary's gonna cut off
your fat head.

286
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,128
-She wouldn't dare.
-Oh, she would.

287
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:07,318
Well, then there'll be
a civil war.

288
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:09,968
A holy war, if she's got
anything to do with it.

289
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:10,774
She'll love that.

290
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:16,150
Well, if she cuts off my head,
yours will be next.

291
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,110
Mark my words.

292
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:26,325
Ah.

293
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:28,900
Already crossed your mind,
has it?

294
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:31,740
That's the thing about zealots.

295
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,738
<i>Nothing's ever enough.</i>

296
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:37,423
-Oh, God.
-What?

297
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,421
<i>Come on, it's not that bad.</i>

298
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:39,765
That's what you think,
because you haven't

299
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:42,146
been through
what I've been through.

300
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:44,143
Exiled, unemployed,

301
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,792
separated from the only person
you've ever trusted,

302
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:48,827
burdened with a truth
that nobody'd believe,

303
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:50,325
<i>because in this game we play,</i>

304
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:54,203
you sound like a fucking liar
whether you are or not,

305
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:56,164
and finally...

306
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,272
...sentenced to death.

307
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:03,536
We can avoid all that.

308
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:07,107
Hold on, hold on.

309
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:10,100
What is this truth
you speak of?

310
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:14,019
You wouldn't believe me,
but trust me when I say...

311
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:18,434
...you have a serpent
in your midst.

312
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:19,547
We know.

313
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:20,200
Mary.

314
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,082
That's why we're here.

315
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,580
You don't have
the faintest idea

316
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:23,732
what's going on, do you?

317
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:24,807
<i>Listen to me.</i>

318
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:28,264
All you have to do
is tell us where Antoine is,

319
00:17:28,304 --> 00:17:29,992
and you will be pardoned.

320
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:33,947
No, you listen to me,
you fucking idiot.

321
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:36,673
If I knew
where the fuck Antoine was,

322
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:39,322
I would tell you, but I don't.

323
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:45,197
I really don't.

324
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:49,806
I wish I did,
because I miss him.

325
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,724
I miss my big brother...

326
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:55,988
twat that he is.

327
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:03,898
I won't do it.

328
00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:06,048
Why should I?

329
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:06,893
You've done it before.

330
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,888
An apple filled with poison
I never forced anyone to eat

331
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:11,923
is an entirely different thing.

332
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:15,072
He's half dead already.

333
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:18,413
And besides which, if he lives,

334
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:19,565
it will mean our destruction.

335
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:22,061
You should have thought of that
before you stabbed him.

336
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:27,821
This is not a request.

337
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:33,811
If you fail,
don't bother coming back.

338
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,065
I win again.

339
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:45,947
And without any strategy
or skill.

340
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:48,095
How do you do it?

341
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:49,670
Pure luck.

342
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,628
It's just always been my way.

343
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:53,855
Drives Louis mad.

344
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,462
Oh.

345
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:05,529
I see Aabis has been
taking very good care of you.

346
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:06,258
Well, this isn't

347
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,947
the most salubrious
accommodation I've been in.

348
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:10,867
Well, I'm sure
Louis would prefer this

349
00:19:10,907 --> 00:19:13,017
to where he finds himself.

350
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:13,862
How is he?

351
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,705
As well as one could imagine,

352
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:17,317
being in a dungeon.

353
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,739
Would you give us
a moment, please?

354
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,567
We have business to discuss.

355
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:30,834
Indeed, we do.

356
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:33,137
I could be
a bit more comfortable.

357
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:35,749
My understanding
is that confit de canard

358
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,093
is the specialty
of this region,

359
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,972
which, along with
a nice chilled Burgundy,

360
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,739
would ease my pain somewhat.

361
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:46,692
Indeed, of course.

362
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:50,496
And you shall have
all of that and more...

363
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:54,643
...as soon as you sign this.

364
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:07,661
Relinquish my regency?

365
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:10,656
To you?

366
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,960
Why would I do that?

367
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:16,913
Because, Antoine,

368
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:20,486
your brother has been
imprisoned for treason...

369
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:24,786
...and if you don't,
he'll be executed.

370
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,510
No.

371
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:32,426
What do you mean, no?

372
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:33,348
I mean no.

373
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:36,996
My brother told me never
to sign away my regency again,

374
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,069
and I won't.

375
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,413
But his life is in danger.

376
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:43,063
What proof do I have of that?

377
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:45,021
Louis is clever.

378
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,020
Always has been.

379
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,786
How do I know he didn't
evade the king's men,

380
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:49,322
and you're lying about him
being held captive?

381
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:51,588
<i>Wouldn't be the first time</i>
<i>you've lied about something.</i>

382
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:54,160
You hoodwinked us into this
whole fucking kidnapping thing

383
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,233
in the first place, against
Louis' better instincts,

384
00:20:57,273 --> 00:21:01,802
I might add,
and if he is imprisoned,

385
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:03,415
the only thing
keeping him alive

386
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:08,138
is the fact that I haven't
signed away my regency.

387
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,170
So in the words
of my dear grandmother,

388
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,013
get fucked.

389
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,806
You said you'd help me.

390
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:24,342
Now is not the time, Aabis.

391
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:25,110
Then when?

392
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,992
The situation
at the moment is very delicate.

393
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:29,910
I cannot be seen intervening
on behalf of a Protestant boy.

394
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,830
He's not a fucking Protestant.

395
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:37,016
And he won't survive
much longer in there.

396
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:39,164
Tell me,

397
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:40,162
what is the fate of a young boy

398
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:43,006
when the fate of a nation
hangs in the balance?

399
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,729
It is everything.

400
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,304
Well, I'm afraid
I don't have time

401
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:50,264
for such sentimentality.

402
00:21:50,763 --> 00:21:53,144
I'll see to your friend
when I'm able.

403
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:59,592
You finally reached
for the throne for yourself.

404
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:02,897
I just don't want
my son to suffer.

405
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:20,791
It contains an opiate
from the East.

406
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:27,165
With enough,
he will feel no pain.

407
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,965
But in his condition,
it will shorten his days.

408
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,994
His days are done already.

409
00:22:40,605 --> 00:22:44,328
He was marked
for an early grave since birth.

410
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:45,633
I pray I'm not the reason.

411
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:47,593
Do not falter.

412
00:22:48,707 --> 00:22:50,627
We are close.

413
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,044
We?

414
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,729
I saw this in you
the first day we met.

415
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:52,949
Where do you think
you're going?

416
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:55,559
I'm Sister Grace

417
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,132
of the Sacred Order
of the Diminutives,

418
00:23:58,172 --> 00:23:59,705
here to tend to the sick.

419
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:01,894
Order of the Diminutives.

420
00:24:01,934 --> 00:24:03,200
Is that some kind of joke?

421
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,967
You think I'd make that up?

422
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:07,347
I'm here to wash
and change the patient.

423
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,803
Go on, then.

424
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:13,491
You want to watch?

425
00:24:13,531 --> 00:24:14,835
I mean, I won't judge
if that's your thing,

426
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:17,907
but according to the Bible,
God certainly will.

427
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:23,974
I have to piss anyway.

428
00:24:53,236 --> 00:24:55,156
Mother...

429
00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:58,841
Mother, is that you?

430
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:02,373
Yes, my son.

431
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:03,525
Sleep now.

432
00:25:04,563 --> 00:25:06,636
<i>It hurts, Mother.</i>

433
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:08,018
Mother, it hurts.

434
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:10,206
It's only a dream.

435
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:11,858
Sleep now.

436
00:25:13,203 --> 00:25:15,659
You sure?

437
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,118
Doesn't feel like a dream.

438
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:19,463
Let me live, please.

439
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:22,266
Your mistress sent you.

440
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,373
Get me past the guards,
and I will let you live.

441
00:25:28,448 --> 00:25:30,368
Have you heard the news?

442
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:32,978
Montmorency...

443
00:25:33,018 --> 00:25:34,898
he's missing.

444
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:35,397
Missing?

445
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:36,548
I fear my uncles
may be involved,

446
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:39,543
and it is part of their plot
to name him as regent.

447
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,657
My...

448
00:25:40,697 --> 00:25:44,460
My maid saw them visiting Louis
in the dungeons.

449
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:46,840
Come with me.

450
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,145
There's not a moment to lose.

451
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,407
We need to leave here now.

452
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:53,828
France is no longer safe
for us.

453
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:56,095
I don't think
that's a good idea.

454
00:25:56,595 --> 00:25:57,438
<i>No.</i>

455
00:25:57,478 --> 00:25:58,628
I think what you want to do
is stay

456
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:00,970
and face your
responsibilities to France.

457
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:01,662
Yeah.

458
00:26:01,702 --> 00:26:02,775
Isn't that right, Edith?

459
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:05,156
-Don't you speak to her.
-Or what?

460
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,652
Don't look like you're in any
state to be making threats.

461
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:08,804
<i>Here's the thing.</i>

462
00:26:08,844 --> 00:26:10,378
The king's dying,
France needs a new regent,

463
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:12,222
and Antoine can't do it
'cause everybody knows

464
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:14,257
about his plot
against the king.

465
00:26:14,297 --> 00:26:16,369
<i>The situation requires</i>
<i>someone neutral,</i>

466
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,866
someone to settle the conflict.

467
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:21,477
That's you, Montmorency.

468
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:24,626
But make no mistake,

469
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:27,312
you will become our regent

470
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,964
<i>if you don't want anything</i>
<i>to happen</i>

471
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,422
<i>to those you care about.</i>

472
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,301
And you wonder why people
have begun to doubt the Church.

473
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:34,954
Listen to me.

474
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:37,449
We are better
than the fucking lunatic

475
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,062
that is in charge right now.

476
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:40,061
Are you surprised?

477
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,444
Your niece
is what you made her.

478
00:26:41,484 --> 00:26:44,477
Be that as it may,
she's all our problem now.

479
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:48,317
You're scared of Mary.
Is that it?

480
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,467
You two are really something.

481
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:53,232
There's nothing you wouldn't do
in pursuit of power, is there?

482
00:26:53,272 --> 00:26:55,192
Do what they ask.

483
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:56,803
That's good advice.

484
00:26:56,843 --> 00:26:58,763
Shut the fuck up.

485
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:01,564
Listen.

486
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:02,601
I won't let them hurt you.

487
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:03,599
The people need someone

488
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,560
capable of ruling.

489
00:27:07,748 --> 00:27:11,320
Who else has the stomach
to do what is necessary?

490
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:19,536
All right.

491
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:20,995
Good man.

492
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:22,991
But let me just reiterate,

493
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:24,028
if the power goes to your head

494
00:27:24,068 --> 00:27:26,639
and you develop some kind
of independent streak--

495
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,636
One thing.

496
00:27:28,676 --> 00:27:32,593
If anything happens to her,
I will kill you.

497
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:35,663
<i>Or die trying.</i>

498
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:37,623
I don't doubt it.

499
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:46,570
Don't you understand, hm?

500
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:48,757
The truth will set you free.

501
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:50,908
I-I couldn't agree more.

502
00:27:50,948 --> 00:27:52,558
And that- that's why
you have to believe me.

503
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,403
It- it wasn't me.

504
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:55,055
<i>I was only there</i>
<i>to protect the king.</i>

505
00:27:55,095 --> 00:27:56,821
Catherine, tell- tell her.

506
00:27:56,862 --> 00:27:58,280
Just admit your involvement

507
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,586
and tell us
where to find your brother.

508
00:27:59,627 --> 00:28:02,274
I told you,
I don't know where he is.

509
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,501
Perhaps if we gave him
the proper incentive,

510
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:05,998
he would tell us the truth.

511
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:09,378
What does that mean?

512
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:16,558
Cut off his finger.

513
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,363
- What?
- What?

514
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:20,782
Do not stray
from your path, Mary.

515
00:28:29,117 --> 00:28:29,922
It was her.

516
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:31,687
<i>She was behind it.</i>

517
00:28:31,728 --> 00:28:34,414
Mary, I...
I am not your true enemy.

518
00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:35,489
She planned the whole thing.

519
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:36,372
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

520
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:38,715
A man would say anything
to save his skin.

521
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:40,020
You fucking bitch.

522
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:42,747
Well, I thought you were there
to protect the king.

523
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:43,822
<i>So which is it?</i>

524
00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:44,667
Are you a loyal servant,

525
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:46,894
or were you lead astray
by the Queen Mother?

526
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:50,619
<i>I have one question.</i>

527
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:53,152
Will you hand over your brother

528
00:28:53,193 --> 00:28:55,879
and advise him
to sign the regency over to me?

529
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,761
- You, regent?
<i>- Yes.</i>

530
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:59,604
Did you put her up
to this nonsense?

531
00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:01,716
This is what is best
for France, Louis.

532
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:02,446
<i>Jesus.</i>

533
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:04,634
Do you even know
what the truth is anymore?

534
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,244
If you are dedicated
to the cause,

535
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:10,394
Mary, there is no excess.

536
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:15,232
Yes. Guard.

537
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:16,922
Guard, give me your knife.

538
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,573
No, don't- don't do this.

539
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:19,379
For the last time,

540
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,530
I ask you to tell me
where Antoine is.

541
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,641
I don't know where he is.

542
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:25,946
Promise.

543
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:29,671
The little one.

544
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:31,245
You haven't got the guts.

545
00:29:32,706 --> 00:29:33,779
Hold him down.

546
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,854
No, no, no, no. Don't--

547
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:35,699
Hold him down!

548
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,120
Catherine, please,
for the love of God,

549
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,965
don't do this.

550
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:39,386
Don't do it. Don't--

551
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:41,075
<i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>one last chance.</i>

552
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:43,341
One last chance.

553
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,676
Fuck you.

554
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:01,811
Ah, fuck, fuck!

555
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:07,263
Ah, fuck. Fuck.

556
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:09,490
Fuck, ah!

557
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,908
You're fucking mental.

558
00:30:12,948 --> 00:30:14,252
No, I'm not.

559
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:16,710
I'm just better at this
than you are.

560
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:23,739
And don't you ever forget it.

561
00:30:27,464 --> 00:30:28,114
Bring her.

562
00:30:34,797 --> 00:30:37,522
I heard you have
a friend in trouble.

563
00:30:37,562 --> 00:30:38,674
Perhaps I could help.

564
00:30:40,212 --> 00:30:41,861
And in return?

565
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:45,012
Tell me where to find Antoine.

566
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:47,659
You said you wanted proof

567
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:49,733
that your brother
remained in harm's way

568
00:30:49,774 --> 00:30:52,576
if you don't do as I say.

569
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:56,493
Will that suffice?

570
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:01,329
Oh, my God,
it's his fucking finger.

571
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:04,171
And we will cut
piece after piece

572
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:06,669
after piece of him off...

573
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:08,587
unless you sign.

574
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:12,352
He's gonna be
so disappointed in me.

575
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:14,999
Antoine.

576
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:23,141
I wouldn't.

577
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,406
Hello, Catherine.

578
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:26,596
This is nice, isn't it?

579
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:29,169
It's like
a Privy Council meeting,

580
00:31:29,209 --> 00:31:31,129
but with guns.

581
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:35,660
I think this is the one
you need to sign, cousin.

582
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,080
Montmorency will be regent.

583
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:41,803
Now, hold on just a minute.

584
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:43,684
I do have principles, you know.

585
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:44,298
You don't.

586
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:45,873
<i>I have been entrusted</i>

587
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:47,563
to safeguard the honor

588
00:31:47,603 --> 00:31:48,791
of the royal family of France.

589
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:51,479
I can't just be forced
to sign away the regency

590
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,399
to whomever has the bigger gun.

591
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,511
I don't see why not.

592
00:31:55,551 --> 00:31:56,893
Ah!

593
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,543
What the fuck was that?

594
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:03,114
Ah, fuck.

595
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,456
Come what may,
I will be my own man.

596
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,221
-Sign.
-Stay down!

597
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,335
Stay. Stay down, Francois.

598
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:12,253
<i>Stay with me, okay?</i>
<i>Just stay with me.</i>

599
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,595
<i>It's your leg.</i>

600
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,130
I swear to God, Montmorency,

601
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:17,898
you mark my words.

602
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,242
You and that girl will pay.

603
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:21,430
-I swear!
-We'll see about that.

604
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,771
Well... you still doubt
my conviction?

605
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:39,708
<i>Good boy.</i>

606
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,245
I'm sure Daddy's proud of you.

607
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:42,895
<i>Now, I had him</i>
<i>sign over the regency</i>

608
00:32:42,936 --> 00:32:46,045
to someone who's been
overlooked, underestimated,

609
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:47,849
<i>someone capable</i>
<i>of sacrificing their friends</i>

610
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:50,230
and plotting with their enemies
to rule France.

611
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:53,455
Are you surprised
to see me alive?

612
00:32:53,496 --> 00:32:56,412
I have known you
since you were a child.

613
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:59,100
I've been watching you.

614
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,405
And either because
of your will to survive

615
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:04,399
or because you really are
possessed of a black heart,

616
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:06,396
you are the only one
that can save France

617
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:09,237
from any of these fucking
idiots when they are in charge.

618
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:24,175
All you have to do now
is convince your dying son.

619
00:33:24,216 --> 00:33:26,517
You think you have
the stomach for that?

620
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:34,504
Are you okay?

621
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:36,117
-Did they hurt you?
-I'm all right.

622
00:33:36,158 --> 00:33:39,036
I always knew
I could depend on you.

623
00:33:39,076 --> 00:33:40,802
You've never let me down.

624
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:44,911
I said get out!

625
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:01,461
I did wrong.
I did wrong.

626
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:03,035
- Mary, Mary.
- I did wrong.

627
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:05,569
-I did wrong--the regency.
-Gather yourself.

628
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,298
Tell me, what has happened?

629
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:09,256
I asked Francis
for the regency,

630
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:11,830
like you told me to, and...

631
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:15,016
...he accused me
of all sorts of baseness.

632
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:16,283
He...

633
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:17,128
he said...

634
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:18,855
he said that I wanted him
to be sick,

635
00:34:18,895 --> 00:34:23,118
and worse, that I only ever
loved him for all these years

636
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:24,423
because of his sickness,
for it meant

637
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,305
that I may one day rule
in his stead,

638
00:34:26,345 --> 00:34:27,995
and he...

639
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:30,605
he even said
that I had no interest

640
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:32,641
in performing my wifely duties.

641
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:34,715
Did he offer you the regency
or not?

642
00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:36,212
No, he refused.

643
00:34:36,252 --> 00:34:38,323
And I begged
for his forgiveness for asking,

644
00:34:38,364 --> 00:34:41,857
but he would grant me
no such peace.

645
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:44,852
- Oh, Mary, Mary, Mary.
- I...

646
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:47,194
Mary, shh.

647
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:48,308
Calm yourself.

648
00:34:48,348 --> 00:34:48,922
Yes.

649
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,418
-Go and calm yourself.
-Mm.

650
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:54,413
I will talk to him,
and I will make this right.

651
00:34:54,454 --> 00:34:57,257
Yes, because he...

652
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:59,060
he must always know

653
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,515
that I have had
his best interests at heart.

654
00:35:02,556 --> 00:35:04,859
We all do.

655
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:30,511
My son...

656
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:41,145
Is it true the Bourbons
plotted to kidnap me

657
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:44,449
and now I must break
the chain of succession?

658
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:49,784
It is what is best
for the country.

659
00:35:49,825 --> 00:35:52,741
I am sorry I have not
understood your true nature

660
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:54,239
until now.

661
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:57,889
But how can you
understand anything now?

662
00:35:58,196 --> 00:36:01,919
They say one sees clearest
when one is closest to death.

663
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,261
Perhaps you won't die.

664
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:05,721
The doctors
have been wrong before.

665
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:07,950
No, no.

666
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:15,706
What's that you've got?

667
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:32,295
Antoine has agreed to sign
his regency over to you?

668
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:35,750
Why would he do that?

669
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:40,704
I persuaded him.

670
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,198
And now you must persuade me.

671
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:56,370
You're in great pain,
aren't you?

672
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,330
<i>Oh, Mother...</i>

673
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:01,593
Why does it
have to hurt so much?

674
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:05,126
I accommodated myself to death.

675
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:07,390
I always knew
it would come early for me,

676
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,081
but the pain...

677
00:37:08,122 --> 00:37:10,807
<i>I have never felt</i>
<i>anything like the pain.</i>

678
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:14,073
Shh, shh.

679
00:37:15,993 --> 00:37:19,447
You are the strongest person
I have ever known,

680
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,440
to live with the suffering
that you have endured.

681
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:25,516
Do you know that?

682
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:41,068
I have something here...

683
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:46,636
...that will take
your pain away.

684
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,357
You simply have to take a sip.

685
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,811
<i>But if you do,</i>

686
00:37:55,851 --> 00:37:59,154
it will be an end of this life.

687
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:02,147
<i>And I fear giving this to you</i>

688
00:38:02,188 --> 00:38:05,836
takes more strength
than I possess.

689
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:20,194
Give it to me, please, Mother.

690
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,110
<i>Please give it to me.</i>

691
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:45,001
My child...

692
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:55,407
And now you must rest.

693
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:00,706
Peace awaits.

694
00:39:31,274 --> 00:39:36,379
And now I will leave you
to live with your choices.

695
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:45,672
Shh, shh, rest.

696
00:39:45,712 --> 00:39:47,784
Just rest.

697
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:50,970
Shh, rest.

698
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:33,250
Oh, fuck.

699
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:36,704
Fuck.

700
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:00,398
<i>Hear ye, hear ye!</i>

701
00:41:00,898 --> 00:41:02,431
-Louis of Bourbon...
-Fucking move!

702
00:41:02,472 --> 00:41:04,275
<i>...Second Prince of the Blood,</i>

703
00:41:04,315 --> 00:41:07,347
is pardoned
for the crime of treason.

704
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:07,885
What?

705
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:09,766
<i>The king is dead.</i>

706
00:41:09,806 --> 00:41:13,107
<i>Long live the new king</i>
<i>by order of the new regent,</i>

707
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:14,796
Her Majesty Queen Catherine.

708
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:21,286
Then the king is dead,

709
00:41:21,326 --> 00:41:25,050
and my mother-in-law has taken
the regency for herself.

710
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,005
She has made a fool of me.

711
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,270
Fuck off.

712
00:41:37,223 --> 00:41:38,911
I shouldn't have
signed away the regency

713
00:41:38,952 --> 00:41:40,639
under any circumstances,
should I?

714
00:41:42,445 --> 00:41:43,903
No.

715
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:48,587
I... I...

716
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:50,200
No, I... I will...

717
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,119
I will write to my cousin
Queen Elizabeth in England,

718
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,502
and when she hears that some...

719
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:56,805
some commoner has stolen
the throne of France,

720
00:41:56,845 --> 00:41:58,264
she will be moved to help me.

721
00:41:58,304 --> 00:41:58,955
I'm sure of it.

722
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,144
I'm sure, despite our...

723
00:42:01,184 --> 00:42:02,604
our differences.

724
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:06,866
But first, we must all
be united in our task.

725
00:42:06,906 --> 00:42:08,479
The fuck...

726
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:09,784
Uncle?

727
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:11,359
<i>Will you back me now?</i>

728
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:12,779
Yes.

729
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:14,776
Anything to oppose Catherine.

730
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:16,734
The Bourbon
Princes of the Blood,

731
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:17,964
are you with me?

732
00:42:20,422 --> 00:42:21,342
Am I with you?

733
00:42:21,382 --> 00:42:23,109
Are... are you fucking joking?

734
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:24,069
My granddaughter has vision.

735
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:27,217
The sanctity of the rules
of succession are at stake.

736
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:29,176
<i>Do you really have a choice?</i>

737
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,436
I'll think about it.

738
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:38,429
Let's go.

739
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,927
<i>I'm starving.</i>

740
00:42:42,386 --> 00:42:43,461
<i>You'll be all right.</i>

741
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:44,958
<i>Oh, no, I'm fucked.</i>

742
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:46,609
<i>The finger...</i>

743
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:47,838
<i>Finger's gone.</i>

744
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:52,254
<i>Once you were regent,</i>

745
00:42:52,294 --> 00:42:54,174
<i>you moved the court</i>
<i>to Chenonceaux,</i>

746
00:42:54,214 --> 00:42:57,744
<i>where you could keep</i>
<i>a better eye on your enemies.</i>

747
00:42:57,785 --> 00:42:59,511
<i>You only needed</i>
<i>one final piece</i>

748
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:02,546
<i>to seal your victory</i>
<i>against Mary.</i>

749
00:43:03,238 --> 00:43:04,580
<i>I'm sorry, I can't help you.</i>

750
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,730
Please, I just...
I have no one.

751
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,613
And I have nowhere to go.

752
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:08,919
And I just- I just don't know
what to--

753
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,340
All right, all right,
don't cry.

754
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,759
Let me ask the cook
if she needs another maid.

755
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,988
Thank you.

756
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,935
Then when you found me...

757
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,160
you didn't waste any time,

758
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,888
because you knew Mary
had sent a letter

759
00:43:27,928 --> 00:43:31,037
to her cousin
Queen Elizabeth of England.

760
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,686
Make sure this finds its way

761
00:43:33,727 --> 00:43:36,067
to my cousin
Queen Elizabeth of England.

762
00:43:36,107 --> 00:43:38,755
Move posthaste
and let nothing delay you.

763
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:42,863
<i>A letter, I am guessing,</i>

764
00:43:42,904 --> 00:43:45,552
<i>that never found its way</i>
<i>to its recipient,</i>

765
00:43:45,592 --> 00:43:47,779
<i>but could be used</i>
<i>to trick Mary</i>

766
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:50,505
<i>and get rid of her</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

767
00:43:58,994 --> 00:44:02,102
You carry an important message.

768
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:04,367
How could you know that?

769
00:44:04,407 --> 00:44:05,404
There.

770
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:06,364
Would you like it?

771
00:44:06,404 --> 00:44:09,552
<i>It's good luck</i>
<i>for your travels.</i>

772
00:44:09,592 --> 00:44:11,548
Do you want me
to tell you your future?

773
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:15,196
<i>First, you made sure</i>
<i>to win my trust,</i>

774
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,579
<i>so when you asked me,</i>

775
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,460
<i>I would go to Mary's chambers</i>
<i>to search</i>

776
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,494
<i>for evidence of treachery</i>
<i>that did not exist.</i>

777
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:25,334
<i>And then you made sure</i>
<i>I would despise you,</i>

778
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:27,829
<i>all to make Mary believe</i>
<i>that the letter</i>

779
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,711
she asked me to steal from you

780
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:33,821
<i>was an authentic reply</i>
<i>from her cousin.</i>

781
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:36,316
Though now I know this letter

782
00:44:36,356 --> 00:44:38,274
asking Mary
to return to Scotland

783
00:44:38,314 --> 00:44:42,574
and join forces with Elizabeth
to dethrone you...

784
00:44:42,615 --> 00:44:43,727
is a forgery.

785
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:46,376
<i>I found the replica</i>
<i>of Queen Elizabeth's seal</i>

786
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:47,528
<i>in your magician's camp.</i>

787
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:51,946
The sight of him watching us
on our ride made me suspicious.

788
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,556
You are very clever.

789
00:44:56,055 --> 00:44:57,975
That's why I chose you.

790
00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:01,853
<i>So now that you know...</i>

791
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,384
...are you with me
or against me?

792
00:45:08,228 --> 00:45:11,338
First, I want to know.

793
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,444
You sacrificed
your best friend,

794
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:17,558
your husband,

795
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:20,323
your son...

796
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,587
...for power?

797
00:45:25,776 --> 00:45:27,696
No.

798
00:45:28,848 --> 00:45:30,998
For freedom.

799
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,720
In that case,

800
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:39,062
I am with you.

801
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,630
Here are my terms.

802
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:52,615
Thought you couldn't read.

803
00:45:52,655 --> 00:45:55,765
There's lots of things
you don't know about me.

804
00:45:56,956 --> 00:45:58,951
A title?

805
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:00,912
Property?

806
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,980
<i>A little education</i>
<i>is a dangerous thing.</i>

807
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,247
Apparently.

808
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,469
Feels good to be bad,
doesn't it?

809
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:16,194
Feels better
to get my own back.

810
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:19,457
Exactly.

811
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:53,324
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary...

812
00:46:53,364 --> 00:46:55,782
we must prepare
to depart at once.

813
00:46:58,126 --> 00:47:01,004
Oh, my cousin has answered
my call for aid!

814
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:07,301
Safe travels.

815
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:09,914
History will remember you.

816
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,141
Come!

817
00:47:17,403 --> 00:47:19,206
I wouldn't count on it.

818
00:47:40,365 --> 00:47:44,050
I will not let anything
happen to you.

819
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,586
What could happen to me?

820
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,120
Precisely.

821
00:48:37,311 --> 00:48:40,114
Looks like all is forgiven?

822
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:41,917
I wouldn't say so.

823
00:48:41,957 --> 00:48:44,720
But I imagine she realizes
she cannot govern

824
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:47,754
without women like me
on her side.

825
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:53,207
And I intend to dedicate myself
to her cause.

826
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,359
Well, that's that then.

827
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:56,893
Checkmate.

828
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,199
On the contrary.

829
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,002
I will spend the rest
of my life getting back at her

830
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:02,346
for what she did to us.

831
00:49:03,653 --> 00:49:04,880
<i>But in the meantime,</i>

832
00:49:04,921 --> 00:49:08,412
we shall convince her
we are her closest allies.

833
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,679
My homeland.

834
00:50:02,443 --> 00:50:04,091
Greetings.

835
00:50:04,132 --> 00:50:06,088
Your queen has returned.

836
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:09,238
Uh, Queen Mary,
what are you doing here?

837
00:50:09,278 --> 00:50:12,233
My cousin wrote to me saying
that she would help me

838
00:50:12,273 --> 00:50:13,461
in my time of need.

839
00:50:13,502 --> 00:50:15,305
Has she not yet arrived?

840
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,033
Surely, you know
your cousin Elizabeth

841
00:50:17,073 --> 00:50:19,605
would not tolerate
your presence on British soil.

842
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:22,331
She will see it
as a threat to her rule.

843
00:50:22,372 --> 00:50:23,253
But her letter said that--

844
00:50:23,293 --> 00:50:24,905
- Her... her letter?
- Yes.

845
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:26,901
If there was such a letter,

846
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:29,589
I'm... I'm sure
you've been fooled by forgery,

847
00:50:29,629 --> 00:50:30,741
Your Majesty.

848
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:35,848
So it was Catherine
who triumphed after all.

849
00:50:35,888 --> 00:50:37,460
And to think, just a week ago,

850
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,648
you had them all
right where you wanted them.

851
00:50:40,688 --> 00:50:43,144
Now she promises
to make tolerance

852
00:50:43,184 --> 00:50:44,219
the new law of the land

853
00:50:44,259 --> 00:50:47,598
and break the treaty
with the Holy Roman emperor.

854
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:50,747
No official religion at all.

855
00:50:50,787 --> 00:50:53,089
<i>They will blame you</i>
<i>and your brother.</i>

856
00:50:53,129 --> 00:50:55,355
Mother, when will you shut up?

857
00:50:55,395 --> 00:50:56,622
Isn't it obvious?

858
00:50:56,662 --> 00:50:59,847
When you do something
to shut me up.

859
00:51:08,989 --> 00:51:10,637
Thank you for your loyalty.

860
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:21,006
Keep in mind,
you will only have my loyalty

861
00:51:21,046 --> 00:51:23,809
if you can protect
the people I care about.

862
00:51:33,986 --> 00:51:35,406
<i>Allow me.</i>

863
00:52:07,086 --> 00:52:09,583
Trust no one.
