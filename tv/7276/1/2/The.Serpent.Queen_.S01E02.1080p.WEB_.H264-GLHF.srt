I know you know all sorts
of things about animals.

169

Henri,
about our wedding night...

00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,782
What about it?

171
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:55,480
I found it...

172
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:57,352
most enjoyable.

173
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:04,968
- Really?
- I've missed you.

174
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:07,362
Perhaps we could take
another walk soon?

Perhaps.

176
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,634
Hey, that could have killed us!

177
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,028
Hey, but it didn't, did it?

178
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:23,247
Your brother
is most disagreeable.

179
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:24,858
My brother is the dauphin.

180
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,385
He's the first in line
to the throne,

181
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:27,664
and he'll one day be your king.

00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,039

- I wouldn't say "abject."
- Yes, Your Majesty.

229
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:47,261
What did you have in mind?

230
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:51,047
Well, burn a Protestant
village, Your Majesty.

231
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:53,745
Kill 1,000,
women and children included.

232
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,400
That sort of thing tends to get
the message across, I find.

233
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,315
Yes, uh...

234
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,143
make an example
of a few, of course,

235
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,580
but I suggest another approach...

236
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:06,628
An olive branch to stave off
any further insurrection.

237
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:10,893
Princess Adelaide of Prussia
has reached marriageable age.

238
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:13,287
Her family is known to be
sympathetic to Protestants

239
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,463
and their cause.

240
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:17,726
Perhaps a new match
for the future king of France?

241
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,294
Ooh.

242
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:22,296
She might have grown
into a pretty one.

243
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,254
- Eh, mon fils?
- Possibly.

244
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:27,257
Your Majesty, I fear whether
Protestants are appeased

245
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:28,844
or threatened
makes little difference.

246
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,870
Until there is systemic change,

247
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,133
some pretense
of religious freedom,

248
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,004
they'll continue
to cause trouble.

249
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,572
Oh, well, I don't think
systemic change is necessary.

250
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:40,618
A-a mere symbol would suffice.

251
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,031
Besides, the king
has more pressing matters

252
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,317
- to attend to.
- Mm.

253
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,796
Like the sultan.

254
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,078
It's been a month
since the wedding,

255
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:47,451

Well, then
I will tell him myself!

260
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,437
- You will do no such thing!
- Sir.

261
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,901
When the weather gets cold,

262
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:01,161
he'll probably leave
of his own accord anyway.

Why don't you just have him
move in with us permanently,

The wedding guest

307
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:19,710
Your stepmother
doesn't like him much.

308
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,388
No.

309
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:24,652
My father does, though.

310

He admires him
'cause he's cruel in battle,

311
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,265
and that's the quality
he admires most in a man.

Mm.

313
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,616
Probably why he prefers
my brother to me.

314
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,969
When we were children...

315
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,407
my father was captured in Pavia
by the Holy Roman Emperor,

316
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:42,887
and in order
to secure his release,

317
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:46,804
he offered me and my brothers
as hostages in his place.

318
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,372
What? Really?

319
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,779
Well, yeah, and then he didn't
keep his side of the treaty,

320
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:54,160
so we were kept there
for three years.

321
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,253
Thing was, everyone back home
admired him for his toughness.

322
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,953
Everyone except my mother.

323
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,563
She died of grief.

324
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,480
He says I remind him of her,
which is...

325
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,832
If your father cannot accept
the more sensitive side

326
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:17,183
of your nature, the loss is his.

327
