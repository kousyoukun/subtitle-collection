1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,240
MasterChef is back, searching for the country's best amateur cook.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,640
Come on!

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,280
You can't say it's got chilli in, and not make it chilli.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,560
Don't, don't, don't, don't! Oh, no!

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,960
Each week, 16 new contestants battle for a place

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,120
in Friday's quarterfinal.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,600
It's a masterpiece.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,280
Only the best will make it through to the final challenges.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,480
You don't slow down.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,240
Everybody, pudding!

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,120
Absolutely beautiful.

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,240
It's an incredible piece of cooking.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,360
They want to realise one dream, and that's become

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,920
the MasterChef champion.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Kid in a sweet shop, that's me.

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,440
Let's find the stars.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,400
These eight amateurs all think they've got what it takes

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,280
to become MasterChef champion.

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,520
But at the end of today's heat,

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,120
only three will make it through to Friday's quarterfinal.

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,680
Cooking for John and Gregg scares me a little bit.

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,400
If I can put a smile on their face, that would absolutely make me day.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,920
I might not be up to their standard, but I want to test myself,

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,200
and see whether I can cook or not.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,440
I think I'm like a swan, you know.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,680
Nice and calm on top, but my legs are going ten to the dozen

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,240
underneath the water.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,080
I believe I'm good enough to win MasterChef.

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,440
I can do it. I will do it.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,240
Welcome to the MasterChef kitchen.

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,160
Welcome to a brand-new competition.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,440
A fantastic opportunity for you to indulge what I hope

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,600
is your greatest passion.

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,640
This could be the start of something truly amazing.

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,200
Your first test is the market test.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,120
We have done something very special this year.

37
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,960
We've built you a market...

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,600
..and it's stocked full of extraordinary produce.

39
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,080
All we want you to do is to go to the market, collect some ingredients,

40
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,680
and come back and cook for us one dish.

41
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,560
One great dish that shows Gregg and I you've got the potential to go

42
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,640
further in the competition.

43
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Ladies and gentlemen, select your ingredients, off you go.

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,160
The contestants now have ten minutes to plan their dish,

45
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,000
but can revisit the market at any time.

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,120
Today's ingredients include

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,360
pork mince,

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,240
chicken breasts,

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,560
pancetta,

50
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,480
halibut and mussels.

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,560
There's also a range of cheeses, grains and pulses,

52
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,440
and a selection of fruit and vegetables.

53
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,600
There's too many ingredients to choose from.

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,240
There's absolutely loads, so, I just don't know where to start.

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
It puts you under the pressure, that's for sure.

56
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,000
I guess it shows that you're a cook, if you can come up with something.

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,440
We're about to find out whether they can really cook or not.

58
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,480
They need to think outside the box.

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,280
Be bold, be brave.

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,520
- That's it. 
- You can't play it safe.

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,920
It's the variety that catches you off-guard, having so much to pick from.

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,800
You've things going through your mind that you've never thought about.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,480
But, here we are, we're going to make it happen.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,240
I know how to do sweet pastry,

65
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,120
and I think everybody else is going savoury.

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,360
So I want to do something a bit different.

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,640
Right, we hope you've chosen well.

68
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,120
You have one hour and 20 minutes to cook for us one dish.

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,080
At the end of this,

70
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,480
three of you will be going home.

71
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,360
Ladies and gentlemen, let's cook.

72
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,640
Travel agent Richard lives in Rochdale

73
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,760
with his wife and three children.

74
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,000
Cooking for John and Gregg, yeah, it's a bit nerve-racking.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,080
But then, I have three little critics at home, you know,

76
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,920
so it'll be a bit different.

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,280
If they like my first dish, it'd be amazing.

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,720
I'd be on cloud nine.

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,280
Today I'm doing a mushroom ravioli...

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,760
..with a sage butter.

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,040
You're comfortable with making pasta?

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,760
I am, yeah, I make it a lot at home.

83
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,560
I make it with the kids, so...

84
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,000
If it all goes to plan, like it does at home, then it should be OK.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,520
But I've not got the kids with me today, throwing stuff in.

86
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,040
Only three component parts.

87
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,480
The pasta, the filling and the butter sauce.

88
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,800
Which means all three things have to be absolutely perfect.

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,720
31-year-old Solomon is a retired professional footballer

90
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,400
and now coaches for a living.

91
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
My love of food always came from when I was younger.

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,320
My mum was a single parent, she was out working all the time,

93
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,280
so I had to really cook for myself.

94
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,640
And I really enjoy it.

95
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,520
What are you going to cook for us, now?

96
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,400
I'm going to cook a pasta with a tomatoey sauce, herby,

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,480
and I'm going to get some herby chicken on top of it as well.

98
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,680
As you know, as footballers, we've got the pre-match,

99
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,520
and that consists of pasta and chicken.

100
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,240
It's probably the most boring food.

101
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,320
It becomes boring because you eat it so much, but you need the energy.

102
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,480
But I'm having to kind of

103
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,560
make it look a bit more glamorous than I do at home.

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,960
But I'm going to go for it.

105
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
What he wants to do is to take his boring, everyday fodder -

106
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,640
his chicken and pasta - and zhoosh it up.

107
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,600
Great. But he's not even making pasta, he's using dried pasta.

108
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,240
At least Solomon's cooking something he knows.

109
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,840
30 minutes are gone.

110
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,720
As well as learning to become a pilot,

111
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,320
web developer Lewis loves to experiment with his food.

112
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,320
I think I'm going to try and do a mix of classic cooking

113
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,480
and also throwing in some elements here and there that are, yeah,

114
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,640
I guess, testing the brief.

115
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,880
I have tried my hand at chocolate lasagne...

116
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,920
..and the "chomelette", the chocolate omelette.

117
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,360
Both of which, I would say, have not been repeat meals.

118
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,640
Have you got a dish in mind?

119
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,800
Gnocchi in a gorgonzola and bacon and mushroom sauce,

120
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,000
and perhaps some pickled mushrooms, depending on how they come out.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What's in this mushroom? Apple and...?

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,960
Apple, vinegar,

123
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
sugar, a bit of olive oil.

124
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
I think it'll come together, hopefully.

125
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,400
Does Gorgonzola and gnocchi really belong with a pickled mushroom

126
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,960
and some apple?

127
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,640
I'm not quite sure.

128
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,120
35-year-old Kelly works as a call-centre manager

129
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
for the Inland Revenue.

130
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,320
Competitive, everyone who knows me would say ridiculously competitive.

131
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,840
It doesn't matter whether it's a board game, a card game,

132
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
whether it's a computer game.

133
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,280
Anything, I like to win.

134
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,120
Kelly, you've got a nice smile, are you enjoying yourself?

135
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
No, it's a nervous smile.

136
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,400
And I'm having a bit of a hot sweat at the minute.

137
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
What are you making?

138
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,520
Erm, chicken and bacon risotto.

139
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,280
That's the plan.

140
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,920
Which rice are you using?

141
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,480
Well, I got that,

142
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,960
because although I had chicken and bacon risotto in my head,

143
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,560
- that's what I was going to use. 
- Risotto from Italy, and this rice,

144
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,040
with Spanish writing on, is risotto rice?

145
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,280
- I'm hoping so. 
- I think that may well be paella rice.

146
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,760
Now, the problem is, risotto is about adding stock to rice,

147
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,240
and stirring it and stirring it,

148
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,480
and all the rice plumps up and it becomes wonderful.

149
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,000
Paella, on the other hand, is about baking the rice,

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,280
and all the water being soaked up without being agitated.

151
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,240
If you stir paella rice, it turns to mush.

152
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,560
Is there, like, no risotto rice at all?

153
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,480
I still wanted to do risotto.

154
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,080
I don't know whether to get...

155
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't know.

156
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
So, is she going to make a paella,

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,600
or is she going to try and risk making a risotto with paella rice?

158
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,440
I'm just going to stick with me gut.

159
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,120
I think it tastes all right,

160
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,400
but whether he's going to have an issue with the rice...

161
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,600
You've got 30 minutes left, all right?

162
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,680
Timers are beeping, it's all a-working, it's all a-go.

163
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,800
The MasterChef kitchen is alive once more.

164
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,000
29-year-old Jamie works in marketing,

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,680
selling wines from all over Europe.

166
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,280
I think my palate is going to stand me in good stead,

167
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,280
because I've tasted wine for six, seven years,

168
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,840
and you start to think about the complexities of flavour,

169
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,040
and I think it's really transferable.

170
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,400
Jamie's a champion of wine, and he's championing wine, that's for sure.

171
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,160
He's got half a bottle of Rioja poaching one breast of chicken,

172
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,400
and I think that sounds good.

173
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,920
I'm going for, I guess, a sort of Spanish coq au vin thing.

174
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,600
You could call it a "Rioja coq", actually.

175
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,240
Just trying to capture the flavours of Spain, really.

176
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,360
When you eat, you should just be in the moment,

177
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,080
you should be lost in those flavours.

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,640
American-born Maria splits her time between London,

179
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,160
New York and Thailand.

180
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,480
Why do you love to cook?

181
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,160
Because it's an art form, for me.

182
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,280
I'm an interior designer, I'm an artist,

183
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,240
I design jewellery, clothing.

184
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,280
So, just for me, it's another art form.

185
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,480
Would you say you had a style?

186
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,760
The world is my style.

187
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,120
I've gone for halibut, which I've cooked before many times,

188
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,360
but I've gone Thai-style.

189
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,720
I spend lots of time there, in Thailand, in Samui,

190
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
because my boyfriend lives over there.

191
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,680
So I love their flavours

192
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,760
and they've influenced my cooking a lot.

193
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,920
There's little gems floating in the pan there, of garlic, chillies,

194
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,960
spring onions, lemon grass - beautiful.

195
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,800
Is it a broth? I'm not quite sure.

196
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,840
The intention, I think, is great.

197
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,280
You have 15 minutes left.

198
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,040
Tariq's love of cooking started when he got a pasta machine

199
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,680
for Christmas, aged 11.

200
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,800
I haven't really got one favourite style of food,

201
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,280
I love cooking all styles, all different cuisines.

202
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,520
I did quite a bit of travelling last year, so,

203
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,280
I went to India and south-east Asia,

204
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,240
so now that's a big influence, as well.

205
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,800
Tariq has decided to do us a Thai dish.

206
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,680
A Thai dish which includes minced pork, aubergines,

207
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
tomato ketchup and honey.

208
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,680
There was just so much choice in that pantry,

209
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,640
I didn't know what to choose.

210
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,880
Was there anything left in the market?

211
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,240
No, not really, not after I'd been in there!

212
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,440
Bristol-based Leanne works for the NHS,

213
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,280
negotiating contracts for the blood and transplant teams.

214
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,920
My job is very demanding, but I really enjoy what I do.

215
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,120
So when I get home, the chance to cook is really my detox,

216
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,600
my relaxation.

217
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,360
Leanne's plan is solid.

218
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360
A tart case, a lemon curd in the middle,

219
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,080
a blackberry sauce.

220
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,440
As long as everything is flavoured well, it's going to be fantastic.

221
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,640
- Who do you cook for? 
- Mostly my husband.

222
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,520
And how well does he think you'll do on here?

223
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,280
The rule was, I'm not allowed to cry or drop anything,

224
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,640
that was the...

225
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,440
SHE GIGGLES

226
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,440
That was basically the pep talk, don't cry or drop anything,

227
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,960
and it'll be all right.

228
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,920
What is that?

229
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,240
Some kind of mushroom jelly.

230
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,080
Five minutes left.

231
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,360
I'm not completely happy whether the flavours will come through.

232
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,720
30 seconds.

233
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,560
Time's up! Stop.

234
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,640
I did a risotto with paella rice.

235
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,840
- Did that not work? 
- Well, I've done it but it's just...

236
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,720
First up is travel agent Richard.

237
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,760
His home-made ravioli has been stuffed with mushrooms

238
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,440
and ricotta cheese

239
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,200
and served with a sage butter and truffle shavings.

240
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,800
I like that a great deal.

241
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,280
Your pasta is really fine and light and thin.

242
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,920
Strength of mushroom, truffle, cheese, slippery,

243
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,520
butter sauce. Well done.

244
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,640
Technically, really good.

245
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,360
Flavour, perfect.

246
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,720
Thank you.

247
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,320
I couldn't stop shaking.

248
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,000
But, yeah, I feel great.

249
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,520
I got good feedback so that's what I wanted.

250
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,640
Well done, that's brilliant.

251
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,680
Football coach Solomon's tagliatelle

252
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,480
has been served in a tomato and basil sauce

253
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,680
with chicken and bacon, alongside garlic toast.

254
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,720
It's a shame you've used dried pasta because I'd have liked to have seen you make your own pasta.

255
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,920
I don't like the sauce, I have to say, I find it strong and sweet,

256
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,760
like tomato puree.

257
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,680
What you've done here, Solomon, I think, is made a crowd pleaser.

258
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,400
It's what people cook at home all the time.

259
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,360
The question is, has it demonstrated enough skill on MasterChef?

260
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,880
I think the situation caught me off guard.

261
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,440
I wanted to go for something I knew instead of trying to be too...

262
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,600
Show too much razzmatazz.

263
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,480
Scrutiny. I'm used to being scrutinised, though.

264
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,440
Web developer Lewis has made potato gnocchi served in a Gorgonzola

265
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,600
and bacon sauce with a pickled mushroom jelly and wilted spinach.

266
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,600
That gnocchi and the Gorgonzola is really, really tasty.

267
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,880
It's salty, it's rich from the cream, loads of parsley,

268
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,440
crispy bits of bacon, and the really lovely chewy bits of gnocchi.

269
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,640
You've got a salty, strong mushroom flavour in a jelly texture.

270
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,240
That's about as crazy as it gets.

271
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,160
But I kind of like that, that sort of inventiveness.

272
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,400
Thanks.

273
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
So elated that that is over.

274
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,000
That was something else, going in front of them,

275
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,960
just an amazing experience and, er...

276
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,720
Yeah, phew!

277
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,200
Civil servant Kelly stuck to her guns

278
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,360
and used paella rice to make her chicken and bacon risotto.

279
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,080
I think what you did is you found a dish in your head and you went,

280
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,680
I'm making risotto and the thing with risotto,

281
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,280
you need the risotto rice, that's a big thing.

282
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,960
Paella rice starts to fall apart and become very, very starchy.

283
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,240
Mm.

284
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,480
The problem I've got is the flavour you've got in there tastes a lot like white wine.

285
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,760
It's very sweet and it's quite acidic.

286
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,360
That's too strong of white wine.

287
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,600
Wine marketer Jamie poached his chicken breast in Rioja

288
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,480
and served it with tomatoes, spring onions,

289
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,360
crispy chicken skin, croutons,

290
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,160
pomme puree and a red wine sauce.

291
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
You've got lovely citrus flavour on the chicken

292
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,760
but the sauce is so strong and powerful of red wine,

293
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,400
it's completely smashed any citrus flavour on the chicken.

294
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,760
Your mashed potato puree is full of butter

295
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
and really delicious

296
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,960
but I don't want mashed potato with the crunch of a crouton.

297
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,960
I think you've shown lots of skill,

298
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,480
I think you've tried to do lots of things but it hasn't resulted

299
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,240
in a delicious plate of food.

300
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,080
I guess neither of them were completely sold on what I was doing.

301
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,400
Yeah, I take something good out of it and I take some bad out of it.

302
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,360
Designer Maria oven baked her halibut

303
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,080
and served it on a bed of spinach with cubed potatoes,

304
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,720
mussels and a broth made from coconut milk,

305
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,360
lemon grass, chilli and ginger.

306
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,000
Your fish is cooked really, really nicely.

307
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,440
Your sauce has good intent but it needs more power.

308
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,320
Cos the fish can stand up to it.

309
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,560
OK.

310
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,320
In my humble opinion,

311
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,120
there is no place for those sweet tomatoes and those potatoes

312
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,000
in that dish. The rest of it, I think is an absolute triumph.

313
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,720
Thanks.

314
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,280
I feel pretty good. I did pretty much what I was planning on doing.

315
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,080
Of course there were some minor things and I realised after,

316
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,560
"Oh, my god, what did I do?"

317
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,120
But, yeah, it wasn't a bad result.

318
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,720
Yeah.

319
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,200
Account manager Tariq

320
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,720
flavoured his pork mince with soy,

321
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,480
lemon grass, ginger,

322
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,640
tomato ketchup and honey

323
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,600
and served it with aubergines,

324
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,080
basmati rice and crispy fried egg,

325
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,200
topped with chilli and spring onion.

326
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,720
It's a big, bold, courageous dish.

327
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,720
The pork is cooked well but honey and ketchup and soy?

328
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,160
I mean, that's really sweet - really, really sweet.

329
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,640
The whole thing is slightly confused

330
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,360
and I think if you are going to be cooking Asian food,

331
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,840
and you've got the ingredients in your market, use them.

332
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,400
I think I just went for too many elements maybe

333
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,760
and mixed up fusion a little bit too much.

334
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,840
It would be nice to get a second chance and show them what I can do.

335
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,320
Last up is NHS worker Leanne

336
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,720
who was the only contestant to have made a dessert.

337
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,880
A lemon curd tart with poached blackberries

338
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,400
and a Mascarpone cream.

339
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,520
I spy with my little eye, something beginning with

340
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,760
absolutely love that pudding, when can we eat it?

341
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,480
Your pastry is lovely and fine and buttery.

342
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,840
Your berries have still got a crunch but the jam round the outside works

343
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,480
very, very nicely. Yeah, very good, great first round, Leanne.

344
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,160
Thank you ever so much.

345
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,240
Your curd is just divine.

346
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,680
The blackberries in the jam are absolutely delicious.

347
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,160
Super job.

348
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,640
Super, super job.

349
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,520
I think it worked really well.

350
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,160
They seemed to really enjoy it so I'm really pleased.

351
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,320
Yay!

352
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,040
That's a pretty good standard,

353
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,200
bearing in mind that they had no idea what they were going to cook.

354
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,000
I think we've got a couple of standout cooks here.

355
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,200
I really like Leanne.

356
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,880
John, it was faultless.

357
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,480
Delicious.

358
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,960
Delicious. What a great cook.

359
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,160
Yes, many may say you're biased because you like a pud,

360
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,960
but I have to say that Leanne's dish was the best of the day.

361
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,520
Leanne goes through.

362
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,320
Well, Leanne goes through for sure. For me, then, it's Maria.

363
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,200
The piece of fish was cooked beautifully.

364
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,840
Really beautiful. And then we got a really lovely plate of ravioli

365
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,520
from Richard and he got every single part absolutely right.

366
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,200
I really liked the gnocchi from Lewis.

367
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,520
I like the creativity, I like the ambition,

368
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,440
I'd like to see Lewis cook again.

369
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,400
As to the other four, three are going.

370
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,320
From Kelly, we got a rice-porridge risotto,

371
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,960
paella, chicken-bacon thing.

372
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,480
And it wasn't very good.

373
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,560
Solomon's chicken was nicely cooked but that's where it ended, really.

374
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,040
So that means Kelly and Solomon go home

375
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,400
but then we've got Tariq and we've also got Jamie.

376
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,680
We have to take a gamble on one of them.

377
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,440
If I do go through,

378
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,240
I'll be wanting to impress them a lot more than I have done today.

379
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,280
So fingers crossed, but I don't know, we'll see what happens.

380
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,000
The positive side of me would say,

381
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
you've got enough good stuff to maybe sneak through

382
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,600
and the other side of my brain says, it's not good enough.

383
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,320
Three of you are leaving us.

384
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,360
The first person leaving us...

385
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,280
is Kelly.

386
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,720
- Thanks very much, Kelly. 
- Thank you.

387
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,000
The second person leaving us

388
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,560
is Solomon.

389
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,720
- Thanks very much, Solomon. 
- Good luck, guys. 
- Thank you.

390
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,560
The third person leaving the competition...

391
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
..is Tariq.

392
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,480
- Thanks very much, Tariq. 
- Thank you.

393
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,160
I'll probably beat myself up for quite a while but I've enjoyed it.

394
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,120
You've only really got yourself to blame when you know the standard that's out there.

395
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,760
I should never have went as safe as I did.

396
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,400
I think at the end of the day, the nerves just completely,

397
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,600
completely got the better of me, so...

398
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,240
Now, you've earned the right to cook your own food.

399
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,520
Food that you've had a chance to practise.

400
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,480
But it's not as simple as that.

401
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,000
You're not just going to cook for John and me,

402
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,360
you are going to cook for last year's final three.

403
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,000
The winner, Jane, and the two runners-up, Billy and Jack.

404
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,360
Two courses in one hour and 15 minutes

405
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,400
and four plates of each course.

406
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,680
Your choice, whether it's a starter and a main course

407
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,520
or a main course and a dessert.

408
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,640
Get it right, you become a quarterfinalist.

409
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,840
Ladies and gentlemen, let's cook.

410
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,640
I don't think I can improve much because I think I did really well.

411
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,880
I just need to... You know, I've raised the bar for myself

412
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,960
and I need to try to keep it as high as I can, you know?

413
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,680
- Richard. 
- Yes? 
- Lovely bit of fish on your bench.

414
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,240
What are your two courses?

415
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,680
A herb-encrusted baked cod with a pea puree and mashed potato.

416
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,600
For dessert, a lemon baked tart.

417
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Is it not a gamble at this stage of the competition to actually bake a

418
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,160
tart, then bake the filling and then hope it's cool enough to cut it into portion size?

419
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,800
- Yeah. 
- In an hour and 15 minutes?

420
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,840
It is. You've got to push yourself, haven't you?

421
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,160
My go-to is white fleshy fish and something green.

422
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,960
And that's definitely what I'm doing,

423
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,360
something white and something green.

424
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,640
My first course is a warm mushroom Asian salad

425
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,680
and my main course is a baked hake with a miso sauce and sushi rice.

426
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,000
What's MasterChef all about for you?

427
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,800
I think it's a continuation for me, a continuation of creativity.

428
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,720
If I make it to the end, which I will,

429
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,440
I think the options, they're endless.

430
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,120
The big thing I want from Maria is I want punch,

431
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,560
because her food just needs to sing a bit louder.

432
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,400
Being in this, it's like having a superpower,

433
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,280
it's your brain switching on your nerve endings

434
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,880
so you're ready for the fight.

435
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,720
So I try to embrace it. If I'm not nervous -

436
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,840
hey, that's scary because it means I don't care.

437
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,800
Why so many onions, Jamie?

438
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,720
Well, onions are in both my dishes.

439
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,160
I'm a fan of onions, what can I say?

440
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,160
So, my two courses are a shallot tarte Tatin

441
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,560
and then my second course is roast duck with pea,

442
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,640
mushroom and onion puree and a Madeira sauce.

443
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,600
If you're making a tarte Tatin, that means those onions have got to

444
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,520
go in the oven with some pastry and if you don't get them in soon, mate,

445
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,720
- you're going to run out of time. 
- Yeah, exactly.

446
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,120
So, I would hurry if I was you, young Jamie.

447
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,000
In the lead up to the competition, I've been trying lots

448
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,800
of new recipes, different techniques.

449
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,480
Some things have gone really well,

450
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,760
some things haven't worked out so well.

451
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,680
Leanne's cooking cod and chorizo.

452
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,720
Yeah, that works, I get that.

453
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,040
And then potatoes cooked in oil

454
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
flavoured with saffron

455
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,080
and a butter lemon sauce.

456
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,480
If she can amalgamate those four big flavours, I'll be very impressed.

457
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,000
Dessert, frangipane with ginger and apricots is going to be fantastic.

458
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,480
Sticky, sweet ginger,

459
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,880
a little bit of warmth in the back of your throat.

460
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,600
Fluffy up bits of frangipane beside a crispy pastry base.

461
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Mmm.

462
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,800
Why these two courses, Leanne?

463
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,120
I love chorizo.

464
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,000
I think it's a beautiful flavour and I especially love it with

465
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,280
the fresh sweetness of cod.

466
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,720
I think it's a marriage made in heaven.

467
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,080
And I absolutely love ginger -

468
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,680
it's one of my favourite ingredients, as well.

469
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,400
I feel like I need to stick to my creative side

470
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,600
but hopefully I can excite them more than I can scare them.

471
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,360
For my main course, I'm cooking steak with cubed potatoes,

472
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,440
a mushroom foam and celeriac puree with a red wine reduction.

473
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,800
And for my dessert,

474
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,920
I'm cooking custard ravioli with an apple coulis and pecan crumb.

475
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,080
- Custard ravioli? 
- Yes, indeed.

476
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,720
- Ravioli full of custard? 
- Yep. 
- With apple puree?

477
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,040
- Yes. 
- Do you make the ravioli in exactly the same way

478
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,360
you would savoury pasta?

479
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,720
Yes, but I cook it in a very light sugar syrup.

480
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,680
What does that do to the flour and eggs mix?

481
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,720
I'm not entirely sure!

482
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,280
I tell you what I'm not doing with his ravioli -

483
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,200
- I'm not grating Parmesan across the top. 
- Let's just hope he doesn't.

484
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,240
You've had 40 minutes.

485
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,480
40 minutes gone.

486
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,560
Since leaving MasterChef, me and Billy have joined up,

487
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,120
done a couple of supper clubs which have gone down really well.

488
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,520
We've been cooking for the public, which is fantastic.

489
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,840
I think we did for 37 last time,

490
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
so no small feat to cook for that many,

491
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,240
which we found out - plating for 37 is a pretty tall order.

492
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,360
So we don't cut ourselves much slack.

493
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,080
I've gone from a stay-at-home mum to doing foodie festivals,

494
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,800
writing a lot of recipes.

495
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,240
I've been teaching and some charity work, as well.

496
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,520
I mean, you couldn't ask for more, really.

497
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,800
I just remember how nervous you were when you have to stand there and tell people what you're cooking.

498
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,840
- Well, we're nice, aren't we? 
- Yeah, hopefully. 
- Well... 
- Well.

499
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,920
We'll see what they serve up!

500
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,200
You've got five minutes, my friend.

501
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
- Five minutes. 
- OK.

502
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,120
Fish cooked?

503
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,200
- Almost. 
- How almost?

504
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,400
One minute almost or five minutes almost?

505
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,920
About one minute.

506
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,640
A herb-crusted baked cod with pea puree, mashed potato and dill.

507
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,280
- It all sounds really lovely. 
- Yeah.

508
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,400
Obviously, the cooking of the cod is absolutely key.

509
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,200
Mashed potato, I hope there's a lot of butter.

510
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,320
I love a buttery mash.

511
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,840
Come on, mate. Make your decision, quick.

512
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,240
- The fish looks great. 
- Thank you.

513
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,160
As long as it doesn't break up, you'll be fine.

514
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,760
Two minutes left, Richard.

515
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,640
Very nice.

516
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,000
Here we go.

517
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,840
What else has got to go on the plate, Richard?

518
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,880
Just a sprinkle of the dill.

519
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,200
Right, let's go, then.

520
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,880
- OK, done. 
- Go!

521
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,800
- Looks very good. 
- Yeah.

522
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,520
OK, guys, I made you a herb-encrusted cod loin,

523
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,400
baked with a pea puree -

524
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,120
one smooth, one a bit coarse -

525
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,040
and some hopefully creamy mashed potato.

526
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,120
- Thanks very much. 
- Thank you very much, Richard.

527
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,520
I think the main event, the cod, he's done OK.

528
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,560
I mean, mine's flaking quite nicely.

529
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,000
The herb crust on the top is crunchy, it's seasoned well.

530
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,120
I don't know why you have two pea purees because, to me,

531
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,920
they taste pretty similar and they're both not entirely pleasant.

532
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,080
I agree with the pea purees, they don't really pack the punch.

533
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,440
And the mash is a little lumpy and grainy and needs some more butter.

534
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,600
To me, the whole dish is crying out for a sauce.

535
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,480
The fish is cooked OK.

536
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,920
However, there's not a great deal of flavour of this plate.

537
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,680
It's all very bland.

538
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,200
That's his main course and I'm concerned about his dessert

539
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,520
because that tart's just come out of the oven.

540
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,840
You have about seven minutes, Richard.

541
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,320
Here we go. Whoa!

542
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,120
I mean, a well-done lemon tart is a fine thing.

543
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,360
Is that set enough to cut?

544
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,440
- I think so. 
- You think so? 
- Yeah.

545
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,160
The moment of truth.

546
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,760
- Is it OK? 
- No, it could have done with a bit longer.

547
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,440
Here we go.

548
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,520
Now cream.

549
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,920
- Can we go? 
- We can go. 
- Go!

550
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:48,040
OK, guys, you have a baked lemon tart with a Mascarpone cream

551
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,400
with some popping candy and a raspberry coulis.

552
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,960
I have to say, I'm a bit nervous about this.

553
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,040
- I've got scrambled egg, guys. 
- I know you have.

554
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,360
The tart filling is obviously scrambled and he's had a bit of a nightmare, hasn't he?

555
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,520
It's unfortunate.

556
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,840
I really feel for Richard with this, it just has not worked at all.

557
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,560
The tart is the texture of porridge and it's far too sharp,

558
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,880
far too sharp. No, that's a disaster.

559
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,200
The lemon baked tart really let me down, really disappointed with that.

560
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,320
Hopefully they'll appreciate what I've tried to do in the time.

561
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,760
- Maria, are you going to be on time? 
- I think so.

562
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,920
- You think so? 
- Yes, I am.

563
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,080
Warm Asian mushroom salad.

564
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,240
Yeah, it's not giving anything away.

565
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
I presume there's mushrooms in it!

566
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,600
I mean, it's all about the spicing on this and making sure it really

567
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,480
tastes intensely of mushrooms.

568
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,400
- Happy, Maria? 
- I'm happy.

569
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,400
I'm done in time and I think it'll taste the way I want it to taste.

570
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,000
Let's go, come on.

571
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,120
Hello. I've made you a warm Asian mushroom salad.

572
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,800
Enjoy.

573
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,520
I'm pleasantly surprised with the taste.

574
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,680
You're getting the sesame, you're getting the garlic

575
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,600
- and the soy coming through. 
- I do like the flavours very much.

576
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,960
It's a very lovely thing to eat but by the same token,

577
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,840
I think it's just missing a trick somewhere.

578
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,000
There's no textural element, there's no freshness to the plate.

579
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,840
I think she could have been braver.

580
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,160
That is chop it up, put it in a wok and shake it.

581
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,760
It's a tasty put it in a wok and shake it.

582
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,200
There's not a lot to it but she's got the balance just right.

583
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,160
I need a fork.

584
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,160
Hake is not the easiest fish to cook, but if you nail it,

585
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,560
I find it delicious.

586
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,800
Right, OK.

587
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,360
If she does it well, then it could be the standout dish of the day.

588
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,440
And then is it just rice in a ring?

589
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,880
Rice in a ring.

590
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,240
Thank you, Maria.

591
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,640
I've made you baked hake on a bed of vegetables

592
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,800
and with a miso sauce

593
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,600
and a sticky sushi rice.

594
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,520
I feel pretty good, let's hope they feel pretty good.

595
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,760
I think the hake is cooked brilliantly,

596
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,560
I think that's cooked really well but there is just an overriding

597
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,440
sweetness throughout. I don't get any of the miso.

598
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,200
Miso's salty, it's supposed to hit you with that salt

599
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,840
and I don't get it.

600
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,760
I actually quite like this dish.

601
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,560
Oh, Jack.

602
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,000
It is slightly sweet but if I had that on a Friday night with a...

603
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,600
So what you're saying is she should start a takeaway?

604
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,000
Do you know what? If she started a takeaway,

605
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,520
I'd be there every day because I think the two dishes she's done

606
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,840
for us have been solid, if not spectacular.

607
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,520
In there the blend of Japanese goodies of miso and soy sauce

608
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,160
is a rogue ingredient. It's called honey.

609
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,800
And it's made it too sweet.

610
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,400
However, the second time Maria has cooked a lovely piece of fish.

611
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,400
Wow. Tarte Tatin.

612
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,640
If it is caramelised and if the pastry's crisp,

613
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,200
it will be an amazing thing.

614
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,280
Yeah, I reckon we could be in for a treat.

615
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,880
- How's that tarte Tatin? 
- They're looking good, actually,

616
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,520
and I'm quite happy with those.

617
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,400
Nice.

618
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,720
I might be nuts for doing this, but we'll see.

619
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,880
That's it, I think.

620
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,080
Go on, son. Well done, Jamie.

621
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,720
That pastry looks like it's not cooked, to me.

622
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,640
Thanks very much.

623
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,280
Thank you, Jamie.

624
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,240
So, what I've got for you today is a shallot tarte Tatin with a whipped

625
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,640
goat's cheese and some macadamia nuts and some crispy onions

626
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,360
and some balsamic.

627
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,200
- I hope you enjoy. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. 
- Cheers.

628
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,680
For a dish that visually promised so much,

629
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,240
actually, what I've got is a pile of raw shallots and raw pastry.

630
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,480
Which is a shame because it had the hallmarks of a really good dish.

631
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,240
I like the macadamia with the goat's cheese.

632
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,200
I like the sweet, crispy onions across the top.

633
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,480
I even like the reduction of balsamic vinegar.

634
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,920
I think this dish has great promise.

635
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,480
What it's lacking is time.

636
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,800
Roast duck, Madeira, mushroom, onion and peas.

637
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,040
I'm looking for that to be, you know, cooked properly.

638
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,400
I want that pink in the middle and I want everything else to

639
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
really kind of make that duck sing.

640
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,720
The sweetness of Madeira going lovely with the duck,

641
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,360
the other three elements, you don't know what guise they'll come in

642
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,840
so I'm quite intrigued about how that's going to be presented.

643
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,880
- Happy with the duck? 
- I am happy with the duck, yeah.

644
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,480
What needs to go on there now?

645
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,960
Just some duck leg which I've roasted off.

646
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,480
Sauce in jugs and we're in business, right?

647
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,800
Yeah.

648
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,280
- Good job. 
- Let's go.

649
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,640
Thank you, Jamie.

650
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,440
So, what we have here is some roast duck with some onion puree and some

651
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,080
mushroom, peas and some Madeira sauce.

652
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,880
I think it's a definite improvement from the first course.

653
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,880
Absolutely, it is. I think the duck is cooked well, it's succulent,

654
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,240
it's juicy. The Madeira sauce is sweet enough, it goes with the duck.

655
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,040
It eats well and I think if he carries on cooking like this,

656
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,440
he could go a long way in this competition.

657
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,760
Very sophisticated flavourings.

658
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,920
Jamie has finally been successful in producing a coherent,

659
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,360
very tasty dish.

660
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,160
My tarte Tatin was a little bit underdone, unfortunately.

661
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,600
I just didn't have enough time to keep it in the oven.

662
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,240
But, hey, I gave it a good crack.

663
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,280
I thought the dishes were OK.

664
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,840
You've got five minutes, all right?

665
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,720
Until this fish goes out.

666
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,680
- Yes, that's great. 
- Are you going to be OK? 
- Yeah.

667
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,920
Great flavours.

668
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,560
I love cod, I love chorizo, I love samphire and a lemon butter sauce.

669
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,520
If it's done well, then I'll be a happy boy.

670
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,320
Confit potatoes, please, nice, soft and melting.

671
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,560
Yeah, lovely. Lovely.

672
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,920
- Hey! 
- Saffron chips.

673
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,160
- Cod good? 
- Yeah.

674
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,000
Is the cod going on top of the samphire?

675
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,600
- Yeah. 
- So we can't do anything until...?

676
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,720
- Can we put the lemon sauce on? 
- No.

677
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,520
It's coming now. It will literally be 30 seconds.

678
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,480
Nice. Very, very nice.

679
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,520
We've put fish on, we've put sauce on, we go?

680
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,880
Yep.

681
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,640
I love the colours.

682
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,080
Go with the cod.

683
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,400
Well done, Leanne. Well done, well done.

684
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,440
So, I've made pan-fried cod with chorizo, samphire

685
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,200
and saffron potatoes,

686
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,800
with a lemon butter drizzle on the side.

687
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,320
I think the cod's cooked beautifully,

688
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,200
the potatoes could maybe do with being a bit crispier

689
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,560
but they taste good.

690
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,240
The lemon butter sauce is overly acidic but if you take little dabs

691
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,720
of it with everything else, it's actually quite refreshing

692
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,680
and cuts through the richness of the chorizo.

693
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,240
So I think it does work.

694
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,040
What you want is really solid, tasty food

695
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,640
and Leanne has delivered that in bucketfuls.

696
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,280
Leanne has cooked a perfect piece of cod - flaky, soft.

697
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,960
Those potatoes cooked in saffron with the chorizo,

698
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,760
paprika floating all over it.

699
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,040
- I'm bowled over by that flavour sensation. 
- It works.

700
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,000
I love a frangipane tart if it's done well

701
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,880
but there are pitfalls there.

702
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,520
We know there's not much time today.

703
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,760
They're still really damp in the middle and I don't know if it's

704
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,520
from the apricots, or that the frangipane hasn't cooked,

705
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,800
so I'm going to give them as long as I can.

706
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,240
I want the ginger to come through,

707
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,240
I want there to be that heat from the ginger.

708
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,880
That might work really well.

709
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,720
Hey...

710
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,840
Two minutes and we're going, Leanne.

711
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,760
I like those.

712
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,560
Oh, we are grown-up.

713
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,960
Here we go. Here's our ginger.

714
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,640
Look at all the vanilla in it. Look at that, lovely vanilla and ginger.

715
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,720
Go on, Leanne.

716
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,560
Go get 'em, kid.

717
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,400
- Go get 'em. 
- Happy? 
- Yeah. 
- Good job.

718
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,120
It looks good. I hope it tastes good.

719
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,600
Thank you.

720
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,560
- Here we are, Jane. 
- Thank you, Leanne.

721
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,080
So, today I've made apricot, ginger frangipane tart

722
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,800
with just a creme fraiche and a ginger and vanilla syrup.

723
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,480
- I hope you enjoy. 
- Fantastic. 
- Thank you.

724
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,960
Thank you.

725
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,400
This smells divine.

726
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,360
- It really does. 
- I want to just plant my face right in there.

727
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,800
We can make that happen if you want!

728
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,480
This pastry is beautiful,

729
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,800
it's so crumbly and buttery and light and it's just perfect for this

730
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,640
dessert. Hats off to her at this stage of the competition.

731
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,440
I just think it's lovely.

732
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,480
Lovely bit of sweetness and vanilla from the syrup.

733
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,920
You've got some little crystallised ginger inside as well which I wasn't

734
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,240
expecting. I love crystallised ginger and then

735
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,080
the soft apricot on the top.

736
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,920
I really like it. I think it's a good dish.

737
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,560
A round of applause for Leanne, she's done exceptionally well.

738
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,400
She should be very proud of herself.

739
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,640
I agree.

740
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,400
For me, so far, dish of the day.

741
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,720
I'd eat the whole lot.

742
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,800
She's a good cook, John. She looks solid as a rock.

743
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,000
Do you know what? I really tried my best.

744
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,760
I put everything into those dishes so I hope they're good enough.

745
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,160
Steak and Friends.

746
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,760
Well, let's hope that these are good friends.

747
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,480
- Lewis, you've got four minutes. 
- OK.

748
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,760
- Plenty of time. 
- Are you OK?

749
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,960
- Yeah. 
- Keep your nerve.

750
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,440
Where's your mushroom foam?

751
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,200
It's coming last minute.

752
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,880
- Where's your red wine sauce? 
- That's coming last minute.

753
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,640
This is the last minute, Lewis.

754
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,720
I like the idea he's doing a foam and I love that but so many times you get disappointed with them -

755
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,640
they're weak and they're watery.

756
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,400
I think it will be a mushroom sauce instead.

757
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,120
Right. Right, let's go.

758
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,200
- Oh, sorry. 
- Thank you, Lewis.

759
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,640
Today, I'm serving for you a sous vide steak,

760
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,120
potato cubes with celeriac puree,

761
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,680
a red wine reduction and what should have been a mushroom foam

762
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,920
but, unfortunately, it's a mushroom sauce.

763
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,480
- Thank you very much, hope you enjoy it. 
- Thank you, Lewis.

764
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,320
That mushroom, I'm really glad it's not foam because it packs a punch in

765
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,640
flavour. The steak's cooked, the potatoes are lovely and fluffy,

766
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,280
crispy on the outside.

767
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,360
It just feels like it needs a little bit more love to bring it together.

768
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,520
The elements were all there. I think he's just over-thought it.

769
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,240
- He's second-guessed himself. 
- Yeah.

770
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,800
Everything's done really well.

771
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,960
The sauces are made well, the puree's fine,

772
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,920
the steak's cooked really, really well,

773
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,400
it's the presentation that's all bonkers.

774
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,640
Custard ravioli.

775
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,600
Wow. I don't think even I'm mad enough to try that at this stage.

776
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,040
It's incredibly out there and I applaud his bravery.

777
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,120
I just hope that it shows in the dish.

778
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,400
Are you pleased that you've done this?

779
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,920
I had to try.

780
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,400
Gently, gently, gently.

781
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,760
- Is that it now? 
- Yeah.

782
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,400
Go on, Lewis. Off you go with your ravioli.

783
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,160
Good luck.

784
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,880
So, we have custard filling inside ravioli

785
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,160
with an apple coulis and some nuts - scattered nuts. Thank you.

786
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,480
I was worried about this on the menu when it was written.

787
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,840
I think I'm even more worried for it now!

788
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,600
Unfortunately, I've got no custard in my ravioli

789
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,560
and the actual pasta itself is not very good.

790
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,360
It's really hard and thick and quite unpalatable.

791
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,160
I mean, it has a decent apple sauce if you've got a lovely bit of

792
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,720
Sunday pork, a bit of crackling, delightful.

793
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,800
Not quite sure what it's doing there with some pasta and nuts.

794
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,000
This hasn't worked. But dishes don't work all the time.

795
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,480
This is at the experimental stage.

796
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,520
He hasn't quite yet refined it.

797
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,840
I think that's true of all of his cooking.

798
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,160
Pretty devastated, yeah.

799
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,760
I think I didn't do as good as I could have.

800
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,400
I guess I got a bit complacent towards the end of my main

801
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,520
and I found myself struggling to get the main out

802
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,000
and then struggling to get the dessert out.

803
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,160
Decision time.

804
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,320
Two have to leave us.

805
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,280
I've got a star, someone that you and I liked

806
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,560
and somebody who also impressed our guest judges.

807
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,320
And that was Leanne.

808
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,960
She's a solid, solid contestant.

809
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,760
She goes straight through.

810
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,400
Richard impressed in the first round with his ravioli.

811
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,880
Unfortunately, his two courses let him down in this round.

812
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,520
I think Richard has actually run his race.

813
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,840
- I'll tell you who I'd like to see stay. 
- Who?

814
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,240
Jamie. If he carried on making mistake upon mistake,

815
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,120
I'd be doubtful, but the quality of his duck, I thought, was solid.

816
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:32,080
But that then puts Lewis and Maria against each other.

817
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,160
From my own game, I just really hope that they can see I did try a lot.

818
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,880
Right now I'm, at best, borderline to be going.

819
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,160
If I could make it to the next round,

820
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,840
I'll prove to them that I can keep on going

821
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,160
with all the challenges that I'm given and dealing with the pressure.

822
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,400
Our first quarterfinalist...

823
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,480
..is Leanne. Congratulations.

824
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,680
Very well done.

825
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,320
Our second quarterfinalist...

826
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,560
..is Jamie.

827
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,400
Wow.

828
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,480
Flipping hell.

829
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,000
- Well done. 
- Thank you.

830
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,920
Our third and final quarterfinalist...

831
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,520
..is Maria. Congratulations.

832
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,720
Richard, Lewis, very good to have met you.

833
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,240
Thanks, gentlemen.

834
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,040
I have no-one to blame but myself, really.

835
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,760
I just tried to do too much.

836
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,160
It's sad but I'll live.

837
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,040
It's a completely different ball game than cooking at home.

838
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,360
It's a lot of pressure but a lot of fun.

839
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,280
Quarterfinalists, well done.

840
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:33,840
Wow! I'm very surprised and I'm delighted.

841
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,520
This experience, I'll already never forget and now I get another go

842
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,320
so I'm thrilled.

843
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,480
A little bit scared about what's to come so basically I'm going to go

844
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,280
home and read a lot of recipe books.

845
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,200
Tomorrow, eight more cooks battle it out for a place in the quarterfinal.

846
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,440
Oh, I can't believe that.

847
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,880
My first 30 seconds, white panic.

848
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,440
A bit pushed but I'll be all right.

849
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,640
You haven't started your dessert at all?

850
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,520
You've got 15 minutes, it needs to be out the door.

851
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,840
For me, that's a massive ten out of ten.
