Yeah, then we better move quick.

164
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,115
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

165
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,551
If we try to move him,
we could make it worse.

166
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:19,770
All right, then. I'll go get some help.

167
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,249
No, it's too dangerous
the way I came in.

168
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,077
- All right?
- So what do we do?

169
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:26,080
We wait until CFD comes to get us out.

170
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:28,430
It's the safest option, all right?

171
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,437
I need to get control of this bleed.

172
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:37,614
I need to create a pressure
dressing for this wound.

173
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:39,297
Give me your tie.

174
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,099
Hang in there for me, Nathaniel.

175
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:46,884
And you're gonna feel
some pressure, okay?

176
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:48,102
Okay.

177

[SCREAMS IN PAIN]

178
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:52,629
Morning, Dr. Taylor.

179
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:54,258
Hey.

180
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,590
Rose, Emmanuel, this is Dr. Halstead.

181
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,462
Hi. Sorry to hear
you're feeling poorly, Rose.

182
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:02,421
Dr. Taylor thought
I might be able to help.

183
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,772
The more, the merrier.
I'm well-accustomed to doctors.

184
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:08,427
My wife has type 1 diabetes
and hypertension.

185
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,777
But Rose is here today
because of a chronic UTI.

186
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,519
Her internist prescribed her
several rounds of antibiotics,

187
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,564
but none of them have done anything.

188
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:18,785
So I sent a urine test with cultures.

189
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:20,569
Mm-hmm.

190
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:22,833
Multi-resistant fungal infection.

191
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,749
"Fungal" is such
an unpleasant word, isn't it?

192
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,794
A lot of medical words are...

193
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:29,666
Phlegm, discharge.

194
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:31,798
Rose taught
11th grade English composition

195
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:32,930
for 32 years.

196
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:34,192
Words are her thing.

197
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,281
Some are just naturally embarrassing,

198
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,196
like having a fungus.

199
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,677
Well, no need to be
embarrassed here, Rose.

200
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,941
It says it's sensitive to voriconazole
and amphotericin only.

201
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:45,943
So voriconazole. 200 milligrams. IV.

202
00:07:45,986 --> 00:07:49,424
Um, I had the same thought,
but there's a problem.

203
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,600
- It's on the shortage list.
- For three weeks now.

204
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:53,211
What about this other medication?

205
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:56,344
Let us talk it over.
We'll be right back.

206
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,390
Amphotericin B is old-school.

207
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,348
- They call it amphoterrible.
- I know.

208
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:03,525
And Rose's kidneys are already
compromised because of her diabetes.

209
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,658
Her creatinine is 2.8 to start.

210
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,834
Ampho will knock them out
and put her in dialysis,

211
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:09,183
or worse, kill her.

212
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:10,794
It has to be voriconazole.

213
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:12,752
Let's start calling around
hospitals, pharmacies,

214
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,536
- see if they have any.
- No, I already did.

215
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,060
Everyone I talked to in Chicago was out.

216
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:17,551
I'm not sure what the next move is,

217
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,367
which is why I dragged you into this.

218
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,195
I mean, what do you do
if you can't get the only drug

219
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,588
that'll treat an infection?

220
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:27,245
The pain is localized to her back.

221
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,203
It says here her UA is dirty.

222
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,728
Yeah, that's not normal for a urine dip,

223
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:33,381
but it also doesn't scream
infection either.

224
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,470
- Mm-hmm.
- I checked the shortage list,

225
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,081
and I know that
the contrast dye supply is low.

226
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:38,560
- It's currently restricted.
- Yes.

227
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:41,433
But protocol also states
that if a patient needs a CT...

228
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:43,483
Okay, did you ultrasound her
for a kidney stone?

229
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:45,567
- No.
- Why don't you?

230
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:47,569
Kidney stones usually present
in pregnant women

231
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:50,050
- with peritonitis or flank pain.
- Right.

232
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:51,443
Candace only has low back pain.

233
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:54,402
Sure. You can still
ultrasound her to check.

234
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:56,404
I could, but as we both know,

235
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,450
ultrasound is not
very sensitive for a stone.

236
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,017
A CT would give me a much better picture

237
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,583
- of what's actually going on.
- Okay.

238
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:03,455
So if the ultrasound doesn't
show anything conclusive,

239
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:05,283
you'll order the CT, yeah?

240
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,373
- I'll do an ultrasound then.
- Right.

241
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,897
And you might want to start her
on empiric antibiotics too.

242
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:13,465
In case it's pyelonephritis,
you should get ahead of that.

243
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:18,818
I mean, like, it's perfectly natural

244
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:22,822
for a teenager to want distance from...

245
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,782
From their parents, right?
But I don't know.

246
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:28,436
Recently, it just seems like
she doesn't want anything

247
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,092
to do with me at all anymore.

248
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,094
That may only be temporary.

249
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:35,704
And it's healthy for your daughter

250
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,402
to seek out this kind of independence.

251
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:39,404
You think that I, of all
people, wouldn't know that?

252
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:42,799
But I don't know, man. It's been a...

253
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:45,976
surprisingly difficult pill
to swallow, you know?

254
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,630
And that kind of dovetails
with this other issue

255
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:50,110
that I'm having at work, right,

256
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:53,853
involving being there for
patients in difficult times.

257
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:56,856
I mean, I'm used to living
in those uncomfortable moments, right?

You've been doing this a long time.

- Mm-hmm.
- But recently,

261
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:04,342
when, say, I have to give a patient,

262
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:07,954
like, a really tough diagnosis, right,

263
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:12,437
like, tell them
or the people that they love

264
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,266
that they have
a lifelong mental illness...

Their lives are over.

266
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:18,356
Yeah.

267
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,315
And I've been haunted
by these moments, right?

268
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,621
They stick with me.

269
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,884
It's like sometimes
they stare back at me.

00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:26,364
Sometimes they cry.

271
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,148
Sometimes they don't know
what to do, nor should they.

We applied pressure dressings en route

Your kidney is not draining effectively,

00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:19,474

uncommon in pregnant women.

All the fluid and air

Now the fluid stays, but
the air is still on the move,

so we have to reroute that air
through this tube here,

into bottle number two, the water seal.
