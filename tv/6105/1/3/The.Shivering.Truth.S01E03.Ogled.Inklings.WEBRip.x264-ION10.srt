Announcer: Life flashes forced
Officer Dale

159
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,928
to recall
his first disappointment...

160
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,638
how, since the age of 6,

161
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,684
he yearned for a puppy
but his parents were allergic...

162
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,018
to making him happy.

163
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,313
So, instead, they had
his grandma move in,

164
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,023
and Dale taught her some tricks.

165
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,402
He trained Nana to sit up
and beg for her meds.

166
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:29,031
She could shake...

...catch a Frisbee
in her teeth.

168
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,246
When she messed the rug,
he rubbed her nose in it

169
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:39,208
until the foul of her
unpleasantness was gone.

170
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,628
But when Dale took Nana
to the vet to get fixed,

171
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,297
they discovered she had mange,

172
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:49,510
and he had to put her out of his
misery and into his ecstasy.

[ Gunshot ]

174
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,639
Weeks later, when his chum
got a 3-legged dog,

175
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,810
Dale was jealous because he
could only afford a pet leg.

176
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,607
It spent all day humping itself,
happy as a lark's arm,

177
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,319
and even gave birth
to a litter of toe-lets...

178
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,907
until the day it got hit
by a wheel.

179
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,326
Doctors had to amputate
his whole body

180
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,828
and replace him
with a wooden one.

Other dogs mistook Sock
for a stick,

182
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:23,002
so he contracted rabies
and went on a rampage.

183
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,631
Witnessing such carnage
gave Dale a deep desire

184
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,591
to create his own fate.

185
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,595
But tragically, the urge
to conjure a better new world

186
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,933
can turn even a decent
human being into a poet.
