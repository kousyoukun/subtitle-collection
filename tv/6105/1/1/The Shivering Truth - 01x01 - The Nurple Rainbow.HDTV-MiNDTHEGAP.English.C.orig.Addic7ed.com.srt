1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:02,319


2
00:00:02,354 --> 00:00:04,488
Our best minds have determined
我们最好的大脑决定了

3
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:09,576
that the whole universe is the dream of one ant
整个宇宙是一只蚂蚁的梦

4
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:26,711
A-Are you okay
你还好吗

5
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:30,055
I was just sleeping and I heard troubled breath
刚才我在睡觉然后听见了喊叫声

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,391
Nothing.Nothing.I-I'm fine.
没事 我还好


7
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:34,142
I just... had a nightmare.
我只是做了个噩梦

8
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:35,511
What are you accusing me of?
你在怪我？

9
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:40,440
I-I didn't shove anything
all up in your ear.

10
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:44,611
I never seen that thing
before in my life.

11
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:46,230
I don't even know what it is.

12
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:49,316
Besides, my thing would need
one twice that size.

13
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:51,201
What did you do to me?!

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,330
Stop this!
What d... What did you do?

15
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:56,532
- Huh?
- Get up!

16
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:59,493
W-W-What's happening?
W-Why are you hitting me?

17
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:02,796
What have you done to me
while I was sleeping?

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,300
What did you do to me?

19
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:11,172
I ... I didn't do anything.
I don't think I did.

20
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:13,098
Did I do something to you?

21
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,759
Oh, God!
What did I do?!

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,227
What did you do to me?
You monster!

23
00:01:17,262 --> 00:01:20,021
I'm sorry.
I'm so confused.

24
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:22,315
It's okay.
I forgive you.

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,819
- These things happen.
- Why are you so good to me?

26
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:29,614
Because you have such tight,
pretty ears.

27
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:33,034
Not really.
You really wanna know?

28
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:35,370
I've never shown anyone this.

29
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:42,043
It's huge.

30
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,046
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

31
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:54,318

<b>1x01 - The Nurple Rainbow</b>

33
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:02,198
Then again,
toddler prodigy Trudy Glimmer

34
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:08,183
was the greatest peekaboo player
the world had ever known.

35
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,198
Trudy?

36
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,041
W-Where's Trudy?
I just saw her.

37
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:13,418
She was just here.
Where'd she go?

38
00:02:13,453 --> 00:02:14,620
Where'd she go?!

39
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:16,796
Oh, God.
She was just here!

40
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:19,591
Oh, my God! Trudy!

41
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:22,510
Where'd you go?!
Oh, my God.

42
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:23,921
Oh, Trudy!
My baby!

43
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:25,464
Where's my baby?!

44
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:28,842
911! Someone stole my baby!
Oh, God!

45
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:30,511
Someone stole my baby!

46
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:33,354
Oh, God, oh, God, oh God.

47
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,848
- Oh, God.
- What's going on?

48
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:36,733
Where's Trudy?
What happened?!

49
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,610
- Where is she?!
- Aah!

50
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:44,574
You get that bastard
that took her!

51
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:47,452
If he hurt a hair
on her head, I swear,

52
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:51,039
I'm gonna rip God's face off
and ... and ram it down his tip.

53
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:54,125
I promise
I will find your daughter,

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,004
even if I have to
kill her to do it.

55
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,965
Police rounded up
every pervert in the area,

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,093
torturing them for information,

57
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:06,096
which, naturally,
the perverts loved.

58
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:09,182
They undulated
orgasmically for more.

59
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:12,268
The cops were all
too happy to oblige.

60
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:16,564
Nipple twisting,
purple nurples, blue nurples,

61
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,485
every nurple in the rainbow
turned up a steaming pile of zilch.

62
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,990
The trauma of losing their child
tore the parents apart.

63
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:30,203
Last year, I let your brothers
sandwich my business.

64
00:03:30,238 --> 00:03:33,331
Ah, yeah, so did I, Chachi.
So did I.

65
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:36,835
Before long, a father
finds a suitable outlet

66
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,920
to properly deal with his grief.

67
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:44,905
If I don't see my child again
soon, I'm gonna do this.

68
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:51,683
Some children
are just naturally talented.

69
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:55,762
- We'll never know why.
- Peekaboo!

70
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:58,606
Trudy!
Oh, sweetie, where were you?

71
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:01,901
Oh, my God, Trudy.
Don't ever disappear again.

72
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:05,738
Trudy?!
Trudy! Trudy!!

73
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:14,828
Peekaboo.
Mama? Papa?

74
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:21,459
We have long known
that chickens can live for years

75
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,953
with their heads cut off.

76
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:25,255
Recently, embedded Mideast
war reporters

77
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,925
have been dosing with huge
infusions of chicken blood

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,636
to frustrate
their terrorist beheaders.

79
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,932
- This is what western infidels get!
- Is that all you got, cha-cha?

80
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,521
Shut up and die,
you infidel pig dog.

81
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:45,934
Uh, correction ... chicken dog.
Bawk-bawk.

82
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,069
You are making me angry.

83
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:51,531
And you have schmutz
on your dress.

84
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:54,868
Bonk! Gotcha!
Bawk-bawk, playa!

85
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:57,829
Innocent
bystanders were so amused,

86
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,740
they took the act on the road.

87
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:02,542
Why will you not die already?

88
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:05,837
Uh, why don't you
brush your teeth already?

89
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,206
I'm warning you ...

90
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,842
keep it up and I'll stop
this holy war right now.

91
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,803
Bawk-bawk, homey.
A-bawk-bawk.

92
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,143
Mmm, check the hottie
in the front row.

93
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:22,812
Hey, uh, missy,
you care for a three-way?

94
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:24,689
Or at least a 2 1/4-way?

95
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,903
Hey, I'm not severed where it counts.

96
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:32,155
Please die, for the love of Allah.

97
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,867
Tell you what, I'll die
if you answer one question.

98
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:40,997
- You have a deal. Fire away.
- Why does your faith glorify hate?

99
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:46,211
You really want to know?

100
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:50,256
For me, it's ...
s-see, I never had a mother.

101
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,011
Wait, wait,
if you never had a mom,

102
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,888
then how do you exist at all?

103
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,849
Jumpin' Jihad, you're right.

104
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,231
At that precise moment,

105
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:11,148
only one man was having
a worse day at work.

106
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:15,137
We are so freaking
disappointed in your output, Dwyer.

107
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:16,838
Everyone else
in this department types

108
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:19,065
at least 10,000
random numbers a day.

109
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,395
- Your average is 19.
- Sorry, sir. It's just ...

110
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:26,114
- I ... It's just ...
- What's so hard about it?

111
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:28,867
Just type random numbers
as fast as you can.

112
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:32,454
See? Ding, ding, ding, ding.
That's it. Easy peasy.

113
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:36,207
- Now you try. Go!
- Uh. Um...

114
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:38,752
Let's see, uh...
Ooh...

115
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:43,048
- Uh... Um...
- Just hit numbers!

116
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,799
Faster. Faster!

117
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,927
But I can never decide
which number to choose.

118
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:48,970
Don't think about it.
Just type. It's random.

119
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:53,642
- I know, but I still want it to be good.
- Well, it isn't good.

120
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:54,885
And what's this?

121
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:56,895
There's some type
of Goddamn hole

122
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,848
in the back of your head here...
Whoa.

123
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,067
Weird little critter living in there.

124
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:05,278
Hey, little guy.
What the hell, Dwyer?

125
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:07,781
- I wish you could see this.
- What is it?

126
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:10,818
What is it?! What, Dwyer, how
the hell am I supposed to know?

127
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,361
Get your act together.

128
00:07:12,362 --> 00:07:15,080
Let me feed
this little thing for you.

129
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:19,834
Damn thing was hungry.

130
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,003
Maybe that's why
you're doing a sucky job.

131
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:24,668
Did it eat?!
What is it?

132
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:27,543
Dagit!

133
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:30,053
The damn thing's allergic
to peanuts or something.

134
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,430
You're on thin ice
with this nonsense, Dwyer.

135
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:35,100
I'm sorry. Here, l-let me
help you wipe that up.

136
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:39,354
Just get back to work.
And get that thing checked out.

137
00:07:49,322 --> 00:07:51,491
What are you doing?

138
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:54,411
Just keep working, Dwyer.
I'm having a look.

139
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:58,748
W-What the he...
What the hell is this thing?

140
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,072
- Ah! What the heck-fire?
- Just keep working.

141
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,490
Oh. Feisty little bastard.

142
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,011
Oh, wait.
That's what's going on.

143
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:13,638
Feisty little bitch, I should say ...

144
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:17,767
- protecting her eggs.
- Eggs?

145
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:20,012
- I'm a little scared.
- It's okay.

146
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:22,188
She got the little things
hatching right now.

147
00:08:22,223 --> 00:08:24,107
- What does it look like?
- Christ, Dwyer!

148
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:27,902
Those things are loud.
Buddy, these are disruptive.

149
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:30,780
This is not appropriate

150
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:32,274
for a workspace environment.

151
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:35,118
I'm sorry. I could strap
a pillow to my head.

152
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:37,328
- Muffle it.
- I can't hear you, Dwyer!

153
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:40,199
- It's too loud!
- Or could you fill it with water

154
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,617
and drown them? Or piss?

155
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:46,087
Sorry, Dwyer!
Look, we gotta let you go.

156
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:49,966
You can fire me,
but one day I'll show you.

157
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:52,010
I'll show you all.

158
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,679
Christ, Dwyer!
It's too loud.

159
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:02,103
When he realized
that no one believed in him,

160
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:05,774
Doug rushed home to see
if he was there.

161
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:11,154
And the noble prize
for the Most Random Series

162
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:15,033
of Numbers of All Time goes to...

163
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:17,952
Dougie Dwyer!

164
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,166
When he reflected
on his strengths,

165
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:25,585
Doug finally began
to love himself.

166
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,421
And when a man
finds self-esteem,

167
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:31,841
he can coax himself
to go all the way.

168
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:41,810
It got so steamy, even
his vanity became aroused.

169
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:46,940
And Doug got to experience
every man's fantasy ...

170
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:49,275
a two-way with himself.

171
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,778
You're killing me.
Killing me.

172
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:56,032
Kill me. Kill me harder.
Kill me harder. Kill me deeper.

173
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:59,520
Kill me harder. Kill me harder,
kill me deeper, kill me harder.

174
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:05,041
But alas, someone
always gets hurt in love.

175
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:07,544
And when one raw-dogs it
with a mirror,

176
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:12,423
the fruit of your vain
comes home to roost...

177
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,468
Push! Push!

178
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,225
...and our lives are
filled with meaning forever,

179
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,978
as long as the screams
don't get so loud

180
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:28,106
that they wake the ants
that are dreaming us.
