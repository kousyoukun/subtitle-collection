1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,040
This programme contains
some strong language

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,360
and some scenes which some
viewers may find upsetting

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,760
This programme deals with Suicide

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,040
Sorry to have kept you.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,640
A bold admission
from a prison warden.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
CHAIR SCRAPES
Busy?

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,680
Oh, they let me bring my work.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,400
I hope that's OK.
Oh, it's fine, yeah.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,760
I have news for you.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,880
News?

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,320
We have a date.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,440
For what?

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,000
You.

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,280
Oh!

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,600
# You may run home
for a long time

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,360
# Run home for a long time

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,160
# You may run home for a long time

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,880
# I tell you, God Almighty's
gonna cut you down

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,080
# Great God Almighty's
gonna cut you down

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,920
# Go tell that long-tongued liar

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,640
# Go tell that midnight rider

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,760
# Tell the gambler, the rambler
the back-biter

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,560
# Tell them God Almighty's
gonna cut 'em down

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,280
# Great God Almighty's
gonna cut 'em down

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,440
# Great God Almighty's
gonna cut 'em down. #

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,720
You all right?

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,240
You need a moment?

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,680
So...the 17th?

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,040
Three weeks from today. Yes.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,960
You OK?

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,320
Are you asking if I'm available?

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,280
I now have to brief you
on the exact procedure on the day.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,840
Why?

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,760
Don't I have the easy part?

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,160
At the very least,
I get to finish early.

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,120
Go ahead.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,880
On the day before your execution,

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,080
you will be moved
from your current cell

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,280
to a holding cell next to...
A holding cell?

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,600
Yes.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,520
As opposed to what kind of cell?

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,760
Prior to leaving your current cell,

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,560
you'll have the opportunity
to clear your belongings.

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,480
They don't call it a holding cell,
do they?

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,960
Nobody does.

46
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,760
They call it the Death House.

47
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,480
# I know

48
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,200
# The sun's about to come up

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,760
# I close my eyes anyway

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,960
# My mouth is dry
and the sheets are cold

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,360
# And we'll be still
come break of day

52
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,480
# You call me up
just to surprise me

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,360
# To hear my voice
See what I'd say

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,200
# I only whispered
then hung up

55
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,600
# A whisper
Wait till break of day

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,160
# At the break of day... #

57
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,600
This has to go to the police.
There are children being abused.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm literally
the only person in the world

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,680
who can help you get away
with my murder.

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,000
# But I will share it
with whatever bird will wear it

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
# On her body bare and pink

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,560
# Now, what do you think

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,360
# On break-up day? #

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,000
Did you sleep?

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
No.  No, of course you didn't.

66
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,680
You were working at your computer.
I heard you.

67
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,960
Yeah.  You were printing
something out.

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,120
Lots of things.  Yeah.

69
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,600
Not just making random
observations,

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm asking, what were you doing?

71
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,640
It has to be convincing.

72
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,320
What does?  I do.

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,600
There's all this stuff
on my hard drive.

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Edgar's porn.
I downloaded a bit more.

75
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
More?!  He had some links.
Found some more material online.

76
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
Oh, Jesus.

77
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,520
I printed out a few.

78
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,520
A few... Yeah.

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
Images.

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,520
Put them in my safe. Like they
were hidden, like I'd been hiding.

81
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,600
Why?  To be convincing.

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,440
I have to be absolutely
convincing. No point otherwise.

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,880
Can you think of anything else
I should be doing?

84
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,240
You're destroying yourself.

85
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm saving Ben.

86
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,720
Me, as well.

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,960
You're destroying both of us.

88
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,240
Here's how I think it will go.
Did you hear me?

89
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,760
Both of us.

90
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,960
We release Janice in about an hour.

91
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,640
Let's give it an hour, yeah?  Why?
What difference does an hour make?

92
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,720
Breakfast?

93
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
It'll be my last one.

94
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,840
Our last one.

95
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,360
Our last normal breakfast
here together.

96
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,840
SNIFFS

97
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,240
Once Janice is free,
she'll go straight to the police.

98
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,160
I think that's inevitable.
Of course she bloody will.

99
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,600
The police will come here and Ben...

100
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,080
..will have an uncomfortable
interview.

101
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,200
Do you think?!
When they investigate further,

102
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,080
they'll find nothing
on his computer.

103
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,720
They'll find plenty on mine.

104
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,160
They will have no trouble believing
that a vicar

105
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,040
who has just assaulted a woman
and locked her in a cellar

106
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,120
is also a paedophile.

107
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,080
It's everything people
want to believe about vicars.

108
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,000
And how can you just be OK
with this?

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,840
Why don't we just give Edgar
to the police?

110
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,240
I tried. I can't.

111
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,200
He's a vulnerable person.
I have a duty to protect him.

112
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,000
It's the only right thing to do,
so I'm doing it.

113
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,480
I'm doing the right thing.
I have to do the right thing.

114
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,880
I'm a fucking vicar.

115
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,800
And a husband, and a father.

116
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,840
But, oh, now it's all about
that halfwit fairy tale

117
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,440
you pretend to believe every Sunday.

118
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,480
You think I'm pretending?

119
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,080
The thing about
that halfwit fairy...

120
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,600
No, don't. I don't care.

121
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,360
It's the only religion in the world
where God dies at the end.

122
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,520
PHONE RINGS

123
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,400
People say they're Christians.

124
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,880
But you know what?

125
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,200
You never see them
nailed to anything.

126
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,880
Darling, he doesn't die.
He comes back.

127
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,440
That's the hope.

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,360
That's the fairy tale.

129
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,560
And Jesus didn't have kids.

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,040
PHONE CONTINUES RINGING

131
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,200
Hello.

132
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,920
Me? It mentioned me?

133
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,560
What does it say?

134
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,960
Well, no, no, I didn't.
No, of course not.

135
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
I...I understand.
Of course, yes.

136
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,400
Sure.

137
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,880
Two o'clock's fine, yeah.

138
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,280
OK.

139
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,240
OK. Bye.

140
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,680
Who was that?

141
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,680
Edgar's dead.

142
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,520
Hanged himself last night.

143
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,920
But... But you were...  That was the
police. They want to talk to me.

144
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,520
But you were with him last night.

145
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,080
He left a note.

146
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,960
And it mentions me.

147
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,960
What?  I'm mentioned in the note.

148
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,000
What does it say?

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I need to speak to Janice.
You need to speak to me.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,800
I am speaking to you,
and I need to speak to Janice.

151
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,240
Harry!

152
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,320
Is it your fault?
Is what my fault?

153
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,200
That he hanged himself.

154
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,680
I...

155
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,360
I want to die!
Why do they have to stop me?

156
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,040
I want to die.

157
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,280
I don't have time
to think about that.

158
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,640
All right?

159
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,040
Did you manage to sleep?

160
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,480
Something's happened.

161
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,920
It's funny how good you get
at reading faces

162
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,640
when your life depends on it.

163
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,720
Last night, my verger -

164
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,840
the man I told you about, Edgar,

165
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,560
the one who, in fact,
owned the material you saw,

166
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
took his own life.

167
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,920
And he left a note.

168
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,720
What did it say?

169
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,760
If the note is...

170
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
..basically confessional in nature

171
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
it might clarify...
What did the note say?

172
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,800
I don't know.
The police are coming to talk to me.

173
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,200
Two o'clock.

174
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,040
This could be over at that point.

175
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,680
COULD be.

176
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,160
I don't care what you tell anyone
about me.

177
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,280
Er...

178
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,560
Tell them everything.
That I assaulted you,

179
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,840
I locked you up. All of it.
All I care about is that Ben

180
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,160
isn't blamed for something
that is nothing to do with him.

181
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,800
Everything here is my fault.

182
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,480
What about the agreement?

183
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,440
What agreement?

184
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,960
What we talked about.

185
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,280
Our agreement, between you and me.

186
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Er, we...we never had any.

187
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,880
It's been a long night.

188
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
I'm confused, OK?

189
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm scared.

190
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,480
I don't even really know
what I'm saying.

191
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,400
The police are coming,
two o'clock today.

192
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,280
If the note is what I think
it has to be,

193
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,360
then this whole nightmare
could be over.

194
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,560
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry
for all of it.  OK.

195
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,840
OK. What we have to do now,
we have to be calm.

196
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,640
What did she mean, agreement?

197
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,520
I don't know.
She's confused, I think.

198
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,120
You making more coffee?

199
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,200
Yeah. No. Tea.

200
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,360
I'll make it.  It's fine.

201
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I'll do it. I'll bring it out
to you in the garden.

202
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,200
I think there's a chance
this will be OK.

203
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,280
We might have been given a way out.

204
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,760
If the note is a confession...

205
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,160
..then I really think this is over.

206
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,680
Go and sit in the garden.

207
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,640
Dad?  Oh.

208
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,080
Are you OK?

209
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,720
Fine.  Sorry.

210
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,640
Just forgot that I live here?

211
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,920
You're up early.

212
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,000
Going to Lucy's before school.
Why?

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,400
Because she's my girlfriend,
and I like to seem caring.

214
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,600
She's into that.

215
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,240
Um, did Janice come back?

216
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,760
Why would Janice come back?
Well, she left her handbag.

217
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,040
I could take it to her.

218
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,120
Things got weird yesterday.
I'd like a chance to be non weird.

219
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,240
No, she came back for her handbag.
She picked it up.

220
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,120
You said she didn't come back.
Yeah. I forgot.

221
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,880
She was just in and out.
Your mum spoke to her.

222
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,760
OK.

223
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
You eating here tonight?

224
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,080
Probably.  I think your mum
would like something

225
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,360
a bit more emphatic.

226
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,440
I said probably.

227
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
DOOR CLOSES

228
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,440
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

229
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,840
TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT

230
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,880
TANNOY DROWNS SPEECH

231
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,840
You all right?

232
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,800
I'm a rubbish flyer myself.

233
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,360
I'm fine with flying.

234
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
I just didn't expect to be picked up
by a police officer.

235
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,040
Well, there's a bonus for you.

236
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,760
How do you know him? You couldn't
have worked on his case.

237
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,960
Why not?  It was in America.

238
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,400
His wife is from Surrey.
So you did work on his case?

239
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,080
No, just pointing that out.

240
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,600
Look in the glove box.

241
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,520
From Mr Grieff. You might want
to familiarise yourself.

242
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,800
Do police officers usually
carry cans of mace?

243
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
Oh, that's not for me.

244
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,640
Who's it for?
Anyone who wants it.

245
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,120
Do you want it?

246
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,680
No.  Good, then.

247
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,120
So Grieff wants me picked up from
the airport and he calls you?

248
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
What's your point?

249
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,600
Why is an English police officer

250
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,640
taking orders from an American
murderer on death row?

251
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,360
I'm not English.

252
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,360
Also, I'm not a police officer.

253
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,520
Coffee?

254
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,960
You coming?
Who are you?

255
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,640
Call me Morag.
Is it your name?

256
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,080
If you like.

257
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,480
Bring your homework, and the mace...

258
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,360
..if you're feeling nervous.

259
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,880
BUZZER, LOCK CLICKS

260
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,880
They'll take you to the holding
cell - you know, the Death House -

261
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,680
and you'll spend your last night
there. On the morning

262
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,800
of the big event,
they'll give you a chance

263
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,440
to make a written statement and
meet with members of your family.

264
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,800
Yeah, I know.

265
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,840
The warden briefed me.

266
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,480
Yeah, but you probably weren't
concentrating cos, you know,

267
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,000
you're going to die in three weeks.

268
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,640
I still am.

269
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,240
You've had time to adjust.

270
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,960
I've had four hours.

271
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,680
Four hours is a lot of time
when you only have three weeks.

272
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,840
How do you know all this stuff?

273
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,640
Photographic memory.

274
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,120
No. I mean when did you
first hear it?

275
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,560
When I was executed.

276
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,880
Dillon...  I know
what you're going to ask.

277
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,200
Yeah, there is a question
that's kind of springing to mind.

278
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,320
Why am I still alive?

279
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh, there it is.

280
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,480
Buddhism.

281
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,720
OK.  Buddhism.
I'm a Buddhist.

282
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
I converted in my first year.

283
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,240
OK, you're a Buddhist.

284
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,560
You see, back then,
when I was executed...  Dillon.

285
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,600
Yeah?  Point of order.  Mm-hm?

286
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
You were not executed.

287
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,680
Yeah, but back then,
you were allowed a faith person,

288
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,320
like a priest or whatever,
in the chamber with you. You know,

289
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,680
when they...moved you on.

290
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,800
But they didn't have legislation
for a Buddhist.

291
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,840
They had rabbis and priests
and whatnot, but no Buddhist.

292
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,880
I was two hours away from being
executed without the comfort

293
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,840
of a qualified Buddhist
touching my foot.

294
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,080
Your foot?  That's all they're
allowed to touch, your foot.

295
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,360
Why?  Well, priests,

296
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,640
and you know what I'm saying.

297
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,000
HE LAUGHS

298
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,760
Take it from a former altar boy.

299
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,440
Priests need limits.

300
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,640
OK. Thank you.

301
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,840
Why haven't I told you this before?

302
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,680
We don't share much, do we?

303
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,280
I don't like you.

304
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,760
Oh, yeah. Forgot about that.

305
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,560
Yeah.

306
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,120
I must be very stupid.

307
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,680
Why?

308
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,360
The card you showed me was fake,
yeah?  Not fake, no.

309
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,920
I mean, not mine.

310
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,680
I mean, man's name, man's photo.

311
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,240
I wasn't even trying that hard.

312
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,040
How did I not notice?

313
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,320
No-one ever does.
They're too busy thinking,

314
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,800
"Oh, no, it's the police."
Where did you get it from?

315
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,320
Well, from a police officer -

316
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,040
that's pretty much the only option.

317
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,520
How?
Took it right out his pocket.

318
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,320
Didn't notice a thing.

319
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,840
Which may have been because

320
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,440
I'd just smashed his head
all over the pavement.

321
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,360
And why did you do that?

322
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,760
He turned his back on me.
Didn't consider me a threat.

323
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,600
SHE SCOFFS
Everyday sexism.

324
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,480
OK. OK. So you're...

325
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,040
Actually, what are you?

326
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,920
I think we can safely say I'm a
criminal with a history of violence.

327
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,840
Oh, great.  Mainly into housebreaking
these days.

328
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,080
Time of life.
Prefer to work indoors.

329
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,320
So why would Grieff want you,
of all people,

330
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,160
to pick me up from the airport?

331
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,080
He wanted you kept safe.  He's got
a funny idea of how to do that.

332
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,920
He strangled his wife to death
and mutilated her corpse.

333
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,280
So, yeah, he has.

334
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,040
You read about the mutilation,
right?

335
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,960
He didn't just strangle her.

336
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,920
He mutilated her afterwards.

337
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,160
You know about that?

338
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,600
They kept a lot of it
out the papers.

339
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,960
I think they were still hoping
to find it.

340
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,920
Her head.

341
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,320
I think they were still hoping
they could find her head.

342
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,880
It was mentioned
in the trial coverage,

343
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,760
but people had lost interest
by then.

344
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,160
So that's who
you were sitting next to.

345
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,360
Not a man who lost his temper once -

346
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,640
a man who hacked his wife's head off
after she was dead,

347
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,080
and hid it,

348
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,720
and won't say where it is.

349
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,520
Oh, he's clever.

350
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,480
And he loves
solving his little puzzles

351
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,440
and talking to little girls like you
about atonement.

352
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,800
But the truth is -
and don't you forget this -

353
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,600
Jefferson Grieff is, was
and always will be a monster.

354
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,360
I know about the head.

355
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,320
I'm not a little girl,
I'm a fucking journalist.

356
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,880
I read everything.

357
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
Good, then.

358
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,120
All yours, Mr Grieff.

359
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,600
OVER PHONE:  Thank you, Morag.

360
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,840
Morag just wanted to know
that you were -

361
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,520
how shall I put this? -

362
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,080
that you were clear
on my...moral status.

363
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Do you feel clear?
I've always been clear.

364
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,000
That was my impression.
You disgust me.

365
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,040
What you did disgusts me.

366
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,880
I'm in this because of my friend,

367
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,560
and I'm starting to wonder why
I don't just go to the police.

368
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,600
When you leave a phone message
for Janice,

369
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,200
does she get back to you right away?
No, never. It can be days.

370
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,480
OK. Then, by all means,
go to the police.

371
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,200
But it will be a long time
before they have a legitimate reason

372
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
to consider her missing.

373
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,320
Fair point.

374
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,240
OK. When you meet for coffee,
is it always you who suggests it?

375
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,320
Yeah.

376
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,200
And does she always
take a while to reply?

377
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,440
Usually.  Looking at her Facebook,

378
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,920
she clearly has minimal
social contact.

379
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,600
I mean, she's currently resisting
the approaches of a personable

380
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,960
young woman who's taking
a flattering interest in her.

381
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,320
Basically...Janice
doesn't make friends.

382
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,080
See the problem?

383
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,080
Well, no.

384
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,200
How can there be anyone
who hates her enough to harm her

385
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,040
if she doesn't have friends?

386
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,440
You have a very strange view
of friendship.

387
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,800
So does Janice.

388
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,640
It could have been someone random.

389
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,760
She could have had an accident.

390
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,920
Yeah, but most of the time,
what happens to people

391
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,360
is other people,

392
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,280
and almost always
people they know.

393
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,160
So let's work on that assumption,
shall we?

394
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,520
Now, if she's alive -

395
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,640
IF she's alive - she's trapped.

396
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,320
And if she's trapped,

397
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,280
what is she doing right now?

398
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,400
How would I know?
Well, you know her.

399
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,040
She's clever, but afraid.

400
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,520
I think this is a woman
who understands.

401
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,400
And what she understands,
above all, is other people.

402
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,480
Why do you say that?

403
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,800
Because she avoids them.

404
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,560
All it takes to turn
any human being into a hermit

405
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,640
is a keen sense of smell.

406
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,800
I think if you had
a woman like that trapped,

407
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,520
helpless, fierce, clever,

408
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,600
back to the wall,
without hope,

409
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,080
I think you could be in for
a lot of trouble.

410
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,920
The police will be here shortly.

411
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,440
I'd like you to hear what they say.

412
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,280
I'd like that, too.

413
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,720
We're working on something.
We have an idea.

414
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,560
You must be terrified.

415
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,920
Why do you say that?
Police in your house

416
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,720
while you've got a woman
locked up in the cellar.

417
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,960
Well, it's not like
they'll be searching the place.

418
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,640
Promise me something.

419
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,960
What?

420
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm very scared.
I'd like you to make me a promise.

421
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,600
What promise?
That door's very thick -

422
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,520
I can't hear anything
from down here.  OK.

423
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,600
W-What I'm saying is,
I don't think you need to gag me.

424
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,320
Even if I shouted,
I don't think they could hear.

425
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,480
I couldn't bear it.
I'm already chained up.

426
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,080
I'm already pissing myself.

427
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,720
I don't even feel human.

428
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,800
Harry, don't please gag me.

429
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,280
You're right about that door.

430
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,000
I've been down here yelling
my lungs out.  So don't gag me.

431
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,760
Please don't.
I won't gag you.

432
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,680
Thank you, Harry.

433
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,160
Just...don't shout.
Don't do that again.

434
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,200
No, I won't shout, on my life.

435
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,840
Mary will be with you anyways.

436
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,040
Yeah, she'll keep me in line.

437
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,480
OK. We're just
figuring something out.

438
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,800
Mary will join you
before the police arrive.

439
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Thanks, Harry.

440
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,280
DOOR CLOSES

441
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,000
SHE MOANS

442
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,360
Fuck!

443
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,800
SHE SIGHS

444
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,400
In here?

445
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,760
I think so.

446
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,760
I suppose we need to do it this way.

447
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,880
Yeah, we do.

448
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,600
She has to hear it.

449
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,960
PHONE RINGS

450
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,680
Shelf.

451
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,320
I need something
to put in front of it.

452
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
This.  Oh, yes. Good.

453
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,600
DOORBELL RINGS

454
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,920
OK?

455
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,160
OK.

456
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,800
LOCK RATTLES

457
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,680
They're here.

458
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,120
Harry's going to talk to them
in his study.

459
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,680
We listen down here.

460
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,120
Oh, I've taped up
the microphone, just, you know...

461
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,240
In case I say anything
and they hear me.

462
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,360
Yeah.

463
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,680
What happened?

464
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh, it's nothing.

465
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,120
Your face!  Yes.

466
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,160
I-It's nothing.

467
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,680
You're bleeding!
Harry didn't hurt me.

468
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,120
Harry wouldn't do that.

469
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,600
Neither would I.

470
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,200
He's not like that, Harry.

471
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,800
You said you hated him.

472
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,480
We're always falling out.

473
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,360
You know what we're like.
SHE LAUGHS

474
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,520
But he would never hurt me.

475
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,040
Why not?

476
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,680
He just...

477
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,120
Well, he wouldn't.

478
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,040
What happened to your face?

479
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,560
I hurt myself sometimes
when I'm stressed -

480
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,440
it's just, you know, a thing.

481
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,640
Harry knows about it.

482
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,080
He never mentioned it.
Well, he wouldn't, it's personal.

483
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,280
He doesn't usually
keep secrets from me.

484
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,760
I'm sure he only keeps mine.

485
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,400
You should gag me.

486
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,800
I'm sorry?  The police are here.

487
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,880
You should gag me
in case I start shouting.

488
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,640
Why are you suggesting that?
Because I might panic and, if I do,

489
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,760
you might... I-I just don't want to
panic, that is all.

490
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,600
Nobody could hear you down here
anyway.

491
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,440
I know, but I'm not completely
rational at the moment,

492
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,520
and I'm nervous that, if I shout out
for help, I might provoke you.

493
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,000
But I-I'm not.

494
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,680
I'm not...  You are contemplating
whether or not you have to kill me.

495
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,680
I think you're capable
of hitting me.

496
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,000
Would you like some tea?

497
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,880
I've just boiled the kettle anyway.

498
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,920
That would be lovely.
Just milk in mine.  And mine.

499
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,800
ON SPEAKER:  Thanks, Harry.

500
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,280
Well, he's the vicar.
Everybody knows the vicar.

501
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,840
Everyone knows Harry.

502
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,000
You gave him the password
to your email account

503
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,320
so he could cancel the Skype call?

504
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,360
Yes.
You suggested the same thing to me.

505
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,080
Yes.

506
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,240
But you said you'd only give me
the password if I did something

507
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,400
for you in return.

508
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,440
Yes.

509
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,240
The trouble with you, Janice...

510
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,240
..is, because you're clever,

511
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,960
you think everybody else
is stupid.

512
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,040
You're playing us.

513
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,240
I'm now supposed to waste time
worrying about what my husband's

514
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,720
doing for you he's not telling me
about, right?

515
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,440
It's up to you what you
choose to worry about, Mary.

516
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,160
If Harry's right,

517
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,880
there could be a way
out of this, for all of us.

518
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,520
That's all I want.

519
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,720
A way out, with nobody hurt.

520
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,280
Well, it's all that I want.

521
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,000
Then listen. Just listen. Please.

522
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,320
There we go.  Thank you.

523
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,640
So...

524
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,600
So very sad about Edgar.

525
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,080
Yes, very sad. Poor Ed.

526
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,600
He was always very troubled, Edgar.

527
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,800
Not his first attempt, I'm afraid.

528
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,840
We're aware.

529
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,760
So...

530
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,280
..he left a note.

531
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,160
As I told you, yeah.
And the note mentions me.

532
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,040
As I said on the phone.

533
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,280
What did it say?

534
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,360
Can I just ask, sorry?

535
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,880
When I said that on the phone,
you seemed surprised.

536
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,840
Well,

537
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,320
anyone'd be surprised to be
mentioned

538
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,720
in someone's suicide note.
Wouldn't you?

539
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,480
No. I mean,

540
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,920
not if I was the last person
to see them alive.

541
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,160
Well, yes.  I'd be more sort
of worried.

542
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,960
I'd be thinking, "Oh, what did I
say?

543
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,240
"Was it something I said?"
I am worried, obviously.

544
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,880
Obviously. I can see you're worried.
I am, yeah.

545
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,200
Yes. But why?

546
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,000
I mean, specifically -
what did you say?

547
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,800
Oh, look, someone very close to
me...

548
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,920
..someone whom I felt responsible
for has just died.

549
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,320
Has just taken his own life.
So forgive me if I'm not...

550
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,760
..quite myself.

551
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,560
Of course. Of course. Sorry. Yeah.

552
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,440
I would like, if you don't mind,
to know what he said about me

553
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,800
in his note. Are you able to tell me
that?  Yeah.

554
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,600
Yeah, that's why we're here.

555
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,760
So you say.
Specifically why we're here.

556
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,920
Do you have the...?

557
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,000
So what WERE you talking about?

558
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,120
Well, it's personal.

559
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,480
Oh, of course.

560
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,760
Yeah. I think it's in the blue bit.

561
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,120
I know.
With the pocket.  I know.

562
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,080
Was it amicable?

563
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,560
I'm sorry?
Your conversation with Edgar.

564
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,520
Well, it was...erm...

565
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,280
Yeah.

566
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,600
I'd say it was, yeah, broadly.

567
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,120
Broadly amicable?

568
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,640
Yes.  Good.

569
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,920
Yeah.

570
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,960
It was just hard to tell
from the angle.

571
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,600
Angle?
The CCTV footage wasn't clear.

572
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,600
It's never very clear.
I don't know why we use it.

573
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,800
What footage?
Just some footage.

574
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,640
You and Edgar in the street.

575
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,160
You were in the car, he got in the
car. Nothing very much.

576
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,400
Oh, right. Yeah.  We were just trying
to establish Edgar's movements

577
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,160
after you collected him
from the pub.

578
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,320
Why did you do that, by the way?

579
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,560
Look...

580
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,720
..I don't know how much
you know about Edgar...

581
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,480
Oh, nothing.

582
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,240
Well...complicated story.

583
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,840
As I say, he has a troubled history.

584
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,320
He has...

585
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,360
..erm...

586
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,360
How shall I put it? Erm...

587
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,600
Erm, he has had, erm...

588
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,640
..certain...

589
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,000
..compulsions, ones he was trying
to control.

590
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,600
And I was...

591
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,640
I was...trying to help him.

592
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,480
Did he contact you
last night to talk?

593
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,000
Yes.  We'll have to talk to his
mother, she's very confused.

594
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,440
Confused?

595
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,920
She said you came to the door
looking for him and she directed

596
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,840
you to the pub where he was drinking
with friends.

597
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,920
He left a message earlier
and I assumed that I was meeting him

598
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,520
a-a-at his house.

599
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,880
Was he upset when he left
the message?

600
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,720
He was clearly anxious and...had
things he wanted to discuss.

601
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,080
Upsetting things?

602
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,000
Well, I mean, that's personal.

603
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,880
Personal, yeah.

604
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,800
But  I  assumed upsetting, yes.

605
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,200
I was aware of, erm...as I say,
his history.

606
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,560
So while he was waiting to discuss
these...upsetting things with you...

607
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,080
..he went to the pub with his
friends?

608
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,240
Apparently.

609
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,880
Or maybe he just forgot about it.

610
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,960
I don't know. I-I have no idea
why he did ever what he did.

611
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,560
Why ask me?

612
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,320
I know he was troubled.

613
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,640
I have some idea of the context.

614
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,280
Erm...

615
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,600
What I want to know, if it's all
right with you, is what he said

616
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,000
in his note.

617
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,720
What do you make of that, then?

618
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,040
"Don't believe the vicar
is a paedo.

619
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,160
"He's protecting someone else."

620
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,160
I've no idea what this means.

621
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,040
Oh, sorry.
It seems quite clear to me.

622
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,160
He thought you were protecting
a paedophile.

623
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,000
Are you expecting me to
explain to you that I'm not?

624
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, no, I wasn't expecting that.

625
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,320
Right, well...

626
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,160
But if you wouldn't mind.

627
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,320
Do you realise who the paedo in
question is he was referring to?

628
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,960
No.

629
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,000
Erm...

630
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,760
Do you know what his friends
call him?

631
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,560
Ask around, they'll tell you.
They called him Paedo.

632
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,200
Oh, do they? Hadn't heard that.

633
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,280
That's who I'm supposed to be
protecting. That's what he means.

634
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,240
It means I'm protecting him.

635
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,040
That's obvious, surely.

636
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,040
Well, no, it's...it's not really.
Yes, it is.

637
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,640
It's obvious. Don't you think?

638
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,680
ON SPEAKER:  Well, it's not exactly
obvious, no.

639
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,000
MUFFLED CRY

640
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,760
I mean, you're not protecting
him, are you?

641
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,080
You're telling us.

642
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,040
Yeah, but he's... It's...

643
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,080
I mean, he's...

644
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,120
Dead.

645
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,600
MUFFLED:  No, please!

646
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,520
MUFFLED SCREAM

647
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,880
I suppose a loss like this...

648
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,720
..hits people differently,
doesn't it?

649
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,320
Were you afraid?

650
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,520
When?
When they told you.

651
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,520
When they gave you
your execution date.

652
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,480
Are YOU scared?

653
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Well...I didn't expect to be.

654
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,000
I thought this is what you wanted.

655
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,440
No, no.

656
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,680
It's what I deserve.

657
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,280
Any thinking person is afraid
of what they deserve.

658
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,680
Mr Grieff, are you done
with the telephone?

659
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,920
Oh, yes.

660
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,200
Yes.

661
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,520
Thank you.

662
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,240
And could you give
that to the warden, please?

663
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,080
Could you bring it to him, please?

664
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,880
Will do, Mr Grieff.

665
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,960
What's next? What do we do now?
Where do we go?

666
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,800
Depends.  On what?

667
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,520
Mr Grieff says you're a journalist.

668
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,640
Yes.  A crime journalist.

669
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,840
That's mainly what I write about,
yeah.

670
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,360
Why?  People find it interesting.

671
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,560
People?

672
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,360
I  find it interesting.

673
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,480
How about car accidents?
Do you slow down for them too?

674
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,520
No.

675
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,440
The thing about crime, speaking as
a long-term practitioner,

676
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,840
it's a really stupid lifestyle
choice.

677
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,600
I mean, seriously, it's strictly
for the desperate.

678
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,760
It's...It's dangerous,

679
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,880
difficult to do well,
the money's shite.

680
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,640
And if you make any mistakes,
there's a good chance they'll

681
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,800
lock you up. Christ, you'd be better
off being a nurse.

682
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,880
So why is a posh wee thing
like you writing about crime?

683
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,800
Do you think it's funny?

684
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,640
I'm not posh.

685
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,920
Do you know what
you should write? Porn.

686
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,360
Why?  It'd be a step up!

687
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm not writing about this,
I'm trying to help someone.

688
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,840
That better be true.

689
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,640
Or what?

690
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,080
Or I'll develop a wee problem
with your attitude.

691
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,440
Shall we go, then?

692
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,720
SHE SIGHS

693
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,840
You look mumpy.  I look what?

694
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,200
Mumpy. It's just a word I use.

695
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,520
What's wrong with all the words
you've already got?  See?

696
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,920
Mumpy.

697
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,200
What's wrong?

698
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,840
Parents.

699
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,920
Yeah, well, your parents are weird.

700
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,520
How are they weird?

701
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,840
Your dad's a vicar.

702
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,080
You mum fucks a vicar.

703
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,520
SHE SCOFFS
It's just off the scale.

704
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,320
Coming to mine?  Yeah.

705
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,360
No.

706
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,280
You said you were.  I will,
later. Yeah.

707
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,400
I have to go home first.

708
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,440
Something wrong?
No. Maybe.

709
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,240
I don't know.

710
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,440
Did I do something?

711
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,920
No. No.
BIKE BELL DINGS

712
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,600
Just, I have to go home
and check something, OK?

713
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,720
LOCK RATTLES

714
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,240
She gave you her email
password, yeah?

715
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,600
Yeah.

716
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,640
What is it?

717
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,080
It's just "password."

718
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,000
Webmail.

719
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,880
What are you doing?

720
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,840
I can look in from my computer.

721
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,800
I'm cancelling her Skype call.

722
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,080
Then what?

723
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,400
She wasn't lying about her password
anyway.

724
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,560
THEN what?

725
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,440
We don't have a choice any more.

726
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,600
What are you going to do now?

727
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,760
There is no point in your big
confession.

728
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,920
They already think
you're protecting someone.

729
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,880
And the moment that woman leaves
that cellar, she will tell them who.

730
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,920
She'll tell them who.

731
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,240
You don't have a choice.

732
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,720
It's not our fault.

733
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,120
We have to do what we have to do.

734
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,440
What are you doing?

735
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,840
I need to talk to her.

736
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,680
Watch yourself. She's playing us.

737
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,880
She's terrified.

738
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,200
Yeah.
And she's a cold-hearted bitch.

739
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,760
And she's really, really clever.

740
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,840
DOOR CLOSES

741
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,920
MOANING

742
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,120
What happened?

743
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,000
SHE MOANS

744
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,160
Did Mary do this to you?

745
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,240
It's not her fault.
You're just so stressed.

746
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,920
She was panicking, that's all.

747
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,440
Did she hit you?

748
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,760
VOICE BREAKS:  No.

749
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,320
Did she?  S-She said to tell you
that I did it myself.

750
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,760
She hit you?

751
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,280
Just don't leave me alone with her!

752
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,160
She's going to kill me. I know she
is. She can't control herself.

753
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,600
Harry, please. I know that I'm safe
when I'm with you. I know I am.

754
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,120
J-Just don't leave me alone with
her!

755
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,280
Listen to me. I won't let her
kill you. On my soul,

756
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,640
as God is my witness,
I will not let her kill you.

757
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,760
Oh, I know. I know.

758
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,280
SHE SOBS

759
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,320
MOVEMENT UPSTAIRS

760
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,400
LOCK CLICKS

761
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,200
FRONT DOOR FLAPS

762
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,520
It's cold in the cellar.  Cold?

763
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,800
This will warm her up a bit.

764
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,720
Do you think it still works?

765
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,120
We stopped using that...

766
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,440
Yeah.  ..because it leaked.

767
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,640
Don't say it.  Sent off the sensor,
carbon monoxide.

768
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,920
You see, you didn't have to...

769
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,240
..say it.

770
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,840
If you use this in a sealed room...

771
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,640
I was hoping that you'd forgotten

772
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,760
and that it would be an honest
mistake.

773
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,920
But, no, you had to say it out loud.

774
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,240
Mary.

775
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,600
She'd just go to sleep.

776
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,440
It would be...painless.

777
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,960
She'd even be warm.

778
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,160
All we have to do is let it happen.

779
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,960
Just let it happen.

780
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,200
What's the alternative?

781
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,400
There isn't one.

782
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,640
There ISN'T one.

783
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,720
LOUD:  Harry, you know what will
happen

784
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,440
if that woman leaves the cellar.

785
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,360
Did you hit her?

786
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,720
No.

787
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,840
That cut on her face, SHE did that.

788
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,040
Harry, she's trying to turn us
against each other.

789
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,720
It's not going to work.

790
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,360
Is it going to work on you?

791
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,680
DOOR HANDLE RATTLES

792
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,640
Did you read it?

793
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,760
Read what?  My email.

794
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,480
I'll read it back to you.

795
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,080
Listen carefully, in case
I've made any mistakes.

796
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,480
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

797
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,640
"Hello, Cath."

798
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,760
She always calls her Cath,
never Catherine.

799
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,400
And she always starts with hello.
I've checked her other emails.

800
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,840
"Do you mind if I skip the Skype
tonight?"

801
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,320
It's always skip -
she's cancelled before.

802
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,240
"I'm in bed already, and so tired.

803
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:14,480
"Off on a walking trip and
my phone is broken, so I probably

804
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,480
"won't be in touch for a week.

805
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,120
"Till then, take care.
Janice."

806
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,160
What do you think?

807
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,880
She should send love.

808
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,000
She never does,
it's always take care.

809
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,280
Probably the last time her sister
ever hears from her.

810
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,760
She never sends love.

811
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,560
It's not my fault.

812
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,400
This is...

813
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,080
..a thing that is
happening...to us.

814
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,000
No-one will suffer.

815
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,440
Not even Janice.

816
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,480
WHISPERS:  Harry...

817
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,760
..this is humane.

818
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,960
Must be so much easier.

819
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,600
What must?  Not believing
in hell.

820
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,880
I am in hell, right now.

821
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,120
But I think I can see a way out.

822
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,240
You see, that's the problem -

823
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,320
there never is.

824
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,800
There never is a way out.

825
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,720
Christ.

826
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,800
We're actually
going to do this, aren't we?

827
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,400
Send the email.

828
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,200
Harry?

829
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,760
Harry, have you bolted the door?

830
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,160
I've bolted both doors.
You can't get in.

831
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,400
What are you doing?
Go to Sally's.

832
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Go to your mother's.
Go wherever you like.

833
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,040
Here's your car keys.

834
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,760
You're not coming in here.

835
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,720
Harry...
Mary, listen to me.

836
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,240
I'm not going to let you kill her.
It's not going to happen.

837
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,080
Harry. Harry!  Now, go.
Just go.  Harry...

838
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,080
Harry!

839
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,360
BUZZER, LOCK CLICKS

840
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,280
You can leave us.

841
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,640
Yes, sir.

842
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,960
DOOR CLOSES

843
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,160
Are you serious?

844
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,600
Perfectly.

845
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,480
All of a sudden, you're going to
tell us, after all this time?

846
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,880
There's a condition.
Ah.

847
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,080
Can't be done.

848
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,520
Executions have been rescheduled
before.

849
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,440
Many of them have been delayed
indefinitely.

850
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,440
I'm sure there's a lawyer
somewhere who can do something.

851
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,440
And in return?

852
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,440
And in return, I will tell

853
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,360
anybody who wants to know...

854
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,280
..where my wife's head is.

855
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,000
Gordon and Marie can bury
their daughter whole.

856
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,080
At last.

857
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,400
That's not enough.

858
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,600
That's not all there is.

859
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,760
Once I explain where I buried
the head...

860
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,760
..it will become clear
why I did it...

861
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,120
..and why she had to die.

862
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,520
Then Gordon and Marie will know,

863
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,560
you will know.

864
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,720
And everybody...will know.

865
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,760
But first...

866
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,400
..I want to live.

867
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,320
Somehow, I know I'm going to
be OK with you.

868
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,320
Erm...

869
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,760
..I don't know what to do yet.
I need...

870
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,280
I need to think. I need to go and
think.

871
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,800
Of course you do.

872
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,680
I got Mary out of here
for her sake.

873
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,640
I don't want her to be any part
of this.

874
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,080
Just like I locked you up
for Ben's sake.

875
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,120
I have done bad things,

876
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,200
wrong things, but I did them.

877
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,200
I'm doing them for my family.

878
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,000
Well, you'd do anything for your
family. I know that.

879
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,040
You'd die for them.

880
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,880
More than that, I would
take their place in hell.

881
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,680
DOOR CLOSES

882
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,040
Well? You're not saying much.

883
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,160
The fuck is he doing?

884
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,840
What are my parents doing?

885
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,000
Why didn't you ask him?

886
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,240
I-I wasn't expecting you to stay
hiding.

887
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,080
I couldn't.

888
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,880
I don't know, I just...
You froze.

889
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,000
Well, no-one expects to hear their
father talking like that.

890
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,760
What'd he mean, for my sake?

891
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,840
What has it got to do with me?

892
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,000
Ask him.

893
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,880
I'm going to.

894
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,200
LOCK RATTLES

895
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,560
Shit.

896
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,000
What's the matter?  It's jammed.

897
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,720
He's fucking jammed the lock with
something and I can't open it.

898
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,840
Dad?!

899
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,440
Oh, shit.

900
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,200
Shit!

901
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,480
Dad?

902
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,520
Dad?

903
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,120
BANGING CONTINUES
Dad?!

904
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,720
Oh, where the fuck is he?

905
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,200
DAD!

For God's sake, phone me back!

915

PHONE ME BACK!

916
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,200
She fucked us.

917
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,600
She did it on purpose

918
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,720
and she fucked us.

919
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,560
The email.
I got it all wrong.

920
