1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,640
This programme contains
scenes which some viewers
may find upsetting,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,080
deals with suicide and contains
some strong language.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,360
Why do you care about this?

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,800
She's a good friend of mine.
She's missing.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,480
I think she could be in danger.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,320
It would help if you didn't lie.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,520
Thank you.  I'm not lying.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,200
The previous text,
the one you sent her.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,280
Dillon.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,120
Coffee, when I'm back? Beth X.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,680
You're not friends.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,960
Serial acquaintances at best.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,600
Because I cancelled a coffee?

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,280
Because you signed the text.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,160
Good friends know that their number
is in the address book.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,880
The truth, please. Come on.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,240
I know her.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,040
I respect and admire her.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,200
Over the last six months, we've met
several times for coffee.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,320
During that time, I've got to know
her well enough

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,680
that I'm pretty sure that picture
was a cry for help.

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,560
I think it's probably significant

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,440
that I was the person
she sent it to.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,920
Or the last person, who just
happened to text her.

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,440
What did the police say?

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,880
I haven't spoken to them.

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,400
You thought your story
would sound flimsy.

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,600
Yes, I suppose.  So...

29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,320
..instead of going to the police,

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,040
here you are, consulting a convicted
murderer on death row,

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,960
who, only hours earlier,
you attempted to interview

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,640
for the reading pleasure of the
recreationally outraged.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,680
I'm glad you're not my friend.

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,120
I think we're both glad about that.

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,360
HE LAUGHS

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,680
Well, it's all getting a bit rude
in here.

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,160
From a man who made a magazine rack
out of a librarian's ribcage.

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,520
No, I didn't. I didn't.

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,040
Janice Fife.  It was a nurse.

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,600
Janice Fife is a good person, who I
think might be in trouble,

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,480
so I thought you might be
interested.

42
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,080
Moral worth, that's what you want in
your cases.

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,040
Atonement.

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,520
You know, sorry to have
bothered you.

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,720
No, wait, please! Please.

46
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,320
It was a librarian...  Dillon.

47
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,040
..but it was a drying rack.  Quiet!

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,280
Copy that.

49
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,800
You thought your friend's possible
disappearance was an opportunity

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
to watch me in action and write
about it?

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,840
That's right, isn't it?  Which, in
all fairness, was quite clever.

52
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,000
No, that's not why I'm here.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,880
OK. All right, OK.

54
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,320
Let me make you an offer.

55
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm a man of my word, as Dillon will
confirm.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,400
He is a man of his word.

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
I'll allow you to observe
my next case.

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,520
For example, his wife...  Dillon.

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,880
Till death do us part.

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,200
Would you mind?

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,920
Sh.

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,840
I'll allow you to observe my next
case, and even write about it,

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,040
but on one condition.

64
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,640
Being?

65
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,480
I will not take the case of your
missing friend Janice

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,840
and I never want to hear you speak
of her again.

67
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
Why?  Do you agree?

68
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,000
Do you have another case?
There's a case coming in, today.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,720
Today?  Today, yes.

70
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,920
My promise.

71
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,760
You can sit in on my next case.

72
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,240
You can write every word you want
to write about it.

73
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,440
You can even call me The Death Row
Detective, I won't stop you.

74
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,920
But only...

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
..only...

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,040
..on the absolute binding condition

77
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,120
that there is no more talk of your
missing friend.

78
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,320
Not one word.

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,680
Is this a test to see if I'll sell
my friend down the river?

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,960
Will you?

81
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,400
Christ, you're an evil piece
of shit, aren't you?

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,040
I'm under sentence of death
for strangling my wife.

83
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,920
Of course, I'm an evil piece
of shit.

84
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,800
The question is, Beth...

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,280
..are you?

86
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,960
Mm.

87
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
With these hands.

88
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,520
OK.

89
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,800
OK what?

90
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,960
I'll sit in on your case.

91
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
I won't mention Janice again.

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Your friend, Janice.

93
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,720
Yeah.  Yeah.

94
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,000
Your best friend, Janice.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,640
Yes.

96
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,040
Poor Janice.

97
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,920
OK.

98
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,160
I'll speak to the warden.

99
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,480
You'll need to be back in this room
in one hour.

100
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,120
# You may run home for a long time

101
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,640
# Run home for a long time

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,560
# You may run home for a long time

103
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,280
# I tell you
God Almighty's going to cut you down

104
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,280
# Great God Almighty's
going to cut you down

105
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,920
# Oooh

106
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,360
# Oooh

107
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,560
# You can run home for a long time

108
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,400
# I tell you
God Almighty's going to cut you down

109
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,120
# Good God Almighty's
going to cut you down. #

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,080
You're allowed to keep the lights
on, you know?

111
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,480
Oh, that's nice.

112
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,800
Nice to be allowed.

113
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,200
I turned them off, so my eyes could
adjust to the dark.

114
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,040
I thought it might be an advantage
in the circumstances.

115
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,320
Look, sorry, but there's a...

116
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,920
..pipe just beside you there.

117
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,880
So?

118
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,880
You just, sort of, you know...

119
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,920
What?

120
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,240
Attach yourself. Sorry.

121
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,520
Why?

122
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,960
I only want to talk to you. Just...

123
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,160
..chat.

124
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,920
Do you always bring handcuffs
to a chat, Vicar?

125
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,760
Hah.  It's not funny.

126
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,920
Not when I'm sitting down here
in my own piss.

127
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,480
It's not funny, Harry.

128
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,520
I'm sorry about this. Ben will be
back soon.

129
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,880
I just want to make sure that...

130
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,640
..you don't, you know.
Make a nuisance of myself.

131
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,280
I really am sorry.

132
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,600
Where did you get the handcuffs?

133
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,960
We're going to sort this out.

134
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,080
We are reasonable people,
who just got themselves,

135
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,480
through no fault of our own,

136
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,920
into a completely unreasonable
situation.

137
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,400
Are they yours, the handcuffs?

138
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,160
We need to take a step back from
this whole stupid business.

139
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,800
Oh, no, are they a toy?

140
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,400
Oh, I hope you haven't used them.
They're just...

141
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,280
No, they're just a present.
A sort of...

142
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,640
..joke present, when we got married.
Of course.

143
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,120
But nothing dirty. Oh, no!

144
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,880
Just like the child pornography

145
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,720
on your son's flash drive was
nothing to do with him.

146
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,560
You better have cleaned these.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,280
Sorry, can you just...

148
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,480
..click, click, click.

149
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,880
It wasn't Ben's.

150
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,160
What you saw, it truly wasn't.

151
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,640
Here we go again.

152
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,840
If I say I believe you,
will you believe me?

153
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,080
Can I go, then?

154
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,240
No, of course not.

155
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,280
I brought you some bed clothes.

156
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,320
Why?

157
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,360
I just...

158
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,200
There's no reason this has to be
uncivilised.

159
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,200
Can you get me some plastic bags...
What for?

160
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,600
..and some loo paper?

161
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,720
Can you do that? Some plastic bags
and some loo paper, please, Vicar?

162
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,960
Yes, of course.

163
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,760
You put your collar back on.

164
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,280
Yes.

165
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,240
Why? You're home from work, now.

166
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
Is the collar for me?

167
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,720
It's always strangely disgusting,
isn't it,

168
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,680
when someone's so keen to be
trusted?

169
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,400
The collar isn't for you,
it's for me.

170
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,600
It's a reminder that I have
standards to live up to.

171
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
Seeing as you have such standards,
Vicar,

172
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,080
can I remind you of one
tiny little thing?

173
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,720
You have no right to keep me here!

174
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,720
It's only till I can prove to you
that I'm telling the truth.

175
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,800
Oh, OK.

176
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,040
9pm tomorrow evening,

177
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,200
Skype call with my sister.

178
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,400
I never miss it
without a very good reason.

179
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,000
And like I said, that's when
they'll start looking for me.

180
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,680
By 9pm tomorrow, you will be home.

181
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,920
This will be over.

182
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,600
Leave the lights on, please.

183
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,280
Hey.

184
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,240
You OK?

185
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,720
I've been thinking,
just theoretically,

186
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,040
about how you actually kill someone.

187
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,920
Jesus!  No, listen, viewing this
as a practical problem,

188
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,720
how do you physically, on purpose,
actually, make someone die?

189
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,120
Have you ever thought about that?
No!

190
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,600
And I'm not thinking about it, now.

191
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,640
See, in the movies,

192
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,760
it's all about the alibi and getting
rid of the body

193
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,960
and, fair enough, you know, those
things need doing,

194
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,000
but how do you kill a person
in the first place?

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,040
I mean, in cold blood.

196
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,960
What works? What do you use?

197
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,800
How do you know when you're
finished?

198
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,320
What if they don't cooperate?

199
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160
I am not...

200
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,480
..drunk!

201
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,680
You're being emotional.

202
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,320
Don't you dare talk to me like that.

203
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,920
GLASS CLINKS

204
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,880
If she leaves this house,

205
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
she will go straight to the police.

206
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
We don't know that.  She has no
choice!

207
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
Of course, she does.

208
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,800
There's a paedophile being protected
by his father, the local vicar.

209
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,000
Do you think she's just going to
forget about that?

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
You assaulted her.

211
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
Do you think she's just going to let
bygones be bygones?

212
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,600
Would you bet your son's whole
future on it?

213
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,280
If she leaves this house, she has no
choice but to go to the police,

214
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,680
so we have no choice but to stop her
leaving.

215
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,160
How are we going to do that?

216
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,880
That is the only question.

217
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,200
The porn wasn't Ben's.

218
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,920
So, any investigation - if there
ever is one - would prove that.

219
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,800
After everyone knows.

220
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,480
After we keep our son home from
school

221
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,400
because they're kicking
the shit out of him

222
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,160
and we've got a policeman
on the door,

223
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,440
who doesn't even want to be there,
after the headlines.

224
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,400
What headlines?  What headlines?

225
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,840
The paedo teenager with his dad,
the violent vicar,

226
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,400
who threw a woman down the stairs
to protect the evil family secret.

227
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,720
Urgh!

228
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,160
Tabloids would have the biggest
collective orgasm

229
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,760
since Meghan met Oprah,

230
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,200
and all of it, all of that becomes
inevitable

231
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,280
the moment she leaves this house.

232
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,680
So, what are we going to do?!

233
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,520
SHE SOBS

234
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,600
Come on.

235
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,680
We're not out of options yet.

236
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,240
Let's stay calm and consider them.

237
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,080
What options?  For a start,
I'm going to talk to Edgar.

238
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,320
That won't work.  Well, I...I think
it will.

239
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,800
Let me try.

240
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,320
Do you know what I've been doing?

241
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,880
Drinking.

242
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,280
I've been Googling.

243
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,160
Googling what?

244
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,200
Let me tell you something
ridiculous.

245
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,520
We're supposed to be this murderous,
warlike species, yeah?

246
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,640
Well, explain this -

247
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,600
why isn't there a single web page
out there

248
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,560
explaining how you kill a person?

249
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,120
The Internet, it's just all sex.

250
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,760
WHISPERS:  Every kind of sex.

251
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,680
Not one handy hint on how you kill
a human being,

252
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,640
but there's a suggested kitchen
implement for every size of anus.

253
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,840
According to the internet,
we're crazy about each other.

254
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,960
It's non-stop action.

255
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
No wonder this planet
keeps spinning.

256
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,280
I looked up execution methods.

257
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,440
I got bondage dungeons.

258
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,240
Funny.  Funny.

259
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,040
It's funny, you think?

260
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm going to find Edgar.

261
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,720
I won't be long.

262
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,960
Stay calm.

263
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,280
Stay out of the cellar.

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,720
Congratulations.

267
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,520
Some people say real estate
is boring.

268
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,600
Me, for instance, I say that
all the time.

But tonight, you know what I think?

271
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,400
I think it's still boring,
but now, I've got an award.

272
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
CROWD:  Hey-hey!

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,400
If I'd known I was going to win
an award like this tonight,

274
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,640
I'd have brought my car. It's heavy.

275

LAUGHTER

276
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Now, listen, seriously.

277
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,280
There are a lot of people
I've got to thank.

278
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,840
You know who you are.

279
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,640
So, do me a favour,
call out your names

280
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,680
cos I forgot you all the minute
I got this award.

You got no respect.

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,080
Oh, thank you, ladies.

286
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,920
I'll be round to see you all later.

287
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,240
Save a high note for me.

288
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
Those things he says,
he doesn't mean it.

289
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
He was always like that.

290
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,120
He's funny.  He's always funny.

OK.

Thank you, ma'am.

296
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,000
And that was the last time
anyone saw him?

297
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,880
Walked off the stage,
never seen again. Just vanished.

298
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,640
When was this?  Five years ago.

299
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,720
No, I'm sorry - time of day.

300
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,440
When in the day?

301
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,240
According to the timer on the video,
it says just before 8pm.

302
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,200
Is that accurate?  I think so.

303
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,440
I wasn't there.

304
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,480
He said I didn't have to go.

305
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,240
Was there a party afterwards
or dinner?

306
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,600
I'd been before.
He was always winning things.

307
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,960
Yeah. No. Yes, of course.

308
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,520
No, I understand completely.

309
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,280
But was it a party afterwards or...?

310
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
I should have been there.

311
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,960
But you weren't there.

312
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,440
And now you're here.

313
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Tell me.

314
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,680
There was going to be a drinks thing
on the balcony over the river.

315
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,480
Where he never appeared.

316
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,520
Mr Grieff, we're told
you have special powers.

317
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,920
No, I have a doctorate
in criminology.

318
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,240
And a murder conviction.

But you see things other
people can't see.

321
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,080
Mainly the interior walls
of this prison.

322
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,680
Did you persuade your mother
to come here today?

323
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,480
No-one else is interested any more.

324
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,800
Yeah.  I heard about you, Mr Grieff.

325
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,360
I thought maybe you could help us.

326
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,200
We just want to know where he is.

327
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,360
Where did he go?

328
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,560
Well, where he went is fairly
obvious from the video, I think,

329
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,320
or will be once we get ahold
of some train schedules,

330
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,840
but where he is now...

331
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,880
..that's a little more complicated.

332
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,520
How is where he went obvious?

333
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Observation.  Of what?

334
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,720
No idea, but it's
usually observation.

335
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,600
But nobody knows where he went.

336
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,720
Nobody saw him.

337
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,560
Yeah, no. Nobody at all.

338
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,080
That's the point.

339
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,840
Tells us everything.

340
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,880
How?

341
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,360
You love him, don't you?

342
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,320
Well, yes.

343
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,240
You still laugh at his jokes.

344
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,320
You check to see if
everyone else is laughing, too.

345
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,280
You love your husband?

346
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,840
Of course I do.

347
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,520
And he loved you?

348
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,960
I always thought so.

349
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,280
Oh, I'm sure of it.

350
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,120
It's not fashionable to say so,
but husbands usually

351
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,280
love their wives and wives
usually love their husbands.

352
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,960
Love is very common,
but never commonplace.

353
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,800
If you know where he went,
if somehow you know that...

354
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,240
..please tell me.

355
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,720
I have a theory...

356
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,960
..but I'm not ready
to share it just yet.

357
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,400
Beth, will you take
Hannah's hands, please?

358
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,320
Why?  Because I can't...

359
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,560
CHAIN RATTLES

360
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,120
..and we're about to have a
difficult conversation.

361
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,840
Hannah, have you given any
thought to the possibility

362
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,080
that I might actually
find your husband?

363
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,480
Because after five years,
he's almost certainly dead.

364
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,880
Well, at least we would know.

365
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,200
Yeah.

366
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,560
Knowing would be something.

367
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,720
It'd be...

368
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,800
It'd be better than what we have
at the moment.

369
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,680
And what you have
at the moment is...

370
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,840
..hope?

371
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,120
Yeah.

372
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,200
Hope's awful.

373
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,280
Yeah.

374
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,520
I suppose it is.

375
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,480
As far as I remember.

376
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,320
Thank you.

377
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,440
So what was that?

378
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Are you showing off or do
you actually have a theory?

379
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,720
Could be both.

380
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,160
It's usually both.
OK, so tell me your theory.

381
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,000
No. You saw what I saw.

382
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,040
Tell me yours.

383
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,200
I saw a man get an award
and give a bad speech.

384
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,480
And then?

385
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,840
He disappeared into the night.

386
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,160
No, he didn't.

387
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,680
That's exactly what didn't happen.

388
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,440
Look at the video
properly this time.

389
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,720
It's all there.

390
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,920
Just before 8pm on the
25th of July is not night.

391
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,560
That's a half-hour before sunset.

392
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,400
He walked off into broad daylight.

393
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,160
So what?

394
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,280
So everything.

395
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,480
You have a car, I presume?

396
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,520
Mm-hm.

397
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,640
Would you mind doing
some research for me?

Ah.  Oh, vicar.

401
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,200
To what do I owe the pleasure?

402
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,240
Actually, I was looking
for Edgar. Is he around?

403
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,280
No. No, he's, er...
He's out with his friends.

404
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,680
Good. So he should be.

405
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,560
Do you happen to know where he went?
I need to speak to him.

406
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,880
He's got his phone.

407
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,960
In person.

408
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,680
Has he done something wrong?

409
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,040
If he's done something wrong,
I'm happy to get involved.

410
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,720
Do you know where he went?

415
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,520
Eileen.

416

LAUGHTER

417
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,080
He don't get it.

418
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,960
Sorry, I've just got...
Yeah, it's fine. Yeah.

419
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,160
Hi. Is there a problem?

420
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Is it the church?
Is it a church thing?

421
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,040
Those your friends?
Yeah. The guys.

422
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,880
Just...the guys.  Good.

423
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,560
Good to see you hanging
out with people.

424
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,880
They come here a lot.

425
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,040
I join in.

426
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm getting good at that,
joining in.

427
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,560
I don't take no for an answer.

428
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,600
THEY CHUCKLE

429
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,480
That's great, Ed. Good for you.

430
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,440
You said I had to meet
people my own age.

431
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,560
Yeah, your own age.

432
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,520
Do you want it back?

433
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,760
The flash drive, Ed. Do you?

434
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,720
The one you were hiding
from your mother.

435
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,800
You gave it to me at the church,
remember?

436
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,200
Your porn.

437
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,800
You were hiding your porn.

438
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,920
I won't tell your friends about it,
it's all right.

439
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,320
Or your mother.

440
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,040
I just want to know
if you want it back.

441
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,280
I...

442
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,440
What?

443
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,720
What is it?

444
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,120
What?

445
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,160
Did you...?

446
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,360
Did I what?

447
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,120
Oh, come on, it's me.

448
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,800
You're safe with me.
You know that, don't you?

449
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,760
Look. Here. Come on.

450
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,360
Don't want your friends
to see you like that, do you?

451
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,800
What I'm asking is...

452
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,960
..do you want this back?

453
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,360
Your flash drive -
do you want it back?

454
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,200
That's not mine.

455
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,880
No, it is. You gave it to me

456
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,320
earlier at the church.

457
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,200
It's fine. You're embarrassed.
Your mum was looking for you.

458
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,280
You gave it to me. I'm just
returning your property to you.

459
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,120
It's not mine.
I've never seen that before.

460
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,920
Edgar, why are you lying to me?

461
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm not lying to you.

462
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,080
I'm not. Why are you
saying that's mine?

463
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,680
That's not mine.

464
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,840
You gave this to me.

465
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,120
No, I didn't.

466
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,200
I didn't!

467
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,280
Edgar, you're lying.
You are! You're lying!

468
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,880
Wait, just...  I'm going home.

To help you.

473
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,040
Where are we going?  Church.  Why?

474
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,080
Because I'm a fucking vicar.

475
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,560
How many phone calls
are you allowed?

476
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,480
I have a particular arrangement.

477
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,720
Cosy.

478
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,160
Not especially.

479
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,760
Did you look at the footage again?

480
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,840
A man in a tux gave a speech
and walked off the stage.

481
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,000
What about the audience?

482
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,920
I get it. He was the only
one wearing a tux. So what?

483
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,520
How far are you from Allenville?

484
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,720
Four miles.

485
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,840
Coming up on your right,
there's a sign.

486
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,880
Barney B's.  Yeah, OK.

487
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,040
Go see Barney.
He's got something for you.

488
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,880
What?  Call me from Allenville.

489
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,120
SHE SIGHS

490
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,080
Excuse me. I'm looking for Barney.

491
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,680
In the back.  Thank you.

492
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,280
Erm, Barney?

493
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,520
Barney!

494
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,840
Beth Davenport?

495
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,040
One sec.

496
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,520
What do I do with this?

497
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,040
You deliver it.  Where?

498
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,640
Wherever Mr Grieff says.

499
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,560
Thank you for this.

500
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,880
Oh, hey.

501
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,640
You get a message to Mr Grieff
if you're talking to him.

502
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,720
What message?

503
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,600
You tell him the subject's meant to
make a Skype call at 9pm tomorrow,

504
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,480
and that's 4pm our time.

505
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,520
OK.  OK.

506
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,120
But is that another case for
Mr Grieff?

507
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,320
Yeah. Yeah, it's a case.

508
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,800
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

509
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,760
I thought it was time we talked.

510
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,800
Probably, yes.

511
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,880
MARY SIGHS

512
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,840
Should I have brought you a glass?

513
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,120
I'd rather drink from the same glass
as you, if you don't mind.

514
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
What, you think
I'm going to drug you?

515
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,640
Well, it'd be the clever thing
to do in your situation.

516
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,200
Better than a golf club, anyway.

517
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,640
Yeah.

518
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,240
Keep it.

519
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,880
So...

520
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,720
What happens now, do you think?

521
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,800
I think in the end -
and with regret, I'm sure -

522
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,560
I think you're going to kill me.

523
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,040
It sounds dramatic,
I know, but people do do that.

524
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,320
People kill people. It happens.

525
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,640
And I can't think of any other
way out of this, can you?

526
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,240
So, have you given any thought

527
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,600
to how you're going
to get away with it?

528
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,880
Away with what?

529
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,920
My murder.

530
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,000
You must've been
thinking about it, surely.

531
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,560
No.

532
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,120
The killing itself is easy.

533
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,160
Is it?

534
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,760
You would have googled it, I'm sure.

535
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,120
It wouldn't be pleasant,
of course, but not difficult,

536
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,240
I wouldn't have thought.

537
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,600
You just have to be strong.

538
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,360
I think you're very strong, Mary.

539
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,120
Especially when it comes to Ben.
I've always like that about you.

540
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,520
I love my son.

541
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,440
If I doubted that,
I'd be a lot less scared.

542
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,360
This situation...

543
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,920
Nobody wants this.

544
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,280
I can help you.

545
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,640
Sorry?  I...can...help...you.

546
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,680
What do you mean, help me?

547
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,000
Help me with what?

548
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,280
I've been sitting
down here thinking,

549
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,720
I don't have a lot
to bargain with, do I?

550
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,760
Except this...

551
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm the only person
in the entire world

552
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,840
who can help you get away
with my murder.

553
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,960
I'm sorry, but I-I...

554
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,160
I-I don't...

555
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,440
What?  I have a Skype call tomorrow
at 9pm with my sister.

556
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,040
I never miss it without
warning her in advance.

557
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,040
The moment I don't call, it starts.

558
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,080
First, my sister wonders where I am.

559
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,120
She asks my friends.
They don't know.

560
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,400
And then I won't get
back home that night.

561
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,080
Then the search
will begin in earnest.

562
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,920
The police will get
access to my flat -

563
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,680
my neighbours have the keys -
and they'll find a diary on my desk,

564
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,280
at which point they will discover
that my last appointment

565
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,440
was here in this house
with your son.

566
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,280
When they get here,
what are they going to find?

567
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,320
If they find me locked up
in your cellar,

568
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,440
I'm going to tell them
everything that happened.

569
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,920
Your husband will be arrested
for assault and your son

570
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,480
will be exposed as a paedophile.

571
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,840
That is never going to happen!

572
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,800
All of this becomes inevitable
from 9pm tomorrow.

573
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,600
Unstoppable, like maths.

574
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,840
Unless...

575
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,040
Unless what?

576
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,000
Unless I email my sister
and cancel the Skype call.

577
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,040
Why would you do that?
I'd have to send the email.

578
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,840
Well, it would have
to come from my account.

579
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,040
Suppose you could write it.

580
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,320
You'd have to be very careful
with the wording, though -

581
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,640
people are going to be very
suspicious when I go missing.

582
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,320
I suppose I could help you with
that.  Why would you help us?

583
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,880
Now, here's the clever part.

584
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,080
In the email, it could mention
that I'm going on a walking trip.

585
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,880
I go on those quite often,
about a week usually.

586
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,760
No contact with anyone.

587
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,360
I really don't understand.

588
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,600
My phone's broken.

589
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,760
That's true, as it happens,
thanks to your husband,

590
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,360
so there'd be no way to track me
or contact me during that week.

591
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,160
Why would you help us?
Oh, never mind that.

592
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,680
The point is, I can make
this easier for you.

593
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,760
You keep Ben safe and
get away with murder.

594
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,880
But only...only if I help you.

595
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,040
I have a Webmail account -

596
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,080
you already know the address,
so you just need my email password.

597
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,240
So...

598
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,200
Make me an offer.

599
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,360
An offer?

600
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,520
Well, I have something
that you want.

601
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,360
What do you have that I want?

602
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,560
Nothing!

603
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,880
Everything.

604
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,520
My life, my freedom,
my friends, my family.

605
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,880
Everything that I will never
see again because of you.

606
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,560
But you can't offer me that,
can you?

607
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,440
So, Mary, what else have you got?

608
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,040
Make me an offer.

609
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,520
You just think about it.

610
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,880
I'm tired. I'd like to sleep now.

611
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,400
This just doesn't make any sense.
Thank you for the drink.

612
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,160
I don't... I don't understand
what you expect me to do.

613
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,480
Well, that's not my problem, is it?

614
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,680
That's your problem, not mine.

615
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,840
Oh, I'm really very tired now.

616
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,040
It'd be kind if you
could leave the whisky.

617
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,720
By the way, mention a word
of this to your husband,

618
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,280
no password.

619
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,240
This is between you and me.

620
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,520
Tell the vicar what we talked
about and I won't help you.

621
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,480
Why?

622
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,120
Because I hate him.

623
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,960
I've never really liked him,

624
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,920
though I'm sure he thought I did,
but now...

625
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,000
SHE GASPS

626
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,880
..now I really hate him.

627
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,920
So keep that in mind.

628
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,400
Keep in mind how much I hate
your husband when you're wondering

629
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,000
what you can do for me.

630
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,160
Goodnight, Mary.

631
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,640
Leave the light on, please.

632
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,240
Have a good think.

633
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,480
Goodnight.

634
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,840
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

635
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,360
LOCK CLICKS

636
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,160
Why'd you lock the cellar?

637
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,080
Hi, Ben.

638
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,120
I thought...

639
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,640
How was the festival?

640
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,160
Yeah, a bit shit.

641
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,920
I just, erm...

642
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,320
Just locked it.

643
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,000
I don't know why.

644
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,520
Janice is still here, then?

645
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,640
No. No, of course not.

646
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,480
Why would she still be here?

647
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,320
I mean, that's her handbag, I think.

648
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,400
Sh-she must have...
she must have left it.

649
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,640
I'll phone her and tell her.

650
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,600
I-I'll tell her that it's...
it's here.

651
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,760
Don't worry about it.

652
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,240
No, I will. I-I-I'll phone
her and I-I'll tell her.

653
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,800
I'll do it.  No, I will!

654
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,480
Need to talk to her anyway.

655
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,360
Hey, Janice, give me a call
when you get this.

656
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,520
You left your handbag here.

657
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,040
And anyway, still don't
have those modules.

658
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,120
Sorry about earlier,
Mum and Dad being weird...

659
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,480
Why are you dressed like that?

660
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,920
I'm at work.

661
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,400
No, you're not.

662
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,920
Take a pew.

663
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
EDGAR CHUCKLES

664
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,160
Ed, take a pew.

665
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,840
I know what's on this.

666
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,520
I don't.

667
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,040
Yes, you do.

668
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,200
Never seen it before.

669
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,600
You're lying.  No, I'm not.

670
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,160
Do you think if I take
this to the police...

671
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,920
..do you think they won't be
able to tell who it belongs to?

672
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,160
They can do these things, Ed.

673
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,440
It isn't difficult.

674
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,600
OK.

675
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,880
Take it. Take it.

676
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,480
I don't want to do that.
Take it. I don't care.

677
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,640
I care, Ed.

678
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,400
I care because...

679
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,640
..this is a house of God
and you're lying to me.

680
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,680
EDGAR GROANS

681
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,400
Do you want to pray?  No.

682
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,440
Hm? I think you should.
I think you should pray.

683
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,040
EDGAR BREATHES SHAKILY

684
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,280
God was with you
in your darkest hour.

685
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,280
And now you lied in his house.

686
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,880
You need to pray. You know you do.

687
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,720
Look at me. Look at me.

688
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,440
If you can't confess your
sins to me, that's OK.

689
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,400
I don't matter. But, Ed...

690
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,000
..you HAVE to confess them to God.

691
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,840
That's the deal.

692
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,760
Yeah. OK.

693
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,800
If you've done wrong...

694
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,360
..that's OK.

695
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,640
We all do wrong.

696
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,400
But you have to lay yourself
open before God.

697
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,240
There's no forgiveness...

698
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,800
..without confessing
your sins first.

699
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,440
EDGAR MUMBLES

700
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,200
Out loud, Ed.

701
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,720
There's no-one here.

702
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,920
You're here.

703
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,040
As God's representative,
you know that.

704
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,560
And your friend.

705
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,360
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

706
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,880
..forgive me my sins...

707
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,160
Is that right?

708
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,480
Good. That's very good.

709
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,240
Very good. Keep going.

710
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,000
I-I've been...looking at things...

711
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,000
..things I shouldn't look at.

712
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,680
EDGAR SOBS

713
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,240
Go on.

714
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,960
I know I shouldn't.

715
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,200
I know it's wrong.

716
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,880
The vicar always tells me
what's wrong and right,

717
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,800
and I know it's wrong.

718
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,360
What's wrong, Ed?

719
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,520
Ed?

720
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,000
What's wrong with the
pictures on the flash drive?

721
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,000
Edgar.

722
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,640
Will my mum know?

723
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,200
Know what?

724
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,520
Will she...?

725
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,160
This is between you and God.

726
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,440
Oh, God, I-I-I don't...

727
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,560
You need to say it.

728
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,320
There's no forgiveness
unless you say it.

729
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,080
You're never forgiven!
You're never forgiven!

730
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,400
I know! I know!

731
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,960
You have to say it, Ed!

732
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,400
Nobody forgives you!

733
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,600
God forgives! Just say it.
It'll be fine.

734
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,920
It won't be fine!

735
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,320
It'll be fine if you say it!

736
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,040
I can't!

737
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,520
I can't!

738
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,160
Of course you can. It'll be fine.

739
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,800
I want to die! I want to die!

740
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,560
Why can't I just die?!

741
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,920
Why do they have to stop it?!

742
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,640
Why is it anyone's business?!

743
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,360
ORCHESTRAL MUSIC OVER DIALOGUE

744
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,080
Come here.

745
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,200
What are we doing?

746
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,240
Whatever stuff you've got on here -
I don't need to see it -

747
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,200
I want you to put it on my computer.

748
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,920
Why?  Make it look like
it's been hidden away.

749
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,640
Somewhere obscure.

750
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,400
Make it look like it's mine
and I'm hiding it.

751
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,560
You understand?

752
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,800
No.  You're off the hook.

753
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,240
It'll be my fault.

754
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,280
It'll be me.

755
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,200
But...why?

756
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,480
Oh, I don't know. Christ knows.

757
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,520
Because. Just do it.

758
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,560
Am I catching a train?

759
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,760
Go to any window on the right.

760
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,040
You should be able to see
a conference centre.

761
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,120
Back of it.

762
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,000
That's where Connor
disappeared from.

763
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,720
Yeah. And right behind it, the only
place he could have gone.

764
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,600
Allenville Station.

765
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,320
Well, that's not true.  Isn't it?
Have you got the footage there?

766
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,760
I've watched it over and over.
What am I missing?

767
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,280
Watch it again,
specifically the moment

768
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,880
when the camera pans
to the audience.

769
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,400
He was the only one wearing a tux.

770
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,120
How could a man wearing a tux,
carrying an award,

771
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,120
walk through the streets of
a city completely unnoticed?

772
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,240
Nobody saw him.

773
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,120
I'd say that's almost impossible.

774
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,960
Unless he walked across the
car park and came here?

775
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,440
Exactly.  Rubbish.

776
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,120
He'd have been noticed here, too.

777
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,520
He'd have stuck out just as
much here as in the street.

778
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,080
Turn the sound up.

779
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,240
Now go to when the doors open.

780
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,320
You guys.
ORCHESTRAL MUSIC

781
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,120
I'm the only one wearing a tux.
Can you hear it?  You got no respect.

782
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,840
Beethoven's 9th.

783
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,840
Oh, thank you, ladies.

784
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,760
Yeah, there's a concert
hall in there.  I checked.

785
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,720
What you just heard is four minutes
before the end of the symphony.

786
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,080
So...  It was nearly over,
is what I'm saying.

787
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,400
I get what you're saying.

788
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,760
Why are you saying it?

789
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,120
What am I even doing here?

790
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,400
Testing a theory.  What theory?

791
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,160
Watch.  I've watched
it over and over!

792
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,320
Not the video. The station.

793
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,400
MUSIC: Ode To Joy
by Beethoven

794
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,360
I've timed your arrival
with some care.

795
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,120
There's been a matinee today.

796
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,880
A concert has just finished
at the Allenville Centre.

797
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,040
I think the station should be
filling up right about now.

798
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,800
Am I right?  OK, so that's even more
people who could have seen him.

799
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,200
Exactly. Even in a crowd, how could

800
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,000
Connor Doyle have gone
completely unnoticed?

801
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,880
A man in a tux carrying an award?

802
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,560
OK, how?

803
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,120
You're forgetting something.

804
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,560
Forgetting what?

805
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,600
The orchestra.

806
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,240
MUSIC SWELLS

807
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,160
The orchestra has to get home, too.

808
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,000
You notice one man in a tux,

809
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,720
unless he is among
lots of men in tuxes.

810
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,880
That's the way we see the world -
we see the exception, not the rule.

811
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,800
So 15 minutes after the speech we
saw came the only moment when a man

812
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,320
in a tux could have waited in
that station completely unnoticed.

813
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,840
All we need to know is what trains
were leaving within the next five

814
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,320
to ten minutes of his arrival.

815
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,680
OK, so I'll check.

816
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,520
I already checked.

817
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,840
Of course you have.

818
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,160
What did you find?

819
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,920
What I was looking for.  Which was?

820
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,440
A coincidence.

821
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,600
OK.

822
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,800
We're here. Off you go.

823
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,520
We're here. Go.

824
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,920
I don't understand why you did it.

825
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,080
Er...

826
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,000
God, I can't think of anything else.

827
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,880
I really can't. Nothing else.
I just...

828
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,840
I just want to do the right thing.

829
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,880
Why is that so fucking difficult?

830
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,880
HE BREATHES DEEPLY

831
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,800
Fuck off. Go on, get inside.

832
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,560
Listen to me.

833
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,920
You never go anywhere
near that stuff again.

834
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,800
None of that...ever again!

835
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,520
You're ever tempted...

836
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,600
..you remember what I did for you,
what I did to myself for you,

837
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,440
then just stop.

838
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,280
You just stop.

839
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,320
I don't know why you're helping me.

840
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,240
Because I'm a fucking vicar.

841
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,240
Who's going to murder you?

842
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,800
Sorry? What?

843
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,360
Murder is one possible way
your life might end,

844
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,960
but who'd be the one to do it?

845
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,600
A stranger might kill you, but
unless you lead a violent lifestyle

846
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,640
yourself, that's highly unlikely.

847
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,480
Are you there yet?

848
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,840
Yes.

849
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,480
Go say hello.

850
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,800
Take the envelope.

851
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,320
The overwhelming likelihood
is that your murderer

852
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,520
is in your address book because
people tend to be murdered

853
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,040
by people they love.

854
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,720
Now, it could just be a coincidence,
but the first train that Connor

855
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,320
could have caught when he got
to the station was his train home.

856
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,840
Oh!

857
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,200
Hello again.

858
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,680
You OK?

859
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,720
No.

860
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,200
Within reason?

861
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,960
There's nothing reasonable
about this.

862
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,280
No, there really isn't.

863
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,840
I could cancel the Skype call.

864
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,560
Give you more time before
anyone notices I'm missing.

865
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,920
I've got no more tuition all week.

866
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,040
It'll be a while before
people look for me.

867
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,680
Why would you do that?

868
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,840
I don't want you making decisions
in a hurry or doing anything rash.

869
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,160
No-one's going to do anything rash.

870
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,000
You could just email
my sister from my account.

871
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,320
I could help you with
the wording if you like.

872
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,680
I'm on Webmail.

873
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,640
Tell you the password.

874
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,800
I don't need it.

875
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,920
It's "password".

876
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,480
The password is "password".

877
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,360
It's stupid, I know, but
who cares about my emails?

878
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,200
Janice, I really don't need it.

879
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,760
DOOR CLOSES

880
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,600
Well?

881
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,080
I'm tired. I just want to go to bed.
No.

882
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,480
Just tell me what happened
with Edgar.  It's OK. All fixed.

883
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,800
Ben's going to be fine.

884
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,480
What have you done?

885
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,600
I just need a moment.

886
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,760
No.

887
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,160
Tell me, what have you done?

888
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,600
You're going to be angry.

889
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,800
Tell me.

890
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,760
You going to show me
what's in that envelope?

891
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,880
You're holding it
like it's important.

892
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,040
Give her the envelope.

893
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,800
DOOR SLAMS

894
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,960
Hello?

895
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,920
Excuse me?

896
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,800
What's happening?

897
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,160
She looked at the photograph
and left.

898
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,360
Really?

899
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,040
That's interesting.

900
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,160
I thought she might just cry.

901
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,480
Where's she going?

902
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,160
Panic, probably. Running away.

903
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,480
People do.

904
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,000
Unless she's checking to see
if we dug up the body, too.

905
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,600
How did you get this?

906
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,280
Well, it seemed obvious that
having murdered her husband,

907
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,960
she probably buried the
award along with him.

908
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,720
How did you find it?

909
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,800
I didn't have to.

910
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,840
They get the same award every year.

911
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,080
Easy enough to find an image of it
and Photoshop some dirt on it.

912
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,600
He's very good, that Barney.

913
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,240
But she came to you for help.

914
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,160
Yeah, at the suggestion
of her daughter.

915
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,520
She still came.  Of course she did.

916
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,000
She even appealed on television
for her husband to come home.

917
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,880
Liars are always the loudest.

918
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,760
But you said she loved him.

919
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,880
I'm sure she did.

920
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,640
Murder is rarely an expression
of indifference.

921
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,160
Is that what you tell yourself?

922
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,880
I don't know what I tell myself,
but I can tell you this -

923
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,800
if you truly love someone,
never, ever come home early.

924
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,840
Am I supposed to be intrigued?

925
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,000
No. You're supposed
to get on a plane.

926
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,160
What?

927
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,680
S-sorry, wh-what plane?

928
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,320
You're going back to England.
I need someone on the ground there.

929
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,640
The message you gave me from
Barney was about Janice.

930
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,560
She's going to have a
Skype call at 9pm tomorrow

931
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,280
and I'm very interested
to know what happens.

932
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,760
But I thought you said...

933
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,200
Yeah, I need you to get on a plane.

934
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,880
You said you weren't taking
the case.

935
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,200
Of course I'm taking the case.
I just wanted to see

936
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,880
if you were willing to abandon your
friend to advance your career.

937
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,080
Why?  Why?

938
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,960
Because you seem to have a very
high opinion of your own ethics

939
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,160
and I thought it was time
you learned a lesson.

940
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,760
Thanks.  You're welcome.

941
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,320
Self-loathing is clarity
and clarity is useful.

942
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,480
Am I getting morality lessons
from a murderer?

943
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,720
HE CHUCKLES

944
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,400
Everyone's a murderer, Beth.

945
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,840
All it takes is a good reason
and a bad day.

946
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,280
Have a safe flight.

947
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,000
SHE SIGHS
Argh!

948
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,280
Shit!

949
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,240
I don't understand.
I am never going to understand.

950
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,600
You understand perfectly.

951
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,880
If Janice accuses Ben,
I'll take the blame.

952
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,680
I can back it up now,
I can prove it.

953
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,600
And Edgar? Bloody Edgar?

954
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,200
Edgar wouldn't survive this.

955
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,320
I will.

956
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,280
You have fucked this family.

957
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,080
I have saved this family.

958
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Ben won't be destroyed, you won't
kill a woman in our cellar.

959
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,120
You stupid arse.

960
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,960
I'm trying to do the right thing.
Edgar?

961
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,280
That's all I'm doing,
the right thing.

962
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,160
Ben's safe, you're safe,
Janice is safe.

963
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,240
Edgar?

964
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,360
Edgar's safe?

965
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,880
Yes, Ed's safe.

966
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,840
What's wrong with that?

967
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,160
What's wrong with any of that?

968
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,800
What is wrong with
keeping people safe?

969
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,520
I'm a vicar.
I'm supposed to do that.

970
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,560
You want people to think
you're a paedophile?

971
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,840
HE SCOFFS

972
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,520
No, of course I bloody don't!

973
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,200
But what else can I do?

974
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,520
We can delay it.

975
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,800
Delay what?

976
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,040
You need time to think about this.

977
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,320
She's got a Skype call tomorrow
at night and that's when people

978
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,960
start wondering where she is.

979
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,520
There's a chance that
I could get her to cancel it.

980
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,240
There's no point.

981
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,400
I'd have to persuade her.

982
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,320
We can cancel it if we want,
but there's no point, is there?

983
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,040
Sorry, what?

984
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,000
This is the only way out.

985
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,360
"We" can cancel it?

986
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,360
She gave me the password
to her email account.

987
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,920
She just gave you the password?

988
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,640
Doesn't matter. Forget about that.

989
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,840
What did you give her?

990
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,680
Nothing.  Nothing?
But I-I don't... That...

991
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,000
Mary, Mary, it's OK.

992
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,200
Eventually it'll be fine.

993
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,760
You'll see. I promise.

994
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,160
I know how it seems now...

995
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,840
..but we have to do this for Ben.

996
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,920
People are going to think
you're a paedophile.

997
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,800
Yeah, I know.

998
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,160
They're actually
going to believe that.

999
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,040
But so long as they believe it...

1000
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,520
..Ben is safe.

1001
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,720
# Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

1002
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,480
# Oh-oh, oh-oh

1003
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,160
# Oh-oh

1004
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,880
# Ohhh

1005
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,280
# You may run home for a long time

1006
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,520
# Run home for a long time

1007
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,440
# You may run home for a long time

1008
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,120
# I tell you, God Almighty's
going to cut you down

1009
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,320
# Great God Almighty's
going to cut you down. #
