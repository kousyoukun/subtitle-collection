1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:02,242
<i>Friends, we last left Jane and Rafael</i>

2
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:04,287
<i>dealing with an unexpected development.</i>

3
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:06,181
I believe Mateo does have ADHD.

4
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,078
How can we help him?

5
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:08,472
Well, there are treatment options

6
00:00:08,497 --> 00:00:10,589
that range from behavior
interventions to medication.

7
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:13,333
<i>But at least the two of them
were back in a good place.</i>

8
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,587
<i>Not in such a good place?
Our Petra.</i>

9
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:17,748
<i>See, she was going to propose to J.R.,</i>

10
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:20,806
<i>but then J.R. broke up with her
and moved to Houston.</i>

11
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:23,436
<i>But at least Petra had a
shoulder to ugly-cry on.</i>

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,308
I was gonna propose.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,879
<i>Also feeling vulnerable? Xiomara.</i>

14
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:30,477
<i>See, she was waiting to find
out if her chemotherapy worked.</i>

15
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:33,619
I'm not out of the woods yet,
until after the PET scan.

16
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:36,156
<i>And so, yeah,
everything was on pause for now,</i>

17
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:38,541
<i>including her sex life, unlike Alba,</i>

18
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:39,887
<i>who just got hitched!</i>

19
00:00:39,912 --> 00:00:41,163
<i>That's right.</i>

20
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:44,085
<i>Alba and Jorge went from
first base to a home run.</i>

21
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:45,786
<i>And speaking of home runs,</i>

22
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:47,935
<i>Rogelio had a brand-new TV show.</i>

23
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:51,277
What if our young lead's story
is in present day

24
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,340
and you and River
are living in the future?

25
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:54,359
On Mars!

26
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:58,104
We can call it
<i>This Is Mars.</i>

27
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:00,531
<i>I know, pretty out there, right?</i>

28
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,323
<i>But hey, it's a telenovela.</i>

29
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:04,979
<i>So let's blast off into ours.</i>

30
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:08,797
<i>When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was...</i>

31
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:11,230
<i>well, actually, for all of Jane's life,</i>

32
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:14,285
<i>there was no man of the
house, just three women.</i>

33
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:16,186
<i>And they didn't need a man,</i>

34
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:18,147
<i>because they took care of it all.</i>

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,382
Electricity went up.

36
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:20,918
Mom, remember not to leave

37
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:22,019
your curling iron plugged in all day.

38
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,752
My curling iron doesn't use
half as much electricity

39
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:27,335
as the fans your<i> abuela</i>
keeps running all day.

40
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:33,229
There, no more wobble.

41
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:34,791
Ooh, I like that nail polish.

42
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:37,024
Thanks. it's called Breakfast in Red.

43
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,427
I'll loan it to you.

44
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,474
<i>In fact, Jane had never heard</i>

45
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:45,862
<i>the term "man of the house"
used in real life until...</i>

46
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:52,795
Mm.

47
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:59,755
<i>Aww, looks like the man
and woman of the house</i>

48
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,743
<i>are in still in the honeymoon phase.</i>

49
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:03,533
So what's on the agenda today? Huh?

50
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:06,095
Besides being totally adorable.

51
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:13,219
Now that our arrangement
is permanent,

52
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:14,848
I'm taking my things out of storage.

53
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:16,009
Oh, great.

54
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,316
Not at all. I'll do it right now.

55
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,111
Anything for my new<i> step-abuelo.</i>

56
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:25,122
And maybe you could move some

57
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:26,873
of your bathroom things into your room.

58
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:29,000
All the hair stuff.

59
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:31,955
Of course.

61
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,298
Hey, uh,

62
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,402
how you feeling?

63
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,233
Itchy.

64
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:53,236
Your sheets are awful.
What thread count are they?

65
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,039
I don't know. They were on sale.

66
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:56,727
I'll have Temp send you
a set from the hotel.

67
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,863
They're Egyptian cotton.

68
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,270
I...

69
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:01,760
I meant how are you feeling about J.R.?

70
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,899
I had a good cry and now
I'm going to move forward.

71
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,283
It's okay to give yourself
some time to wallow.

72
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:08,144
No, I wallowed last night,
now I'm moving on.

73
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,457
Fresh start.

74
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,028
Ugh. I'm supposed to be
in a meeting right now,

75
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,505
but Temp didn't remind me.

76
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:16,097
You know what?

77
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:18,057
Today I'm about fresh starts all around.
She's fired.

78
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:20,751
Oh, no. Uh... Poor Temp.

79
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:22,529
When you reward
incompetence, we all lose.

80
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:25,635
Wait. Uh, I'll walk you out.

81
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,480
I have to get to
Rafael's to talk about...

82
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:29,690
Mateo! Five more minutes, okay?

83
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,829
So what do you think about
putting him on ADHD medication?

84
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,861
I really don't want to
go to that right away.

85
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:39,188
Because medication is
a lifelong decision,

86
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:40,599
and he is so young and I just,

87
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:42,127
- I don't feel comfortable...
- Jane.

88
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,453
I agree.

89
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:44,936
You do?

90
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:47,733
Yeah, 100%.
I'm obviously not anti-medication...

91
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:50,022
It's really helped a lot with my
depression...

92
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:52,968
but I'm an adult, and he's a kid,
so we should try other options first.

93
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:54,806
Exactly. So let's dive

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,641
- into behavior modification.
- Sounds good.

95
00:03:57,089 --> 00:04:00,051
Now hand over whatever ten-step list
I know you've already made.

96
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,054
Actually, it's 15, with subcategories.

97
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,381
I've been researching and...

98
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:06,571
<i>You know,
I'm the man of this telenovela,</i>

99
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:08,874
<i>and I say let's skip the boring stuff.</i>

100
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:12,076
<i>It all boils down to
three basic headlines...</i>

101
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,375
<i>In other words, "cut the crap"</i>

102
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:20,958
<i>Uh, sorry, I'm just picturing
Jane working out. Whew.</i>

103
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:22,030
<i>Okay.</i>

104
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:27,281
And the most important
thing to remember is

105
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:29,407
it's not about the days,
it's about the patterns.

106
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:31,103
That's our mantra.

107
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:32,519
Look at us, with a mantra.

108
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:33,644
A mantra. And...

109
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,589
- a notebook.
- Ah.

110
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,592
So we can keep a log
of Mateo's activities.

111
00:04:37,617 --> 00:04:39,987
We need everything to be
as consistent as possible

112
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:41,428
between our two places

113
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:43,431
so we can track Mateo's
patterns over time.

114
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:44,776
Per the mantra.

115
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:46,339
Remind me of the mantra again?

116
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:47,605
I'll write it in the notebook.

117
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:48,835
<i>You've got this.</i>

118
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:50,608
You're killing it, Dina.

119
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:51,870
Okay, bye.

120
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:55,869
Dina's been working like a
madwoman to finish the script

121
00:04:55,902 --> 00:04:57,871
for<i> This Is Mars.</i> She's almost done.

122
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,358
Wow, that was fast.

123
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,121
Yeah. She's turning it in
tonight, yes, she is.

124
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:08,603
The pilot is brilliant.
Between that and this,

125
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:10,850
the network has to
give us a pilot order.

126
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:12,779
That's great, hon.

127
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:15,301
Hopefully, we'll both be
getting good news soon.

128
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,263
The doctor scheduled my final PET scan.

129
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:20,724
In three weeks,
we'll find out if the chemo worked.

130
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:23,246
Really?

131
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:25,192
How are you feeling?

132
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,087
I'm nervous,

133
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:29,945
but I'm trying to stay positive.

134
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,573
I keep picturing all of the
things I'll be able to do

135
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,158
once I know the cancer's gone.

136
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,923
Get back to work, dance again.

137
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:42,050
And maybe even get our sex life
back on track before we turn 50.

138
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:45,704
Well, no matter what happens,

139
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,273
we're in this together,
and that's the key.

140
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,635
Ah! Abuela!

141
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:52,746
Hmm?

142
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:54,262
What happened to the table by the door?

143
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:00,625
Don't. I-I want it.

144
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,201
Jane, door!

145
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:25,406
<i>Yeah, so there's been</i>

146
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:28,102
<i>quite a bit of re-Jorganizing in here.</i>

147
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:33,492
I've got it, don't worry.

148
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,472
Petra? What's wrong?

149
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,059
Oh, I was cleaning the penthouse

150
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:44,594
because my idiot temp messed
up the maid schedule again.

151
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:46,405
Maybe it's time to cut her loose.

152
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:47,963
Him.

153
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,749
<i>Oh, sorry, it's been three weeks.</i>

154
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:50,999
<i>Let me catch you up.</i>

155
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:53,222
<i>As you'll recall, Petra had this temp.</i>

156
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:57,323
<i>But then she had this one,
then this one and this one.</i>

157
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:59,023
<i>And...</i>

158
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:00,453
But that's not the point.

159
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:02,796
The point is when I was cleaning,

160
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:05,304
I found the engagement ring
I was going to give J.R.

161
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:07,571
and I know I shouldn't have looked at
it, but I did,

162
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:08,789
and now...

163
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:10,562
Aww.

164
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:16,052
How long is this going to last?

165
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:17,922
I'm so sick of crying.

166
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:20,260
I feel like a Villanueva.

167
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:23,321
I know, I know, but,

168
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:25,557
uh, it's like I told you
on the phone last night...

169
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,099
<i>And the past 20 nights.</i>

170
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:28,926
grieving is a process.

171
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:31,309
Maybe it's time to take the
next step in the process.

172
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:32,479
<i>Showering?</i>

173
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,202
Returning the engagement ring.

174
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:35,412
Will you come with me?

175
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,124
Of course. But tomorrow,

176
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,890
'cause we're about to have dinner.

177
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:41,318
Did Alba make arepas?

178
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:43,694
Yeah. Do you want to...

179
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,957
Yeah, thanks.

180
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,077
Geez, who died?

181
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,129
Uh, actually, my mom's getting
her final PET scan tomorrow,

182
00:07:58,154 --> 00:07:59,754
to see if her cancer treatment worked.

183
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:01,904
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

184
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:02,994
- I'll go.
- It's okay.

185
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:04,204
Please stay.

186
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,328
You're just in time

187
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:06,474
to pray with us.

188
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,298
I will do it in English.

189
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:15,125
We ask you, Heavenly Father,

190
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:16,938
to guide Xiomara,

191
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:18,646
as you already have,

192
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:21,480
through her journey with cancer.

193
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:26,031
We pray that the treatments
have done their work,

194
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:29,292
that her suffering is at an end.

195
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:34,401
We pray that her life from now on

196
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,010
be blessed

197
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:39,408
and full of joy and good health.

198
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:43,347
In the name of the Father and the Son

199
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:46,312
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

200
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:47,345
Amen.

201
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:48,266
<i>Amen.</i>

202
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:56,894
<i>You'll recall, we last left Jane</i>

203
00:08:56,943 --> 00:08:58,545
<i>praying for her mother.</i>

204
00:08:58,578 --> 00:08:59,913
Her PET scan's later today.

205
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,980
Waiting is the hardest part.

206
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:06,194
Do you want to distract yourself
with some reading material?

207
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:08,235
It is a real page-turner.

208
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,343
Ooh.

209
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:11,346
I especially love the
part about the color

210
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,624
of the sunrise when you ran
Mateo to school last week.

211
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,970
Okay, maybe my entries
are a little too detailed,

212
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:18,663
but at least you can read

213
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:20,066
my handwriting. I...

214
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:22,330
I am sorry, but what is a "meldooper"?

215
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:23,732
Meltdown.

216
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,272
Oh. Oh, no, what happened?

217
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,562
He lost it at Ethan's birthday party.

218
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,221
It was hard to sell him on
a nitrate-free Fruit Roll-Up

219
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:32,881
when all the other kids got cake.

220
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,173
How bad?

221
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,501
"We owe Ethan's mom a new lamp" bad.

222
00:09:37,094 --> 00:09:38,494
It's not about the days...

223
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:39,896
It's about the pattern. I know.

224
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,206
It's just a small setback.

225
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:43,840
Should we talk about it over dinner?

226
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:45,747
Oh, I, uh, can't tonight.

227
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:47,545
What, you got a hot date?

228
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,727
I mean, not a<i> hot</i> date.

229
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,445
Just a regular one?

230
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,909
<i>Careful. Don't have a meldooper, Jane.</i>

231
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:59,031
Oh. Okay. Hope it goes well.

232
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:05,301
Slow down, Mateo,
you know we don't run in the house.

233
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,863
<i>It's important to note</i>

234
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:09,320
<i>that Jane wanted to talk
to her</i> abuela<i> about Rafael,</i>

235
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,261
<i>but unfortunately,
she had bigger fish to fry.</i>

236
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:15,672
Do you?

237
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:16,647
Hmm...

238
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,248
Mm-hmm.

239
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,467
If he can catch a giant fish,
I think he can probably

240
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:44,207
make his own tuna sandwich.

241
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,865
I know. I'm... I just mean,

242
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,059
you're a strong, independent woman.

243
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,926
You don't have to let him
hang something on the wall

244
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:57,990
if you don't like it.

245
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:04,610
And yours.

246
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:12,301
Yeah, Jane.<i> Ours.</i>

247
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,948
<i>It's like they're
living in the '50s.</i>

248
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:17,943
He might as well have said,
"Woman, go make me a sandwich!"

249
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:19,880
- Woman, go easy on him.
- Ah...

250
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:22,376
I'm just worried this
will become a pattern.

251
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:24,370
He's<i> her</i> husband, not yours.

252
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:26,741
And I know you don't excel
at minding your own business,

253
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,948
but you should stay
out of their marriage.

254
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:31,962
You've got this.

255
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:34,261
Yeah! Mm-hmm.

256
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,165
<i>And speaking of marriage...</i>

257
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,266
How did the proposal go?

258
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,496
Would I be standing here
with a ring if it went well?

259
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:43,724
That was a rhetorical question.

260
00:11:43,757 --> 00:11:44,892
She just wants her money back.

261
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:46,200
Right away.

262
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,953
Wow. Just
handing over that ring

263
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:53,877
makes me feel like a
weight has been lifted.

264
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,206
<i>Well,
it was a three-carat diamond.</i>

265
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,337
You were right.

266
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:59,564
Ooh, it feels good to get
rid of that reminder of J.R.

267
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:02,453
<i>That's one
small step for Petra...</i>

268
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:06,431
<i>and one giant leap for
Rogelio de la Vega.</i>

269
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:08,592
<i>That's right. Dina really was on a roll.</i>

270
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:12,135
<i>And</i> This is Mars<i> got a pilot
order from the network!</i>

271
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:14,070
How does that space suit feel?

272
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:15,877
Sleek, supple and slimming.

273
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,896
I can't wait to get in front
of the cameras tomorrow.

274
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:22,273
Rogelio, thank you for the
beautiful Martian bouquet.

275
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:23,453
Of course.

276
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:32,468
<i>Uh-oh.
That's gonna be a problem.</i>

277
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:33,928
They're not gonna be a problem.

278
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,788
<i>Oh, ignore me!</i>

279
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:37,779
We're so much more talented than them.

280
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,001
And you're so sexy.

281
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:40,670
And you're so gorgeous.

282
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:42,549
And our skin glows like the sun.

283
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,926
And theirs will only get worse.

284
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:48,219
<i>Looks like
they have a mantra, too.</i>

285
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:53,497
And so will your skin if
you keep frowning like that.

286
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,956
Do you know how much Botox

287
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:57,445
it takes to get rid of worry wrinkles?

288
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,216
Approximately eight to 20 units.

289
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:00,698
Exactly.

290
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:03,001
Forget them.

291
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:05,439
No, I was just thinking about Xiomara.

292
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,564
She had her PET scan this
morning, so now we're waiting.

293
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:22,424
It's just a telemarketer.

294
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:26,172
Look, I appreciate the support,

295
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,840
but you guys should really go home.

296
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:29,842
The doctor probably
won't even call today.

297
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,896
Yeah.

298
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,621
I thought I was headed in the
right direction, you know?

299
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,692
Getting used to us as friends.

300
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:47,710
But this feels like a real setback.

301
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:55,702
<i>Yeah, remember,
Jane, you're gorgeous,</i>

302
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,169
<i>your skin looks amazing, and...</i>

303
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,647
<i>Oh, sorry. Wrong mantra.</i>

304
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,367
<i>"It's not about the days,</i>

305
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:02,876
<i>it's about the pattern."</i>

306
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:09,042
It's the doctor's office.

307
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:11,037
We're right here with you, Mom.

308
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:14,390
Thank you.

309
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:16,090
But can I have one of my hands back

310
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:17,368
- so I can answer?
- Oh!

311
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:23,997
Hello?

312
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,235
Yes, this is Xiomara.

313
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:29,904
Okay.

314
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:33,393
Okay.

315
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:37,058
Thank you. Bye.

316
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:42,530
I'm cancer-free.

317
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:44,825
Oh, yes!

318
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,990
Oh, I have to call your father.

319
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:52,492
Oh, thank God. I'm so happy.

320
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:54,543
I can't wait to see you
tonight and celebrate.

321
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,770
Okay. You too.

322
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:02,241
Xo's PET scan results came
back, and she is cancer-free!

323
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:04,413
Finally...

324
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:06,254
we can be together!

325
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:09,550
<i>Mars, we have a problem.</i>

326
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:16,165
Ms. Fields? They'd like to see you

327
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,175
for one more zero-gravity hair test.

328
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:39,980
To not having cancer.

329
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:42,426
To not having cancer.

330
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,518
I've been saying it
over and over all day,

331
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:50,212
but it's hard to believe it, you know?

332
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:52,347
It's hard to just click back to normal.

333
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,999
Give yourself time. It'll happen.

334
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:56,894
Agreed.

335
00:15:58,179 --> 00:15:59,768
And maybe this will help.

336
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,937
Should we dance, Mr. De La Vega?

337
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:11,603
I would love to dance,
Mrs. De la Vega.

338
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,408
I'm so happy.

339
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:19,421
Me, too.

340
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:21,243
So happy.

341
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:25,817
I also have a piece of-of teeny, tiny,

342
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:30,070
totally unimportant, not-so-happy news.

343
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:32,563
News that won't even matter in light

344
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:34,723
of how great<i> your</i> news is.

345
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:36,635
What are you talking about?

346
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,129
River kissed me.

347
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,196
What?

348
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,707
Obviously, it wasn't reciprocated.

349
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,160
Because I'm happily, ecstatically

350
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,968
married to the most amazing
woman on the planet.

351
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:51,729
So I'm sure that after
your clear PET scan,

352
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,213
this little incident

353
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:55,189
will roll right off your back.

354
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:58,976
Oh, hell no!

355
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,532
I cannot believe that conniving
bitch made a pass at you!

356
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,068
What was she thinking?

357
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:05,469
Apparently she thought that our

358
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:07,637
love-hate relationship was mostly love.

359
00:17:07,662 --> 00:17:09,198
Have you been flirting with her?

360
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,399
No! Of course not!

361
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,699
I've only been nice to her.

362
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:13,833
How nice?

363
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:16,389
People fall in love with
me all the time, Xiomara.

364
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,760
I usually see it coming.

365
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:21,000
But don't worry. I will clear it all up.

366
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,375
I just have to handle this delicately.

367
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,410
Because I don't want to jeopardize

368
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:25,610
our working relationship.

369
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,574
You better set her straight.

370
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:29,881
I promise. I will.

371
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,950
Still want to dance?

372
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,020
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

373
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,520
Another amazing meal.

374
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,623
Even when your<i> abuela's</i> at work!
I don't know

375
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,959
how she does it.
She cooks, she cleans...

376
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:42,327
She is the perfect woman.

377
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,432
<i>Hmm.
I'm not sure their criteria</i>

378
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:45,607
<i>for that is the same...</i>

379
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:49,789
Ooh.

380
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,002
Oh... Oh, uh, Mateo?

381
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,816
Take your plate to the sink.
Remember, we have

382
00:17:57,848 --> 00:17:59,709
a dinner routine: set the table,

383
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:00,815
eat, clear the table.

384
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:02,678
Jorge didn't have to clear<i> his</i> plate.

385
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:05,072
Why should<i> I</i> have to?
I'm the man of the house, too.

386
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:07,264
<i>Oof. This is not the pattern</i>

387
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:08,785
<i>Jane was trying to reinforce.</i>

388
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:10,460
You might be a man,

389
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:13,642
but gender roles have evolved,
and boys and girls

390
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,901
do the same things now.

391
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:17,304
And frankly, "man of the house"

392
00:18:17,336 --> 00:18:19,447
is not a term people even use anymore.

393
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:22,110
I don't care,
I just want to watch soccer.

394
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,337
Oh, uh...

395
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,268
Sorry, Mateo.
No screen time on weeknights.

396
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,414
Grab your dish and
we'll go pick out a book.

397
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,176
No!

398
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:32,021
This is not up for discussion.
Reading time.

399
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:33,571
- I don't want to read! I hate reading!
- Now.

400
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:34,764
Mateo...

401
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,256
No! No-no-no-no-no...

402
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:41,623
Do you have a minute?

403
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,865
Oh. You want to join me?

404
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,932
Um, no. But thank you.

405
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,301
Is my grandma here?

406
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,623
Grocery shopping.

407
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,938
That woman never gets tired.

408
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:52,973
Glad Mateo's calmed down.

409
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:54,807
Last night was a doozy.

410
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,515
Actually, um, maybe we can
talk for a minute about that.

411
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:02,697
So, I know living together
has been an adjustment.

412
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:04,937
For everyone. But since we are

413
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:07,766
living under the same roof,
there are a few things

414
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,887
that you could do that
would really help me out

415
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:10,911
with Mateo.

416
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:12,630
Oh, okay. Sure.

417
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,988
Well, for example, the television.

418
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:16,798
Uh, with Mateo's ADHD,

419
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,826
we're really trying to establish
patterns and healthy routines,

420
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:22,893
and it is hard for Mateo
to focus when the TV is on.

421
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,149
So, if you could maybe wait

422
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:27,165
until Mateo's asleep to watch TV?

423
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:28,708
Uh, just on the nights

424
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,194
when he's sleeping over, of course.

425
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:31,496
Okay.

426
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,740
And also, it would be really great

427
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,175
if, when Mateo's around,

428
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,911
you could pick up your dishes?

429
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,678
Just to help us reinforce

430
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:40,913
good behavioral routines.

431
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:42,648
Ah. Gotcha.

432
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,317
And obviously, if there's anything

433
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,684
I can help you with, I'm all ears.

434
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:47,427
Sounds good.

435
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:49,621
Thank you, Jorge!

436
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:50,656
I really appreciate that.

437
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,859
Uh... now I have to run.

438
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:54,497
<i>Literally.</i>

439
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:56,094
<i>In case you forgot...</i>

440
00:19:57,558 --> 00:19:58,826
You're doing great, Mr. Sweetface!

441
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,543
<i>More like Mr. Sweaty-face!</i>

442
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:05,026
Ah! Come on, Mateo.

443
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:07,143
Only five more blocks. Huh?

444
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:08,910
And you'll be able to focus
so much better at school

445
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:10,282
if you get some of the energy out now.

446
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:13,152
I'm not going! I'm tired.

447
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:14,834
You've got this!

448
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:18,148
I hate running,
and you're the worst mommy ever!

449
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,283
You're gonna be late for school, Mateo.

450
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:20,897
So? I hate school, too!

451
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:22,790
I'm staying right here!

452
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,234
Would you move for a candy bar?

453
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:29,008
<i>Technically, a gluten-free,
preservative-free protein bar.</i>

454
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:31,696
You can have the whole
thing if you finish our run.

455
00:20:34,753 --> 00:20:35,889
What do you say, Mateo?

456
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,648
Huh? Huh? Okay!

457
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:57,677
What? Nothing.

458
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:02,783
I just asked him to put his dishes away,

459
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,445
I can't believe he tattled on me.

460
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,976
I'm disrespectful?

461
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,215
I think the way he treats
you is disrespectful.

462
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,931
He's making you wait
on him hand and foot.

463
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:16,196
You're married, not indentured.

464
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:21,860
Abuela, don't you think
that's a little old-fashioned?

465
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:26,245
I'm just worried that you're
losing who you are, Abuela.

466
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,280
Establishing bad patterns
for your relationship.

467
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:56,372
<i>Damn.</i>

468
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:57,799
<i>Jane got owned.</i>

469
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:06,446
Yes, of course.

470
00:22:14,696 --> 00:22:17,232
I would also like an apology.

471
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:24,270
<i>And so Jane apologized to Jorge.</i>

472
00:22:24,465 --> 00:22:25,867
<i>Even though what she
wanted to do was hit him</i>

473
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,904
<i>upside his head with his big, dumb fish.</i>

474
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,605
And I know I overstepped...

475
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,355
and offended you.

476
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,649
I didn't mean any
disrespect and I'm so sorry.

477
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,418
Thank you, Jane.

478
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:38,577
And since we're talking about respect,

479
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:41,327
there are a few other
things we should discuss.

480
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:44,592
I-I notice you often park

481
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:46,699
by the footpath in front of the house.

482
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:49,355
I would appreciate it if you
leave that space for Alba,

483
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:51,158
so she doesn't have to walk as far

484
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,424
when she gets home from work.

485
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,253
- Got it, will do.
- Also...

486
00:22:54,492 --> 00:22:56,027
- Hmm?
- it would be great

487
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:58,683
If you could be a little quicker
in the bathroom in the mornings.

488
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:01,193
Quicker in the bathroom, check.

489
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:02,840
And, also...

490
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:05,648
when you come home later than 9:00,

491
00:23:05,673 --> 00:23:07,886
please try to keep it down.

492
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:10,121
We're both light sleepers.

493
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:12,496
No problem.

494
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:14,458
Is that it?

495
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:15,451
That's it.

496
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,763
Great. See you at home.

497
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:20,438
<i>I hate this.</i>

498
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:22,871
I hate everything about this.

499
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:23,976
Start over.

500
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,042
Hey, what's going on?

501
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:27,570
I'm redecorating the hotel and
looking at some terrible ideas.

502
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,506
But didn't you just redo it?

503
00:23:29,738 --> 00:23:32,374
That was two years ago, Jane.
That's like a lifetime

504
00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:33,675
in hotel years. Look,

505
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:34,790
I know what I'm doing, okay?

506
00:23:35,272 --> 00:23:36,600
Okay, yeah. Great.

507
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:43,356
Yo, Mrs. S.

508
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:45,626
Here are those blueprints you asked for.

509
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:47,287
The task was to get
them signed by Milos.

510
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,621
Are these signed?

511
00:23:48,646 --> 00:23:49,797
Nah, brah; couldn't make it

512
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,895
to the prison in time.
Traffic was gnarly.

513
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:53,994
I told you Tuesdays were
the only day Milos could get

514
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,923
visitors, now I have to wait
a week to get his signature.

515
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:57,864
You have to start planning
ahead and if you can't

516
00:23:57,896 --> 00:23:59,850
do that,
maybe this isn't the job for you.

517
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,268
Yeah. I don't think it is.

518
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,299
Great. You're fired.

519
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,453
Sweet. Fun employment!

520
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,427
<i>Who does she miss? J.R.?</i>

521
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,732
Hi, Mrs. Solano.

522
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:19,733
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

523
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:21,333
<i>You remember Krishna.</i>

524
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:29,776
Hey, you.

525
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,338
How's life after prison?

526
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,228
- Uh, did you get my fruit basket?
- No.

527
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:36,449
Oh. O-One of my temps
was supposed to send you one.

528
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:38,319
Uh, which is exactly why I'm calling.

529
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,522
Look.
I feel so guilty about everything

530
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:42,955
that happened and, and I...

531
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:45,112
I miss us.

532
00:24:46,078 --> 00:24:47,218
So what do you say?

533
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:49,347
Want to come back to work?
Get the gang back together?

534
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:51,848
Hard pass, Mrs. Solano.

535
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:53,646
<i>Did you talk to River yet?</i>

536
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:55,974
No, she's still in wardrobe
but as soon as she's out,

537
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,129
I'll straighten her out.

538
00:24:57,593 --> 00:24:59,728
This set needs to be a place of honor,

539
00:24:59,777 --> 00:25:02,147
respect and dignity.

540
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:07,709
Because I'm half-human, half-Martian.

541
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:09,036
I've started to evolve.

542
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:10,252
Didn't you read the script?

543
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,410
Hello.

544
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:12,603
Hello.

545
00:25:16,157 --> 00:25:17,703
I'm calm.

546
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:19,282
But he better set her straight.

547
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:21,360
And I'm listening in.

548
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,952
Oh. Your wife is here.

549
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:27,346
Yes, and I've told her what happened.

550
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:29,295
And I'm flattered.

551
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,270
That someone
as spectacularly beautiful

552
00:25:32,351 --> 00:25:34,569
as the incomparable River Fields

553
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:37,549
would be interested in me.

554
00:25:37,657 --> 00:25:38,745
But alas,

555
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:40,555
I must make clear

556
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:43,317
I'm very happily married.

557
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:46,772
And I'm sorry if I misled you
in any way.

558
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:49,690
Let's just keep this
relationship professional.

559
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,220
I completely agree.

560
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:55,781
This show is too important

561
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,555
to both of us to jeopardize it.

562
00:25:58,616 --> 00:26:00,267
I apologize for overstepping.

563
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:02,046
It won't happen again.

564
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,221
Professional it is.

565
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,265
All right.

566
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:05,838
Time for you two to have sex.

567
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:10,453
<i>Should I be worried about this?</i>

568
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:12,793
Petra?

569
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,542
Worried about my personal living space?

570
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:17,172
Which is none of your business?

571
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:18,799
You are my business.

572
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:20,934
And I knew you were doing
some work in the lobby,

573
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,835
but I didn't realize it
was a whole hotel remodel.

574
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:24,137
It's gonna be expensive.

575
00:26:24,645 --> 00:26:26,348
You want to maybe talk it through?

576
00:26:27,738 --> 00:26:29,479
The girls are waiting
for you in their room.

577
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:31,578
I am just worried that you're
getting in over your head.

578
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,851
Permits alone are gonna
be a huge expense.

579
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:36,549
Would that be worth it
for maybe 10% growth?

580
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:38,365
I know it's a big investment, Rafael.

581
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,244
I don't need you to mansplain
hotel finance to me.

582
00:26:40,886 --> 00:26:42,574
<i>And from mansplaining...</i>

583
00:26:43,096 --> 00:26:44,771
<i>to Marsplaining.</i>

584
00:26:44,796 --> 00:26:46,895
Our scientists have
finally figured out

585
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,199
how to support all forms of life
in the Martian atmosphere.

586
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,657
The first Martian
flower was just the beginning.

587
00:26:53,123 --> 00:26:56,042
In our man-made lake,
we have the first Martian shark.

588
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:58,504
And I've saved the best news for last.

589
00:26:58,537 --> 00:27:00,740
We will name it Lake Brenda.

590
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:03,371
After the first co-president of Mars.

591
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:06,447
I think we should properly christen

592
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,676
this lake by making love in it.

593
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:25,132
Cut.

594
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:26,611
Hmm!

595
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:28,676
<i>That's definitely
not in the script.</i>

596
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:31,394
Get your hands off my man,

597
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:32,967
you horny Martian bitch!

598
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:36,407
Cut!

599
00:27:37,817 --> 00:27:40,594
Somebody stop them. Stop, stop!

600
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:43,304
No! Stop.

601
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:44,488
Somebody stop them.

602
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:45,640
No, Xiomara.

603
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:46,673
No!

604
00:27:46,846 --> 00:27:47,846
<i>Watch out, Xo.</i>

605
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,549
<i>Jump over that shark.</i>

606
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:51,283
Stop! Stop, stop.

607
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,620
Xiomara, stop. Please stop.
No, no, no, no.

608
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:56,864
What were you thinking?

609
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:57,991
Why don't you ask that

610
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,693
woman who was groping you?

611
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:01,460
It's called acting!

612
00:28:01,494 --> 00:28:02,896
Yeah, right. They called "cut."

613
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:04,132
I didn't hear it.

614
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:05,940
Maybe that's because
you were too busy trying

615
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:07,858
to get a piece of
tail, you home wrecker.

616
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:08,728
Okay. Come here.

617
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,688
Come here, come here. Come on, let's go.

618
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,141
Xiomara, this is my place of work.

619
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,057
Exactly.

620
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:17,959
So why is your costar dry humping you

621
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:19,094
in front of everyone?

622
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:20,651
We have a lot of
material to shoot today.

623
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:22,088
- We'll talk later.
- Excuse me?

624
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:24,313
Why don't you go cool
off in my dressing room?

625
00:28:25,552 --> 00:28:28,022
<i>Inhala, exhala.</i>

626
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:32,931
Uh, Mateo.

627
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:34,229
This is important.

628
00:28:34,294 --> 00:28:35,293
These breathing exercises

629
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:36,828
will make it easier for
you to pay attention

630
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:38,162
to your school work,
but you need to focus.

631
00:28:38,187 --> 00:28:40,344
I can't.
I'm too bored.

632
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,449
Sounds like you need to
burn off a little energy.

633
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:45,278
What do you say we run
around the block a few times

634
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:47,811
- while Daddy finishes cooking?
- I'm sick of running

635
00:28:47,836 --> 00:28:49,824
And I don't want Daddy's gross food.

636
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:52,698
If you finish your
exercises and eat dinner,

637
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:54,620
you can have a chocolate bar.
How's that?

638
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,561
I don't want a disgusting
fake candy bar.

639
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:58,769
<i>Uh-oh, looks like
he's having another "meldooper."</i>

640
00:28:58,794 --> 00:29:00,168
I never get real dessert.

641
00:29:00,193 --> 00:29:02,028
- Or even chicken nuggets...
- Try to calm down.

642
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,291
- or anything good.
- Please, Mateo.

643
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:05,047
If you make me run to school again,

644
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:06,327
- I'm running away from home!
- Just take a deep breath.

645
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:08,001
No, I don't want to do this anymore.

646
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:09,381
Well, neither do I.

647
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:12,564
I need a time out.

648
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:15,270
You know what?
I think we all need a break.

649
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:17,839
Here, play with this.

650
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,985
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

651
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:21,800
I need some air.

652
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,789
He's right.

653
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,043
I can't do this.

654
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:36,347
I can't run with him to school anymore.

655
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,382
I'm exhausted and we're always late.

656
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:41,061
Then there's the logs, his diet;

657
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:42,400
I just feel like I'm always

658
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:44,186
studying him and disciplining him.

659
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,654
So let's stop.

660
00:29:45,686 --> 00:29:47,155
- We can't.
- Why not?

661
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:50,316
Because we have to help
him however we can.

662
00:29:50,341 --> 00:29:51,347
Yeah, agreed.

663
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,971
However we can.

664
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,712
And we can't evaluate

665
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:57,450
If the behavior therapy
is actually working

666
00:29:57,475 --> 00:29:59,813
unless it's something that
we can sustain long term.

667
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:01,487
And we can't sustain this.

668
00:30:01,956 --> 00:30:03,609
I just want to do everything possible.

669
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:04,909
Don't we owe him that?

670
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,545
We are.

671
00:30:06,578 --> 00:30:07,801
And we will.

672
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:10,677
But we also have to enjoy our son.

673
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:12,183
And live our lives.

674
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:17,789
Let's just relax the food rules

675
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:19,044
on the weekends.

676
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:21,394
Let him have cake at birthday parties.

677
00:30:22,774 --> 00:30:23,929
Yeah.

678
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:25,475
Okay.

679
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:27,898
- No more running to school.
- Oh, thank God.

680
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:30,184
Mm. Let's throw out
that stupid notebook.

681
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:32,187
I love the notebook.

682
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:34,406
Can't we just keep the notebook?

683
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:42,427
This is nice out here.

684
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,007
Yeah, I needed this.

685
00:30:47,114 --> 00:30:49,060
So? How'd your date go?

686
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:53,444
Not bad.

687
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:54,559
Cool.

688
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:56,436
What does "not bad" mean?

689
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:58,749
- That I don't want to get into it.
- Gotcha. Understood.

690
00:30:59,454 --> 00:31:02,320
I will tell you if there's
something worth telling.

691
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:04,107
Perfect.

692
00:31:05,704 --> 00:31:06,871
<i>Aw.</i>

693
00:31:06,905 --> 00:31:09,170
<i>Look at them. So mature.</i>

694
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:11,497
<i>Less mature...</i>

695
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:13,091
I'm sorry for my outburst.

696
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:16,293
But River Fields is after you.

697
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:18,042
You have to believe me.

698
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:20,036
Xiomara, she just got
caught up with the scene.

699
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:21,466
Please, let this go.

700
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:25,535
Can we talk?

701
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,406
I want to apologize.

702
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:33,199
I honestly did not hear

703
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,493
the director call "cut."

704
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:36,629
But beyond that,

705
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,913
I should never have kissed your husband.

706
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,520
And even though what I did
is totally unforgivable,

707
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,184
I still wanted to apologize to you.

708
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:48,221
Sometimes I get caught up

709
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,279
in the fantasy.

710
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,924
I lose myself in the role

711
00:31:53,508 --> 00:31:54,891
and... as pathetic

712
00:31:54,925 --> 00:31:57,581
as it sounds,
I start to believe what I'm feeling.

713
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:01,355
It's a combination of... being method

714
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:02,869
and... and, well,

715
00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:05,800
being a little lonely,

716
00:32:05,912 --> 00:32:08,629
if I'm... if I'm being honest.

717
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,759
But it's no excuse.

718
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,663
And nothing like that
will ever happen again.

719
00:32:13,695 --> 00:32:14,705
You have my word.

720
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:17,806
Okay, then thank you for saying that.

721
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:22,174
I'll-I'll get out of your hair.

722
00:32:22,585 --> 00:32:24,421
- I'll see you at home?
- Yes.

723
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,999
Thank you for doing that.

724
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,473
No problem.

725
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,685
Oh!

726
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:39,118
You slapped me?

727
00:32:39,143 --> 00:32:40,211
Uh!

728
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:41,647
Well, you kissed me!

729
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,627
Because your wife
bought our cover story.

730
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:44,787
Our what?

731
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,814
There is no cover story.

732
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,309
Let me make this perfectly clear.

733
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,776
I love my wife.

734
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,278
I don't want to have sex with you,

735
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,179
I have never wanted
to have sex with you,

736
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:54,714
and if you keep trying
to have sex with me,

737
00:32:54,747 --> 00:32:55,882
I'm going to HR,

738
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:57,283
and if they don't pay attention,

739
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:59,333
I'll go to Alyssa Milano.

740
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,121
Jorge...

741
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:16,769
Hey. I need a place to stay.

742
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:19,008
Yeah, sure. Come in.
I just need to make a call.

743
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:21,142
My last temp screwed up my injunction,

744
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:22,909
and now Milos is blocking
the hotel renovation.

745
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:25,746
Well, maybe that's for the best.

746
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,580
It'll give you time to think
about whether you really

747
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,097
want to go ahead with it.

748
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:32,308
Rafael talked to you.

749
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:34,155
He may have mentioned it,

750
00:33:34,187 --> 00:33:35,773
but that's not the point. I...

751
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,683
I'm worried that this renovation

752
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,111
is just one big,
old distraction from J.R.

753
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,511
Yeah, of course it is.

754
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:43,035
Everywhere I look,
I see reminders of her.

755
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,095
I can't take it.

756
00:33:44,452 --> 00:33:45,659
So you're gonna...

757
00:33:45,684 --> 00:33:47,853
- redecorate her out of your memory?
- Exactly.

758
00:33:47,886 --> 00:33:49,671
As soon as I get that injunction.

759
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,462
Judge Judy stayed here last
month with her grand kids.

760
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,652
I'll give her a call.

761
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:53,987
Eh... It's 11:00 on a weeknight.

762
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:55,748
You cannot call Judge Judy right now.

763
00:33:55,815 --> 00:33:57,173
Of course I can! Give it to me.

764
00:33:57,198 --> 00:33:58,842
Not a chance. I am your friend,

765
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,844
and I am not giving this
phone back until you agree

766
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:02,179
to stop bankrupting yourself

767
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:03,415
to erase J.R.

768
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,293
It's not just about erasing her.

769
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:12,093
I want her back.

770
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:13,657
But I can't have her.

771
00:34:13,682 --> 00:34:16,065
And I feel totally out
of control and powerless,

772
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,773
and I don't know what to do with myself

773
00:34:17,798 --> 00:34:19,836
and I have to do something
or I'm going to explode.

774
00:34:21,196 --> 00:34:22,477
Get your sneakers.

775
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:24,654
<i>Why are we doing this again?</i>

776
00:34:24,915 --> 00:34:27,076
When your emotions and
energy levels are too high,

777
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:28,579
heavy exercise can help.

778
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:29,629
It's not.

779
00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:30,670
Yeah. Keep running.

780
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:32,616
I don't know if you've ever
been heartbroken before.

781
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:33,616
Have you?

782
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,017
Not like this.

783
00:34:35,246 --> 00:34:36,781
Not even close. I blame you.

784
00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:38,351
Of course you do.

785
00:34:38,384 --> 00:34:39,552
For what, exactly?

786
00:34:39,585 --> 00:34:40,820
Well, I never believed in

787
00:34:40,853 --> 00:34:42,755
this sappy destiny stuff before.

788
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,112
And for a while there, because of you,

789
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:47,490
I actually thought J.R. was my...

790
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:48,761
happily ever after.

791
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:50,519
Well, if it helps,

792
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:51,931
I'm over that now.

793
00:34:52,421 --> 00:34:54,821
I thought Rafael and I would make it,

794
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:56,450
but I might change the end of my book

795
00:34:56,475 --> 00:34:58,645
so the heroine ends up
living with her<i> abuela.</i>

796
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:00,626
Okay.

797
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:02,161
That makes no sense.

798
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,832
And I'm done.

799
00:35:06,795 --> 00:35:09,664
Why would the heroine
live with her grandmother?

800
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:12,642
She's a grown-ass woman.

801
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:14,803
Can't she move out even if
she doesn't get the guy?

802
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,131
Yeah, I guess she can.

803
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:20,321
So why hasn't she?

804
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:22,771
I don't know.

805
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:24,637
Maybe she was waiting

806
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:26,919
for things to change.

807
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:29,969
Is she done waiting?

808
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,139
Yeah, she is.

809
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,642
And is she ready to not renovate?

810
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,817
No, I'm-I'm not she. You're she.

811
00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:40,065
Fine, fine.

812
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:41,301
Are you?

813
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:44,627
Bankrupting myself probably isn't the...

814
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:47,617
healthiest way to get over J.R.

815
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:01,385
Well, you were right. Uh...

816
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:03,086
River kissed me again.

817
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,742
I knew it.

818
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:06,612
I'm sorry. I told her off...

819
00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:08,381
In no uncertain terms, this time.

820
00:36:08,415 --> 00:36:09,533
Good!

821
00:36:09,882 --> 00:36:12,352
And you're not allowed to do
any sex scenes with her anymore.

822
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,730
Xiomara, she plays my wife.

823
00:36:14,912 --> 00:36:16,580
Sex scenes are involved.

824
00:36:16,613 --> 00:36:19,016
Then I'm gonna be there,
watching like a hawk.

825
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:20,051
I told her to back off.

826
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:21,352
She got the message this time.

827
00:36:21,386 --> 00:36:22,619
- I'm still coming.
- You can't.

828
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:24,056
- Why not?
- Because you being there

829
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:25,691
will make the situation worse.

830
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:26,892
Well, it's gonna be worse, then,

831
00:36:26,924 --> 00:36:28,524
- because I'll be there.
- You are not.

832
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:29,550
I forbid it.

833
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:30,784
You forbid it?

834
00:36:30,817 --> 00:36:32,486
Oh, excuse me,

835
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,755
I didn't realize we
were back in the cave!

836
00:36:35,014 --> 00:36:36,714
My work pays for this cave.

837
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:38,841
And I will not let you jeopardize my job

838
00:36:38,874 --> 00:36:40,677
because you're jealous and insecure.

839
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:42,077
Go to hell, Rogelio!

840
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:43,480
<i>Uh-oh. Looks like someone's</i>

841
00:36:43,512 --> 00:36:45,104
<i>the man of the doghouse.</i>

842
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,819
Okay, I'm sorry. Come back.

843
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:51,083
Xiomara, don't leave!

844
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:57,626
Wh-What is wrong? Why are you smiling?

845
00:36:57,784 --> 00:37:00,600
You called me jealous and insecure.

846
00:37:01,322 --> 00:37:02,680
And it hit me that...

847
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:04,612
that's true!

848
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:06,877
I am jealous and insecure!

849
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:09,264
And even though that's
a crappy feeling...

850
00:37:11,472 --> 00:37:13,848
that's a normal feeling.

851
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:16,729
Normal like before I had cancer.

852
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:18,467
You're right.

853
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:21,611
And I yelled at you for
being jealous and insecure!

854
00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:22,713
I know!

855
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:24,914
You never would have yelled
at me before the PET scan.

856
00:37:25,946 --> 00:37:26,939
Oh...

857
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:29,453
We're getting back to normal.

858
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:32,263
<i>Unlike Rogelio's last kiss,</i>

859
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:35,106
<i>this is a very wanted advance.</i>

860
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:36,281
Thank you for yelling at me.

861
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:38,902
I'm prepared to yell
at you all night long.

862
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:41,114
And after a five-year rest period,

863
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:42,734
I'll be ready to yell at you some more.

864
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:44,765
Oh, I plan to yell, too.

865
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,824
<i>And yes, friends, that's how Xo and Ro</i>

866
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,514
<i>got their groove back.</i>

867
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,562
<i>Not feeling so groovy...</i>

868
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:07,746
<i>Don't call her, Petra.</i>

869
00:38:07,779 --> 00:38:09,917
<i>You're moving forward, remember?</i>

870
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,556
P-Please. No... It's been torture,

871
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,758
not having you here.

872
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,693
Look, I-I... I need you back.

873
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:23,396
What we have doesn't
come around every day.

874
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:25,431
<i>So much for Petra's fresh start.</i>

875
00:38:25,463 --> 00:38:27,032
And you picked up the phone.

876
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:28,420
Look, you wouldn't have done that

877
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:30,793
if a small part of you
didn't miss me, too.

878
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:35,308
So what will it take for
you to come back to me?

879
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,669
I'd consider it

880
00:38:37,694 --> 00:38:39,062
for triple my salary.

881
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,096
Done. You're worth every penny.

882
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:44,122
<i>And way cheaper than
renovating the entire hotel.</i>

883
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:46,850
And I want a lunch hour every day.

884
00:38:47,212 --> 00:38:48,348
Every day?

885
00:38:48,738 --> 00:38:49,878
Good-bye, Mrs. Solano.

886
00:38:49,903 --> 00:38:50,905
It's a deal.

887
00:38:50,938 --> 00:38:51,905
But you start tomorrow.

888
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:54,382
See you then.

889
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:59,914
<i>Well, at least she got
one of her exes back.</i>

890
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:02,983
<i>And continuing our apology tour...</i>

891
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:05,798
And, again, I'm just so sorry.

892
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,771
It's your life,
and I had no right to criticize it.

893
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:17,569
Oh, you don't have to explain anything.

894
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,227
I'm glad.

895
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,032
Yeah, but it's a good one.

896
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:55,012
And it made me realize

897
00:39:55,742 --> 00:39:57,634
it's time for a change for me, too.

898
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,099
So... I'm moving out.

899
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,321
I know.

900
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:07,104
But what am I waiting for?

901
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:09,551
Mateo and I will get a studio,

902
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:10,981
which is what I can afford right now.

903
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:12,675
Down the road,
hopefully something bigger.

904
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:16,764
I don't.

905
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,527
I just think it's time for
the next phase in my life.

906
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:23,454
For what it's worth,

907
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:25,179
I totally agree.

908
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:28,079
<i>And speaking of
moving forward with life...</i>

909
00:40:28,223 --> 00:40:31,105
So... last night was nice.

910
00:40:31,906 --> 00:40:33,626
So was this morning.

911
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:35,758
It was.

912
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:39,816
But it didn't exactly solve

913
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:42,070
all my insecurity and jealousy.

914
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:44,816
I know.

915
00:40:45,274 --> 00:40:47,134
And you can come to set if you want to.

916
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:48,750
I don't want to.

917
00:40:48,775 --> 00:40:50,097
But that's the thing.

918
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:52,731
I want to get my own life back on track.

919
00:40:52,756 --> 00:40:54,528
Figure out what comes next.

920
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,049
And I want to trust you.

921
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,515
I should trust you.

922
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:02,352
Well, I should have trusted you

923
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:05,125
when you said you felt like
River didn't get the message.

924
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,991
But I promise you, Xiomara,

925
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:09,315
she got it this time.

926
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:11,218
<i>True, for the record.</i>

927
00:41:13,456 --> 00:41:16,369
<i>But while Rogelio's home life
might be back to normal...</i>

928
00:41:21,072 --> 00:41:24,909
<i>his work life is about
to get very uncomfortable.</i>

929
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:26,662
He loves me not.

930
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:30,419
He will pay.

931
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,713
He loves me not.

932
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:36,293
He will pay.

933
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:46,632
