1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,768
<i>Once upon a time, friends,</i>

2
00:00:02,793 --> 00:00:04,771
<i>Jane and Rafael had a baby.</i>

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,313
<i>But this isn't a fairy tale;
it's a telenovela.</i>

4
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,042
<i>So the baby was kidnapped
by the evil Sin Rostro.</i>

5
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:11,863
<i>I had a dragonfly brooch.</i>

6
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:13,623
<i>Get it, and I'll give you Mateo.</i>

7
00:00:13,657 --> 00:00:15,762
<i>Luckily, they got Mateo back.</i>

8
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:17,523
<i>And years later, Jane was writing</i>

9
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:18,950
<i>a book about what happened.</i>

10
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:20,717
<i>And she got an agent.</i>

11
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,785
<i>Also winning...</i>

12
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:24,355
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

13
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:27,725
<i>That's right, Petra gained
full ownership of the Marbella.</i>

14
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:29,794
<i>And since Rafael was once the owner...</i>

15
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,142
I want to offer you a job...

16
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:33,460
and a percentage of everything
we build together going forward.

17
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:35,129
<i>And he could really
use the distraction,</i>

18
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:36,598
<i>because his sister was still involved</i>

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,598
<i>with Sin Rostro.</i>

20
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,200
But she does have a plan, right?

21
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,468
Rose always has a plan.

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,848
<i>Now that everything is in place,</i>

23
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:46,243
we can move forward.
Is everyone ready?

24
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:48,613
<i>I know.
Straight out of a telenovela, right?</i>

25
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:51,581
<i>Well, imagine this: Jane's
father was a telenovela star.</i>

26
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:54,198
<i>But she didn't know him
until she was 23 years old.</i>

27
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:57,232
I can't believe you've only
been in my life for seven years.

28
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,905
<i>Oh, and Rogelio was
finally close to his dream:</i>

29
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,738
<i>bringing his telenovela
to an American audience.</i>

30
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,569
<i>Even if that meant
he wasn't the star.</i>

31
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,065
I'm okay being
sidelined just a little.

32
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:09,069
It's different for you.
You've got these

33
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:11,019
great relationships
with your daughters,

34
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:13,066
whereas mine barely
even speaks to me.

35
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:14,335
I can help you win her back.

36
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:16,337
<i>Ah, if only it were that easy.</i>

37
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,869
<i>But this is a telenovela.</i>

38
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:19,530
<i>So let's see what happens next.</i>

39
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:23,112
<i>As you all know by now,</i>

40
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:25,780
<i>our Jane grew up on telenovelas.</i>

41
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:29,118
<i>And, oh, how she loved the romance,</i>

42
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:31,126
<i>the drama...</i>

43
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:35,478
<i>The adventure.</i>

44
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,403
<i>But one thing she never loved?</i>

45
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:41,140
<i>The scary stuff.</i>

46
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:43,512
You'd better look,
or you won't know how it ends.

47
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,240
<i>Honestly, I can't blame her.</i>

48
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,051
<i>It's not my favorite, either.</i>

49
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:52,480
<i>But we can't hide
from the scares forever.</i>

50
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:53,861
So?

51
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:55,461
Is he dead?

52
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:56,621
You killed it.

53
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,732
The romance,
the drama, the adventure

54
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:03,121
in your novel are all great.

55
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:06,759
But the crime is totally
anticlimactic. You got to do better.

56
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:10,168
<i>She right, by the way.
See, even now,</i>

57
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:12,668
<i>Jane wasn't as interested
in the scary stuff.</i>

58
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:14,292
Anticlimactic because...?

59
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:16,155
Because the crime story ends
midway through

60
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,843
when the villain is sent to prison.

61
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:19,856
I kept expecting her
to come back like...

62
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:22,941
but she never did.

63
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,430
Because I wanted to end the
book on an uplifting note.

64
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:28,773
Joy, love, all that stuff.

65
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:31,376
Yeah, I get that,
but I don't 100% care.

66
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:33,802
I care about what the book needs.

67
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:35,135
If you want this book to sell,

68
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:37,913
you have got to embrace
the crime in a big way.

69
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,874
Build to an explosive climax.

70
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:41,831
Got it?

71
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:43,423
Yes.
Got it.

72
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:54,517

00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,344
<i>So, uh, an explosive...</i>

74
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,406
- crime climax.
- Do you want to brainstorm?

75
00:02:58,407 --> 00:02:59,742
- No, it's...
- Oh, yeah. Let's do it.

76
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:01,744
Don't worry about it.
It's what I'm here for. Okay.

77
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:04,245
Hmm, now, it can be anything,
but it has to threaten

78
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:06,247
everything and
has to be unexpected.

79
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:08,932
Maybe...

80
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:10,928
the villain comes back.

81
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:12,756
Or maybe one of her past crimes

82
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,895
comes to light in a...
in a new way,

83
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,023
like old tunnels leading
to a new hideout.

84
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:19,004
<i>Eh, I wouldn't exactly</i>

85
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,252
<i>call that an explosive climax.</i>

86
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,978
Or her ex-husband survives the cement.

87
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:25,758
<i>Got to do better, Lily.</i>

88
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:28,528
Oh, oh, I've got something good.

89
00:03:29,148 --> 00:03:30,373
What if...

90
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:31,799
when the villain kidnaps the baby,

91
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:33,891
she swaps it out for a different one?

92
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:36,806
<i>Oh. Wow.</i>

93
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:38,872
Scary, right?

94
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:42,475
Yeah, Th-that would be... terrifying.

95
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:44,354
<i>Agreed.</i>

96
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,010
<i>Don't go there, Jane.</i>

97
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:57,758
<i>Oh, no. She's going there.</i>

98
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,947
Oh, my God.

99
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,812
- Mommy's here.
<i>- Mommy?</i>

100
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:05,097
Can you fix this?

101
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:06,374
Mm-hmm.

102
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:13,866
<i>And from one anxious mother</i>

103
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:15,105
<i>to another.</i>

104
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:18,068
I had them flown in from your
favorite bakery in New York.

105
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:20,414
I know that you've been
homesick, and I

106
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:22,449
just wanted to give you
a little taste of home.

107
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:23,940
Yeah, cupcakes aren't
gonna make up for you

108
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:25,634
missing my entire childhood.

109
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:26,738
So...

110
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:31,408
See?

111
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:34,361
It's a total failure. I told you.

112
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,553
Have faith, River.

113
00:04:36,672 --> 00:04:39,202
She took a job on your show.
There's a reason for that.

114
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,702
Yeah. Money.

115
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:43,539
I pay her five times
what a normal P.A. makes.

116
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:46,171
<i>Wow. Almost a living wage.</i>

117
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:48,198
I-I think I just need to accept

118
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:49,833
we've got a crappy relationship

119
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:51,127
and move on.

120
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:53,435
Can you even hear yourself?

121
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,003
You cannot give up. What is the point

122
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:58,252
of all of this if you cannot
share it with your children?

123
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,346
Family is everything.
It's all that matters.

124
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,101
It's the network.

125
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,643
Rogelio de la Vega,
EP and costar.

126
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,122
Okay, okay. Thank you.
You won't regret this.

127
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:15,562
Bye.

128
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:17,388
They love the pilot.

129
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:20,291
They're ordering
<i>This Is Mars</i> to series.

130
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:22,292
We did it. We did it.

131
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:23,811
We have it all!

132
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,451
Not really.
Like you said,

133
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,345
family is everything.

134
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:30,371
My daughter still hates me.

135
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,310
Oh, it'll work itself out.
Here, have a cupcake.

136
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,003
We're going to series.

137
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:37,710
You're giving birth to a
show, and this baby will...

138
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:40,571
Definitely love you back!

139
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:42,123
<i>This is my baby.</i>

140
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,191
I need the pop-up to go perfectly.

141
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:46,446
It will.
The event is already sold out.

142
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,381
Tons of press are confirmed to attend.

143
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,539
You've obsessed over every detail,

144
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,571
including how much cologne
I'm allowed to wear.

145
00:05:52,596 --> 00:05:54,699
Which we agreed is zero, correct?

146
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:56,911
I can't have anything
interfering with Ludo's food.

147
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,805
Come on. Why are you so nervous?

148
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:00,340
Because...

149
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:03,265
Clarissa James is coming.

150
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:04,888
Ooh.

151
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:06,823
Is it someone you're seeing?

152
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:08,238
Come on, spill it.
I want to know everything.

153
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,940
Okay, stand down, girlfriend.

154
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:11,676
No. She's an investor.

155
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,304
Who specializes in hotel franchising.

156
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:14,897
As in franchising the Marbella?

157
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:17,430
I had no idea
you were even thinking about that.

158
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:19,499
Not thinking about it.
Dreaming about it.

159
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,349
I want a Marbella in every major city.

160
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,677
On every continent.

161
00:06:22,702 --> 00:06:24,572
- Does that sound insane?
- Yes.

162
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:26,426
But if anyone can pull it off...

163
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,109
I know. It's me, right?

164
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,809
I hadn't even
put out feelers yet.

165
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,511
Clarissa just got in
touch out of the blue.

166
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:34,172
Oh, I'm so excited,
I don't know how I'll sleep tonight.

167
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,395
- Jane.
- Hmm?

168
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:49,282
Are you okay?

169
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:50,990
Yeah.

170
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,705
My-my mom wants to start

171
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:55,107
our dance lessons for the wedding.

172
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,622
Dance lessons?

173
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,043
That's what's got you
tossing and turning?

174
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:02,400
Come on, what is it?

175
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:05,416
M-My agent...

176
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,719
was giving me notes on
the crime in my novel,

177
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,800
and... she said something crazy.

178
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:11,990
And I can't
get it out of my head

179
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:13,658
even though I know it's crazy.

180
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,197
Okay.

181
00:07:15,693 --> 00:07:17,346
Well, what did she say?

182
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,476
That Rose might have swapped Mateo

183
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,412
for another baby when
she kidnapped him.

184
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:26,152
Oh, my God.

185
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:28,257
- Oh, my God!
- Wait a second,

186
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,480
You're supposed to be
telling me that I'm crazy.

187
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:33,261
I-I'm sorry, but it-it's just Rose.

188
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:34,862
She's capable of anything.

189
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,288
<i>Oh, great.
Now I can't sleep.</i>

190
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,717
So you actually think
it's possible that Mateo

191
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,300
- was switched at birth?
- No.

192
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,328
I-I just mean, it's not...

193
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:50,097
impossible.

194
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:51,965
- Oh, my God.
- But wait. But wait. Okay.

195
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,902
Let's-let's just think this through

196
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:55,731
- before we both freak out.
- Too late.

197
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:57,639
<i>- Agreed.</i>
- Come on.

198
00:07:57,664 --> 00:07:59,404
Rose has a reason for everything.

199
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,207
Right? So there was
no motivation for her

200
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,908
to switch out Mateo.

201
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,819
She was only interested
in one thing at the time.

202
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,288
The brooch. Right.

203
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:07,900
Which she got.

204
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:09,758
So it doesn't make any sense for her

205
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,426
to give us back a
baby that wasn't ours.

206
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,780
That's true.
That's a really good point.

207
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,223
And that right there.

208
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:16,478
Okay? That crinkle.

209
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,080
In your forehead. Mateo has that same

210
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:20,683
exact crinkle in the same
place when he frowns.

211
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:22,751
- That's true.
- And do you remember when we

212
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,121
put my baby pictures side
by side next to Mateo's?

213
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:26,189
You were twins.

214
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,489
- Right?
- Right.

215
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:28,790
So, rationally, there's no way

216
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:30,592
Mateo isn't our son.

217
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:32,547
Your agent was just giving
you an idea for your book.

218
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:34,583
It's not real. End of story.

219
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:35,976
In fact, ask me again.

220
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:37,294
So, my agent said maybe...

221
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:38,603
That's crazy.

222
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:45,886
Okay. I feel better.

223
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,054
<i>I don't, honestly.</i>

224
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:49,221
Hey, Raf.

225
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,475
<i>And now neither does he.</i>

226
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,438
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling security.

227
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,425
Oh, no, I am leaving. For good.

228
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:58,718
I came to say goodbye.

229
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:00,966
Didn't we just do this?

230
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,402
Well, no, then I was just

231
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,002
going to an ashram for two weeks.

232
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:05,566
This is a more... permanent goodbye.

233
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:09,051
So goodbye.

234
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:11,850
Permanently.

235
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,857
Goodbye.

236
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,089
I heard you're getting married.

237
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:19,725
I'm so happy for you

238
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:22,402
and Jane, and I'm really
sorry for everything.

239
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,099
I really am.

240
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,032
I love you, Rafael.

241
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:29,631
Well, maybe that would
have meant something

242
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:31,445
if you weren't involved
with a criminal.

243
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:42,703
<i>- And speaking of crime...</i>
-

244
00:10:14,318 --> 00:10:16,047
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

245
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:19,427
I-I've been a fan of you and
your hotel since I started.

246
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,946
The first time I slid into a set

247
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:22,307
of Marcienne hotel sheets,

248
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:24,628
I think I wept a little.

249
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,386
Oh. Well, I only invest in the best.

250
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:30,880
Which is why I am honored you're
interested in helping me expand.

251
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,784
Well, actually,
it was my guru who suggested

252
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:34,584
that I take a look at the Marbella.

253
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:35,987
Uh...

254
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,057
Well, hey, whoever this guru
is, she sounds really smart.

255
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,577
I love her already.

256
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:43,735
Oh, good. Well, she's actually here.

257
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,244
I take her everywhere.

258
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,039
She helps me make all my decisions.

259
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:50,277
Maggie? Come on in.

260
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:54,869
Shalom. So very nice to meet you.

261
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:56,856
Petra, is it?

262
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:00,483
<i>Let the good times roll.</i>

263
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,424
I'm supposed to meet someone
here, uh... Jane Villanueva?

264
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:08,602
Oh, uh, hi. That's me.

265
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:12,391
Stop reading and say hello.

266
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,569
Are you my real mommy?

267
00:11:23,712 --> 00:11:25,743
<i>I can't live
with this uncertainty.</i>

268
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:28,213
I looked it up, and it might just be

269
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:29,981
a temporary skin
discoloration from labor,

270
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:32,083
but it could also be a birthmark,

271
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:34,353
and Mateo doesn't have a birthmark.

272
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:36,168
So, you want a DNA test?

273
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:38,974
No. I don't want one,
but we have to get one.

274
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,539
Rose had no motive to swap Mateo.

275
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:43,207
She's a sociopath, Rafael.

276
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,276
There is no rationalizing her motives.

277
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:47,149
You know it's possible.

278
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,670
But it's-it's not probable.

279
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:50,654
And I wish I could live with that.

280
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,990
But I can't.

281
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:56,621
Okay.

282
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:59,742
Okay. So we'll-we'll do the test.

283
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:01,626
Okay.

284
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:11,524
<i>Ah, friends, we last left
our Jane on a fact-finding mission.</i>

285
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,386
Okay, Mr. Sweetface, we just have to
swab your cheek really quickly.

286
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:15,568
Why?

287
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:16,993
It's just a little test

288
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:18,786
to make sure you're getting
enough vitamins in the morning.

289
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:20,027
Okay.

290
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:26,312
That's it?

291
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:28,631
That's it. Easy.

292
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:33,346
Don't worry.

293
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:35,390
It's gonna be fine.

294
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:44,329
Okay. Well, I'd better get to work.

295
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:45,864
Help Petra with...

296
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,865
Maggie.

297
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:49,000
What do you want?

298
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,870
To help you, dear daughter.

299
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,207
I met Clarissa in rehab.

300
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:56,627
Ugh, it was very boring,
so I watch a lot of Netflix.

301
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,656
There was this documentary,<i>
Wild Wild Country..</i>

302
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:01,075
Get to the point.

303
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:03,934
I become Clarissa's guru.

304
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:06,071
And then I give her Marbella idea.

305
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,440
You are welcome.

306
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,342
Now I want half of hotel.

307
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:10,776
I'm not negotiating.

308
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,411
- You should.
- Why?

309
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,384
- You don't have a leg to stand on.
<i>- Low blow, Petra.</i>

310
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:19,537
Okay. I just tell
Clarissa this hotel has bad juju,

311
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:21,362
and we will be on our way.

312
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:25,310
$500 a month for you
to leave the country

313
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:27,211
and never set foot in
the United States again.

314
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:30,438
That is nothing compared
to what I am giving you.

315
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:35,034
$5,000 a month. Final offer.

316
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,784
Well, my final offer is:
I want half of hotel.

317
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,175
Without me, you have no Clarissa.

318
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:44,763
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

319
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:47,088
We have a meeting with
the network in one hour.

320
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:48,381
Why are you not ready?

321
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:50,635
Are you sick? Is it terminal?

322
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,697
Do you think you could make
it five to seven more years?

323
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,012
I'm just getting an infusion
of B12 and C concentrates.

324
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,201
There's nothing wrong with her body.

325
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:00,637
This is about her soul.

326
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:02,304
<i>Oh. Is that all?</i>

327
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:04,374
I realized you were right.

328
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:07,042
Success means nothing
without the love and support

329
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:08,378
of my daughter.

330
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:10,480
And that will come. For sure.

331
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:13,501
But in the meantime,
we just got a show picked up.

332
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:15,641
By a major network.

333
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,372
Love and support that.

334
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:19,548
I can't. You see,

335
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,231
I had built up this
wall over the years,

336
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:30,124
and I've been able to keep
these huge emotions at bay.

337
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:33,565
But you, Rogelio,
you tore down that wall.

338
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,711
And now... I'm just overcome

339
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:39,712
with this painful,

340
00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:42,749
all-consuming emptiness.

341
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,019
Well, then let's rebuild that wall.

342
00:14:46,223 --> 00:14:48,321
We can do it together brick by brick.

343
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,059
There's no going back.

344
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:52,561
This River's dam has burst.

345
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:55,034
Right now, all I can do is get back

346
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:57,215
into intensive psychotherapy.

347
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:58,800
And who knows?

348
00:14:58,801 --> 00:15:01,253
Maybe the fact that I'm
turning down the chance

349
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:03,302
for a big successful hit show

350
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:05,779
and the millions of
dollars that come with it

351
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:07,812
will impress Pond.

352
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:09,538
What are you talking about?

353
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:11,107
I'm sorry, Rogelio.

354
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,144
I can't accept the pickup.

355
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,912
<i>Calm down, Rogelio.</i>

356
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:19,181
<i>Inhala, exhala.</i>

357
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:20,349
You can fix this.

358
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:21,584
You just need to talk to Pond.

359
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:23,453
You can get through to her.

360
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:25,053
You're the daughter whisperer.

361
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:26,582
Bye.

362
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:28,831
If now is not a good
time, we can come back.

363
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:32,084
No. Rogelio's good, and your
wedding dance has to be great.

364
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,367
Besides, this is the perfect way
to keep me from

365
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,677
stressing about my
first day of nursing school.

366
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,938
- Just three days away.
- What did I just say?

367
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,941
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Sorry. Sorry.

368
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,523
Ah. Oops.

369
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,075
All right, let's dance.
You guys watch the video?

370
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,498
- We did.
- Yep.

371
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:58,427
Mateo's ours. Don't worry.

372
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:00,660
- He is, right?
- Yes.

373
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:06,530
You guys are a little stiff.

374
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:07,609
I...

375
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,612
Sorry, we're both just
stressed about work.

376
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:17,048
<i>And the results
of a certain DNA test.</i>

377
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,238
Come on, Ma.
Let's show them how it's done.

378
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:24,689
Abuela.

379
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:26,725
Who knew you could move
your hips like that.

380
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:29,526
Oh, Alba's got moves.
I read all about Pablo

381
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,262
in Jane's book.

382
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:36,345
Uh... well, yeah.

383
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:47,946
I mean... yeah.

384
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,339
But when you read
the beginning of my book,

385
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:57,120
about Venezuela,
you were fine with it.

386
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,373
You didn't think my
book was going anywhere?

387
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:12,279
Oh, this is about Jorge?

388
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:16,859
- You brought him up.
- Okay, why doesn't everybody

389
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:19,272
just take a breath.
I'm sure we can find a solution.

390
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,961
What?! But...

391
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:31,397
I drove you here.

392
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:38,286
Mom, you're calling me.

393
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:51,078
<i>Ah, yes, we last left our Jane</i>

394
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,646
<i>trying to rewrite her
grandmother's story.</i>

395
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:02,412
- Look at you two!
- I found the perfect partner

396
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:04,759
to help me finish choreographing
your wedding dance.

397
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,421
Show Mommy your twirl.

398
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,611
Bravo, Mr. Sweetface.

399
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,793
Thank you so much
for watching him today.

400
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:13,816
Of course.
How's the writing going?

401
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:16,682
I mean,
I'm taking out the central theme,

402
00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:19,297
so not much makes sense in the
book anymore, but, you know...

403
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:21,020
I'm sorry, hon.

404
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:23,113
Ah, it's okay. I'm just frustrated.

405
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:25,866
I was already struggling
with notes from my agent.

406
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:27,972
Didn't know I was gonna have to deal

407
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,442
with notes from my<i> abuela,</i> too.

408
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:31,360
You know what?
Send the book to me.

409
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,629
I'll give it to her.

410
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:33,998
Trust me, she'll feel differently

411
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,633
when she actually reads it.

412
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:37,514
<i>What are you reading?</i>

413
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,772
What are you doing here?

414
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:45,412
This is my favorite... coffee shop

415
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:47,795
slash, uh, computer place

416
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:49,731
slash eatery.

417
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:50,932
So hip.

418
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:53,264
Okay, fine. I tracked you down

419
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:54,966
because your mom is really hurting.

420
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:58,010
Don't you think it might
be time to forgive her?

421
00:18:58,515 --> 00:18:59,515
No.

422
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:02,365
Let me paint you a
painful little picture.

423
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,616
It's 2004, the year my mother won

424
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,148
her Emmy for that HBO
movie,<i> Plath on Plath:</i>

425
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:08,486
<i>The Sylvia Plath Story.</i>

426
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:10,690
"As told by the ghost
of Sylvia Plath."

427
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:12,548
Of course. She slayed.

428
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:15,341
I'm sorry. Please continue.

429
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:16,942
So, it's the night of the Emmys.

430
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:18,503
My three best friends
are sleeping over

431
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:19,804
so we can all watch.

432
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:21,506
I was so excited and proud,

433
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:24,808
because wow,
my mom was just so cool.

434
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,393
And then she wins.

435
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:31,300
And there's my mom accepting
her Emmy on live TV

436
00:19:31,332 --> 00:19:33,686
in front of millions of people.

437
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:35,180
And then...

438
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:37,186
You know what?

439
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:39,314
Let me just show you.

440
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:42,156
Wow.

441
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,525
Oh! What an honor.

442
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,229
Um, oh, there are so
many people to thank.

443
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,472
Everybody at HBO.

444
00:19:49,497 --> 00:19:50,932
Our writers.

445
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:53,612
The cast. Our amazing crew.

446
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:56,847
Ah, my dog walkers, Yuri and Marigold.

447
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,097
Bless.

448
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:00,366
My, uh, my-my acupuncturist,

449
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,532
Dr. Mishka. Genius.

450
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,528
And finally...

451
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:08,612
I want to thank the most
important person in my life.

452
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:12,449
The person who inspires
me every day to be...

453
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:15,184
the best person I can possibly be...

454
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:18,102
my agent, Don Sherwood.

455
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:20,273
I love you, Don.

456
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:23,177
Oh, God,
I can't believe I almost forgot.

457
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,707
Um, sweetheart...

458
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,210
I love you so much.

459
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:30,215
This is nothing without you.

460
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:32,191
Carrie, my publicist.

461
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:34,421
I love you, I love you, love you.

462
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:37,113
<i>Oof. That was bad on bad.</i>

463
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,562
Worst night of my life,

464
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:43,220
and nothing she does
will ever change that.

465
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:44,470
Understand?

466
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:45,773
<i>Of course I understand,</i>

467
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:48,639
but now my dream show is dying,

468
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,838
and there's no help in sight.
I'm doomed.

469
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:07,268
All right,
ready for some dancing?

470
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,861
Jane.

471
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,546
And what did you think?

472
00:21:20,682 --> 00:21:21,784
Abuela, it's fiction.

473
00:21:33,453 --> 00:21:36,446
Ma, you have to understand how hard
Jane has worked on this book.

474
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:39,051
If you make her take out more,
the rest will fall apart.

475
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:56,300
It's okay, Abuela.
I understand.

476
00:21:56,434 --> 00:21:59,133
It's your story.
You have the right to decide

477
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:00,447
if it gets told.

478
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:03,076
I'll rewrite the book. No problem.

479
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:10,576
A rewrite. Of course.

480
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:14,315
Oh, sorry. Uh, carry on.

481
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:16,363
I just realized that a rewrite

482
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:18,621
could solve all my problems, too.

483
00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:20,433
But you two, keep fighting.

484
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:21,735
Uh,

485
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:23,496
we're not fighting.

486
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,808
Everything's okay.

487
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,389
And by "okay," I mean that I
have to do a huge rewrite now

488
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,150
and...

489
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:37,416
Uh, hey, Mr. Sweetface,
uh, want to go to your room

490
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,452
and color, yeah? Okay.

491
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:43,548
The DNA results?

492
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:49,672
<i>Before she opens it,</i>

493
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:52,095
<i>I will remind you
this is a telenovela,</i>

494
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:55,230
<i>so the unexpected
is to be expected.</i>

495
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:09,579
Oh...

496
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:19,955
Oh, I'm so relieved.

497
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:22,018
I know.

498
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,670
But this is it, right?

499
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:29,702
Because getting a DNA test
for our son is just too much.

500
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:33,620
You're right.
I am gonna separate fact from fiction

501
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:37,091
and get over this fear.

502
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:39,308
<i>- Which, for the record,</i>
-

503
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,431
<i>she was trying to do.</i>

504
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,382
<i>Also trying hard...</i>

505
00:23:46,415 --> 00:23:48,751
As you can see,
our guests feel transported

506
00:23:48,783 --> 00:23:50,518
from the moment they enter the hotel.

507
00:23:50,551 --> 00:23:51,887
They would feel more transported

508
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,704
if the drinks were stronger.

509
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:56,025
This tastes like virgin smoothie.

510
00:23:56,058 --> 00:23:57,827
Well, people do like alcohol

511
00:23:57,859 --> 00:23:58,961
on holiday.

512
00:23:59,382 --> 00:24:00,762
Noted.

513
00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:07,624
<i>Ah, yes. Let me remind you,</i>

514
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:12,184
<i>these two have a wild, wild history.</i>

515
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,310
You should get
back to work now, Alba.

516
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:15,877
Now, if you'll follow
me up to this platform,

517
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,345
Clarissa, you can actually see

518
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:19,999
- a view of the ocean from our lobby.
- Ooh!

519
00:24:20,448 --> 00:24:22,417
- I can't get up.
- A shame.

520
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:23,786
So here's what I'm thinking.

521
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:26,289
The pop-up attracts the adults, okay?

522
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:28,837
<i>All right,
things are looking good here.</i>

523
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,073
<i>Not as good here.</i>

524
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:34,130
What's going on, hon?

525
00:24:34,163 --> 00:24:36,199
Did Jorge call you? Shoot.

526
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:38,067
I came here for a change of scenery,

527
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:39,769
and because I wrote most

528
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:42,292
of my book here,
I thought I might get inspired.

529
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:43,867
Well, let me talk to Abuela again

530
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,284
and see if she'll change her mind.

531
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:46,881
No, don't. It's her life.

532
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:49,322
Besides, I can concentrate
on this instead of the crime

533
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:51,283
which is driving me nuts
and making me do things

534
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:52,952
like get a DNA test for Mateo.

535
00:24:52,984 --> 00:24:54,242
What?

536
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:57,409
I got it in my head that
Rose switched babies.

537
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,449
Oh, sweetie.

538
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:00,824
I know.

539
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:03,010
She didn't, but she could've, Mom,

540
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:04,847
because she's so dangerous,

541
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:07,150
which is why I'm wondering
if it's even safe for me

542
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:09,885
to publish a book about a mass
murderer who's still alive.

543
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,811
- Well, you changed details.
- Enough?

544
00:25:11,935 --> 00:25:13,928
Rose could be really
pissed, and she has

545
00:25:13,953 --> 00:25:15,293
associates outside of prison.

546
00:25:15,318 --> 00:25:16,887
What if she sends someone

547
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:18,373
to threaten me and my
family, or worse?

548
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:21,729
Hon, you have to get
her out of your head.

549
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:24,175
I know.

550
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,085
I just don't know how.

551
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,201
<i>As you'll recall, Jane was</i>

552
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:35,799
<i>struggling to separate
truth from fiction.</i>

553
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:37,513
Oh!

554
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:40,351
Don't worry, Abuela,
I'm doing a big rewrite.

555
00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:41,611
I-I'm actually thinking of

556
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:43,312
changing the character
to a grandfather.

557
00:25:43,346 --> 00:25:45,189
<i>Hmm. I'd like to see that.</i>

558
00:25:45,214 --> 00:25:47,145
Why are you crying, Abuelo?

559
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,652
Pa.

560
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,670
What?
Did Mom talk to you?

561
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:58,964
I told her not to.

562
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:02,339
Then who was it?

563
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:09,601
Jorge?

564
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:12,684
Oh, Jane, hi.
Is the soccer game too loud?

565
00:26:12,716 --> 00:26:14,851
Oh, oh, no no, nothing like that.

566
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:17,320
I-I-I just wanted to say thank you

567
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:20,123
for getting my<i> abuela</i> to
change her mind about my novel.

568
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:22,576
Saved you a ton of work, huh?

569
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:24,444
Uh, you sure did.

570
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:36,333
I feel like there might
be more you want to say.

571
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:37,903
Yeah. Sorry.

572
00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:39,906
I was just wondering what
exactly you said to her.

573
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,785
I just helped her understand
why this was so hard for her.

574
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:47,829
Because of her friends at church?

575
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,599
More than that.

576
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:53,309
Being undocumented for so long,

577
00:26:53,462 --> 00:26:55,857
you get used to living
with these walls up,

578
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:57,735
keeping things secret.

579
00:26:58,178 --> 00:27:00,504
And living like that, it changes you

580
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,540
and how you relate to the world.

581
00:27:02,812 --> 00:27:06,103
It makes you more closed off.

582
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:10,320
So I just reminded her that
things are different for us now,

583
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:12,923
which is something we're
still getting used to,

584
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:15,415
but we're gonna do it together.

585
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:19,174
Well, I'm really glad my<i>
abuela</i> has you in her life.

586
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:22,308
I'm glad I do, too.

587
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:23,944
Me, too.

588
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:28,089
Can I put the game back on?

589
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,755
Yes, of course.

590
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,659
<i>Your game's just about over.</i>

591
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:33,990
I got Clarissa halfway
there without you already.

592
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,090
She wants to invest. I'm gonna
close the deal at the pop-up.

593
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:39,259
I can change her mind before that.

594
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:41,162
Yes, but you won't.

595
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,146
- Let me out!
- Be quiet.

596
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,186
There's some water in
there and some crackers.

597
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:51,007
I need a security
guard at the offices.

598
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,206
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

599
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:55,823
Why is it so dark in here?

600
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:57,994
Where is everybody?

601
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,505
Hello?

602
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,791
Why are you dressed like that?

603
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,186
Your e-mail said we were
doing reshoots today.

604
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,121
We are. Just not for the show.

605
00:28:07,378 --> 00:28:10,301
Today, we are reshooting life.

606
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:12,193
<i>Yes, friends, the line</i>

607
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:13,628
<i>between truth and fiction</i>

608
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:15,262
<i>is getting blurrier by the moment.</i>

609
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:18,331
I... can't believe it.

610
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:19,436
I know.

611
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:21,506
This dress still fits me after
all these years.

612
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:24,393
I actually had to
take it in a tiny bit.

613
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:32,014
Oh, Pond, uh, even though I
know I can't go back in time,

614
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,191
I realize how much

615
00:28:34,216 --> 00:28:36,843
I hurt you in the past
by not telling you

616
00:28:36,868 --> 00:28:38,103
how important you were to me

617
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:39,271
when I had the chance,

618
00:28:39,956 --> 00:28:41,524
so I've re-created

619
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:43,593
that night so I can
finally do it right.

620
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:50,388
Is... is that my bedroom
from middle school?

621
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:53,392
Down to the very
last butterfly clip.

622
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:57,190
Though I'm very sorry to report
that your Tamagotchi has died.

623
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,366
I know you had a sleepover
with your friends that night,

624
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,336
so I would be so grateful
if you would oblige me

625
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:05,996
and put on your PJs.

626
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:10,309
This is insane.
No, I'm not doing this.

627
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:11,911
Really? Because, uh,

628
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:14,312
Jemma and Taylor and Chartreuse

629
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:16,348
will be so disappointed.

630
00:29:23,144 --> 00:29:25,265
<i>Get me out of here!</i>

631
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,219
Let me out now!

632
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:29,065
I have to go number two.

633
00:29:29,545 --> 00:29:31,280
I'm under strict orders, ma'am.

634
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,700
Petra said you're a dirty charlatan

635
00:29:32,732 --> 00:29:34,367
and I shouldn't trust a word you say.

636
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:35,568
<i>That's fair.</i>

637
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:38,372
Please, I'm dying.

638
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:42,276
My blood...
will be on your hands.

639
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:54,721
<i>Wow.</i>

640
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:56,523
I can't believe you're all here.

641
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:59,526
Yeah, we thought maybe you were dying,

642
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:02,428
but since your mom offered to
put us up at a five-star hotel,

643
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:04,111
we didn't really ask questions.

644
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,218
So... Tay Tay,

645
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:09,084
haven't seen you in forever.

646
00:30:09,116 --> 00:30:12,034
Yeah, not since you
stole my boyfriend.

647
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:14,261
<i>Tay Tay was pi-pissed.</i>

648
00:30:14,295 --> 00:30:16,331
Jemma, you still have braces?

649
00:30:16,363 --> 00:30:18,432
The make-up department
forced me to put these on

650
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:20,718
for "maximum authenticity."

651
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:22,453
They really hurt.

652
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:25,468
Gracias.

653
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:28,855
All art is sacred and fleeting,

654
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:32,001
so when an actress steps into a role,

655
00:30:32,034 --> 00:30:33,535
she's transformed,

656
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,664
however briefly, into...

657
00:30:37,674 --> 00:30:39,609
Anyway, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

658
00:30:39,643 --> 00:30:40,611
And the winner

659
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:43,142
for Outstanding Lead Actress

660
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:46,242
in a Limited Series is...

661
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:47,013
River Fields.

662
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,149
Oh!

663
00:30:50,252 --> 00:30:51,760
Thank you.

664
00:30:51,969 --> 00:30:56,270
You know, I-I don't think
that I would've been prepared

665
00:30:56,462 --> 00:31:00,433
for my starring role in<i>
Plath on Plath</i> had I not had

666
00:31:01,282 --> 00:31:04,198
a very special person in my life.

667
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:07,715
My daughter, Pond.

668
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:12,687
You know, they say that,
um, a pond needs a river

669
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,992
to sustain it...

670
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:15,283
<i>They do?</i>

671
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,622
But I think it's the other way around.

672
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:18,778
Pond,

673
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:21,691
y-you fill me up.

674
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:23,153
You...

675
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:26,372
you teach me so much every day.

676
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:29,431
I would be nothing without you.

677
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:39,843
And while we can't go back in time,

678
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:43,548
I can now say I'm sorry.

679
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:48,002
I'm sorry that I wasn't there
for you all those years.

680
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:52,283
I thought my Emmy win was
the highlight of my life,

681
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,674
but reconnecting with
you is the real climax.

682
00:31:59,342 --> 00:32:01,284
This is so crazy.

683
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,356
And sweet.

684
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,715
Oh...

685
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,501
Stop her!

686
00:32:28,427 --> 00:32:29,429
<i>Sakra.</i>

687
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:34,079
So, we meet again.

688
00:32:34,773 --> 00:32:35,874
What are you up to

689
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:37,943
this time, Magda?

690
00:32:37,976 --> 00:32:39,555
I'm not up to anything.

691
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,849
I'm calling security.

692
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:43,243
I would not do that if I were you.

693
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:45,158
I know people.

694
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:48,208
I don't want something
to happen to you again.

695
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,793
Are you threatening me?

696
00:32:51,407 --> 00:32:52,748
It is not a threat.

697
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,939
It is a promise.

698
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,317
I do not get joke.

699
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,619
I got all that on my phone,

700
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,689
so if you don't leave town forever,

701
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:09,923
you're going back to jail.

702
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:12,187
Or did you forget that threatening me

703
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:13,790
is a violation of your parole

704
00:33:13,823 --> 00:33:16,770
and it comes with a
mandatory five-year sentence?

705
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:18,949
But I am not scared of you anymore,

706
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:21,025
because I am an American now, bitch!

707
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,048
Okay. Okay.

708
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,462
- I'll leave.
- And remember,

709
00:33:28,893 --> 00:33:30,862
If I ever see you around here

710
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:31,962
ever again,

711
00:33:31,963 --> 00:33:34,166
I'll take this recording
straight to the police.

712
00:33:39,244 --> 00:33:41,020
<i>Don't delete it, Alba.</i>

713
00:33:42,924 --> 00:33:43,983
<i>OMG.</i>

714
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:45,705
<i>She finally learned
how to work her phone.</i>

715
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:49,143
<i>Not working as well...</i>

716
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:53,028
<i>Our Jane.</i>

717
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,635
Thank you, Abuela.
I'm trying to crack this crime story.

718
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,043
I even prayed about it.

719
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:07,373
What?

720
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:20,790
You confronted Magda?

721
00:34:25,207 --> 00:34:27,144
<i>And just like that, Jane realized</i>

722
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:29,019
<i>what she needed to do in her novel,</i>

723
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:31,247
<i>a way for the crime to climax.</i>

724
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,182
A confrontation. That's it.

725
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:35,242
Yes. I don't need to
build up the crime.

726
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:36,691
I need to build up the heroine.

727
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:38,678
Mm... mwah!

728
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:41,208
Wow, looks like somebody
had a breakthrough.

729
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:42,701
A big one, yes.

730
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:44,394
And I wrote it, and it feels right

731
00:34:44,427 --> 00:34:45,596
for the book,

732
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,664
and now I think I need to do it, too.

733
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:48,900
Do what, too?

734
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,614
Confront Rose.

735
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,081
I want to go see her.

736
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,730
I think I changed my mind.

737
00:35:02,755 --> 00:35:03,956
Oh, good.

738
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,939
I wasn't sure seeing Rose in
person was a good idea anyway.

739
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,005
<i>Oh, thank God. Me, neither.</i>

740
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:10,870
I meant I changed my
mind about the dress.

741
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:12,072
I think I'd feel more comfortable

742
00:35:12,105 --> 00:35:13,314
confronting Rose in pants.

743
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:15,149
<i>Oh.</i>

744
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:17,391
Got it. Good choice.

745
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,882
No. Wh-What do you mean you're
not sure it's a great idea?

746
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:21,385
And why didn't you say
anything last night?

747
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,721
I-I... I'm just worried
that seeing her in person

748
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:26,463
might upset you even more.

749
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,718
But I was just trying
to be supportive,

750
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,142
and you were so determined.

751
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:33,447
I am determined, because I can't

752
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,615
keep letting Rose have
this power over me.

753
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:39,052
If I can just see her behind
bars and say my piece to her,

754
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:40,940
I really think I'll
be able to move on.

755
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,074
I need to do this.

756
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,287
I just need to do this in pants.

757
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:50,609
Okay.
Okay.

758
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,192
I accept your deal.

759
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:53,593
5,000 a month.

760
00:35:53,627 --> 00:35:55,360
Oh, Mother, you escaped.

761
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:57,658
Good for you. But you're too late.

762
00:35:58,278 --> 00:36:00,673
I closed the deal with
Clarissa last night.

763
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:03,657
So your stock is bottoming out.

764
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:05,595
I'll give you 500 a month

765
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,976
to leave and never come back.

766
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,672
500 a...

767
00:36:11,697 --> 00:36:14,599
Uh, very generous.

768
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,600
I will take it.

769
00:36:17,902 --> 00:36:19,523
I leave town tonight.

770
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:21,708
Where will you go?

771
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,158
To live with your other twin.

772
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,151
The triplet.

773
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,947
<i>Wait. Truth or fiction?</i>

774
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:32,029
Don't try to get in my head, Mother.

775
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:33,653
Get out of here.

776
00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:45,291
<i>What a day.</i>

777
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:46,885
I don't know what I was nervous about.

778
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,384
Nursing school was great.

779
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,695
I was totally prepared from
all the reading I'd done,

780
00:36:50,728 --> 00:36:53,031
and there were a lot of
older students like me,

781
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:54,599
so I didn't feel out of place.

782
00:36:54,632 --> 00:36:56,835
I love seeing you so happy, Xiomara.

783
00:36:56,869 --> 00:36:58,304
I am.

784
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:02,340
Ah. River!

785
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:06,911
How is my talented costar
slash super-mother?

786
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,976
Ah, I can't thank you enough, Rogelio.

787
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,003
You truly are the daughter whisperer.

788
00:37:11,035 --> 00:37:12,320
Oh, stop.

789
00:37:12,345 --> 00:37:15,983
I just did what any caring, handsome

790
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:18,594
and extremely brilliant
person would do.

791
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,869
Well, thanks to you, Pond and I
have really turned things around.

792
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:23,738
I'm so happy for you.

793
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,345
Does this mean that
the show is back on?

794
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,745
It absolutely is.

795
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,141
Oh, thank God.

796
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:31,648
But we're moving it to New York.

797
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,895
Wait, what?

798
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,057
Pond really wants to move back
home, and like you said,

799
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,758
I have to put family first.

800
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:41,047
And luckily,

801
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:43,561
my contract says I can move
the show wherever I want,

802
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,090
and I want this.

803
00:37:45,115 --> 00:37:46,378
For my family.

804
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:52,811
But, uh, what about my family?

805
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,232
I-I know it's going to be
a tough decision for you.

806
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,867
I'd hate to recast.

807
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:09,622
I'm so nervous.

808
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:11,828
I know.

809
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:14,347
But you can do this. And...

810
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:16,048
if you change your
mind, that's okay, too.

811
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,218
We can turn around,
separate life from art.

812
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:21,338
I can't.

813
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:23,474
<i>It's hard, for the record,</i>

814
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,291
<i>to keep them from colliding.</i>

815
00:38:26,492 --> 00:38:27,226
Whoa.

816
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,451
What the hell?

817
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:32,413
<i>Which brings us to our climax.</i>

818
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:37,418
Guard, uh, there's something
in here I think you should see.

819
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:43,523
<i>And what is all too real, relatively.</i>

820
00:38:43,733 --> 00:38:45,824
I think you should
probably call this in.

821
00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:48,360
I seem to be losing a lot of blood.

822
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:50,747
Hurry up and grab your bag.

823
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:51,786
Now?

824
00:39:15,951 --> 00:39:17,638
Okay. Now, run.

825
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:24,344
Police! Stop!

826
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:25,412
Freeze!

827
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:26,446
Get her!

828
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,447
Stop! Stop them!

829
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:52,673
I'm here to see Rose.

830
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,559
Dennis, what are you doing here?

831
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:55,861
What's going on?

832
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:57,496
I'm afraid you can't see her.

833
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:58,897
What? Why?

834
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:00,286
<i>Rose escaped.</i>

835
00:40:07,377 --> 00:40:08,407
Luisa.

836
00:40:09,812 --> 00:40:10,671
Finally.

837
00:40:12,082 --> 00:40:13,717
- Rose escaped?
- But we knew

838
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,052
She was gonna try because of Luisa.

839
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:16,713
Of course

840
00:40:16,745 --> 00:40:17,565
she was involved.

841
00:40:17,566 --> 00:40:19,333
No, it's not what you think.

842
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,816
We're gonna spend the rest
of our lives together, baby,

843
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:25,320
somewhere where no
one can ever find us.

844
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:32,106
- You're under arrest.
<i>- Luisa's actually</i>

845
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,794
<i>Been working with us for months.</i>

846
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:35,121
Luisa betrayed me?

847
00:40:35,154 --> 00:40:36,656
I had no idea. I swear.

848
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:38,637
- Police!
<i>- Because of your sister,</i>

849
00:40:38,662 --> 00:40:40,646
<i>We were able to uncover
Rose's escape plan,</i>

850
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:41,894
<i>cut off her supply of funds</i>

851
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:43,790
<i>and send in the team to capture her.</i>

852
00:40:44,189 --> 00:40:46,193
She couldn't tell you the
truth for your own safety.

853
00:40:46,763 --> 00:40:49,300
So you guys caught her,
and she'll be back in prison.

854
00:40:49,325 --> 00:40:50,694
Unfortunately, things didn't

855
00:40:50,727 --> 00:40:51,521
<i>go as planned.</i>

856
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:54,247
Sorry.

857
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:06,709
<i>And she escaped again.</i>

858
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:11,121
<i>I know.</i>

859
00:41:11,122 --> 00:41:13,424
<i>Talk about scary stuff.</i>

860
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:18,510
