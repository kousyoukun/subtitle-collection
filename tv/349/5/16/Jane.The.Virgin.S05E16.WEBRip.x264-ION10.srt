00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,870
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, friends,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,220
Jane and Rafael had a baby.
But this isn't

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,260
a fairy tale;
it's a telenovela.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,310
So the baby was kidnapped
by the evil Sin Rostro.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,010
ROSE:
I had a dragonfly brooch.

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,700
Get it,
and I'll give you Mateo.

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,010
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Luckily, they got Mateo back.

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,490
And years later,
Jane was writing

9
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,060
a book about what happened.

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,750
And she got an agent.

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,840
Also winning...

12
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,280
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,760
That's right, Petra gained full ownership of the Marbella.

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,850
And since
Rafael was once the owner...

15
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,240
I want to offer you a
job-- and a percentage

16
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,720
of everything we build
together going forward.

17
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,330
And he could really use
the distraction,

18
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,940
because his sister
was still involved

19
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,950
with Sin Rostro.

20
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,430
But she does have a plan, right?

21
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,080
Rose always has a plan.[door creaks]

22
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,820
ROSE:
Now that everything
is in place,

23
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,480
we can move forward.
Is everyone ready?

24
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,000
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know. Straight out
of a telenovela, right?

25
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,570
Well, imagine this: Jane's
father was a telenovela star.

26
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,400
But she didn't know him
until she was 23 years old.

27
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,360
I can't believe you've only
been in my life for seven years.

28
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,530
Oh, and Rogelio was finally
close to his dream:

29
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,100
bringing his telenovela
to an American audience.

30
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,060
Even if that meant
he wasn't the star.

31
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,240
I'm okay being sidelined
just a little.

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,410
It's different for you.
You've got these great

33
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,980
relationships with
your daughters,

34
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,160
whereas mine barely
even speaks to me.

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,550
I can help you win her back.

36
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,550
Ah, if only it were that easy.

37
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,900
But this is a telenovela.

38
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,470
So let's see what happens next.

39
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,250
As you all know by now,

40
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,120
our Jane
grew up on telenovelas.

41
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,260
And, oh, how she loved
the romance,

42
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,390
the drama...

43
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,440
...the adventure.

44
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,090
But one thing
she never loved?

45
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,530
[heroine screams] The scary stuff.

46
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,490
You'd better look,
or you won't know how it ends.

47
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,320
Honestly, I can't blame her.

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
It's not my favorite, either.

49
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,280
[horrified gasps]

50
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,460
But we can't hide
from the scares forever.

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,020
So?

52
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,460
Is he dead?

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,680
You killed it.

54
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,680
[exhales, chuckles]

55
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,460
The romance, the
drama, the adventure

56
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,290
in your novel are all great.

57
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,560
But the crime is
totally anticlimactic.

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,030
You got to do better.

59
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,520
She right, by the way.
See, even now,

60
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,610
Jane wasn't as interested
in the scary stuff.

61
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,520
Anticlimactic because...?

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,170
Because the crime story
ends midway through

63
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,180
when the villain
is sent to prison.

64
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,090
I kept expecting her to
come back like... [yells]

65
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,880
but she never did.

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,580
Because I wanted to end the book
on an uplifting note.

67
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,800
Joy, love, all that stuff.

68
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,280
Yeah, I get that,
but I don't 100% care.

69
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,580
I care about what
the book needs.

70
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,850
If you want this book
to sell, you have got

71
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,850
to embrace the
crime in a big way.

72
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,810
Build to an
explosive climax.

73
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,200
Got it?

74
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,590
[chuckles] Yes.

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,720
Got it. [yells]

76
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,560
JANE:
So, uh, an explosive...

77
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,610
crime climax.Do you want to brainstorm?

78
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,090
No, it's...
Oh, yeah.
Let's do it.

79
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,090
Don't worry about it.
It's what I'm here for. Okay.

80
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,440
Hmm, now, it can be anything,
but it has to threaten

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,440
everything and has
to be unexpected.

82
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,970
Maybe...

83
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,580
the villain comes back.

84
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,360
Or maybe one of
her past crimes

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,750
comes to light in
a... in a new way,

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,930
like old tunnels leading
to a new hideout.

87
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,800
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Eh, I wouldn't exactly

88
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,240
call that an explosive climax.

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,020
Or her ex-husband
survives the cement.

90
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,720
Got to do better, Lily.

91
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,940
[gasps, yells]

92
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,460
Oh, oh, I've got
something good.

93
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,340
What if...

94
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,900
when the villain
kidnaps the baby,

95
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,300
she swaps it out
for a different one?

96
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,210
Oh. Wow.

97
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,910
Scary, right?

98
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,390
Yeah, th-that would be...
terrifying.

99
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,390
Agreed.

100
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,400
Don't go there, Jane.

101
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,750
Oh, no. She's going there.

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,240
JANE:
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,500
Mommy's here.MATEO: Mommy?

104
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,280
Can you fix this?

105
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,680
Mm-hmm.[toy rattling]

106
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,290
And from one anxious mother
to another.

107
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,470
I had them flown in from your
favorite bakery in New York.

108
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,300
I know that you've
been homesick, and I

109
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
just wanted to give you
a little taste of home.

110
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,690
Yeah, cupcakes
aren't gonna make up for

111
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,300
you missing my entire childhood.

112
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,000
So...

113
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,400
[exhales]

114
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,830
See?

115
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,440
It's a total failure.
I told you.

116
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,530
Have faith, River.

117
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,490
She took a job on your show.
There's a reason for that.

118
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,970
Yeah. Money.

119
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,320
I pay her five times
what a normal P.A. makes.

120
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,280
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow. Almost a living wage.

121
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,330
[sighs] I-I think I
just need to accept

122
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,850
we've got a crappy
relationship

123
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,370
and move on.

124
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,420
Can you even hear yourself?

125
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,770
You cannot give up.
What is the point

126
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,510
of all of this if you cannot
share it with your children?

127
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,640
Family is everything.
It's all that matters.

128
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,430
[cell phone ringing]

129
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,390
It's the network.

130
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,350
Rogelio de la Vega,

131
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,570
EP and costar.

132
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,870
[gasps]

133
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,350
Okay, okay. Thank you.
You won't regret this.

134
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,830
Bye.

135
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,530
They love the pilot.

136
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,450
They're ordering
This Is Marsto series.

137
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,450
We did it. We did it. [gasps]

138
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,450
We have it all!Not really.

139
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,580
Like you said,

140
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,500
family is everything.

141
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,760
My daughter still hates me.

142
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,200
Oh, it'll work itself out.
Here, have a cupcake.

143
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,810
We're going to series.

144
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,850
You're giving birth to a show,
and this baby will...

145
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,680
[singsongy]:
definitely love you back!

146
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,120
PETRA:
This is my baby.

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,210
I need the pop-up
to go perfectly.

148
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,820
It will. The event
is already sold out.

149
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,780
Tons of press are
confirmed to attend.

150
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,480
You've obsessed over
every detail, including how much

151
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,610
cologne I'm allowed to wear.

152
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,780
Which we agreed
is zero, correct?

153
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,920
I can't have anything
interfering with Ludo's food.

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,790
Come on. Why are you so nervous?

155
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,700
Because...

156
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,970
Clarissa James is coming.

157
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,400
Ooh.

158
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,320
Is it someone you're seeing?

159
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,150
Come on, spill it.
I want to know everything.

160
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,800
Okay, stand down,
girlfriend.

161
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,450
No. She's an investor.

162
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,460
Who specializes in
hotel franchising.

163
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,240
As in franchising the Marbella?

164
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,410
I had no idea

165
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,940
you were even
thinking about that.

166
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,420
Not thinking about it.
Dreaming about it.

167
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,550
I want a Marbella
in every major city.

168
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,770
On every continent.

169
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,680
Does that
sound insane?Yes.

170
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,560
But if anyone can pull it off...

171
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,900
I know. It's me, right?

172
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,510
[laughs] I hadn't even
put out feelers yet.

173
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Clarissa just got in touch
out of the blue.

174
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,430
Oh, I'm so excited, I don't
know how I'll sleep tonight.

175
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,430
[exhales]

176
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,790
[sighs]

177
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,620
Jane.
Hmm?

178
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,360
Are you okay?

179
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,840
Yeah.

180
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,540
My-my mom wants
to start

181
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,060
our dance lessons
for the wedding.

182
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,720
Dance lessons?

183
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,980
That's what's got you
tossing and turning?

184
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,550
Come on, what is it?

185
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,460
M-My agent...

186
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,550
was giving me notes
on the crime in my novel,

187
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,690
and... she said
something crazy.

188
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,900
[scoffs] And I can't
get it out of my head

189
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,040
even though
I know it's crazy.

190
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,470
Okay.

191
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,610
Well, what
did she say?

192
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,560
That Rose might have
swapped Mateo

193
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,480
for another baby
when she kidnapped him.

194
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,920
Oh, my God.

195
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,490
Oh, my God!
Wait a second,

196
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,270
you're supposed to be
telling me that I'm crazy.

197
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,490
I-I'm sorry,
but it-it's just Rose.

198
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,280
She's capable of anything.

199
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,630
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, great. Now I can't sleep.

200
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,760
So you actually think
it's possible that Mateo

201
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,550
was switched at birth?
No.

202
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,070
I-I just mean,
it's not...

203
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,770
impossible.

204
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,600
Oh, my God.But wait. But wait. Okay.

205
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,900
Let's-let's just
think this through

206
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,900
before we both
freak out.
Too late.

207
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,300
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Agreed. Come on.

208
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,130
Rose has a reason
for everything.

209
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,910
Right? So there was
no motivation for her

210
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,520
to switch out Mateo.

211
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,570
She was only interested
in one thing at the time.

212
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,220
The brooch. Right.

213
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,000
Which she got.

214
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,530
So it doesn't make
any sense for her

215
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,400
to give us back a baby
that wasn't ours.

216
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,920
That's true.
That's a really good point.

217
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,270
And that right there.

218
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,530
Okay? That crinkle.

219
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,360
In your forehead.
Mateo has that same

220
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,840
exact crinkle in the same
place when he frowns.

221
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,930
That's true.
And do you
remember when we

222
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,410
put my baby pictures side
by side next to Mateo's?

223
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,500
You were twins.

224
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,590
Right?
Right.

225
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,980
So, rationally,
there's no way

226
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,720
Mateo isn't our son.

227
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,070
Your agent was just giving
you an idea for your book.

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,550
It's not real.
End of story.

229
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,080
In fact, ask me again.

230
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,560
So, my agent
said maybe...
That's crazy.

231
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,520
[both chuckle]

232
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,960
Okay. I feel better.

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,170
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I don't, honestly.

234
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,390
Hey, Raf.

235
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,960
And now neither does he.

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,830
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling security.

237
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,400
Oh, no, I am leaving. For good.

238
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,190
I came to say goodbye.

239
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,620
Didn't we just do this?

240
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,190
Well, no, then I was just

241
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,670
going to an ashram
for two weeks.

242
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,710
This is a more...
permanent goodbye.

243
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,500
So goodbye.

244
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,890
Permanently.

245
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,110
Goodbye.

246
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,120
[papers thud]

247
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,200
I heard you're getting married.

248
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,730
I'm so happy for you

249
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,730
and Jane, and I'm
really sorry for everything.

250
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,340
I really am.

251
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,390
I love you, Rafael.

252
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,520
Well, maybe that would have
meant something

253
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,130
if you weren't involved
with a criminal.

254
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,230
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of crime...

255
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,590
[tapping keys]

256
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
PETRA:
I can't believe it.

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,610
I-I've been a fan of you and
your hotel since I started.

258
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,050
The first time
I slid into a set

259
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,530
of Marcienne hotel sheets,

260
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,620
I think I wept a
little. [chuckles]

261
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,360
Oh. Well, I only
invest in the best.

262
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,360
Which is why I am honored you're
interested in helping me expand.

263
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,280
Well, actually,
it was my guru who suggested

264
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,020
that I take a look
at the Marbella.

265
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,540
Uh...

266
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,630
Well, hey, whoever this guru
is, she sounds really smart.

267
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
[laughs] I love
her already.

268
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,290
Oh, good.
Well, she's actually here.

269
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,470
I take her everywhere.

270
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,210
She helps me make
all my decisions.

271
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,650
Maggie? Come on in.

272
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,170
Shalom. So very nice
to meet you.

273
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,260
Petra, is it?

274
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,610
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Let the good times roll.

275
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,700
I'm supposed to meet someone
here, uh... Jane Villanueva?

276
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,530
Oh, uh, hi.
That's me.

277
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,620
Stop reading and say hello.

278
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,850
Are you my real mommy?

279
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,810
JANE:
I can't live
with this uncertainty.

280
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,420
I looked it up,
and it might just be

281
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,120
a temporary skin
discoloration from labor,

282
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,250
but it could also
be a birthmark,

283
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,600
and Mateo doesn't
have a birthmark.

284
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,130
So, you want a DNA test?

285
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,220
No. I don't want one,
but we have to get one.

286
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,610
Rose had no motive
to swap Mateo.

287
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,180
She's a sociopath,
Rafael.

288
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,260
There is no rationalizing
her motives.

289
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,220
You know it's possible.

290
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,790
But it's-it's not probable.

291
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,100
And I wish I could
live with that.

292
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,060
But I can't.

293
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,710
Okay. [sighs]

294
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,280
Okay.
So we'll-we'll do the test.

295
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,720
Okay.

296
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,290
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, friends, we last left

297
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,640
our Jane on
a fact-finding mission.

298
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,250
Okay, Mr. Sweetface,
we just have to

299
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,470
swab your cheek really quickly.

300
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,250
Why?It's just a little test

301
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,990
to make sure you're getting
enough vitamins in the morning.

302
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,820
Okay.

303
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,650
That's it?

304
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,660
That's it. Easy.

305
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,310
Don't worry.

306
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,100
It's gonna be fine.

307
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,140
[cell phone chimes]

308
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,450
Okay.
Well, I'd better get to work.

309
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,850
Help Petra with...

310
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,850
Maggie.

311
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,020
What do you want?

312
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,850
To help you,
dear daughter.

313
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,420
I met Clarissa
in rehab.

314
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,810
Ugh, it was very boring,
so I watch a lot of Netflix.

315
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,820
There was this documentary,
Wild Wild Country...

316
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,820
Get to the point.

317
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,040
I become
Clarissa's guru.

318
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,260
And then I give
her Marbella idea.

319
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,740
You are welcome.

320
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,610
Now I want half of hotel.

321
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,870
I'm not negotiating.

322
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,700
You should.
Why?

323
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,700
You don't have
a leg to stand on.

324
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,700
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Low blow, Petra. MAGDA: Okay.

325
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,360
I just tell Clarissa
this hotel has bad juju,

326
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,710
and we will be on our way.

327
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,060
$500 a month
for you to leave the country

328
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,930
and never set foot
in the United States again.

329
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,670
That is nothing compared
to what I am giving you.

330
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,330
$5,000 a month.
Final offer.

331
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,290
Well, my final offer is:
I want half of hotel.

332
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,340
Without me,
you have no Clarissa.

333
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,820
ROGELIO:
This can't be happening.

334
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,170
We have a meeting
with the network in one hour.

335
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,560
Why are you not ready?

336
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,650
Are you sick?
Is it terminal?

337
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,740
Do you think you could make it
five to seven more years?

338
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,090
I'm just getting an infusion
of B12 and C concentrates.

339
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,090
There's nothing wrong
with her body.

340
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,660
This is about her soul.

341
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,620
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh. Is that all?

342
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,750
I realized you were right.

343
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,320
Success means nothing
without the love and support

344
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,760
of my daughter.

345
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,890
And that will come. For sure.

346
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,890
But in the meantime,
we just got a show picked up.

347
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,890
By a major network.

348
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,680
Love and support that.

349
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,640
I can't. You see,

350
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,420
I had built up this wall
over the years,

351
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:30,080
and I've been able to keep
these huge emotions at bay.

352
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,960
But you, Rogelio, you
tore down that wall.

353
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,960
And now... [sighs]
I'm just overcome

354
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,870
with this painful,

355
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,090
all-consuming emptiness.

356
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,360
Well, then let's rebuild
that wall.

357
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,750
We can do it together
brick by brick.

358
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,580
There's no going back.

359
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,840
This river's dam has burst.

360
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,020
Right now, all I
can do is get back

361
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,500
into intensive psychotherapy.

362
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,940
And who knows?

363
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,940
Maybe the fact that
I'm turning down the chance

364
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,590
for a big successful hit show

365
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,860
and the millions of
dollars that come with it

366
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,120
will impress Pond.

367
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,820
What are you talking about?

368
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,340
I'm sorry, Rogelio.

369
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,300
I can't accept the pickup.

370
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,000
XIOMARA:
Calm down, Rogelio.

371
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,350
Inhala, exhala.

372
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,570
You can fix this.

373
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,870
You just need
to talk to Pond.

374
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,700
You can get
through to her.

375
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,180
You're the daughter
whisperer.

376
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,920
Bye.

377
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,230
If now is not a good
time, we can come back.

378
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,360
No. Rogelio's good, and your
wedding dance has to be great.

379
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,360
Besides, this is
the perfect way to keep me

380
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,020
from stressing about
my first day of nursing school.

381
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,370
Just three days away.What did I just say?

382
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,370
Are you trying to kill me?Sorry. Sorry.

383
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,720
[phone alarm blares]Ah. Oops. [chuckles]

384
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,990
All right, let's dance.
You guys watch the video?

385
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,860
We did.Yep.

386
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
[music playing]

387
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,000
Mateo's ours.
Don't worry.

388
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,960
He is, right?Yes.

389
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,480
[music stops]

390
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,960
You guys are a little stiff.

391
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,880
I...

392
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,840
Sorry, we're both just
stressed about work.

393
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,100
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And the results of
a certain DNA test.

394
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,540
Come on, Ma.
Let's show them how it's done.

395

Abuela.

397
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
Who knew you could
move your hips like that.

398
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,720
RAFAEL:
Oh, Alba's got moves.
I read all about Pablo

399
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,380
in Jane's book.

400
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:38,080
Uh... well, yeah.[music stops]

401
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,130
I mean... yeah.

402
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,840
[exhales] But when you read
the beginning of my book,

403
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,660
about Venezuela,
you were fine with it.

404
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,890
You didn't think my book
was going anywhere?

405
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,500
Oh, this is about Jorge?

406
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,030
You brought him up.Okay, why doesn't everybody
just take a breath.

407
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,560
I'm sure we can
find a solution.

408
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,130
What?! But...

409
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,480
I drove you here.

410
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,790
[cell phone ringing]

411
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,050
Mom, you're calling me.

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, we last left our Jane

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,900
Look at you two!XIOMARA:
I found the perfect partner

416
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,080
to help me finish choreographing
your wedding dance.

417
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,040
Show Mommy your twirl.

418
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,730
Bravo, Mr. Sweetface.

419
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,700
Thank you so much
for watching him today.Of course.

420
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,040
How's the writing going?

421
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,260
I mean, I'm taking out
the central theme,

422
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,310
so not much makes sense in the
book anymore, but, you know...

423
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm sorry, hon.

424
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,140
Ah, it's okay.
I'm just frustrated.

425
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,930
I was already struggling
with notes from my agent.

426
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,490
Didn't know
I was gonna have to deal

427
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,100
with notes from my abuela,too.
[chuckles]

428
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,930
You know what?

429
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,150
Send the book to me.

430
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,540
I'll give it to her.

431
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,020
Trust me,
she'll feel differently

432
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,540
when she actually reads it.

433
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,500
ROGELIO:
What are you reading?

434
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,720
What are you doing here?

435
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,030
This is my favorite...
coffee shop

436
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,730
slash, uh,
computer place

437
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,690
slash eatery.
[chuckles]

438
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,950
So hip.

439
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay, fine.
I tracked you down

440
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,610
because your mom
is really hurting.

441
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,000
Don't you think it might
be time to forgive her?

442
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,180
No.

443
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,350
Let me paint you
a painful little picture.

444
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
It's 2004, the year
my mother won

445
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,970
her Emmy for that HBO movie,
Plath on Plath:

446
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,490
The Sylvia Plath Story.

447
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,800
"As told by the ghost
of Sylvia Plath."

448
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,890
Of course. She slayed.

449
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,060
I'm sorry. Please continue.

450
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,020
So, it's the night
of the Emmys.

451
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,460
My three best friends
are sleeping over

452
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,850
so we can all watch.

453
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,460
I was so excited and proud,

454
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,850
because wow,
my mom was just so cool.

455
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,860
And then she wins.

456
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,380
And there's my mom
accepting her Emmy on live TV

457
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,080
in front of millions
of people.

458
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,210
And then...

459
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,910
You know what?

460
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,090
Let me just show you.
[chuckles]

461
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,390
RIVER [laughs]:
Wow.

462
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,870
Oh! What an honor.

463
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,490
Um, oh, there are
so many people to thank.

464
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,180
Everybody at HBO.

465
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,490
Our writers.

466
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,620
The cast. Our amazing crew.

467
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,100
Ah, my dog walkers,
Yuri and Marigold.

468
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,240
Bless.
[chuckles]

469
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
My, uh, my-my acupuncturist,

470
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,720
Dr. Mishka. Genius.

471
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,070
And finally...
[takes deep breath]

472
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,990
I want to thank the most
important person in my life.

473
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,770
The person who inspires me
every day to be...

474
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,430
the best person
I can possibly be...

475
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,950
my agent, Don Sherwood.

476
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,000
I love you, Don.
[laughs]

477
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,870
Oh, God, I can't believe
I almost forgot.

478
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,570
Um, sweetheart...

479
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,260
I love you so much.

480
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,270
This is nothing without you.
[takes deep breath]

481
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,230
Carrie, my publicist.

482
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,750
I love you,
I love you, love you.

483
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,100
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oof. That was bad on bad.

484
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,100
Worst night of my life,

485
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,190
and nothing she does
will ever change that.

486
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,460
Understand?

487
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,760
ROGELIO:
Of course I understand,

488
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,760
but now my dream show is dying,

489
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,330
and there's no help
in sight. I'm doomed.

ready for some dancing?

493
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,610
ALBA:
Jane.

494
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,530
And what did you think?

495
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,970
Abuela, it's fiction.

496
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,940
Ma, you have to understand
how hard

497
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,420
Jane has worked on this book.

498
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,420
If you make her take out more,
the rest will fall apart.

499
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,310
It's okay, Abuela.
I understand. It's your story.

500
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,050
You have the right to decide

501
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,790
if it gets told.

502
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,320
I'll rewrite the book.
No problem.

503
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,670
A rewrite. Of course.

504
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,070
Oh, sorry. Uh, carry on.

505
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,370
I just realized that a rewrite

506
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,980
could solve
all my problems, too.

507
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,510
But you two, keep fighting.

508
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,900

Uh,

509
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,950
we're not fighting.

510
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,250
Everything's okay.

511
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,730
And by "okay," I mean that I
have to do a huge rewrite now

512
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,430
and...

513
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,480
Uh, hey, Mr. Sweetface, uh,
want to go to your room

514
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,530
and color, yeah? Okay.

515
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,660
The DNA results?

516
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,670
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Before she opens it,

517
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,410
I will remind you
this is a telenovela,

518
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,460
so the unexpected
is to be expected.

519
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,330

Oh...

522
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,390
Oh, I'm so relieved.

523
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,960
I know.

524
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,360
But this is it, right?

525
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,190
Because getting a DNA test
for our son is just too much.

526
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,230
You're right. I am gonna
separate fact from fiction

527
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,020
and get over this fear.

528
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,540

529
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,200
she was trying to do.

530
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,640
Also trying hard...

531
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,120
As you can see,
our guests feel transported

532
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,820
from the moment
they enter the hotel.

533
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,300
MAGDA: They would
feel more transported

534
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,300
if the drinks
were stronger.

535
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,470
This tastes like
virgin smoothie.

536
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,210
Well, people do
like alcohol

537
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,390
on holiday.

538
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,130
Noted.

539
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,700
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes. Let me remind you,

540
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,790
these two have a wild,
wild history.

541
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,540
PETRA:
You should get back
to work now, Alba.

542
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,280
Now, if you'll follow me
up to this platform,

543
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,580
Clarissa, you can
actually see

544
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,670
a view of the ocean
from our lobby.
Ooh!

545
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,670
I can't get up.A shame.

546
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,150
So here's what
I'm thinking.

547
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,500
The pop-up attracts
the adults, okay?

548
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,160
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
All right, things are
looking good here.

549
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,860
Not as good here.

550
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,160
What's going on, hon?

551
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,250
Did Jorge call you? Shoot.

552
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,080
I came here for
a change of scenery,

553
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,690
and because
I wrote most

554
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,610
of my book here,
I thought I might get inspired.

555
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,220
Well, let me talk
to Abuela again

556
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,700
and see if she'll
change her mind.

557
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,220
No, don't. It's her life.

558
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,050
Besides, I can concentrate
on this instead of the crime

559
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,010
which is driving me nuts
and making me do things

560
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,570
like get a DNA test for Mateo.

561
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,180
What?

562
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,490
I got it in my head
that Rose switched babies.

563
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,150
Oh, sweetie.
I know.

564
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,840
She didn't,
but she could've, Mom,

565
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,670
because she's
so dangerous,

566
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,070
which is why I'm wondering
if it's even safe for me

567
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,720
to publish a book about a
mass murderer who's still alive.

568
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,510
Well, you changed details.Enough?

569
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,990
Rose could be really pissed,
and she has

570
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,330
associates outside
of prison.

571
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,810
What if she sends someone

572
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,380
to threaten me and my family,
or worse?

573
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,990
Hon, you have to get her
out of your head.

574
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,610
[sighs] I know.

575
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,780
I just don't know how.

576
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,350
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
As you'll recall, Jane was

577
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,960
struggling to separate
truth from fiction.

578
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,570
Oh! [stammers]

579
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,710
Don't worry, Abuela,
I'm doing a big rewrite.

580
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,060
I-I'm actually
thinking of

581
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,670
changing the character
to a grandfather.

582
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,060
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hmm. I'd like to see that.

583
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,110
Why are you crying,
Abuelo?

584
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,590
Pa.

585
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,460
What?

586
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,810
Did Mom talk to you?
I told her not to.

587
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,470
Then who was it?

588
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,560
[crowd cheering over TV]

589
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,780
Jorge?

590
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,610
Oh, Jane, hi.
Is the soccer game too loud?

591
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,830
[mutes TV]Oh, oh, no, no, no,
nothing like that.

592
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,440
I-I-I just wanted
to say thank you

593
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,180
for getting my abuelato change
her mind about my novel.

594
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,180
Saved you a ton of work, huh?

595
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,230
Uh, you sure did. [chuckles]

596
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,010
[TV resumes playing]

597
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,460
[mutes TV]

598
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,630
I feel like there might be
more you want to say.

599
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,110
Yeah. Sorry.

600
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,120
I was just wondering
what exactly you said to her.

601
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,820
I just helped her understand
why this was so hard for her.

602
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,430
Because of her friends
at church?

603
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,250
More than that.

604
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,560
Being undocumented for so long,

605
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,130
you get used to living
with these walls up,

606
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,650
keeping things secret.

607
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,660
And living like that,
it changes you

608
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,830
and how you relate to the world.

609
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,620
It makes you more closed off.

610
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,540
So I just reminded her that
things are different for us now,

611
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,020
which is something
we're still getting used to,

612
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,670
but we're gonna do it together.

613
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,460
Well, I'm really glad
my abuelahas you in her life.

614
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,810
I'm glad I do, too.

615
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,340
Me, too.

616
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,340
Can I put the game back on?

617
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,430
Yes, of course.

618
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,780
PETRA:
Your game's just about over.

619
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,390
I got Clarissa halfway
there without you already.

620
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,350
She wants to invest. I'm gonna
close the deal at the pop-up.

621
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,570
I can change her mind
before that.

622
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,440
Yes, but you won't.

623
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,490
Let me out!Be quiet.

624
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,660
There's some water in there
and some crackers.

625
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,800
I need a security guard
at the offices.

626
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,490
POND:
Is anybody there?

627
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,370
Why is it so dark in here?

628
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,370
Where is everybody?

629
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,980
Hello?

630
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,020
Why are you dressed like that?

631
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,460
Your e-mail said we were
doing reshoots today.

632
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,380
We are. Just not for the show.

633
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,730
Today, we are reshooting life.

634
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,470
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yes, friends, the line

635
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,730
between truth and fiction

636
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,560
is getting blurrier
by the moment.

637
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,520
I... can't believe it.I know.

638
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,650
This dress still fits me after
all these years. [chuckles]

639
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,960
I actually had to
take it in a tiny bit.

640
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,610
[clears throat]

641
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,140
[groans]

642
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,490
Oh, Pond, uh, even though I know
I can't go back in time,

643
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,710
I realize how much

644
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,970
I hurt you in the past
by not telling you

645
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,320
how important
you were to me

646
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,540
when I had
the chance,

647
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,020
so I've re-created

648
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,460
that night so I can
finally do it right.

649
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,420
Is... is that my bedroom
from middle school?

650
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,470
RIVER: Down to the very
last butterfly clip.

651
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,430
Though I'm very sorry to report
that your Tamagotchi has died.

652
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,430
I know you had a sleepover
with your friends that night,

653
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,390
so I would be so grateful
if you would oblige me

654
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,960
and put on your PJs.

655
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,350
[scoffs] This is insane.
No, I'm not doing this.

656
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,830
Really? Because, uh,

657
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,360
Jemma and Taylor
and Chartreuse

658
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
will be so
disappointed.

659
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,060
MAGDA:
Get me out of here!

660
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,410
Let me out now!

661
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,810
I have to go number two.

662
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,500
I'm under strict orders, ma'am.

663
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,770
Petra said you're
a dirty charlatan

664
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,330
and I shouldn't trust
a word you say.

665
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,590
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's fair.

666
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,340
MAGDA:
Please, I'm dying.

667
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,210
[crying]: My blood...
will be on your hands.

668
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,260
[coughing]

669
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,180
[yelps]

670
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,790
POND:
Wow.

671
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,530
I can't believe you're all here.

672
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,530
Yeah, we thought
maybe you were dying,

673
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,400
but since your mom offered to
put us up at a five-star hotel,

674
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,190
we didn't really
ask questions.

675
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,840
So... Tay Tay,

676
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,370
haven't seen you in forever.

677
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,330
Yeah, not since you
stole my boyfriend.

678
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,370
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Tay Tay was pi-pissed.

679
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,460
Jemma, you still
have braces?

680
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,590
The make-up department
forced me to put these on

681
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,420
for "maximum authenticity."
They really hurt.

682
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,990
ROGELIO [on TV]:
Gracias.

683
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,000
All art is sacred and fleeting,

684
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,960
so when an actress
steps into a role,

685
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,040
she's transformed,

686
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,220
however briefly, into...

687
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,440
Anyway, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

688
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,440
And the winner

689

690
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,230
in a Limited Series is...
River Fields.

691
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,410
Oh! [laughs]

692
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,410
RIVER:
Thank you.

693
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,980
You know, I-I don't think
that I would've been prepared

694
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,980
for my starring role
in Plath on Plathhad I not had

695
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,900
a very special person
in my life.

696
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,560
My daughter, Pond.

697
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,520
You know, they say that, um,
a pond needs a river

698
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,040
to sustain it...

699
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,040
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
They do?

700
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,350
But I think
it's the other way around.

701
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,700
Pond, y-you fill me up.

702
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,050
You...

703
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,270
you teach me so much every day.

704
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,320
I would be nothing without you.

705
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,980
And while we can't
go back in time,

706
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,900
I can now say I'm sorry.

707
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm sorry that I wasn't there
for you all those years.

708
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,820
I thought my Emmy win
was the highlight of my life,

709
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,610
but reconnecting with you
is the real climax.

710
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,480
This is so crazy.

711
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,480
And sweet.

712
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,710
Oh...

713
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,670
GUARD:
Stop her!

714
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,550
[exhales]

715
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,590
Sakra.

716
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,080
[gasps]

717
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,640
So, we meet again.

718
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,820
What are you up to

719
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,910
this time, Magda?

720
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,600
I'm not up to anything.

721
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,690
I'm calling security.

722
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,520
I would not do that
if I were you.

723
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,700
I know people.

724
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,480
I don't want something
to happen to you again.

725
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,880
Are you threatening me?

726
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,010
It is not a threat.

727
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,060
It is a promise.

728
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,540
[laughs]

729
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,150
I do not get joke.

730
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,540
I got all that on my phone,

731
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,630
so if you don't
leave town forever,

732
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,940
you're going
back to jail.

733
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,590
Or did you forget
that threatening me

734
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,120
is a violation of your parole

735
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,600
and it comes with a mandatory
five-year sentence?

736
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,470
But I am not scared
of you anymore,

737
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,260
because I am
an American now, bitch!

738
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,610
Okay. Okay.

739
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,520
I'll leave.And remember,

740
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,530
if I ever see you around here

741
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,220
ever again,

742
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,530
I'll take this recording
straight to the police.

743
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,230
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Don't delete it, Alba.

744
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,230
OMG.

745
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,840
She finally learned
how to work her phone.

746
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,060
[exhales]

747
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,410
Not working as well...

748
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,630
[groaning]

749
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,240
Our Jane.

750
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,510
Thank you, Abuela. I'm trying
to crack this crime story.

751
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,080
I even prayed about it.

752
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,820
What?

753
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,180
You confronted Magda?

754
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,580
And just like that,
Jane realized

755
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,410
what she needed to do
in her novel,

756
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,720
a way for the crime to climax.

757
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,110
A confrontation. That's it.

758
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,200
Yes. I don't need
to build up the crime.

759
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,980
I need to build up the heroine.

760
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,770
Mm... mwah!

761
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,640
Wow, looks like somebody
had a breakthrough.

762
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,730
A big one, yes.

763
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,340
And I wrote it,
and it feels right

764
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,600
for the book,

765
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,690
and now I think
I need to do it, too.

766
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,990
Do what, too?

767
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,650
Confront Rose.

768
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,960
I want to go see her.

769
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,140
I think I changed my mind.

770
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,750
Oh, good.

771
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,540
I wasn't sure seeing Rose in
person was a good idea anyway.

772
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,930
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, thank God. Me, neither.

773
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,540
I meant I changed my mind
about the dress.

774
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,800
I think I'd feel
more comfortable

775
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,500
confronting Rose in pants.

776
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,540
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh.

777
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,150
Got it. Good choice.No.

778
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,160
Wh-What do you mean you're not
sure it's a great idea?

779
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,550
And why didn't you say anything
last night?

780
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,380
I-I... I'm just worried
that seeing her in person

781
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,420
might upset you even more.

782
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,080
But I was just trying
to be supportive,

783
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,170
and you were so determined.

784
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,300
I am determined, because I can't

785
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,520
keep letting Rose have
this power over me.

786
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,090
If I can just see her behind
bars and say my piece to her,

787
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,310
I really think
I'll be able to move on.

788
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,310
I need to do this.

789
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,310
I just need to do this in pants.

790
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,190
MAGDA:
Okay.

791
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,840
Okay.

792
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,230
I accept your deal.

793
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,760
5,000 a month.

794
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,190
Oh, Mother, you escaped.

795
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,110
Good for you.
But you're too late.

796
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,850
I closed the deal
with Clarissa last night.

797
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,810
So your stock is
bottoming out.

798
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,420
I'll give you
500 a month

799
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,330
to leave and never come back.

800
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,900
500 a...

801
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,340
Uh, very generous.

802
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,690
I will take it.

803
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,650
I leave town tonight.

804
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,700
Where will you go?

805
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,570
To live with your other twin.

806
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,400
The triplet.

807
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,530
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wait. Truth or fiction?

808
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,270
Don't try to get
in my head, Mother.

809
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,190
Get out of here.

810
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,290
XIOMARA:
What a day.

811
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,110
I don't know
what I was nervous about.

812
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,460
Nursing school was great.

813
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,810
I was totally prepared
from all the reading I'd done,

814
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,250
and there were a lot
of older students like me,

815
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,690
so I didn't feel out of place.

816
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,990
I love seeing you
so happy, Xiomara.

817
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,300
I am.[both laugh]

818
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,300
[phone ringing]

819
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,350
Ah. River!

820
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:07,090
How is my talented
costar slash super-mother?

821
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,570
Ah, I can't
thank you enough, Rogelio.

822
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,610
You truly are
the daughter whisperer.

823
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,230
Oh, stop.

824
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,790
I just did
what any caring, handsome

825
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,400
and extremely brilliant person
would do.

826
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,410
Well,

827
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,670
thanks to you, Pond and I have
really turned things around.

828
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,450
I'm so happy for you.

829
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,330
Does this mean
that the show is back on?

830
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,890
It absolutely is.

831
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,370
Oh, thank God.

832
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,850
But we're moving it to New York.

833
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,860
Wait, what?

834
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,080
Pond really wants to move
back home, and like you said,

835
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,690
I have to put family first.

836
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,300
And luckily,

837
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,260
my contract says I can move
the show wherever I want,

838
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,820
and I want this.

839
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,430
For my family.

840
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:53,090
But, uh, what about my family?

841
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,310
I-I know it's going to be
a tough decision for you.

842
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,530
[sighs]
I'd hate to recast.

843
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,540
I'm so nervous.

844
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,330
I know.

845
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,810
But you can do this.
And...

846
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,420
if you change your mind,
that's okay, too.

847
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,640
We can turn around,
separate life from art.

848
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,420
I can't.

849
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,040
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
It's hard, for the record,

850
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,340
to keep them from colliding. [tires screeching]

851
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,340
Whoa.

852
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,000
What the hell?

853
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,650
Which brings us to our climax.

854
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,660
Guard, uh, there's something
in here I think you should see.

855
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,790
And what is all too real,
relatively.

856
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,230
I think you should
probably call this in.

857
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,450
I seem to be losing
a lot of blood.

858
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,580
Hurry up and grab your bag.

859
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,890
Now?

you doing here?

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,910
What's going on?

873
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,430
I'm afraid you can't see her.

874
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,960
What? Why?

875
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,650

Rose escaped.

Luisa.

Finally.

879
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,620
Rose escaped?
But we knew

880
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,060
she was gonna try
because of Luisa.

881
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,060

Of course

882
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,280
she was involved.

No, it's not what you think.

884
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,540
We're gonna spend the rest
of our lives together, baby,

885
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:25,200
somewhere where no one
can ever find us.

886
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,470
You're under arrest.DENNIS:
Luisa's actually

887
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,640
been working with us
for months.

888
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,080
Luisa betrayed me?

889
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,470
I had no idea. I swear.

890
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,910
OFFICER: Police!DENNIS: Because of Luisa,

891
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,080
we were able to uncover
Rose's escape plan,

892
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,560
cut off her supply of funds

893
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,180
and send in the team
to capture her.

894
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,220
She couldn't tell you the truth
for your own safety.

895
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,270
So you guys caught her, and
she'll be back in prison.

896
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,490
Unfortunately, things didn't

897
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,750
go as planned.

898
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,360
Sorry.

899
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,850

900
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,160
DENNIS:
And she escaped again.

901
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,590
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know.

902
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,030
Talk about scary stuff.
