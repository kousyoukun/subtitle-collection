00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,150
<i>Friends, we're almost at the end.</i>

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,050
<i> And our Jane was approaching</i>
<i> the finish line as well.</i>

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,320
<i> That's right,</i>
<i> she had finished her novel.</i>

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,990
<i> You know, the one</i>
<i> based on her life.</i>

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,940
<i> Oh, and she got herself</i>
<i> an agent.</i>

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,890
Yes!
<i> And in more good news...</i>

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,330
<i> Rogelio's pilot</i> This Is Mars
<i> got picked up to series.</i>

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,450
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> River Fields decided</i>

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,830
<i> to move the show to New York.</i>
For my family.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,330
What about my family?

11
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,070
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> And speaking of giant moves,</i>

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,120
<i> Rafael started working</i>
<i> for Petra,</i>

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,960
<i> and Petra was determined</i>
<i> to expand the Marbella.</i>

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,960
I want a Marbella in every
major city, on every continent.

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,850
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Might as well dream big, right?</i>

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,130
<i> But not everything was dreamy.</i>
<i> Remember our evil villain Rose?</i>

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,470
<i> The one who kidnapped Mateo</i>
<i> and gave Michael amnesia?</i>

18
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,590
<i> Well, Jane was determined to</i>
<i> confront her once and for all.</i>

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,470
If I can just say
my piece to her,

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,970
I really think
I'll be able to move on.

21
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,310
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Only problem...</i>

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,140
(tires screeching)

23
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,400
Run!
DENNIS:<i> Because of Luisa,</i>

24
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,900
<i> we were able to uncover Rose's</i>

<i> escape plan and send in a team</i>
<i> to capture her.</i>

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,570
You're under arrest.

27
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,770
Luisa betrayed me?
Police!

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,540
DENNIS:<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> things didn't go as planned,</i>

29
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,910
and she escaped again.

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,660
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Which, I'm afraid,</i>

31
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,110
<i> is where we left off.</i>

32
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,250
<i> Friends, after our</i>
<i> Jane Gloriana Villanueva</i>

33
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,550
<i> heard the news...</i>

34
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,880
Rose escaped.

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,620
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Well, everything changed.</i>

36
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,950
We don't know
where she is,

37
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,340
but Luisa's on her way
to a safe house in Belize.

38
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,130
We feel certain she will
try to contact her.

39
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,680
So my sister is bait?
Oh, she insisted.

40
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,770
She wanted to keep Rose away
from you and your family.

41
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,270
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> And, well, from that moment on,</i>

42
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,740
<i> our Jane was living</i>
<i> in a constant state of anxiety,</i>

43
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,110
<i> so her family stepped in</i>
<i> to help her cope.</i>

44
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,810
BOTH:
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

45
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,700
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> But despite their best efforts,</i>

46
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,320
<i> our Jane remained traumatized.</i>

47
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,650
(exhales)

48
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,420
(screams)

49
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,420
<i> Always on edge.</i>

50
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,490
<i> Afraid of what was lurking</i>
<i> around the corners,</i>

51
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,210
<i> in the shadows.</i>

52
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,470
Yeah, it was the
air conditioner.

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,600
I checked, no one
is outside.

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,340
Are you okay?

55
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,940
No. I hate
living like this.

56
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,140
I know.

57
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,650
Maybe it's time for you
to get professional help.

58
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,240
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<i> But</i>
<i> after talking and talking...</i>

59
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,650
I just can't talk anymore.

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,160
I know, logically,
Rose isn't coming,

61
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,740
but I can't shake this
feeling that there's

62
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,360
something horrible
just around the corner.

63
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,200
Which is no way to live.
Exactly.

64
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,530
And I need to figure out
how to manage my anxiety.

65
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,340
I think maybe
you should try tapping.

66
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,500
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> I don't think tap dancing</i>

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,840
<i> is going to solve this problem.</i>

68
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,180
One of the branches of therapy
I offer is EFT.

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,350
It's a self-soothing tool,
based in acupuncture.

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,480
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<i> Well,</i>
<i> that makes much more sense.</i>

71
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,320
Every time you feel anxious,

72
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,770
just tap along these meridians.

73
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,830
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Which brings us here.</i>

74
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,280
Is it working?
A little.

75
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,370
Maybe? I have to remember
the tapping pattern,

76
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,840
so that at least takes my mind
off of Rose. How was your day?

77
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,290
Ugh, stressful.

78
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,290
Petra keeps calling,
e-mailing and texting me

79
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,630
every two seconds.

80
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,630
She even had me paged
at the gym.

81
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,750
I can hardly use the
bathroom without her...

82
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,750
(ringtone playing)

83
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,970
Relax, it's my phone.

84
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,300
Maybe you should
start tapping.

85
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,390
Ooh, it's my agent.

86
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,890
(chuckles)
You love saying that.

87
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,140
I really do.

88
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,090
I should talk to my agent.

89
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,980
Hey, Lily.

90
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,930
Okay, Jane, listen, I have news.

91
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,200
Okay.

92
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,650
Good news or bad news?

93
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,900
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> In case you forgot,</i>

94
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,990
<i> Jane is not a fan</i>
<i> of unexpected news.</i>

95
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,320
Oh, sorry. Sometimes I forget
how anxious you writers are.

96
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,990
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Especially a writer</i>
<i> whose villain</i>

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,410
<i> just broke out of prison.</i>

98
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,000
It's good news.
Publishers are loving your book.

99
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,380
Oh, my God, really?

100
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,580
Really.

101
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,880
A couple editors
want to meet you,

102
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,950
so I'm setting some lunches.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,250
Lunches?
Okay, sounds good.

104
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,670
Sure does.

105
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,560
I think you're gonna get
a good offer, Jane.

106
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,630
Wow.

107
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,960
That's great. Thank you.

108
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,630
Yes, talk to
you soon. Bye.

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,070
People like my book, and she
thinks I'm gonna get an offer.

110
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,270
A good one, she said.
What does that mean?

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,520
I don't know! I mean,
I would be happy with 25,000,

112
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,570
you know?
Thrilled with 50.

113
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,810
100 would be... too crazy.

114
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,700
I'd never get that, but can you
imagine if I got $50,000?

115
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,700
Oh, and guess what else.
They want to take me to lunches.

116
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,250
Multiple, fancy,

117
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,540
free lunches! Ooh!

118
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,630
(cash register dings)

119
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,550
So, I have
some good news.

120
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,470
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Oh, looks like Jane</i>
<i> already called her mom.</i>

121
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,890
What's going on?

122
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,510
I got into a nursing program
in New York,

123
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,840
so we can move there,

124
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,180
if we decide to.

125
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,180
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Oh, different news.</i>

126
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,280
That's great.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<i> Is it?</i>

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,620
<i> I'm mixed on this whole</i>

128
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,180
<i> Ro-and-Xo-move-to-New-York</i>
<i> thing.</i>

129
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,570
I'm just so mixed
on this whole

130
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,020
move-to-New-York thing.

131
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,160
I know, but at least
one roadblock is removed.

132
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,660
Hmm.
(phone chimes)

133
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,470
Aw.
Mm. (laughs)

134
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,970
So, should we talk
to Jane about it yet?

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,970
No. She has enough on her mind
with all the Rose trauma.

136
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,210
I-I don't want to get
into it until we know

137
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,040
if Darci and Esteban are even
willing to move with Baby.

138
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,180
Then we'll know
if we're actually going.

139
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,350
Okay.

140
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,850
Maybe we should try, uh,
Jane's tapping technique.

141
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,350
(footsteps approaching)

142
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,990
Oh, good. You're here.

143
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,220
How was the open house?
Well, there were two clients

144
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,860
that wouldn't really
leave even though they...
That was a courtesy question.

145
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,080
I don't care. Look, Clarissa
and her financial group

146
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,560
love this property
for our first franchise.

147
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,370
The building needs
to be razed,

148
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,000
but what about that view?!

149
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,370
We should go see it ASAP.
When can you travel?
Oh.

150
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,570
Petra, I... I can't, you know,
with Rose out there, and...

151
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,760
Oh. Yeah. No, I get it. I'll go.

152
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,410
Y-You can make
the time up later.

153
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,930
Obviously, there are
so many international hurdles

154
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,850
we'll have to deal with
since it's a British

155
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,850
overseas property,
but we'll chip away at them.

156
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,600
Hopefully, we can close
the deal in 12 months.

157
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,090
Yeah. That sounds great.

158
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,390
You seem overwhelmed.

159
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,780
I am... a little.

160
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
Well... I get it.

161
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,430
You're working two jobs.

162
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,260
I know we had our worries
about working together,

163
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,030
but things have been going
really well between us.

164
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:36,270
So why don't we fully commit
to this partnership? Hmm?

165
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,740
Quit your real estate
agent thing.

166
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,460
Let's go all in.

167
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,750
JANE:
<i> What did you say?</i>

168
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,950
I said, "That makes sense."

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,050
The thing is, I'm
torn about quitting.
Why?

170
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,800
There'll be a lot
of stress and travel

171
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,420
and risk involved
with no guaranteed payoff.

172
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,140
I mean, I could
spend years

173
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,390
negotiating the new franchise,

174
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,960
and then nothing
could come of it.

175
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,590
Well, you can't
live in fear

176
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,460
of what's coming
around the corner.

177
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,960
Huh. Well, it looks like

178
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,980
somebody's learned a
thing or two in therapy.

179
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,430
This is your dream.

180
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,150
Go for it. Be brave.

181
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,520
Hey, that's my line.

182
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,940
Well, it's works, and it's true.

183
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,080
Look who's getting
a free lunch tomorrow.

184
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,740
I am so proud of you.

185
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,650
(laughs)
You're gonna kill it.

186
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,250
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Ah, friends, look at Jane,</i>
<i> ready to kill it,</i>

187
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,790
<i> and by "it,"</i>
<i> I mean that free lunch.</i>
(cell phone buzzing)

188
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,820
Hey, Lily, uh,
I just got to the restaurant.

189
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,260
Oh, wait. I meant to ask you.

190
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,960
Should I order
a glass of wine at lunch,

191
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,340
or is that inappropriate?

192
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,790
Jane, the editor's not coming.

193
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,350
What? Why?

194
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,460
We have a problem.

195
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,600
Uh, what is it? (laughs)

196
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,440
Michael Cordero never
signed away his life rights.

197
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,500
Without his permission,
the book can't be published.

198
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Yup.</i>

199
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,460
<i> There's always something</i>
<i> unexpected around the corner.</i>

200
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,540
(sighs)

201
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,610
Michael?
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<i> Yeah.</i>

202
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,620
<i> None of us were</i>
<i> expecting that.</i>
Yup.

203
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,220
And if he won't sign over his
life rights, there's no book.

204
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,970
Well, you have to call him
and convince him.

205
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,390
Yeah. I will.

206
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,010
So, I guess I'll just...

207
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,480
call him right now.

208
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,400
I have the number
to the ranch.

209
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,650
Rick?

210
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,470
It's the ranch foreman.

211
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,300
Um, uh, yeah, hi.

212
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,190
I-I'm looking for
Michael-- or Jason.

213
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,660
Michael-Jason.

214
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,980
Oh. Really?

215
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,200
Okay. Thank you.

216
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,700
So, I guess Michael
took off a few days ago.

217
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,830
Rick suggested I try
calling his mom.

218
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,840
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Can't the guy just get</i>
<i> a freaking cell phone?</i>

219
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,710
So I'll just... call her now.

220
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Voice mail.
Hmm.

221
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,050
Hi, Patricia. It's Jane.

222
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,330
Uh, can you please
give me a call back

223
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,680
when you have a chance?

224
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,170
Thank you. Hope all is well.

225
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,550
Okay. So, hopefully,
she'll call back,

226
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,110
and then we'll just...
PETRA:
Rafael!

227
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,690
Sounds like
she needs you.

228
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,940
I have to get ready
for my shift anyway.

229
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,700
Krishna! Pull up the preliminary
inspection reports

230
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,950
on the Turks and Caicos property
to show Rafael.

231
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,620
What were you looking at?
Nothing.

232
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,350
I'll remind you
of the Marbella's

233
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,620
"no porn, no TMZ, no Goop"
Internet policy.

234
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,960
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Whew! I would not last there.</i>

235
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,380
<i> Is that...?</i>

236
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,460
J.R.'s mother?
I'm sorry.

237
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,300
I promise I wasn't stalking
your ex-girlfriend.

238
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,220
That would be creepy.
I just love obits.

239
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,720
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> 'Cause that's not creepy.</i>

240
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,880
Oh. I guess
J.R. will be in town.

241
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,570
You okay?

242
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,990
Yeah. fine.

243
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,520
Krishna, let's see
those reports.

244
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,910
What's this?
ROGELIO:
All the reasons why

245
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,030
moving to New York would be
incredible for you and Baby.

246
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,250
God, you're a slow reader.
Let me just tell you.

247
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,900
Did you know that New York
has the most single people

248
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,920
per capita
in the entire country?

249
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,920
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Ooh.</i> I<i> should move there.</i>

250
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,840
And that single women outnumber
single men almost two to one?

251
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,430
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Never mind.</i>

252
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,080
Those lonely souls need you
and your matchmaking skills.

253
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,600
Oh...
Also, New York has
the best pizza in the world!

254
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,800
Plus, everyone is rude there,
and you love being rude.

255
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,690
And have I mentioned
Alexandria Ocasio...?

256
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,690
Rogelio, stop.

257
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,110
You do remember
I'm from New York, right?

258
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,280
I would actually

259
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,600
love to move back there.

260
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,780
Really? You would?

261
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,940
But Esteban.
He loves Miami.

262
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,990
The bozo even thinks Miami
pizza's the best in the world.

263
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,960
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Yeah, Esteban.</i>

264
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,610
<i> Gonna have</i>
<i> to disagree with you.</i>

265
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,780
(ringtone playing)

266
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,000
(gasps)

267
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,470
PATRICIA (over phone):
Hi, Jane.

268
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,170
Hi, Patricia.
Thank you for calling back.

269
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,800
Uh, I didn't mean to bother you,

270
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,290
but I'm trying
to track down Michael.

271
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,620
Do you know where he is?

272
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,010
I do, actually.

273
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,790
MICHAEL (over phone):
Hi, Jane.

274
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,960
Oh, uh, Michael, hi.

275
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,470
I... I didn't know
you were in Florida.

276
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,300
Yeah. I am.

277
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,310
Uh, anyway,
I-I'm sorry to bug you,

278
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,490
but I wanted to talk to you
about my novel.

279
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,940
You probably didn't get it,

280
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,980
but my agent sent over paperwork
for you to sign.

281
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,860
Oh, I got it. I just...

282
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,310
didn't sign it. Um...

283
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,530
I wanted to talk to you
in person.

284
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,490
Which is actually
why I'm in town.

285
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,700
Uh...

286
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,990
So, what do you think?

287
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,010
You have to meet him.

288
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,850
It's your book.
I know, but...

289
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,100
He's making the effort to drive
all the way down here to see me.

290
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,390
I-I'm worried
it's not just about the book.

291
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,690
Well, I obviously don't think
it's about the book, either.

292
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,890
I think he wants
to try to win you back.

293
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,840
But I'm not worried about that.

294
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,680
Good.

295
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,530
Because I love you so much.

296
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,350
I love you, too.
(chuckles)

297
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,780
Now go get those
life rights.

298
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,400
Thank you for understanding.

299
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,620
ROGELIO:
<i> You're welcome.</i>

300
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,240
Someone just got you
a recurring role

301
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,960
on<i> This Is Mars.</i>
You are back, baby!

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,220
Biggest acting opportunity
of your life!

303
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,470
No, thanks.

304
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,250
What? Why?

305
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,090
I've decided to quit acting.

306
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,210
I've gotten really
into aromatherapy and Reiki.

307
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,880
I'm committed to
being a spiritual

308
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,230
and physical healer
of bodies and souls.

309
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,270
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Oh, so that's why he's dressed</i>
<i> like my yoga teacher.</i>

310
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,820
I have a higher
calling now.

311
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,740
I truly want to help people.

312
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,410
But why help a few scrawny
unwashed vegans

313
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,110
when you can reach millions
of normal people

314
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,730
by entertaining them?

315
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,560
I get great satisfaction

316
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,570
out of my one-on-one
interactions with my clients.

317
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,120
Esteban, please, I will have to
give up on my dream

318
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,460
if you won't move to New York,
because I cannot leave Baby.

319
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,430
I wasn't a part
of Jane's childhood,

320
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,930
and I won't make
that mistake again.

321
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,770
Wow.

322
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,920
What a tremendous gesture
of love.

323
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,350
Baby is truly
blessed to have

324
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,310
a beautiful person for a father.

325
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,640
It was a beautiful plan,
but it backfired.

326
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,610
I don't know what to do
about Esteban now.

327
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,360
He's become a completely
different person.

328
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,780
Then you have to remind him
of who he was,

329
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,950
of what inspired him
to become a telenovela actor

330
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,370
in the first place.

331
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,790
Just think,

332
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,870
what would remind you

333
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,880
of why you love acting?

334
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,970
(gasps)
Me.

335
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,340
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> And speaking of telenovelas...</i>

336
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,510
Hi, Jane.

337
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,830
It's so nice to see you.

338
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,330
And Bo.

339
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,630
Nice to see you, too.

340
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,670
Uh...

341
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,770
So, you wanted to talk
about the book in person?

342
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,190
Yeah. Um, we're not
totally okay with it.

343
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,690
You and Bo?

344
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,200
No, uh, me and my fiancée.

345

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> If he's trying</i>
<i> to win Jane back,</i>

346
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,280
<i> this is a weird way to do it.</i>

347
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,400
You're marrying Charlie?

348
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,120
But she hates you.

349
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,040
Yeah, well, not anymore.

350
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,080
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Guess it's a shotgun wedding.</i>

351
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,750
(gun fires, clicks)

352
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,250
Wow.

353
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,750
Congratulations.

354
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,250
I am so happy for you guys.

355
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,750
Thanks.

356
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,970
Now, let's talk about this book.
(thuds)

357
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,260
I read it. I don't like it.

358
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,560
Uh, okay. Why?

359
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,380
Why? 'Cause Michael's
all over the damn thing.

360
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,400
We live a quiet life.
We like our privacy.

361
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,150
And frankly, this little book
of yours seems like

362
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,900
it's gonna be
a big headache for us.

363
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,720
So I don't want Michael
signing that paperwork.

364
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,160
Please?

365
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,160
Th-This book means
so much to me,

366
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,400
and I've worked so hard
on it-- uh, for years.

367
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,660
Sorry about that.

368
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,620
You're a writer.
Write another one.

369
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,540
(exhales)

370
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,950
Michael, please?

371
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,620
This is a family decision, Jane,

372
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,760
and I support
whatever Charlie wants.

373
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,270
Well, this damn baby's
sitting on my bladder again.

374
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,800
So, I better

375
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,590
hit the commode,
as y'all like to say down here.

376
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,940
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Uh, no one says that.</i>

377
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,260
Please? Okay,
is there anything I can do?

378
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,950
Does she want
more prize chickens?

379
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,700
No. I asked.

380
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,600
Look, I-I feel real
bad, but, you know,

381
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,790
Charlie is my fiancée and
the mother of my child,

382
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,770
and if she's uncomfortable
with all this,

383
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,440
there's nothing I can do.

384
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,070
ROGELIO:
<i> I know you said no,</i>

385
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,490
but I have something
to show you

386
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,330
that might change
your mind about acting.

387
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,460
Rogelio, I have a sound
bath in ten minutes.

388
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,780
I'll be quick.

389
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,300
(dramatic music playing
over computer)

390
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,300
(clears throat)

391
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,080
They're all... me.

392
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,410
(audience oohing)

393
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,330
(cheering)

394
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,790
(steady beeping)

395
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,340
I am an incredible actor.

396
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,940
Yes! I agree.

397
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,770
And you can't throw
all this talent away.

398
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,940
I can, actually.

399
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,360
Why?

400
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,200
Because I've played every part.

401
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,200
And I stuck the landing
in all of them,

402
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,180
not just in
<i> Vault for Your Love.</i>

403
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,190
So, why keep acting?

404
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,290
What else is there?

405
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,290
Great fame in America.

406
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,380
I am about to go
to a premiere party

407
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,710
where my face will be
on every poster,

408
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,300
every wall, every tablecloth.

409
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,130
Reporters will be
taking my picture,

410
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,970
and people will be fainting
when they see me.

411
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,140
And it's going to be
the best feeling in the world!

412
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,880
Funny. I-I can't even imagine
what that feels like.

413
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,560
(gasps)
Which must mean
I've moved on.

414
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,270
JANE:
<i> Okay, well,</i>
<i> here's another idea.</i>

415
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,720
You go through the book,
and any details

416
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,250
you're not comfortable with,
I'll take out.

417
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,090
Well, I'm pretty sure
Charlie's uncomfortable

418
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,740
with all the details that
have anything to do with me.

419
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,110
Michael... (scoffs)
y-you're not being fair.

420
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,890
I'm not being fair?
No, you're not.

421
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,440
Well, I don't exactly want to be
in this position,

422
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,080
'cause I don't want to say no.

423
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,420
Then don't. You know this book
means everything to me.

424
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,080
And Charlie means
everything to me.

425
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,000
Look, when you left,
I was broken.

426
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,070
And Charlie
put me back together again.

427
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,460
I know this
sucks, but,

428
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,960
you know, I have to choose her
and her feelings.

429
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,580
She's my partner.

430
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,010
For life.

431
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,300
CHARLIE:
Oh, baby.

432
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,800
(sighs)

433
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,940
All right.

434
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,270
We'll sign the
damn papers.

435
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,610
Really?

436
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,610
What?

437
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,860
Yes, really. It's fine.

438
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,640
(gasps)
MICHAEL:
Well, wait. Hold on, now.

439
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,260
We-we flew all the
way from Montana

440
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,260
so you could tell Jane
all the things you hated

441
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,100
about the book,
and now you're fine with it?

442
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,450
Michael,
let's take that yes.

443
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,960
I didn't come down here
just for the book.

444
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,040
I wanted to see if...

445
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,460
y'all still had
anything between you.

446
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,130
I mean,

447
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,130
the way you went on about how...

448
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,950
y'all were destined
to be together and how,

449
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,890
when you saw him,
your heart would glow.

450
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,720
Didn't exactly go down
like pickle juice.

451
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,120
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Very little does.</i>

452
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,680
I get it.

453
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,130
That was a long time ago.

454
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,300
(sighs softly)

455
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,650
And I do think it was destiny.

456
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,150
Now you're not helping.

457
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,730
But I do.
Everything that's happened,

458
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,240
all the moments
that led to this--

459
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,190
you two finding each other--

460
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,410
it couldn't have happened
any other way.

461
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,860
I really believe that
to be true.

462
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,950
What?
(clears throat)

463
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,980
I asked you once
if you still loved her.

464
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,990
You said, "Yes. Forever."

465
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,320
'Cause of what we had once.

466
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,340
And 'cause she stuck with me
and helped me find myself again.

467
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,050
Which led me to you.

468
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,510
Hmm.

469
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,020
(chuckles)

470
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,220
(Jane sniffling)

471
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,000
Geez, she does cry a lot.

472
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,890
See? I told you.
(chuckles)

473
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,890
(sniffles)
So, we're good?

474
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,230
No issues with privacy
or anything?

475
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,730
Nah. No one I know would
ever read that book anyway.

476
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,730
Huh. Okay, then.
(chuckles)

477
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,200
Oh, but could you just...
leave out

478
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,850
this one part
right...

479
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,540
there?

<i> So I will, too.</i>

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,290
No problem. It's gone.

483
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,920
Uh... Oh. There's one thing
you got wrong in the book.

484
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,380
Um, Rose isn't 38.

485
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,920
She's 51.
What? No.

486
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,060
She's a plastic surgery
expert, remember?

487
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,310
Wow. Okay.

488
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,310
I will make that change.

489
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,210
Goodbye, Jane.

490
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,880
Goodbye, Michael.

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> And this time, friends,</i>

492

RAFAEL:
<i> Don't go.</i>

494

A funeral is the absolute wrong
place to try to win back an ex.

495
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,080
I wouldn't be trying
to win J.R. back.

496
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,580
I'd just be going
to pay my respects.

497
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,830
If you really want
to be respectful,

498
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,670
then let her mourn
her mother in peace.

499
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,960
Yeah, yeah.
You're right.

500
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,580
So, have you quit
your real estate job?

501
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,800
Not yet.
What? Why?

502
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,420
Well, honestly, because
this project is gonna be a lot.

503
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,180
And I'd need
to be all in.

504
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,640
And I've already
missed dinners with the kids

505
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,640
for the past few weeks,
and I don't want that.

506
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,920
I totally get that.

507
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,810
And I think I have a solution.

508
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,610
Move back in to the Marbella.

509
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
Your old penthouse
is vacant right now.

510
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,030
Look, you, Jane, Mateo,
me and the twins.

511
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,450
You'd have your whole family
under one very large roof.

512
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,040
Plus, you'd have zero commute
and never miss a bedtime.

513
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,940
Every night, I get to
put the girls to bed

514
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,780
and then come right back
down here and keep working.

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,670
Hey, I know you're busy,

519
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,620
but give me a call back
when you're done.

520
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,340
I have really great news.

521
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,470
Do tell, Jane.

522
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,390
What's the great news?
(exhales sharply)

523
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,800
I got to say, Jane,

524
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,640
I'm a little disappointed.

525
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,360
I was really hoping for Rafael

526
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,860
since he's the one who
got me thrown in jail.

527
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,660
But it's fine.

528
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,480
You'll do.

529
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,310
Aw.

530
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,120
You poor little thing.

531
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,120
Always in the wrong place

532
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,700
at the wrong time, aren't you?

533
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,320
I heard you came
to visit me in prison.

534
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,940
Was there something
you wanted to say?

535
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,130
'Cause I'm all ears.

536
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,780
(breathing shakily)

537
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,220
"After everything
you've done to me.

538
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,170
"Kidnapping my baby.

539
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,050
"Shooting my husband.

540
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,790
"I think you're
the worst person

541
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,970
in the whole wide world!"
(laughs)

542
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,290
(meows)

543
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,140
Aw.

544
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,730
What's wrong?

545
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,480
Cat got your tongue?

546
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,010
Or villain got your cat?

547
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,230
(meows)

548
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:58,020
What do you w-want from me?

549
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,140
Wh-What do I w-want from you?
(meows)

550
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,530
(sighs)

551
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,530
I'm glad you asked.

552
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,040
I need Luisa to meet me

553
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,870
at your father's
premiere party.

554
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,340
And you're going to help me

555
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,010
get her there.

556
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,960
(breathing shakily)

557
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,430
How?

558
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,170
How? How could I do that?

559
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,550
Very good question, Jane.

560
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,390
I was thinking

561
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,670
you call her up,
and you say something like,

562
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,610
"Ditch the security guards
in Belize,

563
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,230
"hop on Pan Atlantic 7859
to Miami,

564
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,450
"and meet us at the party,

565
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,850
"or Rose will kill
someone you love.

566
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,070
"And if you tell anyone
Rose is holding me hostage,

567
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,120
Rose will kill
someone else you love."

568
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,040
Yeah, that should work.

569
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,130
Have you got it,
or do you want to practice?

570
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,880
P-Please. Please, you
don't have to do this.

571
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,250
Pick up the phone and call!

572
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,880
(phone beeps)

573
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,470
LUISA:
Hi. It's Luisa.
It's her voice mail.

574
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,220
Sorry I missed you.
Leave me a message,

575
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,480
and I'll get back to you
when I can.
Leave a message.

576
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,710
(phone beeps)

577
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,310
Hi, Luisa. It's Jane.

578
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,430
Rose is holding me hostage,

579
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,720
and she said that if you
don't get on flight...

580
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,390
Pan Atlantic 7859.

581
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,060
...Pan Atlantic 7859 to Miami

582
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,160
and meet her at my father's
premiere party, sh...

583
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,450
she'll kill someone you love.

584
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,280
And...?

585
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,920
And if you tell
anyone about this,

586
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,120
she'll kill another
person that you love.

587
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,290
Please, call us back.

588
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,430
(phone beeps)
Aw.

589
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,100
Let's hope she does.

590
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,680
It would sure be a shame
for someone

591
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,770
to have to die
over an unreturned phone call.

592
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,090
God, Mateo's
gotten so big.

593
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,860
I haven't
seen him since...

594
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,950
Oh, well, you remember,
of course.

595
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,320
(crying):
Please, please.

596
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,870
(ringtone playing)

597
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,710
(stammering):
It's an unknown number.

598
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,120
It could be her.

599
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,330
Put it on speaker.

600
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,330
(phone beeps)

601
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,460
Hello?

602
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,720
LILY:
Jane, it's Lily.

603
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,620
Oh. Hi.

604
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,890
I just got off the phone
with Little, Brown.

605
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,220
They love your book.

606
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,060
They're offering you 25,000.

607
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,460
Oh, wow.

608
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,180
Wow, that's great.

609
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,510
Everything okay?

610
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,070
Yeah, just... processing.

611
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,520
Well, process quickly,
because they need an answer.

612
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,490
So, what do you want to do?
Do you want to accept the offer,

613
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,470
or do you want to roll the dice
and hold out for a better one?

614
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,810
Here's the kicker: if you wait,

615
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,740
Little, Brown could pull their
offer, and there's no guarantee

616
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,810
that another publisher
is gonna step up and...

617
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,310
We're willing to take that risk.

618
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,320
This is Jane Villanueva's
attorney.

619
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,170
Call us back
when there's a real offer.

620
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,150
(phone beeps)

621
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,090
We have to keep the line open.

622
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,040
Honestly, Jane,

623
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,590
I just skimmed
your book,

624
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,260
but I found it very compelling.

625
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm flattered that you made me
such a big character.

626
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,050
Do you really think
I'm an icy beauty?

627
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,770
That was a compliment, Jane.

628
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,840
You could crack a smile.

629
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,560
(manuscript thuds)

630
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,480
(Rose whistling a tune)

631
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,790
Have some water.
You look parched.

632
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,360
(breathing shakily)

633
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,130
(ringtone playing)

634
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,750
It's Rafael. He was supposed to
meet me here before the party.

635
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,380
Tell him to meet you there.

636
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,200
And, Jane,

637
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,050
if you alert him in any way

638
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,590
or give him any kind
of secret code,

639
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,260
I will kill Mateo.

640
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,550
Hey, Raf.

641
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,980
RAFAEL:
Guess where I am.

642
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,650
My old penthouse.

643
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,240
Oh. (chuckles) What for?

644
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,770
Petra offered
to let us move back in.

645
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,220
And standing here, I'm just...

646
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,910
I'm having
the most intense feeling.

647
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,910
About where we started,
where we are now.

648
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,090
Uh, wow, yeah.

649
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,420
Well, it's definitely something
we should talk about,

650
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,590
but can we do it later?

651
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,920
Are you okay?

652
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,760
You sound a little off.

653
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,180
Y-Yeah, it's all good.
I'm just busy

654
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,180
trying to get ready
for the party. (chuckles)

655
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,630
Uh, let's meet there, okay?

656
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,630
What?

657
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,970
Why? I'm wrapping up here.

658
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,100
I'll be home in... 30 minutes.

659
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,270
No, don't come home!

660
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,690
Why? What's going on?

661
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,280
I'm just planning something
for you

662
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,110
for the wedding,
and you can't see it.

663
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,150
Oh. Sorry.

664
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,280
But now I kind of want to know
what it is.

665
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,100
Yeah. Bye. Love you.

666
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,490
Ah! Okay.

667
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,370
Okay, I'll see you at the party.

668
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,870
See you at the party.

669
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,710
Well done, you
pretty little liar.

670
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,130
Why are you doing this?

671
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,640
Luisa doesn't want to
be with you anymore.

672
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,790
That's because you all
have poisoned her against me.

673
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,560
No, it's...

674
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,890
it's because
she doesn't love you anymore.

675
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,230
She does love me.

676
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,520
She doesn't.

677
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,070
And I know it's
hard and painful,

678
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,630
but people fall
out of love.

679
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,900
Michael and I did.

680
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,570
This is different.
How?

681
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,740
Because this isn't
your love story, Jane.

682
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,740
It's mine.

683
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,640
(ringtone playing)

684
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,330
It's her.

685
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,330
(phone beeps)

686
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Hi, beautiful.

687
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,490
I take it you got my message?

688
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,170
LUISA:
I'll do whatever you want, Rose.

689
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,540
Just don't hurt anybody.

690
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,490
I'm on my way to the airport
right now.

691
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,660
Fantastic.
(phone beeps)

692
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,180
Yay! We're going to a party.

693
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,850
Should we get dressed?

694
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,980
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Wow, they really know</i>

695
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,060
<i> how to commit to a theme</i>

I sent flowers and a note
to J.R. You were right.

And honestly,
the Marbella satisfies me

So you'll come to New York?
No.

870
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,290
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i> Literally.</i>

871
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,110
The point is,
I turned down the 25 K.

872
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,740
I thought about it,
and the only way

873
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,160
to get what you want is
to put the book up for auction.

874
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,750
I've asked for first offers
by 3:00 p.m. today.

875
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,880
Oh, wow.
Uh, but isn't that, uh...?

876
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,590
Risky? Yes.

877
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,760
So I want to prepare you.
We could get a lot of bids,

878
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,120
or we could get none at all.

879
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,790
But you said
you want to roll the dice,

880
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,340
so be by your phone at 3:00 p.m.

881
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,630
Keep your fingers crossed.

882
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,130
Everything okay?

883
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,850
I just hope Rose
didn't ruin my one chance

884
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,130
at selling my book.

885
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,940
You would have taken
the 25,000?

886
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,640
No, I wouldn't have.

887
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,770
But it'd be easier to blame
Rose if it doesn't sell.

888
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,140
So...

889
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,480
have-have you made
your decision?

890
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,620
Yes, he has.

891
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,700
I will take the part of
the incredibly handsome villain,

892
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,840
and Darci, Baby and I
will move to New York.

893
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,170
Yes.

894
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,540
(laughing):
Yes!

895
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,800
Oh, my God!

896
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,680
You won't regret this.

897
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,970
I promise you won't. Thank you.

898
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,560
(screaming)
(laughing)

899
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,340
You did it, Smush!
Yeah!

900
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,650
I knew you could get a
giant part on his show!

901
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,680
I know! How great an actor am I?

902
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,850
I mean, the Reiki?
A higher calling than acting?

903
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,520
(laughs)

904
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,360
Put on your spacesuit, Mush.
We're going to Mars!

905
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,160
Oh!
Ah! Mmm!

906
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,000
It's from India.

907
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,880
I hope you like it.

908
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,590
Thank you... for
saving our lives.

909
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,260
Oh... (scoffs)

910
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,930
It was...
it was no big deal. I...

911
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,430
I couldn't let anything happen
to you before your big day.

912
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,190
We'd... really like you
to be there, actually.

913
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,550
What?

914
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,860
Come to our wedding.

915
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,110
Please?

916
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,690
I would love that.

917
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,950
Thank you.

918
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,780
(sniffles)
Oh, my God.

919
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,400
Have you thought
about the honeymoon?

920
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,920
Because one benefit
of hiding out

921
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,750
with an international
crime lord--

922
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,570
you had to know a lot
of secluded spots.

923
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,430
Oh, I don't think
we'll honeymoon.

924
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,380
Raf is so busy with work
at the Marbella.

925
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:00,300
Well, actually,
I quit last night.

926
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,770
What? I thought
the Marbella was your dream.

927
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,940
It was, but like
I told Petra,

928
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,110
my dream has changed.

929
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,730
I want time with my family.

930
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,430
So, I'm gonna keep
my real estate job,

931
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,440
and we'll save, buy a
little house down the line.

932
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,940
(laughs)

933
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,320
Yeah?

934
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,120
And you're okay with that?

935
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,280
A... a little house?

936
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,660
A smaller life?

937
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,000
Doesn't feel smaller at all.

938
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,090
(crying): Oh, my God, Raf,
you've grown up so much.

939
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,920
(laughs)
Aw.

940
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,450
I...
(laughs)

941
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,670
I can't wait
for your wedding, you guys.

<i> we get to the wedding,</i>

943

944
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,960
Ah, what if nobody bids?

945
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,480
Uh, what if
my book doesn't sell?

946
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,940
Just take a deep breath.

947
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,310
It's gonna be okay.

948
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,310
(phone chimes)

949
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,780
First offer came in.

950
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,330
10,000.

951
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,200
Okay. Uh, we got one.

Hey.

953
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,620

to sneeze at.

faceless publisher,
whoever you are.

961
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,720
Now I don't feel like
such an idiot

962
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,520
for not taking that 25.
Fist bump on that.

Yup.

I know. It's just...

1001

we're not gonna be heree
when the first check comes

1002
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,610
or when the book
is published.

1003

It's finally hitting me.

1004

We're leaving Miami
and moving away from our family.
