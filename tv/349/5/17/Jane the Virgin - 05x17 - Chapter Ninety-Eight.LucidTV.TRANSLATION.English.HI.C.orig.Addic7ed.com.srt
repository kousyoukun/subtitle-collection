Maybe? I have to remember
the tapping pattern,

Oh. Yeah. No, I get it. I'll go.

159
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,178
Y-You can make
the time up later.

160
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:09,223
Obviously, there are
so many international hurdles

161
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:11,402
we'll have to deal with since
it's a British overseas property,

162
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:12,646
but we'll chip away at them.

163
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:14,514
Hopefully, we can close
the deal in 12 months.

164
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,474
Yeah. That sounds great.

165
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,619
You seem overwhelmed.

166
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:21,094
I am... a little.

167
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,591
Well... I get it.

168
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,159
You're working two jobs.

169
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:27,432
I know we had our worries
about working together,

170
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,163
but things have been going
really well between us.

171
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:34,344
So why don't we fully
commit to this partnership?

172
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:35,828
Hmm?

173
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:37,273
Quit your real estate
agent thing.

174
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:39,052
Let's go all in.

175
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:41,277
JANE:
<i>What did you say?</i>

176
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:43,479
I said, "That makes sense."

177
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:45,320
The thing is,
I'm torn about quitting.

178
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:46,428
Why?

179
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:48,106
There'll be a lot
of stress and travel

180
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:50,099
and risk involved
with no guaranteed payoff.

181
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:51,639
I mean, I could spend

182
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:53,317
years negotiating
the new franchise,

183
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:54,885
and then nothing
could come of it.

184
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:56,520
Well, you can't live in fear

185
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:57,938
of what's coming
around the corner.

186
00:06:58,298 --> 00:06:59,747
Huh. Well, it looks like

187
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:01,391
somebody's learned a
thing or two in therapy.

188
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,883
This is your dream.

189
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:04,110
Go for it.

190
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:05,542
Be brave.

191
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:08,061
Hey, that's my line.

192
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:10,257
Well, it's works, and it's true.

193
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,380
Look who's getting
a free lunch tomorrow.

194
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:14,816
I am so proud of you.

195
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,275
(LAUGHS)
You're gonna kill it.

196
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:19,793
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, friends, look at Jane,
ready to kill it,</i>

197
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:22,329
<i>and by "it,"
I mean that free lunch.</i>

198
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,364
Hey, Lily, uh,
I just got to the restaurant.

199
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,799
Oh, wait. I meant to ask you.

200
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,712
Should I order
a glass of wine at lunch,

201
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:28,887
or is that inappropriate?

202
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:30,278
LILY: <i>Jane, the editor's not coming.</i>

203
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,804
What? Why?

204
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,922
We have a problem.

205
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:35,012
Uh, what is it? (LAUGHS)

206
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:37,853
Michael Cordero never
signed away his life rights.

207
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,412
<i>Without his permission,
the book can't be published.</i>

208
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,809
NARRATOR:
<i>Yup.</i>

209
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,686
<i>There's always something
unexpected around the corner.</i>

210
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:47,735
(SIGHS)

211
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:14,261
- Michael?
- NARRATOR:<i> Yeah.</i>

212
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:16,391
- <i>None of us were expecting that.</i>
- Yup.

213
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,422
And if he won't sign over his
life rights, there's no book.

214
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:21,373
Well, you have to call him
and convince him.

215
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,610
Yeah. I will.

216
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:27,193
So, I guess I'll just...

217
00:08:27,377 --> 00:08:28,760
call him right now.

218
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:30,838
I have the number to the ranch.

219
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,933
Rick?

220
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:36,778
It's the ranch foreman.

221
00:08:36,803 --> 00:08:38,586
Um, uh, yeah, hi.

222
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:41,111
I-I'm looking for
Michael... or Jason.

223
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:42,140
Michael-Jason.

224
00:08:42,685 --> 00:08:44,287
Oh. Really?

225
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:45,957
Okay. Thank you.

226
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:49,329
So, I guess Michael
took off a few days ago.

227
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:51,536
Rick suggested I try
calling his mom.

228
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,904
NARRATOR: <i>Can't the guy just get
a freaking cell phone?</i>

229
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:57,489
So I'll just... call her now.

230
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:00,468
Voice mail.

231
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:02,452
Hi, Patricia. It's Jane.

232
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:04,937
Uh, can you please
give me a call back

233
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,109
when you have a chance?

234
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:07,972
Thank you.
Hope all is well.

235
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:11,206
Okay. So, hopefully,
she'll call back,

236
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:12,300
- and then we'll just...
- PETRA: Rafael!

237
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,237
Sounds like she needs you.

238
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,927
I have to get ready
for my shift anyway.

239
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,207
Krishna! Pull up the preliminary
inspection reports

240
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:23,399
on the Turks and Caicos property
to show Rafael.

241
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:26,821
- What were you looking at?
- Nothing.

242
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:28,983
I'll remind you
of the Marbella's

243
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:31,017
"no porn, no TMZ, no Goop"
Internet policy.

244
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:33,498
NARRATOR:
<i>Whew! I would not last there.</i>

245
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:36,814
<i>Is that...?</i>

246
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:38,568
- J.R.'s mother?
- I'm sorry.

247
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:40,915
I promise I wasn't stalking
your ex-girlfriend.

248
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:42,337
That would be creepy.

249
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:43,615
I just love obits.

250
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,087
NARRATOR:
<i>'Cause that's not creepy.</i>

251
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:50,507
_

252
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,589
_

253
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:56,289
Oh. I guess
J.R. will be in town.

254
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,081
You okay?

255
00:09:58,754 --> 00:09:59,895
Yeah. fine.

256
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,475
Krishna, let's see
those reports.

257
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:04,515
- What's this?
- ROGELIO: All the reasons why

258
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,574
moving to New York would be
incredible for you and Baby.

259
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,561
God, you're a slow reader.
Let me just tell you.

260
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:16,664
Did you know that New York
has the most single people

261
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,655
per capita
in the entire country?

262
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:20,369
NARRATOR: <i>Ooh.</i>
I<i> should move there.</i>

263
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:23,586
And that single women outnumber
single men almost two to one?

264
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:24,645
NARRATOR:
<i>Never mind.</i>

265
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:27,240
Those lonely souls need you
and your matchmaking skills.

266
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,267
Also, New York has
the best pizza in the world!

267
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:34,470
Plus, everyone is rude there,
and you love being rude.

268
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:38,913
And have I mentioned
Alexandria Ocasio...?

269
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:40,131
Rogelio, stop.

270
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:42,452
You do remember
I'm from New York, right?

271
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:44,962
I would actually
love to move back there.

272
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:47,237
Really? You would?

273
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,165
But Esteban.
He loves Miami.

274
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,401
The bozo even thinks Miami
pizza's the best in the world.

275
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,370
NARRATOR:
<i>Yeah, Esteban.</i>

276
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,022
<i>Gonna have to disagree with you.</i>

277
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,191
(RINGTONE PLAYING)

278
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,409
(GASPS)

279
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:03,031
PATRICIA (OVER PHONE):
<i>Hi, Jane.</i>

280
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:05,071
Hi, Patricia.
Thank you for calling back.

281
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,642
Uh, I didn't mean to bother you,

282
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,066
but I'm trying
to track down Michael.

283
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:09,293
Do you know where he is?

284
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,653
<i>I do, actually.</i>

285
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,709
MICHAEL (OVER PHONE):
<i>Hi, Jane.</i>

286
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:16,608
Oh, uh, Michael, hi.

287
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,869
I... I didn't know
you were in Florida.

288
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:22,267
Yeah. I am.

289
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,211
Uh, anyway,
I-I'm sorry to bug you,

290
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:28,962
but I wanted to talk to you
about my novel.

291
00:11:29,406 --> 00:11:30,483
You probably didn't get it,

292
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:32,491
but my agent sent over paperwork
for you to sign.

293
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:34,340
Oh, I got it. I just...

294
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:35,367
didn't sign it. Um...

295
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:38,195
I wanted to talk to you
in person.

296
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:39,926
Which is actually
why I'm in town.

297
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:41,805
Uh...

298
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:44,010
So, what do you think?

299
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,806
You have to meet him.

300
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,603
- It's your book.
- I know, but...

301
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:52,754
He's making the effort to drive
all the way down here to see me.

302
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:56,817
I-I'm worried
it's not just about the book.

303
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,748
Well, I obviously don't think
it's about the book, either.

304
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:01,382
I think he wants
to try to win you back.

305
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,220
But I'm not worried about that.

306
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:05,868
Good.

307
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:07,857
Because I love you so much.

308
00:12:08,372 --> 00:12:10,105
I love you, too.
(CHUCKLES)

309
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:12,009
Now go get those life rights.

310
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:15,105
Thank you for understanding.

311
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,262
ROGELIO:
<i>You're welcome.</i>

312
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:18,998
Someone just got you
a recurring role

313
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,436
on<i> This Is Mars.</i>
You are back, baby!

314
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:26,809
Biggest acting opportunity
of your life!

315
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:28,869
No, thanks.

What?

317
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,726
Why?

318
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,572
I've decided to quit acting.

319
00:12:33,657 --> 00:12:36,691
I've gotten really
into aromatherapy and Reiki.

320
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,360
I'm committed to
being a spiritual

321
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:41,055
and physical healer
of bodies and souls.

he's dressed like my yoga teacher.</i>

I have a higher calling now.

324
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:48,157
I truly want to help people.

325
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,384
But why help a few scrawny
unwashed vegans

326
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:55,883
when you can reach millions
of normal people

327
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,117
by entertaining them?

328
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,281
I get great satisfaction

329
00:12:59,306 --> 00:13:01,932
out of my one-on-one
interactions with my clients.

330
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:05,859
Esteban, please, I will have to
give up on my dream

331
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:09,931
if you won't move to New York,
because I cannot leave Baby.

332
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:12,046
I wasn't a part
of Jane's childhood,

333
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,076
and I won't make
that mistake again.

334
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:15,975
Wow.

335
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:19,260
What a tremendous gesture
of love.

336
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:20,806
Baby is truly blessed to have

337
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:22,748
a beautiful person for a father.

338
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:28,043
It was a beautiful plan,
but it backfired.

339
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:29,765
I don't know what to do
about Esteban now.

340
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,727
He's become a completely
different person.

341
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:34,459
Then you have to remind him
of who he was,

342
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,703
of what inspired him
to become a telenovela actor

343
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:37,798
in the first place.

344
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,306
Just think,

345
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,486
what would remind you

346
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:43,188

Uh, okay. Why?

375
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:03,856
Why? 'Cause Michael's
all over the damn thing.

376
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,971
We live a quiet life.
We like our privacy.

377
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:08,034
And frankly, this little book
of yours seems like

378
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,497
it's gonna be
a big headache for us.

379

signing that paperwork.

Please?

381
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,175
Th-This book means
so much to me,

and I've worked so hard
on it... uh, for years.

383

is there anything I can do?

No. I asked.

bad, but, you know,

You can be the villain.

You had to know a lot
of secluded spots.

960
00:38:50,535 --> 00:38:52,689
Oh, I don't think
we'll honeymoon.

961
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:55,026
Raf is so busy with work
at the Marbella.

962
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:59,200
Well, actually,
I quit last night.

963
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:03,213
What? I thought
the Marbella was your dream.

964
00:39:03,322 --> 00:39:06,627
It was, but like I told Petra,

965
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:09,469
my dream has changed.

966
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,813
I want time with my family.

967
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:15,282
So, I'm gonna keep
my real estate job,

968
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:19,373
and we'll save, buy a
little house down the line.

(LAUGHS)

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,698
Yeah?

971
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,406
And you're okay with that?

972
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:26,424
A... a little house?

973
00:39:26,646 --> 00:39:27,979
A smaller life?

974
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,454
Doesn't feel smaller at all.

975

you've grown up so much.

Uh, what if
my book doesn't sell?

983
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,666
Just take a deep breath.
