1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,750
Friends,
we're almost at the end.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,670
And our Jane was approaching
the finish line as well.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,920
That's right,
she had finished her novel.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,590
You know, the one
based on her life.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,550
Oh, and she got herself
an agent.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,510
Yes!
<b></b>
And in more good news...

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,930
This Is Mars
got picked up to series.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,060
Unfortunately,
River Fields decided

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,430
to move the show to New York.
<b></b>
For my family.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,180
What about my family?

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,690
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of giant moves,

12
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,730
Rafael started working
for Petra,

13
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,570
and Petra was determined
to expand the Marbella.

14
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,570
I want a Marbella in every
major city, on every continent.

15
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,450
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Might as well dream big, right?

16
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,740
But not everything was dreamy.
Remember our evil villain Rose?

17
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,080
The one who kidnapped Mateo
and gave Michael amnesia?

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,210
Well, Jane was determined to
confront her once and for all.

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,080
If I can just say
my piece to her,

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,580
I really think
I'll be able to move on.

21
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,920
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Only problem...

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,750
(tires screeching)

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,010
Run!
<b></b>
Because of Luisa,

24
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,510
we were able to uncover Rose's

25
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,630
escape plan and send in a team
to capture her.

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,180
You're under arrest.

27
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,390
Luisa betrayed me?
<b></b>
Police!

28
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,140
Unfortunately,
things didn't go as planned,

29
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,520
and she escaped again.

30
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,270
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which, I'm afraid,

31
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,730
is where we left off.

32
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,860
Friends, after our
Jane Gloriana Villanueva

33
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,190
heard the news...

34
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:13,940
Rose escaped.

35
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,240
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, everything changed.

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,570
We don't know
where she is,

37
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,950
but Luisa's on her way
to a safe house in Belize.

38
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,740
We feel certain she will
try to contact her.

39
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,290
So my sister is bait?
<b></b>
Oh, she insisted.

40
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,370
She wanted to keep Rose away
from you and your family.

41
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,880
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, well, from that moment on,

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,340
our Jane was living
in a constant state of anxiety,

43
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,720
so her family stepped in
to help her cope.

44
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,430
BOTH:
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

45
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,310
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But despite their best efforts,

46
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,940
our Jane remained traumatized.

47
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,270
(exhales)

48
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,020
(screams)

49
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,030
Always on edge.

50
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,110
Afraid of what was lurking
around the corners,

51
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,820
in the shadows.

52
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,080
Yeah, it was the
air conditioner.

53
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,200
I checked, no one
is outside.

54
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,910
Are you okay?

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,540
No. I hate
living like this.

56
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,750
I know.

57
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,510
Maybe it's time for you
to get professional help.

58
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,850
But
after talking and talking...

59
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,260
I just can't talk anymore.

60
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,770
I know, logically,
Rose isn't coming,

61
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,350
but I can't shake this
feeling that there's

62
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,980
something horrible
just around the corner.

63
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,820
Which is no way to live.
<b></b>
Exactly.

64
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,150
And I need to figure out
how to manage my anxiety.

65
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,950
I think maybe
you should try tapping.

66
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,110
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I don't think tap dancing

67
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,450
is going to solve this problem.

68
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,790
One of the branches of therapy
I offer is EFT.

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,960
It's a self-soothing tool,
based in acupuncture.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,080
Well,
that makes much more sense.

71
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,920
Every time you feel anxious,

72
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,380
just tap along these meridians.

73
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,430
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here.

74
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,890
Is it working?
<b></b>
A little.

75
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,980
Maybe? I have to remember
the tapping pattern,

76
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,440
so that at least takes my mind
off of Rose. How was your day?

77
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,900
Ugh, stressful.

78
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,900
Petra keeps calling,
e-mailing and texting me

79
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,240
every two seconds.

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,240
She even had me paged
at the gym.

81
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,370
I can hardly use the
bathroom without her...

82
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,370
(ringtone playing)

83
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,580
Relax, it's my phone.

84
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,910
Maybe you should
start tapping.

85
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,000
Ooh, it's my agent.

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,500
(chuckles)
You love saying that.

87
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,750
I really do.

88
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,710
I should talk to my agent.

89
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,590
Hey, Lily.

90
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,550
Okay, Jane, listen, I have news.

91
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,800
Okay.

92
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,300
Good news or bad news?

93
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,010
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
In case you forgot,

94
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,600
Jane is not a fan
of unexpected news.

95
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,930
Oh, sorry. Sometimes I forget
how anxious you writers are.

96
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,600
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Especially a writer
whose villain

97
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,020
just broke out of prison.

98
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,610
It's good news.
Publishers are loving your book.

99
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,980
Oh, my God, really?

100
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,190
Really.

101
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,490
A couple editors
want to meet you,

102
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,570
so I'm setting some lunches.

103
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,860
Lunches?
Okay, sounds good.

104
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,280
Sure does.

105
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,160
I think you're gonna get
a good offer, Jane.

106
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,240
Wow.

107
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,580
That's great. Thank you.

108
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,250
Yes, talk to
you soon. Bye.

109
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,670
People like my book, and she
thinks I'm gonna get an offer.

110
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,880
A good one, she said.
<b></b>
What does that mean?

111
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,130
I don't know! I mean,
I would be happy with 25,000,

112
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,180
you know?
Thrilled with 50.

113
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,430
100 would be... too crazy.

114
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,310
I'd never get that, but can you
imagine if I got $50,000?

115
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,310
Oh, and guess what else.
They want to take me to lunches.

116
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,850
Multiple, fancy,

117
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,150
free lunches! Ooh!

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,280
(cash register dings)

119
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,160
So, I have
some good news.

120
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,080
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, looks like Jane
already called her mom.

121
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,500
What's going on?

122
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,130
I got into a nursing program
in New York,

123
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,460
so we can move there,

124
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,800
if we decide to.

125
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,800
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, different news.

126
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,880
That's great.
<b></b>
Is it?

127
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,220
I'm mixed on this whole

128
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,800
Ro-and-Xo-move-to-New-York
thing.

129
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,180
I'm just so mixed
on this whole

130
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,640
move-to-New-York thing.

131
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,770
I know, but at least
one roadblock is removed.

132
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,020
Hmm.
<b></b>
(phone chimes)

133
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,030
Aw.
<b></b>
Mm. (laughs)

134
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,530
So, should we talk
to Jane about it yet?

135
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,530
No. She has enough on her mind
with all the Rose trauma.

136
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,780
I-I don't want to get
into it until we know

137
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,620
if Darci and Esteban are even
willing to move with Baby.

138
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,750
Then we'll know
if we're actually going.

139
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,920
Okay.

140
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,460
Maybe we should try, uh,
Jane's tapping technique.

141
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,920
(footsteps approaching)

142
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,550
Oh, good. You're here.

143
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,800
How was the open house?
<b></b>
Well, there were two clients

144
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,430
that wouldn't really
leave even though they...
<b></b>
That was a courtesy question.

145
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,680
I don't care. Look, Clarissa
and her financial group

146
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,140
love this property
for our first franchise.

147
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,930
The building needs
to be razed,

148
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,560
but what about that view?!

149
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,940
We should go see it ASAP.
When can you travel?
<b></b>
Oh.

150
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,150
Petra, I... I can't, you know,
with Rose out there, and...

151
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,360
Oh. Yeah. No, I get it. I'll go.

152
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,990
Y-You can make
the time up later.

153
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,530
Obviously, there are
so many international hurdles

154
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,410
we'll have to deal with
since it's a British

155
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,410
overseas property,
but we'll chip away at them.

156
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,200
Hopefully, we can close
the deal in 12 months.

157
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,660
Yeah. That sounds great.

158
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,960
You seem overwhelmed.

159
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,380
I am... a little.

160
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,420
Well... I get it.

161
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,010
You're working two jobs.

162
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,840
I know we had our worries
about working together,

163
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,590
but things have been going
really well between us.

164
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,850
So why don't we fully commit
to this partnership? Hmm?

165
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,310
Quit your real estate
agent thing.

166
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,060
Let's go all in.

167
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,310
JANE:
What did you say?

168
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,520
I said, "That makes sense."

169
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,610
The thing is, I'm
torn about quitting.
<b></b>
Why?

170
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,400
There'll be a lot
of stress and travel

171
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,990
and risk involved
with no guaranteed payoff.

172
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,740
I mean, I could
spend years

173
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,950
negotiating the new franchise,

174
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,540
and then nothing
could come of it.

175
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,160
Well, you can't
live in fear

176
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,040
of what's coming
around the corner.

177
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,540
Huh. Well, it looks like

178
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,580
somebody's learned a
thing or two in therapy.

179
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,000
This is your dream.

180
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,750
Go for it. Be brave.

181
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,090
Hey, that's my line.

182
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,510
Well, it's works, and it's true.

183
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,640
Look who's getting
a free lunch tomorrow.

184
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,300
I am so proud of you.

You're gonna kill it.

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, friends, look at Jane,
ready to kill it,

187
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,350
and by "it,"
I mean that free lunch.

(cell phone buzzing)

188
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Hey, Lily, uh,
I just got to the restaurant.

189
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,820
Oh, wait. I meant to ask you.

190
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,530
Should I order
a glass of wine at lunch,

191
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,940
or is that inappropriate?

192
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,360
Jane, the editor's not coming.

193
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,950
What? Why?

194
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,030
We have a problem.

195
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,160
Uh, what is it? (laughs)

196
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,000
Michael Cordero never
signed away his life rights.

197
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,080
Without his permission,
the book can't be published.

198
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yup.

199
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,040
There's always something
unexpected around the corner.

200
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,130
(sighs)

201
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,340
Michael?
<b></b>
Yeah.

202
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,350
None of us were
expecting that.
<b></b>
Yup.

203
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,980
And if he won't sign over his
life rights, there's no book.

204
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,730
Well, you have to call him
and convince him.

205
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,150
Yeah. I will.

206
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,770
So, I guess I'll just...

207
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,230
call him right now.

208
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,150
I have the number
to the ranch.

209
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,410
Rick?

210
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,200
It's the ranch foreman.

211
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,040
Um, uh, yeah, hi.

212
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,950
I-I'm looking for
Michael-- or Jason.

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,410
Michael-Jason.

214
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,710
Oh. Really?

215
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,960
Okay. Thank you.

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,460
So, I guess Michael
took off a few days ago.

217
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,590
Rick suggested I try
calling his mom.

218
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,590
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Can't the guy just get
a freaking cell phone?

219
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,470
So I'll just... call her now.

220
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,140
Voice mail.

Hmm.

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,810
Hi, Patricia. It's Jane.

00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,060
Uh, can you please
give me a call back

223
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,440
when you have a chance?

224
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,900
Thank you. Hope all is well.

225
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,320
Okay. So, hopefully,
she'll call back,

Sounds like
she needs you.

I have to get ready
for my shift anyway.

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,450
Krishna! Pull up the preliminary

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,710
on the Turks and Caicos property

What were you looking at?

Nothing.

232
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,090
I'll remind you
of the Marbella's

"no porn, no TMZ, no Goop"
Internet policy.

Whew! I would not last there.

235
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,140
Is that...?

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,220
J.R.'s mother?

I'm sorry.

I promise I wasn't stalking
your ex-girlfriend.

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,980
That would be creepy.
I just love obits.

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
'Cause that's not creepy.

Oh. I guess
J.R. will be in town.

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,320
You okay?

242
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,740
Yeah. fine.

What's this?

ROGELIO:
All the reasons why

245
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,790
moving to New York would be
incredible for you and Baby.

246
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,010
God, you're a slow reader.
Let me just tell you.

247
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,630
Did you know that New York
has the most single people

248
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
per capita
in the entire country?

249
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,680
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
should move there.

250
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,600
And that single women outnumber
single men almost two to one?

251
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,180
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Never mind.

252
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,810
Those lonely souls need you
and your matchmaking skills.

253
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,360
Oh...
<b></b>
Also, New York has
the best pizza in the world!

254
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,570
Plus, everyone is rude there,
and you love being rude.

255
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,450
And have I mentioned
Alexandria Ocasio...?

256
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,450
Rogelio, stop.

257
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,870
You do remember
I'm from New York, right?

258
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,040
I would actually

259
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,330
love to move back there.

260
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,540
Really? You would?

261
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,670
But Esteban.
He loves Miami.

262
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,750
The bozo even thinks Miami
pizza's the best in the world.

263
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,720
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, Esteban.

264
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,340
Gonna have
to disagree with you.

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,510
(ringtone playing)

266
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,760

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,220
PATRICIA (over phone):
Hi, Jane.

268
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,930
Hi, Patricia.
Thank you for calling back.

269
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,560
Uh, I didn't mean to bother you,

270
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,020
but I'm trying
to track down Michael.

271
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,350
Do you know where he is?

272
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,770
I do, actually.

273
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,520
MICHAEL (over phone):
Hi, Jane.

274
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,690
Oh, uh, Michael, hi.

275
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,200
I... I didn't know
you were in Florida.

276
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,030
Yeah. I am.

277
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,040
Uh, anyway,
I-I'm sorry to bug you,

278
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,250
but I wanted to talk to you
about my novel.

279
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,670
You probably didn't get it,

280
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,710
but my agent sent over paperwork
for you to sign.

281
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,630
Oh, I got it. I just...

282
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,050
didn't sign it. Um...

283
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,300
I wanted to talk to you
in person.

284
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,220
Which is actually
why I'm in town.

285
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,470
Uh...

286
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,720
So, what do you think?

287
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,770
You have to meet him.

288
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,600
It's your book.
<b></b>
I know, but...

289
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,850
He's making the effort to drive
all the way down here to see me.

290
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,150
I-I'm worried
it's not just about the book.

291
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,440
Well, I obviously don't think
it's about the book, either.

292
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,660
I think he wants
to try to win you back.

293
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,570
But I'm not worried about that.

294
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,410
Good.

295
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,290
Because I love you so much.

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,080
I love you, too.

(chuckles)

297
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,540
Now go get those
life rights.

298
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,170
Thank you for understanding.

299
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,380
ROGELIO:
You're welcome.

300
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,010
Someone just got you
a recurring role

301
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,720
This Is Mars.
You are back, baby!

302
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,970
Biggest acting opportunity
of your life!

303
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,220
No, thanks.

304
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,020
What? Why?

305
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,850
I've decided to quit acting.

306
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,940
I've gotten really
into aromatherapy and Reiki.

307
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,610
I'm committed to
being a spiritual

308
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,990
and physical healer
of bodies and souls.

309
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,030
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, so that's why he's dressed
like my yoga teacher.

310
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,580
I have a higher
calling now.

311
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,490
I truly want to help people.

312
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,160
But why help a few scrawny
unwashed vegans

313
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,880
when you can reach millions
of normal people

314
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,460
by entertaining them?

315
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,300
I get great satisfaction

316
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,300
out of my one-on-one
interactions with my clients.

317
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,890
Esteban, please, I will have to
give up on my dream

318
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,220
if you won't move to New York,
because I cannot leave Baby.

319
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,180
I wasn't a part
of Jane's childhood,

320
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,690
and I won't make
that mistake again.

321
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,520
Wow.

322
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,650
What a tremendous gesture
of love.

323
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,110
Baby is truly
blessed to have

324
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,070
a beautiful person for a father.

325
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,410
It was a beautiful plan,
but it backfired.

326
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,370
I don't know what to do
about Esteban now.

327
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,120
He's become a completely
different person.

328
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,540
Then you have to remind him
of who he was,

329
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,710
of what inspired him
to become a telenovela actor

330
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,130
in the first place.

331
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,540
Just think,

332
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,630
what would remind you

333
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,630
of why you love acting?

334
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,720
(gasps)
Me.

Hi, Jane.

Uh...

341
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,840
So, you wanted to talk
about the book in person?

342
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,260
Yeah. Um, we're not
totally okay with it.

343
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,760
You and Bo?

344
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,260
No, uh, me and my fiancée.

345
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,140

to win Jane back,

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,350
this is a weird way to do it.

347
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,480
You're marrying Charlie?

348
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,190
But she hates you.

349
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,110
Yeah, well, not anymore.

350
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,150
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Guess it's a shotgun wedding.

351
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,820
(gun fires, clicks)

352
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,320
Wow.

353
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,820
Congratulations.

354
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,320
I am so happy for you guys.

355
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,830
Thanks.

356
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,040
Now, let's talk about this book.
<b></b>
(thuds)

357
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,330
I read it. I don't like it.

358
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,630
Uh, okay. Why?

359
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,420
Why? 'Cause Michael's
all over the damn thing.

360
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,460
We live a quiet life.
We like our privacy.

361
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,220
And frankly, this little book
of yours seems like

362
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,970
it's gonna be
a big headache for us.

363
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,760
So I don't want Michael
signing that paperwork.

364
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,220
Please?

365
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,220
Th-This book means
so much to me,

366
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,440
and I've worked so hard
on it-- uh, for years.

367
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,730
Sorry about that.

368
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,690
You're a writer.
Write another one.

369
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,610
(exhales)

370
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,030
Michael, please?

371
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,700
This is a family decision, Jane,

372
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,830
and I support
whatever Charlie wants.

373
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,330
Well, this damn baby's
sitting on my bladder again.

374
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,880
So, I better

375
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,630
hit the commode,
as y'all like to say down here.

376
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,960
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh, no one says that.

377
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,300
Please? Okay,
is there anything I can do?

378
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,010
Does she want
more prize chickens?

379
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,760
No. I asked.

380
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,640
Look, I-I feel real
bad, but, you know,

381
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,850
Charlie is my fiancée and
the mother of my child,

382
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,810
and if she's uncomfortable
with all this,

383
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,480
there's nothing I can do.

384
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,110
ROGELIO:
I know you said no,

385
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,570
but I have something
to show you

386
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,400
that might change
your mind about acting.

387
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,530
Rogelio, I have a sound
bath in ten minutes.

388
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,820
I'll be quick.

389
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,370
(dramatic music playing
over computer)

390
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,370
(clears throat)

391
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,140
They're all... me.

392
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,480
(audience oohing)

393
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,400
(cheering)

394
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,860
(steady beeping)

395
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,380
I am an incredible actor.

396
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes! I agree.

397
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,840
And you can't throw
all this talent away.

398
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,010
I can, actually.

399
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,430
Why?

400
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,260
Because I've played every part.

401
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,270
And I stuck the landing
in all of them,

402
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,230
not just in
Vault for Your Love.

403
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,230
So, why keep acting?

404
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,350
What else is there?

405
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,360
Great fame in America.

406
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,440
I am about to go
to a premiere party

407
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,780
where my face will be
on every poster,

408
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,360
every wall, every tablecloth.

409
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,200
Reporters will be
taking my picture,

410
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,030
and people will be fainting
when they see me.

411
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,200
And it's going to be
the best feeling in the world!

412
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,920
Funny. I-I can't even imagine
what that feels like.

413
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,630
(gasps)
<b></b>
Which must mean
I've moved on.

414
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,340
JANE:
Okay, well,
here's another idea.

415
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,760
You go through the book,
and any details

416
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,300
you're not comfortable with,
I'll take out.

417
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,140
Well, I'm pretty sure
Charlie's uncomfortable

418
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,800
with all the details that
have anything to do with me.

419
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,180
Michael... (scoffs)
y-you're not being fair.

420
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,930
I'm not being fair?
<b></b>
No, you're not.

421
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,520
Well, I don't exactly want to be
in this position,

422
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,150
'cause I don't want to say no.

423
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,480
Then don't. You know this book
means everything to me.

424
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,150
And Charlie means
everything to me.

425
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,070
Look, when you left,
I was broken.

426
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,110
And Charlie
put me back together again.

427
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,530
I know this
sucks, but,

428
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,030
you know, I have to choose her
and her feelings.

429
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,620
She's my partner.

430
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,080
For life.

431
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,370
CHARLIE:
Oh, baby.

432
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,880
(sighs)

433
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,000
All right.

434
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,340
We'll sign the
damn papers.

435
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,670
Really?

436
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,670
What?

437
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,300
Yes, really. It's fine.

438
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,720
(gasps)
<b></b>
MICHAEL:
Well, wait. Hold on, now.

439
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,300
We-we flew all the
way from Montana

440
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,310
so you could tell Jane
all the things you hated

441
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,140
about the book,
and now you're fine with it?

442
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,520
Michael,
let's take that yes.

443
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,020
I didn't come down here
just for the book.

444
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,110
I wanted to see if...

445
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,530
y'all still had
anything between you.

446
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,200
I mean,

447
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,200
the way you went on about how...

448
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,990
y'all were destined
to be together and how,

449
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,950
when you saw him,
your heart would glow.

450
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,790
Didn't exactly go down
like pickle juice.

451
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,160
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Very little does.

452
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,750
I get it.

453
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,170
That was a long time ago.

454
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,340
(sighs softly)

455
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,710
And I do think it was destiny.

456
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,220
Now you're not helping.

457
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,800
But I do.
Everything that's happened,

458
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,300
all the moments
that led to this--

459
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,260
you two finding each other--

460
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,470
it couldn't have happened
any other way.

461
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,930
I really believe that
to be true.

462
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,020
What?
<b></b>
(clears throat)

463
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,030
I asked you once
if you still loved her.

464
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,030
You said, "Yes. Forever."

465
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,360
'Cause of what we had once.

466
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,410
And 'cause she stuck with me
and helped me find myself again.

467
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,120
Which led me to you.

468
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,580
Hmm.

469
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,080
(chuckles)

470
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,290
(Jane sniffling)

471
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,040
Geez, she does cry a lot.

472
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,960
See? I told you.
<b></b>
(chuckles)

473
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,970
(sniffles)
So, we're good?

474
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,300
No issues with privacy
or anything?

475
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,800
Nah. No one I know would
ever read that book anyway.

476
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,810
Huh. Okay, then.
(chuckles)

477
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,270
Oh, but could you just...
leave out

478
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,890
this one part
right...

479
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,600
there?

480
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,270
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, she did.

481
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,690
So I will, too.

482
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,360
No problem. It's gone.

483
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,990
Uh... Oh. There's one thing
you got wrong in the book.

484
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,450
Um, Rose isn't 38.

485
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,990
She's 51.
What? No.

486
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,120
She's a plastic surgery
expert, remember?

487
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,370
Wow. Okay.

488
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,380
I will make that change.

489
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,250
Goodbye, Jane.

490
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,920
Goodbye, Michael.

And this time, friends,

492
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,680
it really was goodbye.

RAFAEL:
Don't go.

494
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,520
A funeral is the absolute wrong
place to try to win back an ex.

495
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,150
I wouldn't be trying
to win J.R. back.

496
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,650
I'd just be going
to pay my respects.

497
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,900
If you really want
to be respectful,

498
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,740
then let her mourn
her mother in peace.

499
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,030
Yeah, yeah.
You're right.

500
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,620
So, have you quit
your real estate job?

501
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,870
Not yet.
What? Why?

502
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,460
Well, honestly, because
this project is gonna be a lot.

503
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,250
And I'd need
to be all in.

504
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,710
And I've already
missed dinners with the kids

505
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,710
for the past few weeks,
and I don't want that.

506
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,960
I totally get that.

507
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,880
And I think I have a solution.

508
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,680
Move back in to the Marbella.

509
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,760
Your old penthouse
is vacant right now.

510
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,100
Look, you, Jane, Mateo,
me and the twins.

511
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,520
You'd have your whole family
under one very large roof.

512
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,100
Plus, you'd have zero commute
and never miss a bedtime.

513
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,980
Every night, I get to
put the girls to bed

514
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,820
and then come right back
down here and keep working.

515

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Lucky you.

516

You're practically
living here already.

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,610
Just think about it.

518

Hey, I know you're busy,

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,410
I have really great news.

521
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,540
Do tell, Jane.

522
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,460
What's the great news?
<b></b>
(exhales sharply)

523
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,590
I got to say, Jane,

524
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,430
I'm a little disappointed.

525
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,140
I was really hoping for Rafael

526
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,640
since he's the one who
got me thrown in jail.

527
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,440
But it's fine.

528
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,270
You'll do.

529
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,110
Aw.

530
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,900
You poor little thing.

531
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,900
Always in the wrong place

532
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,490
at the wrong time, aren't you?

533
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,110
I heard you came
to visit me in prison.

534
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,700
Was there something
you wanted to say?

535
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,910
'Cause I'm all ears.

536
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,540
(breathing shakily)

537
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,000
"After everything
you've done to me.

538
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,960
"Kidnapping my baby.

539
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,840
"Shooting my husband.

"I think you're
the worst person

Aw.

544
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,510
What's wrong?

545
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,260
Cat got your tongue?

546
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,810
Or villain got your cat?

547
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,020

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,810

I'm glad you asked.

552
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,830
I need Luisa to meet me

553
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,660
at your father's
premiere party.

554
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,120
And you're going to help me

555
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,750

How? How could I do that?

559
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,340
Very good question, Jane.

560
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,180
I was thinking

561
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,430
you call her up,
and you say something like,

562
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,390
"Ditch the security guards
in Belize,

563
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,020

"And if you tell anyone

568
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,820
Yeah, that should work.

569
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,910
Have you got it,
or do you want to practice?

570
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,660
P-Please. Please, you
don't have to do this.

571
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,040

Let's hope she does.

590
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,470
It would sure be a shame
for someone

591
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,550
to have to die
over an unreturned phone call.

592
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,850
God, Mateo's
gotten so big.

593

I haven't
seen him since...

594
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,730
Oh, well, you remember,

Please, please.

Hello?

LILY:
Jane, it's Lily.

603
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,370
Oh. Hi.

604
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,670
I just got off the phone
with Little, Brown.

605
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,000
They love your book.

606
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,840
They're offering you 25,000.

607
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,220
Oh, wow.

608
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,970
Wow, that's great.

609
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,300
Everything okay?

610
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,850
Yeah, just... processing.

611
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,310
Well, process quickly,
because they need an answer.

612
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,270
So, what do you want to do?
Do you want to accept the offer,

613
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,230
or do you want to roll the dice
and hold out for a better one?

614
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,570
Here's the kicker: if you wait,

615
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,530
Little, Brown could pull their
offer, and there's no guarantee

616
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,570
that another publisher
is gonna step up and...

617
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,070
We're willing to take that risk.

618
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,070
This is Jane Villanueva's
attorney.

619
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,950
Call us back
when there's a real offer.

620
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,910
(phone beeps)

621
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,870
We have to keep the line open.

622
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,830
Honestly, Jane,

623
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,380
I just skimmed
your book,

624
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,050
but I found it very compelling.

625
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,760
I'm flattered that you made me
such a big character.

626
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,840
Do you really think
I'm an icy beauty?

627
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,560
That was a compliment, Jane.

628
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
You could crack a smile.

629
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,350

634
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,540
It's Rafael. He was supposed to
meet me here before the party.

635
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,160
Tell him to meet you there.

636
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,960
And, Jane,

637
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,840
if you alert him in any way

638
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,380
or give him any kind
of secret code,

639
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,050
I will kill Mateo.

00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,760
RAFAEL:
Guess where I am.

642
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,430
My old penthouse.

643
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,020
Oh. (chuckles) What for?

644
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,560
Petra offered
to let us move back in.

645
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,980
And standing here, I'm just...

646
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,690
I'm having
the most intense feeling.

647
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,700
About where we started,
where we are now.

648
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,870
Uh, wow, yeah.

649
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,200
Well, it's definitely something
we should talk about,

650
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,370
but can we do it later?

651
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,710
Are you okay?

652
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,540
You sound a little off.

653
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,960
Y-Yeah, it's all good.
I'm just busy

654
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,960
trying to get ready
for the party. (chuckles)

655
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,420
Uh, let's meet there, okay?

656
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,420
What?

657
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,760
Why? I'm wrapping up here.

658
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,890
I'll be home in... 30 minutes.

659
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,050
No, don't come home!

660
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,470
Why? What's going on?

661
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,060
I'm just planning something
for you

662
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,890

663

Oh. Sorry.

664
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,070
But now I kind of want to know
what it is.

Yeah. Bye. Love you.

00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,280
Ah! Okay.

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,160
Okay, I'll see you at the party.

668

See you at the party.

669
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,490
Well done, you
pretty little liar.

670
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,920
Why are you doing this?

671
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,420
Luisa doesn't want to
be with you anymore.

672
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,550
That's because you all
have poisoned her against me.

673
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,340
No, it's...

674
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,680
it's because
she doesn't love you anymore.

675
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,010
She does love me.

676
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,310
She doesn't.

677
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,850
And I know it's
hard and painful,

678
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,390
but people fall
out of love.

679
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,690
Michael and I did.

680
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,350
This is different.

How?

681
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,520
Because this isn't
your love story, Jane.

682
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,530
It's mine.

684
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,110

LUISA:
I'll do whatever you want, Rose.

689
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,330
Just don't hurt anybody.

690
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,250

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,980
Over here, Esteban!

Look over here!

699
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,530
Over here!

700
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,490
Yes, Esteban!

Take one photo.

701
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,700
Esteban. Fantastic.

Esteban.

702
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,120
Over here, Esteban!

703
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Esteban sure is

704
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,410
working those Estebuns.

705
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,290
(laughs, sighs)

706
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,540
That's weird.

707
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,090
I still haven't heard from Jane.
She should be here by now.

708
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,210
REPORTER:
Come on, get out of the way!

Damn it!

709
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,010
Those aliens are
in his shot.

710
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,220
Move! Move!

711
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,630
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Alas, friends,

712
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,390
those aren't just any aliens.

713
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,770
(whimpers softly)

714
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,190
Looking good, guys.

715
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,690
ROSE:
Grab a tray.

716
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,900
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know Jane's had
some stressful days

717
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,780
as a waitress, but this
definitely takes the cake.

718
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,620
Don't worry. Once
Luisa meets us,

719
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,450
you can enjoy
the festivities.

720
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,160
Wait!
<b></b>
(Latin Lover Narrator gasps)

721
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,460
Does Alba know it's Jane?

722
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,830
May I have a drink?

723
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,340
Let's go.

724
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,970
Where's Jane?

725
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,510
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
She's right over there!

726
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,800
Somebody help her!

727
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,060
I don't know.

728
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,810
Thought she'd be here
by now. Maybe...

729
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,310
maybe she's running late.

730
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,230
She said she was planning
some big surprise for me.

731
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,310
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Look right, Rafael!

732
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,230
Hey, so what'd you decide
about the funeral?

733
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,230
I sent flowers and a note
to J.R. You were right.

734
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,990
I didn't want to go
for the right reasons.

735
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,610
I'm sorry.

736
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,200
But you know
you'll fall in love again.

737
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,450
It's only a matter of time.

738
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,910
Maybe.

739
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,250
Or maybe I'm just not meant
to couple up.

740
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,620
Maybe it's not my destiny.

741
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,380
I have a great life
without a partner.

742
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,550
And honestly,
the Marbella satisfies me

743
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,800
in a way I don't think
a lover ever could.

744
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,170
I am so glad we got divorced.

745
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And I'm so glad
this conversation is over,

746
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,640
because Jane is in danger!

747
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,140
Come on, Rafael.

748
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,020
If anyone is going to realize

749
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,850
it's Jane inside that costume,
it's her true love.

750
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,310
So...

751
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,860
did you think about moving in
to the Marbella?

752
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,150
Um... I did, actually.

753
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,780
ROSE:
What are you doing?

754
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,120
It's hard for me
to move fast

755
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,120
with this tray
of drinks.

756
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,450
WOMAN:
Help! Save me!

757
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,160
Somebody save me!

758
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,370
On Mars, no one
can hear you scream.

759
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,420
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh, smart! A secret signal.

760
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,300
He can't hear you,
but he can see you.

761
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,050
ROSE:
What are you doing?

762
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,720
Why are you slowing down?

763
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,520
Sorry, this costume's heavy.

764
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,520
(groans)

765
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,570
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, no.

766
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,360
Where is she taking her?

767
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,950
Think of something, Jane!

768
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,950
Wow. You move fast
for a 51-year-old.

769
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,700
What did you say?

770
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,490
No, I'm just impressed.
That's all.

771
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,750
I am not 51.

772
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,250
That's ridiculous.

773
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,920
That better not
be in your book.

774
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,710
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Did he see her?
He's so far away,

775
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,510
and it's so dark up here.
I can't tell.

776
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,310
Esteban Santiago,
you were a red carpet dynamo!

777
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,360
Wasn't it amazing?
<b></b>
It really was.

778
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,440
For the first
time in my life,

779
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,900
I felt like the star
I was born to be.

780
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,950
So you'll come to New York?
<b></b>
No.

781
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,370
What do you mean, "No"?

782
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,790
Tonight was great, which clearly
you had something to do with.

783
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,370
(muffled snort)
<b></b>
But it wouldn't feel
like this in New York.

784
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,790
This kind of
treatment is reserved

785
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,290
for the stars of the show.

786
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,630
I'd just be a measly
recurring character.

787
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,090
It's not like I'd be
the lead or the villain.

788
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,380
You want to be the villain?
You can be the villain.

789
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,930
You're already the villain
in my life, so it's perfect.

790
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,590
No. Forget it.
It was a bad idea.

791
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,050
America will hate me.

792
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,810
But they will love
to hate you, like I do.

793
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,640
And all telenovelas
need villains.

794
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,190
You'll have an incredible arc

795
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,020
with huge twists and turns
all leading up

796
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,070
to our epic confrontation

797
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,030
with both our lives
hanging in the balance.

798
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,360
Huh. If Luisa doesn't show up,

799
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,240
you're gonna have plenty
of room on your side

800
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,240
of the wedding aisle.
You know, I think I'll take

801
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,950
your daddy out first.
<b></b>
Shut the hell up, Rose.

802
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,120
Just shut the hell up!

803
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,830
You know what?
I'm not scared

804
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,790
of you anymore.
I'm just freaking sick of you.

805
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,210
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Jane, stop!

806
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,420
You're going
to get yourself killed.

807
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,840
I tell my son every night

808
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,300
that monsters aren't real.

809
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,840
But they are.
I'm looking at one.

810
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,630
But you'll never win.

811
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
So, wait. We are gonna do
the speech now?

812
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,510
Because you know
what else I tell him?

813
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,140
Good always triumphs over evil.

814
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,520
You're right, sweetheart.

815
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,230
I am evil, and I'm about to...

816
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,480
(both grunting)
<b></b>
Yes.

817
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,320
Classic telenovela move:
distract the villain

818
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,480
to buy more time.

819
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,070
Run! Go!

820
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,490
One more step, and Jane is dead.

821
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,450
You know,
now that Rafael is here,

822
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,160
I don't really
need two hostages.

823
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,450
So you're disposable.

824
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,460
Oh, Jane, cheer up.

825
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,130
You'll probably sell
more books this way.

826
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,790
LUISA:
Let them go!

827
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,010
I won't go anywhere with you
if you touch them.

828
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,220
ROSE:
No problem.

829
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,090
I knew you'd come.

830
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,010
I told you.

831
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,810
Ours is the greatest

832
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,890
love story ever told.

833
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,810
It might be.

834
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,810
But it ends now.

What?

00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,740
Wh-What is that?

Cyanide.

00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,200
My family will never be safe

838
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,070
until I'm gone.

839
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,580
No, Luisa! Don't.

Was that a...

00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,300
Tic Tac?

846
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,640
Wintergreen.

You're in

Oh! Fire! (yells)

Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, that definitely did.

856
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,540
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You'll recall our heroine

857
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,960
finally vanquished our villain.

858
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,880
How are you feeling, Janie?

859
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,550
Relieved. And guilty
for feeling that way.

860
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,300
No way. Remember
how we all cheered

861
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,010
when Catalina Creel died?

862
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,310

Yeah. I am.

Hey, Lily. Uh, look,
about yesterday...

No, no.

I heard your lawyer
loud and clear.

Didn't quite need
her attitude.

Yeah, sorry about
that. I fired her.

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Literally.

871
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,910
The point is,
I turned down the 25 K.

872
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,540
I thought about it,
and the only way

873
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,000
to get what you want is
to put the book up for auction.

874
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,550
I've asked for first offers
by 3:00 p.m. today.

875
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,670
Oh, wow.
Uh, but isn't that, uh...?

876
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,380
Risky? Yes.

877
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,550
So I want to prepare you.
We could get a lot of bids,

878
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,930
or we could get none at all.

879
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,600
But you said
you want to roll the dice,

880
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,180
so be by your phone at 3:00 p.m.

881
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,430
Keep your fingers crossed.

882
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,940
Everything okay?

883
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,690
I just hope Rose
didn't ruin my one chance

884
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,940
at selling my book.

885
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,730
You would have taken
the 25,000?

886
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,440
No, I wouldn't have.

887
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,610
But it'd be easier to blame
Rose if it doesn't sell.

888
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,950
So...

889
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,280
have-have you made
your decision?

890
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,410
Yes, he has.

891
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,540
I will take the part of
the incredibly handsome villain,

892
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,630
and Darci, Baby and I
will move to New York.

893
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,000
Yes.

894
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:03,380
(laughing):
Yes!

895
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,590
Oh, my God!

896
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,510
You won't regret this.

897
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,810
I promise you won't. Thank you.

898
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,360
(screaming)
<b></b>
(laughing)

899
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,150
You did it, Smush!
<b></b>
Yeah!

900
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,440
I knew you could get a
giant part on his show!

901
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,490
I know! How great an actor am I?

902
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,660
I mean, the Reiki?
A higher calling than acting?

903
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,330
(laughs)

904
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,160
Put on your spacesuit, Mush.
We're going to Mars!

905
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,960
Oh!
<b></b>
Ah! Mmm!

906
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,790
It's from India.

907
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,710
I hope you like it.

908
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,430
Thank you... for
saving our lives.

909
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,100
Oh... (scoffs)

910
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,760
It was...
it was no big deal. I...

911
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,270
I couldn't let anything happen
to you before your big day.

912
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,980
We'd... really like you
to be there, actually.

913
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,360
What?

914
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,650
Come to our wedding.

915
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,950
Please?

916
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,530
I would love that.

917
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,790
Thank you.

918
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,620
(sniffles)
Oh, my God.

919
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,210
Have you thought
about the honeymoon?

920
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,750
Because one benefit
of hiding out

921
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,580
with an international
crime lord--

922
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,380
you had to know a lot
of secluded spots.

923
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,260
Oh, I don't think
we'll honeymoon.

924
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,180
Raf is so busy with work
at the Marbella.

925
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,140
Well, actually,
I quit last night.

926
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,600
What? I thought
the Marbella was your dream.

927
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,770
It was, but like
I told Petra,

928
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,940
my dream has changed.

929
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,530
I want time with my family.

930
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,240
So, I'm gonna keep
my real estate job,

931
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,240
and we'll save, buy a
little house down the line.

932
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,740
(laughs)

933
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,160
Yeah?

934
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,950
And you're okay with that?

935
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,080
A... a little house?

936
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,500
A smaller life?

937
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,840
Doesn't feel smaller at all.

938
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,880
(crying): Oh, my God, Raf,
you've grown up so much.

939
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,720
(laughs)

Aw.

940
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,260
I...

(laughs)

941
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,510
I can't wait
for your wedding, you guys.

942
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,140
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Me, neither, but before
we get to the wedding,

943
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,930
we have front-row seats
at an auction.

944
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,770
Ah, what if nobody bids?

945
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,310
Uh, what if
my book doesn't sell?

946
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,730
Just take a deep breath.

947
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,110
It's gonna be okay.

948
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,110
(phone chimes)

949
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,570
First offer came in.

950
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,160
10,000.

951
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,040
Okay. Uh, we got one.

952
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,920
(sighs)
<b></b>
Hey.

953
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,420
10,000-- it's nothing
to sneeze at.

She turned down 25.

956
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,340
20,000.

957
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,630
Okay, we're
in the game.

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,180
30! Oh, uh, thank you,

faceless publisher,
whoever you are.

961
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,560
Now I don't feel like
such an idiot

962
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,350
for not taking that 25.

Fist bump on that.

963
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,690
Yup.

Yep. I just wanted

100. (laughs)

972

One hundred...

973
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,090
thousand... dollars!

Uh, yes. Hi. Yes.

The auction's over.

983

500.

thousand.

You did it, Jane.

989
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,210
You did this.

990
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,750

And sometimes, friends,

992
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,710
the unexpected can be magical.

993
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,760
So much for a small life.

I know. It's just...

1001
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:39,120
we're not gonna be here
when the first check comes

1002
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,370
or when the book
is published.

1003
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,620
It's finally hitting me.

How do we say goodbye?
