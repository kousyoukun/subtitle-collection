1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,187
<i>Friends, we're
almost at the end.</i>

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,767
<i>And our Jane was approaching
the finish line as well.</i>

3
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:07,727
<i>That's right,
she had finished her novel.</i>

4
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:09,446
<i>You know, the one
based on her life.</i>

5
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:11,282
<i>Oh, and she got herself
an agent.</i>

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,509
- Yes!
- <i>And in more good news...</i>

7
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,985
<i>Rogelio's pilot</i> This Is Mars
<i>got picked up to series.</i>

8
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:19,001
<i>Unfortunately,
River Fields decided</i>

9
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,373
- <i>to move the show to New York.</i>
- For my family.

10
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:23,014
What about my family?

11
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:24,681
<i>And speaking of giant moves,</i>

12
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:26,768
<i>Rafael started working
for Petra,</i>

13
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:29,414
<i>and Petra was determined
to expand the Marbella.</i>

14
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:32,477
I want a Marbella in every
major city, on every continent.

15
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,309
<i>Might as well dream big, right?</i>

16
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:37,780
<i>But not everything was dreamy.
Remember our evil villain Rose?</i>

17
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:40,420
<i>The one who kidnapped Mateo
and gave Michael amnesia?</i>

18
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:43,201
<i>Well, Jane was determined to
confront her once and for all.</i>

19
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:45,118
If I can just say
my piece to her,

20
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,621
I really think
I'll be able to move on.

21
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:47,951
<i>Only problem...</i>

22
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:52,011
- Run!
<i>- Because of Luisa,</i>

23
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:53,511
<i>we were able to uncover Rose's</i>

24
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:56,023
<i>escape plan and send in a team
to capture her.</i>

25
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:57,181
You're under arrest.

26
00:00:57,268 --> 00:00:59,313
- Luisa betrayed me?
- Police!

27
00:00:59,468 --> 00:01:02,490
<i>Unfortunately,
things didn't go as planned,</i>

28
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:03,959
and she escaped again.

29
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:05,309
<i>Which, I'm afraid,</i>

30
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:07,188
<i>is where we left off.</i>

31
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,860
<i>Friends, after our
Jane Gloriana Villanueva</i>

32
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:12,151
<i>heard the news...</i>

33
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,481
Rose escaped.

34
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:15,938
<i>Well, everything changed.</i>

35
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,279
We don't know
where she is,

36
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:19,836
but Luisa's on her way
to a safe house in Belize.

37
00:01:19,924 --> 00:01:21,588
We feel certain she will
try to contact her.

38
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:24,383
- So my sister is bait?
- Oh, she insisted.

39
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:27,266
She wanted to keep Rose away
from you and your family.

40
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:30,695
<i>And, well, from that moment on,</i>

41
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:35,156
<i>our Jane was living
in a constant state of anxiety,</i>

42
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,531
<i>so her family stepped in
to help her cope.</i>

43
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:41,287
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

44
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:43,341
<i>But despite their best efforts,</i>

45
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:46,492
<i>our Jane remained traumatized.</i>

46
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:52,771
<i>Always on edge.</i>

47
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:57,111
<i>Afraid of what was lurking
around the corners,</i>

48
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:58,435
<i>in the shadows.</i>

49
00:01:58,557 --> 00:02:00,701
Yeah, it was the
air conditioner.

50
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:03,474
I checked, no one
is outside.

51
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:05,654
Are you okay?

52
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:08,646
No. I hate
living like this.

53
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:10,701
I know.

54
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:15,521
Maybe it's time for you
to get professional help.

55
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:20,748
<i>But
after talking and talking...</i>

56
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,138
I just can't talk anymore.

57
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:25,178
I know, logically,
Rose isn't coming,

58
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:28,068
but I can't shake this
feeling that there's

59
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:31,178
something horrible
just around the corner.

60
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:33,811
- Which is no way to live.
- Exactly.

61
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:36,151
And I need to figure out
how to manage my anxiety.

62
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:38,754
I think maybe
you should try tapping.

63
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:40,286
<i>I don't think tap dancing</i>

64
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:41,451
<i>is going to solve this problem.</i>

65
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:45,318
One of the branches of therapy
I offer is EFT.

66
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,779
It's a self-soothing tool,
based in acupuncture.

67
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:52,279
<i>Well,
that makes much more sense.</i>

68
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,740
Every time you feel anxious,

69
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,584
just tap along these meridians.

70
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:04,478
<i>Which brings us here.</i>

71
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:07,928
Is it working?
A little.

72
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:10,981
Maybe? I have to remember
the tapping pattern,

73
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:14,431
so that at least takes my mind
off of Rose. How was your day?

74
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:15,938
Ugh, stressful.

75
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:17,938
Petra keeps calling,
e-mailing and texting me

76
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:19,271
every two seconds.

77
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,271
She even had me paged
at the gym.

78
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:23,361
I can hardly use the
bathroom without her...

79
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,611
Relax, it's my phone.

80
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:29,948
Maybe you should
start tapping.

81
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:32,001
Ooh, it's my agent.

82
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,373
You love saying that.

83
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,568
I really do.

84
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:36,576
I should talk to my agent.

85
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:38,620
Hey, Lily.

86
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,541
Okay, Jane, listen, I have news.

87
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:41,791
Okay.

88
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:43,298
Good news or bad news?

89
00:03:43,388 --> 00:03:44,511
<i>In case you forgot,</i>

90
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,631
<i>Jane is not a fan
of unexpected news.</i>

91
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:49,968
Oh, sorry. Sometimes I forget
how anxious you writers are.

92
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:51,641
<i>Especially
a writer whose villain</i>

93
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,021
<i>just broke out of prison.</i>

94
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,641
It's good news.
Publishers are loving your book.

95
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:57,864
Oh, my God, really?

96
00:03:57,952 --> 00:03:59,006
Really.

97
00:03:59,094 --> 00:04:00,365
A couple editors
want to meet you,

98
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:01,722
so I'm setting some lunches.

99
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,153
Lunches?
Okay, sounds good.

100
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,318
Sure does.

101
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,357
I think you're gonna get
a good offer, Jane.

102
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:08,256
Wow.

103
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,570
That's great. Thank you.

104
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:13,241
Yes, talk to
you soon. Bye.

105
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:16,942
People like my book, and she
thinks I'm gonna get an offer.

106
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:19,881
A good one, she said.
What does that mean?

107
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,168
I don't know! I mean,
I would be happy with 25,000,

108
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:24,171
you know?
Thrilled with 50.

109
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:26,421
100 would be... too crazy.

110
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:29,341
I'd never get that, but can you
imagine if I got $50,000?

111
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:32,348
Oh, and guess what else.
They want to take me to lunches.

112
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,851
Multiple, fancy,

113
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:35,930
free lunches! Ooh!

114
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:39,166
<font color=#FF00FF>*JANE THE VIRGIN*</font>

115
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,736
<font color=#FF00FF>*JANE THE VIRGIN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 05  Episode 17</font>

116
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:47,642
Episode Title :
<font color=#FFFF00>"Chapter Ninety Eight"</font>

117
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:50,198
So, I have
some good news.

118
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,081
<i>Oh,
looks like Jane already called her mom.</i>

119
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,531
What's going on?

120
00:04:53,618 --> 00:04:56,121
I got into a nursing program
in New York,

121
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:58,145
so we can move there,

122
00:04:58,238 --> 00:04:59,790
if we decide to.

123
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,791
<i>Oh, different news.</i>

124
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:03,881
- That's great.
<i>- Is it?</i>

125
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:05,211
<i>I'm mixed on this whole</i>

126
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:06,801
<i>Ro-and-Xo-move-to-New-York
thing.</i>

127
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:09,218
I'm just so mixed
on this whole

128
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:10,631
move-to-New-York thing.

129
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:13,771
I know, but at least
one roadblock is removed.

130
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,308
Hmm.

131
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:21,118
Aw.
Mm.

132
00:05:22,568 --> 00:05:24,561
So, should we talk
to Jane about it yet?

133
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:28,571
No. She has enough on her mind
with all the Rose trauma.

134
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:30,821
I-I don't want to get
into it until we know

135
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:33,661
if Darci and Esteban are even
willing to move with Baby.

136
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:35,791
Then we'll know
if we're actually going.

137
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:38,677
Okay.

138
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:41,450
Maybe we should try, uh,
Jane's tapping technique.

139
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:45,521
Oh, good. You're here.

140
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:48,472
- How was the open house?
- Well, there were two clients

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,764
that wouldn't really
leave even though

142
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:50,824
- they...
- That was a courtesy question.

143
00:05:50,912 --> 00:05:52,879
I don't care. Look, Clarissa
and her financial group

144
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,675
love this property
for our first franchise.

145
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:55,981
The building needs
to be razed,

146
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:57,601
but what about that view?!

147
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,405
We should go see it ASAP.
When can you travel?

148
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,895
Oh! Petra, I... I can't, you know,
with Rose out there, and...

149
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,401
Oh. Yeah.
No, I get it. I'll go.

150
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:06,998
Y-You can make
the time up later.

151
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:09,058
Obviously, there are
so many international hurdles

152
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:10,466
we'll have to deal with
since it's a British

153
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:12,451
overseas property,
but we'll chip away at them.

154
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,251
Hopefully, we can close
the deal in 12 months.

155
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:16,701
Yeah. That sounds great.

156
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:18,701
You seem overwhelmed.

157
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,155
I am... a little.

158
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:23,675
Well... I get it.

159
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:25,253
You're working two jobs.

160
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,881
I know we had our worries
about working together,

161
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:30,115
but things have been going
really well between us.

162
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:35,498
So why don't we fully commit
to this partnership? Hmm?

163
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:37,584
Quit your real estate
agent thing.

164
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,404
Let's go all in.

165
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,361
<i>What did you say?</i>

166
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:43,388
I said, "That makes sense."

167
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:46,240
The thing is,
I'm torn about quitting. Why?

168
00:06:46,328 --> 00:06:48,038
There'll be a lot
of stress and travel

169
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,873
and risk involved
with no guaranteed payoff.

170
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,781
I mean, I could
spend years

171
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:52,991
negotiating the new franchise,

172
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,693
and then nothing
could come of it.

173
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:56,211
Well, you can't
live in fear

174
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:58,071
of what's coming
around the corner.

175
00:06:58,158 --> 00:06:59,581
Huh. Well, it looks like

176
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,628
somebody's learned a
thing or two in therapy.

177
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:02,834
This is your dream.

178
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,435
Go for it. Be brave.

179
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,240
Hey, that's my line.

180
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,380
Well, it's works, and it's true.

181
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:12,671
Look who's getting
a free lunch tomorrow.

182
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:14,340
I am so proud of you.

183
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:16,795
You're gonna kill it.

184
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:19,850
<i>Ah, friends,
look at Jane, ready to kill it,</i>

185
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:22,401
<i>and by "it," I mean that free lunch.</i>

186
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:24,295
Hey, Lily, uh,
I just got to the restaurant.

187
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:25,716
Oh, wait. I meant to ask you.

188
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:27,722
Should I order
a glass of wine at lunch,

189
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,865
or is that inappropriate?

190
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:30,286
Jane, the editor's not coming.

191
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:31,867
What? Why?

192
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:33,080
We have a problem.

193
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,045
Uh, what is it?

194
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,886
Michael Cordero never
signed away his life rights.

195
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,350
Without his permission,
the book can't be published.

196
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:42,001
<i>Yup.</i>

197
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:46,108
<i>There's always something
unexpected around the corner.</i>

198
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,305
- Michael?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

199
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,696
- <i>None of us were expecting that.</i>
- Yup.

200
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:19,477
And if he won't sign over his
life rights, there's no book.

201
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,344
Well, you have to call him
and convince him.

202
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,852
Yeah. I will.

203
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:27,071
So, I guess I'll just...

204
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,938
call him right now.

205
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,039
I have the number
to the ranch.

206
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:35,298
Rick?

207
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:36,860
It's the ranch foreman.

208
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,701
Um, uh, yeah, hi.

209
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,030
I-I'm looking for
Michael... or Jason.

210
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:42,702
Michael-Jason.

211
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,384
Oh. Really?

212
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,635
Okay. Thank you.

213
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:49,341
So, I guess Michael
took off a few days ago.

214
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,478
Rick suggested I try
calling his mom.

215
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:54,481
<i>Can't the
guy just get a freaking cell phone?</i>

216
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:57,358
So I'll just... call her now.

217
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,020
Voice mail.
Hmm.

218
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,691
Hi, Patricia. It's Jane.

219
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:04,941
Uh, can you please
give me a call back

220
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,096
when you have a chance?

221
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:08,081
Thank you. Hope all is well.

222
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:11,112
Okay. So, hopefully,
she'll call back,

223
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:12,807
- and then we'll just...
- Rafael!

224
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:14,642
Sounds like
she needs you.

225
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,939
I have to get ready
for my shift anyway.

226
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:21,341
Krishna! Pull up the preliminary
inspection reports

227
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,598
on the Turks and Caicos property
to show Rafael.

228
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:27,609
What were you looking at?
Nothing.

229
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:28,971
I'll remind you
of the Marbella's

230
00:09:29,058 --> 00:09:31,072
"no porn, no TMZ, no Goop"
Internet policy.

231
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,460
<i>Whew! I would not last there.</i>

232
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:36,721
<i>Is that...?</i>

233
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,478
- J.R.'s mother?
- I'm sorry.

234
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,900
I promise I wasn't stalking
your ex-girlfriend.

235
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:43,385
That would be creepy.
I just love obits.

236
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:45,353
<i>'Cause that's not creepy.</i>

237
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:56,319
Oh. I guess
J.R. will be in town.

238
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:58,143
You okay?

239
00:09:58,338 --> 00:09:59,581
Yeah. fine.

240
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,776
Krishna, let's see
those reports.

241
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,551
- What's this?
- All the reasons why

242
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,678
moving to New York would be
incredible for you and Baby.

243
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,703
God, you're a slow reader.
Let me just tell you.

244
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,502
Did you know that New York
has the most single people

245
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,560
per capita
in the entire country?

246
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:20,235
<i>Ooh.</i>
I<i> should move there.</i>

247
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:23,440
And that single women outnumber
single men almost two to one?

248
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:24,727
<i>Never mind.</i>

249
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:27,593
Those lonely souls need you
and your matchmaking skills.

250
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:31,373
Oh... Also, New York has
the best pizza in the world!

251
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:34,679
Plus, everyone is rude there,
and you love being rude.

252
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:38,576
And have I mentioned
Alexandria Ocasio...?

253
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:40,291
Rogelio, stop.

254
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,758
You do remember
I'm from New York, right?

255
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:43,928
I would actually

256
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,211
love to move back there.

257
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,172
Really?
You would?

258
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,164
But Esteban.
He loves Miami.

259
00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:53,695
The bozo even thinks Miami
pizza's the best in the world.

260
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:56,601
<i>Yeah, Esteban.</i>

261
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,221
<i>Gonna have
to disagree with you.</i>

262
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,111
Hi, Jane.

263
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:04,811
Hi, Patricia.
Thank you for calling back.

264
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,448
Uh, I didn't mean to bother you,

265
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:07,901
but I'm trying
to track down Michael.

266
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:09,231
Do you know where he is?

267
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:10,651
I do, actually.

268
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,400
<i>Hi, Jane.</i>

269
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:16,539
Oh, uh, Michael, hi.

270
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:20,081
I... I didn't know
you were in Florida.

271
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:23,531
Yeah. I am.

272
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:27,138
Uh, anyway,
I-I'm sorry to bug you,

273
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:29,138
but I wanted to talk to you
about my novel.

274
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:30,405
You probably didn't get it,

275
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,446
but my agent sent over paperwork
for you to sign.

276
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:34,265
Oh, I got it. I just...

277
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:36,257
didn't sign it. Um...

278
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:38,178
I wanted to talk to you
in person.

279
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:39,819
Which is actually
why I'm in town.

280
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:42,089
Uh...

281
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:44,210
So, what do you think?

282
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:46,140
You have to meet him.

283
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:49,085
- It's your book.
- I know, but...

284
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:52,616
He's making the effort to drive
all the way down here to see me.

285
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,733
I-I'm worried
it's not just about the book.

286
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,544
Well, I obviously don't think
it's about the book, either.

287
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,601
I think he wants
to try to win you back.

288
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,461
But I'm not worried about that.

289
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,054
Good.

290
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,020
Because I love you so much.

291
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:09,961
I love you, too.

292
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:12,663
Now go get those
life rights.

293
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,772
Thank you for understanding.

294
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,943
<i>You're welcome.</i>

295
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:19,106
Someone just got you
a recurring role

296
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:22,390
on<i> This Is Mars.</i>
You are back, baby!

297
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:27,691
Biggest acting opportunity
of your life!

298
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:28,892
No, thanks.

299
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,730
What? Why?

300
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,374
I've decided to quit acting.

301
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:36,532
I've gotten really
into aromatherapy and Reiki.

302
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,490
I'm committed to
being a spiritual

303
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,878
and physical healer
of bodies and souls.

304
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,911
<i>Oh, so that's
why he's dressed like my yoga teacher.</i>

305
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:45,968
I have a higher
calling now.

306
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:48,045
I truly want to help people.

307
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:52,364
But why help a few scrawny
unwashed vegans

308
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:55,758
when you can reach millions
of normal people

309
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:57,341
by entertaining them?

310
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:59,181
I get great satisfaction

311
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:02,181
out of my one-on-one
interactions with my clients.

312
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:05,768
Esteban, please, I will have to
give up on my dream

313
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:09,905
if you won't move to New York,
because I cannot leave Baby.

314
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:12,070
I wasn't a part
of Jane's childhood,

315
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,578
and I won't make
that mistake again.

316
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,411
Wow.

317
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,335
What a tremendous gesture
of love.

318
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:20,921
Baby is truly
blessed to have

319
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:22,958
a beautiful person for a father.

320
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,100
It was a beautiful plan,
but it backfired.

321
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:29,710
I don't know what to do
about Esteban now.

322
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:31,842
He's become a completely
different person.

323
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:34,428
Then you have to remind him
of who he was,

324
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,684
of what inspired him
to become a telenovela actor

325
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:37,971
in the first place.

326
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:39,431
Just think,

327
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:41,471
what would remind you

328
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:43,528
of why you love acting?

329
00:13:47,822 --> 00:13:49,887
Me.

330
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:53,714
<i>And speaking of telenovelas...</i>

331
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:02,431
Hi, Jane.

332
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,441
It's so nice to see you.

333
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,941
And Bo.

334
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:14,584
Nice to see you, too.

335
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,686
Uh...

336
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,264
So, you wanted to talk
about the book in person?

337
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,615
Yeah. Um, we're not
totally okay with it.

338
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:27,045
You and Bo?

339
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:29,733
No, uh, me and my fiancée.

340
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,437
<i>If
he's trying to win Jane back,</i>

341
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:34,303
<i>this is a weird way to do it.</i>

342
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:36,405
You're marrying Charlie?

343
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:38,483
But she hates you.

344
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:41,451
Yeah, well, not anymore.

345
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:43,329
<i>Guess it's a shotgun wedding.</i>

346
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:47,834
Wow.

347
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:49,076
Congratulations.

348
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:50,900
I am so happy for you guys.

349
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:52,398
Thanks.

350
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:54,571
Now, let's talk about this book.

351
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:57,901
I read it. I don't like it.

352
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,834
Uh, okay. Why?

353
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:03,787
Why? 'Cause Michael's
all over the damn thing.

354
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:05,876
We live a quiet life.
We like our privacy.

355
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:07,957
And frankly, this little book
of yours seems like

356
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:09,335
it's gonna be
a big headache for us.

357
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:11,865
So I don't want Michael
signing that paperwork.

358
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:13,834
Please?

359
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,231
Th-This book means
so much to me,

360
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:19,434
and I've worked so hard
on it... uh, for years.

361
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:21,261
Sorry about that.

362
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:23,261
You're a writer.
Write another one.

363
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,170
Michael, please?

364
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,271
This is a family decision, Jane,

365
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:33,408
and I support
whatever Charlie wants.

366
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,911
Well, this damn baby's
sitting on my bladder again.

367
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:42,746
So, I better

368
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:45,201
hit the commode,
as y'all like to say down here.

369
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,588
<i>Uh, no one says that.</i>

370
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:50,870
Please? Okay,
is there anything I can do?

371
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,591
Does she want
more prize chickens?

372
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:54,291
No. I asked.

373
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:57,211
Look, I-I feel real
bad, but, you know,

374
00:15:57,465 --> 00:15:59,598
Charlie is my fiancée and
the mother of my child,

375
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,652
and if she's uncomfortable
with all this,

376
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,051
there's nothing I can do.

377
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:04,691
<i>I know you said no,</i>

378
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:06,045
but I have something
to show you

379
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,402
that might change
your mind about acting.

380
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,111
Rogelio, I have a sound
bath in ten minutes.

381
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:11,637
I'll be quick.

382
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,728
They're all... me.

383
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:06,771
I am an incredible actor.

384
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,692
Yes! I agree.

385
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,371
And you can't throw
all this talent away.

386
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,588
I can, actually.

387
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,999
Why?

388
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:17,841
Because I've played every part.

389
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:19,944
And I stuck the landing
in all of them,

390
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:22,137
not just in
<i>Vault for Your Love.</i>

391
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:23,801
So, why keep acting?

392
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:24,881
What else is there?

393
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:27,207
Great fame in America.

394
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,262
I am about to go
to a premiere party

395
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,358
where my face will be
on every poster,

396
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:33,889
every wall, every tablecloth.

397
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:35,731
Reporters will be
taking my picture,

398
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:38,561
and people will be fainting
when they see me.

399
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:43,022
And it's going to be
the best feeling in the world!

400
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:46,436
Funny. I-I can't even imagine
what that feels like.

401
00:17:46,578 --> 00:17:49,208
Which must
mean I've moved on.

402
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:51,911
<i>Okay, well,
here's another idea.</i>

403
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:53,331
You go through the book,
and any details

404
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:55,100
you're not comfortable with,
I'll take out.

405
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,721
Well, I'm pretty sure
Charlie's uncomfortable

406
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:59,388
with all the details that
have anything to do with me.

407
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:01,749
Michael...
y-you're not being fair.

408
00:18:01,837 --> 00:18:03,439
- I'm not being fair?
- No, you're not.

409
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:05,255
Well, I don't exactly want to be
in this position,

410
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:06,538
'cause I don't want to say no.

411
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,868
Then don't. You know this book
means everything to me.

412
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:10,537
And Charlie means
everything to me.

413
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:14,601
Look, when you left,
I was broken.

414
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:16,691
And Charlie
put me back together again.

415
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:18,101
I know this
sucks, but,

416
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:20,608
you know, I have to choose her
and her feelings.

417
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:22,191
She's my partner.

418
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:23,611
For life.

419
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:26,436
Oh, baby.

420
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,581
All right.

421
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:32,918
We'll sign the
damn papers.

422
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:34,251
Really?

423
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:36,461
- What?
- Yes, really. It's fine.

424
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,291
Well, wait.
Hold on, now.

425
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:40,012
We-we flew all the
way from Montana

426
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,741
so you could tell Jane
all the things you hated

427
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:43,571
about the book,
and now you're fine with it?

428
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:46,037
Michael,
let's take that yes.

429
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:49,850
I didn't come down here
just for the book.

430
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,926
I wanted to see if...

431
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:55,108
y'all still had
anything between you.

432
00:18:56,398 --> 00:18:57,475
I mean,

433
00:18:57,563 --> 00:18:59,473
the way you went on about how...

434
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:02,264
y'all were destined
to be together and how,

435
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,262
when you saw him,
your heart would glow.

436
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:06,195
Didn't exactly go down
like pickle juice.

437
00:19:06,408 --> 00:19:07,928
<i>Very little does.</i>

438
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:09,567
I get it.

439
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:11,209
That was a long time ago.

440
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:15,290
And I do think it was destiny.

441
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:16,569
Now you're not helping.

442
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,606
But I do.
Everything that's happened,

443
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:20,238
all the moments
that led to this...

444
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,831
You two finding each other...

445
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:24,058
It couldn't have happened
any other way.

446
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:27,445
I really believe that
to be true.

447
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,402
What?

448
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:35,506
I asked you once
if you still loved her.

449
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:37,600
You said, "Yes. Forever."

450
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,941
'Cause of what we had once.

451
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:43,365
And 'cause she stuck with me
and helped me find myself again.

452
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:46,541
Which led me to you.

453
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:47,916
Hmm.

454
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:54,793
Geez, she does cry a lot.

455
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,686
See? I told you.

456
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:58,538
So, we're good?

457
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:00,871
No issues with privacy
or anything?

458
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,378
Nah. No one I know would
ever read that book anyway.

459
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,378
Huh. Okay, then.

460
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,848
Oh, but could you just...
leave out

461
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:10,471
this one part
right...

462
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:12,038
there?

463
00:20:12,197 --> 00:20:13,851
<i>And, friends, she did.</i>

464
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:15,505
<i>So I will, too.</i>

465
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:16,938
No problem. It's gone.

466
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,561
Uh... Oh. There's one thing
you got wrong in the book.

467
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:24,735
Um, Rose isn't 38.

468
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,446
- She's 51.
- What? No.

469
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:29,868
She's a plastic surgery
expert, remember?

470
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:31,901
Wow. Okay.

471
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:34,454
I will make that change.

472
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:36,619
Goodbye, Jane.

473
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:40,267
Goodbye, Michael.

474
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:42,278
<i>And this time, friends,</i>

475
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:45,055
<i>it really was goodbye.</i>

476
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:49,789
<i>Don't go.</i>

477
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:53,271
A funeral is the absolute wrong
place to try to win back an ex.

478
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,819
I wouldn't be trying
to win J.R. back.

479
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,623
I'd just be going
to pay my respects.

480
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:58,431
If you really want
to be respectful,

481
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:01,271
then let her mourn
her mother in peace.

482
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:03,600
Yeah, yeah.
You're right.

483
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:06,703
So, have you quit
your real estate job?

484
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,441
- Not yet.
- What? Why?

485
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:13,031
Well, honestly, because
this project is gonna be a lot.

486
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:14,781
And I'd need
to be all in.

487
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,281
And I've already
missed dinners with the kids

488
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:18,281
for the past few weeks,
and I don't want that.

489
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:20,541
I totally get that.

490
00:21:21,117 --> 00:21:22,984
And I think I have a solution.

491
00:21:23,678 --> 00:21:25,086
Move back in to the Marbella.

492
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:27,290
Your old penthouse
is vacant right now.

493
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:29,430
Look, you, Jane, Mateo,
me and the twins.

494
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:32,898
You'd have your whole family
under one very large roof.

495
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:35,461
Plus, you'd have zero commute
and never miss a bedtime.

496
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:37,756
Every night, I get to
put the girls to bed

497
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:39,391
and then come right back
down here and keep working.

498
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:40,971
<i>Lucky you.</i>

499
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:42,656
You're practically
living here already.

500
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,198
Just think about it.

501
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:48,779
Hey, I know you're busy,

502
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:50,231
but give me a call back
when you're done.

503
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:51,742
I have really great news.

504
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,880
Do tell, Jane.

505
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:57,570
What's the great news?

506
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:05,148
I got to say, Jane,

507
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:07,281
I'm a little disappointed.

508
00:22:07,531 --> 00:22:09,781
I was really hoping for Rafael

509
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:12,969
since he's the one who
got me thrown in jail.

510
00:22:13,273 --> 00:22:14,720
But it's fine.

511
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:16,398
You'll do.

512
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:17,866
Aw.

513
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:20,227
You poor little thing.

514
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:22,201
Always in the wrong place

515
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:24,301
at the wrong time, aren't you?

516
00:22:24,828 --> 00:22:27,045
I heard you came
to visit me in prison.

517
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,561
Was there something
you wanted to say?

518
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:31,771
'Cause I'm all ears.

519
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,811
"After everything
you've done to me.

520
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:37,811
"Kidnapping my baby.

521
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,291
"Shooting my husband.

522
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,299
"I think you're
the worst person

523
00:22:41,387 --> 00:22:43,517
in the whole wide world!"

524
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:46,790
Aw.

525
00:22:46,878 --> 00:22:48,321
What's wrong?

526
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:50,130
Cat got your tongue?

527
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:51,875
Or villain got your cat?

528
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:57,557
What do you w-want from me?

529
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:01,704
Wh-What do I w-want from you?

530
00:23:04,713 --> 00:23:06,541
I'm glad you asked.

531
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:12,681
I need Luisa to meet me

532
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,948
at your father's
premiere party.

533
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:17,988
And you're going to help me

534
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:19,471
get her there.

535
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,320
How?

536
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,609
How? How could I do that?

537
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,151
Very good question, Jane.

538
00:23:30,288 --> 00:23:32,031
I was thinking

539
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:35,120
you call her up,
and you say something like,

540
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:37,745
"Ditch the security guards
in Belize,

541
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:41,221
"hop on Pan Atlantic 7859
to Miami,

542
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:43,051
"and meet us at the party,

543
00:23:43,284 --> 00:23:45,461
"or Rose will kill
someone you love.

544
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:47,718
"And if you tell anyone
Rose is holding me hostage,

545
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:49,565
Rose will kill
someone else you love."

546
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:51,533
Yeah, that should work.

547
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,721
Have you got it,
or do you want to practice?

548
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:56,528
P-Please. Please, you
don't have to do this.

549
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:58,198
Pick up the phone and call!

550
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:05,071
Hi. It's Luisa.
It's her voice mail.

551
00:24:05,158 --> 00:24:07,116
Sorry I missed you.
Leave me a message,

552
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:09,071
and I'll get back to you when I can.
Leave a message.

553
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,821
Hi, Luisa. It's Jane.

554
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,351
Rose is holding me hostage,

555
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,236
and she said that if you
don't get on flight...

556
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:19,829
Pan Atlantic 7859.

557
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:23,335
Pan Atlantic 7859 to Miami

558
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:26,761
and meet her at my father's
premiere party, sh...

559
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:29,517
she'll kill someone you love.

560
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,673
And...?

561
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,570
And if you tell
anyone about this,

562
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:39,968
she'll kill another
person that you love.

563
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:41,938
Please, call us back.

564
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:44,165
Aw.

565
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:48,212
Let's hope she does.

566
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:51,132
It would sure be a shame
for someone

567
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,743
to have to die
over an unreturned phone call.

568
00:24:56,303 --> 00:24:59,710
God, Mateo's
gotten so big.

569
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,814
I haven't
seen him since...

570
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:04,591
Oh, well, you remember,
of course.

571
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:07,642
Please, please.

572
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,301
It's an unknown number.

573
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:14,771
It could be her.

574
00:25:14,858 --> 00:25:15,971
Put it on speaker.

575
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,108
Hello?

576
00:25:20,306 --> 00:25:22,311
Jane, it's Lily.

577
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:24,499
Oh. Hi.

578
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:26,481
I just got off the phone
with Little, Brown.

579
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:27,821
They love your book.

580
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:30,651
They're offering you 25,000.

581
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:32,071
Oh, wow.

582
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:33,689
Wow, that's great.

583
00:25:33,985 --> 00:25:35,235
Everything okay?

584
00:25:38,077 --> 00:25:40,564
Yeah, just... processing.

585
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,168
Well, process quickly,
because they need an answer.

586
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:45,131
So, what do you want to do?
Do you want to accept the offer,

587
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:47,091
or do you want to roll the dice
and hold out for a better one?

588
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,196
Here's the kicker: if you wait,

589
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:51,523
Little, Brown could pull their
offer, and there's no guarantee

590
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,608
that another publisher
is gonna step up and...

591
00:25:53,696 --> 00:25:55,116
We're willing to take that risk.

592
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,931
This is Jane Villanueva's
attorney.

593
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:58,811
Call us back
when there's a real offer.

594
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:03,056
We have to keep the line open.

595
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,690
Honestly, Jane,

596
00:26:05,778 --> 00:26:07,009
I just skimmed
your book,

597
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:09,680
but I found it very compelling.

598
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:12,884
I'm flattered that you made me
such a big character.

599
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:16,698
Do you really think
I'm an icy beauty?

600
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:19,371
That was a compliment, Jane.

601
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,048
You could crack a smile.

602
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:37,391
Have some water.
You look parched.

603
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:44,251
It's Rafael. He was supposed to
meet me here before the party.

604
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,028
Tell him to meet you there.

605
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:47,423
And, Jane,

606
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:49,488
if you alert him in any way

607
00:26:49,787 --> 00:26:52,230
or give him any kind
of secret code,

608
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,009
I will kill Mateo.

609
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:01,530
Hey, Raf.

610
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:02,843
Guess where I am.

611
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:04,251
My old penthouse.

612
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:07,046
Oh. What for?

613
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:09,418
Petra offered
to let us move back in.

614
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:11,642
And standing here, I'm just...

615
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:14,432
I'm having
the most intense feeling.

616
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:17,558
About where we started,
where we are now.

617
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,806
Uh, wow, yeah.

618
00:27:22,978 --> 00:27:25,749
Well, it's definitely something
we should talk about,

619
00:27:25,837 --> 00:27:27,238
but can we do it later?

620
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:28,462
Are you okay?

621
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,300
You sound a little off.

622
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:32,781
Y-Yeah, it's all good.
I'm just busy

623
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,781
trying to get ready
for the party.

624
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:36,278
Uh, let's meet there, okay?

625
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:37,278
What?

626
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:38,611
Why? I'm wrapping up here.

627
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,748
I'll be home in... 30 minutes.

628
00:27:40,838 --> 00:27:41,918
No, don't come home!

629
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:43,485
Why? What's going on?

630
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,921
I'm just planning something
for you

631
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:48,758
for the wedding,
and you can't see it.

632
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,791
Oh. Sorry.

633
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,928
But now I kind of want to know
what it is.

634
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:56,675
Yeah. Bye. Love you.

635
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,131
Ah! Okay.

636
00:27:58,371 --> 00:27:59,971
Okay, I'll see you at the party.

637
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:01,714
See you at the party.

638
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:05,458
Well done, you
pretty little liar.

639
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:11,304
Why are you doing this?

640
00:28:12,003 --> 00:28:14,525
Luisa doesn't want to
be with you anymore.

641
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:17,401
That's because you all
have poisoned her against me.

642
00:28:17,878 --> 00:28:19,151
No, it's...

643
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,491
it's because
she doesn't love you anymore.

644
00:28:21,578 --> 00:28:23,738
She does love me.

645
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:25,965
She doesn't.

646
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:28,064
And I know it's
hard and painful,

647
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:29,251
but people fall
out of love.

648
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:30,501
Michael and I did.

649
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:32,494
- This is different.
- How?

650
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:35,121
Because this isn't
your love story, Jane.

651
00:28:35,428 --> 00:28:37,341
It's mine.

652
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:41,089
It's her.

653
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:45,933
Hi, beautiful.

654
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:48,101
I take it you got my message?

655
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:50,007
I'll do whatever you want, Rose.

656
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,374
Just don't hurt anybody.

657
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:53,111
I'm on my way to the airport
right now.

658
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,271
Fantastic.

659
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,828
Yay! We're going to a party.

660
00:28:58,017 --> 00:28:59,498
Should we get dressed?

661
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,469
<i>Wow, they really know</i>

662
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:10,509
<i>how to commit to a theme
and run with it.</i>

663
00:29:10,597 --> 00:29:11,947
There he is, there he is!

664
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:16,314
Esteban, wow!

665
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:18,445
Over here, Esteban!
Look over here!

666
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:19,986
Over here!

667
00:29:20,077 --> 00:29:21,950
Yes, Esteban!
Take one photo.

668
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:24,161
Esteban. Fantastic.
Esteban.

669
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:25,582
Over here, Esteban!

670
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,633
<i>Esteban sure is</i>

671
00:29:27,721 --> 00:29:29,111
<i>working those Estebuns.</i>

672
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:35,181
That's weird.

673
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:37,731
I still haven't heard from Jane.
She should be here by now.

674
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,851
Come on, get out of the way!
Damn it!

675
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:41,345
Those aliens are
in his shot.

676
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:42,556
Move! Move!

677
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,854
<i>Alas, friends,</i>

678
00:29:43,941 --> 00:29:46,283
<i>those aren't just any aliens.</i>

679
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,868
Looking good, guys.

680
00:29:58,178 --> 00:30:00,012
Grab a tray.

681
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:02,407
<i>I know
Jane's had some stressful days</i>

682
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:05,294
<i>as a waitress, but this
definitely takes the cake.</i>

683
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:08,261
Don't worry. Once
Luisa meets us,

684
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,098
you can enjoy
the festivities.

685
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,801
Wait!

686
00:30:11,888 --> 00:30:13,101
<i>Does Alba know it's Jane?</i>

687
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,528
May I have a drink?

688
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:22,028
Let's go.

689
00:30:23,868 --> 00:30:25,270
Where's Jane?

690
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:26,802
<i>She's right over there!</i>

691
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:28,102
<i>Somebody help her!</i>

692
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:29,458
I don't know.

693
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:31,294
Thought she'd be here
by now. Maybe...

694
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:32,559
maybe she's running late.

695
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:34,471
She said she was planning
some big surprise for me.

696
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:36,558
<i>Look right, Rafael!</i>

697
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:38,708
Hey, so what'd you decide
about the funeral?

698
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:41,794
I sent flowers and a note
to J.R. You were right.

699
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,341
I didn't want to go
for the right reasons.

700
00:30:43,428 --> 00:30:44,961
I'm sorry.

701
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,379
But you know
you'll fall in love again.

702
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:50,067
It's only a matter of time.

703
00:30:50,178 --> 00:30:51,450
Maybe.

704
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,661
Or maybe I'm just not meant
to couple up.

705
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:56,032
Maybe it's not my destiny.

706
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,989
I have a great life
without a partner.

707
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,541
And honestly,
the Marbella satisfies me

708
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,441
in a way I don't think
a lover ever could.

709
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,481
I am so glad we got divorced.

710
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:07,861
<i>And I'm so
glad this conversation is over,</i>

711
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:09,919
<i>because Jane is in danger!</i>

712
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:14,041
<i>Come on, Rafael.</i>

713
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:15,668
<i>If anyone is going to realize</i>

714
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:18,356
<i>it's Jane inside that costume,
it's her true love.</i>

715
00:31:18,588 --> 00:31:19,951
So...

716
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,294
did you think about moving in
to the Marbella?

717
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:25,333
Um... I did, actually.

718
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,136
What are you doing?

719
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:29,645
It's hard for me
to move fast

720
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:31,653
with this tray
of drinks.

721
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:33,756
Help! Save me!

722
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,536
Somebody save me!

723
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:39,504
On Mars, no one
can hear you scream.

724
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:46,840
<i>Ooh, smart! A secret signal.</i>

725
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:48,717
<i>He can't hear you,
but he can see you.</i>

726
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:52,468
What are you doing?

727
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:54,139
Why are you slowing down?

728
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:55,970
Sorry, this costume's heavy.

729
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,370
<i>Oh, no.</i>

730
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,559
<i>Where is she taking her?</i>

731
00:32:07,438 --> 00:32:09,328
<i>Think of something, Jane!</i>

732
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,600
Wow. You move fast
for a 51-year-old.

733
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:13,078
What did you say?

734
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,876
No, I'm just impressed.
That's all.

735
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:17,077
I am not 51.

736
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:18,578
That's ridiculous.

737
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,296
That better not
be in your book.

738
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,117
<i>Did he see her?
He's so far away,</i>

739
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:29,265
<i>and it's so dark up here.
I can't tell.</i>

740
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:41,648
Esteban Santiago,
you were a red carpet dynamo!

741
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:43,883
Wasn't it amazing?
It really was.

742
00:32:44,014 --> 00:32:45,828
For the first
time in my life,

743
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:48,326
I felt like the star
I was born to be.

744
00:32:48,414 --> 00:32:50,327
- So you'll come to New York?
- No.

745
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,840
What do you mean, "No"?

746
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:56,211
Tonight was great, which clearly
you had something to do with.

747
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:58,634
But it wouldn't
feel like this in New York.

748
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:00,273
This kind of
treatment is reserved

749
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:01,771
for the stars of the show.

750
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:04,102
I'd just be a measly
recurring character.

751
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,563
It's not like I'd be
the lead or the villain.

752
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,703
You want to be the villain?
You can be the villain.

753
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:11,247
You're already the villain
in my life, so it's perfect.

754
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,230
No. Forget it.
It was a bad idea.

755
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:14,406
America will hate me.

756
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:17,157
But they will love
to hate you, like I do.

757
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,406
And all telenovelas
need villains.

758
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:22,432
<i>You'll have an incredible arc</i>

759
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,660
<i>with huge twists and turns
all leading up</i>

760
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:27,711
<i>to our epic confrontation</i>

761
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,359
<i>with both our lives
hanging in the balance.</i>

762
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:32,742
Huh. If Luisa doesn't show up,

763
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,633
you're gonna have plenty
of room on your side

764
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,635
of the wedding aisle.
You know, I think I'll take

765
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:38,212
your daddy out first.
Shut the hell up, Rose.

766
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:40,094
Just shut the hell up!

767
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:41,480
You know what?
I'm not scared

768
00:33:41,568 --> 00:33:43,306
of you anymore.
I'm just freaking sick of you.

769
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:44,844
<i>Jane, stop!</i>

770
00:33:44,938 --> 00:33:46,342
<i>You're going
to get yourself killed.</i>

771
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,904
I tell my son every night

772
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:48,931
that monsters aren't real.

773
00:33:49,018 --> 00:33:51,305
But they are.
I'm looking at one.

774
00:33:51,393 --> 00:33:53,156
But you'll never win.

775
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,207
So, wait. We are gonna do
the speech now?

776
00:33:55,295 --> 00:33:57,045
Because you know
what else I tell him?

777
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,666
Good always triumphs over evil.

778
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:01,945
You're right, sweetheart.

779
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:04,816
I am evil, and I'm about to...

780
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:07,121
<i> Yes.</i>

781
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,951
<i>Classic telenovela move:
distract the villain</i>

782
00:34:09,038 --> 00:34:10,121
<i>to buy more time.</i>

783
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:11,711
Run! Go!

784
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:15,178
One more step, and Jane is dead.

785
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,101
You know,
now that Rafael is here,

786
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:20,455
I don't really
need two hostages.

787
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:22,345
So you're disposable.

788
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:25,408
Oh, Jane, cheer up.

789
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,611
You'll probably sell
more books this way.

790
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,282
Let them go!

791
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,080
I won't go anywhere with you
if you touch them.

792
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,962
No problem.

793
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,191
I knew you'd come.

794
00:34:36,723 --> 00:34:38,080
I told you.

795
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:40,185
Ours is the greatest

796
00:34:40,273 --> 00:34:43,273
love story ever told.

797
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,650
It might be.

798
00:34:45,908 --> 00:34:47,461
But it ends now.

799
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:49,168
What?

800
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:53,564
Wh-What is that?
Cyanide.

801
00:34:54,023 --> 00:34:55,840
My family will never be safe

802
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,173
until I'm gone.

803
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,009
No, Luisa! Don't.

804
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,261
No!

805
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:09,757
Goodbye, Rose.

806
00:35:14,658 --> 00:35:17,126
Was that a...

807
00:35:17,278 --> 00:35:18,758
Tic Tac?

808
00:35:18,846 --> 00:35:20,501
Wintergreen.

809
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:26,202
You're in
for the most spectacular show

810
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,081
you've ever seen!

811
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:34,602
<i>OMG. I hope that killed her.</i>

812
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,973
Oh! Fire!

813
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,681
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

814
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:40,946
<i>Well, that definitely did.</i>

815
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,385
You recall our heroine

816
00:35:56,473 --> 00:35:58,393
<i>finally vanquished our villain.</i>

817
00:35:58,537 --> 00:36:00,166
How are you feeling, Janie?

818
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:03,947
Relieved. And guilty
for feeling that way.

819
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:06,110
No way. Remember
how we all cheered

820
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,828
when Catalina Creel died?

821
00:36:19,715 --> 00:36:21,760
Yeah. I am.

822
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:26,458
My agent.

823
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:29,234
Hey, Lily. Uh, look,
about yesterday...

824
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:31,697
No, no. I heard your
lawyer loud and clear.

825
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:33,198
Didn't quite need
her attitude.

826
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:35,116
Yeah, sorry about
that. I fired her.

827
00:36:35,204 --> 00:36:36,143
<i>Literally.</i>

828
00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:38,369
The point is,
I turned down the 25 K.

829
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:40,010
I thought about it,
and the only way

830
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,458
to get what you want is
to put the book up for auction.

831
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:45,142
I've asked for first offers
by 3:00 p.m. today.

832
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:48,481
Oh, wow.
Uh, but isn't that, uh...?

833
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:49,799
Risky? Yes.

834
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:52,112
So I want to prepare you.
We could get a lot of bids,

835
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,483
or we could get none at all.

836
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:54,964
But you said
you want to roll the dice,

837
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:56,551
so be by your phone at 3:00 p.m.

838
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,803
Keep your fingers crossed.

839
00:36:59,054 --> 00:37:00,467
Everything okay?

840
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:02,403
I just hope Rose
didn't ruin my one chance

841
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:03,449
at selling my book.

842
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,363
You would have taken
the 25,000?

843
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:06,822
No, I wouldn't have.

844
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,408
But it'd be easier to blame
Rose if it doesn't sell.

845
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:13,307
So...

846
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,909
have-have you made
your decision?

847
00:37:16,178 --> 00:37:19,268
Yes, he has.

848
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,800
I will take the part of
the incredibly handsome villain,

849
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:25,986
and Darci, Baby and I
will move to New York.

850
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:27,317
Yes.

851
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:30,799
Yes!

852
00:37:31,152 --> 00:37:33,285
Oh, my God!

853
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:34,827
You won't regret this.

854
00:37:34,915 --> 00:37:37,592
I promise you won't.
Thank you.

855
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:46,382
You did it, Smush!
Yeah!

856
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,897
I knew you could get a
giant part on his show!

857
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:51,290
I know!
How great an actor am I?

858
00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:55,461
I mean, the Reiki?
A higher calling than acting?

859
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:59,749
Put on your spacesuit, Mush.
We're going to Mars!

860
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:02,808
Oh!
Ah! Mmm!

861
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,132
It's from India.

862
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:07,850
I hope you like it.

863
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:14,882
Thank you... for
saving our lives.

864
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:16,682
Oh...

865
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,491
It was...
it was no big deal. I...

866
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:23,952
I couldn't let anything happen
to you before your big day.

867
00:38:26,201 --> 00:38:29,592
We'd... really like you
to be there, actually.

868
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,858
What?

869
00:38:30,946 --> 00:38:32,467
Come to our wedding.

870
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:35,758
Please?

871
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:38,038
I would love that.

872
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,139
Thank you.

873
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:42,717
Oh, my God.

874
00:38:42,805 --> 00:38:44,298
Have you thought
about the honeymoon?

875
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:46,165
Because one benefit
of hiding out

876
00:38:46,253 --> 00:38:48,214
with an international
crime lord...

877
00:38:48,488 --> 00:38:50,386
You had to know a lot
of secluded spots.

878
00:38:50,474 --> 00:38:52,605
Oh, I don't think
we'll honeymoon.

879
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:55,136
Raf is so busy with work
at the Marbella.

880
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:59,753
Well, actually,
I quit last night.

881
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:03,113
What? I thought
the Marbella was your dream.

882
00:39:03,312 --> 00:39:07,392
It was, but like
I told Petra,

883
00:39:07,826 --> 00:39:09,628
my dream has changed.

884
00:39:10,212 --> 00:39:12,081
I want time with my family.

885
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:15,448
So, I'm gonna keep
my real estate job,

886
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:19,449
and we'll save, buy a
little house down the line.

887
00:39:21,638 --> 00:39:22,831
Yeah?

888
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:24,355
And you're okay with that?

889
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:26,476
A... a little house?

890
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:27,894
A smaller life?

891
00:39:28,217 --> 00:39:30,467
Doesn't feel smaller at all.

892
00:39:31,514 --> 00:39:35,700
Oh, my God, Raf,
you've grown up so much.

893
00:39:35,788 --> 00:39:37,191
Aw.

894
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:38,987
I...

895
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:41,238
I can't wait
for your wedding, you guys.

896
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:43,574
<i>Me, neither,
but before we get to the wedding,</i>

897
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:46,066
<i>we have front-row seats
at an auction.</i>

898
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:48,377
Ah, what if nobody bids?

899
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:50,488
Uh, what if
my book doesn't sell?

900
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:53,042
Just take a deep breath.

901
00:39:53,637 --> 00:39:55,735
It's gonna be okay.

902
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,428
First offer came in.

903
00:40:01,205 --> 00:40:02,625
10,000.

904
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,891
Okay. Uh, we got one.

905
00:40:07,148 --> 00:40:08,731
Hey.

906
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:10,704
10,000... it's nothing
to sneeze at.

907
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:12,600
<i>She turned down 25.</i>

908
00:40:15,008 --> 00:40:16,436
20,000.

909
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:18,305
Okay, we're
in the game.

910
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,990
30! Oh, uh, thank you,

911
00:40:22,078 --> 00:40:23,743
faceless publisher,
whoever you are.

912
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:25,041
Now I don't feel like
such an idiot

913
00:40:25,128 --> 00:40:26,595
- for not taking that 25.
- Fist bump on that.

914
00:40:26,682 --> 00:40:28,625
Yup.

915
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,766
40.

916
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:35,102
50. OMG, Rafael. 50!

917
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:39,590
Uh, it's Lily. Yeah.
Okay.

918
00:40:39,678 --> 00:40:41,805
Hey, uh, everything okay?

919
00:40:41,893 --> 00:40:44,313
Yep. I just wanted
to tell you this one live.

920
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:47,405
We're at 100,000, Jane.
Got to go. Thank you.

921
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:50,086
100.

922
00:40:50,174 --> 00:40:51,667
One hundred...

923
00:40:51,755 --> 00:40:53,860
thousand... dollars!

924
00:40:57,278 --> 00:40:58,551
Oh.
Oh.

925
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:07,821
Oh. I got it, got it, got
it, got it, got it. Okay.

926
00:41:07,908 --> 00:41:08,961
Jane?

927
00:41:09,048 --> 00:41:10,831
Uh, yes. Hi. Yes.

928
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:12,411
The auction's over.

929
00:41:12,498 --> 00:41:13,911
We got your final offer.

930
00:41:13,998 --> 00:41:15,881
Uh, how much is it?

931
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:17,668
500.

932
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:24,088
Five... hundred...

933
00:41:24,178 --> 00:41:25,758
thousand.

934
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,370
You did it, Jane.

935
00:41:30,437 --> 00:41:31,760
You did this.

936
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,840
<i>And sometimes, friends,</i>

937
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,180
<i>the unexpected can be magical.</i>

938
00:41:37,388 --> 00:41:39,144
So much for a small life.

939
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:42,587
Screw that. We're rich!

940
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:44,925
Ah!

941
00:41:45,685 --> 00:41:48,722
- Can you believe it?!
- That's our girl!

942
00:41:56,917 --> 00:42:00,253
Xiomara, this is good news.

943
00:42:00,548 --> 00:42:03,144
I know. It's just...

944
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:06,605
we're not gonna be here
when the first check comes

945
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:08,644
or when the book
is published.

946
00:42:08,815 --> 00:42:10,978
It's finally hitting me.

947
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:15,730
We're leaving Miami
and moving away from our family.

948
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:19,589
How do we say goodbye?

949
