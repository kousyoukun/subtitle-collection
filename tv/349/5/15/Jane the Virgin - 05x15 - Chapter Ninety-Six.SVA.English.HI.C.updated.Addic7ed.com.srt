1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:01,854
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>Ah,
friends. You'll recall Jane</i>

2
00:00:01,878 --> 00:00:04,144
<i>had been working on her newest
book for quite some time.</i>

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:05,880
I just had an epiphany
about my new book.

4
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,462
I want to turn it into this big

5
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:09,020
multigenerational story

6
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:10,611
with all of the lightness

7
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,532
and all of the darkness.

8
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:13,592
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>And great news:</i>

9
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:15,994
<i>she was getting good feedback
from her mentor Marlene.</i>

10
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,059
I would love to show it to
a friend in the industry.

11
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,851
- Really? That would be...
- Okay,

12
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:22,877
okay, the friend is
actually my lover. (LAUGHS)

13
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:25,002
She's in publishing, and she's a genius.

14
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:26,918
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>And Marlene's
not the only one with a lover.</i>

15
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:28,875
<i>Jane and Rafael were back together.</i>

16
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,564
<i>And he proposed.</i>

17
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,656
- Will you marry me?
- Yes!

18
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:33,959
- (CRYING)
- LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>I know!</i>

19
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:35,749
<i>Heart-eye emojis, right?</i>

20
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:38,374
<i>But in less happy news, their son Mateo</i>

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,299
<i>was having a hard time at school.</i>

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,600
Mateo is really struggling
with his reading.

23
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,425
He is quite far behind
the rest of the class.

24
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,628
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>Oh, and Jane's
dad was struggling, too.</i>

25
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:49,305
<i>See, the fate of his show was
in the hands of the studio.</i>

26
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,663
Barry, I need this pickup.

27
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,643
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>I know!
Straight out of a telenovela</i>

28
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:53,767
<i>inside a telenovela!</i>

29
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:54,797
<i>And speaking of...</i>

30
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,812
<i>remember Rafael's sister Luisa?</i>

31
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:59,304
<i>You know, the one who
was in love with Rose,</i>

32
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,528
<i>aka our supervillain.</i>

33
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:02,486
Thank you for accepting this assignment.

34
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:04,277
Now let's get to work.

35
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:06,884
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>Well, Luisa
swore her off forever,</i>

36
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,243
<i>though recently she seemed</i>

37
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,935
<i>to have had a change of heart again.</i>

38
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,994
I even sent someone to
watch over you. "Girl..."

39
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,752
- Hey, girl, what's up?
- I'm in.

40
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:16,109
What does Rose need me to do?

41
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:17,973
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>Oh, and
I hate to bring this up, but...</i>

42
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:20,686
If you do not help me,
something terrible...

43
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:22,644
- (CRASH)
- LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>I know.</i>

44
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:26,705
<i>I hope Petra's okay. Which
is where we left off.</i>

45
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:29,061
<i>When Jane Gloriana Villanueva</i>

46
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:31,786
<i>was 30 years and six months old,</i>

47
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:34,110
<i>her life changed forever.</i>

48
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,702
She gonna be okay?

49
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:41,161
Yes. Unfortunately.

50
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:42,838
My mother's like a cockroach.

51
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:45,431
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>But
that's a month away.</i>

52
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,979
<i>Right now Jane is 30 years</i>
<i>and</i> five<i> months old.</i>

53
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,704
<i>And this is more of a hassle.</i>

54
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,729
Her leg's pretty screwed
up. She'll be fine.

55
00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:55,102
I'm just happy you're all right.

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,417
You know, when I first
woke up after the crash,

57
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:02,143
my first thought was of the girls.

58
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:04,196
What if I died?

59
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:05,821
Then I realized they'd be fine.

60
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:06,978
'Cause they have Rafael.

61
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:09,690
- And you. As a stepmom.
- Oh...

62
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,779
Don't you start crying.
I'm trying to stop...

63
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:12,870
Too late.

64
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:15,963
I just realized I'm gonna be a stepmom.

65
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:19,923
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>Which
brings us here, now.</i>

66
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:21,388
What's going on?

67
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:23,513
I want to make sure everything is equal,

68
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,882
so the girls feel every
bit as important as Mateo.

69
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:27,181
I also think

70
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:28,717
we should buy two more
chairs for the kitchen table,

71
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,186
so they don't have to
sit on folding chairs

72
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,920
every time they come
over, like they're company.

73
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,405
And I'm gonna spend time

74
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,597
with each of them separately

75
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,031
to really get to know them individually.

76
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,553
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>And
learn to tell them apart.</i>

77
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:39,454
That sounds great, but
where is this coming from?

78
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:40,894
We're getting married.

79
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,497
I'm taking on a new role in their life.

80
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,000
And I want to kill this stepmom thing.

81
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,957
Ooh!

82
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,061
Oh! Oh, my God!

83
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,941
I just realized what I
have to do to fix my novel.

84
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,865
I-I've been trying
to crack this chapter,

85
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,910
and I finally figured it out.

86
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:57,174
I have to rearrange everything.

87
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:58,689
I need to go write!

88
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:00,514
- Go! Go write!
- Oh!

89
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,727
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>And so write she did.</i>

90
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:06,610
<i>Because when the muse struck
Jane, it struck her hard.</i>

91
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:08,513
<i>Pretty much punched her in the face.</i>

92
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:09,738
<i>She</i> had<i> to write.</i>

93
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:11,262
<i>She couldn't stop.</i>

94
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,460
<i>Though life didn't stop around her.</i>

95
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,751
Hey, good news.

96
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:16,497
Petra regained some
mobility in her fingers.

97
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:18,601
She even flipped me off this morning.

98
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:25,660
I just heard the studio loved

99
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:26,751
our<i> This Is Mars</i> pilot.

100
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:27,954
You want to come to
dinner and celebrate?

101
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:30,082
Oh, Dad, I would love to,
but I am on such a roll.

102
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:32,040
Then keep rolling,
my brilliant daughter.

103
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:36,916
Oh, wow. It's sort of smelly in here.

104
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:38,584
- Still in the zone.
- Stay there.

105
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:40,842
I just need to borrow your label maker.

106
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,202
I'm organizing my
nursing school courses.

107
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:44,760
I just registered.

108
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:46,927
This is so good.

109
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:48,252
Okay. I got to go pick up the kids,

110
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:50,443
but I'll read the next
chapter as soon as I get back.

111
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,568
Thank you. Love you.

112
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:04,567
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>And finally...
after three weeks, five pizzas,</i>

113
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:08,294
<i>and one and a half showers,
Jane finished her novel.</i>

114
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,151
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,199
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

116
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,855
Ah... it's awesome.

117
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:29,023
I love... What? What's this?

118
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,507
Uh, my alternate ending.

119
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:33,367
Let me know which one
you think is better.

120
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:34,658
Uh, what's the difference?

121
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:36,534
That comma. It completely changes

122
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,903
the cadence of the last sentence.

123
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:40,325
Okay, I vote no comma.

124
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:44,016
Actually, I might go with the comma.

125
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,307
Okay. It's done.

126
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:48,433
Period. Exclamation point.

127
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,455
Now go send it to Jill.

128
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,825
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>Ah, yes, Jill.</i>

129
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,476
<i>Marlene's publishing friend.</i>

130
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,533
<i>And lover.</i>

131
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:55,690
Okay. Yeah.

132
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,797
It's good, right?

133
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:00,321
I think it's good.

134
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:01,390
But I also feel strange saying that,

135
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:02,493
like, maybe I'm delusional.

136
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:06,084
You're not. It's better
than good. It's great.

137
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,699
Now go take a shower.

138
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:12,724
It's time.

139
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:21,001
Have you heard anything
about your manuscript?

140
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:22,290
Not yet. I'm spiraling.

141
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:23,783
Please don't ask me about it.

142
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:25,454
Okay, well, yesterday you got
mad because I<i> didn't</i> ask.

143
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,378
Yes, I know. Like I said, I'm spiraling.

144
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,032
Wh-What's going on? Distract me.

145
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,310
Can you take the girls
for a few hours today?

146
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,212
Raf's showing a house. I've
got back-to-back meetings,

147
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:34,897
and the nannies have some
god-awful stomach virus,

148
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:36,634
- so they're banned from the Marbella.
- Of course.

149
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:39,459
Yes! I am officially ready
to step into stepmomming.

150
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:41,517
Great. So can I just go over a few rules

151
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,654
I've developed with their therapist?

152
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:44,056
Mother-to-stepmother communication.

153
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,047
I love it. Give me those rules.

154
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:47,805
(CHUCKLES) Most of
it's just common sense.

155
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:49,789
And only one sweet per day.

156
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:51,959
Unless it's Friday. Then they
can have an apple and a sweet.

157
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:53,016

Why? Do you need more guidance?

No. God, no. (CHUCKLES)

Because if they don't,

166

they get manipulative and start to lie.

Looks like the women in the audience

That was a disaster.

What are you talking about?

00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:33,868
The test scores were through the roof.

For those two fetuses, not for us.

If the network sees these scores,

they're gonna want to

- Yes.

This is<i> our</i> show. <i>We're</i> the stars.

and make sure we stand out more.

245
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:54,581
Otherwise, they're gonna turn us into

Really deliberating.

00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,728
I think it was, um, Henry David Thoreau

who said, "To live deliberately,

Jill loved the writing but just
didn't know how to market it,

which means that she just
wasn't the right fit for me,

but there are plenty of
other agents out there,

00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:58,149
Oh, don't worry, I've got it.
I'm just gonna go to Rafael,

318
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:00,151
and I'm gonna beg him for the tie tack.

319
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:01,242
Simple pimple.

320
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,033
Exactly.

321
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:05,492
I wish I could do it.
If I could, I would.

322
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,484
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>And in fact, he tried.</i>

323
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,357
No problem.

324
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:16,593
But why does Rose want
the tie tack? Do you know?

325
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:18,085
One step at a time.

326
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,343
But she does have a plan, right?

327
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:22,668
Rose always has a plan,

328
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:25,093
and the tie tack is phase two.

329
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:29,309
- (SCREAMING)
- ROGELIO: Pause!

330
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:31,877
Okay, that was a very sexy scream,

331
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:33,802
but there was a slight downward turn

332
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:36,293
in the corners of River's
mouth at the end of the shot.

333
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:37,984
Totally true.

334
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,658
Can we trim off about
two and a half frames?

335
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:42,549
Well, yeah, sure, but, look,

336
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:44,981
if you guys want me to
tweak every single frame,

337
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,453
we'll be here all night.

338
00:12:46,478 --> 00:12:47,478
Good point, Mia.

339
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:50,034
Let's check in with our loved ones

340
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:51,671
and tell them it's
gonna be an all-nighter.

341
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:53,228
Geez...

342
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:55,687
What is it, Rogelio? We're
seeing you in less than an hour.

343
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:00,198
ROGELIO: Darci, listen,
what is the one thing

344
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:01,956
in the world you love more than Baby?

345
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,246
When you owe me a favor.

346
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:04,370
Exactly.

347
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:06,429
And, boy, am I gonna owe you a big one.

348
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,153
I'm on a time crunch at work.

349
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:10,106
Can we pretty please swap Baby days?

350
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:11,163
Again?

351
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,422
Esteban is going on a
yoga retreat tomorrow,

352
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:15,048
and tonight was couples time.

353
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:16,205
Darci, please,

354
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,430
my pilot hangs in the balance.

355
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:20,288
(SIGHS) Fine,

356
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:21,747
but I'm not gonna
forget about this favor.

357
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:24,040
Oh, you're a lifesaver. Thank Esteban,

358
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:25,130
and tell Baby I love her.

359
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:28,156
Yeah, yeah, yeah. (GROANS)
Rogelio is such a...

360
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:30,014
Ah, ah, ah.

361
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,356
JANE: <i>Crap.</i>

362
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,314
What's wrong?

363
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:41,172
Uh...

364
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:42,980
just got another rejection letter.

365
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:44,805
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>Geez, it's 7:00 a.m.</i>

366
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,897
<i>Let the girl have a cup of coffee first.</i>

367
00:13:46,922 --> 00:13:49,089
I'm sorry.

368
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,917
I can get off work early
and pick up the girls

369
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:53,075
so you don't have to.

370
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,300
No, no, no, life goes on,

371
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:58,093
and I still have plenty
of agents to hear from,

372
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:01,920
and me and the girls
are making real progress.

373
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:03,306
You tattled on us!

374
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:04,906
ELLIE: That's so lame.

375
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:07,265
New name: Lame Jane.

376
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,891
- No, stop.
- Stop what, Lame Jane?

377
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,682
I only told your mother what happened

378
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,740
because we're all on one team.

379
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,985
Team twins, huh? Go team!

380
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,143
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>Yikes.</i>

381
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:19,600
<i>Pretty lame, Jane.</i>

382
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,224
Snitches get stitches.

383
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:23,016
And end up in ditches.

384
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,941
We don't hang out with narcs.

385
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:28,163
What... Hey, no, girls,
come back here right now.

386
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:31,056
Um, excuse me. Stop it!

387
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,880
My luggage!

388
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,504
Wh... Are you their nanny?

389
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,195
You need to get control of them.

390
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:40,052
Just because I'm Latina doesn't
mean that I'm their nanny.

391
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,377
- Yeah, she's not our nanny.
- Huh.

392
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:45,844
She's our evil stepmother,
and we hate her.

393
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,374
- Hurry up and get ready for dinner, girls.
- So how was it?

394
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:56,908
- Well, not great.
- What happened?

395
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:59,710
What happened is that you
told them what I told you,

396
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,335
and now they think I'm a big tattletale.

397
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,761
NARRATOR: <i>In their defense,
you're tattling right now.</i>

398
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,986
Who cares? This isn't middle
school, it's parenting.

399
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:07,455
You said you weren't gonna say anything.

400
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,939
Well, I changed my mind,
because I'm their mother,

401
00:15:09,964 --> 00:15:11,998
and it's my job to decide
what's best for them.

402
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,500
And, frankly, you
shouldn't have asked me

403
00:15:13,524 --> 00:15:15,992
not to say something in
the first place. Got it?

404
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,983
Fine. Okay. Got it.

405
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:19,208
Thank you.

406
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,233
So any incidents to report today?

407
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,633
Yes, we did have an issue.

408
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:29,787
They ran away because
they were upset with me.

409
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:31,814
Thank you.

410
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,982
Girls, get out here!
Jane told me what you did!

411
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:36,547
NARRATOR: <i>And speaking of
fractured relationships.</i>

412
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,992
Whatever you have to say, I
don't want to hear it. Just go.

413
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:42,550
Wait, wait, wait! I understand
how you feel and why.

414
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,843
And after this, I will
leave you alone forever.

415
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:48,441
But I have no family left,

416
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:51,433
and I just wanted

417
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,892
something small of Dad's before I go.

418
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,305
What is it?

419
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,222
It's this

420
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:01,065
gold and onyx tie tack.

421
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:02,610
It's not worth much,

422
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:04,935
but it's got sentimental value to me.

423
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,527
Dad wore it to my med school graduation,

424
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,350
and I could...

425
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:12,654
I could really use a
reminder of a time in my life

426
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,213
when I was worthy of my
family's love and respect.

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, wow, she's good.</i>

00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,764

429
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:23,589
Well, I, um, I have the tie tack,

430
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:24,981
so you know what I'll do?

431
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:27,306
- What?
- Take it straight to the police,

432
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,026
because if you want it, then it

433
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:30,783
probably has something to do with Rose.

We're popping so much.

We're like a thousand champagne

Okay, now let's send this new tape

to the studio to get to
the network. Girl Rudy,

445
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:31,145
we need you to get the
new cut to the studio ASAP.

446
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,403
Oh, I already did.

447
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,140
What are you talking about?

448
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,925
The network said it
had to be in by 3:00,

449
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,144
so the studio told me to
deliver the latest cut.

450
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:39,669
Why didn't you tell me that?

451
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:41,941
You said never to interrupt you
when you're executive producing.

452
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:43,143
ROGELIO: Call the network right now

453
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,735
and tell them that a
new cut is on the way.

454
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,497
I can't. They're at a corporate
retreat and unreachable.

455
00:17:47,522 --> 00:17:50,088
That's why it needed to be in by 3:00.

456
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,371
That makes three.

457
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:54,968
Three rejections just today.

458
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:56,695
Hey, it only takes one, right?

459
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,654
That's what I keep telling myself,

460
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,946
but I think I need one of Dad's famous

461
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:02,337
"fight for your art" pep talks.

462
00:18:02,477 --> 00:18:04,276
- Ah!
- Oh, good, you're home.

463
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:05,868
Rogelio, tell Jane what it's like

finally getting to work
on your passion project.

Sure. Well, it's, uh, horrible.

467

My career is over. I might as well quit.

468

Why?

469
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,337
Because your daughter needs a pep talk.

470
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,807
She got a few more rejection letters.

471
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,597
Oh, I'm sorry.

472
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:22,221
You have to believe in yourself, Jane.

473
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:24,213
That is the most important thing.

474
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:26,464
The crazy thing is, is I actually do.

475
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:29,217
I think that there is an agent
out there who will love my book,

476
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,281
but my manuscript's not
even getting to their desks.

477
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,244
- How do you know?
- I worked in publishing.

478
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:36,539
I'm getting form letter
rejections from assistants.

479
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:39,649
The last one was addressed
to "Jake Villanuts."

480
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:41,141
(STIFLED LAUGH)

481
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,200
(CLEARS THROAT) H-Have you
heard back from everyone?

482
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,067
Well, not Isabel Allende's agent,

483
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,960
but there's no way that my
book is getting even near her.

484
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:52,252
Unless you get it near her.

485
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:56,076
Did I ever tell you how I got this scar?

486
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,269
I'll make some tea. Remember
your health, Rogelio. Keep calm.

487
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:01,327
Of course. I'm perfectly calm.

488
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:02,885
So, calmly.

489
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,051
When I was a young actor in Mexico City,

490
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:08,598
Alejandro González Iñárritu
was directing a movie about a hobo

491
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:09,989
who through sheer handsomeness

492
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:13,282
becomes the richest
oil tycoon in the world.

493
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:15,407
So I dressed as a homeless man

494
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:19,034
and waited along the route
Iñárritu took every day to work.

495
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,893
Then I saw his car,
so I ran into traffic

496
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:23,717
with a bucket and a squeegee.

497
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:25,396
(GASPS) That's how you got your scar?

498
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:27,388
You got hit by a car
while method auditioning?

499
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,180
No.

500
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:32,973
Iñárritu didn't recognize me
and threatened to call the police.

501
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:34,521
But I didn't give up.

502
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:36,715
The next day, I went to Iñárritu's house

503
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,961
and hand-delivered my headshot
to Iñárritu's girlfriend.

504
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:43,399
She was very nice and invited me inside.

505
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:45,457
Then one thing led to another,

506
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:47,815
and let's just say that
when Iñárritu got home,

507
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,473
I had to jump out the window.

508
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:50,777
And that's how you got your scar?

509
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:53,931
No. I'm incredibly agile
and landed on my feet,

510
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:57,392
right in the middle of
Iñárritu's guard dogs.

511
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,151
- So you were bitten?
- No.

512
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:01,906
I used my incredible
cunning and a little hypnosis

513
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,564
and got away, and then Iñárritu

514
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:05,410
found my headshot under his pillow.

515
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:07,402
- And then you got the part?
- No.

516
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,339
Actually, Iñárritu banned
me from his sets for life.

517
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:13,226
But the rumor of our feud

518
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:16,228
got a ton of coverage
in the Mexican tabloids,

519
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:17,453
and all of that attention

520
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:19,991
got me an audition for
<i>The Passions of Santos,</i>

521
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:22,883
which then launched my career.

522
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:25,686
So you see, Jane, when you have a dream,

523
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:27,577
you never give up.

524
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:29,711
So how did you get the scar?

525
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:31,769
Oh, oh... (CHUCKLES)

526
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:34,227
I cut myself while framing an issue

527
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:35,986
of<i> People en Español</i> about the scandal.

528
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,637
Well, it was the first
time I saw my name in print.

529
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:42,079
I still remember the headline.

530
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:45,932
"Crazed D-Lister Stalks Iñárritu."

531
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:49,776
The point is, I didn't
throw in the towel

532
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:51,243
when things got hard.

533
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:53,044
Hmm. Dad, you just came in here

534
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,401
and said you were giving up,

535
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:55,692
that your career was over.

536
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:57,617
Well, I was wrong. I'm not giving up.

537
00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:59,619
And neither will you, Jake Villanuts.

538
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:01,086
- (SNORTS)
- Now tell me.

539
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,377
How badly do you want

540
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:04,197
your manuscript read by this agent?

541
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,523
I want it with everything that I am.

542
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:08,448
Well, that's all I needed to hear.

543
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:11,132
- I have a plan.
- I am not going to break into

544
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:13,397
the agent's house and put my
manuscript under her pillow.

545
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:17,502
Okay then. I have a plan B.

546
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,535
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>Planning
a covert operation requires</i>

547
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,469
<i>stealth and discipline and...</i>

548
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:26,627
Moo Shu pork, yum. That was fantastic.

549
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:28,505
Okay. Let's synchronize our watches.

550
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,808
And go over the plan one more time.

551
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:31,777
- (WATCHES CLICK)
- The agent leaves

552
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:34,689
at 5:00 p.m. on Fridays
with her weekend reading.

553
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:37,015
At 4:40, you're gonna enter the building

554
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,378
- disguised as a delivery person.
- And I tell security,

555
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:40,742
"I have a package for the fifth floor."

556
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,597
At 4:48, you're gonna
enter the agent's office

557
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:44,112
and you're gonna use your decoy box

558
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,736
to knock over the stack of manuscripts.

559
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,461
And as I help pick up the fallen papers,

560
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:49,292
I slide my manuscript
on the top of her pile

561
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:51,029
- for her weekend reading.
- By the end of the day,

562
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,907
the agent takes your novel home. Boom.

563
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:54,164
Dad, you are amazing.

564
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,534
But the mission isn't accomplished yet.

565
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:56,869
To make it happen by the weekend,

566
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,471
- we have to move quickly.
- Mm-hmm.

567
00:21:58,496 --> 00:22:00,060
(PHONE BEEPS)

568
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,396
Rudy! Get me props, stat.

569
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,522
I also need wardrobe and makeup.

570
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:06,087
My daughter needs a great disguise.

571

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>Wow.</i>

- (RINGTONE PLAYING)
- <i>There she is.</i>

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,529
Hey.

577
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:18,231
Hey. Uh, I booked a last-minute showing

578
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:20,557
that I need to be at,
like, five minutes ago.

579
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:23,527
And I know I said I would
pick up the girls, but I can't.

580
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,620
And the nanny's still sick
and Petra's in a meeting

581
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,375
and I should really be
in there with her and I...

582
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:28,565
It's just, uh,

583
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,390
I'm kind of in the middle
of a business thing.

584
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:33,188
- Wait, what business thing?
- <i>A none-of-your-business thing.</i>

585
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:35,038
Nothing, never mind,
I'll pick up the girls.

586
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:38,123
<i>- No, Jane. What about the plan?</i>
- ROGELIO:<i> Don't worry.</i>

587
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,644
I've got one. Our cut
needs to get to the network.

588
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:42,847
We've worked too hard to get
this project off the ground.

589
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:44,177
My younger self would not

590
00:22:44,202 --> 00:22:45,549
have given up and neither will I.

591
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,640
Agreed. But what does that have to do

592
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:49,485
with... those hideous things?

593
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,544
I found out that every year

594
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,567
the network execs watch all their pilots

595
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,459
at a remote wilderness lodge.

596
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:57,295
No phones, no computers.

597
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,206
- No audience testing.
- <i>But how will they know</i>

598
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:00,782
<i>that straight men like boobs?</i>

599
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:03,032
It's just the top brass
in a screening room.

600
00:23:03,057 --> 00:23:04,400
Totally off the grid.

601
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,478
But...

602
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:07,002
here's the grid.

603
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:08,827
The lodge is here...

604
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:10,783
surrounded by some swamp.

605
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,814
So we'll need waders and camouflage

606
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,939
fishing vests.

607
00:23:13,964 --> 00:23:17,431
<i>The waders will help us to
safely traverse the terrain.</i>

608
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:21,117
<i>And the fishing vests will
have pockets for all our needs.</i>

609
00:23:21,142 --> 00:23:23,691
<i>I wanted to get us
self-destructing burner phones,</i>

610
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:26,308
<i>but Rudy said those aren't
real, so I just got us</i>

611
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,648
<i>regular boring burner phones.</i>

612
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:31,377
We will wade in through the swamp,

613
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:32,834
slip into the screening room

614
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,947
while they're at lunch,
swap out the tape

615
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:37,673
and no one will ever know. Are you in?

616
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:39,464
<i>There is no way in hell she's gonna...</i>

617
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:41,055
I am so in.

618
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,632
<i>Wow. Okay.</i>

619
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:45,291
We cannot let them keep on shifting

620
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:47,716
the focus younger and
younger and younger.

621
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:49,719
- What are we doing here?
- JANE: I just have

622
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:51,798
to make a quick delivery and
then we'll be out of here.

623
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,297
What kind of delivery?

624
00:23:53,322 --> 00:23:55,268
Are you a secret drug runner?

625
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:58,448
No. No, I just... just my book.

626
00:23:58,473 --> 00:24:00,573
And I've been working
on it for the past year.

627
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:02,723
Actually, years. I've
worked on it for years

628
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:04,443
and I need to get it
to somebody to read it.

629
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:06,233
Then what's with the off-brand polo?

630

the one who goes on to win

955
00:37:35,184 --> 00:37:37,419
Teen Choice Awards...

956
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:39,744
the spice, not the dish...

957
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:42,503
so I can enjoy other parts of my life.

958
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,896
Well, that's great. That's just perfect.

959
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:50,022
Oh, come on. Aren't you ready
to slow down, just a little?

960
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:51,414
And focus on what?

961
00:37:51,587 --> 00:37:54,087
It's different for you.

962
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:55,937
You've got these great relationships

963
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:57,360
with your daughters.

964
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:58,476
Whereas mine

965
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:00,701
barely even speaks to me.

966
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:02,633
You have a daughter?

967
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:05,759
Yes. In fact, you've met her.

968
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,050
Excuse me?

969
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:09,179
She's our P.A.

970
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,672
(GASPS)

971
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:14,976
Girl Rudy?

972
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,868
Yeah. PJ.

973
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,025
The P is for Pond.

974
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,408
Pond Juniper Fields.

975
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,764
Why didn't you tell me?

976
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:24,289
She doesn't want people to know.

977
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:26,844
That's why I'm mean to her.

978
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,036
She wants to be treated
like everyone else.

979
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:31,158
Wow, I can't believe it.

980
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,484
Well, it's true. She hates me.

981
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:35,343
That's why I bury myself

982
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:38,135
in my work, so I don't
have to face the fact

983
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,994
that I failed as a mother.

984
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,986
Well, you know what?

985
00:38:44,011 --> 00:38:45,644
I can help you win her back.

986
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:47,769
- No, it's too late.
- Don't say that.

987
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:50,895
I reconnected with Jane
when she was 23 and a half.

988
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,108
And the connection between
a mother and a daughter

989
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:54,907
is so sacred.

990

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>Well... sometimes.</i>

991
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:10,580
Mother, I wish your
life had been easier.

992
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:12,830
And therefore, my life had been easier.

993
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,795
Soon, you'll be in a better place.

994
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,253
<i>Or not.</i>

995
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:20,779
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

996
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:23,513
<i>Did Magda just squeeze her hand?</i>

997
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:26,138
<i>Talk about a death grip.</i>

998
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,895
I'll just sign with the other hand.

999
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,153
Not quite ready to let go.

1000
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,475
C-Can I have a proxy sign for me?

1001
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,867
Jane, Raf? Either one of you?

1002
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:37,091
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

1003
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:38,521
There's activity.

1004
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:40,013
It's a miracle.

1005
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:43,644
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: <i>It's alive!</i>

1006
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,913
We should order flowers.

1007
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:49,454
- For Magda?
- No. For Petra.

1008
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:52,586
<i>I have a suggestion for flowers.</i>

1009
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:55,378
Now that everything is in
place, we can move forward.

1010
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:57,771
Is everyone ready?

1011
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:06,734
<i>How about... a half dozen roses?</i>
