1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:01,854
Ah, friends. You'll recall Jane

2
00:00:01,878 --> 00:00:04,144
had been working on her newest
book for quite some time.

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:05,880
I just had an epiphany
about my new book.

4
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,462
I want to turn it into this big

5
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:09,020
multigenerational story

6
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:10,611
with all of the lightness

7
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,532
and all of the darkness.

8
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:13,592
And great news:

9
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:15,994
she was getting good feedback
from her mentor Marlene.

10
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,059
I would love to show it to
a friend in the industry.

11
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,851
- Really? That would be...
- Okay,

12
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:22,877
okay, the friend is actually my lover.

13
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:25,002
She's in publishing, and she's a genius.

14
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:26,918
And Marlene's
not the only one with a lover.

15
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:28,875
Jane and Rafael were back together.

16
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,564
And he proposed.

17
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,656
- Will you marry me?
- Yes!

18
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:33,959
I know!

19
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:35,749
Heart-eye emojis, right?

20
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:38,374
But in less happy news, their son Mateo

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,299
was having a hard time at school.

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,600
Mateo is really struggling
with his reading.

23
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,425
He is quite far behind
the rest of the class.

24
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,628
Oh, and Jane's dad was struggling, too.

25
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:49,305
See, the fate of his show was
in the hands of the studio.

26
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,663
Barry, I need this pickup.

27
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,643
I know! Straight out of a telenovela

28
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:53,767
inside a telenovela!

29
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:54,797
And speaking of...

30
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,812
remember Rafael's sister Luisa?

31
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:59,304
You know, the one who
was in love with Rose,

32
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,528
aka our supervillain.

33
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:02,486
Thank you for accepting this assignment.

34
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:04,277
Now let's get to work.

35
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:06,884
Well, Luisa swore her off forever,

36
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,243
though recently she seemed

37
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,935
to have had a change of heart again.

38
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,994
I even sent someone to
watch over you. "Girl..."

39
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,752
- Hey, girl, what's up?
- I'm in.

40
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:16,109
What does Rose need me to do?

41
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:17,973
Oh, and I hate to bring this up, but...

42
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:20,686
If you do not help me,
something terrible...

43
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:22,644
I know.

44
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:26,705
I hope Petra's okay. Which
is where we left off.

45
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:29,061
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

46
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:31,786
was 30 years and six months old,

47
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:34,110
her life changed forever.

48
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,702
She gonna be okay?

49
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:41,161
Yes. Unfortunately.

50
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:42,838
My mother's like a cockroach.

51
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:45,431
But that's a month away.

52
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,979
Right now Jane is 30 years
and five months old.

53
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,704
And this is more of a hassle.

54
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,729
Her leg's pretty screwed
up. She'll be fine.

55
00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:55,102
I'm just happy you're all right.

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,417
You know, when I first
woke up after the crash,

57
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:02,143
my first thought was of the girls.

58
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:04,196
What if I died?

59
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:05,821
Then I realized they'd be fine.

60
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:06,978
'Cause they have Rafael.

61
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:09,690
- And you. As a stepmom.
- Oh...

62
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,779
Don't you start crying.
I'm trying to stop...

63
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:12,870
Too late.

64
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:15,963
I just realized I'm gonna be a stepmom.

65
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:19,923
Which brings us here, now.

66
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:21,388
What's going on?

67
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:23,513
I want to make sure everything is equal,

68
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,882
so the girls feel every
bit as important as Mateo.

69
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:27,181
I also think

70
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:28,717
we should buy two more
chairs for the kitchen table,

71
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,186
so they don't have to
sit on folding chairs

72
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,920
every time they come
over, like they're company.

73
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,405
And I'm gonna spend time

74
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,597
with each of them separately

75
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,031
to really get to know them individually.

76
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,553
And learn to tell them apart.

77
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:39,454
That sounds great, but
where is this coming from?

78
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:40,894
We're getting married.

79
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,497
I'm taking on a new role in their life.

80
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,000
And I want to kill this stepmom thing.

81
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,957
Ooh!

82
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,061
Oh! Oh, my God!

83
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,941
I just realized what I
have to do to fix my novel.

84
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,865
I-I've been trying
to crack this chapter,

85
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,910
and I finally figured it out.

86
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:57,174
I have to rearrange everything.

87
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:58,689
I need to go write!

88
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:00,514
- Go! Go write!
- Oh!

89
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,727
And so write she did.

90
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:06,610
Because when the muse struck
Jane, it struck her hard.

91
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:08,513
Pretty much punched her in the face.

92
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:09,738
She had to write.

93
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:11,262
She couldn't stop.

94
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,460
Though life didn't stop around her.

95
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,751
Hey, good news.

96
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:16,497
Petra regained some
mobility in her fingers.

97
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:18,601
She even flipped me off this morning.

98
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:25,660
I just heard the studio loved

99
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:26,751
our This Is Mars pilot.

100
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:27,954
You want to come to
dinner and celebrate?

101
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:30,082
Oh, Dad, I would love to,
but I am on such a roll.

102
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:32,040
Then keep rolling,
my brilliant daughter.

103
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:36,916
Oh, wow. It's sort of smelly in here.

104
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:38,584
- Still in the zone.
- Stay there.

105
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:40,842
I just need to borrow your label maker.

106
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,202
I'm organizing my
nursing school courses.

107
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:44,760
I just registered.

108
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:46,927
This is so good.

109
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:48,252
Okay. I got to go pick up the kids,

110
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:50,443
but I'll read the next
chapter as soon as I get back.

111
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,568
Thank you. Love you.

112
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:04,567
And finally... after
three weeks, five pizzas,

113
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:08,294
and one and a half showers,
Jane finished her novel.

114
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,151
Hallelujah!

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,199
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

116
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,855
Ah... it's awesome.

117
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:29,023
I love... What? What's this?

118
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,507
Uh, my alternate ending.

119
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:33,367
Let me know which one
you think is better.

120
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:34,658
Uh, what's the difference?

121
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:36,534
That comma. It completely changes

122
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,903
the cadence of the last sentence.

123
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:40,325
Okay, I vote no comma.

124
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:44,016
Actually, I might go with the comma.

125
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,307
Okay. It's done.

126
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:48,433
Period. Exclamation point.

127
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,455
Now go send it to Jill.

128
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,825
Ah, yes, Jill.

129
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,476
Marlene's publishing friend.

130
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,533
And lover.

131
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:55,690
Okay. Yeah.

132
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,797
It's good, right?

133
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:00,321
I think it's good.

134
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:01,390
But I also feel strange saying that,

135
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:02,493
like, maybe I'm delusional.

136
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:06,084
You're not. It's better
than good. It's great.

137
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,699
Now go take a shower.

138
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:12,724
It's time.

139
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:21,001
Have you heard anything
about your manuscript?

140
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:22,290
Not yet. I'm spiraling.

141
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:23,783
Please don't ask me about it.

142
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:25,454
Okay, well, yesterday you got
mad because I didn't ask.

143
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,378
Yes, I know. Like I said, I'm spiraling.

144
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,032
Wh-What's going on? Distract me.

145
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,310
Can you take the girls
for a few hours today?

146
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,212
Raf's showing a house. I've
got back-to-back meetings,

147
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:34,897
and the nannies have some
god-awful stomach virus,

148
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:36,634
- so they're banned from the Marbella.
- Of course.

149
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:39,459
Yes! I am officially ready
to step into stepmomming.

150
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:41,517
Great. So can I just go over a few rules

151
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,654
I've developed with their therapist?

152
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:44,056
Mother-to-stepmother communication.

153
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,047
I love it. Give me those rules.

154
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:47,805
Most of it's just common sense.

155
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:49,789
And only one sweet per day.

156
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:51,959
Unless it's Friday. Then they
can have an apple and a sweet.

157
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:53,016
But only after dinner.

158
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,241
And no cheese puffs ever.

159
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,392
I found little orange fingerprints
all over my Prada mules.

160
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,516
- Is that it?
- Yes.

161
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:58,943
Why? Do you need more guidance?

162
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:00,268
No. God, no.

163
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:02,348
Look, all these boundaries and rules

164
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:03,839
make them feel safe and loved.

165
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,063
Because if they don't,

166
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,022
they get manipulative and start to lie.

167
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:08,092
And their therapist said we need

168
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:09,396
to nip that behavior in the bud.

169
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:10,755
Got it. No problem.

170
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,613
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure!

171
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,838
I'm going to finish my shift
and get ready to stepmom it up.

172
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:21,011
What are you doing?

173
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:22,635
I'm stepmomming it up!

174
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,460
You're so weird.

175
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:27,975
Yes, hello.

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,760
This is Dr. Price,
your mother's physician.

177
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:31,690
We need you down here ASAP.

178
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,527
It's fine. You have my
permission to pull the plug.

179
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:35,725
Ma'am, your mother's
not on life support.

180
00:06:36,774 --> 00:06:38,094
What was that?

181
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:40,052
She just threw another bedpan.

182
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,576
We really need you down here.

183
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,235
Just put her on the phone.

184
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:44,969
I won't let them do it!

185
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:47,632
In Czech Republic, they put you under.

186
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,192
Next thing you know, your
kidneys are being auctioned off

187
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:51,417
on black market.

188
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:52,942
Mother, what are you talking about?

189
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:56,235
Doctor say I must cut off leg or die.

190
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,228
Geez, how many
appendages can this lady lose?

191
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:01,298
Really taking her down
to the studs here.

192
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:03,256
Well, I don't know,
Mother, maybe roll the dice.

193
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:05,291
We don't want to gamble on this pilot.

194
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:06,815
That's why we're testing it

195
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,306
before we send it to the network.

196
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:09,897
So how does this work?

197
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,274
Uh, I'm not familiar

198
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:12,731
with the pilot testing process,

199
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:14,556
because my shows always
go straight to series.

200
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:15,581
When they like something,

201
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:16,706
they turn the dial up.

202
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:17,985
When they dislike something,

203
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,110
they turn the dial down.

204
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:25,378
I told you never to interrupt
me while I'm executive producing.

205
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,737
I was just bringing you the coffees

206
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:27,853
- you asked for.
- Never.

207
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,023
All right, but I will take
the coffee, since it's here.

208
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:32,179
Thank you, Girl Rudy.

209
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:33,569
Take me, Steve.

210
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:37,458
What does that mean?

211
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:39,027
Looks like the women in the audience

212
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:41,418
love the romance. And as predicted,

213
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:44,010
the men aren't as interested
in the soapy stuff.

214
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:45,134
The doctor,

215
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,426
he might come back. Then let him watch.

216
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:49,085
Take off your shirt.

217
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,255
Wow. Straight men like boobs.

218
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,323
Pilot-testing seems
like an airtight method.

219
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,674
Our scientists have
finally figured out...

220
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,800
- Oh, I love this scene.
- Oh, me, too.

221
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:59,991
We're perfectly calibrated.

222
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,783
Excuse me, can you check to
see if the dials are broken?

223
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:10,060
Oh, thank God. Never mind.

224
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:13,352
Our passionate lovemaking
has healed my wounds.

225
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,710
Who needs doctors?

226
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:19,383
Great test. We're really happy.

227
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:21,354
- I'd change a few music cues.
- Got it.

228
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:23,659
And then let's get it over to
the network for the weekend.

229
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:24,884
Sounds good.

230
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:30,322
That was a disaster.

231
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,209
What are you talking about?

232
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:33,868
The test scores were through the roof.

233
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:36,894
For those two fetuses, not for us.

234
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,529
If the network sees these scores,

235
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:40,832
they're gonna want to
make the show all about

236
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:42,891
those two mildly talented Mini-Me's

237
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,515
and we're gonna get sidelined.

238
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,806
- What?
- Yes.

239
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,257
Well, that can't happen.

240
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:49,533
This is our show. We're the stars.

241
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:51,578
Exactly. So we're gonna
go back into editing

242
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:53,268
and make sure we stand out more.

243
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:54,581
Otherwise, they're gonna turn us into

244
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:56,438
side characters whose scenes get

245
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:57,862
shorter and shorter, until they're

246
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:59,162
cutting us off mid...

247
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:02,722
Some mandarin oranges for
your Mandarin homework.

248
00:09:02,747 --> 00:09:04,579
We're actually done with our homework.

249
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:07,471
Yeah. Can we have 20
minutes of iPad time?

250
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:10,464
Which one of Petra's
800 rules covered that?

251
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:14,090
Well, uh... just give me a
minute to think about that.

252
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,125
Hey, are you texting our mom?

253
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,555
What? No. Of course not.

254
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,181
I'm just, uh... considering the request.

255
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:30,271
You know... weighing the pros and cons.

256
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:31,472
Really deliberating.

257
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,728
I think it was, um, Henry David Thoreau

258
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:36,187
who said, "To live deliberately,

259
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:39,280
to front only the
essential facts of life..."

260
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:47,755
Anyway, after much
deliberation, the answer is no.

261
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,780
Okay. We'll just go play in our room.

262
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,230
Oh.

263
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:56,495
Marlene?

264
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,686
Jane, hi.

265
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:59,443
Listen, I loved your novel.

266
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,167
Oh, my God. Really?

267
00:10:01,192 --> 00:10:02,858
Yes, it totally delivered.

268
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:05,038
It's as amazing as I knew it would be.

269
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,096
Thank you.

270
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:08,721
Uh, that's great to hear.

271
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:10,445
But unfortunately, Jill

272
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,538
passed on it. She's not
going to represent you.

273
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:18,931
It means that my novel
was rejected, Abuela.

274
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:21,016
The agent doesn't want to represent me.

275
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,173
But you know what?

276
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,219
I'm actually fine, optimistic even.

277
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:25,628
According to Marlene,

278
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:28,923
Jill loved the writing but just
didn't know how to market it,

279
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:32,016
which means that she just
wasn't the right fit for me,

280
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,712
but there are plenty of
other agents out there,

281
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:35,921
and I'm going to get my manuscript

282
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:38,312
to every last one of them.

283
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,337
Abuela?

284
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:46,017
No, I'm printing,

285
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:48,475
and I have to keep printing,
so I'll call you later.

286
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,268
Love you.

287
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,673
Hey. What's going on?

288
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,593
Hey, Aunt Jane.

289
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:03,383
Don't "hey, Aunt Jane" me.

290
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:05,659
You're playing with your iPad
when I specifically told you

291
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:07,699
that you couldn't. Now hand them over.

292
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:09,419
Sorry.

293
00:11:09,444 --> 00:11:11,711
It won't happen again.

294
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:15,334
Okay, then, but you don't
get 'em after dinner. Deal?

295
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,459
Deal.

296
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:18,727
Do you have shrimp cocktail?

297
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:23,232
Maybe with a side of
soy-braised baby back ribs?

298
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:24,533
I have chicken nuggets.

299
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,235
Low-sodium at least?

300
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:28,237
Absolutely.

301
00:11:28,262 --> 00:11:29,895
Look at that.

302
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,020
Super Stepmom in the house.

303
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:33,653
Everything go okay with the girls?

304
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:35,777
Yeah. For the most part,
it was smooth sailing.

305
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:37,489
Wh-What do you mean "for the most part"?

306
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:40,132
Well, we did have a minor
issue, but I handled it.

307
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,291
What happened? I need
to know all the details.

308
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,059
It's important.

309
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:47,838
Okay, but please don't
tell them that I told you

310
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:49,883
because we're really starting to bond.

311
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:51,642
Also bonding...

312
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,469
Okay, girl, let's go over
the details one more time.

313
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:58,149
Oh, don't worry, I've got it.
I'm just gonna go to Rafael,

314
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:00,151
and I'm gonna beg him for the tie tack.

315
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:01,242
Simple pimple.

316
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,033
Exactly.

317
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:05,492
I wish I could do it.
If I could, I would.

318
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,484
And in fact, he tried.

319
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,357
No problem.

320
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:16,593
But why does Rose want
the tie tack? Do you know?

321
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:18,085
One step at a time.

322
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,343
But she does have a plan, right?

323
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:22,668
Rose always has a plan,

324
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:25,093
and the tie tack is phase two.

325
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:29,309
Pause!

326
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:31,877
Okay, that was a very sexy scream,

327
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:33,802
but there was a slight downward turn

328
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:36,293
in the corners of River's
mouth at the end of the shot.

329
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:37,984
Totally true.

330
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,658
Can we trim off about
two and a half frames?

331
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:42,549
Well, yeah, sure, but, look,

332
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:44,981
if you guys want me to
tweak every single frame,

333
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,453
we'll be here all night.

334
00:12:46,478 --> 00:12:47,478
Good point, Mia.

335
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:50,034
Let's check in with our loved ones

336
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:51,671
and tell them it's
gonna be an all-nighter.

337
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:53,228
Geez...

338
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:55,687
What is it, Rogelio? We're
seeing you in less than an hour.

339
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:00,198
Darci, listen, what is the one thing

340
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:01,956
in the world you love more than Baby?

341
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,246
When you owe me a favor.

342
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:04,370
Exactly.

343
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:06,429
And, boy, am I gonna owe you a big one.

344
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,153
I'm on a time crunch at work.

345
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:10,106
Can we pretty please swap Baby days?

346
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:11,163
Again?

347
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,422
Esteban is going on a
yoga retreat tomorrow,

348
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:15,048
and tonight was couples time.

349
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:16,205
Darci, please,

350
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,430
my pilot hangs in the balance.

351
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:20,288
Fine,

352
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:21,747
but I'm not gonna
forget about this favor.

353
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:24,040
Oh, you're a lifesaver. Thank Esteban,

354
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:25,130
and tell Baby I love her.

355
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:28,156
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rogelio is such a...

356
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:30,014
Ah, ah, ah.

357
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,356
Crap.

358
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,314
What's wrong?

359
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:41,172
Uh...

360
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:42,980
just got another rejection letter.

361
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:44,805
Geez, it's 7:00 a.m.

362
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,897
Let the girl have a cup of coffee first.

363
00:13:46,922 --> 00:13:49,089
I'm sorry.

364
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,917
I can get off work early
and pick up the girls

365
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:53,075
so you don't have to.

366
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,300
No, no, no, life goes on,

367
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:58,093
and I still have plenty
of agents to hear from,

368
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:01,920
and me and the girls
are making real progress.

369
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:03,306
You tattled on us!

370
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:04,906
That's so lame.

371
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:07,265
New name: Lame Jane.

372
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,891
- No, stop.
- Stop what, Lame Jane?

373
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,682
I only told your mother what happened

374
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,740
because we're all on one team.

375
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,985
Team twins, huh? Go team!

376
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,143
Yikes.

377
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:19,600
Pretty lame, Jane.

378
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,224
Snitches get stitches.

379
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:23,016
And end up in ditches.

380
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,941
We don't hang out with narcs.

381
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:28,163
What... Hey, no, girls,
come back here right now.

382
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:31,056
Um, excuse me. Stop it!

383
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,880
My luggage!

384
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,504
Wh... Are you their nanny?

385
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,195
You need to get control of them.

386
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:40,052
Just because I'm Latina doesn't
mean that I'm their nanny.

387
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,377
- Yeah, she's not our nanny.
- Huh.

388
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:45,844
She's our evil stepmother,
and we hate her.

389
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,374
- Hurry up and get ready for dinner, girls.
- So how was it?

390
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:56,908
- Well, not great.
- What happened?

391
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:59,710
What happened is that you
told them what I told you,

392
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,335
and now they think I'm a big tattletale.

393
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,761
In their defense,
you're tattling right now.

394
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,986
Who cares? This isn't middle
school, it's parenting.

395
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:07,455
You said you weren't gonna say anything.

396
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,939
Well, I changed my mind,
because I'm their mother,

397
00:15:09,964 --> 00:15:11,998
and it's my job to decide
what's best for them.

398
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,500
And, frankly, you
shouldn't have asked me

399
00:15:13,524 --> 00:15:15,992
not to say something in
the first place. Got it?

400
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,983
Fine. Okay. Got it.

401
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:19,208
Thank you.

402
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,233
So any incidents to report today?

403
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,633
Yes, we did have an issue.

404
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:29,787
They ran away because
they were upset with me.

405
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:31,814
Thank you.

406
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,982
Girls, get out here!
Jane told me what you did!

407
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:36,547
And speaking of fractured relationships.

408
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,992
Whatever you have to say, I
don't want to hear it. Just go.

409
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:42,550
Wait, wait, wait! I understand
how you feel and why.

410
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,843
And after this, I will
leave you alone forever.

411
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:48,441
But I have no family left,

412
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:51,433
and I just wanted

413
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,892
something small of Dad's before I go.

414
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,305
What is it?

415
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,222
It's this

416
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:01,065
gold and onyx tie tack.

417
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:02,610
It's not worth much,

418
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:04,935
but it's got sentimental value to me.

419
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,527
Dad wore it to my med school graduation,

420
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,350
and I could...

421
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:12,654
I could really use a
reminder of a time in my life

422
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,213
when I was worthy of my
family's love and respect.

423
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,305
Oh, wow, she's good.

424
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,764
I got it.

425
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:23,589
Well, I, um, I have the tie tack,

426
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:24,981
so you know what I'll do?

427
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:27,306
- What?
- Take it straight to the police,

428
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,026
because if you want it, then it

429
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:30,783
probably has something to do with Rose.

430
00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:32,609
Oh, wow, guess he's better.

431
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,600
Raf, please, don't.

432
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,240
Push in on that look.

433
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,067
Now pull out on both of us.

434
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:17,583
Oh, my God, we look amazing.

435
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:18,707
We're popping so much.

436
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:22,067
We're like a thousand champagne
corks exploding at once.

437
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:23,617
And we're done.

438
00:17:23,695 --> 00:17:25,862
Okay, now let's send this new tape

439
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:28,538
to the studio to get to
the network. Girl Rudy,

440
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:31,145
we need you to get the
new cut to the studio ASAP.

441
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,403
Oh, I already did.

442
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,140
What are you talking about?

443
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,925
The network said it
had to be in by 3:00,

444
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,144
so the studio told me to
deliver the latest cut.

445
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:39,669
Why didn't you tell me that?

446
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:41,941
You said never to interrupt you
when you're executive producing.

447
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:43,143
Call the network right now

448
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,735
and tell them that a
new cut is on the way.

449
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,497
I can't. They're at a corporate
retreat and unreachable.

450
00:17:47,522 --> 00:17:50,088
That's why it needed to be in by 3:00.

451
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,371
That makes three.

452
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:54,968
Three rejections just today.

453
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:56,695
Hey, it only takes one, right?

454
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,654
That's what I keep telling myself,

455
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,946
but I think I need one of Dad's famous

456
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:02,337
"fight for your art" pep talks.

457
00:18:02,477 --> 00:18:04,276
- Ah!
- Oh, good, you're home.

458
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:05,868
Rogelio, tell Jane what it's like

459
00:18:05,893 --> 00:18:07,773
finally getting to work
on your passion project.

460
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:08,972
Oh.

461
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:11,794
Sure. Well, it's, uh, horrible.

462
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:14,144
My career is over. I might as well quit.

463
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:15,196
Why?

464
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,337
Because your daughter needs a pep talk.

465
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,807
She got a few more rejection letters.

466
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,597
Oh, I'm sorry.

467
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:22,221
You have to believe in yourself, Jane.

468
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:24,213
That is the most important thing.

469
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:26,464
The crazy thing is, is I actually do.

470
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:29,217
I think that there is an agent
out there who will love my book,

471
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,281
but my manuscript's not
even getting to their desks.

472
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,244
- How do you know?
- I worked in publishing.

473
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:36,539
I'm getting form letter
rejections from assistants.

474
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:39,649
The last one was addressed
to "Jake Villanuts."

475
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,200
H-Have you heard back from everyone?

476
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,067
Well, not Isabel Allende's agent,

477
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,960
but there's no way that my
book is getting even near her.

478
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:52,252
Unless you get it near her.

479
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:56,076
Did I ever tell you how I got this scar?

480
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,269
I'll make some tea. Remember
your health, Rogelio. Keep calm.

481
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:01,327
Of course. I'm perfectly calm.

482
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:02,885
So, calmly.

483
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,051
When I was a young actor in Mexico City,

484
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:08,598
Alejandro González Iñárritu
was directing a movie about a hobo

485
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:09,989
who through sheer handsomeness

486
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:13,282
becomes the richest
oil tycoon in the world.

487
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:15,407
So I dressed as a homeless man

488
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:19,034
and waited along the route
Iñárritu took every day to work.

489
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,893
Then I saw his car,
so I ran into traffic

490
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:23,717
with a bucket and a squeegee.

491
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:25,396
That's how you got your scar?

492
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:27,388
You got hit by a car
while method auditioning?

493
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,180
No.

494
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:32,973
Iñárritu didn't recognize me
and threatened to call the police.

495
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:34,521
But I didn't give up.

496
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:36,715
The next day, I went to Iñárritu's house

497
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,961
and hand-delivered my headshot
to Iñárritu's girlfriend.

498
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:43,399
She was very nice and invited me inside.

499
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:45,457
Then one thing led to another,

500
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:47,815
and let's just say that
when Iñárritu got home,

501
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,473
I had to jump out the window.

502
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:50,777
And that's how you got your scar?

503
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:53,931
No. I'm incredibly agile
and landed on my feet,

504
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:57,392
right in the middle of
Iñárritu's guard dogs.

505
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,151
- So you were bitten?
- No.

506
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:01,906
I used my incredible
cunning and a little hypnosis

507
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,564
and got away, and then Iñárritu

508
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:05,410
found my headshot under his pillow.

509
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:07,402
- And then you got the part?
- No.

510
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,339
Actually, Iñárritu banned
me from his sets for life.

511
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:13,226
But the rumor of our feud

512
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:16,228
got a ton of coverage
in the Mexican tabloids,

513
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:17,453
and all of that attention

514
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:19,991
got me an audition for
The Passions of Santos,

515
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:22,883
which then launched my career.

516
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:25,686
So you see, Jane, when you have a dream,

517
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:27,577
you never give up.

518
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:29,711
So how did you get the scar?

519
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:31,769
Oh, oh...

520
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:34,227
I cut myself while framing an issue

521
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:35,986
of People en Español about the scandal.

522
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,637
Well, it was the first
time I saw my name in print.

523
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:42,079
I still remember the headline.

524
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:45,932
"Crazed D-Lister Stalks Iñárritu."

525
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:49,776
The point is, I didn't
throw in the towel

526
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:51,243
when things got hard.

527
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:53,044
Hmm. Dad, you just came in here

528
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,401
and said you were giving up,

529
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:55,692
that your career was over.

530
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:57,617
Well, I was wrong. I'm not giving up.

531
00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:59,619
And neither will you, Jake Villanuts.

532
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:01,086
Now tell me.

533
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,377
How badly do you want

534
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:04,197
your manuscript read by this agent?

535
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,523
I want it with everything that I am.

536
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:08,448
Well, that's all I needed to hear.

537
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:11,132
- I have a plan.
- I am not going to break into

538
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:13,397
the agent's house and put my
manuscript under her pillow.

539
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:17,502
Okay then. I have a plan B.

540
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,535
Planning a covert operation requires

541
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,469
stealth and discipline and...

542
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:26,627
Moo Shu pork, yum. That was fantastic.

543
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:28,505
Okay. Let's synchronize our watches.

544
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,808
And go over the plan one more time.

545
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:31,777
The agent leaves

546
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:34,689
at 5:00 p.m. on Fridays
with her weekend reading.

547
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:37,015
At 4:40, you're gonna enter the building

548
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,378
- disguised as a delivery person.
- And I tell security,

549
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:40,742
"I have a package for the fifth floor."

550
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,597
At 4:48, you're gonna
enter the agent's office

551
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:44,112
and you're gonna use your decoy box

552
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,736
to knock over the stack of manuscripts.

553
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,461
And as I help pick up the fallen papers,

554
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:49,292
I slide my manuscript
on the top of her pile

555
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:51,029
- for her weekend reading.
- By the end of the day,

556
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,907
the agent takes your novel home. Boom.

557
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:54,164
Dad, you are amazing.

558
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,534
But the mission isn't accomplished yet.

559
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:56,869
To make it happen by the weekend,

560
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,471
- we have to move quickly.
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,396
Rudy! Get me props, stat.

562
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,522
I also need wardrobe and makeup.

563
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:06,087
My daughter needs a great disguise.

564
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:07,378
Wow.

565
00:22:07,403 --> 00:22:09,570
That's a really great disguise.

566
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,649
Did Rogelio call Rose's mask maker?

567
00:22:11,804 --> 00:22:13,070
Oh.

568
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:14,306
There she is.

569
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,529
Hey.

570
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:18,231
Hey. Uh, I booked a last-minute showing

571
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:20,557
that I need to be at,
like, five minutes ago.

572
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:23,527
And I know I said I would
pick up the girls, but I can't.

573
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,620
And the nanny's still sick
and Petra's in a meeting

574
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,375
and I should really be
in there with her and I...

575
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:28,565
It's just, uh,

576
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,390
I'm kind of in the middle
of a business thing.

577
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:33,188
- Wait, what business thing?
- A none-of-your-business thing.

578
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:35,038
Nothing, never mind,
I'll pick up the girls.

579
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:38,123
- No, Jane. What about the plan?
- Don't worry.

580
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,644
I've got one. Our cut needs
to get to the network.

581
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:42,847
We've worked too hard to get
this project off the ground.

582
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:44,177
My younger self would not

583
00:22:44,202 --> 00:22:45,549
have given up and neither will I.

584
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,640
Agreed. But what does that have to do

585
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:49,485
with... those hideous things?

586
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,544
I found out that every year

587
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,567
the network execs watch all their pilots

588
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,459
at a remote wilderness lodge.

589
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:57,295
No phones, no computers.

590
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,206
- No audience testing.
- But how will they know

591
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:00,782
that straight men like boobs?

592
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:03,032
It's just the top brass
in a screening room.

593
00:23:03,057 --> 00:23:04,400
Totally off the grid.

594
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,478
But...

595
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:07,002
here's the grid.

596
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:08,827
The lodge is here...

597
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:10,783
surrounded by some swamp.

598
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,814
So we'll need waders and camouflage

599
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,939
fishing vests.

600
00:23:13,964 --> 00:23:17,431
The waders will help us to
safely traverse the terrain.

601
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:21,117
And the fishing vests will
have pockets for all our needs.

602
00:23:21,142 --> 00:23:23,691
I wanted to get us
self-destructing burner phones,

603
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:26,308
but Rudy said those aren't
real, so I just got us

604
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,648
regular boring burner phones.

605
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:31,377
We will wade in through the swamp,

606
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:32,834
slip into the screening room

607
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,947
while they're at lunch,
swap out the tape

608
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:37,673
and no one will ever know. Are you in?

609
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:39,464
There is no way in hell she's gonna...

610
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:41,055
I am so in.

611
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,632
Wow. Okay.

612
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:45,291
We cannot let them keep on shifting

613
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:47,716
the focus younger and
younger and younger.

614
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:49,719
- What are we doing here?
- I just have

615
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:51,798
to make a quick delivery and
then we'll be out of here.

616
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,297
What kind of delivery?

617
00:23:53,322 --> 00:23:55,268
Are you a secret drug runner?

618
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:58,448
No. No, I just... just my book.

619
00:23:58,473 --> 00:24:00,573
And I've been working
on it for the past year.

620
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:02,723
Actually, years. I've
worked on it for years

621
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:04,443
and I need to get it
to somebody to read it.

622
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:06,233
Then what's with the off-brand polo?

623
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:07,702
You look like a caddy.

624
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:09,893
It's complicated. And I know

625
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:11,783
you're still mad at me for tattling,

626
00:24:11,808 --> 00:24:13,952
but right now I need you both
to be on your best behavior.

627
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:16,110
What's in it for us?

628
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:17,801
Here's the thing:

629
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:19,359
nothing is in it for you.

630
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:21,227
Because you don't do
something for someone

631
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,327
just to get something.

632
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:23,884
I'm asking you

633
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:26,253
for your help as your future stepmom

634
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:27,843
who loves you.

635
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:30,813
We need to hurry. Please.

636
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:31,903
Just act natural.

637
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,961
Delivery lady.

638
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:36,086
Just, uh, making some deliveries.

639
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,310
Per the yuj. What up?

640
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:40,402
Yeah, very natural, Jane.

641
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,304
Okay, you stay here

642
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:44,569
and, uh, hide behind that plant

643
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:46,294
while I take a delivery box.

644
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,852
Shoot, the box.

645
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:49,076
Left it in the car.

646
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:50,566
Uh, it's fine.

647
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:52,995
- I-I can go get it.
- Why do you need a box?

648
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,793
Because she's pretending
to be a delivery person

649
00:24:55,818 --> 00:24:57,218
to get past security.

650
00:24:57,243 --> 00:24:58,743
- Obvi.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

651
00:24:58,768 --> 00:25:00,698
- Can I help you?
- Uh-oh.

652
00:25:00,723 --> 00:25:02,990
Looks like this plan
is set to self-destruct

653
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:06,081
in three, two, one.

654
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:09,495
- What is your business here?
- Lose the badge.

655
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:12,381
Excuse me? Don't you know

656
00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:14,305
who our mother is?

657
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,837
Anna and Ellie Beedham.

658
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:19,077
Her assistant said
she was calling ahead.

659
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,968
She is so fired.

660
00:25:20,993 --> 00:25:22,667
- So fired.
- Wait, stop.

661
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:23,824
Let's not fire anyone.

662
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:25,015
It could have been me.

663
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,351
Now, what floor did
you say you're going to?

664
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,642
The 26th. Beedham.

665
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:30,111
And you are?

666
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:36,494
I'm their nanny.

667
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,718
Got it.

668
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:42,579
Thank you so much,
girls, that was amazing.

669
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:44,302
A-And real quick...

670
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:46,167
it's okay that I told him
that I was your nanny

671
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:47,494
because I was using
his bias against him.

672
00:25:47,518 --> 00:25:50,307
So it was subversive. Huh?
Do you know what that means?

673
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:51,897
Of course we do. We're not idiots.

674
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:56,248
What the hell are you wearing?

675
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:59,069
Oh, I'm trying on clothes.

676
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:00,317
F-For a work thing.

677
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:02,142
What are you doing here?

678
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,076
I'm on my way to New York.

679
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,656
Two of my clients are
on the brink of divorce

680
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:08,859
so I have to do an
emergency counseling session

681
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:10,170
and Esteban is away.

682
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,564
So I need you to take Baby

683
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:13,196
- for the next two days.
- Oh.

684
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:16,199
Oh, but I-I-I, I-I have a, a-a very

685
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:17,990
- big...
- And totally insane...

686
00:26:18,189 --> 00:26:20,756
... work thing, yeah. The
fate of my show hangs...

687
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:22,248
Rogelio.

688
00:26:22,273 --> 00:26:23,739
I just covered your ass

689
00:26:23,764 --> 00:26:25,330
and now I need you to cover mine.

690
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:26,965
You said it yourself. You owe me.

691
00:26:27,164 --> 00:26:28,997
Prioritize your daughter.

692
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:30,256
I do prioritize her.

693
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:31,880
No, you haven't been lately.

694
00:26:31,905 --> 00:26:34,606
You've been prioritizing work.

695
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:36,796
These are the moments, Rogelio.

696
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:38,354
You won't get them back.

697
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:40,244
Baby won't be a baby forever.

698
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,235
Of course I'll take her.

699
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,559
Thank you.

700
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:45,771
And, uh, a little advice.

701
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:46,995
Whatever Duck Dynasty

702
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,987
is offering, it's not
worth it; you look absurd.

703
00:26:49,056 --> 00:26:51,222
Wha...

704
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,891
I know.

705
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:57,395
The idea that I could look
absurd is absurd. Mwah.

706
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:00,331
Yeah.

707
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,999
River?

708
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:03,467
There has been a change of plans.

709
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,071
Wait, what happened with their plan?

710
00:27:14,714 --> 00:27:16,847
I can't believe that worked!

711
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,916
- Oh, yay.
- Did you see that?

712
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:20,829
I just put the manuscript
right on top of the pile.

713
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:22,886
We'll lie for you any time, Aunt Jane.

714
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,257
Okay...

715
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:28,225
Wait, I... Uh...

716
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:31,783
I-I did that because
it was a last resort.

717
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:34,075
But that was wrong
and I really shouldn't

718
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,643
have lied and pretended
to be somebody else

719
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:37,901
and I definitely shouldn't
have dragged you into this.

720
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:39,292
So...

721
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:43,020
as punishment, I get no iPad for a week.

722
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:45,242
I'm serious.

723
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,044
And I want you both to enforce it.

724
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,000
If you catch me even looking at one,

725
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:50,124
I want you to take it away.

726
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,918
I really hope that
agent reads your book.

727
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:57,387
Yeah. Me, too.

728
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:00,557
Mm.

729
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:04,093
I think...

730
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,095
this is it.

731
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:07,995
My last shot.

732
00:28:09,668 --> 00:28:11,033
What?

733
00:28:11,985 --> 00:28:13,603
If the agent likes my book...

734
00:28:13,716 --> 00:28:16,350
- She will.
- I hope so.

735
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,375
That would be...

736
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,200
everything.

737
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:22,124
But if not...

738
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:24,282
then I need to move on.

739
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,202
To the next chapter of my life.

740
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:27,827
You mean, give up writing?

741
00:28:27,852 --> 00:28:30,153
Not give up. Just...

742
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,966
look at it more like a hobby,

743
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,491
less of a career.

744
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,696
- That feels like giving up.
- No.

745
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:40,963
No, it feels like I'm being realistic.

746
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,420
I mean, my dad guaranteed my last book.

747
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:44,944
And with this one...

748
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:46,903
I mean...

749
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:48,637
I'm proud of what I wrote.

750
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:50,796
It's what I wanted to write.

751
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:52,786
But if I can't sell it,

752
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:54,611
then I need to find
another way to make money.

753
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:56,836
And contribute. And leave the Marbella,

754
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:58,357
which I always say I will,

755
00:28:58,382 --> 00:28:59,870
but I keep ending up back there

756
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:01,694
and I want to get out so badly.

757
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:03,019
Yeah, I get that.

758
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:06,114
I just hope she loves your book.

759
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:09,174
Yeah. Me, too.

760
00:29:20,556 --> 00:29:22,515
Which brings us, friends, to the morning

761
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,541
when Jane turned 30
years and six months old.

762
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,850
The day her life changed forever.

763
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:40,792
Good morning.

764
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:44,059
Isabel Allende's agent read my book...

765
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,752
And she passed.

766
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:48,629
Oh, I'm so sorry.

767
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,286
You okay?

768
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:52,444
It's just, uh...

769
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:55,035
I kept reminding myself how hard it was

770
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,427
to get out of the pile.

771
00:29:56,452 --> 00:29:58,085
But I did.

772
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,191
And my work was read.

773
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:03,632
But it wasn't good enough.

774
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:08,292
So... I have to move on.

775
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:09,650
No, you don't.

776
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,128
- I have to be realistic.
- Why?

777
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:12,553
Because it's time.

778
00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:15,656
I gave myself one more book.

779
00:30:16,078 --> 00:30:18,345
- It's time.
- I really love

780
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,027
your book, Mommy.

781
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:22,430
Thanks, Mr. Sweetface.

782
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:25,577
Our...

783
00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:29,236
story... be... gins...

784
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:32,940
Mateo, that is the opening line
of my book! You just read that!

785
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:34,902
- I read it!
- You read!

786
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:39,113
See? Something good
already came from it.

787
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:41,503
Ew!

788
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:42,938
No more kissing. More reading.

789
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:44,295
You got it.

790
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,220
"'I want to run faster, '

791
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:47,687
he said to the cow.

792
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:51,558
'But I'm a slow turtle,
and I don't know how.'"

793
00:31:05,685 --> 00:31:07,017
Yeah...

794
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:10,640
And, friends, that's when...

795
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:12,022
Oh, my God.

796
00:31:12,047 --> 00:31:14,401
My baby Baby's walking.

797
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:15,793
You did it.

798
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:18,308
Oh, my God, I cannot believe this.

799
00:31:19,888 --> 00:31:22,209
You know what? Let's not take this.

800
00:31:22,234 --> 00:31:26,670
Let's just enjoy our time
together and take selfies.

801
00:31:26,695 --> 00:31:28,761
Okay?

802
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:34,110
The girls told me what you had them do.

803
00:31:34,135 --> 00:31:36,936
I can't believe they tattled on me.

804
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,651
It's not funny, Jane.

805
00:31:38,676 --> 00:31:40,116
How could you not tell me about this?

806
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,739
Because I handled it.

807
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:43,197
The girls are never gonna trust me

808
00:31:43,222 --> 00:31:44,687
if I tell you every single thing.

809
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:46,479
Oh, well, too bad. I'm their mother.

810
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,624
Yes, you're their mother,
but I'm not their nanny.

811
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,604
You can't just hand out orders to me.

812
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:54,174
I didn't plan to involve the
girls, it just kind of happened,

813
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,010
and I'm sorry, I really am.

814
00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:58,068
But I made sure the girls
knew that it was wrong.

815
00:31:58,093 --> 00:31:59,570
- Uh...
- And I'm gonna work really hard to make sure

816
00:31:59,594 --> 00:32:00,904
that they follow through
with their therapy,

817
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:03,255
but I need to have my own
relationship with them.

818
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,873
For the record, they would have

819
00:32:04,897 --> 00:32:07,221
their own relationship, one of
the most trying relationships

820
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:09,662
of Jane's life.

821
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:11,357
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

822
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:14,142
So no, I-I'm not going
to tell you everything,

823
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:16,626
but like you said, the
most important thing is that

824
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:20,012
they feel safe and loved,
which they do now, with me.

825
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,227
- Hello?
- This is Dr. Price.

826
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,967
We amputated your mother's leg,

827
00:32:25,992 --> 00:32:28,286
but she's taken a turn for the worse.

828
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:31,446
Sorry to have to tell you this,
but she's now on life support.

829
00:32:32,562 --> 00:32:34,236
I told you before,
you can pull the plug.

830
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:35,994
Actually, you need to
put that in writing.

831
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:37,206
I did put it in writing.

832
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:38,817
A text with a plug emoji

833
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:40,709
and a thumbs-up doesn't count.

834
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:42,401
You need to do it in person.

835
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:44,702
Fine.

836
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:47,144
I need to go to the hospital
to unplug my mother.

837
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:48,502
Let's continue this in the car.

838
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:59,768
Finally.

839
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,499
Got it.

840
00:33:15,568 --> 00:33:17,701
My father's watch?

841
00:33:17,726 --> 00:33:21,138
The watch has nothing to do with it.

842
00:33:21,163 --> 00:33:23,663
It's what's inside.

843
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,437
A fingerprint?

844
00:33:28,462 --> 00:33:29,660
Your father's.

845
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:32,882
Which means we can open it.

846
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:34,784
Open... ?

847
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:40,590
Holy...

848
00:33:40,658 --> 00:33:43,293
Oh, yeah.

849
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:46,396
It's go time, girl.

850
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:54,332
They always look so
peaceful, don't they?

851
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:55,757
Before they cross over?

852
00:33:55,782 --> 00:33:58,417
Mm? Oh, yeah. She looks great.

853
00:33:58,442 --> 00:34:00,976
So should we get this show on the road?

854
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:02,434
Excuse me?

855
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,226
Unplug her?

856
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,811
This is very... uh... painful,

857
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:11,971
uh, so, sooner the better.

858
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:13,262
I understand.

859
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:14,819
I'll get the paperwork,

860
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,776
give you a chance to say
goodbye to your mother.

861
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:17,866
Perfect.

862
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,257
You can hold her hand.

863
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:27,080
Awesome. Thank you.

864
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,642
You okay?

865
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,527
Is it done?

866
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,321
No, not yet. I just needed
to get out of there.

867
00:34:51,346 --> 00:34:53,879
It's okay to feel sad.

868
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:55,837
I do.

869
00:34:55,862 --> 00:35:00,332
Because... I feel nothing for her.

870
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,333
I was standing

871
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:05,592
over her body trying to remind myself

872
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:10,320
of some of the good things
she's done, but I couldn't.

873
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,713
She was a horrible,

874
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:16,206
selfish, evil person, and
growing up with her was awful.

875
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:17,797
I know.

876
00:35:17,822 --> 00:35:20,121
And you don't have to
cry for your mother.

877
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:23,180
You can cry for yourself
because you deserved better.

878
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,922
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

879
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:31,035
She's the reason I'm so
strict with the girls.

880
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,160
If even some of her genes
passed down to them...

881
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:35,519
Stop. The twins are great.

882
00:35:35,544 --> 00:35:37,810
- They lie.
- Oh, all kids lie.

883
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,268
They're just smarter than most.

884
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:41,659
But they're gonna be all
right because they have you.

885
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:44,718
And Rafael, and me. And we're a team.

886
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,309
Don't say it.

887
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:47,466
Team Twins.

888
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:49,003
Lame Jane strikes again.

889
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:51,128
- They told you, huh?
- Yes.

890
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:54,737
- Hey. You okay?
- Yes, I am.

891
00:35:54,762 --> 00:35:56,763
- You didn't have to come.
- Oh, stop.

892
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,188
We are family.

893
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:05,361
Hello?

894
00:36:05,386 --> 00:36:09,321
And, friends, I did say her
life would change forever.

895
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:14,128
Oh, my God.

896
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:16,086
Thank you.

897
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:17,709
Who was that?

898
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:19,834
- An agent. A really big one.
- And?

899
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:20,899
She wants to represent me.

900
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:22,102
- Jane!
- What?!

901
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:23,526
- Jane!
- Yes!

902
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,250
Yes!

903
00:36:25,982 --> 00:36:28,972
Oh, my God, Jane, that's amazing.

904
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:30,985
Um...

905
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:33,655
- Oh...
- I'm really sorry.

906
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,515
I couldn't get the tape.
I tried to, trust me.

907
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,606
- What happened, did the map not work?
- No.

908
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:41,886
I wasn't gonna go into that swamp alone.

909
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,311
I sent PJ.

910
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:45,470
- Who's PJ?
- Girl Rudy.

911
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,713
But she couldn't pull it off.

912
00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:50,583
And between you and me, I don't
even know how hard she tried.

913
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:52,053
Well, you know what? I-I actually think

914
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:54,244
- it's for the best.
- What are you talking about?

915
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:56,203
Well, the first cut was
actually really good.

916
00:36:56,228 --> 00:36:59,863
And maybe right now, for
where I am in my life,

917
00:37:00,437 --> 00:37:02,204
not being the star is a good thing.

918
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:03,862
What, are you having a stroke?

919
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,653
You're not making any sense.

920
00:37:05,678 --> 00:37:07,110
I know, it's crazy.

921
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:09,468
All right, but I... But today,

922
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:12,926
I-I got to see my daughter
walk for the first time.

923
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:15,296
And I would have missed
that, just like I missed

924
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:19,256
Jane's first steps, and I don't want to.

925
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:20,865
And I had a health scare,

926
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,818
and, well, all of that made
me realize that I am ready

927
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,609
for the next phase in my life.

928
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:29,196
I am okay being sidelined just a little,

929
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:31,686
becoming one of the standout
supporting characters

930
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:33,177
that people look forward to,

931
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:34,927
the one who goes on to win

932
00:37:35,184 --> 00:37:37,419
Teen Choice Awards...

933
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:39,744
the spice, not the dish...

934
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:42,503
so I can enjoy other parts of my life.

935
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,896
Well, that's great. That's just perfect.

936
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:50,022
Oh, come on. Aren't you ready
to slow down, just a little?

937
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:51,414
And focus on what?

938
00:37:51,587 --> 00:37:54,087
It's different for you.

939
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:55,937
You've got these great relationships

940
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:57,360
with your daughters.

941
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:58,476
Whereas mine

942
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:00,701
barely even speaks to me.

943
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:02,633
You have a daughter?

944
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:05,759
Yes. In fact, you've met her.

945
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,050
Excuse me?

946
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:09,179
She's our P.A.

947
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:14,976
Girl Rudy?

948
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,868
Yeah. PJ.

949
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,025
The P is for Pond.

950
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,408
Pond Juniper Fields.

951
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,764
Why didn't you tell me?

952
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:24,289
She doesn't want people to know.

953
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:26,844
That's why I'm mean to her.

954
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,036
She wants to be treated
like everyone else.

955
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:31,158
Wow, I can't believe it.

956
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,484
Well, it's true. She hates me.

957
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:35,343
That's why I bury myself

958
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:38,135
in my work, so I don't
have to face the fact

959
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,994
that I failed as a mother.

960
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,986
Well, you know what?

961
00:38:44,011 --> 00:38:45,644
I can help you win her back.

962
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:47,769
- No, it's too late.
- Don't say that.

963
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:50,895
I reconnected with Jane
when she was 23 and a half.

964
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,108
And the connection between
a mother and a daughter

965
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:54,907
is so sacred.

966
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:58,334
Well... sometimes.

967
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:10,580
Mother, I wish your
life had been easier.

968
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:12,830
And therefore, my life had been easier.

969
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,795
Soon, you'll be in a better place.

970
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,253
Or not.

971
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:20,779
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

972
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:23,513
Did Magda just squeeze her hand?

973
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:26,138
Talk about a death grip.

974
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,895
I'll just sign with the other hand.

975
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,153
Not quite ready to let go.

976
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,475
C-Can I have a proxy sign for me?

977
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,867
Jane, Raf? Either one of you?

978
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:38,521
There's activity.

979
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:40,013
It's a miracle.

980
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:43,644
It's alive!

981
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,913
We should order flowers.

982
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:49,454
- For Magda?
- No. For Petra.

983
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:52,586
I have a suggestion for flowers.

984
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:55,378
Now that everything is in
place, we can move forward.

985
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:57,771
Is everyone ready?

986
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:06,734
How about... a half dozen roses?

987
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:13,694
