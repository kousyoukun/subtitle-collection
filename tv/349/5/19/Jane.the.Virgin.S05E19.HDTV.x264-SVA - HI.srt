00:00:00,396 --> 00:00:03,123
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, friends. Where to start?</i>

2
00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:05,316
<i>With the accidental
insemination?</i>

3
00:00:05,404 --> 00:00:07,066
<i>With the love story?</i>

4
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:08,564
<i>With the heartbreak?</i>

5
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:09,939
PETRA:
<i>J.R. broke up with me.</i>

6
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:11,569
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>With the friendship...</i>

7
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:13,609
I'll just ask one
of my sisters for an egg.

8
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:15,279
I don't want to complicate
our friendship.

9
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:17,396
<i>With the marriages...</i>

10
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,185
<i>With the family...</i>

11
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,360
<i>With the career high...</i>

12
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,416
The auction's over.

13
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:25,285
$500,000.

14
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:26,539
You did it, Jane.

15
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,369
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>With the three women...</i>

16
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:31,420
<i>At the end of the day,
those three women.</i>

17
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:34,277
<i>Yes, friends,
let's start there.</i>

18
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:37,287
<i>Since that's where
our story began...</i>

19
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:42,514
<i>When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was a much younger girl,</i>

20
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:44,654
<i>she had to face
the unthinkable...</i>

21
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:47,350
What do you mean
the telenovela's gonna end?

22
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:49,899
Well, they just revealed
the last big secret.

23
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:51,529
So the show's
almost over.

24
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:53,060
Forever?

25
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,254
But Lina watches
<i>Days of our Lives</i>

26
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:58,490
with her family,
and they're on season 34.

27
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:15,694
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>Yes, friends,</i>

28
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:18,420
<i>our Jane never loved endings.</i>

29
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:22,701
<i>And yet, here she was,
facing a doozy.</i>

30
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:24,990
I just don't think
I can say goodbye.

31
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:26,211
To the couch?

32
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:28,496
It was our first
big purchase together.

33
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:30,238
How can we just
get rid of it?

34
00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:32,099
Just think how happy it'll make
someone who didn't

35
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:34,709
just sign a massive book deal.

36
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:37,409
Come on. You said you wanted
to splurge on something.

37
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,489
And I will, just not
a $5,000 couch

38
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,019
Mateo's gonna
jump all over.

39
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:42,199
(knocking on door)

40
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:43,410
Hey, guys...

41
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:44,521
Can you please

42
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,347
tell her that she has
to buy something

43
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:47,371
with her book advance?

44
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,841
Tell him I'm going to after
I finish the first round

45
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:50,989
of notes from my editor.

46
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,967
I just want to make sure
that they like it, since

47
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,091
- they're paying...
- Say it.

48
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:57,379
Half a million dollars!

49
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:58,536
(trilling)

50
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:00,222
(both laughing)

51
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:02,841
Who... what,
are you guys over it already?

52
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:06,706
Actually,
we wanted to have lunch today

53
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:08,185
to tell you something.

54
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,559
Okay.

55
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:16,528
We're...
moving to New York.

56
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:18,245
What?

57
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,399
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>So, yeah.</i>

58
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:21,503
<i>That's the doozy
I was talking about.</i>

59
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:23,563
ROGELIO: <i>This Is Mars</i>
will be filming there.

60
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:25,696
So your mother
graciously offered

61
00:02:25,784 --> 00:02:27,337
to transfer nursing schools.

62
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:29,539
We didn't want to say anything
unless we could convince

63
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:31,526
Darci and Esteban to move.

64
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,050
Your father didn't want to
miss out on Baby' childhood.

65
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:36,401
Not that I want to miss out
on your adulthood.

66
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:39,719
But, uh, New York
is just a short flight away.

67
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:41,358
I get it.

68
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:42,986
Of course.

69
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:47,151
So when are you moving?

70
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,424
Three days
after the wedding.

71
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:51,471
Wow. Okay.

72
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:52,945
Well, it's a good thing

73
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:55,596
that we're not going on
a honeymoon right away.

74
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,591
(crying):
I'm gonna miss you.

75
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:03,352
(crying):
Me, too. So much.

76
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,807
(sobbing)

77
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,246
Oh! I can't believe

78
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:09,592
we won't be in the same city.

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,100
Oh...

80
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:15,189
Oh, no, but...
this is good.

81
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:17,003
This is exciting.

82
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:18,924

Okay, uh, so, we
still have a month.

87
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:31,665
What do we do?

88
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,526
Just live our lives.
You have to finish

89
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,118
- editing your book.
- Exactly.

90
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:37,862
And I'll take the lead
on wedding planning.

91
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:39,792
You okay?

92
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:42,589
I just feel like I'm
already losing time.

93
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,962
<i>It does go quickly, friends,</i>

94
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,876
<i>as you well know.</i>

95
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:54,352
Ah... so that's it.

96
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,696
My book is officially finished.

97
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:59,243
My editor loves the new ending.
And you?

98
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:01,501
I'm, like, 98 and a half
percent there.

99
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:02,790
But I have accepted

100
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,169
I'll never get
to a hundred.

101
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:05,759
Too much anxiety.
The point is,

102
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,260
I've typed "the end," and I'm
on track for a summer release.

103
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,073
Badass.
(chuckles)

104
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:12,705
Does that mean we can
upgrade to a plated dinner?

105
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:14,837
(laughs):
For $26 a head? No way.

106
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,039
My<i> abuela's</i> church friends can
make their way to the buffet.

107
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,549
They've done it before.
But...

108
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:20,077
I'm ready to talk
all things wedding.

109
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:21,841
All right. (sighs)
Let's do this.

110
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,792
God, I love seeing you
with that checklist.

111
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,972
What a turn-on.

112
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,739
Why, thank you. Okay.

113
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:27,948
The caterer has
our deposit.

114
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:29,690
The cake is confirmed
and so is the DJ.

115
00:04:29,778 --> 00:04:31,355
I e-mailed all the
vendors and the guests

116
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:33,059
to remind them that the
marathon is this weekend,

117
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:34,175
so traffic will be crazy.

118
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:35,499
Look at you talking all dirty.

119
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:37,065
Lina has confirmed

120
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:39,130
that the wedding dress
is in transit.

121
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:42,333
And, ah. Now onto
some open questions.

122
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,879
- Hit me with them open questions.
- Are we...

123
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:47,129
sleeping together or apart
the night before the wedding?

124
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:49,049
- Together. Definitely.
- Agreed.

125
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:50,331
And I finished my vows.

126
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:51,987
Mm.
First time I've ever finished

127
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,235
a writing assignment on time.

128
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,825
First time I haven't.

129
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,380
B-Because of my book.

130
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:58,333
Don't worry, I got this.

131
00:04:58,575 --> 00:04:59,888
I'm not worried.

132
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:01,942
But there is one more
thing we have to do.

133
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,163
What?

134
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,950
Practice our dance.

135
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:08,192
♪ ♪

136
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,412
♪ Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm ♪

00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,370
PETRA:
<i>Ew. Way too sweet.</i>

139
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,793
I don't want hearts
on the place cards.

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,377
We're not in third grade.

141
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,535
Are you sure
you don't want to invite

142
00:05:20,622 --> 00:05:21,969
any more people
to the rehearsal dinner?

143
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,995
Hmm? Jane won't have
to spend a dime

144
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,402
of that book money...
It's my treat.

145
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:27,924
Nah. We want to
keep it small.

146
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:29,979
But if<i> you</i> want to
bring a plus-one...

147
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:32,260
Please. That's just not
what I'm about right now.

148
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,179
I am happily married
to the Marbella.

149
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,130
("Wedding March" playing)

150
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,723
(music stops)
Now let's talk schedule.

151
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,795
Cocktail hour will be from 5:00
to 6:00, followed by dinner.

152
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,989
During dinner,
we'll do the toasts.

153
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,440
And yes,

154
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:45,406
- I will be making one.
- Oh, yeah?

155
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:48,739
Yes. And it's going to be
really funny.

156
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,329
JANE:
<i>But Petra's not funny.</i>

157
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,247
<i>I know. But she was so excited,</i>

158
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,369
- so just laugh whenever she pauses.
- <i>I will.</i>

159
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:55,917
Unless she
publicly fires someone.

160
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,028
(chuckles)
How was the dress fitting?

161
00:05:58,137 --> 00:05:59,792
Amazing.
Lina crushed it.

162
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,948
I'm so happy.

163
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:02,471
Oh, I can't wait
to see you in it.

164
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,612
Oh. Love you.
See you at home.

165
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,179
Jane?
Hmm? (gasps)

166
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,393
Hey. I got your e-mail,
and yes, we would love

167
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:10,350
for you to marry our spirits...
Though we are thinking

168
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,706
it's more of an
after-ceremony private thing.

169
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:13,870
Great. Um, but I was

170
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,902
actually hoping to talk to you
about something else.

171
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:17,863
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>Uh-oh. That's never good.</i>

172
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,341
Of course. Sure.
What is it?

173
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:21,747
I found Rafael's birth parents.

174
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,221
<i>Yes, friends,
looks like that last secret</i>

175
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,130
<i>will finally be revealed.</i>

176

NARRATOR:
<i>As you can imagine... or I can...</i>

<i>There are so many ways
a story can end.</i>

178
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,028
You found Rafael's parents?

179
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:37,366
<i>Endings can be dramatic.</i>

180
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:38,567
Are they crime lords?

181
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:40,864
- <i>Or shocking.</i>
- Rose isn't his mother, is she?

182
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:42,505
<i>Or seemingly mundane.</i>

183
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:44,372
His parents were just...

184
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:47,169
regular people.

185
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:49,380
Were?

186
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:51,692
- They're dead.
- <i>Which, of course,</i>

187
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,684
<i>is a different kind
of ending altogether.</i>

188
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:55,081
Oh, no.

189
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:56,924
Here's everything

190
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:58,682
I could find out about them.

191
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,394
I thought...

192
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,260
you should be the one
to tell Rafael.

193
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:15,963
If I'm cold,
I'll go shopping.

194
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:17,612
I hear there are stores
in New York.

195
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,499
Hey. Where's Mateo?
I have to get home to talk to Rafael.

196
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:34,174
Upstairs. He said he's working
on some big surprise for me.

197
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:35,722
(thump)

198
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,796
Wha...?

199
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,721
Mateo, what did you do?

200
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:43,135
I unpacked you,
so now you don't have to move.

201
00:07:43,223 --> 00:07:46,049
<i>Looks like Jane's son
doesn't like goodbyes, either.</i>

202
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,018
Mateo, sweetie,
Abuela still has to move.

203
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:50,156
Why?

204
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:52,877
You know why.
Because of Papa's show.

205
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:54,048
That's why Papa

206
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:56,674
has to move, but Abuela
could stay here with us.

207
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,471
- No, I can't, sweetie.
- Yes, you can.

208
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,889
You just don't want to.

209
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:02,066
- That's not true.
- You could

210
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:04,187
- if you wanted to.
- JANE: It'll be okay, Mateo.

211
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,752
It's just like we talked about.

212
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:08,140
Okay? We'll FaceTime
every night.

213
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:10,331
It's not the same.

214
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:11,979
It's just not.

215
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,695
<i>Yeah, I know
how you feel, buddy.</i>

216
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:19,236
Hey.

217
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:22,027
- What took you guys so long?
- We had a little issue,

218
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:23,885
but we're doing better.
Right, Mr. Sweetface?

219
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:25,838
Can I sleep in bed
with you guys tonight?

220
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:29,096
No fair! If he gets
to, then we do, too.

221
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:32,000
- Yeah. And no tooting, Mateo.
- It's not tooting

222
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:33,368
if I do it in my sleep.

223
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:34,915
- Uh, yes, it is.
- It's still tooting.

224
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:36,845
Official ruling is...

225
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:38,924
- it's tooting!
- Yeah!

226
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:41,183
RAFAEL: Hey, and try not to do
it in your sleep tonight, huh?

227
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,807
So, what do you say?

228
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:44,799
Family sleepover?

229
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:48,315
Okay, let's do it.

230
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:50,924
(cheering)

231
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,190
ROGELIO:
<i>Thank you.</i>

232
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:54,377
You are an excellent agent,
Barry.

233
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:55,682
Okay.

234
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:58,760
The network just dropped
the<i> This Is Mars</i> pilot online

235
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:02,354
to generate some buzz before it
officially starts airing in the fall.

236
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,073
- Wow.
- I just can't believe

237
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:06,471
it's finally being released
to American audiences.

238
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,738
People are watching it
right now.

239
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:09,307
Do you think there's buzz yet?

240
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:11,268
- Probably not.

241
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:13,463

Xo...

242
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:14,884
it's happening.

243
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,768
#Mars is already trending.

244
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,370
America loves me!

245
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,979
Oh. Apparently,
America loves NASA.

246
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:26,604
They just landed
another rover on Mars.

247
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:29,495
Oh, I'll just help you repack
to take my mind off it.

248
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,454
But, I mean,
it's exciting, no?

249
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,432
Lots of big changes ahead.

250
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:38,734
(Jane sighs)

251
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,533
Luisa found my parents?

252
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:45,028
Yes. And I don't know
how to tell you this

253
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:46,979
except to just tell you.

254
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:49,387
They died
in a car accident.

255
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:53,222
Oh.
I am so sorry.

256
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:55,387
They lived in Italy.

257
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:56,582
They owned a bakery.

258
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,050
- It's all in there.
- A bakery.

259
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:01,896
Wow.

260
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:04,388
How normal.

261
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,274
I-I guess I was expecting
something, um...

No.

Actually, it's
the perfect time.

270
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:25,593
I think a few months ago
I would have been devastated.

271
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:28,912
But all I can think
about right now is...

how much I<i> do</i> have.

273
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:34,763
I mean, I am literally
surrounded by family.

even the best part.

One of the authors
is Isabel Allende.

307
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:48,772

Isabel Allende might write

(laughter)
Oh...

320
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:15,084
Which sister gave you an egg?

321
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:17,014
The pretty one, clearly.

322
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:18,849
Alexis?
Jackie.

323
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:20,980
That's what I meant. I just,
I mix them up all the time.

324
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,317
I am so happy for you,

325
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,818
oh, and your very lucky baby.

326
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:26,490
(sniffles)
Okay, enough.

327
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:28,611
I'm supposed to be
gushing about you.

328
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:30,420
<i>(glass clinking)</i>

329
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:33,115
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>Which, for the record, she did.</i>

330
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:36,577
People think I grew up
with four sisters...

331
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:38,208
(chuckles)

332
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:40,935
but the truth is,
I grew up with five.

333
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,365
And I only liked one of them.

334
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:44,566
(laughter)

335
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:45,756
Jane, you are...

336
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,490
everything to me.

337
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:51,888
The person I look up to
the most in this world,

338
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:55,303
the person I want to be
when I grow up.

339
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:57,584
And the one thing
I know...

340
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:02,138
is that, uh,
becoming Jane's father

341
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:04,443
late in life,

342
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:06,529
has been...

343
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:11,060
well, the greatest joy
of my life.

344
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:14,404
It's true. And, uh,

345
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:17,771
tomorrow, I'm so thrilled
to be gaining a son.

346
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:20,865
So, Rafael,

347
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:24,740
I would be honored
if you call me Dad.

348
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,779
U-Uh... Thank you.
(chuckles)

349
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:34,107
Thank you...?

350
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:39,528
Very much.

351
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:41,623
PETRA: Well,
you'll sort that out.

352
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:43,381
(clears throat)
So,

353
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,595
anyway, there's been a lot
of tears shed here tonight,

354
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:48,146
so I think it's time
for some laughs.

355
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:52,337
I always knew Jane
was super into weddings,

356
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,868
because she was always marrying
the ketchups at work.

357
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:58,016
And Rafael, well,
he's always been...

358
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:00,673
Well, his shirts are so tight,

359
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:03,142
(chuckles):
and his pants...

360
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:06,275
It's okay, Petra.

361
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:08,009
You don't have to be funny.

362
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:09,545
No, I wrote these jokes
so I wouldn't

363
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:11,085
get emotional like this.

364
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:13,798
<i>Eh, I don't think it's working.</i>

365
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,697
I just love you two so much.

366
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,736
Your love is something
I aspire to.

367
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:21,415
(both chuckle)

368
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:24,431
And I wish you
all the happiness in the world,

369
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:25,784
which is a really
weird feeling,

370
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,048
because I don't usually wish
happiness on other people.

371
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:29,540
(laughter)

372
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:32,208
I love you.
I love you.

373
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:36,527
Ah...

374
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:39,778
Thank you so much, everyone.

375
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,987
(chuckles): We are just...
(glass clinking)

376
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:46,298
I also want to make a toast.

377
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,853
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

378
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,611
(Luisa clears throat)

379
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:53,251
Jane,
a long time ago,

380
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:55,548
I was going through
a rough time,

381
00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:59,389
and I accidentally
inseminated you.

382
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,993
So I just want to take
this moment to say...

383
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:06,923
you're welcome.

384
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:09,619
(laughter)

385
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,713
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>Suffice it to say,</i>

386
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,090
<i>on that night, there was love.</i>

387
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:21,720
<i>So much in fact, that suddenly
Jane realized something.</i>

388
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:25,136
Mm. You have
that look.

389
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:27,036
- You want to go write?
- Quickly. Is that okay?

390
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,126
- Of course. Go.
- Okay.

391
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:30,916
Ugh.

392
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,230
(clears throat)

393
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,340
So...

394
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,777
you seemed a little
choked up about love.

395
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:42,668
Oh, please. Villanueva events
are<i> made</i> for people to cry.

396
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:44,369
It's just how
they're constructed.

397
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,621
It's fine. I'm fine.

398
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:48,730
Where did Jane run off to?

399
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,238
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>Ah, there she is.</i>

400
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:53,340
Wow.

401
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:55,886
Somebody was inspired
by those speeches.

402
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:58,183
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone

403
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:00,980
that my wife, the writer,
plagiarized her vows.

404
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:04,613
Oh, I wasn't writing my vows.

405
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,016
I, uh... I-I just suddenly got
an idea for the end of my book

406
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:09,668
that would get
me close to 100%,

407
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:12,369
and I e-mailed my editor to
see if she could get the file

408
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:15,388
into the printing press in time
to get it to Isabel Allende.

409
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:17,847
Got it.

410
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,652
I was gonna write my
vows later tonight.

411
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,120
Well, you know
what they say.

412
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,363
It's always best
when you just slip 'em in

413
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:25,324
right under the deadline.

414
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,879
We should get back inside.
Dessert's coming.

415
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:32,566
ROGELIO:
<i>I definitely ate too much cake.</i>

416
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:35,453
Yeah. Me, too.

417
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:38,914
You're upset,
and I get it.

418
00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:41,430
I put Rafael on the spot,
but it came from a good place.

419
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:43,061
Rogelio, it's not that.

420
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,649
I need to tell you something.

421
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:49,703
I don't think
I could move to New York.

422
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:56,366
Wh-What do you mean,
you can't move to New York?

423
00:16:56,454 --> 00:16:59,067
I just don't want
to leave my whole family.

424
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:00,957
And I've been trying
to push that feeling aside

425
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:03,183
and support you, but...
I really don't think

426
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,972
it's the right move for me.

427
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:07,634
I mean, I just started

428
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,542
getting into the groove
with my nursing program.

429
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,417
My life finally feels
like it's on track.

430
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,554
So? So wha-what are you saying?

431
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:15,347
Because I have to go.

432
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:16,637
I signed a contract.

433
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:19,871
Well, I was thinking,

434
00:17:20,228 --> 00:17:21,892
maybe we should commute.

435
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,267
Just for this year.

436
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:26,080
I'll live here
during the week,

437
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:28,166
and we'll travel
to each other on weekends.

438
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:30,712
Think about it.
Your hours are long anyway.

439
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,056
It's not like
I'd even see you

440
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:33,965
during the week
when you're shooting.

441
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,965
I mean, I want you to be happy.

442
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,379
W-Will commuting make you happy?

443
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:40,894
I think it will.

444
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:44,004
Okay. Then...

445
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,525
let's do it.

446
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:46,816
Oh.

447
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,999
Thank you, Rogelio.

448
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,896
(laughs softly)

449
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:58,126
So I finished my vows.

450
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:01,649
And I'm so sorry about earlier.

451
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,026
No. No. I...
I overreacted.

452
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:06,681
Your book is so important.

453
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,948
<i>You're</i> important.

454
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:11,571
I just wasn't worried
about writing my vows

455
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:14,114
because I knew exactly
what I wanted to say.

456
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:17,737
Because I think about how lucky
I am to be with you every day.

457
00:18:17,955 --> 00:18:20,542
And I'm so excited
about our wedding,

458
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,869
but I'm most excited
about our future together.

459
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:25,409
(laughs softly, sniffles)

460
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:28,887
Because it's not like the
telenovelas I grew up watching.

461
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:32,020
The wedding isn't the end.

462
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:34,784
Our story is just beginning.

463
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:36,864
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
<i>Stop rubbing it in!</i>

464
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:38,091
Thanks.

465
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:39,958
(sighs, sputters)

466
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:42,307
I think I'm just feeling
a little vulnerable.

467
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:45,941
You know, last night you told me
my birth parents are dead,

468
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:47,661
and it didn't even faze me.

469
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:51,017
Because of how
much I love you.

470
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,517
(voice breaking): And that's
a lot to put on someone.

471
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:55,192
Not too much.

472
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:57,707
And just because
I can't wait for the future,

473
00:18:57,795 --> 00:18:59,973
I don't want
to skip this moment.

474
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,106
So let's not wait.

475
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:03,823
Let's take our honeymoon
right away.
