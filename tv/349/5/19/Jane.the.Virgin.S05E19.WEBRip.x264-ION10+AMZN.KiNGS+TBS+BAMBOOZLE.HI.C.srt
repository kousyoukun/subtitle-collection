<i>With the friendship...</i>

I'll just ask one

I can say goodbye.

32
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,809
It was our first
big purchase together.

00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,634
How can we just get rid of it?

34
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:33,484
Just think how happy it'll make
someone who didn't

35
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,824
just sign a massive book deal.

36
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:38,814
Come on. You said you wanted
to splurge on something.

37
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:40,949
And I will, just not
a $5,000 couch

to buy something

with her book advance?

44
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,247
Tell him I'm going to after
I finish the first round

45

of notes from my editor.

46
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:54,402
I just want to make sure
that they like it, since

47
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:56,357
- they're paying...
- Say it.

48

Actually, we wanted
to have lunch today

53
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,097

So your mother
graciously offered

61
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,802
to transfer nursing schools.

62
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:30,908
We didn't want to say anything
unless we could convince

63

Darci and Esteban to move.

64
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:35,374
Your father didn't want to
miss out on Baby's childhood.

65
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:37,566
Not that I want to miss out
on your adulthood.

66
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:41,069
But, uh, New York
is just a short flight away.

67

I get it.

00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,977
Of course.

Three days after the wedding.

00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,676
Wow. Okay.

72
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:54,764
Well, it's a good thing

73
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,827
that we're not going on
a honeymoon right away.

You have to finish

- editing your book.
- Exactly.

But I have accepted

I'll never get to a hundred.

99
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:07,084
Too much anxiety.
The point is,

100

and so is the DJ.

I e-mailed all the
vendors and the guests

114

to remind them that the
marathon is this weekend,

- Together. Definitely.
- Agreed.

Hmm? (GASPS) Hey.

166

You know why.
Because of Papa's show.

That's why Papa

Right, Mr. Sweetface?

to, then we do, too.

the person I want to be
when I grow up.

And the one thing I know...

was super into weddings,

No, I wrote these jokes

I could move to New York.

you can't move to New York?

I just don't want
to leave my whole family.

to push that feeling aside
