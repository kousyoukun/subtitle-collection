朋友們  從哪講起呢
Ah, friends. Where to start?

19
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,710
意外的人工授精
With the accidental insemination?

20
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,290
愛的故事
With the love story?

21
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,970
心碎的時刻
With the heartbreak?

22
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,430
J.R.和我分手了
J.R. broke up with me.

23
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,920
友誼
With the friendship...

24
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,150
我會去找我的姐妹們要一個卵子
I'll just ask one of my sisters for an egg.

25
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,860
我不希望讓我們之間的友誼變得復雜
I don't want to complicate our friendship.

26
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,550
婚姻
With the marriages...

27
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,390
家庭
With the family...

28
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,900
職業頂峰
With the career high...

29
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,860
拍賣結束了
The auction's over.

30
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,700
五十萬
$500,000.

31
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,900
你做到了  簡
You did it, Jane.

32
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,520
還是這三個女人
With the three women...

33
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,570
到了最后  還是這三個女人
At the end of the day, those three women.

34
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,650
朋友們  我們從這講起吧
Yes, friends, let's start there.

35
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,530
因為這才是故事的開端
Since that's where our story began...

36
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,050
簡·格洛瑞娜·維蘭紐瓦還很小時
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was a much younger girl,

37
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,220
她得去面對自己想象不到的事
she had to face the unthinkable...

38
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,620
你說電視劇會結束是什么意思
What do you mean the telenovela's gonna end?

39
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,420
他們剛剛解開最后的大謎團
Well, they just revealed the last big secret.

40
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,960
所以說這部劇快要結束了
So the show's almost over.

41
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,050
永遠結束了嗎
Forever?

42
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,800
但琳娜和她的家人一起看《我們的日子》
But Lina watches Days of our Lives with her family,

43
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,760
都看到第三十四季了
and they're on season 34.

44
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,570
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}電視劇是不一樣的  親愛的

45
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,110

49
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,120
是的  朋友們
Yes, friends,

50
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,530
簡從來就不喜歡結局
our Jane never loved endings.

51
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,160
但現在  她卻不得不向美好的事物告別
And yet, here she was, facing a doozy.

52
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,220
{\an8}此時此刻

53
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,200
我舍不得告別
I just don't think I can say goodbye.

54
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,630
舍不得沙發
To the couch?

55
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,800
這是我們一起買的第一個大件
It was our first big purchase together.

56
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,640
我們怎么能就這么扔掉呢
How can we just get rid of it?

57
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,390
想想那些沒有拿到出書合同的人
Just think how happy it'll make someone who didn't

58
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,500
拿到這沙發會有多開心
just sign a massive book deal.

59
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,900
拜托  是你自己說過想奢侈一把的
Come on. You said you wanted to splurge on something.

60
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,940
我會的  但也不能買個給馬特奧跳來跳去的
And I will, just not a $5,000 couch

61
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,720
價值五千的沙發啊
Mateo's gonna jump all over.

62
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,940
大家好啊
Hey, guys...

63
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,610
你們能不能告訴她
Can you please tell her that

64
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,740
她應該用自己的預付款去買些東西
she has to buy something with her book advance?

65
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,030
告訴他  在我完成編輯給我的那些想法之后
Tell him I'm going to after I finish the first round

66
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,410
我會去花的
of notes from my editor.

67
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,910
我只想確保他們喜歡我的書
I just want to make sure that they like it,

68
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,400
-既然他們已經付了  -說吧
- since they're paying... - Say it.

69
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,030
五十萬
...half a million dollars!

70
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,740
怎么了  你們已經興奮過了嗎
Who-- what, are you guys over it already?

71
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,050
其實  我們今天想和你們吃午餐
Actually, we wanted to have lunch today

72
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,250
是想告訴你們一些事
to tell you something.

73
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,540
好吧
Okay.

74
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,710
我們要搬去紐約了
We're... moving to New York.

75
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,810
什么
What?

76
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,810
是的
So, yeah.

77
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,980
這就是我之前說過的壞消息
That's the doozy I was talking about.

78
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,680
《這是火星》會在這里進行拍攝
This Is Mars will be filming there.

79
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,150
所以你媽媽很慷慨地提出
So your mother graciously offered

80
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,780
要轉讀衛校
to transfer nursing schools.

81
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,820
除非可以說服德斯和埃斯特班搬家
We didn't want to say anything unless we could convince

82
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,480
否則我們什么也不想說的
Darci and Esteban to move.

83
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,480
你爸爸不想錯過寶貝的童年
Your father didn't want to miss out on baby's childhood.

84
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,820
并不是說我想錯過你的生活
Not that I want to miss out on your adulthood.

85
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,280
坐飛機很快就能到紐約
But, uh, New York is just a short flight away.

86
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,780
我理解
I get it.

87
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,820
當然
Of course.

88
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,120
你們打算什么時候搬家
So when are you moving?

89
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,660
婚禮后三天
Three days after the wedding.

90
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,540
好吧
Wow. Okay.

91
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,470
這是好事
Well, it's a good thing

92
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,590
我們不需要立刻出發去度蜜月
that we're not going on a honeymoon right away.

93
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,630
我會想你的
I'm gonna miss you.

94
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,430
我也是  很想很想
Me, too. So much.

95
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,610
我不敢相信
Oh! I can't believe

96
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,770
我們不會在同一個城市里居住了
we won't be in the same city.

97
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,440
但這是好事
Oh, no, but... this is good.

98
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,230
很令人激動
This is exciting.

99
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,610
你說是  那就是吧
If you say so.

100
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,370
{\an8}處女情緣

101
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,210
{\an8}再見  簡

102
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,590
{\an8}第一百章

103
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,540
好吧  我們還有一個月時間
Okay, uh, so, we still have a month.

104
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,550
我們該做些什么
What do we do?

105
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,090
好好生活
Just live our lives.

106
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,600
-你需要把書寫完  -沒錯
- You have to finish editing your book. - Exactly.

107
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,880
然后我負責婚禮籌備工作
And I'll take the lead on wedding planning.

108
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,710
你還好嗎
You okay?

109
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,670
我感覺時間過得太快了
I just feel like I'm already losing time.

110
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,390
確實很快  朋友們
It does go quickly, friends,

111
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,640
你們都知道
as you well know.

112
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,740
{\an8}三周半之后

113
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,600
就這樣
Ah... so that's it.

114
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,020
我的書終于寫完了
My book is officially finished.

115
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,440
-我的編輯喜歡新的結局  -你呢
- My editor loves the new ending. ‭- And you?

116
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,830
我大概喜歡百分98.5吧
I'm, like, 98 and a half percent there.

117
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,040
但是我已經接受了
But I have accepted

118
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,580
我永遠也不會完全滿意
I'll never get to a hundred.

119
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,170
太焦慮了  關鍵問題試試
Too much anxiety. The point is,

120
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,750
我已經打了"完結"  準備暑假發行
I've typed "the end," and I'm on track for a summer release.

121
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,780
棒呆了
Badass. ‭

122
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,090
這意味著我們應該吃次正餐嗎
Does that mean we can upgrade to a plated dinner?

123
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,500
26美元一位  不可能
For $26 a head? No way.

124
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,390
我外婆的教堂朋友們能找到方法去吃自助餐
My abuela's church friends can make their way to the buffet.

125
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,790
他們以前干過  但是
They've done it before. But...

126
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,600
我準備好談談婚禮的事情了
I'm ready to talk all things wedding.

127
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,310
好的  開始吧
All right. Let's do this.

128
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,100
天啊  我真是喜歡看你弄清單
God, I love seeing you with that checklist.

129
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,090
真讓人興奮
What a turn-on.

130
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,190
謝謝你  好吧
Why, thank you. Okay.

131
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,320
已經給婚慶公司訂金了
The caterer has our deposit.

132
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,940
蛋糕和DJ都確定了
The cake is confirmed and so is the DJ.

133
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,570
我給供應商和客人都發郵件
I e-mailed all the vendors and the guests

134
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,320
提醒他們馬拉松在這周末
to remind them that the marathon is this weekend,

135
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,660
所以交通狀況會不太好
so traffic will be crazy.

136
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,950
看你巧舌如簧
Look at you talking all dirty.

137
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,370
琳娜確認
Lina has confirmed

138
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,610
禮服在運輸途中
that the wedding dress is in transit.

139
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,440
繼續說點開放性問題吧
And, ah. Now onto some open questions.

140
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,420
-你來說點開放性問題吧  -我們
- Hit me with them open questions. - Are we...

141
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,630
婚禮前一天我們分開睡還是一起睡
sleeping together or apart the night before the wedding?

142
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,570
-一起  肯定的  -同意
- Together. Definitely. ‭- Agreed.

143
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,780
我已經宣誓了
And I finished my vows.

144
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,210
有史以來我第一次
Mm. ‭First time I've ever finished

145
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,490
按時完成寫作任務
a writing assignment on time.

146
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,120
我第一次沒有按時完成
First time I haven't.

147
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,620
因為我的書
B-Because of my book.

148
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,580
別擔心  沒問題的
Don't worry, I got this.

149
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,920
我沒有擔心
I'm not worried.

150
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,460
但是我們還需要再做一件事情
But there is one more thing we have to do.

151
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,250
什么
What?

152
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,970
練習舞蹈
Practice our dance.

153
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,680
甜蜜的過分了
Way too sweet.

154
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,110
我不喜歡座位卡上都是心
I don't want hearts on the place cards.

155
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,190
又不是三年級小朋友
We're not in third grade.

156
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,780
你確定你不想邀請
Are you sure you don't want to invite

157
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,360
更多人加入彩排晚餐嗎
any more people to the rehearsal dinner?

158
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,870
簡不需要動她書的錢  我請客
Hmm? Jane won't have to spend a dime of that book money-- it's my treat.

159
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,330
我們想弄小點
Nah. We want to keep it small.

160
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,250
但是如果你想弄大一號
But if you want to bring a plus-one...

161
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,710
那恰恰不是我想要的
Please. That's just not what I'm about right now.

162
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,700
我很高興能夠與瑪貝拉酒店永遠在一起
I am happily married to the Marbella.

163
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,890
{\an8}#佩特拉·瑪貝拉

164
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,890
{\an8}#永遠熱情好客

165
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,210
現在談談時間安排吧
Now let's talk schedule.

166
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,140
雞尾酒會是5點到6點  然后是晚宴
Cocktail hour will be from 5:00 to 6:00, followed by dinner.

167
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,350
晚宴時  我們開始敬酒
During dinner, we'll do the toasts.

168
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,840
沒錯
And yes,

169
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,890
-我也會敬酒  -是嗎
- I will be making one. - ‭Oh, yeah?

170
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,930
是的  而且還會很有趣
Yes. And it's going to be really funny.

171
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,730
但佩特拉并不有趣
But Petra's not funny.

172
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,320
我知道  但是她很激動  所以
I know. But she was so excited, so just laugh

173
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,860
-她停頓的時候笑一笑吧  -我會的
- whenever she pauses. - I will.

174
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,350
除非她當眾開除某人
Unless she publicly fires someone.

175
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,490
禮服合身嗎
How was the dress fitting?

176
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,240
完美  琳娜選的很準
Amazing. Lina crushed it.

177
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,270
我很開心
I'm so happy.

178
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,870
我等不及想看你穿禮服了
Oh, I can't wait to see you in it.

179
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,080
愛你  家里見
Oh. Love you. See you at home.

180
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,030
簡
Jane?

181
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,580
我收到了你的郵件  我們愿意
Hey. I got your e-mail, and yes, we would love

182
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,500
讓你給我們的靈魂證婚  不過我們認為
for you to marry our spirits-- though we are thinking

183
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,090
這更像是婚禮之后私下的事情
it's more of an after-ceremony private thing.

184
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,050
很好  但是我
Great. Um, but I was

185
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,370
其實希望和你談點別的事情
actually hoping to talk to you about something else.

186
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,220
好像不是好事
Uh-oh. That's never good.

187
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,620
當然  什么事情
Of course. Sure. What is it?

188
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,000
我找到了拉斐爾的生父母
I found Rafael's birth parents.

189
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,750
朋友們  看來最后的秘密
Yes, friends, looks like that last secret

190
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,710
最終還是會被揭曉
will finally be revealed.

191
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,320
正如你所想象的  或者是我想象的
As you can imagine-- or I can--

192
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,110
故事可以有很多種結局
there are so many ways a story can end.

193
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,670
你找到拉斐爾的父母了
You found Rafael's parents?

194
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,090
結局可能是戲劇性的
Endings can be dramatic.

195
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,170
他們是黑社會嗎
Are they crime lords?

196
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,970
也可能令人震驚
Or shocking.

197
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,410
蘿絲不是他的母親  對嗎
Rose isn't his mother, is she?

198
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,120
或者看似平凡
Or seemingly mundane.

199
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,830
他的父母曾經是
His parents were just...

200
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,500
普通人
regular people.

201
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,670
曾經是
Were?

202
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,270
-他們去世了  -當然  這是
- They're dead. - Which, of course,

203
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,360
一種完全不同的結局
is a different kind of ending altogether.

204
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,260
天啊
Oh, no.

205
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
這是我能找到的關于他們的一切
Here's everything I could find out about them.

206
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,890
我想
I thought...

207
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,600
應該由你來告訴拉斐爾
you should be the one to tell Rafael.

208
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,120
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}我給你說

209
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,540
{\an8}{\pos(192,199.274)}你得帶一件更暖的外套  希爾瑪拉

210
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,590
冷了我會去買的
If I'm cold, I'll go shopping.

211
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,490
紐約有地方逛
I hear there are stores in New York.

212
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,170
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}好吧

213
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,510
{\an8}{\pos(192,199.274)}確保我聯系你時你不冷

214
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,470
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}我可聽不出區別

215
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,640
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}好呀寶貝

216
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,090
馬特奧在哪兒  我得回家和拉斐爾談談
Hey. Where's Mateo? I have to get home to talk to Rafael.

217
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,090
在樓上  他說他在給我準備一個大驚喜
Upstairs. He said he's working on some big surprise for me.

218
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,800
什
Wha...?

219
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,400
馬特奧  你干了些什么
Mateo, what did you do?

220
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,860
我拆了你的包裹  這樣你就不用搬家了
I unpacked you, so now you don't have to move.

221
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,770
看來簡的兒子也不喜歡離別
Looks like Jane's son doesn't like goodbyes, either.

222
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,040
馬特奧  親愛的  外婆還是得搬家
Mateo, sweetie, Abuela still has to move.

223
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,860
為什么
Why?

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,540
你知道的  因為外公的事業
You know why. Because of Papa's show.

225
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,960
所以外公不得不離開
That's why Papa has to move,

226
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,410
但外婆可以和我們呆在一起
but Abuela could stay here with us.

227
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,130
-不  我不能  親愛的  -是的  你可以
- No, I can't, sweetie. - Yes, you can.

228
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,590
你只是不想
You just don't want to.

229
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,550
-不是這樣的  -你要是想的話當然可以
- That's not true. - ‭You could if you wanted to.

230
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,760
沒關系  馬特奧
It'll be okay, Mateo.

231
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,410
我們說好的
It's just like we talked about.

232
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,540
好嗎  我們每晚都會視頻通話
Okay? We'll FaceTime every night.

233
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,810
這不一樣
It's not the same.

234
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,460
不一樣
It's just not.

235
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,800
我知道你的感受  伙計
Yeah, I know how you feel, buddy.

236
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,970
嘿
Hey.

237
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,570
-你們怎么才來  -我們有點小問題
- What took you guys so long? - We had a little issue,

238
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,490
但我們好多了  對吧笑瞇瞇先生
but we're doing better. Right, Mr. Sweetface?

239
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,480
今晚我能和你們一起睡在床上嗎
Can I sleep in bed with you guys tonight?

240
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,660
這不公平  如果他可以  那么我們也要一起
No fair! If he gets to, then we do, too.

241
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,660
-就是  別大吵大鬧的  馬特奧  -說夢話
- Yeah. And no tooting, Mateo. - ‭It's not tooting

242
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,000
才不吵呢
if I do it in my sleep.

243
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,210
沒錯  就是很吵
Uh, yes, it is. It's still tooting.

244
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,900
我的決定是
Official ruling is...

245
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,630
-聽你們的  -太好了
- it's tooting! - ‭Yeah!

246
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,700
今晚睡覺的時候別這么做
Hey, and try not to do it in your sleep tonight, huh?

247
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,910
你覺得呢
So, what do you say?

248
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,120
家人之夜
Family sleepover?

249
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,790
好那就這樣吧
Okay, let's do it.

250
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,670
謝謝你
Thank you.

251
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,020
巴里  你是個出色的經紀人
You are an excellent agent,  Barry.

252
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,760
好的
Okay.

253
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,270
為了吸引注意力  電視臺在秋季播出前
The network just dropped the This Is Mars pilot online

254
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,010
發布了《這是火星》的線上試播集
to generate some buzz before it officially starts airing in the fall.

255
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,030
真不敢相信它終于在美國開播了
I just can't believe it's finally being released to American audiences.

256
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,410
人們正在觀看呢
People are watching it right now.

257
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,640
你覺得會受歡迎嗎
Do you think there's buzz yet?

258
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,190
可能不會
Probably not.

259
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,440
希爾
Xo...

260
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,450
我說的沒錯
it's happening.

261
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,410
#火星這個標簽火起來了
Mars is already trending.

262
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,820
美國果然是愛我的
America loves me!

263
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,740
好像大家愛的是宇航局
Oh. Apparently, America loves NASA.

264
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,120
又有一輛火星車在火星著陸了
They just landed another rover on Mars.

265
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,210
我來幫你打包  換個話題
Oh, I'll just help you repack to take my mind off it.

266
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,050
但這令人很激動  不是嗎
But, I mean, it's exciting, no?

267
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,710
未來可期
Lots of big changes ahead.

268
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,760
路易莎找到我父母了
Luisa found my parents?

269
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,400
對  但我不知道除了直說以外
Yes. And I don't know how to tell you this

270
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,850
還能怎么告訴你
except to just tell you.

271
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,930
他們死于車禍
They died in a car accident.

272
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,730
我很遺憾
‭I am so sorry.

273
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,370
他們住在意大利
They lived in Italy.

274
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,120
他們擁有一家面包店
They owned a bakery.

275
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,990
-就是這樣  -面包店
- It's all in there. - ‭A bakery.

276
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,490
也太平凡無奇了
How normal.

277
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,840
我猜我大概是在期待一些
I-I guess I was expecting something,

278
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,450
肥皂劇的情節
Straight out of a telenovela?

279
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,160
更大的
bigger.

280
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,580
更瘋狂的事
Crazier.

281
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,080
被我說中了
Like I said.

282
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,170
我知道現在是得知這件事的最差時機
I know it's a terrible time to find out,

283
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,380
畢竟馬上就要舉辦婚禮了
right before the wedding.

284
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,500
不
No.

285
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,340
事實上  現在是最佳時機
Actually, it's the perfect time.

286
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,180
要是在幾個月前  我可能會很絕望
I think a few months ago I would have been devastated.

287
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,970
但我現在所能想到的全部就是
But all I can think about right now is...

288
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,310
我擁有多少東西
how much I do have.

289
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,230
我確實被家人環繞
I mean, I am literally surrounded by family.

290
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,110
所以我除了感激之外還能有何感受呢
So how can I feel anything but gratitude?

291
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,150
虛晃一槍  但畢竟箭在弦上
It's like Chekhov's gun.

292
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,700
不得不發啦
Had to go off!

293
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,740
我迫不及待地想嫁給你了
I can't wait to marry you.

294
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,490
這就帶我們來到了
Which brings us to...

295
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,180
簡  走快點
Jane, walk faster.

296
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,600
姑娘們  回去那邊
Girls, get back here.

297
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,350
馬特奧  你怎么脫了褲子
Mateo, why are your pants off?

298
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,880
幸好  只是彩排而已
Luckily, just the rehearsal.

299
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,850
{\an8}{\pos(192,199.274)}為什么沒人把這當回事

300
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,670
因為這已經是第三次走過場了  外婆
Because this is the third run-through, Abuela.

301
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,840
不用怕
Never fear,

302
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,270
{\an8}羅格里奧的媽媽

303
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,550
我來了
I am here.

304
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,190
你好啊  媽媽
Hello, Mother.

305
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,640
過來  我的帥小伙兒
Come here, my beautiful boy.

306
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,350
我想死你了
I have missed you so much.

307
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,910
我要在婚禮上朗誦
I'm gonna do a reading at the wedding.

308
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,080
那你可要好好練習聲音的投射
Then you have to practice projection,

309
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,900
讓位置不好的觀眾也能聽到你的聲音
so they can hear you from the cheap seats.

310
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,610
你好  親愛的
Hello, darling.

311
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,420
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}行了  我們結束了

312
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,240
所以  你寫誓詞了嗎
So, have you written your vows yet?

313
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,330
今晚就寫
Tonight.

314
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,080
天哪
Oh, my God.

315
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,640
出版社這周要印刷
The publisher is printing

316
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,060
我那本書的試閱本
advanced galleys of my book this week.

317
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,880
送去給作家們評論
They're sending them to authors to review.

318
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,980
什么  太好了
What?! That's amazing.

319
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,510
但等等  這還不是最棒的
But wait, that's not even the best part.

320
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,930
其中一位作家是伊莎貝爾·阿連德
One of the authors is Isabel Allende.

321
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,930
{\an8}著名女作家  代表作《幽靈之家》  被譽為"穿裙子的加西亞·馬爾克斯"

322
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,150
伊莎貝爾·阿連德也許會
‭Isabel Allende might write

323
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,180
寫一段我書背后的簡介
a blurb for the back of my book!

324
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,100
琳娜  你沒事吧
Lina, are you okay?

325
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,060
沒事  抱歉  我挺好的
Yes. I'm sorry. I'm fine.

326
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,060
繼續說
Go on.

327
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,690
伊莎貝拉什么的  耶
Isabel Something. Yay!

328
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,540
好吧  我本來打算等到婚禮結束
Okay, I was gonna wait until after the wedding

329
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,820
再告訴你的  但是
to tell you, but...

330
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,490
-我懷孕啦  -天哪  恭喜
- I'm pregnant. - Oh, my God. Congratulations.

331
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,580
是哪個姐妹給你的卵子
Which sister gave you an egg?

332
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,420
很明顯是更好看的那個
The pretty one, clearly.

333
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,600
-亞歷克西斯嗎  -是杰姬
- Alexis? - Jackie.

334
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,420
我就這意思  我一直搞混她倆
That's what I meant. I just, I mix them up all the time.

335
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,980
我真為你感到高興
I am so happy for you,

336
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,590
還有你這個超幸運的小孩
and your very lucky baby.

337
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,270
好啦  夠了
Okay, enough.

338
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,090
我該滔滔不絕地發表一些關于你的感言了
I'm supposed to be gushing about you.

339
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,930
準確來說  她還真這么做了
Which, for the record, she did.

340
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,100
大家都覺得我和四個姐姐一起長大
People think I grew up with four sisters...

341
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,770
但事實上  我有五個姐姐
but the truth is, I grew up with five.

342
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,690
而我只喜歡其中一個
And I only liked one of them.

343
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,330
簡  你對我來說
Jane, you are...

344
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,860
意味著一切
everything to me.

345
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,240
你是我在這個世界上最佩服的人
The person I look up to the most in this world,

346
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,490
我長大后想成為你這樣的人
the person I want to be when I grow up.

347
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,430
我只知道一件事
And the one thing I know...

348
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,540
那就是  在晚年
is that, becoming Jane's father

349
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,500
成為簡的父親
late in life,

350
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,510
是我
has been...

351
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,260
這輩子最大的樂趣
well, the greatest joy of my life.

352
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,110
這話是真的  并且
It's true. And,

353
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,140
明天  我也很開心我會有個兒子
tomorrow, I'm so thrilled to be gaining a son.

354
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,270
那么  拉斐爾
So, Rafael,

355
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,440
如果你能叫我一聲爸爸  我將不勝榮幸
I would be honored if you call me Dad.

356
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,070
謝謝你
Thank you.

357
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,370
謝謝你  然后呢
Thank you...?

358
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,000
非常感謝
Very much.

359
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,210
你會搞明白的
Well, you'll sort that out.

360
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,920
那么
So,

361
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,170
總之  今晚大家也哭哭啼啼這么久了
anyway, there's been a lot of tears shed here tonight,

362
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,460
那我覺得也是時候來一點歡笑了
so I think it's time for some laughs.

363
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,980
我一直都知道簡很著迷于婚禮
I always knew Jane was super into weddings,

364
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,140
因為她上班時總是和番茄醬結婚
because she was always marrying the ketchups at work.

365
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,390
拉斐爾  他一直都...
And Rafael, well, he's always been...

366
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,190
他的襯衫太緊了
Well, his shirts are so tight,

367
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,100
而且他的褲子...
 and his pants...

368
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,960
沒關系  佩特拉
It's okay, Petra.

369
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,580
你不必要說的很搞笑
You don't have to be funny.

370
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,140
不
No,

371
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,850
我就是為了不像這樣激動才寫了這些笑話
I wrote these jokes so I wouldn't get emotional like this.

372
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,790
我覺得好像這樣沒效果
Eh, I don't think it's working.

373
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,450
我只是太喜歡你們兩個了
I just love you two so much.

374
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,620
你的愛情正是我所渴望的
Your love is something I aspire to.

375
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,100
我還在祝你們一切幸福
And I wish you all the happiness in the world,

376
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,410
這種感覺真是太奇怪了
which is a really weird feeling,

377
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,860
因為我通常不會祝別人幸福
because I don't usually wish happiness on other people.

378
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,400
-我愛你  -我也愛你
- I love you. ‭- I love you.

379
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,450
非常感謝各位
Thank you so much, everyone.

380
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,630
我們只是...
We are just...

381
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,850
我也想說一段祝酒詞
I also want to make a toast.

382
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,620
簡  很久以前
Jane, a long time ago,

383
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,250
我經歷了一段艱難的時光
I was going through a rough time,

384
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,930
而且我不小心讓你受孕了
and I accidentally inseminated you.

385
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,940
所以我想趁此時機說...
So I just want to take this moment to say...

386
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,560
不用謝
you're welcome.

387
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,080
簡單地說  那天晚上  充滿了愛
Suffice it to say, on that night, there was love.

388
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,750
實際上  簡突然意識到了一些事
So much in fact, that suddenly Jane realized something.

389
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,810
你又有那種表情了
You have that look.

390
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,610
-你想去寫作嗎  -很快就好  可以嗎
- You want to go write? - Quickly. Is that okay?

391
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,240
-當然  去吧  -好的
- Of course. Go. - ‭Okay.

392
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,850
那么
So...

393
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,410
看起來你為愛哽咽了
you seemed a little choked up about love.

394
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,220
拜托  維蘭紐瓦的事就是會讓人們哭的
Oh, please. Villanueva events are made for people to cry.

395
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,700
它們就是為此而打造的
It's just how they're constructed.

396
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,780
沒事  我很好
It's fine. I'm fine.

397
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,450
簡跑到哪里去了
Where did Jane run off to?

398
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,500
她在這
There she is.

399
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,580
看來有人被這些祝酒詞激發了靈感
Somebody was inspired by those speeches.

400
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,700
別擔心  我不會告訴別人
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone

401
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,610
我的作家妻子  抄襲了她自己的誓言
that my wife, the writer, plagiarized her vows.

402
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,390
我不是在寫我的結婚誓言
Oh, I wasn't writing my vows.

403
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,330
我只是突然想到了該怎么寫書的結尾
I, uh... I-I just suddenly got an idea for the end of my book

404
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,380
這樣我就能達到100%了
that would get me close to 100%,

405
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,780
然后發給我的編輯  看她能不能及時將文件
and I e-mailed my editor to see if she could get the file

406
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,100
送去打印店  然后再拿給伊莎貝爾·阿連德
into the printing press in time to get it to Isabel Allende.

407
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,390
明白了
Got it.

408
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,000
我本來打算今晚晚點再寫我的誓言
I was gonna write my vows later tonight.

409
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,510
你懂的  人們常說
Well, you know what they say.

410
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,670
卡著截止時間交的作品
It's always best when you just slip 'em in

411
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,420
才是最棒的
right under the deadline.

412
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,260
我們應該回去了  要上甜點了
We should get back inside. Dessert's coming.

413
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,980
我肯定吃了太多蛋糕
I definitely ate too much cake.

414
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,670
我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

415
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,530
你很難過  我能理解
You're upset, and I get it.

416
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,050
我是讓拉斐爾為難了  但也是出于好心
I put Rafael on the spot, but it came from a good place.

417
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,580
羅格里奧  不是這件事
Rogelio, it's not that.

418
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,270
我要給你說件事
I need to tell you something.

419
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,380
我想我不會搬去紐約
I don't think I can move to New York.

420
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,980
什么意思  你不能搬去紐約嗎
Wh-What do you mean, you can't move to New York?

421
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,030
我只是不想離開我的家人
I just don't want to leave my whole family.

422
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,150
而且我一直在試著將這種感覺放到一邊
And I've been trying to push that feeling aside

423
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,230
來支持你  但是我真的認為
and support you, but... I really don't think

424
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,750
對我來說  這不是正確的選擇
it's the right move for me.

425
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,890
我的護校學習
I mean, I just started

426
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,170
才剛剛順利開始
getting into the groove with my nursing program.

427
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,180
我的生活終于回到了正軌
My life finally feels like it's on track.

428
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,990
那你什么意思
So? So wha-what are you saying?

429
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,130
我必須得走
Because I have to go.

430
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,670
因為我簽了一份合同
I signed a contract.

431
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
我在想
Well, I was thinking,

432
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,490
也許我們能經常來往
maybe we should commute.

433
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,170
就這一年
Just for this year.

434
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,110
工作日我會住在這
I'll live here during the week,

435
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,740
到了周末  我們會去輪流看望彼此
and we'll travel to each other on weekends.

436
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,420
考慮一下吧  反正你的時間很長
Think about it. Your hours are long anyway.

437
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,240
也不用在周中你拍戲的時候來看你
It's not like I'd even see you during the week when you're shooting.

438
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,470
我希望你幸福
I mean, I want you to be happy.

439
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,020
這樣通勤會讓你幸福嗎
W-Will commuting make you happy?

440
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,390
我想會的
I think it will.

441
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,470
那好吧
Okay. Then...

442
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,250
就這樣吧
let's do it.

443
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,180
謝謝你  羅格里奧
Thank you, Rogelio.

444
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,380
我寫完了我的婚禮誓言
So I finished my vows.

445
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,370
之前那事我很抱歉
And I'm so sorry about earlier.

446
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,120
不  不  是我反應過度了
No. No. I... I overreacted.

447
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,410
你的書非常重要
Your book is so important.

448
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,290
你才非常重要
You're important.

449
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,060
我并不擔心該怎么寫我的誓言
I just wasn't worried about writing my vows

450
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,500
因為我很清楚我想說些什么
because I knew exactly what I wanted to say.

451
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,220
因為我覺得
Because I think about

452
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,630
能每天和你在一起都是多么的幸運
how lucky I am to be with you every day.

453
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,080
我非常期待我們的婚禮
And I'm so excited about our wedding,

454
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,200
但我對我們的未來感到非常興奮
but I'm most excited about our future together.

455
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,230
因為這不像是我從小到大所看的肥皂劇
Because it's not like the telenovelas I grew up watching.

456
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,550
婚禮并不是結束
The wedding isn't the end.

457
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,650
我們的故事才剛剛開始
Our story is just beginning.

458
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,350
別再提了
Stop rubbing it in!

459
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,410
謝謝
Thanks.

460
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,540
我覺得我有點脆弱
I think I'm just feeling a little vulnerable.

461
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,520
昨晚你告訴我  我的生父母去世了
You know, last night you told me my birth parents are dead,

462
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,100
但這并沒有讓我感到慌亂
and it didn't even faze me.

463
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,660
因為我很愛你
Because of how much I love you.

464
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,250
這對一個人來講真的太多了
And that's a lot to put on someone.

465
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,550
沒那么多
Not too much.

466
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,310
只是因為我等不及未來了
And just because I can't wait for the future,

467
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,510
我不想跳過這個時刻
I don't want to skip this moment.

468
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,900
那我們就別等了
So let's not wait.

469
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,660
我們直接去度蜜月吧
Let's take our honeymoon right away.

470
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,930
天哪  最終我們要大肆揮霍了嗎
OMG. Is it finally time for that big splurge?

471
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,010
因為我們從來沒去度過假
And because we never go on vacations,

472
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,230
我在航班還有酒店預定上有一百萬個積分
I have a million points for flights and hotels,

473
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,590
所以我們幾乎不用花錢
so we'll barely pay for any of it.

474
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,260
應該不用
Nope, guess not.

475
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,550
我加入
I'm in.

476
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,250
不
Oh, no.

477
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,970
你得走了
You have to go.

478
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,450
轉身回了家
Turn around and go back home.

479
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,000
你好  媽媽
Hello to you, too, Ma.

480
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,940
外婆叫我來的
Abuela called.

481
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,240
謝謝你  外婆
Thank you, Abuela.

482
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,300
你不打算走是什么意思
What do you mean you're not moving?

483
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,210
我考慮過了  這不是我想要的
I thought about it, and it's just not what I want.

484
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,240
我是說  我不該顛倒我的生活
I mean, I shouldn't have to upend my life.

485
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,000
現在不是二十世紀五十年代了
This isn't the 1950s.

486
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,990
你一直想上衛校
You were the one who looked into nursing schools.

487
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,090
你說你想去的
You said you wanted to go.

488
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,420
我改變主意了  我想待在這
And I changed my mind. I want to stay here.

489
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,830
因為馬特奧把你嚇壞了
Because Mateo freaked out?

490
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,100
他是個孩子  媽
He's a kid, Ma.

491
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,470
他也是對的
He's also right.

492
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,810
如果我不想我就不用去  我不想去
I don't have to go if I don't want to, and I don't.

493
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,790
我想待在這見證一些事  比如你的書出版了
I want to be here for things like your book coming out,

494
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,180
還有晚餐  生日聚會
and-and dinners and birthdays, and-and...

495
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,990
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}你被嚇壞了

496
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,130
我太愚蠢了
I'm so stupid.

497
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,980
我四十六歲了  我這一輩子
I'm 46 years old, and I've lived near you

498
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,750
都生活在你身邊  媽媽
for my whole life, Mom.

499
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,030
你這輩子也是
And for your whole life.

500
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,860
你會想起我們的簡并不喜歡結局
You'll recall our Jane wasn't fond of endings.

501
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,120
現在呢  就這么結束了
And now what? That's just over?

502
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,490
她從她媽媽身上遺傳的品質
A trait she got from her mother.

503
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,500
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}不

504
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,550
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}它會改變

505
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,250
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}那才是可怕的

506
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,570
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}但如果我能來到這個國家

507
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,390
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}重新再來

508
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,210
{\an8}{\pos(192,199.274)}你肯定會在紐約做同樣的事

509
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,160
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}被嚇到也沒關系  希爾瑪拉

510
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,450
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}但是

511
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,330
{\an8}{\pos(192,199.274)}讓恐懼再影響到我們的生活可就不好了

512
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,330
你會和我一起去紐約嗎
You're coming with me to New York?!

513
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,960
天哪  我太榮幸了
Oh, thank God. I'm so glad.

514
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,110
我太愛你了
I love you so much.

515
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,780
我也愛你
And I love you, too!

516
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,680
謝謝
Oh. Uh, thanks.

517
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,640
你在這做什么呢
What are you doing here?

518
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,060
我只是過來
Oh. Oh, I just... I just came...

519
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,770
給你這個  為了明天的婚禮
to give you this... for the wedding tomorrow.

520
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,230
那是條  項鏈
Is that a... necklace?

521
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,190
我沒打算戴什么首飾
Uh, I... I wasn't planning on wearing any jewelry.

522
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,520
這是新娘套索
It's a lazo de novia.

523
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,800
是一條墨西哥式婚禮念珠
It's a Mexican wedding lasso.

524
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,550
婚禮的時候  親友們把它繞到新郎新娘身上
Loved ones place it around the bride and groom

525
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,370
這是結合的象征
during the ceremony as a symbol of unity.

526
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,680
我父親把它給我的
My-my father gave it to me,

527
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,350
現在  我想把它傳給你
and now, I will like to pass it on to you.

528
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,760
謝謝
Thank you. ‭Yeah.

529
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,100
同時  我想道歉
Also, I wanted to apologize.

530
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,370
我讓你因為叫我爸爸這些事而感到為難
I put you on the spot with the whole "Dad" Thing.

531
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:00,720
沒事
I appreciate that.

532
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,250
但我們現在是在私下里  所以
But we're in private now, so...

533
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,430
如果你想試試
if you want to try it out, that's...

534
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,340
對不起
I'm sorry.

535
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,530
這不是什么張嘴就來的事
It just doesn't really roll off the tongue,

536
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,770
但你知道我愛你
but you know I love you.

537
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,900
{\an8}九百六十萬粉絲  五萬五千三百八十二人正在關注

538
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,150
一切都好嗎
Is everything okay?

539
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,270
不知道  我火了
I don't know. I'm... I'm blowing up.

540
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:33,700
{\an8}一千二百七十萬粉絲  五萬五千三百八十二人正在關注

541
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,550
線上有事發生  但是
Something's happening online, but...

542
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,960
朋友們  這時他才意識到...
And, friends, that's when he realized...

543
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,530
天啊
Oh, my God.

544
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,540
我的粉絲量在暴漲
My social media is exploding.

545
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,130
已經雙倍
I'm doubling--

546
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,820
不  變成三倍了
no, tripling in followers.

547
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,550
也就是說人們肯定在看《這是火星》試播集
Which means people must be watching the This Is Mars pilot.

548
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,200
也許就是現在了  拉斐爾
This could be it, Rafael.

549
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,300
我可能在美國走紅了
I-I could be breaking through in America.

550
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,110
希望如此
Well, I hope so.

551
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,010
是啊  我也一樣
Oh, yeah, me, too.

552
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,870
不過這事我們暫且保密
But-but-but we should keep this between us right now

553
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,270
因為我不想搶了簡的風頭
because I-I don't want to steal Jane's thunder, you know.

554
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,780
她明天就要結婚了
She's getting married tomorrow.

555
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
我也是
As am I.

556
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,580
不敢相信
I can't believe it.

557
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,530
這是我們共度的最后一晚了
Our last night together.

558
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,950
我知道
I know.

559
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,850
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}行了

560
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,390
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}你們倆別哭了

561
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,640
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}明天可是簡的大喜之日

562
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,060
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}該睡覺咯

563
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,810
哎呀
Ah, man.

564
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,230
誰忘記關燈了
Who didn't turn out the lights?

565
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,550
明天可是我大喜的日子呢
Hey, I have a big day tomorrow, remember?

566
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,580
我要搬走了  心里難過著呢
I'm moving, it's so hard.

567
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,090
好  好
Okay, okay.

568
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,110
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}我來關

569
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,610
愛你喲  外婆
Love you, Abuela.

570
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,500
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}這是我在你受洗那天讀的講稿

571
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,000
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}你可以在簡的受洗儀式上讀

572
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,500
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}畫出十字

573
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,690
我深深感受到了屋里充滿的關愛與支持
I am overwhelmed by the love and support in this room.

574
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,480
朋友們  曾經
Once upon a time, friends,

575
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,400
也有這樣的一刻
there was this very moment...

576
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,430
但可惜  那一刻已經過去
But alas, the moment is already gone.

577
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,200
沒事吧
Everything okay?

578
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,180
是我的編輯
My editor.

579
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,230
這不重要
It's not important.

580
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,260
今天我眼里...
Today is about...

581
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,000
只有他
Him.

582
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,490
嗨  我的新郎
Hey, there, my groom.

583
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,780
我的準新娘  新婚快樂
Hey, bride-to-be, happy wedding day.

584
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,880
根據預定計劃
So, according to the schedule,

585
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,420
發型師和化妝師應該就快...
hair and makeup should be arriving...

586
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,820
他們正好來了
Ah, they just got here.

587
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,940
太好了
Oh, great.

588
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,660
你的編輯及時收到你的更改內容了嗎
And did your editor get your changes in time?

589
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,070
沒有  不過這不重要啦
No, but you know what? It's fine.

590
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,090
他們會在正式印刷時換過來的
They'll make the switch when they print the real book.

591
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,640
可伊莎貝爾·阿連德呢  她不肯看你的結局
But what about Isabel Allende? She won't read your ending.

592
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,560
你肯定能做些什么吧
There must be something you can do.

593
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,880
那就只能親手把U盤
Nothing short of hand-delivering a flash drive

594
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,120
送到印刷廠了
to the printing press.

595
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,000
我當然不會在新婚之日去送
Which I would never do on our wedding day.

596
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,840
別擔心
Don't worry.

597
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,190
我可不打算今天跑去經歷什么奇遇
I have no interest in running off on some crazy adventure today.

598
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,180
我們祭壇上見
I'll see you at the altar.

599
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,040
我愛你
I love you.

600
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,200
我也愛你
I love you, too.

601
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,530
她或許沒這打算
Well, she might not be interested,

602
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,690
可看起來他有
but it looks like he is.

603
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,270
有人嗎  有人嗎
Hello? Hello?

604
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,270
{\an8}蒂莫西與湯普森出版社

605
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,080
您有事嗎
Uh, can I help you?

606
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,480
停止出版
Stop the presses.

607
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,080
他們都這樣說吧
Isn't that what they say?

608
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,890
二十年代才這么說吧
In the 1920s.

609
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,710
不好意思
I'm sorry.

610
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,890
我想請您幫個大忙
I-I have a-a huge favor to ask you.

611
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,850
{\an8}三十分鐘后

612
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,030
真是多謝了  老兄
Oh, hey, thanks again, man.

613
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,080
-你幫了我大忙了  -不客氣
- You're a lifesaver. - ‭No problem.

614
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,780
-祝你好運  兄弟  -謝謝
- Hey, good luck, buddy. - ‭Thank you!

615
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,380
有人嗎
Hello?

616
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:33,970
有人嗎
Hello!

617
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,420
不管了
Ah, screw it.

618
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,300
看來簡得花大錢賠那道門了
Guess Jane's splurging on that gate.

619
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,340
嗨  準老公
Hi, almost-husband.

620
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,070
別擔心  我進展順利
Don't worry, I'm right on schedule.

621
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,130
我們的計劃可能要有所改變
Yeah, our schedule might have to change a little.

622
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,680
我被抓了  得有人把我保釋出來
I got arrested and I need to be bailed out.

623
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,730
說到家庭故事
Speaking of family stories,

624
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,490
這個故事將經常被談起
this one would be repeated often.

625
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,120
他開車沖過了那道門
And then he drove his car through the gate

626
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,230
然后被抓了  我得去把他保出來
and got arrested so I have to go get him.

627
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,210
可老媽開走了車去接喬治了
But Mom took the car to pick up Jorge.

628
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,260
我再叫輛車
I'll call a car.

629
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,550
等等  簡  我去吧
Jane, wait, let me go.

630
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,730
-今天是你的婚禮  -所以必須我去
- It's your wedding. - That's why it has to be me.

631
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,210
拉弗真是太浪漫了
What Raf did was so romantic,

632
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,080
必須是我去接他
I have to be the one to go get him!

633
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,790
是啊
Sure.

634
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,120
還能出什么問題
What could go wrong?

635
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,150
{\an8}十分種路程

636
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,440
怎么回事
Wha...?

637
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,150
菲利普  怎么了
Philipe, hey. What's going on?

638
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,270
軟件上說你離我十分種路程遠
It's been saying you're ten minutes away

639
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,390
這都過去二十分鐘了
for about 20 minutes now.

640
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,430
因為馬拉松比賽  我過不去
I can't get to you because of the marathon.

641
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,430
能在普利茅斯街上車嗎
Can you meet me on Plymouth Street?

642
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,080
離你只有幾個街區遠
It's just a few blocks away.

643
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,680
好
Uh, y-yeah, sure.

644
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,880
我這就過去
I-I'll be right there.

645
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,540
抱歉
Yeah. Oh. Yikes!

646
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,480
借過一下
Coming through!

647
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,860

00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,620
謝謝
Thank you.

649
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,060
今天我結婚
It's my wedding day!

650
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,520
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

651
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,380
加油
Got it! You got it!

652
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,560
-別停下  -謝謝
- Keep going. - ‭Thank you.

653
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,300
{\an8}司機已取消行程

654
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,990
菲利普
Ah, Philipe.

655
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,800
突然之間
And suddenly, in a moment

656
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,980
不知是巧合還是一場巨大的計劃
of sheer coincidence or part of the grand plan all along...

657
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,670
上車吧  簡
Hop on, Jane.

658
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,470
{\an8}還有十五站

659
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,740
抱歉  有沒有什么辦法
I am so sorry, but is there any way

660
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,610
能直接繞路
that we could make a quick detour

661
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,940
去警察局
and stop at the police station?

662
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,200
長這么大
After all this time,

663
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,010
她還不知道什么是公交車嗎
doesn't she know how buses work?

664
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,300
我今天結婚
You see, I'm getting married today and, well,

665
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,890
我和我的未婚夫經歷了很多事
my fiancé and I have been through so much.

666
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,960
意外人工授精  綁架  邪惡雙胞胎
An accidental insemination, a kidnapping, an evil twin,

667
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,160
起死回生的丈夫
a husband returning from the dead

668
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,820
這是我們最后的障礙了
and this is our last obstacle.

669
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,990
求求你  能幫幫我嗎

670
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,700
不行
No.

671
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,650
我愿意用五千塊租下整輛車
I will pay you $5,000 to rent out the whole bus.

672
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,950
看來簡終于決定怎么揮霍這筆錢了
Guess Jane's finally decided what to splurge on.

673
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,180

676
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,180
一百
A hundred?

677
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,210
我還有事要做  女士

682
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,380

683
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,360
太棒了
Ah, great!

684
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,960
去警察局
To the police station.

685
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,470
可以了
All right, we're good.

686
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,060
媽媽

你們在哪兒  我們等著你們呢

我這就過去  我接到新郎了
I'm coming and I got the groom.

689
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,610

690
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,440
你開什么車  夠大嗎
W-What are you driving? Is it big enough?

691
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,810
絕對夠大
Oh, yeah, I-it's big enough.

692
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,760
讓一讓
Make way! Make way!

保護婚紗
Save the dress!

696
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,110
朋友們  就在這時
And, friends, that's when...

697
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,520
你是羅格里奧·維嘉吧
Aren't you Rogelio De La Vega

698
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,620
剛播的那部《這是火星》
from that show that just dropped--

699
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,770
里面的那個人
the dude from This Is Mars.

700
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,040
沒錯  你很搞笑
Oh, yeah. You're hilarious, man.

701
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,840
沒錯  就是我
Yes, yes, it is I.

704
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,090
提前嘗鮮一下吧
In fact, here's a little taste of what's to come.

705
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,480
快過來[轉型]
Cross over!

706
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:43,780
是啊
Yes.

707
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,250
快過來
Come on! Hurry!

708
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,800
抱歉
Oh! Excuse me.

709
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,800
簡  我們到了  你們在哪兒
Jane, we're here. Where are you?

710
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,190
媽媽
Mom!

711
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,440
我們走
Let's go!

712
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,020
夫人  你站在這里
Ma'am-- you, stand right here.

713
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,070
先生  能站在這里嗎
Sir, can you stand right here, please?

714
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,550
但也別看  轉過去
But don't look, either. Turn around.

715
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,880
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}站進來

716
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,340
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}但把裙子提起來

717
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,070
紅燈停車了  把眼線筆給我
Oh, red light. Hand me the eyeliner.

718
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,360
你們在后面怎么樣
How's it going back there?

719
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,280
不  不要看
No! Don't look!

720
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,320
你瘋了嗎
Are you crazy?

721
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,000
要幫忙嗎
You need help?

722
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,120
好  謝謝
Oh, yeah, thank you.

723
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,090
{\an8}離婚禮還有0分鐘

724
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,930
這下我們真遲到了
Okay, we are now officially late.

725
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,250
別緊張  你們沒到  他們不會開始的
Don't sweat it; they won't start without you.

726
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,870
以前我當新郎的時候也緊張
I was a nervous groom once, too, you know.

727
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,530
還是三次  但誰記著這種事呢
Actually, three times, but who's counting?

728
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,830
但是你們會完婚
But you are going to get there,

729
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,230
會幸福美滿地在一起
and you are going to be so happy together.

730
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,640
當然不總是美滿
Not always, of course.

731
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,990
有時  會遇到不順的事
At times, things will be difficult.

732
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,080
你們會吵架  會急得跺腳
And you will fight, and you will stomp around--

733
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,220
至少我會急得跺腳
at least that's what I do.

734
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,020
但是你們會熬過困境
But you will get through the hard times,

735
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,790
因為你們會有很多快樂的時光
because there will be so much joy.

736
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,730
這倒是真的
Which was true, for the record.

737
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,450
很多快樂的時光
So much joy.

738
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,150
謝謝
Thank you...

739
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,350
羅格里奧很好
Rogelio is fine.

740
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,970
呼氣
Now... Inhala...

741
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,620
吸氣
Exhala.

742
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,010
好了
‭Yeah.

743
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,550
大家都放輕松
Everyone just relax.

744
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,860
{\an8}婚禮已過六分鐘

745
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,550
新郎新娘隨時會到
They'll be here any minute.

746
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,250
其實我有一些笑話
You know, I actually didn't get to do,

747
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,530
在彩排晚宴上沒機會說
uh, some of my jokes from the rehearsal dinner.

748
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,980
有誰現在想聽聽嗎
Anyone want to hear them now?

749
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,400
現在不想  以后也不想
Not now, not ever.

750
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,730
天吶
Oh, my God.

751
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,430
她來了
She's here.

752
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,270
天吶  我沒準備好
OMG. I'm not ready!

753
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,400
不是新娘簡
Oh. Wrong Jane.

754
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,090
但是她真美
But damn, she looks good!

755
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,900
你怎么來了
What are you doing here?

756
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,500
拉斐爾打電話給我
Rafael called.

757
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,370
他干什么
He what?!

758
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,490
他和我說你對我還有感覺 
Yeah, he told me that you still had feelings for me,

759
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,420
他苦口婆心地和我說人生苦短
and he made this big speech about how life is too short,

760
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,550
我知道很老土
and I know it's corny,

761
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,450
但我媽剛過世
but my mom just died, and...

762
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,080
我最近一直在想你
I've been thinking about you so much lately.

763
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,640
說實話  我一直愛著你
And honestly, I never stopped loving you,

764
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,850
我只是...
and I just...

765
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,570
我也愛你
I love you, too.

766
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,190
你母親過世我感到很難過
And I'm so sorry about your mother.

767
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,120
謝謝
Thank you.

768
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,090
你母親的事我也很難過
I'm sorry about yours.

769
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,360
別擔心  她也走了
Oh, don't worry. She's gone, too.

770
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,640
對了  我來告訴大家她去了哪
Yes, and let me show you where she went.

771
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,530
{\an8}西伯利亞某地

772
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,040
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}彼得

773
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,430
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}媽媽來了

774
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,480
我能什么呢
What can I say but...

775
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,840
{\an8}三胞胎之一

776
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,570
只能說是從肥皂劇里抄來的
straight out of a telenovela.

777
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,260
我們回到這里
Which brings us back...

778
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,280
到了  我們到了
Here! We're here!

779
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,180
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}怎么樣

780
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,090
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}你準備好結婚了嗎

781
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,480
我完全準備好了
I couldn't be more ready.

782
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,370
大家都知道
As you well know,

783
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,000
因為我一直在告訴大家
because I've been telling you,

784
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,710
肥皂劇通常以婚禮收尾
telenovelas end with a wedding.

785
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,900
經歷了一段漫長之旅后
And after a long journey,

786
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,220
我們終于開始自己的旅程了
we are finally at ours.

787
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,380
謝謝
Thank you.

788
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,660
值得注意的是  在這美好的一刻
It should be noted, at this very moment,

789
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,520
簡的激動之情包括了
Jane's passions included...

790
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,880
她的家人
her family...

791
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,620
天吶
God...

792
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,390
烤芝士三明治
grilled cheese sandwiches...

793
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,910
寫作
writing...

794
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,200
拉斐爾·索拉諾
and... Rafael Solano.

795
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,510
謝謝大家今天賞光出席
Thank you all for being here today.

796
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,390
首先  我們精選了《愛是你我》的一段話
To begin, we have a selected reading from Love is You & Me.

797
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,640
愛是你  愛是我
"Love is me, and love is you.

798
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,430
所以我會隨著你一起笑
So when you smile, I smile, too."

799
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,900
有你在旁  天空湛藍
"When you're around, the skies are blue.

800
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,610
猶如幸福加倍
It's like being happy times two."

801
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,210
愛很歡樂
"Love is fun!

802
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,910
無拘無束  愛能讓人隨心而動
It's feeling free! Love lets you be who you want to be!"

803
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,870
你念這么大聲
Wow. You're using your big-boy voice!

804
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,430
我和曾祖木一起練習的
I practiced with Great Glamma.

805
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,940
她說我很適合做配音
She said I'd be great at voice-over work.

806
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,780
我聲明  我是
And for the record, I am.

807
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,640
不過我自己這么說可能不太好
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

808
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,110
接下來的話我要用西班牙語說
Now, I will be speaking Spanish,

809
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,120
如果你們中有人不懂西班牙語
so for those of you who are Spanish-impaired...

810
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,790
在手冊中有翻譯
...there are translations in the programs.

811
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,610
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}我們今天聚在這里

812
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:46,130

816
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,800
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}他唯一的缺點是

817
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,900
{\an8}{\pos(192,199.274)}不是天主教徒  所以我必須在這個露天教堂之中作見證

818
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}但是

819
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,640
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}我很高興我可以作見證

820
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,450
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}因為站在這里

821
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,450
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}看著你們結合

822
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,610
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}會是我

823
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,880
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}余生珍視的時刻

824
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,830
我聲明  這是真的
Which, for the record, was true.

825
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,300
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}伊莎貝爾·阿連德曾說過

826
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,160
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}"你是你人生故事的講述者"

{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}簡和拉斐爾

829
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,380
{\an8}{\pos(192,199.274)}因為你們一路走來  風雨波折  就像電視劇一樣

830
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,660
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}但不管怎樣

831
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,630
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}你們為彼此而戰

832
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:47,810
