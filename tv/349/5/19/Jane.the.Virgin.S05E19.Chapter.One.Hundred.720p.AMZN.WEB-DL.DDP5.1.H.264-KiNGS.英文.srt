18
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,540
Ah, friends. Where to start?

19
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,710
With the accidental insemination?

20
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,290
With the love story?

21
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,970
With the heartbreak?

22
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,430
J.R. broke up with me.

23
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,920
With the friendship...

24
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,150
I'll just ask one of my sisters for an egg.

25
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,860
I don't want to complicate our friendship.

26
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,550
With the marriages...

27
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,390
With the family...

28
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,900
With the career high...

29
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,860
The auction's over.

30
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,700
$500,000.

31
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,900
You did it, Jane.

32
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,520
With the three women...

33
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,570
At the end of the day, those three women.

34
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,650
Yes, friends, let's start there.

35
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,530
Since that's where our story began...

36
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,050
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was a much younger girl,

37
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,220
she had to face the unthinkable...

38
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,620
What do you mean the telenovela's gonna end?

39
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,420
Well, they just revealed the last big secret.

40
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,960
So the show's almost over.

41
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,050
Forever?

42
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,800
But Lina watches Days of our Lives with her family,

43
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,760
and they're on season 34.

49
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,120
Yes, friends,

50
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,530
our Jane never loved endings.

51
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,160
And yet, here she was, facing a doozy.

53
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,200
I just don't think I can say goodbye.

54
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,630
To the couch?

55
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,800
It was our first big purchase together.

56
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,640
How can we just get rid of it?

57
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,390
Just think how happy it'll make someone who didn't

58
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,500
just sign a massive book deal.

59
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,900
Come on. You said you wanted to splurge on something.

60
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,940
And I will, just not a $5,000 couch

61
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,720
Mateo's gonna jump all over.

62
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,940
Hey, guys...

63
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,610
Can you please tell her that

64
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,740
she has to buy something with her book advance?

65
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,030
Tell him I'm going to after I finish the first round

66
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,410
of notes from my editor.

67
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,910
I just want to make sure that they like it,

68
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,400
- since they're paying... - Say it.

69
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,030
...half a million dollars!

70
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,740
Who-- what, are you guys over it already?

71
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,050
Actually, we wanted to have lunch today

72
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,250
to tell you something.

73
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,540
Okay.

74
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,710
We're... moving to New York.

75
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,810
What?

76
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,810
So, yeah.

77
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,980
That's the doozy I was talking about.

78
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,680
This Is Mars will be filming there.

79
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,150
So your mother graciously offered

80
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,780
to transfer nursing schools.

81
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,820
We didn't want to say anything unless we could convince

82
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,480
Darci and Esteban to move.

83
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,480
Your father didn't want to miss out on baby's childhood.

84
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,820
Not that I want to miss out on your adulthood.

85
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,280
But, uh, New York is just a short flight away.

86
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,780
I get it.

87
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,820
Of course.

88
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,120
So when are you moving?

89
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,660
Three days after the wedding.

90
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,540
Wow. Okay.

91
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,470
Well, it's a good thing

92
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,590
that we're not going on a honeymoon right away.

93
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,630
I'm gonna miss you.

94
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,430
Me, too. So much.

95
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,610
Oh! I can't believe

96
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,770
we won't be in the same city.

97
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,440
Oh, no, but... this is good.

98
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,230
This is exciting.

99
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,610
If you say so.

103
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,540
Okay, uh, so, we still have a month.

104
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,550
What do we do?

105
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,090
Just live our lives.

106
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,600
- You have to finish editing your book. - Exactly.

107
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,880
And I'll take the lead on wedding planning.

108
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,710
You okay?

109
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,670
I just feel like I'm already losing time.

110
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,390
It does go quickly, friends,

111
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,640
as you well know.

113
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,600
Ah... so that's it.

114
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,020
My book is officially finished.

115
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,440
- My editor loves the new ending. ‭- And you?

116
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,830
I'm, like, 98 and a half percent there.

117
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,040
But I have accepted

118
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,580
I'll never get to a hundred.

119
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,170
Too much anxiety. The point is,

120
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,750
I've typed "the end," and I'm on track for a summer release.

121
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,780
Badass. ‭

122
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,090
Does that mean we can upgrade to a plated dinner?

123
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,500
For $26 a head? No way.

124
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,390
My abuela's church friends can make their way to the buffet.

125
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,790
They've done it before. But...

126
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm ready to talk all things wedding.

127
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,310
All right. Let's do this.

128
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,100
God, I love seeing you with that checklist.

129
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,090
What a turn-on.

130
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,190
Why, thank you. Okay.

131
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,320
The caterer has our deposit.

132
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,940
The cake is confirmed and so is the DJ.

133
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,570
I e-mailed all the vendors and the guests

134
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,320
to remind them that the marathon is this weekend,

135
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,660
so traffic will be crazy.

136
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,950
Look at you talking all dirty.

137
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,370
Lina has confirmed

138
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,610
that the wedding dress is in transit.

139
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,440
And, ah. Now onto some open questions.

140
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,420
- Hit me with them open questions. - Are we...

141
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,630
sleeping together or apart the night before the wedding?

142
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,570
- Together. Definitely. ‭- Agreed.

143
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,780
And I finished my vows.

144
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,210
Mm. ‭First time I've ever finished

145
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,490
a writing assignment on time.

146
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,120
First time I haven't.

147
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,620
B-Because of my book.

148
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,580
Don't worry, I got this.

149
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,920
I'm not worried.

150
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,460
But there is one more thing we have to do.

151
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,250
What?

152
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,970
Practice our dance.

153
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,680
Way too sweet.

154
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,110
I don't want hearts on the place cards.

155
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,190
We're not in third grade.

156
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,780
Are you sure you don't want to invite

157
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,360
any more people to the rehearsal dinner?

158
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,870
Hmm? Jane won't have to spend a dime of that book money-- it's my treat.

159
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,330
Nah. We want to keep it small.

160
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,250
But if you want to bring a plus-one...

161
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,710
Please. That's just not what I'm about right now.

162
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,700
I am happily married to the Marbella.

165
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,210
Now let's talk schedule.

166
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,140
Cocktail hour will be from 5:00 to 6:00, followed by dinner.

167
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,350
During dinner, we'll do the toasts.

168
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,840
And yes,

169
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,890
- I will be making one. - ‭Oh, yeah?

170
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,930
Yes. And it's going to be really funny.

171
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,730
But Petra's not funny.

172
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,320
I know. But she was so excited, so just laugh

173
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,860
- whenever she pauses. - I will.

174
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,350
Unless she publicly fires someone.

175
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,490
How was the dress fitting?

176
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,240
Amazing. Lina crushed it.

177
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,270
I'm so happy.

178
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,870
Oh, I can't wait to see you in it.

179
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,080
Oh. Love you. See you at home.

180
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,030
Jane?

181
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,580
Hey. I got your e-mail, and yes, we would love

182
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,500
for you to marry our spirits-- though we are thinking

183
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,090
it's more of an after-ceremony private thing.

184
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,050
Great. Um, but I was

185
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,370
actually hoping to talk to you about something else.

186
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,220
Uh-oh. That's never good.

187
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,620
Of course. Sure. What is it?

188
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,000
I found Rafael's birth parents.

189
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,750
Yes, friends, looks like that last secret

190
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,710
will finally be revealed.

191
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,320
As you can imagine-- or I can--

192
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,110
there are so many ways a story can end.

193
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,670
You found Rafael's parents?

194
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,090
Endings can be dramatic.

195
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,170
Are they crime lords?

196
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,970
Or shocking.

197
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,410
Rose isn't his mother, is she?

198
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,120
Or seemingly mundane.

199
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,830
His parents were just...

200
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,500
regular people.

201
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,670
Were?

202
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,270
- They're dead. - Which, of course,

203
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,360
is a different kind of ending altogether.

204
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,260
Oh, no.

205
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
Here's everything I could find out about them.

206
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,890
I thought...

207
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,600
you should be the one to tell Rafael.

210
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,590
If I'm cold, I'll go shopping.

211
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,490
I hear there are stores in New York.

216
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,090
Hey. Where's Mateo? I have to get home to talk to Rafael.

217
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,090
Upstairs. He said he's working on some big surprise for me.

218
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,800
Wha...?

219
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,400
Mateo, what did you do?

220
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,860
I unpacked you, so now you don't have to move.

221
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,770
Looks like Jane's son doesn't like goodbyes, either.

222
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,040
Mateo, sweetie, Abuela still has to move.

223
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,860
Why?

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,540
You know why. Because of Papa's show.

225
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,960
That's why Papa has to move,

226
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,410
but Abuela could stay here with us.

227
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,130
- No, I can't, sweetie. - Yes, you can.

228
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,590
You just don't want to.

229
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,550
- That's not true. - ‭You could if you wanted to.

230
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,760
It'll be okay, Mateo.

231
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,410
It's just like we talked about.

232
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,540
Okay? We'll FaceTime every night.

233
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,810
It's not the same.

234
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,460
It's just not.

235
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,800
Yeah, I know how you feel, buddy.

236
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,970
Hey.

237
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,570
- What took you guys so long? - We had a little issue,

238
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,490
but we're doing better. Right, Mr. Sweetface?

239
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,480
Can I sleep in bed with you guys tonight?

240
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,660
No fair! If he gets to, then we do, too.

241
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,660
- Yeah. And no tooting, Mateo. - ‭It's not tooting

242
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,000
if I do it in my sleep.

243
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,210
Uh, yes, it is. It's still tooting.

244
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,900
Official ruling is...

245
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,630
- it's tooting! - ‭Yeah!

246
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,700
Hey, and try not to do it in your sleep tonight, huh?

247
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,910
So, what do you say?

248
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,120
Family sleepover?

249
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,790
Okay, let's do it.

250
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,670
Thank you.

251
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,020
You are an excellent agent,  Barry.

252
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,760
Okay.

253
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,270
The network just dropped the This Is Mars pilot online

254
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,010
to generate some buzz before it officially starts airing in the fall.

255
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,030
I just can't believe it's finally being released to American audiences.

256
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,410
People are watching it right now.

257
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,640
Do you think there's buzz yet?

258
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,190
Probably not.

259
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,440
Xo...

260
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,450
it's happening.

261
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,410
Mars is already trending.

262
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,820
America loves me!

263
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,740
Oh. Apparently, America loves NASA.

264
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,120
They just landed another rover on Mars.

265
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,210
Oh, I'll just help you repack to take my mind off it.

266
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,050
But, I mean, it's exciting, no?

267
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,710
Lots of big changes ahead.

268
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,760
Luisa found my parents?

269
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,400
Yes. And I don't know how to tell you this

270
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,850
except to just tell you.

271
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,930
They died in a car accident.

272
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,730
‭I am so sorry.

273
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,370
They lived in Italy.

274
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,120
They owned a bakery.

275
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,990
- It's all in there. - ‭A bakery.

276
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,490
How normal.

277
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,840
I-I guess I was expecting something,

278
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,450
Straight out of a telenovela?

279
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,160
bigger.

280
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,580
Crazier.

281
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,080
Like I said.

282
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,170
I know it's a terrible time to find out,

283
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,380
right before the wedding.

284
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,500
No.

285
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,340
Actually, it's the perfect time.

286
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,180
I think a few months ago I would have been devastated.

287
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,970
But all I can think about right now is...

288
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,310
how much I do have.

289
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,230
I mean, I am literally surrounded by family.

290
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,110
So how can I feel anything but gratitude?

291
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,150
It's like Chekhov's gun.

292
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,700
Had to go off!

293
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,740
I can't wait to marry you.

294
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,490
Which brings us to...

295
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,180
Jane, walk faster.

296
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,600
Girls, get back here.

297
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,350
Mateo, why are your pants off?

298
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,880
Luckily, just the rehearsal.

300
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,670
Because this is the third run-through, Abuela.

301
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,840
Never fear,

303
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,550
I am here.

304
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,190
Hello, Mother.

305
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,640
Come here, my beautiful boy.

306
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,350
I have missed you so much.

307
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,910
I'm gonna do a reading at the wedding.

308
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,080
Then you have to practice projection,

309
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,900
so they can hear you from the cheap seats.

310
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,610
Hello, darling.

312
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,240
So, have you written your vows yet?

313
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,330
Tonight.

314
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,080
Oh, my God.

315
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,640
The publisher is printing

316
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,060
advanced galleys of my book this week.

317
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,880
They're sending them to authors to review.

318
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,980
What?! That's amazing.

319
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,510
But wait, that's not even the best part.

320
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,930
One of the authors is Isabel Allende.

322
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,150
‭Isabel Allende might write

323
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,180
a blurb for the back of my book!

324
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,100
Lina, are you okay?

325
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,060
Yes. I'm sorry. I'm fine.

326
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,060
Go on.

327
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,690
Isabel Something. Yay!

328
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,540
Okay, I was gonna wait until after the wedding

329
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,820
to tell you, but...

330
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,490
- I'm pregnant. - Oh, my God. Congratulations.

331
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,580
Which sister gave you an egg?

332
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,420
The pretty one, clearly.

333
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,600
- Alexis? - Jackie.

334
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,420
That's what I meant. I just, I mix them up all the time.

335
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,980
I am so happy for you,

336
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,590
and your very lucky baby.

337
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,270
Okay, enough.

338
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,090
I'm supposed to be gushing about you.

339
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,930
Which, for the record, she did.

340
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,100
People think I grew up with four sisters...

341
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,770
but the truth is, I grew up with five.

342
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,690
And I only liked one of them.

343
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,330
Jane, you are...

344
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,860
everything to me.

345
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,240
The person I look up to the most in this world,

346
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,490
the person I want to be when I grow up.

347
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,430
And the one thing I know...

348
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,540
is that, becoming Jane's father

349
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,500
late in life,

350
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,510
has been...

351
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,260
well, the greatest joy of my life.

352
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,110
It's true. And,

353
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,140
tomorrow, I'm so thrilled to be gaining a son.

354
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,270
So, Rafael,

355
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,440
I would be honored if you call me Dad.

356
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,070
Thank you.

357
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,370
Thank you...?

358
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,000
Very much.

359
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,210
Well, you'll sort that out.

360
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,920
So,

361
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,170
anyway, there's been a lot of tears shed here tonight,

362
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,460
so I think it's time for some laughs.

363
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,980
I always knew Jane was super into weddings,

364
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,140
because she was always marrying the ketchups at work.

365
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,390
And Rafael, well, he's always been...

366
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,190
Well, his shirts are so tight,

367
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,100
 and his pants...

368
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,960
It's okay, Petra.

369
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,580
You don't have to be funny.

370
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,140
No,

371
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,850
I wrote these jokes so I wouldn't get emotional like this.

372
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,790
Eh, I don't think it's working.

373
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,450
I just love you two so much.

374
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,620
Your love is something I aspire to.

375
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,100
And I wish you all the happiness in the world,

376
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,410
which is a really weird feeling,

377
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,860
because I don't usually wish happiness on other people.

378
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,400
- I love you. ‭- I love you.

379
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,450
Thank you so much, everyone.

380
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,630
We are just...

381
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,850
I also want to make a toast.

382
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,620
Jane, a long time ago,

383
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,250
I was going through a rough time,

384
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,930
and I accidentally inseminated you.

385
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,940
So I just want to take this moment to say...

386
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,560
you're welcome.

387
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,080
Suffice it to say, on that night, there was love.

388
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,750
So much in fact, that suddenly Jane realized something.

389
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,810
You have that look.

390
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,610
- You want to go write? - Quickly. Is that okay?

391
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,240
- Of course. Go. - ‭Okay.

392
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,850
So...

393
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,410
you seemed a little choked up about love.

394
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,220
Oh, please. Villanueva events are made for people to cry.

395
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,700
It's just how they're constructed.

396
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,780
It's fine. I'm fine.

397
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,450
Where did Jane run off to?

398
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,500
There she is.

399
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,580
Somebody was inspired by those speeches.

400
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,700
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone

401
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,610
that my wife, the writer, plagiarized her vows.

402
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,390
Oh, I wasn't writing my vows.

403
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,330
I, uh... I-I just suddenly got an idea for the end of my book

404
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,380
that would get me close to 100%,

405
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,780
and I e-mailed my editor to see if she could get the file

406
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,100
into the printing press in time to get it to Isabel Allende.

407
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,390
Got it.

408
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,000
I was gonna write my vows later tonight.

409
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,510
Well, you know what they say.

410
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,670
It's always best when you just slip 'em in

411
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,420
right under the deadline.

412
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,260
We should get back inside. Dessert's coming.

413
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,980
I definitely ate too much cake.

414
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,670
Yeah. Me, too.

415
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,530
You're upset, and I get it.

416
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,050
I put Rafael on the spot, but it came from a good place.

417
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,580
Rogelio, it's not that.

418
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,270
I need to tell you something.

419
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,380
I don't think I can move to New York.

420
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,980
Wh-What do you mean, you can't move to New York?

421
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,030
I just don't want to leave my whole family.

422
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,150
And I've been trying to push that feeling aside

423
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,230
and support you, but... I really don't think

424
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,750
it's the right move for me.

425
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,890
I mean, I just started

426
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,170
getting into the groove with my nursing program.

427
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,180
My life finally feels like it's on track.

428
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,990
So? So wha-what are you saying?

429
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,130
Because I have to go.

430
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,670
I signed a contract.

431
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
Well, I was thinking,

432
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,490
maybe we should commute.

433
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,170
Just for this year.

434
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,110
I'll live here during the week,

435
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,740
and we'll travel to each other on weekends.

436
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,420
Think about it. Your hours are long anyway.

437
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,240
It's not like I'd even see you during the week when you're shooting.

438
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,470
I mean, I want you to be happy.

439
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,020
W-Will commuting make you happy?

440
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,390
I think it will.

441
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,470
Okay. Then...

442
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,250
let's do it.

443
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,180
Thank you, Rogelio.

444
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,380
So I finished my vows.

445
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,370
And I'm so sorry about earlier.

446
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,120
No. No. I... I overreacted.

447
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,410
Your book is so important.

448
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,290
You're important.

449
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,060
I just wasn't worried about writing my vows

450
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,500
because I knew exactly what I wanted to say.

451
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,220
Because I think about

452
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,630
how lucky I am to be with you every day.

453
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,080
And I'm so excited about our wedding,

454
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,200
but I'm most excited about our future together.

455
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,230
Because it's not like the telenovelas I grew up watching.

456
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,550
The wedding isn't the end.

457
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,650
Our story is just beginning.

458
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,350
Stop rubbing it in!

459
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,410
Thanks.

460
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,540
I think I'm just feeling a little vulnerable.

461
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,520
You know, last night you told me my birth parents are dead,

462
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,100
and it didn't even faze me.

463
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,660
Because of how much I love you.

464
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,250
And that's a lot to put on someone.

465
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,550
Not too much.

466
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,310
And just because I can't wait for the future,

467
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,510
I don't want to skip this moment.

468
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,900
So let's not wait.

469
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,660
Let's take our honeymoon right away.

470
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,930
OMG. Is it finally time for that big splurge?

471
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,010
And because we never go on vacations,

472
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,230
I have a million points for flights and hotels,

473
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,590
so we'll barely pay for any of it.

474
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,260
Nope, guess not.

475
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,550
I'm in.

476
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,250
Oh, no.

477
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,970
You have to go.

478
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,450
Turn around and go back home.

479
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,000
Hello to you, too, Ma.

480
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,940
Abuela called.

481
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,240
Thank you, Abuela.

482
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,300
What do you mean you're not moving?

483
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,210
I thought about it, and it's just not what I want.

484
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,240
I mean, I shouldn't have to upend my life.

485
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,000
This isn't the 1950s.

486
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,990
You were the one who looked into nursing schools.

487
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,090
You said you wanted to go.

488
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,420
And I changed my mind. I want to stay here.

489
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,830
Because Mateo freaked out?

490
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,100
He's a kid, Ma.

491
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,470
He's also right.

492
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,810
I don't have to go if I don't want to, and I don't.

493
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,790
I want to be here for things like your book coming out,

494
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,180
and-and dinners and birthdays, and-and...

496
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,130
I'm so stupid.

497
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,980
I'm 46 years old, and I've lived near you

498
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,750
for my whole life, Mom.

499
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,030
And for your whole life.

500
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,860
You'll recall our Jane wasn't fond of endings.

501
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,120
And now what? That's just over?

502
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,490
A trait she got from her mother.

512
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,330
You're coming with me to New York?!

513
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,960
Oh, thank God. I'm so glad.

514
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,110
I love you so much.

515
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,780
And I love you, too!

516
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,680
Oh. Uh, thanks.

517
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,640
What are you doing here?

518
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,060
Oh. Oh, I just... I just came...

519
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,770
to give you this... for the wedding tomorrow.

520
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,230
Is that a... necklace?

521
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,190
Uh, I... I wasn't planning on wearing any jewelry.

522
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,520
It's a lazo de novia.

523
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,800
It's a Mexican wedding lasso.

524
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,550
Loved ones place it around the bride and groom

525
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,370
during the ceremony as a symbol of unity.

526
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,680
My-my father gave it to me,

527
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,350
and now, I will like to pass it on to you.

528
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,760
Thank you. ‭Yeah.

529
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,100
Also, I wanted to apologize.

530
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,370
I put you on the spot with the whole "Dad" Thing.

531
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:00,720
I appreciate that.

532
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,250
But we're in private now, so...

533
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,430
if you want to try it out, that's...

534
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,340
I'm sorry.

535
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,530
It just doesn't really roll off the tongue,

536
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,770
but you know I love you.

538
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,150
Is everything okay?

539
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,270
I don't know. I'm... I'm blowing up.

541
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,550
Something's happening online, but...

542
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,960
And, friends, that's when he realized...

543
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,530
Oh, my God.

544
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,540
My social media is exploding.

545
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,130
I'm doubling--

546
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,820
no, tripling in followers.

547
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,550
Which means people must be watching the This Is Mars pilot.

548
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,200
This could be it, Rafael.

549
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,300
I-I could be breaking through in America.

550
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,110
Well, I hope so.

551
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,010
Oh, yeah, me, too.

552
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,870
But-but-but we should keep this between us right now

553
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,270
because I-I don't want to steal Jane's thunder, you know.

554
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,780
She's getting married tomorrow.

555
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
As am I.

556
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,580
I can't believe it.

557
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,530
Our last night together.

558
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,950
I know.

563
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,810
Ah, man.

564
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,230
Who didn't turn out the lights?

565
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,550
Hey, I have a big day tomorrow, remember?

566
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,580
I'm moving, it's so hard.

567
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,090
Okay, okay.

569
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,610
Love you, Abuela.

573
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,690
I am overwhelmed by the love and support in this room.

574
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,480
Once upon a time, friends,

575
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,400
there was this very moment...

576
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,430
But alas, the moment is already gone.

577
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,200
Everything okay?

578
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,180
My editor.

579
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,230
It's not important.

580
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,260
Today is about...

581
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,000
Him.

582
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,490
Hey, there, my groom.

583
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,780
Hey, bride-to-be, happy wedding day.

584
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,880
So, according to the schedule,

585
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,420
hair and makeup should be arriving...

586
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,820
Ah, they just got here.

587
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,940
Oh, great.

588
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,660
And did your editor get your changes in time?

589
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,070
No, but you know what? It's fine.

590
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,090
They'll make the switch when they print the real book.

591
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,640
But what about Isabel Allende? She won't read your ending.

592
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,560
There must be something you can do.

593
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,880
Nothing short of hand-delivering a flash drive

594
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,120
to the printing press.

595
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,000
Which I would never do on our wedding day.

596
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,840
Don't worry.

597
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,190
I have no interest in running off on some crazy adventure today.

598
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,180
I'll see you at the altar.

599
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,040
I love you.

600
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,200
I love you, too.

601
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,530
Well, she might not be interested,

602
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,690
but it looks like he is.

603
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,270
Hello? Hello?

605
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,080
Uh, can I help you?

606
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,480
Stop the presses.

607
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,080
Isn't that what they say?

608
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,890
In the 1920s.

609
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,710
I'm sorry.

610
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,890
I-I have a-a huge favor to ask you.

612
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,030
Oh, hey, thanks again, man.

613
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,080
- You're a lifesaver. - ‭No problem.

614
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,780
- Hey, good luck, buddy. - ‭Thank you!

615
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,380
Hello?

616
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:33,970
Hello!

617
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,420
Ah, screw it.

618
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,300
Guess Jane's splurging on that gate.

619
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,340
Hi, almost-husband.

620
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,070
Don't worry, I'm right on schedule.

621
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,130
Yeah, our schedule might have to change a little.

622
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,680
I got arrested and I need to be bailed out.

623
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,730
Speaking of family stories,

624
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,490
this one would be repeated often.

625
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,120
And then he drove his car through the gate

626
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,230
and got arrested so I have to go get him.

627
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,210
But Mom took the car to pick up Jorge.

628
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,260
I'll call a car.

629
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,550
Jane, wait, let me go.

630
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,730
- It's your wedding. - That's why it has to be me.

631
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,210
What Raf did was so romantic,

632
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,080
I have to be the one to go get him!

633
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,790
Sure.

634
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,120
What could go wrong?

636
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,440
Wha...?

637
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,150
Philipe, hey. What's going on?

638
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,270
It's been saying you're ten minutes away

639
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,390
for about 20 minutes now.

640
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,430
I can't get to you because of the marathon.

641
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,430
Can you meet me on Plymouth Street?

642
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,080
It's just a few blocks away.

643
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,680
Uh, y-yeah, sure.

644
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,880
I-I'll be right there.

645
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,540
Yeah. Oh. Yikes!

646
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,480
Coming through!

647
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,860
Nice hair.

648
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,620
Thank you.

649
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,060
It's my wedding day!

650
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,520
Oh, sorry.

651
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,380
Got it! You got it!

652
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,560
- Keep going. - ‭Thank you.

654
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,990
Ah, Philipe.

655
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,800
And suddenly, in a moment

656
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,980
of sheer coincidence or part of the grand plan all along...

657
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,670
Hop on, Jane.

659
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,740
I am so sorry, but is there any way

660
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,610
that we could make a quick detour

661
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,940
and stop at the police station?

662
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,200
After all this time,

663
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,010
doesn't she know how buses work?

664
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,300
You see, I'm getting married today and, well,

665
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,890
my fiancé and I have been through so much.

666
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,960
An accidental insemination, a kidnapping, an evil twin,

667
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,160
a husband returning from the dead

668
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,820
and this is our last obstacle.

669
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,990
So I'm begging you-- can you please help me?

670
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,700
No.

671
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,650
I will pay you $5,000 to rent out the whole bus.

672
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,950
Guess Jane's finally decided what to splurge on.

673
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,180
What about us?

674
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,370
How much you gonna pay us?

675
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,960
How's, uh, $50 each?

676
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,180
A hundred?

677
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,210
I got things to do, lady.

678
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,860
I got to go to the bank, the dry cleaners,

679
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,230
- the nail salon... ‭- $200.

680
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,210
Final offer. Please.

681
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,830
I'm getting married in 56 minutes.

682
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,380
That'll work.

683
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,360
Ah, great!

684
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,960
To the police station.

685
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,470
All right, we're good.

686
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,060
Oh. Hey, Mom.

687
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,470
Where are you? We're all here.

688
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,880
I'm coming and I got the groom.

689
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,610
I'll text you the address of where we'll pick you all up.

690
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,440
W-What are you driving? Is it big enough?

691
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,810
Oh, yeah, I-it's big enough.

692
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,760
Make way! Make way!

693
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,440
Wedding party of Jane Gloriana Villanueva coming through!

694
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,050
It's okay!

695
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,080
Save the dress!

696
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,110
And, friends, that's when...

697
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,520
Aren't you Rogelio De La Vega

698
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,620
from that show that just dropped--

699
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,770
the dude from This Is Mars.

700
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,040
Oh, yeah. You're hilarious, man.

701
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,840
Yes, yes, it is I.

702
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,170
Rogelio De La Vega. American star.

703
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,280
Which he will be very shortly, friends.

704
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,090
In fact, here's a little taste of what's to come.

705
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,480
Cross over!

706
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:43,780
Yes.

707
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,250
Come on! Hurry!

708
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,800
Oh! Excuse me.

709
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,800
Jane, we're here. Where are you?

710
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,190
Mom!

711
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,440
Let's go!

712
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,020
Ma'am-- you, stand right here.

713
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,070
Sir, can you stand right here, please?

714
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,550
But don't look, either. Turn around.

717
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,070
Oh, red light. Hand me the eyeliner.

718
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,360
How's it going back there?

719
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,280
No! Don't look!

720
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,320
Are you crazy?

721
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,000
You need help?

722
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,120
Oh, yeah, thank you.

724
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,930
Okay, we are now officially late.

725
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,250
Don't sweat it; they won't start without you.

726
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,870
I was a nervous groom once, too, you know.

727
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,530
Actually, three times, but who's counting?

728
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,830
But you are going to get there,

729
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,230
and you are going to be so happy together.

730
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,640
Not always, of course.

731
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,990
At times, things will be difficult.

732
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,080
And you will fight, and you will stomp around--

733
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,220
at least that's what I do.

734
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,020
But you will get through the hard times,

735
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,790
because there will be so much joy.

736
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,730
Which was true, for the record.

737
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,450
So much joy.

738
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,150
Thank you...

739
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,350
Rogelio is fine.

740
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,970
Now... Inhala...

741
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,620
Exhala.

742
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,010
‭Yeah.

743
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,550
Everyone just relax.

745
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,550
They'll be here any minute.

746
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,250
You know, I actually didn't get to do,

747
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,530
uh, some of my jokes from the rehearsal dinner.

748
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,980
Anyone want to hear them now?

749
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,400
Not now, not ever.

750
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,730
Oh, my God.

751
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,430
She's here.

752
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,270
OMG. I'm not ready!

753
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,400
Oh. Wrong Jane.

754
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,090
But damn, she looks good!

755
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,900
What are you doing here?

756
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,500
Rafael called.

757
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,370
He what?!

758
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,490
Yeah, he told me that you still had feelings for me,

759
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,420
and he made this big speech about how life is too short,

760
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,550
and I know it's corny,

761
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,450
but my mom just died, and...

762
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,080
I've been thinking about you so much lately.

763
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,640
And honestly, I never stopped loving you,

764
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,850
and I just...

765
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,570
I love you, too.

766
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,190
And I'm so sorry about your mother.

767
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Thank you.

768
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,090
I'm sorry about yours.

769
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,360
Oh, don't worry. She's gone, too.

770
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,640
Yes, and let me show you where she went.

774
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,480
What can I say but...

776
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,570
straight out of a telenovela.

777
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,260
Which brings us back...

778
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,280
Here! We're here!

781
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,480
I couldn't be more ready.

782
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,370
As you well know,

783
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,000
because I've been telling you,

784
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,710
telenovelas end with a wedding.

785
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,900
And after a long journey,

786
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,220
we are finally at ours.

787
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,380
Thank you.

788
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,660
It should be noted, at this very moment,

789
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,520
Jane's passions included...

790
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,880
her family...

791
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,620
God...

792
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,390
grilled cheese sandwiches...

793
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,910
writing...

794
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,200
and... Rafael Solano.

795
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,510
Thank you all for being here today.

796
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,390
To begin, we have a selected reading from Love is You & Me.

797
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,640
"Love is me, and love is you.

798
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,430
So when you smile, I smile, too."

799
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,900
"When you're around, the skies are blue.

800
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,610
It's like being happy times two."

801
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,210
"Love is fun!

802
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,910
It's feeling free! Love lets you be who you want to be!"

803
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,870
Wow. You're using your big-boy voice!

804
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,430
I practiced with Great Glamma.

805
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,940
She said I'd be great at voice-over work.

806
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,780
And for the record, I am.

807
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,640
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

808
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,110
Now, I will be speaking Spanish,

809
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,120
so for those of you who are Spanish-impaired...

810
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,790
...there are translations in the programs.

824
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,830
Which, for the record, was true.

836
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,340
We place this around you

837
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,380
as a symbol of unity and commitment.

838
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,740
Now the everlasting

839
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,590
bond between you is sealed.

840
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,020
Thank you...

841
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,540
Dad.

842
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,230
Mom?

843
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,500
No, thank you.

845
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,550
Jane...

846
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,190
you made...

847
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,810
Jane...

848
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,980
you made...

849
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,250
Maybe you should go first.

850
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,670
Rafael, the first time we met,

851
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,470
you told me to be brave,

852
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,870
and...

853
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,750
Okay.

854
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,250
Rafael...

855
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:17,910
Maybe we should just...

856
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,110
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Sorry. We're just gonna read...

857
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,670
- them for ourselves. ‭- Yeah.

858
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,670
Which, friends,

859
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,660
they did.

861
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,380
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, Abuela.

866
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,980
Rafael, receive this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity.

867
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,510
Sorry.

868
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,960
- Sorry. - ‭Jane!

869
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,080
Jane,

870
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:18,150
receive this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity.

871
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,940
Yeah. Yeah.

876
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,320
Bravo!

877
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,180
Thank you, ladies.

878
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,110
Groom! Groom! Dad,

879
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,030
- get in here! ‭- Come on. ‭Come on, baby.

880
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,550
- Lovely. - Oh, yes, come on, Mateo.

881
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,490
Yes! Oh, yes, Petra, get in here!

882
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,440
- Come, come, come. Yes! Luisa! - Luisa!

883
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,000
Yes. ‭Hi, Baby.

884
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,840
H-Hold, hold. Hold on. Hold on. Here.

885
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,650
Yes... ‭

886
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,730
- Darci... - Oh, my God!

887
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,450
Should we go back inside?

888
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,850
Let's just sit here for another minute.

889
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,230
So, I never asked you.

890
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,040
Hmm?

891
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,730
What happens at the end of your book?

892
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,270
They make it into a telenovela.

893
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,900
Well, who'd want to watch that?
