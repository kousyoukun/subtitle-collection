1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,301
<i>Ah, friends. Where to start?</i>

2
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:06,617
<i>With the accidental
insemination?</i>

3
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:08,264
<i>With the love story?</i>

4
00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:09,917
<i>With the heartbreak?</i>

5
00:00:09,997 --> 00:00:11,297
<i>J.R. broke up with me.</i>

6
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:12,917
<i>With the friendship...</i>

7
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:14,967
I'll just ask one
of my sisters for an egg.

8
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:16,627
I don't want to complicate
our friendship.

9
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:18,723
<i>With the marriages...</i>

10
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:21,301
<i>With the family...</i>

11
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:23,687
<i>With the career high...</i>

12
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:24,767
The auction's over.

13
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:26,458
$500,000.

14
00:00:26,657 --> 00:00:27,860
You did it, Jane.

15
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:29,615
<i>With the three women...</i>

16
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:32,487
<i>At the end of the day,
those three women.</i>

17
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,479
<i>Yes, friends, let's start there.</i>

18
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:38,376
<i>Since that's where
our story began...</i>

19
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:43,945
<i>When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was a much younger girl,</i>

20
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,970
<i>she had to face
the unthinkable...</i>

21
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,319
What do you mean
the telenovela's gonna end?

22
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:51,249
Well, they just revealed
the last big secret.

23
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:52,846
So the show's almost over.

24
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,343
Forever?

25
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:56,474
But Lina watches
<i>Days of our Lives</i>

26
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:59,549
with her family,
and they're on season 34.

27
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:03,386
_

28
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,620
_

29
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:08,186
_

30
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:11,673
_

31
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,011
_

32
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,279
<i>Yes, friends,</i>

33
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:19,472
<i>our Jane never loved endings.</i>

34
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:23,708
<i>And yet, here she was,
facing a doozy.</i>

35
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,321
I just don't think
I can say goodbye.

36
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:27,608
To the couch?

37
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,809
It was our first
big purchase together.

38
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,634
How can we just get rid of it?

39
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:33,484
Just think how happy it'll make
someone who didn't

40
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,824
just sign a massive book deal.

41
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:38,814
Come on. You said you wanted
to splurge on something.

42
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:40,949
And I will, just not
a $5,000 couch

43
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:42,324
Mateo's gonna jump all over.

44
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:44,734
Hey, guys...

45
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:45,820
Can you please

46
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:47,670
tell her that she has
to buy something

47
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:48,925
with her book advance?

48
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,247
Tell him I'm going to after
I finish the first round

49
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:52,296
of notes from my editor.

50
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:54,402
I just want to make sure
that they like it, since

51
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:56,357
- they're paying...
- Say it.

52
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:58,769
Half a million dollars!

53
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:04,019
Who... what, are you
guys over it already?

54
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:07,895
Actually, we wanted
to have lunch today

55
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,097
to tell you something.

56
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:11,627
Okay.

57
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:17,422
We're... moving
to New York.

58
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:19,698
What?

59
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,745
<i>So, yeah.</i>

60
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,888
<i>That's the doozy
I was talking about.</i>

61
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:24,543
<i>This Is Mars</i>
will be filming there.

62
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,372
So your mother
graciously offered

63
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,802
to transfer nursing schools.

64
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:30,908
We didn't want to say anything
unless we could convince

65
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,613
Darci and Esteban to move.

66
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:35,374
Your father didn't want to
miss out on Baby's childhood.

67
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:37,566
Not that I want to miss out
on your adulthood.

68
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:41,069
But, uh, New York
is just a short flight away.

69
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:42,632
I get it.

70
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,977
Of course.

71
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:48,347
So when are you moving?

72
00:02:49,187 --> 00:02:50,693
Three days after the wedding.

73
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,676
Wow. Okay.

74
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:54,764
Well, it's a good thing

75
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,827
that we're not going on
a honeymoon right away.

76
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,589
I'm gonna miss you.

77
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:04,863
Me, too. So much.

78
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:08,730
Oh! I can't believe

79
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,735
we won't be in the same city.

80
00:03:10,945 --> 00:03:12,325
Oh...

81
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:16,376
Oh, no, but...
this is good.

82
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:17,889
This is exciting.

83
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:19,934
<i>If you say so.</i>

84
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:24,474

Sync and correction by LittleDuck
www.addic7ed.com

86
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:31,298
Okay, uh, so, we
still have a month.

87
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:32,487
What do we do?

88
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,838
Just live our lives.
You have to finish

89
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:36,556
- editing your book.
- Exactly.

90
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:39,254
And I'll take the lead
on wedding planning.

91
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:41,017
You okay?

92
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,639
I just feel like I'm
already losing time.

93
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:46,287
<i>It does go quickly, friends,</i>

94
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:47,905
<i>as you well know.</i>

95
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:53,279
_

96
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:55,612
Ah... so that's it.

97
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,920
My book is officially finished.

98
00:03:58,142 --> 00:04:00,351
- My editor loves the new ending.
- And you?

99
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:02,861
I'm, like, 98 and a half
percent there.

100
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:04,396
But I have accepted

101
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,589
I'll never get to a hundred.

102
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:07,084
Too much anxiety.
The point is,

103
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,779
I've typed "the end," and I'm
on track for a summer release.

104
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,399
Badass.

105
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:14,284
Does that mean we can
upgrade to a plated dinner?

106
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:16,242
For $26 a head? No way.

107
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:18,433
My<i> abuela's</i> church friends can
make their way to the buffet.

108
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,658
They've done it before.
But...

109
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:21,451
I'm ready to talk
all things wedding.

110
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,306
All right.
Let's do this.

111
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,163
God, I love seeing you
with that checklist.

112
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:26,158
What a turn-on.

113
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,136
Why, thank you. Okay.

114
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:29,375
The caterer has our deposit.

115
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,986
The cake is confirmed
and so is the DJ.

116
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:32,631
I e-mailed all the
vendors and the guests

117
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:34,396
to remind them that the
marathon is this weekend,

118
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,431
so traffic will be crazy.

119
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:36,896
Look at you talking all dirty.

120
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,236
Lina has confirmed

121
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:40,401
that the wedding dress
is in transit.

122
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:43,118
And, ah. Now onto
some open questions.

123
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:46,386
- Hit me with them open questions.
- Are we...

124
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,341
sleeping together or apart
the night before the wedding?

125
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,456
- Together. Definitely.
- Agreed.

126
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:51,576
And I finished my vows.

127
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:53,186
- Mm.
- First time I've ever finished

128
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,311
a writing assignment on time.

129
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,179
First time I haven't.

130
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,386
B-Because of my book.

131
00:04:57,801 --> 00:04:59,466
Don't worry, I got this.

132
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:01,328
I'm not worried.

133
00:05:01,742 --> 00:05:03,331
But there is one more
thing we have to do.

134
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:04,396
What?

135
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:07,436
Practice our dance.

136
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,710
<i>Ew. Way too sweet.</i>

137
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:18,172
I don't want hearts
on the place cards.

138
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:19,632
We're not in third grade.

139
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:22,303
Are you sure
you don't want to invite

140
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:23,564
any more people
to the rehearsal dinner?

141
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:25,215
Hmm? Jane won't have
to spend a dime

142
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:26,725
of that book money...
It's my treat.

143
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:29,317
Nah. We want to
keep it small.

144
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,400
But if<i> you</i> want to
bring a plus-one...

145
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,617
Please. That's just not
what I'm about right now.

146
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:35,624
I am happily married
to the Marbella.

147
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:38,729
_

148
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:40,304
Now let's talk schedule.

149
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:42,315
Cocktail hour will be from 5:00
to 6:00, followed by dinner.

150
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,350
During dinner,
we'll do the toasts.

151
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,600
And yes,

152
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,770
- I will be making one.
- Oh, yeah?

153
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,770
Yes. And it's going to be
really funny.

154
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:51,675
<i>But Petra's not funny.</i>

155
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,336
I know. But she was so excited,
so just laugh

156
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:55,700
- whenever she pauses.
- I will.

157
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,150
Unless she
publicly fires someone.

158
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,320
How was the dress fitting?

159
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,185
Amazing. Lina crushed it.

160
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,521
I'm so happy.

161
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:03,823
Oh, I can't wait
to see you in it.

162
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:05,948
Oh. Love you.
See you at home.

163
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:07,910
- Jane?
- Hmm? Hey.

164
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,664
I got your e-mail,
and yes, we would love

165
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,634
for you to marry our spirits...
Though we are thinking

166
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:14,038
it's more of an after-ceremony
private thing.

167
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,218
Great. Um, but I was

168
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,263
actually hoping to talk to you
about something else.

169
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:19,043
<i>Uh-oh. That's never good.</i>

170
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:20,390
Of course. Sure.
What is it?

171
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,741
I found Rafael's birth parents.

172
00:06:23,782 --> 00:06:26,634
<i>Yes, friends,
looks like that last secret</i>

173
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,499
<i>will finally be revealed.</i>

174
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:35,271
<i>As you can imagine... or I can...</i>

175
00:06:35,412 --> 00:06:37,780
<i>There are so many ways
a story can end.</i>

176
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,671
You found Rafael's parents?

177
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:40,826
<i>Endings can be dramatic.</i>

178
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:42,145
Are they crime lords?

179
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,048
<i>Or shocking.</i>

180
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:44,538
Rose isn't his mother, is she?

181
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:46,208
<i>Or seemingly mundane.</i>

182
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,839
His parents were just...

183
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,508
regular people.

184
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:52,857
Were?

185
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,250
- They're dead.
- <i>Which, of course,</i>

186
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:57,379
<i>is a different kind
of ending altogether.</i>

187
00:06:57,404 --> 00:06:58,674
Oh, no.

188
00:06:59,388 --> 00:07:00,414
Here's everything

189
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,993
I could find out about them.

190
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:03,983
I thought...

191
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,780
you should be the one
to tell Rafael.

192
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:12,222
_

193
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:16,146
_

194
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:19,575
If I'm cold, I'll go shopping.

195
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,356
I hear there are stores
in New York.

196
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:22,755
_

197
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:25,489
_

198
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:27,395
_

199
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:32,513
_

200
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,005
Hey. Where's Mateo? I have
to get home to talk to Rafael.

201
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:37,805
Upstairs. He said he's working
on some big surprise for me.

202
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:42,385
Wha...?

203
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:44,425
Mateo, what did you do?

204
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,718
I unpacked you,
so now you don't have to move.

205
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,687
<i>Looks like Jane's son
doesn't like goodbyes, either.</i>

206
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:52,994
Mateo, sweetie,
Abuela still has to move.

207
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:53,829
Why?

208
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:56,520
You know why.
Because of Papa's show.

209
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:57,541
That's why Papa

210
00:07:57,566 --> 00:08:00,314
has to move, but Abuela
could stay here with us.

211
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:03,331
- No, I can't, sweetie.
- Yes, you can.

212
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:04,491
You just don't want to.

213
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:05,675
- That's not true.
- You could

214
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,795
- if you wanted to.
- It'll be okay, Mateo.

215
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,423
It's just like we talked about.

216
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:11,411
Okay? We'll FaceTime
every night.

217
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:13,694
It's not the same.

218
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:15,277
It's just not.

219
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:18,791
<i>Yeah, I know
how you feel, buddy.</i>

220
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,066
Hey.

221
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:25,626
- What took you guys so long?
- We had a little issue,

222
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,571
but we're doing better.
Right, Mr. Sweetface?

223
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:29,434
Can I sleep in bed
with you guys tonight?

224
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:32,694
No fair! If he gets
to, then we do, too.

225
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,762
- Yeah. And no tooting, Mateo.
- It's not tooting

226
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:38,003
- if I do it in my sleep.
- Uh, yes, it is.

227
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,998
- It's still tooting.
- Official ruling is...

228
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,514
- it's tooting!
- Yeah!

229
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,549
Hey, and try not to do
it in your sleep tonight, huh?

230
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,035
So, what do you say?

231
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:48,266
Family sleepover?

232
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:51,549
Okay, let's do it.

233
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:55,839
<i>Thank you.</i>

234
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,009
You are an excellent agent,
Barry.

235
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,306
Okay.

236
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:02,336
The network just dropped
the<i> This Is Mars</i> pilot online

237
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:06,008
to generate some buzz before it
officially starts airing in the fall.

238
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:07,430
- Wow.
- I just can't believe

239
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:08,709
it's finally being released

240
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:10,004
to American audiences.

241
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:11,454
People are watching it
right now.

242
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,529
Do you think there's buzz yet?

243
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:14,284
Probably not.

244
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:17,334
Xo...

245
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:18,481
it's happening.

246
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,459
#Mars is already trending.

247
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:22,794
America loves me!

248
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:27,699
Oh. Apparently,
America loves NASA.

249
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:29,969
They just landed
another rover on Mars.

250
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:33,164
Oh, I'll just help you repack
to take my mind off it.

251
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:35,059
But, I mean, it's exciting, no?

252
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:36,737
Lots of big changes ahead.

253
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:45,854
Luisa found my parents?

254
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:48,379
Yes. And I don't know
how to tell you this

255
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:49,980
except to just tell you.

256
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,804
They died in a car accident.

257
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:56,641
- Oh.
- I am so sorry.

258
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,609
They lived in Italy.

259
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:00,054
They owned a bakery.

260
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,943
- It's all in there.
- A bakery.

261
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,037
Wow.

262
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,508
How normal.

263
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,850
I-I guess I was expecting
something, um...

264
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,536
<i>Straight out of a telenovela?</i>

265
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:13,830
Bigger.

266
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:15,644
Crazier.

267
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,062
<i>Like I said.</i>

268
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:19,067
I know it's a terrible
time to find out,

269
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:20,363
right before the wedding.

270
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:21,722
No.

271
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,292
Actually, it's the perfect time.

272
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:29,346
I think a few months ago I
would have been devastated.

273
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:32,214
But all I can think
about right now is...

274
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,356
how much I<i> do</i> have.

275
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:37,653
I mean, I am literally
surrounded by family.

276
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,013
So how can I feel
anything but gratitude?

277
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,040
<i>It's like Chekhov's gun.</i>

278
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,450
<i>Had to go off!</i>

279
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:50,165
Oh.

280
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,569
I can't wait to marry you.

281
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:53,414
<i>Which brings us to...</i>

282
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:57,047
Jane, walk faster.

283
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:58,452
Girls, get back here.

284
00:10:58,522 --> 00:11:00,192
Mateo, why are your pants off?

285
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:01,544
<i>Luckily, just the rehearsal.</i>

286
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,791
_

287
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:05,427
Because this is
the third run-through, Abuela.

288
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,849
Never fear,

289
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:09,112
I am here.
_

290
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:11,127
Hello, Mother.

291
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:13,604
Oh. Come here, my beautiful boy.

292
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:16,407
I have missed you so much, mwah!

293
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,960
I'm gonna do
a reading at the wedding.

294
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,850
Oh, then you have
to practice projection,

295
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,520
so they can hear you
from the cheap seats.

296
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,850
Hello, darling.

297
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:28,771
_

298
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,661
Hi.

299
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:34,336
So, have you written
your vows yet?

300
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:36,547
Tonight. Oh.

301
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:39,150
Oh, my God.

302
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:40,759
The publisher is printing

303
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,354
advanced galleys
of my book this week.

304
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,679
They're sending them
to authors to review.

305
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:46,098
- What?!
- That's amazing.

306
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,377
But wait, that's not
even the best part.

307
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:50,699
One of the authors
is Isabel Allende.

308
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:52,314
Isabel Allende might write

309
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:53,911
a blurb for the back of my book!

310
00:11:56,452 --> 00:11:58,063
Oh, Lina, are you okay?

311
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,978
Yes. I'm sorry. I'm fine.

312
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,313
Mm-hmm. Go on.

313
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:04,338
Isabel Something. Yay!

314
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,119
Mm...

315
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:10,224
Okay, I was gonna wait
until after the wedding

316
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:11,361
to tell you, but...

317
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:14,995
- I'm pregnant.
- Oh, my God. Congratulations.

318
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:17,151
Oh...

319
00:12:17,176 --> 00:12:18,276
Which sister gave you an egg?

320
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,196
The pretty one, clearly.

321
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:22,446
- Alexis?
- Jackie.

322
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,381
That's what I meant. I just,
I mix them up all the time.

323
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:25,949
I am so happy for you,

324
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,280
oh, and your very lucky baby.

325
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:30,135
Okay, enough.

326
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,280
I'm supposed to be
gushing about you.

327
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,547
<i>Which, for the record, she did.</i>

328
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:39,686
People think I grew up
with four sisters...

329
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,754
but the truth is,
I grew up with five.

330
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,504
And I only liked one of them.

331
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:49,324
Jane, you are...

332
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,810
everything to me.

333
00:12:52,257 --> 00:12:55,119
The person I look up to
the most in this world,

334
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,507
the person I want to be
when I grow up.

335
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:01,341
And the one thing I know...

336
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:02,918
is that, uh,

337
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:05,560
becoming Jane's father

338
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,774
late in life,

339
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:09,859
has been...

340
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:14,359
well, the greatest joy
of my life.

341
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,148
It's true. And, uh,

342
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,193
tomorrow, I'm so thrilled
to be gaining a son.

343
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:24,294
So, Rafael,

344
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,574
I would be honored

345
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:28,276
if you call me Dad.

346
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,414
U-Uh... Thank you.

347
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,399
Thank you...?

348
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:42,723
Very much.

349
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:45,068
Well, you'll sort that out.

350
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:47,255
So,

351
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,160
anyway, there's been a lot
of tears shed here tonight,

352
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:51,325
so I think it's time
for some laughs.

353
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:55,908
I always knew Jane
was super into weddings,

354
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:57,907
because she was always marrying
the ketchups at work.

355
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,130
And Rafael, well,
he's always been...

356
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,116
Well, his shirts are so tight,

357
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:06,587
and his pants...

358
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:09,690
It's okay, Petra.

359
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,150
You don't have to be funny.

360
00:14:11,823 --> 00:14:13,190
No, I wrote these jokes
so I wouldn't

361
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:14,645
get emotional like this.

362
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,781
<i>Eh, I don't think it's working.</i>

363
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:20,272
I just love you two so much.

364
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:23,256
Your love is something
I aspire to.

365
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,880
And I wish you
all the happiness in the world,

366
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:29,557
which is a really weird feeling,

367
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:31,614
because I don't usually wish
happiness on other people.

368
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,507
- I love you.
- I love you.

369
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:39,551
Ah...

370
00:14:40,124 --> 00:14:43,261
Thank you so much, everyone.

371
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:46,083
We are just...

372
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:49,434
I also want to make a toast.

373
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:51,554
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

374
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:56,570
Jane, a long time ago,

375
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:59,253
I was going through
a rough time,

376
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,464
and I accidentally
inseminated you.

377
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:07,085
So I just want to take
this moment to say...

378
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:10,186
you're welcome.

379
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:15,346
<i>Suffice it to say,</i>

380
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:17,591
<i>on that night, there was love.</i>

381
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:24,561
<i>So much in fact, that suddenly
Jane realized something.</i>

382
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,391
Mm. You have
that look.

383
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:30,717
- You want to go write?
- Quickly. Is that okay?

384
00:15:30,742 --> 00:15:32,314
- Of course. Go.
- Okay.

385
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:34,190
Ugh.

386
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:40,857
So...

387
00:15:41,498 --> 00:15:43,387
you seemed a little
choked up about love.

388
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:46,482
Oh, please. Villanueva events
are<i> made</i> for people to cry.

389
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:47,705
It's just how
they're constructed.

390
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:49,702
It's fine. I'm fine.

391
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:52,301
Where did Jane run off to?

392
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,439
<i>Ah, there she is.</i>

393
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,928
Wow.

394
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:59,312
Somebody was inspired
by those speeches.

395
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,722
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone

396
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:04,267
that my wife, the writer,
plagiarized her vows.

397
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:07,772
Oh, I wasn't writing my vows.

398
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:11,352
I, uh... I-I just suddenly got
an idea for the end of my book

399
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,127
that would get me close to 100%,

400
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:15,902
and I e-mailed my editor to
see if she could get the file

401
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:18,842
into the printing press in time
to get it to Isabel Allende.

402
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:21,362
Got it.

403
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:22,977
I was gonna write my
vows later tonight.

404
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:24,247
Well, you know what they say.

405
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:26,476
It's always best
when you just slip 'em in

406
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,265
right under the deadline.

407
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:32,252
We should get back inside.
Dessert's coming.

408
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,540
<i>I definitely ate too much cake.</i>

409
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,392
Yeah. Me, too.

410
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:42,538
You're upset, and I get it.

411
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:45,121
I put Rafael on the spot,
but it came from a good place.

412
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:46,370
Rogelio, it's not that.

413
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,085
I need to tell you something.

414
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,059
I don't think
I could move to New York.

415
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:01,934
Wh-What do you mean,
you can't move to New York?

416
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:04,838
I just don't want
to leave my whole family.

417
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:06,993
And I've been trying
to push that feeling aside

418
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:10,178
and support you, but...
I really don't think

419
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:11,380
it's the right move for me.

420
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:13,443
I mean, I just started

421
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:15,388
getting into the groove
with my nursing program.

422
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:17,166
My life finally feels
like it's on track.

423
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:18,975
So? So wha-what are you saying?

424
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:20,978
Because I have to go.

425
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:22,312
I signed a contract.

426
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:25,278
Well, I was thinking,

427
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:27,095
maybe we should commute.

428
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:29,039
Just for this year.

429
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:31,115
I'll live here during the week,

430
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,470
and we'll travel
to each other on weekends.

431
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,183
Think about it.
Your hours are long anyway.

432
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:37,924
It's not like I'd even see you

433
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:39,123
during the week
when you're shooting.

434
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,553
I mean, I want you to be happy.

435
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:44,887
W-Will commuting make you happy?

436
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,383
I think it will.

437
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:49,217
Okay. Then...

438
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:51,100
let's do it.

439
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,100
Oh.

440
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:54,197
Thank you, Rogelio.

441
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,370
So I finished my vows.

442
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:07,367
And I'm so sorry about earlier.

443
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:09,946
No. No. I...
I overreacted.

444
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:12,432
Your book is so important.

445
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,069
<i>You're</i> important.

446
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,272
I just wasn't worried
about writing my vows

447
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,479
because I knew exactly
what I wanted to say.

448
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:23,329
Because I think about how lucky
I am to be with you every day.

449
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,102
And I'm so excited
about our wedding,

450
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:29,901
but I'm most excited
about our future together.

451
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,169
Because it's not like the
telenovelas I grew up watching.

452
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:37,382
The wedding isn't the end.

453
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,298
Our story is just beginning.

454
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,253
<i>Stop rubbing it in!</i>

455
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,469
Thanks.

456
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:47,512
I think I'm just feeling
a little vulnerable.

457
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:51,450
You know, last night you told me
my birth parents are dead,

458
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:53,065
and it didn't even faze me.

459
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,579
Because of how much I love you.

460
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,299
And that's a lot
to put on someone.

461
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:00,573
Not too much.

462
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,371
And just because
I can't wait for the future,

463
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:05,326
I don't want
to skip this moment.

464
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:07,134
So let's not wait.

465
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,609
Let's take our honeymoon
right away.

466
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:11,774
<i>OMG. Is it finally time</i>

467
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,960
<i>for that big splurge?</i>

468
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,715
And because
we never go on vacations,

469
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,313
I have a million points
for flights and hotels,

470
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:18,571
so we'll barely pay
for any of it.

471
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:20,266
<i>Nope, guess not.</i>

472
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:21,806
I'm in.

473
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:24,748
Oh.

474
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:29,207
Oh, no.

475
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:33,131
You have to go.

476
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:38,305
Turn around

477
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,383
and go back home.

478
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:40,788
Hello to you, too, Ma.

479
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,939
Abuela called.

480
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,301
Thank you, Abuela.

481
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:46,099
What do you mean
you're not moving?

482
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:51,049
I thought about it,
and it's just not what I want.

483
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:53,591
I mean, I shouldn't
have to upend my life.

484
00:19:53,616 --> 00:19:54,972
This isn't the 1950s.

485
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:56,978
You were the one who
looked into nursing schools.

486
00:19:57,003 --> 00:19:58,159
You said you wanted to go.

487
00:19:58,184 --> 00:20:00,154
And I changed my mind.
I want to stay here.

488
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:01,721
Because Mateo freaked out?

489
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:04,051
He's a kid, Ma.

490
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:05,436
He's also right.

491
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,800
I don't have to go
if I don't want to, and I don't.

492
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:10,805
I want to be here for things
like your book coming out,

493
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,826
and-and dinners
and birthdays, and-and...

494
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:14,972
_

495
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:23,237
It's so stupid.

496
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:27,046
I'm 46 years old,
and I've lived near you

497
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:28,736
for my whole life, Mom.

498
00:20:29,457 --> 00:20:31,047
And for<i> your </i>whole life.

499
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:33,675
<i>You'll recall our Jane
wasn't fond of endings.</i>

500
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:36,032
And now what? That's just over?

501
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:38,237
<i>A trait she got from her mother.</i>

502
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:39,379
_

503
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:41,651
_

504
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:44,963
_

505
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:48,373
_

506
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:51,019
_

507
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:54,912
_

508
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:58,807
_

509
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,231
_

510
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:05,073
_

511
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:15,441
You're coming with me
to New York?!

512
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,717
Oh, thank God. I'm so glad.

513
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:19,990
I love you so much.

514
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:22,868
And I love you, too!

515
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,610
Oh. Uh, thanks.

516
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:25,768
What are you doing here?

517
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:27,970
Oh. Oh, I just...
I just came...

518
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:30,605
to give you this...
for the wedding tomorrow.

519
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:35,200
Is that a... necklace?

520
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:38,086
Uh, I... I wasn't planning
on wearing any jewelry.

521
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,421
It's a<i> lazo de novia.</i>

522
00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:41,910
It's a Mexican wedding lasso.

523
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:44,931
Loved ones place it
around the bride and groom

524
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:47,309
during the ceremony
as a symbol of unity.

525
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:49,609
My-my father gave it to me,

526
00:21:50,195 --> 00:21:52,208
and now, I will like
to pass it on to you.

527
00:21:53,204 --> 00:21:54,771
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

528
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:57,111
Also, I wanted to apologize.

529
00:21:57,136 --> 00:21:59,320
I put you on the spot
with the whole "dad" thing.

530
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:00,592
I appreciate that.

531
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:04,210
But we're in private now, so...

532
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,955
if you want
to try it out, that's...

533
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,617
I'm sorry.

534
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:13,685
It just doesn't really
roll off the tongue,

535
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,650
but you know I love you.

536
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:22,304
Is everything okay?

537
00:22:22,412 --> 00:22:24,502
I don't know.
I'm... I'm blowing up.

538
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:26,581
Something's happening
online, but...

539
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,746
<i>And, friends,
that's when he realized...</i>

540
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:31,746
Oh, my God.

541
00:22:31,771 --> 00:22:33,551
My social media is exploding.

542
00:22:33,914 --> 00:22:35,071
I'm doubling...

543
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:37,573
No, tripling in followers.

544
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,596
Which means people
must be watching

545
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:42,211
the<i> This Is Mars</i> pilot.

546
00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:45,227
This could be it, Rafael.

547
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,226
I-I could be breaking through
in America.

548
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,039
Well, I hope so.

549
00:22:51,064 --> 00:22:53,154
Oh, yeah, me, too.

550
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:56,983
But-but-but we should keep this
between us right now

551
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,161
because I-I don't want to steal
Jane's thunder, you know.

552
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:00,756
She's getting married tomorrow.

553
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:02,285
As am I.

554
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:03,491
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

555
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,334
Our last night together.

556
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:07,018
I know.

557
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:09,005
_

558
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:11,166
_

559
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:13,446
_

560
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,902
_

561
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:18,913
Ah, man.

562
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:21,384
Who didn't turn out the lights?

563
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:25,484
Hey, I have a big day tomorrow,
remember?

564
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:29,176
I'm moving, it's so hard.

565
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:40,034
Okay, okay.

566
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:42,620
_

567
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,510
Love you, Abuela.

568
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:01,237
_

569
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:03,064
_

570
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:08,394
_

571
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:25,682
<i>I am overwhelmed</i>

572
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:27,562
by the love and support

573
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:28,772
in this room.

574
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:48,359
<i>Once upon a time, friends,</i>

575
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:50,932
<i>there was this very moment...</i>

576
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,105
<i>But alas,
the moment is already gone.</i>

577
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:53,239
- Everything okay?
- My editor.

578
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,704
It's not important.

579
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,769
Today is about...

580
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,000
him.

581
00:26:02,892 --> 00:26:04,232
<i>Hey, there, my groom.</i>

582
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,482
Hey, bride-to-be,
happy wedding day.

583
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:08,932
So, according to the schedule,

584
00:26:08,957 --> 00:26:10,377
hair and makeup should be arriving...

585
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,662
Ah, they just got here.

586
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:12,987
Oh, great.

587
00:26:13,012 --> 00:26:14,587
And did your editor
get your changes in time?

588
00:26:14,612 --> 00:26:16,832
No, but you know what?
It's fine.

589
00:26:16,902 --> 00:26:18,912
They'll make the switch when
they print the real book.

590
00:26:18,992 --> 00:26:21,542
But what about Isabel Allende?
She won't read your ending.

591
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:23,382
There must be something
you can do.

592
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:24,892
Nothing short of hand-delivering
a flash drive

593
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,307
to the printing press.

594
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:27,802
Which I would never do
on our wedding day.

595
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:29,112
Don't worry.

596
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,550
I have no interest
in running off

597
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:32,062
on some crazy adventure today.

598
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,972
I'll see<i> you</i> at the altar.

599
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,052
I love you.

600
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:36,448
I love you, too.

601
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:42,773
<i>Well, she might not be interested,</i>

602
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:45,725
<i>but it looks like he is.</i>

603
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:55,093
Hello? Hello?

604
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,082
Uh, can I help you?

605
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:00,185
Stop the presses.

606
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:03,108
Isn't that what they say?

607
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:04,626
<i>In the 1920s.</i>

608
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:05,963
I'm sorry.

609
00:27:05,988 --> 00:27:08,631
I-I have a-a huge favor
to ask you.

610
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:11,788
_

611
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:13,105
Oh, hey, thanks again, man.

612
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,378
- You're a lifesaver.
- No problem.

613
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:15,823
- Hey, good luck, buddy.
- Thank you!

614
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:29,293
Hello?

615
00:27:33,114 --> 00:27:34,242
Hello!

616
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:41,251
Ah, screw it.

617
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:45,967
Whoo!

618
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:48,276
<i>Guess Jane's
splurging on that gate.</i>

619
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:55,053
Oh.

620
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,386
Hi, almost-husband.

621
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:57,721
Don't worry, I'm right
on schedule.

622
00:27:58,164 --> 00:28:00,929
Yeah, our schedule might
have to change a little.

623
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:04,442
I got arrested and I need
to be bailed out.

624
00:28:09,878 --> 00:28:11,707
<i>Speaking of family stories,</i>

625
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,542
<i>this one would be
repeated often.</i>

626
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,367
And then he drove his car
through the gate

627
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:17,256
and got arrested so I have
to go get him.

628
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,161
But Mom took the car
to pick up Jorge.

629
00:28:19,186 --> 00:28:20,307
I'll call a car.

630
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:22,651
Jane, wait, let me go.

631
00:28:22,676 --> 00:28:24,671
- It's your wedding.
- That's why it has to be me.

632
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:26,356
What Raf did was so romantic,

633
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:28,131
I have to be the one
to go get him!

634
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:29,915
<i>Sure.</i>

635
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:31,033
<i>What could go wrong?</i>

636
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:38,780
Wha...?

637
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:41,110
Philipe, hey. What's going on?

638
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:42,392
It's been saying you're
ten minutes away

639
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:43,365
for about 20 minutes now.

640
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,390
I can't get to you
because of the marathon.

641
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:46,731
Can you meet me
on Plymouth Street?

642
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:48,061
It's just a few blocks away.

643
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:49,571
Uh, y-yeah, sure.

644
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:51,941
I-I'll be right there.

645
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:03,131
Yeah. Oh. Yikes!

646
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:04,474
Coming through!

647
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:05,848
Nice hair.

648
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:06,803
Thank you.

649
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:08,324
It's my wedding day!

650
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:09,543
Oh, sorry.

651
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:11,658
Got it! You got it!

652
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,354
- Keep going.
- Thank you.

653
00:29:18,313 --> 00:29:20,008
Ah, Philipe.

654
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:22,887
<i>And suddenly, in a moment</i>

655
00:29:22,912 --> 00:29:27,216
<i>of sheer coincidence or part
of the grand plan all along...</i>

656
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:29,687
_

657
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:33,452
Hop on, Jane.

658
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:42,262
_

659
00:29:42,287 --> 00:29:44,711
I am so sorry,
but is there any way

660
00:29:44,736 --> 00:29:45,759
that we could make
a quick detour

661
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,921
and stop at the police station?

662
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:48,198
<i>After all this time,</i>

663
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:49,866
<i>doesn't she know how buses work?</i>

664
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,927
You see, I'm getting married
today and, well,

665
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:53,718
my fiancé and I have been
through so much.

666
00:29:53,743 --> 00:29:55,715
An accidental insemination,
a kidnapping, an evil twin,

667
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,215
a husband returning
from the dead

668
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,740
and this is our last obstacle.

669
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:01,967
So I'm begging you...
Can you please help me?

670
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:03,831
No.

671
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,289
I will pay you $5,000
to rent out the whole bus.

672
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,871
<i>Guess Jane's finally decided
what to splurge on.</i>

673
00:30:09,896 --> 00:30:11,389
What about us?

674
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,090
How much you gonna pay us?

675
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,695
How's, uh, $50 each?

676
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:18,090
A hundred?

677
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,330
I got things to do, lady.

678
00:30:19,355 --> 00:30:21,131
I got to go to the bank,
the dry cleaners,

679
00:30:21,156 --> 00:30:22,392
- the nail salon...
- $200.

680
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:23,513
Final offer. Please.

681
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:24,991
I'm getting married
in 56 minutes.

682
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:30,586
That'll work.

683
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:31,821
Ah, great!

684
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:33,042
To the police station.

685
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,670
_

686
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,321
_

687
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,596
All right, we're good.

688
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:51,324
Oh.

689
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:53,108
Oh. Hey, Mom.

690
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,541
Where are you? We're all here.

691
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:56,116
I'm coming and I got the groom.

692
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:57,961
I'll text you the address
of where we'll pick you all up.

693
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:59,656
W-What are you driving?
Is it big enough?

694
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:01,811
Oh, yeah, i-it's big enough.

695
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:08,863
Make way! Make way!

696
00:31:08,888 --> 00:31:11,808
Wedding party of Jane Gloriana
Villanueva coming through!

697
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:15,367
It's okay!

698
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,999
Save the dress!

699
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:20,082
<i>And, friends, that's when...</i>

700
00:31:20,107 --> 00:31:21,407
Aren't you Rogelio De La Vega

701
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:22,751
from that show
that just dropped...

702
00:31:22,776 --> 00:31:24,106
The dude from <i>This Is Mars.</i>

703
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:26,136
Oh, yeah. You're hilarious, man.

704
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:27,881
Yes, yes, it is I.

705
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:29,983
Rogelio De La Vega.
American star.

706
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:31,888
<i>Which he will be
very shortly, friends.</i>

707
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,696
<i>In fact, here's a little taste
of what's to come.</i>

708
00:31:34,878 --> 00:31:36,180
_

709
00:31:36,205 --> 00:31:37,212
_

710
00:31:37,237 --> 00:31:38,046
_

711
00:31:38,071 --> 00:31:38,688
_

712
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:39,363
_

713
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:40,558
_

714
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:42,276
Cross over!

715
00:31:42,787 --> 00:31:43,658
Yes.

716
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:45,013
Come on! Hurry!

717
00:31:45,093 --> 00:31:46,763
Oh! Excuse me.

718
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,853
Jane, we're here.
Where are you?

719
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:51,127
Mom!

720
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:52,590
Let's go!

721
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:57,038
Ma'am... you, stand right here.

722
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:59,098
Sir, can you stand
right here, please?

723
00:31:59,123 --> 00:32:00,477
But don't look, either.
Turn around.

724
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,523
_

725
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:03,494
_

726
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:06,283
Oh, red light.
Hand me the eyeliner.

727
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:10,186
How's it going back there?

728
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:11,352
No! Don't look!

729
00:32:11,377 --> 00:32:12,227
Are you crazy?

730
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:15,031
You need help?

731
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:16,993
Oh, yeah, thank you.

732
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:19,821
_

733
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:22,696
Okay, we are now
officially late.

734
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:25,325
Don't sweat it; they
won't start without you.

735
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:28,896
I was a nervous groom
once, too, you know.

736
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:31,436
<i>Actually, three times,
but who's counting?</i>

737
00:32:31,461 --> 00:32:33,542
But you are going to get there,

738
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:37,096
and you are going to
be so happy together.

739
00:32:37,945 --> 00:32:39,671
Not always, of course.

740
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:41,912
At times, things
will be difficult.

741
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:44,965
And you will fight, and
you will stomp around...

742
00:32:45,394 --> 00:32:47,198
At least that's what I do.

743
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:49,978
But you will get
through the hard times,

744
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:52,763
because there will
be so much joy.

745
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:54,718
<i>Which was true, for the record.</i>

746
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:56,629
<i>So much joy.</i>

747
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,175
Thank you...

748
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,296
Rogelio is fine.

749
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:02,950
Now...<i> Inhala...</i>

750
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:05,476
<i>Exhala.</i>

751
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,030
Yeah.

752
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,620
<i>Everyone just relax.</i>

753
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,026
_

754
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,435
They'll be here any minute.

755
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,290
You know, I actually
didn't get to do,

756
00:33:13,315 --> 00:33:15,485
uh, some of my jokes
from the rehearsal dinner.

757
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,945
Anyone want to hear them now?

758
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,290
Not now, not ever.

759
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:20,765
Oh, my God.

760
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:23,460
She's here.

761
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,050
<i>OMG. I'm not ready!</i>

762
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,560
<i>Oh. Wrong Jane.</i>

763
00:33:29,295 --> 00:33:31,658
<i>But damn, she looks good!</i>

764
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,640
Oh!

765
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:36,849
What are you doing here?

766
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:38,440
Rafael called.

767
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,270
- He what?!
- Yeah, he told me that

768
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,320
you still had feelings for me,
and he made this big speech

769
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:45,665
about how life is too short,
and I know it's corny,

770
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,528
but my mom just died, and...

771
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:51,023
I've been thinking
about you so much lately.

772
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:52,645
And honestly,
I never stopped loving you,

773
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,095
and I just...

774
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,422
Mmm.

775
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,400
I love you, too.

776
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,995
And I'm so sorry
about your mother.

777
00:34:10,186 --> 00:34:11,351
Thank you.

778
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:13,085
I'm sorry about yours.

779
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,250
Oh, don't worry.
She's gone, too.

780
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,492
<i>Ah, yes, and let me
show you where she went.</i>

781
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,118
_

782
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:32,183
_

783
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,597
_

784
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:35,478
<i>What can I say but...</i>

785
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:38,380
<i>straight out of a telenovela.</i>
_

786
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:43,305
<i>Which brings us back...</i>

787
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,203
Here! We're here!

788
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:48,233
_

789
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:49,836
_

790
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:52,625
I couldn't be more ready.

791
00:34:58,101 --> 00:34:59,491
<i>As you well know,</i>

792
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:00,879
<i>because I've been telling you,</i>

793
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:03,501
<i>telenovelas end with a wedding.</i>

794
00:35:04,408 --> 00:35:06,766
<i>And after a long journey,</i>

795
00:35:07,134 --> 00:35:09,135
<i>we are finally at ours.</i>

796
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:11,557
Aw.

797
00:35:24,364 --> 00:35:25,397
Thank you.

798
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:39,629
Aw!

799
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:41,209
Oh!

800
00:35:54,994 --> 00:35:57,487
<i>It should be noted,
at this very moment,</i>

801
00:35:57,645 --> 00:35:59,575
<i>Jane's passions included...</i>

802
00:36:00,414 --> 00:36:02,018

Thank you all
for being here today.

808
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:40,380
To begin,
we have a selected reading

809
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:43,615
from<i> Love is You & Me.</i>

810
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,588
"Love is me, and love is you.

811
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,335
So when you smile,
I smile, too."

812
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,385
Aw.

813
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,677
"When you're around,
the skies are blue.

814

It's like being
happy times two."

815
00:37:05,386 --> 00:37:06,525
"Love is fun!

"It's feeling free!
Love lets you

817
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:10,102
be who you want to be!"

818
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,843
Wow. You're using
your big-boy voice!

819
00:37:11,868 --> 00:37:13,328
I practiced with Great Glamma.

820
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:15,773
She said I'd be great
at voice-over work.

821
00:37:16,312 --> 00:37:18,558
<i>And for the record, I am.</i>

822
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,403
<i>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

823
00:37:22,428 --> 00:37:24,928
Now, I will be speaking Spanish,

824
00:37:25,104 --> 00:37:27,673
so for those of you
who are Spanish-impaired...

825
00:37:28,574 --> 00:37:31,069
there are translations
in the programs.

<i>Which, for the record, was true.</i>

841
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:19,351
_

842
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:20,331
Oh.

843
00:38:20,356 --> 00:38:24,387

844
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:26,412

854
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:08,356
We place this around you

855
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:11,541
as a symbol of unity
and commitment.

856
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:13,661
Now the everlasting

857
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:16,456
bond between you is sealed.

858
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:19,288
Thank you...

859
00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:21,696
Dad.

860
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:23,513
Oh...

861
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:26,131
Mom?

862
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:27,221
No, thank you.

Jane...

866
00:39:41,603 --> 00:39:43,020
you made...

867
00:39:45,527 --> 00:39:46,611
Jane...

868
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:48,919
you made...

869
00:39:49,446 --> 00:39:50,973
Maybe you should go first.

870
00:39:57,823 --> 00:40:00,776
Rafael, the first time we met,

871
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:02,740
you told me to be brave,

872
00:40:03,406 --> 00:40:04,759
and...

873
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:06,714
Okay.

874
00:40:09,876 --> 00:40:11,072
Rafael...

875
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,526
- Maybe we should just...
- Yeah.

876
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:19,971
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Sorry. We're just gonna read...

877
00:40:20,106 --> 00:40:21,705
- them for ourselves.
- Yeah.

878
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:23,842
<i>Which, friends,</i>

879
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:25,481
<i>they did.</i>

880
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:33,475
Oh...

881
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,770
_

882
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:37,605
Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry, Abuela.

883
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:40,570
_

884
00:40:40,595 --> 00:40:41,805
Aw!

885
00:40:48,553 --> 00:40:50,275
_

886
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,197
_

887
00:40:55,413 --> 00:41:00,468
Rafael, receive this ring as a
sign of my love and fidelity.

888
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,154
Sorry.

889
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:06,774
- Sorry.
- Jane!

890
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,655
Jane,

891
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:18,206
receive this ring as a sign
of my love and fidelity.

892
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:20,520
Yeah. Yeah.

897
00:41:32,445 --> 00:41:33,665
Bravo!

898
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,947
Whoo!

899
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:47,168
Thank you, ladies.

900
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,461
<i>Groom! Groom! Dad,</i>

901
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:51,056
- get in here!
- Come on, baby.

902
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:52,946
<i>- Lovely.
- Oh, yes, come on, Mateo.</i>

903
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,572
Yes!
Oh, yes, Petra, get in here!

904
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:57,098
<i>- Come, come, come. Yes! Luisa!
- Luisa!</i>

905
00:41:57,319 --> 00:41:58,709
- Yes.
- Hi, Baby.

906
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:00,991
<i>H-Hold, hold. Hold on.
Hold on. Here.</i>

907
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:03,366
Yes...

908
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,766
- Darci...
- Oh, my God!

909
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,155
Mmm.

910
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:23,455
Should we go back inside?

911
00:42:24,698 --> 00:42:26,775
Let's just sit here
for another minute.

912
00:42:31,286 --> 00:42:33,261
So, I never asked you.

913
00:42:33,286 --> 00:42:34,364
Hmm?

914
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:36,738
What happens
at the end of your book?

915
00:42:38,237 --> 00:42:40,220
They make it into a telenovela.

916
00:42:41,432 --> 00:42:43,250
Well, who'd want to watch that?

917
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,252
