Fished a radio collar out
of the Yellowstone River.

Seen any wolves around lately?

5
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,562
Sounds like poachers.

6
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,497
- Sure does.
- Care to ride with us?

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,599
Monica wants to have a funeral.

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,535
She wants him here
where she can visit.

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,672
Whatever she wants,
you... You give it, son.

10
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,739
I can't serve both.

11
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:33,076
I choose her and
I choose my son.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,112
You promised and you took
millions in lease payments!

13
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,146
You have no case.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,814
And you know it.

15
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,984
You're better than I expected.

16
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:45,755
I am here just to
find a soft landing.

17
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,424
How busy are you tomorrow night?

18
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,893
New York would
like to drop the suit.

19
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:53,896
Find a way to ruin
this family, Ellis.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,564
Hey, let's go to a
bar in Bozeman.

21
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,167
Yeah, that's a bad
idea every time.

22
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,103
Aren't you a tall
drink of water?

23
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,737
I'm married. Go on.

24
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,231
I'm taking your husband home.

25
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,614
What day is it?

26
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,585
Thursday, I think.

27
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,533
What happened to you?

28
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,436
Fucking men.

29
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,382
Worked you over
pretty good, huh?

30
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,009
I'm talking about the
cop that arrested me.

31
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:55,625
Prick is in the club
three nights a week.

32
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,284
He can't cut me a break?

33
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,188
They get you for D.U.I.?

34
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,790
Aggravated assault.

35
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,805
Some bitch from California
tried to fuck my husband

36
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,240
so I beat her
with a beer bottle.

37
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,377
So, you're like a
fucking criminal.

38
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,103
I am the wrath of
a woman scorned.

39
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,305
Call it what you will.

40
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,186
It's always some
bitch from California.

41
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,276
Every fucking time.

42
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,814
Bethany Dutton. Let's go.

43
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,461
You don't look like a Bethany.

44
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,997
I'm not a Bethany. I'm a Beth.

45
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,912
My hero.

46
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,371
Knock when you're done.

47
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,222
Boy, you have really
fucking done it this time.

48
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:00,257
What's the big deal, Jamie?

49
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,891
I got into a bar
fight in Bozeman.

50
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:04,728
I mean, Montana Board of Tourism

51
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,462
should put that
on fucking t-shirts.

52
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,465
I don't think the
Montana Board of Tourism

53
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,766
is too fond of locals
beating the shit

54
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,968
out of tourists on vacation.

55
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,837
Well, that's why I called you.

56
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,507
You can find the rug to
sweep this under, right?

57
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,165
There is no rug
for this one, Beth.

58
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,909
It's a County Attorney issue.

59
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,812
So your best bet is to hope
this woman has a plane to catch

60
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,981
or she's too hungover
to come down here

61
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,817
and file formal charges.

62
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,554
This is your legal advice?

63
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:31,888
Sit here and hope?

64
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:37,060
It's not advice. It's
your only option.

65
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,795
If she doesn't file charges,

66
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,864
and that's a big fucking
"if" considering the photo

67
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,866
I saw of the grapefruit
on her forehead,

68
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,269
then I will ask the
County Attorney

69
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,305
to show some mercy based
on your diminished capacity

70
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,299
to control your
fucking emotions.

71
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,038
So, yeah, you just
sit here and hope.

72
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,621
But no matter what, if
this reaches the press,

73
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:05,621
it's a big embarrassment
for our father.

74
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,979
You mean my father.

75
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,419
Your father's out of chances to
be embarrassed, isn't he, Jamie?

76
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,331
I'm going to go back to my cell.

77
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,401
I'm going to take a nap.

78
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,370
And you're going to sit on
the fucking steps of this place

79
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,572
and you're going to
wait for Miss California

80
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:27,143
to walk up, and when she
does, you are going to stop her.

81
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,470
How the hell am
I going to do that?

82
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,473
It's not my problem, Jamie.

83
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:12,048
Hey. You got this
Dutton assault case?

84
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,716
Uh, yes, sir.

85
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,819
Why no charges
against the complainant?

86
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,221
It was a bar fight, wasn't it?

87
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,346
It was one hell of a
bar fight from the report.

88
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,315
There is no self
defense in a bar fight,

89
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,411
which is to say the victim
is a defendant as well.

90
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,696
Is she coming in?

91
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,966
- I'm waiting for her now.
- I'll wait with you.

92
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,247
You have the Montana
Educators Luncheon at noon.

93
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,283
Cancel it.

94
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,341
Governor, I think that
sends the wrong message.

95
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:53,856
All right, who exactly attends
the Montana Educators Luncheon?

96
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,259
Everyone. Senator
Perry will be there.

97
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,060
Legislators, School
Superintendents,

98
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,528
the President of Montana State.

99
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,387
Why do they call it the
Educators Euncheon

100
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,889
if there's no educators there?

101
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,004
It's Thursday, Clara, all
the educators are in school.

102
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,773
Tell you what, when
the Educators' Luncheon

103
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:12,199
is about teachers, I'll go.

104
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,884
Who are they?

105
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,511
It's the policy
advisors' meeting.

106
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,413
Policy advisors for who?

107
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,216
For you.

108
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,598
How can my policy
advisors have a meeting

109
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,389
about policies without me?

110
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,026
Um...

111
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,110
You're in my seat.

112
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:04,451
So what policies are
we discussing today?

113
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:09,557
Nobody?

114
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,893
Let's see...

115
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,540
"In accordance with
the U.S. Green initiative,

116
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:21,545
"Montana is leasing 7,000
acres in Powder River County

117
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,379
to Sun Energies."

118
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,281
What is Sun Energies?

119
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,384
It's a solar farm company.

120
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,154
Mm. And you are?

121
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,189
Stanley... Roberts.

122
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,024
And you are?

123
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,562
Your chief policy
advisor, Mr. Governor.

124
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,830
Well, nice to fucking meet you.

125
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,099
I tried to schedule
a lunch but you're...

126
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,125
She said you aren't
taking lunches.

127
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,071
Where's your office, Stanley?

128
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,105
Just... Right down the hall.

129
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,408
Know what? So is mine.

130
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,778
Ever dawn on you just to
come by and say howdy?

131
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,114
My mistake.

132
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,615
I'd say.

133
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,120
Let's see what other
policies I'm proposing.

134
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,755
Suspend natural gas
leases on state land

135
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,625
in Powder River
County to support

136
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,817
the Sage Grouse
Restoration Project.

137
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,602
Um, there's been a precipitous
drop in sage grouse numbers

138
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,437
and there is empirical evidence

139
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,673
that gas exploration
and extraction

140
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:27,711
have a negative impact on
the sage grouse environment.

141
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,612
And what effect do you
think seven thousand acres

142
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,314
of solar panels are going to
have on their environment?

143
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,350
There's... no evidence
that solar panels

144
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,419
would have any impact on
the sage grouse environment.

145
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,621
What do they do
with the sage brush

146
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,456
when they put in
the solar panels?

147
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,259
They, they...

148
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,794
They would clear it before
putting in the solar panels.

149
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,963
They remove the sage brush.

150
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,232
Yes, sir.

151
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,325
Sage grouse live
in the sage brush.

152
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:54,903
They do.

153
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,039
And you don't think
removing the sage brush

154
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,075
is going to have an
effect on the population?

155
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,576
I just said
there's no evidence...

156
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,971
Know what scares me about
you, Stanley? You're serious.

157
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,984
You're looking at me
and you're not joking.

158
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,619
I think tops on my agenda today

159
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:13,623
is going to be budget
discipline. You're all fired.

160
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,390
I'm very mindful of
our tax payers' money,

161
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,125
and you are all wasting it.

162
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,629
I'll advise myself
on policy, Clara.

163
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,264
How much money did we just save?

164
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,067
I would say...

165
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,836
Roughly 1.6 Million
dollars in salary and benefits

166
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,270
if you're serious.

167
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,962
Oh, I'm pretty serious.

168
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,433
Look at that.

169
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,246
What a great day for
the State of Montana.

170
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,115
Where to next?

171
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,818
We have an emergency
meeting with park officials

172
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,610
and U.S. Fish and Wildlife.

173
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,890
Emergency meeting about what?

174
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,424
Doesn't say.

175
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,927
Usually means
someone died in the park.

176
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,251
They're in your office.

177
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,702
What's the emergency?

178
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:03,339
Governor, we'd like for you
to take a look at this map.

179
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,241
The red lines indicate the
path of a radio-collared wolf

180
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,245
associated with the
Rescue Creek pack.

181
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,714
All right.

182
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:11,847
As you can see...

183
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,548
Wherever we see these clusters,

184
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,719
we associate with a kill site.

185
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:18,520
They'll feed on a carcass for a
few days, then they'll move on.

186
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:22,091
They left the park here
roughly three weeks ago,

187
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,960
they traveled the
tree line to here,

188
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,485
then they dropped down
in this valley to here.

189
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,265
Mm hm.

190
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,467
That's my ranch.

191
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,659
We're aware.

192
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,538
The wolves clustered
here for three days,

193
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,942
around what
appears to be a kill,

194
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:42,335
then they move straight
south for thirty miles to here.

195
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,814
Now, that's the
Yellowstone River...

196
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,118
They jump into the river,
according to this data

197
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,077
and they swim
downstream for five miles.

198
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,457
Wasn't aware wolves
swam down rivers.

199
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,893
They don't.

200
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,962
We recovered one of the
radio collars from the river.

201
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,764
What are you getting at?

202
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,767
We think the wolves
were killed on your ranch

203
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,225
and the collars
transported back to the park.

204
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,408
You think my cowboys
killed those wolves.

205
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,036
We think your cowboys
killed those wolves.

206
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,528
<i>Yes sir?</i>

207
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,963
We had any wolves
messing with the cattle?

208
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,365
<i>Wolves? No sir.</i>

209
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,635
<i>Fish and Wildlife came
by asking the same thing.</i>

210
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,727
All right.

211
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,109
There you have it.

212
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,812
Look, if they get
into your cattle

213
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,413
you gotta do what you gotta do.

214
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,350
They shot them from a distance

215
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,821
didn't notice the collar,

216
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,355
got spooked and tried
to cover their tracks.

217
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,958
These radio collars
aren't monitored by us.

218
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,094
An NGO pays for this research,

219
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,830
and they have the
same data we have

220
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,565
and they are going to
draw the same conclusion.

221
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,835
When they do,

222
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,939
they will come after you
with both barrels, Governor.

223
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,495
Look forward to it.

224
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:18,730
Anything else?

225
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,410
Thank you, gentlemen.
Governor, we have the...

226
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,870
Yep.

227
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,961
Environmental groups
can be a real problem.

228
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,129
Yeah, you don't say.

229
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,903
This is Clara.

230
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,538
<i>It's Jamie, let me speak to him.</i>

231
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,998
Attorney general.

232
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,676
Yeah?

233
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,610
All right, there is a good
chance I can make this go away.

234
00:13:55,634 --> 00:14:00,349
But, in case I can't,
I need you to know

235
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,585
<i>that I'm in police
station in Bozeman</i>

236
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,419
<i>hoping to convince a
young woman to drop</i>

237
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,956
the aggravated assault
charges she plans

238
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,681
to file against your daughter.

239
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,086
This fucking day.

240
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,332
Can I, uh...

241
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,567
<i>Can I have a little
more context, Jamie?</i>

242
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:22,304
Yeah, she mouthed
off to Beth in a bar

243
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,240
and it went about
how you'd expect.

244
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,500
<i>All right. Just, uh,
keep me posted.</i>

245
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:35,484
Is there a crisis manager
on my team, by any chance?

246
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:39,422
Well, that would be your press
secretary who you never hired,

247
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,548
so I guess your
crisis manager is me.

248
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,461
Can I have a minute?

249
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,465
<i>Having fun yet?</i>

250
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,466
No chance you'd
want to change jobs?

251
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,101
<i>You'd hate this one more.</i>

252
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,504
Any chance you're in Helena?

253
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,206
<i>A good chance.</i>

254
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,177
- Lunch plans?
<i>- Not anymore.</i>

255
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,379
<i>- You know Benny's Bistro?</i>
- Sure.

256
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,614
- Noon?
<i>- You made my day.</i>

257
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,176
Yeah, maybe you can
make mine. See you in a bit.

258
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,523
Yes, sir.

259
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,078
Miss Brewer.

260
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,014
I understand
you'd like to press.

261
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,471
Very much.

262
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,090
I feel I must
point out that by doing so,

263
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,725
you are exposing
yourself to prosecution.

264
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,695
How am I doing that?

265
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,498
There is no self defense
claim in a bar fight.

266
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,000
I assume you had been
drinking, and I understand you

267
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:01,236
approached Miss Dutton
and instigated the incident.

268
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,539
I didn't instigate anything.

269
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,033
Oh, um...

270
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,412
Let me see.

271
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,081
Yeah, you approached
Miss Dutton and stated,

272
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,018
"I'm taking your husband home.

273
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,485
"You can come with us and watch

274
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,455
or he can tell you
about it tomorrow."

275
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,880
Are those not your words?

276
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,226
I mean...

277
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,052
I was kidding.

278
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,197
Mm.

279
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,057
She didn't find it very funny.

280
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,158
No shit.

281
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,173
Making statements or actions
that threaten harm to another

282
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:42,510
or make them feel they
are in danger is assault.

283
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,246
You don't have to hit
somebody to commit assault,

284
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,048
you just have to
present a threat.

285
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,583
You presented the threat.

286
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,686
So if you press charges

287
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,421
the state must press
charges against you.

288
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,389
And since you are not
a resident of Montana,

289
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:58,193
you present a flight risk
and you bail will be withheld.

290
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,528
Do you understand
what that means?

291
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,365
So she just...

292
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,766
She just gets away with it?

293
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,334
She didn't get
away with anything.

294
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,703
She spent the night in jail
and she's going to be charged

295
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,273
with disorderly conduct.

296
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,276
The choice is yours.

297
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,279
I can't wait to get
out of this state.

298
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,747
Those fucking hillbillies.

299
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,449
Well, the feeling is mutual.

300
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,318
May I leave?

301
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,876
Please.

302
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,451
Saved me a ton of paperwork.

303
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,586
Thanks.

304
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,490
Happy to help.

305
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,980
What're they doing?

306
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,039
For Kayce's boy is my guess.

307
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,910
They told us this spot.

308
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,213
If I would've known I would
have dug that hole for you.

309
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:34,140
We don't mind. It's
part of the ceremony.

310
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,650
There's a dead horse over there.

311
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,851
When did he die?

312
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,320
He died Monday.

313
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,322
I got an excavator coming
out tomorrow to bury him.

314
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,623
We'll bury him now.

315
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,583
We'll put him in the
ground beside the boy.

316
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,618
Can I ask you why?

317
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,533
You can ask, but I
ain't gonna answer.

318
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,501
Kayce's all right
with this, then?

319
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,961
He knows.

320
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,005
Well, you're gonna
need a big hole.

321
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,375
Jake, Ethan, run
back to the barn

322
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,677
and grab us a bunch of shovels.

323
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,604
I'll help you, Mo.

324
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,034
Thank you.

325
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,880
Don't wish for
what you don't want.

326
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,856
You're in it now, John.
You might as well accept it.

327
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,296
All right.

328
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,801
Explain this job to me,
because it makes no sense.

329
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:03,571
All I do is go to middle
schools and ribbon cuttings.

330
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,340
Well, when the
legislature's in session

331
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:08,343
you'll be praying
for ribbon cuttings.

332
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,446
At the end of the day,
Montana is a business...

333
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,982
12,000 employees,
600,000 customers,

334
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,619
and you're the CEO,
and that's all there is.

335
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,053
And you really need to
change your perspective

336
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,122
about these school
meetings, too.

337
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,325
You know, these kids are gonna
remember meeting the governor

338
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,926
for the rest of their lives.

339
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,361
And who knows, you might
even inspire one of them

340
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,029
to become the governor one day.

341
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,497
I mean, that's
how I was inspired.

342
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,866
All right, point taken.

343
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,336
I stepped on a few
land mines it appears.

344
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,903
Already?

345
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,805
Others stepped on them for me.

346
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:42,810
Seems my daughter
got herself into a bar fight

347
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,413
and has been arrested.

348
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:48,351
I'm sorry. It's not funny.

349
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,118
I can see how that's
funny to anybody but me.

350
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,155
All right, well, if it doesn't
go away, just ignore it.

351
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,358
You don't comment
on your personal family.

352
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,926
You love your daughter and
hope she learns from her mistakes.

353
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,463
If she's convicted,
what are my...

354
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,864
what are my options?

355
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,066
You have none.

356
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,669
Well, I take that back,
you could pardon her,

357
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,839
but that's officially the end
of your political career, so...

358
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,642
I don't have to wait
until the end of my term

359
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,010
to pardon someone?

360
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,679
I would strongly advise it

361
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,415
but no, you have the
authority to pardon,

362
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,617
to commute sentence,
grant clemency,

363
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:24,051
whenever you want.

364
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,720
But once you open
that Pandora's Box,

365
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,523
it does not close, so...

366
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,816
Next land mine?

367
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,896
Environmental
groups relating to...

368
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:35,997
wolves.

369
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,934
- Avoid them at all costs.
- Yeah.

370
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,903
Buffalo and wolves were
the bane of my two terms.

371
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,204
They are kryptonite.

372
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,807
You need to stay
away and try like hell

373
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,409
to avoid taking a position.

374
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:50,678
And you need to get an
environmental advisor.

375
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,781
Not one of your rancher
buddies, an environmentalist.

376
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,684
Someone who understands
the way that they think

377
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:01,155
so they can explain to you
what the hell it is they're thinking.

378
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,157
Here's my best
advice about this job.

379
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,560
Good governors initiate action,

380
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:10,164
and bad governors spend
all their time reacting.

381
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:13,159
There are plenty of things to
clean up besides an airport.

382
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,842
You're the only man I know
who would actually pout

383
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,778
over winning the
election that he entered.

384
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,171
I'm not pouting.

385
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:32,253
Skulking, maybe,
but... not pouting.

386
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:37,115
You know, this is as much
your legacy as that ranch.

387
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,463
You're a smart woman, Lynelle.

388
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,390
Oh, you're just
figuring that out?

389
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,192
Just enjoy your
lunch, John. It's on me.

390
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,811
Disorderly conduct?

391
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:08,723
Way to go.

392
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,024
You're welcome.

393
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,326
Now I gotta pick up
trash on the highway

394
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,819
with all my fucking free time.

395
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:20,802
Which car is yours?

396
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,504
I can't take you back.
I have to go to Helena.

397
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,139
- Which one?
- I'm serious.

398
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,341
Well, how do you want
me to get home, Jamie?

399
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:31,136
Huh? Want me to hike
my skirt up on the on-ramp?

400
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:33,778
I doubt it'd be the first time.

401
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,369
What the fuck is that?

402
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,638
What's what?

403
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,640
The baby seat. What
the fuck is that for?

404
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,731
You have a child?

405
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,138
Do you have a child, Jamie?

406
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,844
A boy.

407
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:23,789
God gave you a boy?

408
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,696
You have my
womb cut out of me...

409
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:34,500
and God gave you a boy?

410
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:43,710
Fuck you!

411
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,023
Beth?

412
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,592
Let me guess, is
it that brood mare

413
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,193
of a fucking campaign manager?

414
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,396
- Yes.
- I saw her coming.

415
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,932
Beth.

416
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:01,202
Come on, Beth.
Beth, stop, stop, stop!

417
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:06,307
Taking you to that clinic is
the greatest regret of my life.

418
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,843
Of all the awful shit
that you have done

419
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,045
in your 45 years on this planet,

420
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,981
Jamie, that is... that is
really saying something.

421
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,207
What...

422
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,176
What did you name him?

423
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,413
He's named after me.

424
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,928
Of course he is!

425
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,362
That's what the
world fucking needs.

426
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,463
Another fucking you.

427
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,156
Beth.

428
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,401
Dad doesn't know about
this. Nobody knows about this.

429
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:36,327
Don't worry about
me telling him.

430
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,644
I'm gonna take him from you.

431
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:47,048
I'm going to rob you
of fatherhood, Jamie.

432
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,116
You don't deserve it.

433
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,742
And he deserves better than you.

434
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,289
Next time you see him,
you can kiss him goodbye,

435
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:57,826
because he's as good as gone.

436
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,036
Car trouble?

437
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,583
Actually, I just
got out of jail.

438
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,386
And when they let you
out, they just let you out,

439
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,788
there's no, uh, no
phone call to a friend

440
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,456
or a bus ticket.

441
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,584
Just, you know, let
you out on the street.

442
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:46,233
Seems an unfair policy
toward one who is clearly

443
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:50,962
having trouble coping in
society, don't you think?

444
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:54,876
Definitely creates, uh...

445
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,578
Additional challenges for sure.

446
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:58,670
Right?

447
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,275
- Do you need a...
- Ride?

448
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,978
I'd love one.

449
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:12,417
Thank you.

450
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,823
What are the odds that
you have a cigarette?

451
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,891
Not good.

452
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,438
Well, aren't you cute?

453
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,141
Mom's gonna kill you, Dad.

454
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,076
Is Mom the jealous type?

455
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,303
Mom wears the pants,
if you know what I mean.

456
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:38,009
Sister, I know exactly
what you mean.

457
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:02,634
Stop the car.

458
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,538
Nobody told me.

459
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,242
He didn't tell anybody.

460
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,846
Just pulled up and
saw all the cars.

461
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,219
Should we, uh, get closer?

462
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,823
I think this is as close
as they want us, Dad.

463
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:43,835
So how was jail?

464
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,181
Loud-mouthed pussy.

465
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,683
You and I are going
to have a long talk later.

466
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,284
Yeah, well, I'm
going to sleep later.

467
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,676
We'll have a short one now then.

468
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,980
Impulse control.

469
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:57,983
Find some.

470
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,569
I don't think they want us here.

471
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:22,984
Even if they don't want us,

472
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,875
they need to know
we care enough to stay.

473
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,491
Make me a promise.

474
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:33,194
Don't ever let
them do that to me.

475
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,354
Turn me to ashes and
throw me to the wind.

476
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,289
That's all the care I want.

477
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,157
John.

478
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm not sure the protocol.

479
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:51,673
There's no protocol now.

480
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,098
Ceremony's over.

481
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,367
I wish I'd known.

482
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,704
Grief isn't meant to be shared.

483
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,251
But comfort is.

484
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,411
They could use some now.

485
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:14,585
John...

486
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:19,791
This isn't the place
but we do need to talk.

487
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,369
About what?

488
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,606
About the three hundred
jobs you eliminated

489
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,409
when you canceled
the airport project.

490
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:31,278
A lot of very unhappy
people on the Reservation.

491
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:35,216
Can you meet me at
the Capitol tomorrow?

492
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,043
I think you should meet
me on the Reservation.

493
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:40,378
Show the people you
care enough to visit.

494
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:44,882
I can do that.

495
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,476
I know how you feel.

496
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,047
I wished I didn't, but I do.

497
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,229
I buried a son right over there.

498
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,521
I remember.

499
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,460
Blaming yourself, aren't you?

500
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,233
Yeah, I did that, too.

501
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,202
Still do some days.

502
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:43,184
I'll tell you something
I've never told anybody.

503
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,352
I had a brother for
about eighteen hours.

504
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,655
His name was Peter.

505
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,191
He was born early,

506
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:53,760
and his little heart
wasn't strong enough.

507
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,829
Not much they could
do back in those days.

508
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,889
Not a lot they can do now.

509
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:03,405
So, they just gave
him back to my mother.

510
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:06,273
The doctors hoped
and we prayed and...

511
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,632
neither worked.

512
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,777
And it changed my
mother. It hardened her.

513
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:14,905
She never... she never
tried to have children again.

514
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:20,053
Years later, I was grown
and Lee had just been born.

515
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:24,226
Both my parents are looking
at him, taking turns holding him.

516
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,027
And my father got
white as a ghost,

517
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:30,231
looked at my mother and said,

518
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,922
"Peter lived a perfect life.

519
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,669
"All he saw of
this planet was you

520
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,429
and all he knew
was you loved him."

521
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:43,945
That boy lived a
perfect life, Monica.

522
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,036
We're the only ones
who know it was brief.

523
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:50,409
All he knew was you
and that you loved him.

524
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,688
Thank you.

525
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,123
Named him after me.

526
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,793
I did.

527
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,331
Means more than
you'll ever know, son.

528
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,001
I know what it means.

529
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,806
Yeah.

530
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,053
Hang on to this.

531
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,488
Even if you don't use it,

532
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:05,351
now is not the time to
stop drawing a paycheck.

533
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,432
I'll find someone
to take your place

534
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,990
if that's what you want.

535
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,094
It's what I want.

536
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,523
Looks like you
got tossed off one.

537
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:49,370
Just been digging graves.

538
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:52,262
Horses go in the
field, you know that.

539
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:54,876
Yeah, I know but they
wanted it beside the boy.

540
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,166
Didn't figure you'd say no.

541
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,737
They say why?

542
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:04,775
My guess is the boy has
something to ride into Heaven.

543
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,791
Uh, the Poison Creek
outfit, they reached out,

544
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,392
they're short handed to brand.

545
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,695
They wanted our help
so, if you're all right with it,

546
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,697
go over there tomorrow.

547
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:18,064
When are we starting?

548
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:19,601
Well, next week.

549
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,068
You plan on being
here, don't you?

550
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,070
I mean, it's not my place to...

551
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,963
- I'll be here.
- All right.

552
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,447
Park Rangers came and asked me

553
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,449
some question about
wolves that held up here.

554
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:38,485
You know anything about that?

555
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,122
Mm. They pulled down a cow,

556
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,791
and I asked Ryan to
go out and shoot 'em.

557
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,861
He shot the ones with
the damn collars on 'em.

558
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,532
I was worried that it was
going to cause you a problem

559
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,901
so I tried to outsmart
'em and I guess I didn't.

560
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,204
So, I'm sorry, sir.

561
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,206
Where are the wolves now?

562
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,467
In a place that nobody
will ever find them.

563
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,521
Horses in heaven.

564
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,623
Mm-hm. That's the
best I could figure it.

565
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,052

Bout the same as last year.

613
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:28,742
But we won't add any
yearlings this year though.

614
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,713
Not with diesel prices and corn.

615
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:34,247
- No.
- Shit.

616
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,606
When this finally makes
it to the butcher shop,

617
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:38,043
it's gonna sting.

618
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,646
It's good to see your boy back.

619
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:46,526
It's just for the summer.

620
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:51,097
He graduated,
got a job in Boise.

621
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,735
But my daughter wants to stay.

622
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:55,535
We'll see if I can make
a cowboy out of her

623
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,572
shit-for-brains husband.

624
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:00,907
Only thing he seems
to like making is babies.

625
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,367
Is that right?

626
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:07,981
World sure is
shrinking where you are.

627
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,516
It's good to see that
airport squashed.

628
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,119
That ain't gonna
change nothing, Delbert.

629
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:16,757
I mean, shit, it might
slow it down a bit.

630
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:19,684
At least the world hasn't
found out about this place yet.

631
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:24,588
It breaks my heart to think of
the world we're leaving them.

632
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,525
Breaks my heart, too.

633
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,996
Hell, I don't even
have any kids.

634
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,722
Higgins.

635
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,248
What took you so long?

636
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,041
I've only been Governor a week.

637
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,710
I see you survived.

638
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,590
- Thank you.
- Well, there's a catch.

639
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,360
A catch?

640
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:01,327
Yeah, it's a supervised
release for six months.

641
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:03,454
Supervised by who?

642
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:05,556
You're looking at him.

643
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:10,303
So, you release me from
prison just to kidnap me?

644
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,706
More or less. Need your help.

645
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:15,541
With what?

646
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:17,378
Help me understand you.

647
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:20,447
Help me understand
the way you think.

648
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:22,483
What do I get in return?

649
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:25,085
You just got it. Get in.

650
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,521
- Where am I staying?
- With me.

651
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:30,323
I'm no political strategist

652
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,693
but granting clemency to a
woman you're shacking up with

653
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:35,428
in the Governor's mansion
lends itself to some negative press.

654
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,898
At the ranch.

655
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:39,900
Oh, great. With your
bi-polar sociopathic daughter?

656
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:41,525
She's hardly ever there.

657
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:49,642
So you know, I just
went a year without sex,

658
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,245
which is the longest I've
gone since the first time I had it,

659
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,547
and I'm still not fucking you.

660
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,650
Oh, God.

661
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:00,244
Our relationship will
be purely professional.

662
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,585
Let her in.

663
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,748
Miss Atwood.

664
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:31,617
Oh, come on. It's
Sarah. Have a seat.

665
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:34,120
I took the liberty of
ordering us a bottle of Rosé.

666
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:37,090
I hope you don't mind.

667
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,960
Well, can't say
I've ever had it.

668
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:42,695
Oh. Well the French,

669
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,255
they drink it like
water in the summer.

670
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,161
Try it.

671
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:00,304
It's refreshing.

672
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:05,909
It's nice.

673
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:11,882
What?

674
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:16,162
Oh, I'm just trying to decide

675
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,498
the best path forward.

676
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,633
How do we manage this?

677
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,403
How do we as a company, recover?

678
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,472
How do we save face?

679
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:27,840
But most importantly, how
do we reverse his decision?

680
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:30,643
Either reverse his decision
or get our money back.

681
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:32,812
I mean, the state is facing
a multi-billion dollar lawsuit

682
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,314
and you know it.

683
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,182
You won't win.

684
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:38,151
With some of the
most vital elements

685
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,686
of your development now
in a Conservation Easement,

686
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,246
the argument is moot.

687
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,251
We don't have to win.

688
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:51,032
We just need to
keep it in the news long enough

689
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:53,367
to assassinate your
father's reputation

690
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:56,793
and choose a politician to
support as the next governor.

691
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,164
Hm.

692
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,001
I'm getting ahead of myself.

693
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:10,016
The purpose of this dinner
was to seek a soft landing.

694
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,177
Not to threaten positions.

695
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,824
Let's figure out if we
can even get along first.

696
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,952
Are you hungry?

697
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,266
Not really.

698
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,867
Mm-mm. Me neither.

699
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,303
I've had enough
of this fruity shit.

700
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,706
[deep breath

701
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:36,400
Do you want to go to the bar?

702
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,347
Sure.

703
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,083
Oh, that's not funny.

704
00:50:43,108 --> 00:50:47,019
Then why are you laughing?

705
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,422
I'm laughing because
I'm uncomfortable.

706
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,815
You're uncomfortable
because you find it funny.

707
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,199
I'm dreading arguing
with you in court.

708
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,434
You should. You should.

709
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,128
Yeah?

710
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,233
How the hell are
you still single?

711
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,815
Well...

712
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,153
when you live on a
ranch an hour from town...

713
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:23,523
an hour from anything...

714
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,949
You don't live on
a ranch anymore.

715
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:32,389
Hm. No, I don't.

716
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:39,463
I'm feeling a
little irresponsible.

717
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:42,666
Hm.

718
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:49,615
I'm starting to feel
that way myself, too.

719
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,318
Oh.

720
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,378
Take me somewhere and prove it.

721
00:51:56,181 --> 00:52:00,393
♪ But you know
I've always been ♪

722
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,018
Follow me.

723
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,070
Okay. I don't hear anybody.

724
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:21,206
Wow.

725
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,242
This way.

726
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,987
- You...
- No.

727
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:32,849
This is what I call
a fucking bathroom.

728
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,325
Wait. Wait...

729
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,117
Who cares? Let him listen.

730
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:31,568
What are you doing?

731
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,838
Nothing, baby. Just thinking.

732
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:38,561
Maybe you should think
about something different.

733
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:45,215
I'd love to. But... it
ain't gonna happen.

734
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:47,684
Go back to sleep.

735
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,264
Who is this bitch?

736
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:14,454
Yeah, not her real name.

737
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,545
What a surprise.

738
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:56,829
Our Justice system is in a
state of utter collapse, huh?

739
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,867
And to think of all the hard
work I did to put you in prison.

740
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:05,405
And think of all the hard
work I'm doing to stay out.

741
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:07,139
And I do mean hard.

742
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:10,476
I'll pick you up some
Doxycycline when I'm in town

743
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:13,213
to kill whatever funk your
snatch caught in the clink.

744
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:17,050
Mm. Thanks. Could you
also get me a toothbrush?

745
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:19,585
I hate to keep using yours.

746
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,110
Oh, well. Back to work.

747
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,518
I am not starting
this day sober.

748
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,045
<i>Next time on Yellowstone...</i>

749
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,191
First Duttons
to settle this valley...

750
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,494
fighting was all they knew.

751
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:35,495
She is not gonna help you, Dad.

752
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:38,998
You have invited your worst
enemy to sleep in your bed.

753
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:41,101
Market Equities or its partners.

754
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,268
We can do whatever we want.

755
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,537
They want the land, Dad.

756
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,706
That is all that you
need to understand.

757
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,908
Cowards rule the
world these days, Rip.

758
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,333
I think it's time we showed them
what we do and how we do it.
