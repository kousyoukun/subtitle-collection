1
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:11,779
<i>Previously on Yellowstone...</i>

2
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:15,715
Fished a radio collar out
of the Yellowstone River.

3
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,617
Seen any wolves around lately?

4
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,586
Sounds like poachers.

5
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:21,521
- Sure does.
- Care to ride with us?

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,623
Monica wants
to have a funeral.

7
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,559
She wants him here
where she can visit.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,695
Whatever she wants, you...
You give it, son.

9
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,763
I can't serve both.

10
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,100
I choose her
and I choose my son.

11
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:36,136
You promised and you took
millions in lease payments!

12
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,170
You have no case.

13
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,838
And you know it.

14
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,007
You're better than I expected.

15
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:45,778
I am here just to find
a soft landing.

16
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,448
How busy are you tomorrow night?

17
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,916
New York would like
to drop the suit.

18
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:53,920
Find a way to ruin
this family, Ellis.

19
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,588
Hey, let's go
to a bar in Bozeman.

20
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,191
Yeah, that's a bad
idea every time.

21
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,127
Aren't you a tall
drink of water?

22
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,761
I'm married. Go on.

23
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,231
I'm taking your husband home.

24
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:21,615
What day is it?

25
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,586
Thursday, I think.

26
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,533
What happened to you?

27
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,436
Fucking men.

28
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,406
Worked you over
pretty good, huh?

29
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:49,009
I'm talking about the
cop that arrested me.

30
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,648
Prick is in the club
three nights a week.

31
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,285
He can't cut me a break?

32
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,189
They get you for D.U.I.?

33
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,791
Aggravated assault.

34
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,828
Some bitch from California
tried to fuck my husband

35
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,264
so I beat her with
a beer bottle.

36
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:14,401
So, you're like
a fucking criminal.

37
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:16,103
I am the wrath
of a woman scorned.

38
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,305
Call it what you will.

39
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,209
It's always some
bitch from California.

40
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,277
Every fucking time.

41
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,815
Bethany Dutton.
Let's go.

42
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,484
You don't look like a Bethany.

43
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:35,022
I'm not a Bethany.
I'm a Beth.

44
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:48,935
My hero.

45
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,371
Knock when you're done.

46
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,245
Boy, you have really
fucking done it this time.

47
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:00,280
What's the big deal, Jamie?

48
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,915
I got into
a bar fight in Bozeman.

49
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,751
I mean, Montana Board of Tourism

50
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,486
should put that on
fucking t-shirts.

51
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,488
I don't think the Montana
Board of Tourism

52
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,790
is too fond of locals
beating the shit

53
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,992
out of tourists on vacation.

54
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,861
Well, that's why I called you.

55
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,530
You can find the rug to
sweep this under, right?

56
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,166
There is no rug
for this one, Beth.

57
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,933
It's a County Attorney issue.

58
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,836
So your best bet is to hope this
woman has a plane to catch

59
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,005
or she's too hungover
to come down here

60
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,840
and file formal charges.

61
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,577
This is your legal advice?

62
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:31,911
Sit here and hope?

63
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:37,083
It's not advice.
It's your only option.

64
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,818
If she doesn't file charges,

65
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,887
and that's a big fucking "if"
considering the photo

66
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,890
I saw of the grapefruit
on her forehead,

67
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,293
then I will ask the
County Attorney

68
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:49,329
to show some mercy based on
your diminished capacity

69
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,299
to control your
fucking emotions.

70
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:58,038
So, yeah, you just sit
here and hope.

71
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,644
But no matter what,
if this reaches the press,

72
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:05,645
it's a big embarrassment
for our father.

73
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:06,980
You mean my father.

74
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:11,419
Your father's out of chances to
be embarrassed, isn't he, Jamie?

75
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,355
I'm going to go back to my cell.

76
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,424
I'm going to take a nap.

77
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,393
And you're going to sit on
the fucking steps of this place

78
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,595
and you're going to wait
for Miss California

79
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:27,166
to walk up, and when she does,
you are going to stop her.

80
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,470
How the hell am
I going to do that?

81
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,473
It's not my problem, Jamie.

82
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:12,071
Hey. You got this Dutton
assault case?

83
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,740
Uh, yes, sir.

84
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,843
Why no charges against
the complainant?

85
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,244
It was a bar fight, wasn't it?

86
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,347
It was one hell of
a bar fight from the report.

87
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:23,316
There is no self defense
in a bar fight,

88
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,411
which is to say the victim
is a defendant as well.

89
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:26,719
Is she coming in?

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,990
- I'm waiting for her now.
- I'll wait with you.

91
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,271
You have the Montana
Educators Luncheon at noon.

92
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,306
Cancel it.

93
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,342
Governor, I think that
sends the wrong message.

94
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:53,880
All right, who exactly attends
the Montana Educators Luncheon?

95
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,282
Everyone.
Senator Perry will be there.

96
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,084
Legislators,
School Superintendents,

97
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,552
the President of Montana State.

98
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,388
Why do they call it
the Educators Euncheon

99
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,890
if there's no educators there?

100
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:08,027
It's Thursday, Clara, all
the educators are in school.

101
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,796
Tell you what, when the
Educators' Luncheon

102
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:12,199
is about teachers, I'll go.

103
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,908
Who are they?

104
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,511
It's the policy
advisors' meeting.

105
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,414
Policy advisors for who?

106
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,217
For you.

107
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,622
How can my policy advisors
have a meeting

108
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,390
about policies without me?

109
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,027
Um...

110
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,111
You're in my seat.

111
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:04,451
So what policies are
we discussing today?

112
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:09,557
Nobody?

113
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,893
Let's see...

114
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,564
"In accordance with the
U.S. Green initiative,

115
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:21,568
"Montana is leasing 7,000 acres
in Powder River County

116
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,403
to Sun Energies."

117
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,305
What is Sun Energies?

118
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,408
It's a solar farm company.

119
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,178
Mm. And you are?

120
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,213
Stanley... Roberts.

121
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,048
And you are?

122
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,585
Your chief policy advisor,
Mr. Governor.

123
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,853
Well, nice to fucking meet you.

124
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,122
I tried to schedule
a lunch but you're...

125
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,125
She said you aren't
taking lunches.

126
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,094
Where's your office, Stanley?

127
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,129
Just... Right down the hall.

128
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,431
Know what?
So is mine.

129
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,802
Ever dawn on you just
to come by and say howdy?

130
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,137
My mistake.

131
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,639
I'd say.

132
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,143
Let's see what other
policies I'm proposing.

133
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,779
Suspend natural gas leases
on state land

134
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,648
in Powder River County
to support

135
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,818
the Sage Grouse
Restoration Project.

136
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,626
Um, there's been a precipitous
drop in sage grouse numbers

137
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:21,460
and there is empirical evidence

138
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,696
that gas exploration
and extraction

139
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:27,734
have a negative impact on
the sage grouse environment.

140
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,613
And what effect do you
think seven thousand acres

141
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:32,338
of solar panels are going to
have on their environment?

142
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,374
There's... no evidence that
solar panels

143
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,443
would have any impact on
the sage grouse environment.

144
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,645
What do they do
with the sage brush

145
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,479
when they put
in the solar panels?

146
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,282
They, they...

147
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,818
They would clear it before
putting in the solar panels.

148
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,987
They remove the sage brush.

149
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,256
Yes, sir.

150
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,325
Sage grouse live
in the sage brush.

151
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:54,927
They do.

152
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,063
And you don't think
removing the sage brush

153
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,098
is going to have an effect
on the population?

154
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,600
I just said there's
no evidence...

155
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,971
Know what scares me about
you, Stanley? You're serious.

156
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,007
You're looking at me
and you're not joking.

157
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,642
I think tops on my agenda today

158
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:13,646
is going to be budget
discipline. You're all fired.

159
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,414
I'm very mindful of
our tax payers' money,

160
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,149
and you are all wasting it.

161
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,652
I'll advise myself
on policy, Clara.

162
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,288
How much money did we just save?

163
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,090
I would say...

164
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,859
Roughly 1.6 Million dollars
in salary and benefits

165
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,294
if you're serious.

166
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,963
Oh, I'm pretty serious.

167
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,434
Look at that.

168
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,270
What a great day
for the State of Montana.

169
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,139
Where to next?

170
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,842
We have an emergency meeting
with park officials

171
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,611
and U.S. Fish and Wildlife.

172
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,914
Emergency meeting about what?

173
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,448
Doesn't say.

174
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,950
Usually means someone
died in the park.

175
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,252
They're in your office.

176
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,726
What's the emergency?

177
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:03,362
Governor, we'd like for you
to take a look at this map.

178
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,265
The red lines indicate the
path of a radio-collared wolf

179
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,268
associated with the
Rescue Creek pack.

180
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,737
All right.

181
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:11,871
As you can see...

182
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,572
Wherever we see these clusters,

183
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,742
we associate with a kill site.

184
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:18,544
They'll feed on a carcass for a
few days, then they'll move on.

185
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:22,114
They left the park here
roughly three weeks ago,

186
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,983
they traveled the tree
line to here,

187
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,486
then they dropped down in
this valley to here.

188
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,289
Mm hm.

189
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,491
That's my ranch.

190
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,660
We're aware.

191
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,562
The wolves clustered here
for three days,

192
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,965
around what appears
to be a kill,

193
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:42,335
then they move straight south
for thirty miles to here.

194
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,838
Now, that's the
Yellowstone River...

195
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,141
They jump into the river,
according to this data

196
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,078
and they swim downstream
for five miles.

197
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,481
Wasn't aware wolves
swam down rivers.

198
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,916
They don't.

199
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,986
We recovered one of the radio
collars from the river.

200
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,788
What are you getting at?

201
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:03,790
We think the wolves were
killed on your ranch

202
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,226
and the collars transported
back to the park.

203
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,432
You think my cowboys
killed those wolves.

204
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,036
We think your cowboys
killed those wolves.

205
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,551
<i>Yes sir?</i>

206
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,987
We had any wolves
messing with the cattle?

207
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,389
<i>Wolves? No sir.</i>

208
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,659
<i>Fish and Wildlife came
by asking the same thing.</i>

209
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,728
All right.

210
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,132
There you have it.

211
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,835
Look, if they get
into your cattle

212
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,437
you gotta do what you gotta do.

213
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,374
they shot them
from a distance

214
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,844
didn't notice the collar,

215
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,379
got spooked and tried
to cover their tracks.

216
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,982
These radio collars
aren't monitored by us.

217
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,117
An NGO pays for this research,

218
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,853
and they have
the same data we have

219
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,588
and they are going to draw
the same conclusion.

220
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,858
When they do,

221
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,939
they will come after you
with both barrels, Governor.

222
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,496
Look forward to it.

223
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,731
Anything else?

224
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,434
Thank you, gentlemen.
Governor, we have the...

225
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,871
Yep.

226
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,984
Environmental groups
can be a real problem.

227
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,153
Yeah, you don't say.

228
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,926
This is Clara.

229
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,561
<i>It's Jamie, let me speak to him.</i>

230
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,998
Attorney general.

231
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,699
Yeah?

232
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,634
All right, there is a good
chance I can make this go away.

233
00:13:55,635 --> 00:14:00,372
But, in case I can't,
I need you to know

234
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,608
<i>that I'm in police station
in Bozeman</i>

235
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,443
<i>hoping to convince
a young woman to drop</i>

236
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,979
the aggravated assault
charges she plans

237
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,681
to file against your daughter.

238
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,086
This fucking day.

239
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,356
Can I, uh...

240
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,591
<i>Can I have a little
more context, Jamie?</i>

241
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,328
Yeah, she mouthed
off to Beth in a bar

242
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,264
and it went about
how you'd expect.

243
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,501
<i>All right.
Just, uh, keep me posted.</i>

244
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:35,507
Is there a crisis manager
on my team, by any chance?

245
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:39,445
Well, that would be your press
secretary who you never hired,

246
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,549
so I guess your crisis
manager is me.

247
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,486
Can I have a minute?

248
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,488
<i>Having fun yet?</i>

249
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,490
No chance you'd
want to change jobs?

250
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,126
<i>You'd hate this one more.</i>

251
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,528
Any chance you're in Helena?

252
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,230
<i>A good chance.</i>

253
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,200
- Lunch plans?
<i>- Not anymore.</i>

254
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,402
<i>You know Benny's Bistro?</i>
Sure.

255
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,637
- Noon?
<i>- You made my day.</i>

256
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,176
Yeah, maybe you can make mine.
See you in a bit.

257
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,523
Yes, sir.

258
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,102
Miss Brewer.

259
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,037
I understand you'd
like to press.

260
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,472
Very much.

261
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,113
I feel I must point
out that by doing so,

262
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,748
you are exposing
yourself to prosecution.

263
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,718
How am I doing that?

264
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,521
There is no self defense
claim in a bar fight.

265
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,024
I assume you had been drinking,
and I understand you

266
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:01,260
approached Miss Dutton
and instigated the incident.

267
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:04,563
I didn't instigate anything.

268
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,033
Oh, um...

269
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,435
Let me see.

270
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,104
Yeah, you approached
Miss Dutton and stated,

271
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,041
"I'm taking your husband home.

272
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,508
"You can come with us and watch

273
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,478
or he can tell you
about it tomorrow."

274
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,881
Are those not your words?

275
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,250
I mean...

276
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,053
I was kidding.

277
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,220
Mm.

278
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,057
She didn't find it very funny.

279
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,159
No shit.

280
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:38,197
Making statements or actions
that threaten harm to another

281
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,534
or make them feel
they are in danger is assault.

282
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,270
You don't have to hit
somebody to commit assault,

283
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,072
you just have to
present a threat.

284
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,607
You presented the threat.

285
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,709
So if you press charges

286
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,444
the state must
press charges against you.

287
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,413
And since you are not
a resident of Montana,

288
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:58,217
you present a flight risk
and you bail will be withheld.

289
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,552
Do you understand
what that means?

290
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,389
So she just...

291
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,790
She just gets away with it?

292
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,358
She didn't get away
with anything.

293
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,726
She spent the night in jail
and she's going to be charged

294
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,297
with disorderly conduct.

295
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,300
The choice is yours.

296
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,303
I can't wait to get
out of this state.

297
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,771
Those fucking hillbillies.

298
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,473
Well, the feeling is mutual.

299
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,342
May I leave?

300
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,877
Please.

301
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,452
Saved me a ton of paperwork.

302
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,587
Thanks.

303
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,491
Happy to help.

304
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,004
What're they doing?

305
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,040
For Kayce's boy is my guess.

306
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,934
They told us this spot.

307
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,237
If I would've known I would
have dug that hole for you.

308
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:34,140
We don't mind.
It's part of the ceremony.

309
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,674
There's a dead horse over there.

310
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,875
When did he die?

311
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,344
He died Monday.

312
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,346
I got an excavator coming
out tomorrow to bury him.

313
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,647
We'll bury him now.

314
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,583
We'll put him in the ground
beside the boy.

315
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,619
Can I ask you why?

316
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,557
You can ask,
but I ain't gonna answer.

317
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,525
Kayce's all right
with this, then?

318
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,961
He knows.

319
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,029
Well, you're gonna
need a big hole.

320
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,399
Jake, Ethan,
run back to the barn

321
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,701
and grab us a bunch of shovels.

322
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,604
I'll help you, Mo.

323
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,034
Thank you.

324
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,880
Don't wish for
what you don't want.

325
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,856
You're in it now, John.
You might as well accept it.

326
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,320
All right.

327
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:59,825
Explain this job to me,
because it makes no sense.

328
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:03,595
All I do is go to middle
schools and ribbon cuttings.

329
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,364
Well, when the legislature's
in session

330
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:08,367
you'll be praying
for ribbon cuttings.

331
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:11,470
At the end of the day,
Montana is a business...

332
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:15,006
12,000 employees,
600,000 customers,

333
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,643
and you're the CEO,
and that's all there is.

334
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,077
And you really need to change
your perspective

335
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,146
about these
school meetings, too.

336
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,349
You know, these kids are gonna
remember meeting the governor

337
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,950
for the rest of their lives.

338
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,385
And who knows, you might
even inspire one of them

339
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,053
to become the governor one day.

340
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,521
I mean, that's how
I was inspired.

341
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,890
All right, point taken.

342
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,360
I stepped on a few
land mines it appears.

343
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,927
Already?

344
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,829
Others stepped on them for me.

345
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,834
Seems my daughter
got herself into a bar fight

346
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,437
and has been arrested.

347
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:48,374
I'm sorry.
It's not funny.

348
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,142
I can see how that's funny
to anybody but me.

349
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,179
All right, well, if it doesn't
go away, just ignore it.

350
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,382
You don't comment
on your personal family.

351
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,950
You love your daughter and hope
she learns from her mistakes.

352
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,487
If she's convicted,
what are my...

353
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,888
what are my options?

354
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,090
You have none.

355
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,693
Well, I take that back,
you could pardon her,

356
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:11,863
but that's officially the end
of your political career, so...

357
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,666
I don't have to wait
until the end of my term

358
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,034
to pardon someone?

359
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,703
I would strongly advise it

360
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,439
but no, you have the
authority to pardon,

361
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,641
to commute sentence,
grant clemency,

362
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:24,075
whenever you want.

363
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,744
But once you open that
Pandora's Box,

364
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,547
it does not close, so...

365
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,816
Next land mine?

366
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:34,920
Environmental groups
relating to...

367
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,021
wolves.

368
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,958
- Avoid them at all costs.
- Yeah.

369
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,927
Buffalo and wolves were
the bane of my two terms.

370
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,228
They are kryptonite.

371
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,831
You need to stay away
and try like hell

372
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,433
to avoid taking a position.

373
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:50,702
And you need to get
an environmental advisor.

374
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,805
Not one of your rancher buddies,
an environmentalist.

375
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,708
Someone who understands
the way that they think

376
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:01,179
so they can explain to you what
the hell it is they're thinking.

377
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,181
Here's my best
advice about this job.

378
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,584
Good governors initiate action,

379
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:10,188
and bad governors spend
all their time reacting.

380
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:13,159
There are plenty of things
to clean up besides an airport.

381
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,866
You're the only man I know
who would actually pout

382
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,802
over winning
the election that he entered.

383
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,171
I'm not pouting.

384
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:32,277
Skulking, maybe,
but... not pouting.

385
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:37,116
You know, this is as much
your legacy as that ranch.

386
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,487
You're a smart woman, Lynelle.

387
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,390
Oh, you're just
figuring that out?

388
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:47,193
Just enjoy your lunch, John.
It's on me.

389
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,812
Disorderly conduct?

390
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:08,747
Way to go.

391
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,048
You're welcome.

392
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,350
Now I gotta pick up trash
on the highway

393
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,820
with all my fucking free time.

394
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:20,826
Which car is yours?

395
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:22,505
I can't take you back.
I have to go to Helena.

396
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:25,163
- Which one?
- I'm serious.

397
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,365
Well, how do you want me
to get home, Jamie?

398
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:31,137
Huh? Want me to hike
my skirt up on the on-ramp?

399
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:33,779
I doubt it'd be the first time.

400
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,393
What the fuck is that?

401
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,662
What's what?

402
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,664
The baby seat.
What the fuck is that for?

403
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,732
You have a child?

404
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,139
Do you have a child, Jamie?

405
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,844
A boy.

406
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:23,790
God gave you a boy?

407
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,697
You have my womb
cut out of me...

408
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:34,500
and God gave you a boy?

409
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:43,710
Fuck you!

410
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,047
Beth?

411
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,616
Let me guess, is it
that brood mare

412
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,217
of a fucking campaign manager?

413
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,421
- Yes.
- I saw her coming.

414
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,956
Beth.

415
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:01,226
Come on, Beth.
Beth, stop, stop, stop!

416
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:06,331
Taking you to that clinic is
the greatest regret of my life.

417
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,867
Of all the awful shit
that you have done

418
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,069
in your 45 years on this planet,

419
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,005
Jamie, that is... that is
really saying something.

420
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,207
What...

421
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,177
What did you name him?

422
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,413
He's named after me.

423
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,952
Of course he is!

424
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,386
That's what the world
fucking needs.

425
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,487
Another fucking you.

426
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,157
Beth.

427
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,425
Dad doesn't know about this.
Nobody knows about this.

428
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,328
Don't worry
about me telling him.

429
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,668
I'm gonna take him from you.

430
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:47,072
I'm going to rob you
of fatherhood, Jamie.

431
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,140
You don't deserve it.

432
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,743
And he deserves better than you.

433
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,312
Next time you see him,
you can kiss him goodbye,

434
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:57,850
because he's as good as gone.

435
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,036
Car trouble?

436
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,607
Actually, I just
got out of jail.

437
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,409
And when they let you out,
they just let you out,

438
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,812
there's no, uh,
no phone call to a friend

439
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,480
or a bus ticket.

440
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:38,584
Just, you know, let you
out on the street.

441
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:46,257
Seems an unfair policy
toward one who is clearly

442
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:50,963
having trouble coping
in society, don't you think?

443
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:54,900
Definitely creates, uh...

444
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,602
Additional challenges for sure.

445
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:58,670
Right?

446
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,275
- Do you need a...
- Ride?

447
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,978
I'd love one.

448
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:12,418
Thank you.

449
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,823
What are the odds
that you have a cigarette?

450
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:18,891
Not good.

451
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,462
Well, aren't you cute?

452
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,165
Mom's gonna kill you, Dad.

453
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,100
Is Mom the jealous type?

454
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,303
Mom wears the pants,
if you know what I mean.

455
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:38,010
Sister, I know exactly
what you mean.

456
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:02,634
Stop the car.

457
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,539
Nobody told me.

458
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,243
He didn't tell anybody.

459
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,846
Just pulled up and saw
all the cars.

460
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,219
Should we, uh, get closer?

461
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,823
I think this is as close
as they want us, Dad.

462
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:43,835
So how was jail?

463
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,205
Loud-mouthed pussy.

464
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,706
You and I are going to
have a long talk later.

465
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,308
Yeah, well, I'm going
to sleep later.

466
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,677
We'll have a short one now then.

467
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,981
Impulse control.

468
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:57,984
Find some.

469
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,570
I don't think they want us here.

470
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:23,008
Even if they don't want us,

471
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,876
they need to know
we care enough to stay.

472
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,515
Make me a promise.

473
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:33,218
Don't ever let them
do that to me.

474
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,354
Turn me to ashes
and throw me to the wind.

475
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,290
That's all the care I want.

476
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,158
John.

477
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm not sure the protocol.

478
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:51,696
There's no protocol now.

479
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,099
Ceremony's over.

480
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,368
I wish I'd known.

481
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,705
Grief isn't meant to be shared.

482
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,275
But comfort is.

483
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,411
They could use some now.

484
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:14,586
John...

485
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:19,791
This isn't the place
but we do need to talk.

486
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,393
About what?

487
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,629
About the three hundred jobs
you eliminated

488
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,433
when you canceled
the airport project.

489
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:31,302
A lot of very unhappy
people on the Reservation.

490
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:35,240
Can you meet me at
the Capitol tomorrow?

491
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:38,043
I think you should
meet me on the Reservation.

492
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:40,379
Show the people
you care enough to visit.

493
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:44,883
I can do that.

494
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:10,476
I know how you feel.

495
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:16,047
I wished I didn't, but I do.

496
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:22,253
I buried a son right over there.

497
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,522
I remember.

498
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:29,461
Blaming yourself, aren't you?

499
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,233
Yeah, I did that, too.

500
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,203
Still do some days.

501
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:43,208
I'll tell you something
I've never told anybody.

502
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,376
I had a brother
for about eighteen hours.

503
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,678
His name was Peter.

504
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,215
He was born early,

505
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:53,784
and his little heart
wasn't strong enough.

506
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,853
Not much they
could do back in those days.

507
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,890
Not a lot they can do now.

508
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:03,428
So, they just gave him
back to my mother.

509
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:06,297
The doctors hoped
and we prayed and...

510
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,633
neither worked.

511
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,801
And it changed my mother.
It hardened her.

512
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:14,906
She never... she never tried
to have children again.

513
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:20,077
Years later, I was grown
and Lee had just been born.

514
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:24,249
Both my parents are looking at
him, taking turns holding him.

515
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,051
And my father got white
as a ghost,

516
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:30,255
looked at my mother and said,

517
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:31,923
"Peter lived a perfect life.

518
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,693
"All he saw of this planet
was you

519
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,430
and all he knew
was you loved him."

520
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,968
That boy lived
a perfect life, Monica.

521
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,037
We're the only ones
who know it was brief.

522
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:50,409
All he knew was you
and that you loved him.

523
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,688
Thank you.

524
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,124
Named him after me.

525
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,794
I did.

526
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,332
Means more than
you'll ever know, son.

527
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,001
I know what it means.

528
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,807
Yeah.

529
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,077
Hang on to this.

530
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,512
Even if you don't use it,

531
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:05,351
now is not the time
to stop drawing a paycheck.

532
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,456
I'll find someone
to take your place

533
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,991
if that's what you want.

534
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,095
It's what I want.

535
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,524
Looks like you
got tossed off one.

536
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:49,394
Just been digging graves.

537
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:52,263
Horses go in the field,
you know that.

538
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:54,899
Yeah, I know but they wanted
it beside the boy.

539
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,167
Didn't figure you'd say no.

540
00:38:58,504 --> 00:38:59,738
They say why?

541
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:04,776
My guess is the boy has
something to ride into Heaven.

542
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,814
Uh, the Poison Creek outfit,
they reached out,

543
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,416
they're short handed to brand.

544
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:14,719
They wanted our help so,
if you're all right with it,

545
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
go over there tomorrow.

546
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:18,088
When are we starting?

547
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,624
Well, next week.

548
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,091
You plan on being
here, don't you?

549
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,093
I mean, it's not my place to...

550
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,964
- I'll be here.
- All right.

551
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,470
Park Rangers came and asked me

552
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,473
some question about wolves
that held up here.

553
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:38,509
You know anything about that?

554
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,146
Mm. They pulled down a cow,

555
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:44,815
and I asked Ryan to
go out and shoot 'em.

556
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,885
He shot the ones with
the damn collars on 'em.

557
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:51,556
I was worried that it was going
to cause you a problem

558
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:54,925
so I tried to outsmart 'em
and I guess I didn't.

559
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,227
So, I'm sorry, sir.

560
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,229
Where are the wolves now?

561
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,467
In a place that nobody
will ever find them.

562
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,545
Horses in heaven.

563
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,648
Mm-hm. That's the best
I could figure it.

564
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,053
Wouldn't that be something?

So how many are
y'all running this year?

611
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,596
Bout the same as last year.

612
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:28,766
But we won't add any
yearlings this year though.

613
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,736
Not with diesel prices and corn.

614
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:34,271
- No.
- Shit.

615
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:36,607
When this finally
makes it to the butcher shop,

616
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:38,043
it's gonna sting.

617
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:42,647
It's good to see your boy back.

618
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,550
It's just for the summer.

619
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:51,121
He graduated,
got a job in Boise.

620
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,758
But my daughter wants to stay.

621
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:55,559
We'll see if I can
make a cowboy out of her

622
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,595
shit-for-brains husband.

623
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:00,931
Only thing he seems
to like making is babies.

624
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:02,367
Is that right?

625
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:08,005
World sure is shrinking
where you are.

626
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:10,540
It's good to see that
airport squashed.

627
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,143
That ain't gonna
change nothing, Delbert.

628
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:16,781
I mean, shit, it might
slow it down a bit.

629
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:19,684
At least the world hasn't found
out about this place yet.

630
00:45:21,787 --> 00:45:24,589
It breaks my heart to think
of the world we're leaving them.

631
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,525
Breaks my heart, too.

632
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,996
Hell, I don't even have
any kids.

633
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,723
Higgins.

634
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,272
What took you so long?

635
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:50,041
I've only been Governor a week.

636
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,711
I see you survived.

637
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,614
- Thank you.
- Well, there's a catch.

638
00:46:57,615 --> 00:46:59,383
A catch?

639
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:01,351
Yeah, it's a supervised
release for six months.

640
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,454
Supervised by who?

641
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:05,556
You're looking at him.

642
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:10,327
So, you release me from
prison just to kidnap me?

643
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,730
More or less.
Need your help.

644
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:15,565
With what?

645
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,401
Help me understand you.

646
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:20,470
Help me understand
the way you think.

647
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:22,506
What do I get in return?

648
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:25,109
You just got it.
Get in.

649
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,545
- Where am I staying?
- With me.

650
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:30,347
I'm no political strategist

651
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,716
but granting clemency to a woman
you're shacking up with

652
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:35,452
in the Governor's mansion lends
itself to some negative press.

653
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:36,921
At the ranch.

654
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:39,924
Oh, great. With your bi-polar
sociopathic daughter?

655
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:41,526
She's hardly ever there.

656
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,666
So you know, I just
went a year without sex,

657
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:52,269
which is the longest I've gone
since the first time I had it,

658
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,571
and I'm still not fucking you.

659
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,674
Oh, God.

660
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:00,245
Our relationship will
be purely professional.

661
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:07,585
Let her in.

662
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:28,772
Miss Atwood.

663
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:31,641
Oh, come on. It's Sarah.
Have a seat.

664
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,144
I took the liberty of
ordering us a bottle of Rosé.

665
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:37,114
I hope you don't mind.

666
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:39,984
Well, can't say
I've ever had it.

667
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:42,719
Oh. Well the French,

668
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,256
they drink it
like water in the summer.

669
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,162
Try it.

670
00:48:59,004 --> 00:49:00,305
It's refreshing.

671
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:05,910
It's nice.

672
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:11,882
What?

673
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:16,186
Oh, I'm just trying to decide

674
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:18,522
the best path forward.

675
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,657
How do we manage this?

676
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:23,427
How do we as a company, recover?

677
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,495
How do we save face?

678
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:27,864
But most importantly, how
do we reverse his decision?

679
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:30,667
Either reverse his decision
or get our money back.

680
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:32,836
I mean, the state is facing
a multi-billion dollar lawsuit

681
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:34,338
and you know it.

682
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:36,206
You won't win.

683
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,175
With some of the most
vital elements

684
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:40,710
of your development now in
a Conservation Easement,

685
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:42,247
the argument is moot.

686
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,251
We don't have to win.

687
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:51,055
We just need to keep it in
the news long enough

688
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:53,390
to assassinate your
father's reputation

689
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:56,794
and choose a politician
to support as the next governor.

690
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,165
Hm.

691
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:04,001
I'm getting ahead of myself.

692
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:10,040
The purpose of this dinner
was to seek a soft landing.

693
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,177
Not to threaten positions.

694
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:17,848
Let's figure out if we can
even get along first.

695
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,953
Are you hungry?

696
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,290
Not really.

697
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,891
Mm-mm. Me neither.

698
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:30,327
I've had enough of
this fruity shit.

699
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:36,401
Do you want to go to the bar?

700
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:41,371
Sure.

701
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,107
Oh, that's not funny.

702
00:50:43,108 --> 00:50:47,043
Then why are you laughing?

703
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,446
I'm laughing because
I'm uncomfortable.

704
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,816
You're uncomfortable
because you find it funny.

705
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:59,223
I'm dreading arguing
with you in court.

706
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,458
You should.
You should.

707
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:03,128
Yeah?

708
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,233
How the hell are
you still single?

709
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:15,839
Well...

710
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,177
when you live on
a ranch an hour from town...

711
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:23,547
an hour from anything...

712
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:25,950
You don't live
on a ranch anymore.

713
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,390
Hm. No, I don't.

714
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:39,464
I'm feeling
a little irresponsible.

715
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:42,667
Hm.

716
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:49,639
I'm starting to
feel that way myself, too.

717
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,341
Oh.

718
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,378
Take me somewhere and prove it.

719
00:51:56,181 --> 00:52:00,417
♪ But you know
I've always been ♪

720
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,019
Follow me.

721
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:20,070
Okay.
I don't hear anybody.

722
00:52:20,205 --> 00:52:21,206
Wow.

723
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,243
This way.

724
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,012
- You...
- No.

725
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:32,850
This is what I call
a fucking bathroom.

726
00:53:03,948 --> 00:53:05,349
Wait. Wait...

727
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,118
Who cares?
Let him listen.

728
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,569
What are you doing?

729
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,839
Nothing, baby.
Just thinking.

730
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:38,561
Maybe you should think
about something different.

731
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:45,215
I'd love to.
But... it ain't gonna happen.

732
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:47,685
Go back to sleep.

733
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,265
Who is this bitch?

734
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:14,478
Yeah, not her real name.

735
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:15,546
What a surprise.

736
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:56,853
Our Justice system is in a
state of utter collapse, huh?

737
00:55:56,854 --> 00:56:00,890
And to think of all the hard
work I did to put you in prison.

738
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:05,429
And think of all the hard work
I'm doing to stay out.

739
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,163
And I do mean hard.

740
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:10,500
I'll pick you up some
Doxycycline when I'm in town

741
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:13,236
to kill whatever funk your
snatch caught in the clink.

742
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:17,073
Mm. Thanks. Could you also
get me a toothbrush?

743
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:19,609
I hate to keep using yours.

744
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,111
Oh, well.
Back to work.

745
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,518
I am not starting
this day sober.

746
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:29,046
<i>Next time on Yellowstone...</i>

747
00:57:30,247 --> 00:57:32,215
John: First Duttons
to settle this valley...

748
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:33,517
fighting was all they knew.

749
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:35,519
She is not gonna help you, Dad.

750
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,022
You have invited your worst
enemy to sleep in your bed.

751
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:41,124
Market Equities or its partners.

752
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,292
We can do whatever we want.

753
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,561
They want the land, Dad.

754
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:46,730
That is all that you need
to understand.

755
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,932
Cowards rule the world
these days, Rip.

756
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:51,333
I think it's time we showed them
what we do and how we do it.
