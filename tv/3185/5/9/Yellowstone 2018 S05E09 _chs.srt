5
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,990
在侦探批准之前
{\fs10\b0}We can't have anyone on the inside of the house{\r}

6
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,340
任何人都不能进入房子
{\fs10\b0}until detectives give us approval.{\r}

7
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,100
为什么会有侦探在屋里
{\fs10\b0}Why are there detectives in the house?{\r}

00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,200
你为什么不回答
{\fs10\b0}Why won't you answer?{\r}

11
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,720
这是犯罪现场吗 你是这个意思吗
{\fs10\b0}Is this a crime scene? Is that what you're saying?{\r}

12
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,170
对不起女士 我没有任何信息
{\fs10\b0}I don't have any information, ma'am, I'm sorry.{\r}

13
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,680

14
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,650
对不起

{\fs10\b0}- Kayce. - What do you know?{\r}

18
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,170
我什么都不知道 但我知道他走了
{\fs10\b0}I know nothing. But I know he's gone.{\r}

19
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,100
如果你什么都不知道 怎么会知道这个
{\fs10\b0}Well, if you know nothing, how do you know that?{\r}

20
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,920
我知道 我知道
{\fs10\b0}I know. I know.{\r}

21
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,100

{\fs10\b0}No, no, you fear it. There's a difference. Come on.{\r}

22
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,890
事发现场 给我让开
{\fs10\b0}- The incident scene-- - The fuck out of my way.{\r}

23
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,720
家属正在进入住所
{\fs10\b0}We got family members entering the residence.{\r}

24
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,540
这里
{\fs10\b0}Here.{\r}

25
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,440
凯西
{\fs10\b0}Kayce.{\r}

26
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,300
在哪里
{\fs10\b0}Where?{\r}

27
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,960
你不会想看到的
{\fs10\b0}You don't want to see this.{\r}

28
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,170
让我看看
{\fs10\b0}Show me.{\r}

29
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,720
来吧
{\fs10\b0}Come on.{\r}

30
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,610
什么
{\fs10\b0}What?{\r}

31
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,610
他怎么了
{\fs10\b0}What happened to him?{\r}

32
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,170
我们下楼说
{\fs10\b0}Let's go downstairs.{\r}

33
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,750
嗯
{\fs10\b0}Mm.{\r}

34
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,370
是杰米干的
{\fs10\b0}It was Jamie.{\r}

35
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
不是在这说 我知道是他
{\fs10\b0}- Not here. - I know he did it.{\r}

36
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,480
不
{\fs10\b0}Mm-mmm.{\r}

37
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,370
我见过他这样做
{\fs10\b0}I've seen him do it.{\r}

38
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,270
我们去牧场再谈 把车留在这
{\fs10\b0}We'll talk at the ranch, okay? You leave your car,{\r}

39
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,850
坐我的车
{\fs10\b0}you ride with me.{\r}

40
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,920
好吗
{\fs10\b0}Okay?{\r}

41
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,790
尽管州长办公室尚未发表声明
{\fs10\b0}While no statement has been made from the governor's office{\r}

42
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,580
州警也拒绝置评
{\fs10\b0}and state police refuse to comment,{\r}

43
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,410
但从家属的反应来看
{\fs10\b0}it's clear by the family's reaction{\r}

44
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,440
显然发生了某种悲剧
{\fs10\b0}that some sort of tragedy has taken place.{\r}

45
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,790
回顾一下 州长弹劾听证会第一天
{\fs10\b0}To recap, day one of the governor's impeachment hearing{\r}

46
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,130
原定今晨八点开始
{\fs10\b0}was set to begin at 8:00 this morning.{\r}

47
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,680
但州长没有出席听证会
{\fs10\b0}Now, the governor failed to appear at that hearing.{\r}

48
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,510
现场一名州警报告听到住所内
{\fs10\b0}A state trooper on scene reported hearing a gunshot{\r}

49
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,920
传出枪声
{\fs10\b0}coming from the residence.{\r}

50
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,820
现在已过上午十点
{\fs10\b0}Now it's well past 10:00 a.m.{\r}

51
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,820
虽然我们仍未得到答案
{\fs10\b0}and while we still have no answers,{\r}

52
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,850
但残酷的现实是
{\fs10\b0}the grim reality is that...{\r}

53
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,480
我甚至不愿说出口
{\fs10\b0}I don't even want to say it.{\r}

54
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,960
我们当然希望
{\fs10\b0}We, of course, hope the best{\r}

55
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,920
州长和其家人平安
{\fs10\b0}for the governor and for his family,{\r}

56
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,920
但越来越多迹象表明
{\fs10\b0}but it appears more and more likely{\r}

57
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,790
蒙大拿州第二十六任州长已经去世
{\fs10\b0}that the 26th governor of Montana has died.{\r}

58
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,610
什么事
{\fs10\b0}Yeah?{\r}

59
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,540
我们确定了时间
{\fs10\b0}We have a time.{\r}

60
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,850
好的
{\fs10\b0}Okay.{\r}

61
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,300
凌晨三点五十三分
{\fs10\b0}3:53 a.m.{\r}

62
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,890
三点五十三
{\fs10\b0}3:53.{\r}

63
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,200
正确
{\fs10\b0}Correct.{\r}

64
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,990
我们已确认死因
{\fs10\b0}We have a confirmed COD,{\r}

65
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,680
代号10-56
{\fs10\b0}10-56.{\r}

66
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,270
收到吗 10-56

69
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,340
他们准备好了
{\fs10\b0}They're ready.{\r}

70
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,850
你知道什么
{\fs10\b0}What do you know?{\r}

71
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,130
我做不到 我做不到
{\fs10\b0}I can't-- I can't--{\r}

72
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,920
我说不出口 我说不出来
{\fs10\b0}I can't say it. I can't say it out loud.{\r}

73
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,650
不知怎么 这该死的话就是说不出来
{\fs10\b0}For some reason, I can't get the fucking words to form.{\r}

74
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,170
那就小声说 小声说出来
{\fs10\b0}Wh-Whisper it, then. Whisper it.{\r}

75
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,790
别告诉他们那个
{\fs10\b0}Don't tell them that.{\r}

76
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,230
我不会说的
{\fs10\b0}I won't.{\r}

77
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,370
杰米
{\fs10\b0}Jamie.{\r}

78
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,720
你相信吗
{\fs10\b0}Do you believe it?{\r}

79
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,200
我已经不知道该信什么了
{\fs10\b0}I don't know what to believe anymore.{\r}

80
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,270
作为检察长
{\fs10\b0}I-It is my duty,{\r}

81
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,790

自杀
{\fs10\b0}Suicide?{\r}

94
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,750
杰米不仅杀死了这个人
{\fs10\b0}Not only did Jamie kill the man...{\r}

95
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,440

{\fs10\b0}...he killed everything our father's ever done.{\r}

96
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,100
他所取得的一切
{\fs10\b0}Everything he's achieved.{\r}

97
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,170
他留给我们的一切

{\fs10\b0}He's just killed 'em all.{\r}

100
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,650
我不觉得他会这么做 贝丝

101
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,510
你只是不愿相信
{\fs10\b0}You don't want to think it.{\r}

102
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,820
我知道他能做出什么
{\fs10\b0}I know what he's capable of.{\r}

103
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,030

125
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,270
准备好了吗
{\fs10\b0}Ready?{\r}

126
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,410
我来教你一个小技巧
{\fs10\b0}I'm gonna show you a little trick.{\r}

127
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,580
这样你一下就能知道
{\fs10\b0}It'll let you know right off the bat{\r}

128
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,270
能不能信任一匹马
{\fs10\b0}whether you can trust a horse, okay?{\r}

129
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,340
看到了吗
{\fs10\b0}See this?{\r}

130
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,410
现在你知道可以信任它了吧
{\fs10\b0}Now you know you can trust him?{\r}

131
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,410
我知道它信任我了
{\fs10\b0}Well, now I know he trusts me,{\r}

132
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,750
这也意味着我可以信任它
{\fs10\b0}which means that I can trust him, too.{\r}

133
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,680
你是牛仔吗
{\fs10\b0}You're a cowboy?{\r}

134
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,060
是的
{\fs10\b0}I am.{\r}

135
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,100
我就说牛仔是真实存在的吧
{\fs10\b0}Told you cowboys were real.{\r}

136
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,060
她不相信这世上还有牛仔
{\fs10\b0}She didn't think there was such a thing as cowboys.{\r}

137
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,650
也许将来真的不会有了
{\fs10\b0}Well, there might not be someday.{\r}

138
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,440
好了
{\fs10\b0}There you go.{\r}

139
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,060
她想摸摸马吗
{\fs10\b0}Does she want to pet 'em?{\r}

140
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,990
真的吗
{\fs10\b0}You sure?{\r}

141
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,990
谢谢你  不客气
{\fs10\b0}- Thank you. - Yes, ma'am.{\r}

142
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,440
嘿，我们能和马拍张照吗
{\fs10\b0}Hey, you think we could get a picture with the horses?{\r}

143
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,650
不行
{\fs10\b0}No.{\r}

144
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,750
你刚才让那孩子摸了马
{\fs10\b0}Oh, you just let that kid pet him.{\r}

145
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,270
没错
{\fs10\b0}Yep.{\r}

146
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,480
为什么不让我们摸
{\fs10\b0}Why not us?{\r}

147
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,680
让一次是友好
{\fs10\b0}You do it once, you're being nice.{\r}

148
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,270
让第二次就变成动物园了
{\fs10\b0}You do it a second time, and you're a petting zoo.{\r}

149
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,790
这他妈不是什么动物园
{\fs10\b0}This ain't no fucking petting zoo.{\r}

150
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,170
想摸马就自己去买一匹
{\fs10\b0}You want to pet a horse, go buy one.{\r}

151
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,230
路边起火最常见的原因
{\fs10\b0}Most common way that fires start on a roadway{\r}

152
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,820
是丢弃的烟头
{\fs10\b0}is discarded cigarettes.{\r}

153
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,100
说得对
{\fs10\b0}You don't say.{\r}

154
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,480
这次任务禁止吸烟
{\fs10\b0}There's no smoking on this detail.{\r}

155
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,850
把烟掐了，注意安全
{\fs10\b0}So extinguish that, and do it safely.{\r}

156
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,720
我的硕士学位派上用场了
{\fs10\b0}My master's degree hard at work.{\r}

157
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,230
不准吸烟
{\fs10\b0}No more smoking.{\r}

158
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,680
还剩多少小时
{\fs10\b0}How many hours you got left?{\r}

159
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,790
十八小时
{\fs10\b0}Eighteen.{\r}

160
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,060
今天干完就算结束吧
{\fs10\b0}Let's say we call it even after today.{\r}

161
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
一言为定 伙计
{\fs10\b0}You got a deal, buddy.{\r}

162
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,960
要是路中间起火 我就以纵火罪逮捕你
{\fs10\b0}If the median catches fire, I'm arresting you for arson.{\r}

163
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,060
我会记住的
{\fs10\b0}I'll keep that in mind.{\r}

164
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,890
嘿 亲爱的
{\fs10\b0}Hey, sweetheart.{\r}

165
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,200
德克萨斯怎么样
{\fs10\b0}How's Texas?{\r}

166
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,100
不知道 我们还没到呢
{\fs10\b0}I don't know. We ain't there yet.{\r}

167
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,610
你们已经走了两天了
{\fs10\b0}You've been gone two days.{\r}

168
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,650
是啊 一路走得很慢
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, well, it's been slow rolling.{\r}

169
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,960
要拉着马走
{\fs10\b0}Pulling horses.{\r}

170
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,300
再说 德克萨斯在天涯海角
{\fs10\b0}Besides, Texas-- halfway across the world.{\r}

171
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,990
其实也没那么远 你真可爱
{\fs10\b0}Not really, but it's cute you think it is.{\r}

172
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,440
离你太远了
{\fs10\b0}Well, it's too far from you.{\r}

173
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,440
我知道
{\fs10\b0}I know that.{\r}

174
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,650
我有个好消息
{\fs10\b0}Well, I got some good news.{\r}

175
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,920
我的社区服务提前结束了
{\fs10\b0}I finished my community service early,{\r}

176
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,580
所以
{\fs10\b0}so...{\r}

177
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
我可以去看你了  呃
{\fs10\b0}- I can come visit. - Um...{\r}

178
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,580
让我先看看这边什么情况 好吗
{\fs10\b0}let me see which way is up around here first, okay?{\r}

179
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,440
嘿
{\fs10\b0}Hey.{\r}

180
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,890
我为你坐过牢
{\fs10\b0}I went to jail for you.{\r}

181
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,790
现在还在为你捡垃圾
{\fs10\b0}Now I'm picking up trash for you.{\r}

182
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,610
等我捡完垃圾
{\fs10\b0}When I'm done picking up trash for you{\r}

183
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,580
就飞过去找你 然后我要
{\fs10\b0}I'm gonna fly down there and I'm gonna fuck you{\r}

184
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,030
把你当州博览会奖品一样操
{\fs10\b0}like I won you in the state fair.{\r}

185
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,130
这有什么问题吗
{\fs10\b0}What part of that do you have a problem with?{\r}

186
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,680
是的 每个字都有问题
{\fs10\b0}Yes, every word.{\r}

187
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,610
她就是完美女人
{\fs10\b0}She is the perfect woman.{\r}

188
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,920
亲爱的 我现在和一群牛仔挤在一辆车里
{\fs10\b0}You know, I'm stuffed in a truck with a bunch of cowboys, honey.{\r}

189
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,270
晚点再给你打电话 好吗
{\fs10\b0}Let me call you later tonight, all right?{\r}

190
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,540
我要订机票了
{\fs10\b0}I'm booking a flight.{\r}

191
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,060
别争了
{\fs10\b0}Don't argue.{\r}

192
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,650
牧场为什么不再用这里了
{\fs10\b0}Why doesn't the ranch use this anymore?{\r}

193
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,480
我祖父卖掉了林业用地许可
{\fs10\b0}My grandfather sold the forest service lease,{\r}

194
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,890
这里就和牧场其他地方隔开了
{\fs10\b0}so it's pretty locked off from the rest of the ranch.{\r}

195
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,170
我们以前在这里安排过管理员
{\fs10\b0}We used to have a camp man out here,{\r}

196
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,510
但这边太干燥 不适合放牧
{\fs10\b0}but it's too dry this side to run many cattle,{\r}

197
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,650
而且在高处狼和熊
{\fs10\b0}and wolves and bears are pretty hard on the calves{\r}

198
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,480
会伤害小牛
{\fs10\b0}up high.{\r}

199
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,170
这里离一切都很远
{\fs10\b0}Pretty far from everything out here.{\r}

200
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,680
这正是我最喜欢的地方
{\fs10\b0}That's my favorite thing about it.{\r}

201
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,200
这房间只需要刷点油漆
{\fs10\b0}All this room needs is a little paint.{\r}

202
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,200
有个炉子就更好了
{\fs10\b0}A stove wouldn't hurt.{\r}

203
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,790
对 需要个炉子
{\fs10\b0}And a stove.{\r}

204
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,200
有个冰箱也不错
{\fs10\b0}Fridge would be nice.{\r}

205
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,510
需要一番功夫 但
{\fs10\b0}It'll be work, but...{\r}

206
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,170
什么事不需要呢
{\fs10\b0}what isn't?{\r}

207
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,850
我去楼上看看  好的
{\fs10\b0}- I'm gonna go look upstairs. - Okay.{\r}

208
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,720
你不去看看里面吗
{\fs10\b0}You gonna come check out the inside?{\r}

209
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,030
看什么 她反正要改的
{\fs10\b0}What for? She's just gonna change it.{\r}

210
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,990
希望你攒够了工资
{\fs10\b0}Hope you've been saving those paychecks.{\r}

211
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,440
这是个好兆头
{\fs10\b0}That's a good sign.{\r}

212
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,340
没错
{\fs10\b0}Yep.{\r}

213
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,030
结果如何
{\fs10\b0}Well, what's the verdict?{\r}

214
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,960
你是说我们有表决权吗
{\fs10\b0}You mean we get a vote?{\r}

215
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,920
对 你们当然有表决权
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, of course you get a vote.{\r}

216
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,300
只是她的意见最重要
{\fs10\b0}Hers is the only one that matters,{\r}

217
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,510
但我们也能投票
{\fs10\b0}but we still get one.{\r}

218
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,820
嘿
{\fs10\b0}Hey.{\r}

219
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,410
我很喜欢这里
{\fs10\b0}I love it.{\r}

220
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,960
我也很喜欢
{\fs10\b0}I love it here, too.{\r}

221
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,790
你觉得呢 宝贝
{\fs10\b0}What do you think, baby?{\r}

222
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,610
我觉得这就是我们该在的地方
{\fs10\b0}Think it's where we're supposed to be.{\r}

223
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,200
妈 太恶心了
{\fs10\b0}Mom, gross.{\r}

224
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,850
别用舌头
{\fs10\b0}Stop using your tongue.{\r}

225
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,370
这里还有小孩呢
{\fs10\b0}There's a child present.{\r}

226
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,890
儿子 你都有驾照了
{\fs10\b0}You got a driver's license, son.{\r}

227
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,680
是时候了解这些事了
{\fs10\b0}It's time you learn about these things.{\r}

228
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,060
是啊 但是

抱歉

{\fs10\b0}location beacons.{\r}

245
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,720
会面结束后 我会把这些东西还给你
{\fs10\b0}After the meeting, I'll return these things to you.{\r}

246
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,750
好吧
{\fs10\b0}Sure.{\r}

247
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,340
下午好 莎拉
{\fs10\b0}Good afternoon, Sarah.{\r}

248
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,130
很高兴见到你 我叫格兰特
{\fs10\b0}Pleasure to meet you. My name's Grant.{\r}

249
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,610
我很怀疑这点
{\fs10\b0}I highly doubt that.{\r}

250
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,440
不过你就叫我格兰特吧
{\fs10\b0}Well, it's Grant to you.{\r}

251
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,370
这是我们从蒙大拿州总检察长家中
{\fs10\b0}This is from surveillance video we obtained from the home{\r}

252
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,480
获取的监控录像
{\fs10\b0}of the Montana attorney general.{\r}

253
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,300
你们什么时候在他家装的窃听器
{\fs10\b0}When did you bug his house?{\r}

254
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,960
在接受任何委托前
{\fs10\b0}Before we take on any assignment,{\r}

255
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,680
我们都会采取防范措施
{\fs10\b0}we make certain to protect ourselves{\r}

256
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,990
以防委托人失去决心或自制
{\fs10\b0}from the client's lack of resolve or discipline.{\r}

257
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,170
这显然让总检察长
{\fs10\b0}It obviously creates a conflict{\r}

258
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,820
陷入利益冲突
{\fs10\b0}for the attorney general,{\r}

259
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,540
他与代表公司的律师
{\fs10\b0}having a sexual relationship{\r}

260
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,680
保持着不正当关系 而这家公司正在起诉该州
{\fs10\b0}with counsel for the company that is both suing the state,{\r}

261
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,340
同时也是弹劾案的最大受益方
{\fs10\b0}as well as the greatest beneficiary of this impeachment.{\r}

262
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,200
要看完整段视频吗
{\fs10\b0}Should we watch the whole thing?{\r}

263
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,720
我说明白了吗
{\fs10\b0}Have I proved my point?{\r}

264
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,200
如果有任何消息泄露
{\fs10\b0}If anything leaks{\r}

265
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,170
或证据指向我们
{\fs10\b0}or evidence leads back to us in any way,{\r}

266
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,170
你会让它看起来像我们犯下了谋杀
{\fs10\b0}you will make it look as if we committed the murder.{\r}

267
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,750
你就是在谋杀
{\fs10\b0}You are committing the murder.{\r}

268
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,680
你出现在这里就是在谋杀
{\fs10\b0}Your presence here is committing the murder.{\r}

269
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,890
我们只是为你们无力解决的冲突
{\fs10\b0}And we provide logistical solutions{\r}

270
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,610
提供后勤解决方案
{\fs10\b0}to conflicts you do not have{\r}

271
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,410
砍倒树的不是斧头
{\fs10\b0}the capacity to resolve on your own.{\r}

272
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,920
而是想要砍树的人
{\fs10\b0}It's not the axe that chops the tree,{\r}

273
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,230
不管是亲自动手
{\fs10\b0}it's the man who desires the tree to be chopped.{\r}

274
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,410
还是雇人去做
{\fs10\b0}And whether that man chops it himself{\r}

275
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,170
结果都是一样的
{\fs10\b0}or hires others,{\r}

276
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,790
一切源于一个人的欲望
{\fs10\b0}the result is the same.{\r}

277
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,680
你有这个欲望
{\fs10\b0}And it all begins with one person's desire.{\r}

278
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,370
你有办法
{\fs10\b0}You have a desire.{\r}

279
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,060
解决我们无力应对的
{\fs10\b0}Do you have a logistical solution{\r}

280
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,580
这个冲突吗
{\fs10\b0}for the conflict that we lack{\r}

281
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,370
我们认为有
{\fs10\b0}the ability to resolve?{\r}

282
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,270
愿意分享吗
{\fs10\b0}We think we do.{\r}

283
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,580
你想知道细节吗
{\fs10\b0}Do you care to share?{\r}

284
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,650
通常来说
{\fs10\b0}Typically,{\r}

285
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,410
知道得越少越好
{\fs10\b0}the less you know, the better.{\r}

286
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,170
但在这个案例中
{\fs10\b0}Uh, in this case, however,{\r}

287
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,440
你需要在事后扮演一定角色
{\fs10\b0}you'll have a role in how this goes, postmortem.{\r}

288
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,230
好吧
{\fs10\b0}Okay.{\r}

289
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,790
查看他的档案
{\fs10\b0}Now, looking over his file,{\r}

290
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,060
似乎达顿先生得罪了
{\fs10\b0}it seems Mr. Dutton has amassed a fairly{\r}

291
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,650
不少与你怀有相同想法的人
{\fs10\b0}long list of individuals who likely share your desire.{\r}

292
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,200
然而
{\fs10\b0}However,{\r}

293
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,750
若暗示是其他人所为
{\fs10\b0}there's too many variables{\r}

294
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,890
变数太多
{\fs10\b0}in hinting this was done by another player,{\r}

295
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,540
所以我们认为自杀是最干净的方式
{\fs10\b0}so we think suicide is the cleanest.{\r}

296
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,060
自杀
{\fs10\b0}Suicide.{\r}

297
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,440
约翰·达顿绝不是轻言放弃的人
{\fs10\b0}John Dutton is the opposite of a quitter,{\r}

298
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,300
他没有心理健康问题
{\fs10\b0}and he has no history of mental health issues,{\r}

299
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,230
也没有药物或酒精滥用史
{\fs10\b0}no history of drug or alcohol abuse.{\r}

300
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,820
这些我们都会安排
{\fs10\b0}We take care of all that.{\r}

301
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,100
会留下所有能证明
{\fs10\b0}Okay, there'll be all the physical evidence present{\r}

302
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,990
精神状态不稳定的物证
{\fs10\b0}to support an erratic mental state.{\r}

303
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,580
不能伪装成心脏病发作吗
{\fs10\b0}Can't you just mimic, like, a heart attack?{\r}

304
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,370
可以
{\fs10\b0}We could.{\r}

305
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,990
但那样就要依赖法医
{\fs10\b0}And now we're relying on a medical examiner{\r}

306
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,300
进行尸检和毒理分析
{\fs10\b0}to do an autopsy, a toxicology.{\r}

307
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,650
有太多风险会
{\fs10\b0}There's just too many risks of{\r}

308
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,340
发现致死物质
{\fs10\b0}the triggering agent being discovered.{\r}

309
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,960
在这种情况下 自杀方案
{\fs10\b0}Suicide offers the highest reward{\r}

310
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,510
收益最高 风险最低
{\fs10\b0}and the lowest risk in this circumstance.{\r}

311
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,650
实际上在大多数情况下 这都是我们
{\fs10\b0}And in most circumstances, actually, it's, uh...{\r}

312
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,200
最偏好的布置现场方式
{\fs10\b0}it's our preferred staging of a scene.{\r}

313
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,920
好吧
{\fs10\b0}Okay.{\r}

314
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,030
看来你的转账已经完成
{\fs10\b0}Well, it seems your wire's cleared.{\r}

315
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,130
现在我只需要你的
{\fs10\b0}Only thing I need from you is...{\r}

316
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,170
执行许可
{\fs10\b0}permission to execute.{\r}

317
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,440
你得说出来
{\fs10\b0}You'll need to say it.{\r}

318
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,650
我允许你执行
{\fs10\b0}You have my permission to execute.{\r}

319
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,060
嘿 兄弟 我们快到大门了
{\fs10\b0}Hey, bud, we're about to pull through the gate.{\r}

320
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,510
你想让我们去哪
{\fs10\b0}Where do you want us?{\r}

321
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,850
我不在那 我在韦瑟福德
{\fs10\b0}Look, I ain't there, man. I'm in Weatherford.{\r}

322
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,440
我们正准备比赛
{\fs10\b0}We're getting ready for this derby.{\r}

323
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,170
但我安排好了 科里·庞兹在那里
{\fs10\b0}But I got you covered. Kory Pounds is there.{\r}

324
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,890
从总部往右绕
{\fs10\b0}Just head past the headquarters around to the right{\r}

325
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,510
直到看见牛群和一群
{\fs10\b0}till you run into cows and a whole{\r}

326
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,230
牛仔就行了 好吧
{\fs10\b0}- pile of cowboys, all right? - All right.{\r}

327
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,440
好的 伙计 再联系
{\fs10\b0}All right, partner, we'll talk to you.{\r}

328
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,170
科里 你把阿肯色人带来了
{\fs10\b0}- Say, Kory. - You brought Arkansas with you.{\r}

329
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,820
我他妈不是阿肯色人
{\fs10\b0}I ain't from fucking Arkansas.{\r}

330
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,990
你该少跟特拉维斯混在一起
{\fs10\b0}You need to stop hanging out with Travis.{\r}

331
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,170
见鬼 这里的空气真浓
{\fs10\b0}Goddamn, the air is thick down here.{\r}

332
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,990
是啊 我们管这叫氧气
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, we like to call it oxygen.{\r}

333
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,790
我们不在山区了 老牛仔
{\fs10\b0}We're not in the mountains anymore, old cowboy.{\r}

334
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,540
你们留着氧气 我们留着雨水
{\fs10\b0}Well, you can keep your oxygen and we'll keep our rain.{\r}

335
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,680
没听说过
{\fs10\b0}Never heard of it.{\r}

336
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,720
哦 就是从天上
{\fs10\b0}Oh, it's water that falls{\r}

337
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,130
落下的水 科里
{\fs10\b0}from the sky, Kory.{\r}

338
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,790
你现在完全在胡说八道了
{\fs10\b0}Well, now you're just making shit up.{\r}

339
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,200
我真遗憾我们得在出发前
{\fs10\b0}Look, I hate that we had to send 'em down here{\r}

340
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,270
把它们送到这里
{\fs10\b0}before we hit the road.{\r}

341
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,100
我们都是干这个谋生的
{\fs10\b0}Look, we all do it for a living.{\r}

342
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
你的牧场在
{\fs10\b0}I've got your pastures{\r}

343
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,920
南边
{\fs10\b0}- to the south. - Okay.{\r}

344
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,340
我得说 你会厌倦那些帐篷的
{\fs10\b0}I will say you're gonna get real tired of those teepees.{\r}

345
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,580
这里十英里内就有汽车旅馆
{\fs10\b0}There's motels not ten miles from here.{\r}

346
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,100
不 露营是免费的
{\fs10\b0}No, the ground is free.{\r}

347
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,650
我们想尽可能节省开支
{\fs10\b0}We're trying to cut every corner we can.{\r}

348
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,820
这里二十英里的风速
{\fs10\b0}Well, a 20-mile-an-hour wind{\r}

349
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,370
意味着没有风
{\fs10\b0}means the wind isn't blowing here.{\r}

350
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,790
我只是想让你知道我提醒过你
{\fs10\b0}I just want you to know I warned you.{\r}

351
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,820
他们给你配了不错的马具 是吧
{\fs10\b0}They got you pretty damn good mounting on them, don't they?{\r}

352
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,230
生命太短暂 不该骑差马
{\fs10\b0}Well, life's too short to ride bad horses.{\r}

353
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,990
说得对 开始干活吧
{\fs10\b0}Yes, sir. Let's go to work.{\r}

354
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,990
喔 宝贝
{\fs10\b0}Ho, mama!{\r}

355
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,480
驾 驾
{\fs10\b0}Hup, hup!{\r}

356
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,370
特拉维斯给你放假了
{\fs10\b0}Travis give you the day off?{\r}

357
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,270
严格来说 他解雇了我 但是
{\fs10\b0}Well, technically, he fired me, but...{\r}

358
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,060
他每周都要开除我几次 所以
{\fs10\b0}fires me a couple of times a week, so...{\r}

359
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,170
事实上 他让我转告你
{\fs10\b0}Actually, h-he told me to tell you{\r}

360
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,410
去你的
{\fs10\b0}to go fuck yourself.{\r}

361
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,920
你告诉那个混蛋
{\fs10\b0}Well, you tell that son of a bitch{\r}

362
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,300
谢谢他带来了团队
{\fs10\b0}thanks for bringing the crew.{\r}

363
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,820
好的 见到你真好 吉米
{\fs10\b0}- Yeah. - It's good seeing you, Jimmy.{\r}

364
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,850
见到您也很高兴 先生
{\fs10\b0}Good to see you, sir.{\r}

365
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,540
看看是谁来了 这牧场肯定有那种
{\fs10\b0}Look who it is. This ranch must have one of those{\r}

366
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,920
残疾人就业计划
{\fs10\b0}"hire the handicapped" programs.{\r}

367
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,030
不能这么说 杰克 应该说
{\fs10\b0}Can't say that, Jake. Gotta say something like{\r}

368
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,410
为残障人士提供就业机会
{\fs10\b0}"employment for the disabled."{\r}

369
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,170
如果是智力障碍呢
{\fs10\b0}What if it's a mental disability?{\r}

370
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,890
不是障碍 是挑战
{\fs10\b0}Not a disability. It's a challenge.{\r}

371
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,920
智力受限
{\fs10\b0}Mentally challenged.{\r}

372
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,060
这倒是挺符合他的情况
{\fs10\b0}And that is a pretty fair description of him.{\r}

373
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,100
但如果他是蠢货 我们还能叫他蠢货
{\fs10\b0}But if he's stupid, hell, we can still call him stupid.{\r}

374
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,370
可以 只要是直接说吉米
{\fs10\b0}You can, as long as you apply it directly to Jimmy.{\r}

375
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,410
说别人就要小心了
{\fs10\b0}Anyone else and you're getting into some stormy waters.{\r}

376
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,270
你们两个蠢货能闭嘴吗
{\fs10\b0}Would you two stupid motherfuckers shut up?{\r}

377
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,060
你们真是丢人现眼
{\fs10\b0}Y'all are fucking embarrassing yourselves.{\r}

378
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,610
我们丢人现眼
{\fs10\b0}- We're embarrassing ourselves? - Yes.{\r}

379
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,030
有空录下你的声音
{\fs10\b0}Okay, record your voice one day{\r}

380
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,990
听听是什么样子
{\fs10\b0}and then listen back to it.{\r}

381
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,540
等着听我唱歌吧
{\fs10\b0}Wait till you hear me sing.{\r}

382
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,960
你们可以用那些围栏安置马匹
{\fs10\b0}You can use those pens for your horses.{\r}

383
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,510
我去拿些干草来
{\fs10\b0}I'll bring some hay up.{\r}

384
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,230
听着，我要你记录下
{\fs10\b0}Listen, I want you to keep track of everything{\r}

385
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,510
我们用的所有东西，然后向我收费
{\fs10\b0}that we use, and you charge me for it.{\r}

386
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,410
一点干草算不了什么
{\fs10\b0}I think we can spare a little hay.{\r}

387
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,850
这不是业余爱好，达斯蒂
{\fs10\b0}Nah, this ain't nobody's hobby, Dusty.{\r}

388
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,410
你该向我们收费
{\fs10\b0}You can charge us.{\r}

389
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,540
工棚随时可用
{\fs10\b0}The bunkhouse is open.{\r}

390
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,440
你们很快就会厌倦帐篷的
{\fs10\b0}Y'all are gonna get real tired of those teepees.{\r}

391
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,920
我们没问题
{\fs10\b0}We'll be good.{\r}

392
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
我建议你接受工棚的提议
{\fs10\b0}I'd take him up on that bunkhouse.{\r}

393
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,990
不了，我要和牛群待在一起，科里
{\fs10\b0}Nah, I'll stay with the herd, Kory.{\r}

394
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,030
这里还有什么需要我担心的吗
{\fs10\b0}So, is there anything else I need to worry about out here?{\r}

395
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,060
火灾 那蛇呢
{\fs10\b0}- Fire. - What about snakes?{\r}

396
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,850
蛇会让你害怕
{\fs10\b0}Well, snakes'll worry the shit out of you,{\r}

397
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,920
但它们不会伤害你的牛
{\fs10\b0}but they won't mess with your cattle.{\r}

398
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,750
你离韦瑟福德真远啊
{\fs10\b0}You're a long way from Weatherford.{\r}

399
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,750
特拉维斯要帮忙，我们就来了
{\fs10\b0}Well, when Travis asks for a favor, we go do 'em.{\r}

400
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,270
帮我个忙，替我谢谢他们好吗
{\fs10\b0}Well, you do me a favor-- tell them thank you for me, will you?{\r}

401
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,680
好的，先生
{\fs10\b0}Yes, sir, I will.{\r}

402
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,610
我看他们没把你的拖车拉来
{\fs10\b0}They didn't bring your trailer up here, I see.{\r}

403
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,440
这辆还能再用一阵
{\fs10\b0}Well, there's still some silly to run out of this one.{\r}

404
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,610
要是他回来时没带上我，就赶紧来救我
{\fs10\b0}If he comes back without me, come a-running.{\r}

405
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,480
那边有只蜻蜓，跟我的头一样大
{\fs10\b0}Saw a dragonfly out there about as big as my fucking head.{\r}

406
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,230
是啊，它们很大
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, they're pretty big.{\r}

407
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,170
这里的人说"大得能站着上火鸡"
{\fs10\b0}They say out here "big enough to fuck a turkey flat-footed."{\r}

408
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,270
等等，这是什么意思
{\fs10\b0}Wait, what does that mean?{\r}

409
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,960
吉米，你要错过搭车机会了
{\fs10\b0}Jimmy. You're missing your ride.{\r}

410
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,410
不，先生，我是和科里庞兹一起来的
{\fs10\b0}Oh, no, sir. I came with Kory Pounds.{\r}

411
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,680
放屁，你的车要走了
{\fs10\b0}No shit. Your ride is leaving.{\r}

412
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,580
天啊
{\fs10\b0}- Oh, f... - God's sakes.{\r}

413
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,960
该死
{\fs10\b0}Fuck.{\r}

414
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,960
快点动起来
{\fs10\b0}Sprinkle some ándale on it.{\r}

415
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,480
他跑得还不错
{\fs10\b0}- Oh, he's doing okay. - Hope you can haul ass.{\r}

416
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,100
真见鬼
{\fs10\b0}Oh, shit.{\r}

417
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,580
孩子们长大得真快
{\fs10\b0}They grow up so fast.{\r}

418
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,060
要珍惜他们年轻的时光
{\fs10\b0}You got to cherish the moments when they're young.{\r}

419
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,650
记录每个重要时刻，多拍些照片
{\fs10\b0}Capture every milestone. Lots of pictures.{\r}

420
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,850
你们真娘炮
{\fs10\b0}Y'all are so gay.{\r}

421
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,510
现在不能这么说了，T
{\fs10\b0}Oh, you can't say that anymore, T.{\r}

422
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,890
去他的，我就要说
{\fs10\b0}No, fuck I can't.{\r}

423
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,540
就是，要是有个gay在这
{\fs10\b0}Hell, if a gay man was standing here,{\r}

424
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,030
他也会说你们很娘
{\fs10\b0}he'd tell you how gay y'all are.{\r}

425
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,030
就算是圣莫尼卡那边
{\fs10\b0}If a gay hairdresser from fucking Santa Monica{\r}

426
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,850
抱着吉娃娃的gay发型师
{\fs10\b0}was standing here holding a fucking Chihuahua,{\r}

427
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,850
也会说你们是他见过最娘的人
{\fs10\b0}he'd tell you you're the gayest motherfuckers he's ever met.{\r}

428
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,580
提特
{\fs10\b0}Teeter?{\r}

429
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,720
什么事，先生
{\fs10\b0}Yes, sir?{\r}

430
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,130
我们来玩个游戏
{\fs10\b0}We're gonna play a little game.{\r}

431
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,540
叫做一周之内
{\fs10\b0}It's called no one talks{\r}

432
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,030
谁都不准说话
{\fs10\b0}for a week.{\r}

433
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,340
多有趣啊
{\fs10\b0}Won't that be fun?{\r}

434
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,510
是，先生
{\fs10\b0}Y-Yes, sir.{\r}

435
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,270
一个字都不准说
{\fs10\b0}Not a fucking word.{\r}

436
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,920
杰克，沃克，把拖车解开
{\fs10\b0}Jake, Walker, unhook that trailer.{\r}

437
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,170
清单拿来了吗
{\fs10\b0}You got that list?{\r}

438
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,340
这风太大，火势不好控制
{\fs10\b0}Can't trust fire out here in this wind.{\r}

439
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,340
冷藏箱里的牛排也不保险
{\fs10\b0}I don't trust steaks in those coolers, either.{\r}

440
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,170
是啊，昨晚都85度了
{\fs10\b0}- Yeah. - 85 degrees just last night.{\r}

441
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,440
盖特，凡士林是用来干什么的
{\fs10\b0}What's the Vaseline for, Gator?{\r}

442
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,580
这里太寂寞了
{\fs10\b0}It's lonely up here.{\r}

443
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,170
都准备好了吗，杰克 是的，先生
{\fs10\b0}- We good, Jake? - Yes, sir.{\r}

444
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,170
帐篷不会自己搭起来
{\fs10\b0}Them teepees ain't gonna set up themselves.{\r}

445
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,750
确实不会
{\fs10\b0}No, they ain't.{\r}

446
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,060
伙计们，想想看
{\fs10\b0}Y'all think about this, boys.{\r}

447
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,850
夸纳帕克就从这里骑马经过
{\fs10\b0}Quanah Parker rode right through here.{\r}

448
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,270
就是这个地方
{\fs10\b0}I mean, right here.{\r}

449
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,820
他穿过帕洛杜拉峡谷
{\fs10\b0}He dropped down the Palo Dura Canyon,{\r}

450
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,720
来到亚诺埃斯塔卡多
{\fs10\b0}come up the Llano Estacado.{\r}

451
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,820
骑兵们都被他绕得团团转
{\fs10\b0}Be the damn cavalry running in circles.{\r}

452
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,820
这里的先驱们肯定也迷失了方向
{\fs10\b0}Hell, I bet those pioneers out here got lost in circles.{\r}

453
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,750
要么渴死，要么就疯了
{\fs10\b0}'Cause they'd have died of thirst or just went mad.{\r}

454
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,200
落基山脉或许很残酷
{\fs10\b0}Them Rocky Mountains may be cruel.{\r}

455
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,790
但这片土地根本不在乎你的死活
{\fs10\b0}This land don't care enough about you to be cruel.{\r}

456
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,650
它只会让你消失
{\fs10\b0}It'd just forget you.{\r}

457
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,750
直到你彻底被遗忘
{\fs10\b0}Forget you till you disappear.{\r}

458
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,170
他们是怎么在湖下铺设管道的
{\fs10\b0}How do they run a pipeline under the lake?{\r}

459
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,410
大概是在下面钻孔吧
{\fs10\b0}Drill under it somehow, I guess.{\r}

460
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,410
不知道它们多久会爆炸一次
{\fs10\b0}I wonder how often they burst.{\r}

461
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,540
2016年阿拉巴马就有一次大爆炸
{\fs10\b0}Big one blew in Alabama in 2016.{\r}

462
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,720
加州也发生过几次
{\fs10\b0}Been a couple in California.{\r}

463
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,100
今年拉斯维加斯早些时候也有一次
{\fs10\b0}One burst earlier in Las Vegas this year.{\r}

464
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,440
这些都是他们藏不住的
{\fs10\b0}I know about the ones they can't hide.{\r}

465
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,750
我在想那些能藏住的
{\fs10\b0}Just wondering about the ones they can.{\r}

466
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,230
如果他们的管道在这里爆炸
{\fs10\b0}If their pipeline explodes on us,{\r}

467
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,060
污染了我们的水源，谁会知道
{\fs10\b0}poisons our water, who will know?{\r}

468
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,990
谁来告诉世界 我们来告诉世界
{\fs10\b0}- Who tells the world? - We tell the world.{\r}

469
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,850
世界不会听我们的，莫
{\fs10\b0}World doesn't listen to us, Mo.{\r}

470
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,650
这就是
{\fs10\b0}This...{\r}

471
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,230
我们誓死守护的阵地
{\fs10\b0}is the hill we die on.{\r}

472
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,030
就在这里
{\fs10\b0}Right here.{\r}

473
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,170
我准备好了
{\fs10\b0}I'm ready.{\r}

474
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,580
看起来很暴躁
{\fs10\b0}Seems pretty mad.{\r}

475
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,990
这混蛋该阉了
{\fs10\b0}This son of a bitch needs to lose his balls.{\r}

476
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,060
坏脾气的小马长大会成为烈马
{\fs10\b0}Bad colt makes a mean stallion.{\r}

477
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,540
儿子，盯紧这匹马
{\fs10\b0}Keep your eyes on this one, son.{\r}

478
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,060
你觉得他们到德克萨斯了吗
{\fs10\b0}You think they made it to Texas yet?{\r}

479
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,850
肯定到了
{\fs10\b0}Oh, yeah, they made it.{\r}

480
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,270
没有牛群需要看管
{\fs10\b0}What are we supposed to do{\r}

481
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,790
我们该干什么
{\fs10\b0}without any cattle to look after?{\r}

482
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,720
训练这些小马
{\fs10\b0}Just work these young ones.{\r}

483
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,510
你可以跟我们去修围栏
{\fs10\b0}You can come work the fence with us.{\r}

484
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,130
我觉得我还是帮劳埃德训马吧
{\fs10\b0}Uh, I think I'd rather help Lloyd with the colts.{\r}

485
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,440
这不是在征求你的意见
{\fs10\b0}Oh, you thought that was a question.{\r}

486
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,100
上车
{\fs10\b0}Get your ass in the truck.{\r}

487
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,100
今天你要去修围栏
{\fs10\b0}You're working fences today.{\r}

488
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,720
现在有活干了吧，小子
{\fs10\b0}You got something to do now, ain't you, pup?{\r}

489
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,480
就不该多嘴
{\fs10\b0}Shouldn't have opened my big mouth.{\r}

490
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,920
河东边还有一些母牛和小牛
{\fs10\b0}You know, we still got pairs east of the river.{\r}

491
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,130
是啊，十月再把它们赶下来
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, we'll bring 'em down in October.{\r}

492
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,300
这小子说得对
{\fs10\b0}Boy's right.{\r}

493
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,790
这里确实没什么活要干
{\fs10\b0}Really ain't much for us to do,{\r}

494
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,820
而南边他们正忙得不可开交
{\fs10\b0}and they got their hands full down south.{\r}

495
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,990
不是我能决定牛仔该去哪
{\fs10\b0}It ain't up to me to decide where cowboys go.{\r}

496
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,960
嘿，德州人生活怎么样
{\fs10\b0}Hey, how's life as a Texican?{\r}

497
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,820
风很大
{\fs10\b0}- Oh, it's windy. - Well, there ain't no trees{\r}

498
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,510
那边没有树挡风
{\fs10\b0}or anything to block the wind down there.{\r}

499
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,130
你要是路过潘帕
{\fs10\b0}You get through Pampa,{\r}

500
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,960
帮我取一个27号克拉珀钻头
{\fs10\b0}I got a Klapper 27 bit needs picked up there.{\r}

501
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,790
我正在潘帕，我去取
{\fs10\b0}Well, I'm in Pampa. I'll pick it up.{\r}

502
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,300
家里一切都好吗
{\fs10\b0}How's everything at home?{\r}

503
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,060
很安静
{\fs10\b0}Eh, quiet.{\r}

504
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,920
男孩们已经觉得无聊了
{\fs10\b0}Boys are already bored.{\r}

505
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,850
有的是活要干
{\fs10\b0}Well, there's plenty of work to be done.{\r}

506
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,820
是啊，但不是牛仔的活
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, not much cowboy work, though.{\r}

507
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
我估计这个转盘
{\fs10\b0}I expect this whorl{\r}

508
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,750
会刷上新漆
{\fs10\b0}to get a new coat of paint{\r}

509
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,650
所有马具都会被擦得锃亮
{\fs10\b0}and all the tack'll be clean and shiny{\r}

510
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,850
等你们回来的时候
{\fs10\b0}by the time y'all get back.{\r}

511
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,610
我可以再给你派几个人去
{\fs10\b0}You know, I could send you a couple more guys.{\r}

512
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,440
两个牛仔就够了
{\fs10\b0}Two cowboys can run this here.{\r}

513
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,170
不，我需要人手在那里，防止狼群来袭
{\fs10\b0}No, I need people there. Keep the wolves away.{\r}

514
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,100
我们这儿没见过狼
{\fs10\b0}We ain't been seeing no wolves.{\r}

515
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,820
我说的是两条腿的那种
{\fs10\b0}Talking about the two-legged kind.{\r}

516
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,300
我妻子一个人在大房子里
{\fs10\b0}My wife's in the big house all alone.{\r}

517
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,230
是啊，我们会把大门锁好
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, well, we're keeping the gate locked{\r}

518
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,680
灯也会一直开着，老板
{\fs10\b0}and the lights on, boss.{\r}

519
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,920
谢了，兄弟
{\fs10\b0}Well, I appreciate it, bud.{\r}

520
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:10,170
我去取你那份，再见
{\fs10\b0}I'll pick your bit up. Bye.{\r}

521
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,200
下午好
{\fs10\b0}Afternoon.{\r}

522
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,440
不接新订单了 - 我是来
{\fs10\b0}- Not taking any more orders. - I'm here{\r}

523
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,790
取劳埃德·布里杰的27号订单的
{\fs10\b0}to pick up a 27 for Lloyd Bridger.{\r}

524
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,370
蒙大拿牛仔？
{\fs10\b0}Montana cowboy?{\r}

525
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,410
嗯
{\fs10\b0}Hm.{\r}

526
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,060
他15年前下的订单
{\fs10\b0}He ordered them 15 years ago.{\r}

527
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:24,610
我忍不住注意到
{\fs10\b0}You know, I couldn't help but, uh,{\r}

528
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,820
这些都是一体成型的
{\fs10\b0}notice that they're all one piece.{\r}

529
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,300
是的，先生
{\fs10\b0}Yes, sir.{\r}

530
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,410
我以为现在没人这么做了
{\fs10\b0}I didn't know people made 'em like that anymore.{\r}

531
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,540
可能还有几个人在做，但很少了
{\fs10\b0}I think there might be a few, but very few.{\r}

532
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,610
要是你哪天重新接单
{\fs10\b0}Well, uh, if you're ever taking orders,{\r}

533
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,300
我真想订一双
{\fs10\b0}I sure would love a pair.{\r}

534
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,610
这双你拿去吧
{\fs10\b0}Go ahead and take 'em.{\r}

535
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,960
你确定吗？- 你从迪克森溪
{\fs10\b0}- You sure? - You brought that herd{\r}

536
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,480
赶牛群下来的？
{\fs10\b0}down from Dixon Creek?{\r}

537
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,990
是的，先生
{\fs10\b0}Yes, sir.{\r}

538
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,720
你比那些牛更需要它
{\fs10\b0}You're gonna need them more than that cattle did.{\r}

539
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:54,170
我可能还会再做一双
{\fs10\b0}I might give another pair.{\r}

540
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,440
那么
{\fs10\b0}Well...{\r}

541
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,890
我该付多少钱？
{\fs10\b0}how much, uh, do I owe you?{\r}

542
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,370
不用担心这个
{\fs10\b0}Just don't worry about it.{\r}

543
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,170
那真是太感谢了
{\fs10\b0}Well, I appreciate it.{\r}

544
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,820
祝你愉快
{\fs10\b0}You have a good one, now.{\r}

545
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,510
你也是
{\fs10\b0}You do the same.{\r}

546
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,680
你好啊，达斯蒂，见到你真高兴
{\fs10\b0}How are you, Dusty? Good to see you{\r}

547
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,340
我也是
{\fs10\b0}You too.{\r}

548
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,100
那匹是哪一个？
{\fs10\b0}Which one is that there?{\r}

549
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,440
是卡特家的毕加索
{\fs10\b0}That's Cat's Picasso.{\r}

550
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,230
从加拿大来的
{\fs10\b0}Came down from Canada.{\r}

551
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,850
这小子很有灵性
{\fs10\b0}Heart in that son of a gun.{\r}

552
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,340
而且漂亮得很，是不是？- 对，先生
{\fs10\b0}- Oh, and damn pretty, too, huh? - Yes, sir.{\r}

553
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,510
克拉珀做的马刺？- 是啊
{\fs10\b0}- Got you some Klappers? - Yeah.{\r}

554
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,720
用整块钢打造的
{\fs10\b0}Makes 'em out of one piece of steel.{\r}

555
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,680
我三十年没见过这种了
{\fs10\b0}I hadn't seen that in 30 years.{\r}

556
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,200
是的，先生
{\fs10\b0}Yes, sir.{\r}

557
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,920
等他走了
{\fs10\b0}When he's gone,{\r}

558
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,440
传奇就都消失了
{\fs10\b0}we're all out of legends.{\r}

559
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,920
也没人想成为下一个传奇
{\fs10\b0}With nobody trying to be the next one.{\r}

560
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,340
从没在没火的地方露营过
{\fs10\b0}Never camped without a fire.{\r}

561
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,340
是啊，要是在这生火
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, well, we start one out here,{\r}

562
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,850
整个县都会烧起来
{\fs10\b0}we'll set the whole damn county on fire.{\r}

563
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,170
我知道，杰克，我就是说说...啊！
{\fs10\b0}I know that, Jake, I'm just saying... Ow!{\r}

564
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,440
啊...该死
{\fs10\b0}Ow... What the fuck?{\r}

565
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,890
这他妈是什么玩意？
{\fs10\b0}What the fuck is that?{\r}

566
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,580
见鬼
{\fs10\b0}Oh, shit.{\r}

567
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,060
痛吗？- 当然痛，要命的痛
{\fs10\b0}- Does that hurt? - Fuck, yeah, it fucking hurts.{\r}

568
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,750
这是德克萨斯给你的见面礼
{\fs10\b0}That's a little "welcome to Texas" for you right there.{\r}

569
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,540
就是这么回事 - 瑞安
{\fs10\b0}- That's what that is. - Ryan.{\r}

570
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,440
把这个敷上去，能止痛
{\fs10\b0}Put that on there. It'll numb it.{\r}

571
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,610
管用吗？
{\fs10\b0}Does it work?{\r}

572
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,920
嗯
{\fs10\b0}Yeah.{\r}

573
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,230
你们想听什么？- 别唱伤心的
{\fs10\b0}- What do y'all want to hear? - Nothing sad.{\r}

574
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,030
别唱失恋的 - 对，别唱
{\fs10\b0}- Nothing about lost love. - No, don't play{\r}

575
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,410
任何关于爱情的
{\fs10\b0}anything about love at all.{\r}

576
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,920
所以我才一直单身
{\fs10\b0}That's why I stay single.{\r}

577
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,270
他爱唱什么就唱什么
{\fs10\b0}He can sing whatever the hell he wants.{\r}

578
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,990
反正影响不了我 - 就算是关于
{\fs10\b0}- It ain't gonna bother me none. - Even if it's about{\r}

579
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,750
笨手笨脚的牛仔也行？
{\fs10\b0}a lazy cowboy can't rope?{\r}

580
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,100
你们干嘛
{\fs10\b0}Hell y'all{\r}

581
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,650
老拿我开玩笑
{\fs10\b0}picking on me for?{\r}

582
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,060
沃克，唱那首，唱杰克之歌
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, Walker, play that one, play the Jake song.{\r}

583
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,270
好吧
{\fs10\b0}All right.{\r}

584
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,440
三十年后
{\fs10\b0}You know, in 30 years from now...{\r}

585
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,890
就不会有人做这些了
{\fs10\b0}...nobody's gonna be doing this.{\r}

586
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:34,750
一个人也不会有
{\fs10\b0}Nobody.{\r}

587
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,440
这片土地都会变成风力发电场
{\fs10\b0}All this country you see will be wind farms{\r}

588
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,170
和太阳能发电场，我们的牛肉
{\fs10\b0}and solar farms and we'll be{\r}

589
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,990
都要从巴西进口
{\fs10\b0}getting our beef from Brazil.{\r}

590
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,750
等他们烧光了雨林之后
{\fs10\b0}After they burn off the rainforest.{\r}

591
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,650
沃克
{\fs10\b0}Walker?{\r}

592
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,820
给我们唱首伤心的歌吧
{\fs10\b0}Go on and play us a sad song.{\r}

593
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,580
这不是我预期的反应
{\fs10\b0}Well, this is not the reaction I was expecting.{\r}

594
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,100
你没有
{\fs10\b0}You didn't...{\r}

595
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,610
哦，亲爱的
{\fs10\b0}Oh, sweetheart.{\r}

596
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,580
我们讨论过这个，你说"继续"
{\fs10\b0}We discussed this and you said, "Go forward."{\r}

597
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,130
这是你干的？
{\fs10\b0}This was you?{\r}

598
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:42,790
这是你说你想要的
{\fs10\b0}This is what you said that you wanted.{\r}

599
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,100
我是说了，但我没...然后
{\fs10\b0}I said it. I didn't... And then...{\r}

600
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,920
我们就再没讨论过
{\fs10\b0}and then we never discussed it again.{\r}

601
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,890
为什么要讨论？
{\fs10\b0}Why would we?{\r}

602
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,030
什么
{\fs10\b0}Wh...{\r}

603
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,340
有什么好讨论的？
{\fs10\b0}What would there be to discuss?{\r}

604
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,440
这些眼泪是为谁流的？
{\fs10\b0}Who are all these tears for?{\r}

605
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,170
为我自己
{\fs10\b0}For me.{\r}

606
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,300
为我自己流的
{\fs10\b0}They're for me.{\r}

607
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:13,440
我父亲，他的遗产
{\fs10\b0}My father, his legacy,{\r}

608
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,790
我的政治前途
{\fs10\b0}my political future--{\r}

609
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,200
全都一枪毙命了
{\fs10\b0}all took a fucking bullet to the brain.{\r}

610
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,200
我以为他是因为我才这样的
{\fs10\b0}I thought he did it because of me.{\r}

611
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,480
因为那次听证会
{\fs10\b0}And the hearing.{\r}

612
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,300
杰米
{\fs10\b0}Jamie.{\r}

613
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,100
别这样
{\fs10\b0}Just stop it.{\r}

614
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,170
这只是你的潜意识
{\fs10\b0}This is your subconscious{\r}

615
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,920
在拼命保护你
{\fs10\b0}desperately trying to protect you,{\r}

616
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,990
但没这个必要
{\fs10\b0}but there's no need.{\r}

617
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,100
你已经受到保护了
{\fs10\b0}You are protected.{\r}

618
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,790
你完全不会受到牵连
{\fs10\b0}You are completely shielded from this.{\r}

619
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,960
我知道事情的结局
{\fs10\b0}I know that the finality of it{\r}

620
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,820
很令人震惊
{\fs10\b0}is traumatic,{\r}

621
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,750
但我需要你专注于没有他的世界
{\fs10\b0}but I need you to focus on a world without him.{\r}

622
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:52,060
专注于你掌控的世界
{\fs10\b0}On a world that you govern,{\r}

623
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,990
你主导的世界
{\fs10\b0}you control.{\r}

624
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,820
不要为
{\fs10\b0}Do not mourn{\r}

625
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,030
一个从未爱过你的68岁老人哀悼
{\fs10\b0}a 68-year-old man that never loved you.{\r}

626
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,510
他在情感和经济上都抛弃了你
{\fs10\b0}He abandoned you, emotionally and financially,{\r}

627
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:02,100
但你依然成功了
{\fs10\b0}yet you still succeeded.{\r}

628
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,030
他设下的每个障碍
{\fs10\b0}You overcame every single obstacle{\r}

629
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,580
你都克服了
{\fs10\b0}that he put before you.{\r}

630
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,680
你赢了
{\fs10\b0}You won.{\r}

631
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:11,750
看着我
{\fs10\b0}Look at me.{\r}

632
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:17,300
雄狮不会老死
{\fs10\b0}Lions don't die of old age.{\r}

633
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,100
雄狮死于年轻狮子的獠牙之下
{\fs10\b0}Lions die in the jaws of younger lions,{\r}

634
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,580
而你就是那头年轻的狮子
{\fs10\b0}and you are the younger lion.{\r}

635
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,340
这片领地现在是你的了
{\fs10\b0}This is your kingdom now.{\r}

636
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,680
谢谢
{\fs10\b0}Thank you.{\r}

637
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,790
这是信托文件
{\fs10\b0}This is the trust.{\r}

638
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,100
泰特是受益人
{\fs10\b0}Tate is beneficiary.{\r}

639
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,920
而你现在是执行人
{\fs10\b0}And you are now the executor.{\r}

640
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,820
遗产税怎么办
{\fs10\b0}What about the inheritance tax?{\r}

641
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,270
本金不用缴税
{\fs10\b0}No, we don't pay it on the principal,{\r}

642
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,130
只需缴纳本金产生的收益
{\fs10\b0}just the income from the principal.{\r}

643
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,410
但是
{\fs10\b0}But, uh...{\r}

644
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,100
州政府和国税局
{\fs10\b0}at both the state{\r}

645
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,060
他们会认定
{\fs10\b0}and the IRS, they will argue{\r}

646
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,790
未实现收益也属于收入，但是
{\fs10\b0}that unrealized gains are income, but...{\r}

647
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,480
我们更大的麻烦是杰米想要撤销
{\fs10\b0}our bigger problem is Jamie seeking to revoke{\r}

648
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,270
保护地役权，他明天就会开始行动
{\fs10\b0}the conservation easement, which he will start tomorrow.{\r}

649
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,270
我不相信父亲会自杀
{\fs10\b0}I don't believe that our father would commit suicide.{\r}

650
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:20,750
他确实没有
{\fs10\b0}He didn't.{\r}

651
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,480
是杰米干的吗
{\fs10\b0}Is this Jamie?{\r}

652
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:23,960
我也不觉得是杰米
{\fs10\b0}I also don't see how it was Jamie.{\r}

653
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,680
我不认为他有这个能力
{\fs10\b0}I don't see how he could do it.{\r}

654
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,440
那个没种的废物什么都干不成
{\fs10\b0}That gutless piece of shit can't do anything on his own.{\r}

655
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,650
什么都不行
{\fs10\b0}Anything, but...{\r}

656
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,480
但他一定找到了能干这事的人
{\fs10\b0}he sure as hell found somebody who could.{\r}

657
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,510
那房子和街道上都有监控
{\fs10\b0}There's cameras in that house and on the street.{\r}

658
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,610
嗯
{\fs10\b0}Mm.{\r}

659
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,440
你为什么不打电话给州警
{\fs10\b0}Why don't you call the state police?{\r}

660
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,030
凯西，打电话问问他们
{\fs10\b0}Kayce, call 'em.{\r}

661
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,060
问问监控录像里看到了什么
{\fs10\b0}Ask 'em what they saw on those cameras.{\r}

662
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,100
我在州警那边没有权限
{\fs10\b0}I don't have any authority with the state police.{\r}

663
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,790
你他妈就是州警
{\fs10\b0}You are the fucking state police.{\r}

664
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:55,130
畜牧委员会是州警分支机构，凯西
{\fs10\b0}The livestock commission-- it's a branch, Kayce.{\r}

665
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,410
打电话问问
{\fs10\b0}Call them. Ask them.{\r}

666
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,030
请求部门间协助
{\fs10\b0}Ask them for some departmental cooperation,{\r}

667
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,990
看在上帝份上，他是你父亲啊
{\fs10\b0}for God's sake. I mean, he's your father.{\r}

668
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,990
开免提
{\fs10\b0}Put it on speaker.{\r}

669
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,510
警长办公室
{\fs10\b0}Sergeant's desk.{\r}

670
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,920
谁负责达顿州长的案子
{\fs10\b0}Who's the lead on Governor Dutton?{\r}

671
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,410
麦金托什和迪拉德
{\fs10\b0}McIntosh and Dillard.{\r}

672
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,920
现在谁值班？迪拉德
{\fs10\b0}- Who's on now? - Dillard.{\r}

673
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:27,820
请帮我接通，我是达顿专员
{\fs10\b0}Can you connect me, please? This is Commissioner Dutton.{\r}

674
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,510
好的，我帮您转接，节哀顺变
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, I'll put you through. Real sorry.{\r}

675
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,650
谢谢
{\fs10\b0}Thank you.{\r}

676
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,170
我是迪拉德，专员
{\fs10\b0}Uh, this is Dillard. Commissioner,{\r}

677
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,820
我们都深感遗憾
{\fs10\b0}we are all real sorry over here.{\r}

678
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,340
死因确定了吗
{\fs10\b0}Is the COD official?{\r}

679
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:42,680
恐怕是的
{\fs10\b0}I'm afraid it is.{\r}

680
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,340
他手上有火药痕迹
{\fs10\b0}There were powder burns on his hand,{\r}

681
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,750
他注册的手枪上有指纹
{\fs10\b0}prints on the pistol registered to him.{\r}

682
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,340
监控里看到了吗
{\fs10\b0}And you watched it on surveillance?{\r}

683
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,610
我们没有监控录像
{\fs10\b0}We don't have the surveillance footage.{\r}

684
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,850
信号发射器在
{\fs10\b0}The transponder went down{\r}

685
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:56,340
3点50分左右失灵了
{\fs10\b0}around 3:50.{\r}

686
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,580
导致三个街区停电
{\fs10\b0}Knocked out power to three city blocks.{\r}

687
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,440
但居民们都不知道
{\fs10\b0}Neighborhood never knew{\r}

688
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,890
因为西北电力公司在
{\fs10\b0}'cause, uh, Northwestern had it up and running{\r}

689
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,610
5点18分就修复了
{\fs10\b0}by 5:18.{\r}

690
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,580
官方确定的死亡时间是什么时候
{\fs10\b0}And what's the official time of death?{\r}

691
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,610
法医判定是3点53分
{\fs10\b0}M.E. called it at 3:53.{\r}

692
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,230
好的
{\fs10\b0}Okay.{\r}

693
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,510
就算有录像
{\fs10\b0}It's not something{\r}

694
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,200
你也不会想看的，凯西
{\fs10\b0}you'd want to see even if we had it, Kayce.{\r}

695
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,960
好，谢谢
{\fs10\b0}All right. Thank you.{\r}

696
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,060
真是太巧合了
{\fs10\b0}Well, isn't that convenient?{\r}

697
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,720
杰米根本没有这种人脉
{\fs10\b0}Jamie doesn't even have the contacts.{\r}

698
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,270
但那个市值八百亿的公司
{\fs10\b0}The $80 billion dollar company{\r}

699
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,170
父亲在蒙大拿经营的公司就有
{\fs10\b0}our father ran out of Montana sure does.{\r}

700
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,960
他只需要开口
{\fs10\b0}All he had to do was want it.{\r}

701
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,270
去看着他的眼睛，如果有必要的话，凯西
{\fs10\b0}Go look him in the eye if you have to, Kacey.{\r}

702
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,100
看着他的眼睛
{\fs10\b0}Look him in the eye.{\r}

703
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:51,170
然后回来帮我决定怎么杀了他
{\fs10\b0}Then come home and help me decide how to kill him.{\r}

704
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:59,170
