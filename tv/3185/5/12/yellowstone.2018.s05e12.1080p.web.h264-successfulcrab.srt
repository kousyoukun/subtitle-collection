That bit's for monsters.

135
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,170
为什么他们叫它鳄鱼鼻吸？
Why do they call it a gator snaffle?

136
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,480
因为你可以骑鳄鱼
Because you can ride an alligator

137
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,100
-和那个讨厌的混蛋。——丹妮卡
- with that nasty fucker. - [Travis] Danica,

138
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,680
你能把那个凯莉·凯莉给我拿来吗
can you go grab me that Kerry Kelly

139
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,930
在这白痴被杀之前偷吃狗骨头？
dog bone snaffle before this idiot gets killed?

140
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,310
你是怎么做的？你只是在早上醒来吗
What do you do? Do you just wake up in the morning

141
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,650
你就试着想办法
and you just try to think of ways

142
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,890
被人从马上摔下来吗？
to get fucking bucked off a horse?

143
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,580
我知道你很蠢。
Look, I know you're dumb.

144
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,480
我们，我们都知道你…你知道你很笨，
We-we, we all know you're... You know you're dumb,

145
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,930
但我没想到你有那么笨。
but I didn't think you were that fucking dumb.

146
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,580
我觉得你没那么蠢。
And I don't think you are that dumb.

147
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,270
你知道我怎么想吗？我想你坐在这里
You know what I think? I think you're sitting here

148
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,790
想念那个黑发小女孩
missing that little brunette

149
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,510
你给我把你的屁股打趴下，好吗？
and you're gonna get your ass bucked off, all right?

150
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,510
是你想当驯马师的，伙计。
You're the one who wanted to be a horse trainer, buddy.

151
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,480
好吧?你想回去找小母牛，随你便。
All right? You want to go back and prowl heifers, be my guest.

152
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,100
-[手机震动]-[清喉咙]对不起。

(叹息)
[sighs]

156
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,440
伙计，这个吉米真是个头昏眼花的混蛋。他妈的为什么？
Man, this Jimmy is one dizzy son of a bitch. Why the fuck

157
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,030
-是你们派他来的吗？——[瑞普笑]
- did y'all send him here? - [Rip chuckles]

158
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,650
是啊，这也是他的魅力所在。
Yeah, well, that's part of his charm.

159
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,650
（笑）是啊，我看不出有什么魅力。
[chuckles] Yeah, I don't see a lot of charm in it.

160
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,030
怎么了，兄弟？< / i >
<i>What's going on, brother?</i>

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,410
我猜你还没听说？
So I'm guessing you haven't heard?

162
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,200
（笑）到中午这里华氏106度。
[laughs] It's 106 here by noon, man.

163
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,550
我要在凌晨两点前赶第一班。
I'm on the first one by 2 a.m.

164
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,000
我们直到日落才停下来。
We don't stop till sundown.

165
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,270
如果他们在纽约投下炸弹，
If they dropped a bomb on New York City,

166
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,720
我不会知道的。
I would not know about it.

167
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,170
他们没有，但他们刚刚向我们扔了一个。
Well, they didn't, but they just dropped one on us.

168
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,890
约翰·达顿死了。
John Dutton died.

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,930
真的吗?发生了什么事?
Really? What happened?

170
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,000
那是另一个故事了。
Well, that's a story for another time.

171
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,370
听着，我需要你的帮助，兄弟。
Listen, I need your help, brother.

172
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,680
是的。我能做什么？
Yeah. What can I do?

173
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,580
你能把我们所有的马移动多快？
How fast can you move all of our horses?

174
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,310
-我们得腾出点现金。<i>-看，伙计，</i>
- We got to free up some cash. <i>- Look, man,</i>

175
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,620

you guys rushed into buying these things, all right?

176
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,030
不要急于出售。
Don't rush selling them.

177
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,100
好吧?让我用正确的方式来做。

178
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,130
我是说，尽可能快地行动。
Well, I mean, move as fast as you can.

179
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,720
那里卖不掉的，我们就在这里卖。
What we don't sell there we'll disperse at a sale up here.

180
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,610
让我把这里的马都卖了，好吗？
Let me sell all the show horses down here, okay?

181
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,480
他们会把1美元的30美分带到那里。
They're gonna bring 30 cents on the dollar up there.

182
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,300

Shit. Our heads are in the guillotine.

183
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,170
是的。我们有麻烦了。
Yeah. We're in a real spot.

184
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,820
好吧，好吧，这不会让事情变得更好
<i>Okay, well, that's not gonna make it any better.</i>

185
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,030
好吧?让我用正确的方式来做，好吗？
All right? Let me do this the right way, okay?

186
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,820
我觉得你儿子不知道。
I don't think your boy knows.

187
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,440
要我把电话递给他吗？
You want me to hand him the phone?

188
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,200
我是说，说实话，兄弟，我…
I mean, to be honest with you, brother, I...

189
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,890

194
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,890
我们得把黄石公园的马都卖了。

195
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,130
——好吗?-比如大甩卖？
- Okay? - Like fire sale?

196
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,580
不，我们得试着赚大钱，
No, we got to try and get top dollar,

早....。
Morning.

00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,620
(贝丝叹息)
[Beth sighs]

698
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,550
没错。
That it is.

699
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,270
我是说，早上好。
I mean, good morning.

700
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,820
好吧，这是相当冒昧的
Well, that's fairly presumptuous

701
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,060
根据我们最近连续几个早上的记录。
based on the string of mornings we've put together lately.

702
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,240
你想吃早餐吗？

703
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,300
已经做好了。
Already made it.

704
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:04,790
你能让凯西等他结束后和我一起去门廊吗？
Um, can you ask Kayce to join me on the porch when he's done?

705
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,030
他离开了。
He left.

706
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,000
离开哪里?

来吧，艾丽。别让他们出去。

710
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,480
哦，递给我！通过了!
Oh, pass it! Pass left!

711
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,130
开枪吧!

713
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,790
这就对了！干得好，女士们。

[欢呼，掌声继续]

干得好，运动健将。
Good job, sport.

717
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,480
好吧，你做得对。
All right, you did the right thing.

718
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,930
当有人站在你面前时，

719
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,790
你把球传给空位前锋。
you pass to the open forward.

720
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,000
但她实现了目标。
But she got the goal.

721
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,650
是啊，但你赢了。
Yeah, but you got the win.

722

在私营部门太自负了，你忘了

这不是你被训练的方式。
It's not the way you were trained.

738

听着，伙计，我们所做的，是严格的
Listen, man, what we do, it is strictly--

739

你得到了分离。你不能被连接。

太好了，你省去了我的麻烦。

我会把你的画在墙上。

因为你对我父亲的所作所为，
for what you did to my father,

750

但我愿意用我的家人换你的

你以为别人不会碰你吗？
You think you can't be touched?

752

看看这对我来说有多容易。

我在球队里待了12年。

It's bottled up. You and me, we're good.

因为我可能明天醒来再做决定

在我的家乡，我们称之为计数政变。
Where I come from, we call that counting coup.

772
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,410
也就是说我带走了你的一部分灵魂
That means I took a piece of your soul

我要留着它

是的，你应该哭。

好好跟你老婆解释吧。

我出来后，你就走。
