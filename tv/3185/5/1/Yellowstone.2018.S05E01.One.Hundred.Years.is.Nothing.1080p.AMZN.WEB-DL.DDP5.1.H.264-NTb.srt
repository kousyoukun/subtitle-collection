<i>Its rivers, its big skies.</i>

78

was to protect those things.</i>

80
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,862

have to trust Governor Dutton</i>

Less than two minutes.

is a sound bite.

of not wearing out his welcome.

98

I'll speak,
then introduce you.

99
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,234
You know,
there's two Senators,

100
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,301
there's only one Governor.

101
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,204
Then we'll do it together.

Montana is in a better place

105
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,984
I mean that.

106
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,186
Would you allow me the honor
of introducing you

107
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,688
to your constituents?

108
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,256
The honor is ours, Jamie.

109
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,397
Well, that was very big of him.

110
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,801
I know how much
your office meant to him.

111
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,777
He's not doing it for you.

112
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,579
He's doing it
to get on the stage.

113
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,582
Aren't we all, Beth?

114
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:35,749
Let's go.

115
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,327
Wow, wow!

116
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:52,132
Well, the future
of Montana is here.

117
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,369
The future of Montana is today.

118
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,039
The future of Montana
is a fifth generation rancher

119
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,908
whose family moved here
six years

120
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,210
before Montana became a state.

121
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,781
It is fitting
that a founding member

122
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,918
of this state a century later,
now leads it.

123
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,958
And defending you in Washington
is another

124
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,227
fifth generation rancher
who has served Montana

125
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,629
in the house of representatives,

126
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,463
and two terms as your governor.

127
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,068
Allow me the honor
of introducing

128
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,504
your next Governor John Dutton
and U.S. Senator Lynelle Perry.

129
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:59,099
Well, the open bar
was my daughter's idea.

130
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,335
I see it worked.

131
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,204
We have a lot of work to do.

132
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,040
And a lot of work to undo.

133
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,142
The question we
all have to answer,

134
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:12,612
the one that I will
look to every day is...

135
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,816
what will Montana look
like in a hundred years?

136
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,820
Much of that is dictated by
the way the world sees us today.

137
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,024
Right now, we are seen as
the rich man's play thing.

138
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:27,961
We are New York's novelty
and California's toy.

139
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,597
Not anymore.

140
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,366
You've elected me to be
a steward of this state,

141
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,702
of its land,
and its people,

142
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,670
and that's exactly
what I will be.

143
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:45,779
You know, environmentalists,
they just love to debate

144
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:50,150
what's Montana's most
valuable resource.

145
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,320
Is it the water,
is it the wolves,

146
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,722
is it trees?

147
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:58,058
The answer is actually
pretty simple.

148
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,626
It's you.

149
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:08,201
The farmers and ranchers who
live with the land, not on it.

150
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,237
Protecting you now
is how Montana

151
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,439
still looks like Montana

152
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,542
when none of us here tonight
are here to see it.

153
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,746
Thank you.

154
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,789
How do you follow that?
I don't know.

155
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,758
Uh, ditto.

156
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,894
The wars that Montana faces
here at home,

157
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,296
those will be my wars
in Washington.

158
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,953
Is this a good thing
or a bad thing?

159
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,088
He'll kill the hotel.

160
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,825
He'll kill the airport.

161
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:40,460
It's a good thing
for the land...

162
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,362
But I don't see
how it's good for us.

163
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,866
Not yet anyway.

164
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,176
That's it.

165
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,116
This fucking family!

166
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,484
Caroline.

167
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,486
I told you to go
after the daughter.

168
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:10,357
And now he's governor...
he will shut us down on day one.

169
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,591
Caroline.

170
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,427
Look at him.

171
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,866
His father is the governor.

172
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,968
He'll be next.

173
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:25,005
Should be the happiest
day of his life.

174
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,373
So why isn't he smiling?

175
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,646
Get Sarah Atwood out here.

176
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,649
You sure?

177
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,521
We're taking
the gloves off, Ellis.

178
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:45,692
I'm tired of playing with
these fucking hillbillies.

179
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,619
You're really embracing
this low-man thing.

180
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,721
I'm in no mood, Beth.

181
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,390
Yeah, I wouldn't be either.

182
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,592
They even let you
ride a horse yet?

183
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,129
They let me ride the buck
out of the two year-olds,

184
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,330
that's about it.

185
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:28,435
Some day I'm gonna be top hand,
you watch.

186
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,071
Wow, so much ambition.

187
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,942
I mean, that's like dreaming of
running the grill at McDonald's.

188
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,076
That's what it's like to you.

189
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,183
Still here?

190
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,251
Barely.

191
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,086
I leave for college tomorrow.

192
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,688
Gonna study finance.

193
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,158
What's that?

194
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,961
How to make money off
other people's money.

195
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,195
Seems like quite the trick.

196
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,030
Gonna find out.

197
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,234
You wanna go out?

198
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,504
Out?

199
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,340
A date.
Before I leave.

200
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,443
Beth, you leave tomorrow.

201
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,145
Your window's closing.

202
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,985
I'll be done
in a couple hours.

203
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,021

We'll see.

219
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,310
Four a.m. comes early.

220
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,282
When did his balls drop?

221
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,084
Today, I guess.

00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,761
I'll let you play "man".

223

You do know how
to drive, don't you?

224
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,983
R means reverse, D means--

225
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,118
I know what they mean.

226
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,322
This should be interesting.

227
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,190
Ever been here before?

228
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,891
I ain't been nowhere before.

229
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,560
This is where
everybody comes.

230
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,195
Hope your
father don't come here.

231
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,131
My father doesn't
go anywhere.

232
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,400
You want to slide down for me?

233
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,905
They have a great martini.

234
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,142
You like martinis?

235
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,777
Don't know what one is.

236
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,313
Educating you
is going to be fun.

237
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,683
Evening. Can I get
you something to drink?

238
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,353
Vodka martini, three olives.

239
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,854
You want a beer?

240
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:11,358
Just water.

241
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,060
You have I.D.?

242
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:17,830
I have two.

243
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,604
You like that martini dirty?

244
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,307
What do you think?

245
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,444
You got your
hands full, buddy.

246
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,716
That bother you?

247
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,318
Yeah.

248
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,786
Why?

249
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,488
You let him look at
you like--

250
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:45,458
Like what,
like he wants to fuck me?

251
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,794
You look at me that way.

252
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,329
So does every man on earth
to every woman

253
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,365
they find attractive,
and some they don't.

254
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,535
I can be a victim of it,
or a beneficiary.

255
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,305
I choose the latter.

256
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,340
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

257
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,442
Yeah, you do.

258
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,312
You may be stronger than me,
but make no mistake--

259
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,214
men are the weaker sex.

260
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:09,549
You're doing it again.

261
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,917
What am I doing?

262
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,885
Saying shit
I don't understand.

263
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,222
You understand it, you just
don't want it to be true.

264
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,225
I don't want to
fight with you--

265
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,859
Then stop acting like a pussy.

266
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,863
I'm not yours
to be jealous over.

267
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,102
This was a mistake.

268
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,904
Looking that way.

269
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,840
I think we should leave.

270
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,679
You go.
I'll find my own way.

271
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,749
I can't just leave you
here with no way home.

272
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,484
Look, your options are
enjoy dinner or go.

273
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,553
But deciding what I do is not
one of your choices.

274
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,324
I'll thumb a ride.

275
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,160
Where you going?

276
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,530
Don't know.
Back to the ranch, I guess.

277
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,732
Where's your ride?

278
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,066
Ride's staying here.

279
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,905
Listen, if she's bucking
that hard from the beginning,

280
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,240
smartest thing you can do
is just jump off.

281
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,343
You're gonna walk back?

282
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,378
Ain't got much choice.

283
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,079
Hell, come have
a beer with us.

284
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,648
Ain't in the mood.

285
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,520
All right. Take this truck
back to the ranch.

286
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,154
We'll clown car
our way back.

287
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,255
You sure?

288
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,890
Ain't nuthin', pard.

289
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,992
- See you back at the ranch.
- Thanks.

290
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,289
You're up early.

291
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,560
Yeah, big day.

292
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,930
When's that getting started?

293
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,966
Around five, I think.

294
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,068
Is he going to be able
to stick around?

295
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,804
I need him back
in Helena tomorrow so...

296
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,140
We're calving, Beth.
When is he coming back?

297
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,544
In four years.
Maybe eight.

298
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,917
Okay.

299
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,252
You want some coffee?

300
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,657
I'm sorry.

301
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,092
What did you do?

302
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,731
Nothing recently, but...

303
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,470
For what I did then, I'm sorry.

304
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,073
When then, Beth?

305
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:31,511
This is a sort of a...
blanket apology to

306
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,847
generally, you know,
cover the past.

307
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,717
- The past.
- Yeah.

308
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,586
All right.

309
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,555
Like everything
before right now.

310
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,356
- That's what I'm sorry for.
- Mm.

311
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,760
Honey...

312
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,028
and I mean this with love,

313
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,963
but it's way too early
for this shit.

314
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,499
I was fucking awful to you.

315
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,636
I was terrible, and I...

316
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:04,176
If it is any consolation,
I was worse on myself.

317
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,545
You know what
your problem is?

318
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:09,381
It's this.

319
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,951
It's almost as big as this.

320
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,522
And I'm the only one
that knows that you have this,

321
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:19,626
but you do, and baby,
it's big...

322
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:24,330
But when this gets going and
then this gets going too...

323
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,635
I robbed us of so much time
together, because I was...

324
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,977
It's still robbing us.

325
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,812
Whatever it took,
I don't need.

326
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,380
I'm happy, Beth.

327
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,682
With you.
With life. Everything's good.

328
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:45,384
But we needed what it took.

329
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:48,788
Come here.

330
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:52,659
Baby...

331
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:59,431
You need to find
somebody new to fight,

332
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:02,569
or you're gonna
sit around this house

333
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,571
and you're just gonna
beat the shit out of yourself.

334
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:09,075
Okay?

335
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:13,913
You did put me
through hell, though.

336
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:15,014
Yeah.

337
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,454
But you're all mine now
though, aren't you? Hm?

338
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,691
Every last fucking
inch of me.

339
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,498
You need to
let yourself be happy.

340
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,671
That's the goal
for you today.

341
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:41,708
I want you to find something
that makes you happy.

342
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,509
Can you do that for me?

343
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:50,516
Vodka makes me happy.

344
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,518
Come on, now, I mean it.

345
00:25:55,688 --> 00:26:00,292
I promise. I will find
something that makes me happy.

346
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,330
I love you.
See you in a bit.

347
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,516
Jesus Christ.

348
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,288
Can you believe this
fucking shit show?

349
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,323
It's gonna be quite a party.

350
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,260
The party ain't for us, Lloyd.
We got calves on the ground.

351
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,495
Take that shit and go
around the other side.

352
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,066
Listen up.

353
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:44,270
You see a coyote prowling our
calves I want you to shoot it.

354
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,305
You see a wolf prowling
one of our calves,

355
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,707
I want you to shoot it.

356
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,676
If you see a bear
let's try to haze him off.

357
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:52,344
Now if he's on a carcass,
we call it in.

358
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,013
Just take a picture with your
phones. Let's go to work.

359
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,350
Why not shoot it?

360
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,152
Take a picture
and run it off.

361
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,889
You can't shoot a bear unless
he's chasing livestock.

362
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:05,257
Makes no fucking sense.

363
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,522
You know, politicians are
always talking

364
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,725
about feeding the poor.

365
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:43,395
That breakfast
buffet could do it.

366
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,265
Mm-hmm.

367
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,634
You know, in half an hour,
this entire room is going

368
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:51,771
to be filled with your staff.
- Yeah.

369
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:54,440
And they're going to eat and
they're going to discuss

370
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,375
the issues of the day.

371
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,110
And then they will scheme
and barter and bargain

372
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,480
to decide which issues
deserve your attention.

373
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,050
Yeah.

374
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,152
You have no friends
in this building, John.

375
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,787
You're going to need
to bring your own.

376
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:10,389
And I could kill you for
putting me in this building

377
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,759
with my bare hands, Lynelle.

378
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:15,627
You offered.
I wanted your son.

379
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:19,398
I could've controlled him,
you know.

380
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,333
Now, I gotta deal with you.

381
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,336
Well, I'm...
I'm pretty easy to bribe.

382
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,838
Oh, I'm well aware.

383
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,373
Every time I want
a bill pushed through

384
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,075
I'm going to find myself
in a coat closet.

385
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:34,280
It's going to be an
interesting four years.

386
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:39,251
Four years is a long time.

387
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,686
This is not where
I want to spend it.

388
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:47,927
Are you going to run
again in 2026?

389
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:50,062
Not on your life.

390
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,099
All right. Think about
the power in that, John:

391
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,835
a governor that doesn't care
about being re-elected.

392
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:58,370
That doesn't have to make
friends with his enemies

393
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,273
for some future compromise.

394
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:04,176
You don't have
to compromise at all.

395
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:07,613
You can build a legal wall
around this state.

396
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:08,848
And maybe in the next
hundred years,

397
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,416
this place looks the same.

398
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,455
But in the meantime, you have
a friend in Washington.

399
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,158
And you're gonna need one.

400
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,891
Hold 'em up.
Hold 'em up.

401
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:06,505
Shit.

402
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:10,176
Move 'em! Move 'em! Move 'em!

403
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,717
What do we do?

404
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,520
Get across the river! You want
to go to jail in America?

405
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,547
Get back!

406
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:02,054
Hey! You're on the wrong side!

407
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,523
Get back!

408
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,129
On the other side, now.

409
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:11,697
Get back.

410
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,877
You rode on our side!

411
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,446
Yeah.

412
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,448
You have no authority
on this side.

413
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,586
- Take care of him.
- Yep.

414
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,730
Those horses
belong on this side.

415
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,132
The thieves belong over here.

416
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,568
They didn't make
it into Canada.

417
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,536
They haven't committed
a crime on that side yet.

418
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,572
Yeah, they didn't
commit this crime.

419
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,674
They committed plenty others.

420
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,710
We trade.

421
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,881
They didn't look too worried
about Canadian prison.

422
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:39,085
They seemed pretty worried
about ours, though.

423
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:40,619
You want a feather in your cap

424
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,254
or do you wanna see these
sons of bitches in prison

425
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:43,622
for the next ten years?

426
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:53,332
Sergeant,
bring the horses across.

427
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:29,301
Great.
Now we gotta herd them up.

428
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:32,504
It might be the wild west on
that side, but on this side

429
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,540
rules are the foundation
of order,

430
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,476
and order holds the flanks
of a civilized society.

431
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:40,011
Yeah.
It's also how you herd sheep.

432
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,148
You calling us sheep?

433
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:43,382
I didn't call you nuthin'.

434
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,151
You said it yourself.

435
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,998
What a shit show.

436
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,605
It's a show.
That's a fact.

437
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,908
But it's our show now.

438
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:50,048
What are you going
to do first?

439
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:51,783
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

440
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,420
They're ready, Dad.

441
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:00,759
Here we go.

442
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,358
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be seated.

443
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:49,100
Mr. Dutton, face me and
raise your right hand.

444
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,508
Place your
left hand on the Bible.

445
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,915
I...
State your name...

446
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,390
State your name.

447
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:25,804
State your name.

448
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,006
Daddy?

449
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,512
I, John Dutton...

450
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:36,214
- Do solemnly swear...
- Do solemnly swear...

451
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:39,017
To uphold the Constitution
of the United States...

452
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,720
To uphold the Constitution of
the United States...

453
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,155
And the Constitution
of the State of Montana...

454
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,024
And the Constitution of
the State of Montana...

455
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:49,995
- Against all enemies...
- Against all enemies...

456
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,631
- Foreign and domestic...
- Foreign and domestic.

457
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,733
Congratulations.

458
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:59,070
You had a chance
to be rid of him.

459
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,508
You did nothing
and he grew stronger.

460
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:06,044
It's slave rules for you now
and it's all your fault.

461
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,879
I present to you
the 26th Governor

462
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:11,216
of the great state
of Montana, John Dutton.

463
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:29,601
Well, I am not a politician.

464
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:32,103
This was never my plan.

465
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:37,242
My only plan was to preserve
my family's way of life

466
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:39,344
and the land
where they make it.

467
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:42,448
The fact that
you're...

468
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:43,615
The fact that
you're sitting here,

469
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:45,183
the fact that you
voted for a man

470
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:49,154
who does not want this job
to lead this state,

471
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,122
means we share the same goals.

472
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,662
My first act as Governor
will be to cancel funding

473
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:59,130
for the Paradise Valley
airport project

474
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,901
and the surrounding commercial
and housing developments.

475
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,503
God isn't making any more land

476
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,638
and he certainly isn't
filling any more rivers.

477
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:14,480
Next I will propose to
the State Assembly

478
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,348
to double property taxes
for non-residents.

479
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,187
I will also add a
6 percent state sales tax

480
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:26,424
to all goods sold
for non-residents.

481
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,961
I will charge vehicle
registration fees

482
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:31,997
to non-residents.

483
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:36,735
The message is this:
we are not your playground,

484
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:40,438
we are not your haven
from the pollution and traffic

485
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,341
and mismanagement
of your home states.

486
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:46,645
This is our home.

487
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:49,414
Perhaps if you choose
to make Montana your home,

488
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,883
you will start treating
it like a home

489
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:55,286
and not a vacation rental.

490
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:59,491
Thank you.

491
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:07,966
Did you know about this?

492
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,635
This is going to set
the state back thirty years.

493
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,236
That's a pretty
good start, Jamie.

494
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,438
The plan is set
it back a hundred.

495
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:14,706
I'm not even sure he
has the authority.

496
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,207
I'm not even sure it's legal.

497
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,544
When did something being
legal bother you, Jamie? Hm?

498
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:21,647
If it isn't legal you're going
to help him make it legal.

499
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:23,348
You're gonna push
all this through.

500
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,151
I'm about to work you
like a rented mule, brother.

501
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,319
It's time for your
pound of flesh.

502
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:32,558
- Can you get me out of here?
- Yeah, let's go.

503
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,883
Want a whiskey, Daddy?

504
00:41:57,883 --> 00:41:59,050
Why not?

505
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,586
Can I get one of those?

506
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:01,587
Go fuck yourself.

507
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,456
Make your brother a whiskey.

508
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:08,827
I. Will. Not.

509
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:11,763
Here. Here.

510
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,364
Make me another one.

511
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,711
Dad, you should think twice

512
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,345
about canceling
the airport funding.

513
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:31,316
Oh, shit, I've thought
plenty about it.

514
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:33,251
It's five million
a year to the ranch.

515
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,622
For a ranch that loses
three... Do the math.

516
00:42:36,622 --> 00:42:38,089
You know, there's other
revenue streams

517
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,090
for the ranch, Jamie.

518
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,458
Oh, name one.

519
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,060
Well, I'm getting
a mil-five for the party.

520
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,394
You're charging the State
a million dollars

521
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,830
for his inauguration party.

522
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,798
Actually,
I'm charging his campaign.

523
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,399
Oh, is that it?
Well, that's worse, Beth.

524
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,268
He can't benefit
from campaign funding,

525
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,070
that's how he gets impeached
on his first day in office.

526
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,105
He's not benefitting
from it, Jamie.

527
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:56,441
A Utah LLC is
benefitting from it.

528
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,909
We're all going to prison.

529
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,444
You know, it is the eighth
wonder of the world

530
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:00,746
you aren't already there.

531
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,113
Will you two just
shut the fuck up

532
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,249
and let me enjoy
the last hour of quiet

533
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,818
I'm gonna experience in
the next four years?

534
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:15,727
- This is all your fault.
- That's right.

535
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:16,728
This was never
supposed to be me.

536
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:18,263
It was supposed to be you.

537
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,731
It could have been me.
It should've been me.

538
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:20,732
No.

539
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:21,967
I could've won.

540
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:25,671
Oh, of that I have, uh,
I have no doubt.

541
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:26,738
But then what?

542
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,345
You know, it must break my
wife's heart to look down

543
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,815
and see what a mess
I have made of this family.

544
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,754
What an embarrassment
we are to the sacrifice

545
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,455
it took to give us a home.

546
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:51,529
But I tell you what...

547
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:54,099
Sacrifice is exactly
what we are going to do.

548
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:58,103
It's what you're
going to do, Jamie.

549
00:43:58,103 --> 00:44:01,773
You are going to sacrifice
your ambition.

550
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:03,308
You are going to sacrifice
your fear,

551
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,276
your weak,
self-loathing heart.

552
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,312
You're going to kill all that
and you're going to get strong.

553
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:10,481
And no matter how it scares
you or how much you disagree,

554
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,283
you are going to do exactly
what the fuck I tell you

555
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,452
for the next four years.

556
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:15,787
Exactly.

557
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:20,625
Make no mistake,
I love Montana,

558
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:24,229
But I am doing this
for our ranch.

559
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:25,864
We measure
every decision

560
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:28,867
against what is good
for the ranch.

561
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:31,569
The ranch comes first.
Do you understand me?

562
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:32,938
I understand.

563
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:37,876
Always, Daddy.

564
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,753
What's said between us
stays between us.

565
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:49,988
You understand?

566
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,590
They sign confidentiality
agreements, Dad.

567
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,093
I won't say a word, Governor.

568
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:57,228
Except this--

569
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,766
If I had your ranch,
I'd do the same thing.

570
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:08,306
You make sure this is
my driver every time.

571
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,515
♪ There was no one in this town
that would give me a ride ♪

572
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:22,320
Hey, how dressy
is this, Dale?

573
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,789
I don't know.

574
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:24,923
It's a party for
the fucking Governor.

575
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,993
So pretty dressy, I guess.

576
00:45:27,993 --> 00:45:30,095
But since you don't
have any dresses

577
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:31,196
it doesn't really matter
how dressy it is.

578
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:32,630
Screw you,
I got dresses.

579
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,800
You have dresses?

580
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,801
I've got dresses.

581
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:37,302
You have dresses?

582
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:38,937
Is there a fucking
echo in here?

583
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:40,839
Hey Teeter,
Jake's got dresses too

584
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:42,107
if you need to borrow one.

585
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:44,810
That's a little
out of left field.

586
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,611
What the hell
you messing with me for?

587
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:49,147
I'd love to see the dress
that Jake could fit into.

588
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:51,682
Be about the size of
a fucking bed sheet.

589
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:53,819
What the hell are you
all on my ass for?

590
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:56,154
Ah, hell, Jake, something
frilly might look good on you.

591
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:57,823
You know?
A little lace in there.

592
00:45:57,823 --> 00:45:58,824
What the hell
are you laughing at?

593
00:45:58,824 --> 00:46:01,192
Hey.

594
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:04,896
I don't need you all drunk,
this party ain't for you.

595
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:09,300
Ethan, you want to tell
me what is so fucking funny?

596
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,736
Jake's trying to pick
out his dress for tonight.

597
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:14,639
His what?

598
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:16,474
He wants to wear
a dress, sir.

599
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:18,043
He wants to wear...

600
00:46:18,043 --> 00:46:20,045
Jake, hey, you got
a bet to settle,

601
00:46:20,045 --> 00:46:22,113
you settle it somewhere else.

602
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,082
You put on a fucking dress

603
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:25,650
and go to the
Governor's ball tonight

604
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,152
I'm gonna hang you in it,
you understand me?

605
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:28,619
You understand what
I fucking say?

606
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,921
I ain't wearing
no damn dress.

607
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:31,589
Just be... whoa, whoa.

608
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:33,724
Just behave.

609
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:35,393
And don't be an idiot.

610
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,661
Now let's go,
put your show shirts on.

611
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:38,864
Let's go.
Get your shit together.

612
00:46:38,864 --> 00:46:40,899
Go put your show dress on.

613
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,067
Don't be an idiot, Jake.

614
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:44,769

625
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,179
They ought to have
a party like this every year.

626
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,082
Actually, Jake,
they throw it every four years

627
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:32,583
when there's a new governor.

628
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,186
Well, excuse me for not
studying government in college.

629
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,122
The Diesel Academy
is not a college.

630
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:39,024
The more you talk to him,
the more he talks back.

631
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:40,791
Just in case you haven't
caught on to the pattern.

632
00:47:40,926 --> 00:47:43,028
They is on your ass tonight.

633
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:44,262
He's being a prick.

634
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:47,565
Look at this here, guys.

635
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:51,369
Hey, can I get a double Buffalo
Trace on the rocks, please?

636
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:53,939
How much do I owe you?

637
00:47:53,939 --> 00:47:55,974
It's an open bar, sir.

638
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:58,076
Uh, could you make
another one of those?

639
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,244
- Two.
- Three.

640
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:00,778
- Four.

641
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:02,480
I get the picture.

642
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,982
Hell, while you're making em.

643
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06,317
How bout I just make one for
anybody in a cowboy hat?

644
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,386
That'll work.

645
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,356
Hey, it's the Bar M boys.

646
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:13,858
Hey, Stetson, what do ya know.
- I don't know it.

647
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:15,526
I do know there's
a cowboy in the Capitol.

648
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,228
Look at all this...

649
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,530
It's gonna be hell
to clean up tomorrow, I bet.

650
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,332
- Ryan.
- Stet.

651
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,867
Hope they don't make us
sit in there and eat supper.

652
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:24,202
I'll never
figure out them damn forks.

653
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:26,171
Well, you know what?

654
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:29,307
They can't make us do nothing
if they can't find us, huh?

655
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:30,875
Come on, guys.

656
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:32,510
Best news I've heard
all day.

657
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:46,491
Hi.
Hi, how you been?

658
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:47,993
Great to see you.

659
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:56,001
Hi, thanks for coming.
I really appreciate it.

660
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:57,202
Hi.

661
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:01,439
More like
a wedding reception

662
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,474
than your first night
in office, huh?

663
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:06,644
My wedding reception
was in my living room

664
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:09,014
with thirty people.

665
00:49:09,014 --> 00:49:12,683
This looks like
exactly what it is: work.

666
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:14,685
Hi, so nice to see you.

667
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,322
Congratulations.

668
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:18,856
Well, this is more like a
wedding reception

669
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:20,858
than you think, because
you are married to Montana

670
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:22,260
for better or for worse.

671
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,894
Yeah, so everyone
keeps telling me.

672
00:49:30,235 --> 00:49:33,038
All right, I'm gonna wander.

673
00:49:33,038 --> 00:49:35,606
Wait.
You're not gonna eat?

674
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:38,709
In this dress?
Are you fucking kidding me?

675
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,378
I'll see you later.

676
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,313
Have a good night.

677
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:50,388
You know, I
