1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,579
Correction is a method of real-time
image manipulation using the

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,329
deployment of deep fake technology.
They kill people to protect it.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,689
It's Yvonne, isn't it?
If there's anything I can do.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,689
You can get the bastard who did it.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,249
Thanks to the intervention
of our US partners,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,169
Operation Vanguard is secure.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,579
I stopped by the Commissioner's
office this morning,

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,699
handed in my 728.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,609
You're resigning?
Don't worry, Gemma.

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,179
I didn't give the real reason.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,579
Isaac, the deal is still intact.

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,610
What deal?

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,259
Somebody got to you, didn't they?

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,860
And with power, you can do all the
good you ever dreamt of.

15
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,249
I was with Isaac Turner.
He doesn't trust us.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,529
And that is your fault.
Lower your tone.

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,060
I don't let anyone raise their voice
at me off camera.

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,299
What am I looking at?

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,609
Stage 4 stomach cancer.

20
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,819
Hello?
I need you to do something for me.

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,149
Look in the bathroom.

22
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,619
There's a laptop.

23
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,820
Gregory Knox, I am arresting you
for obstructing a police officer.

24
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,769
What are you saying?

25
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,409
You in?

26
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,460
Yes.

27
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,970
OVER COMMS: Shots fired.
Threat neutralised.

28
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:11,510
Target down. Repeat. Target down.

29
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,690
Everything's falling perfectly
into place.

In place of hidden camera recording,

46
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,110
I'm filming this eyewitness
testimony for my dossier detailing

47
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:32,230
the systematic illegal practice
of video evidence tampering

known as corrections.

FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

53
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,101
You think a person can change?

54
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,070
I don't know if I do.

55
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,380
You told us you could change.

56
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,111
My British chums went for it.

57
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:15,179
Danny Hart, thinking with his famous
hard-on.

58
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,949
Garland.

59
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,850
God only knows what she was
thinking of.

60
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:22,389
Me, I told them...

61
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,550
...I'll believe it when I see it.

62
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,490
As for you, fast track.

63
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,669
Boy, you better pray
a person can change.

PHONE VIBRATES

67
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,850
Hello?
Sorry for the unsociable hour.

68
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:55,569
The empire's struck back.

69
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,549
Gill, the Home Sec
that just won't die.

70
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,299
We need to regroup. Respond.

71
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,870
The car's on its way.

72
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:03,939
Erm... OK.

73
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,569
I mean, you heard the recording,
right?

74
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,990
I have got him admitting he
colluded with Aliza to obstruct

75
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:12,499
Victoria Bello's application.

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,850
And for that,
I salute you, Isaac.

77
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,860
But that alone is not a strategy.

78
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:20,219
It's time to launch
Operation Kill Gill.

79
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,279
I'll bring pastries. Any allergies?

80
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,059
Any...?

81
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,569
No. Erm...

82
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,660
...Gregory, is...is this safe?

83
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,449
I mean, us talking on the phone
like this.

84
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,189
So long as it's me you're talking
to, Isaac, you're safe.

85
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,010
LINE GOES DEAD

86
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,500
SHE BREATHES RAGGEDLY

87
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,111
SHE GASPS

88
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:12,759
Face the camera.

89
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,790
Read the highlighted paragraph.

90
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,560
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

91
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,350
Aloud.

92
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,510
QUIETLY: I... Rachel Carey...

93
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,560
...understand...
Oh, Colonel Kurtz. I said aloud.

94
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,189
LOUDER: I, Rachel Carey,

95
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,939
understand that I am currently
within the legal jurisdiction

96
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,741
of the United States of America.

97
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,870
Whilst I remain
within the legal jurisdiction

98
00:06:55,871 --> 00:06:58,419
of the United States of America,

99
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,579
I am bound by the rules, regulations

100
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,500
and limitations of US federal law.

101
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:19,439
Strange -
expecting others to obey your laws

102
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,269
while you break
every last one of ours.

103
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,499
Settle down, wildcat.

104
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,640
You've already got one battle scar.

105
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:36,279
Why did you withhold this critical
piece of intelligence?

106
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,669
Russian state assassin
captured on camera.

107
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,059
You didn't share it?
I'm not talking without a lawyer.

108
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,430
You're not under arrest.

109
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,909
Garland, then.

110
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,590
Beg your pardon?

111
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,200
I want DSU Gemma Garland
present at my interrogation.

112
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:00,990
I'm guessing she's in on this, too.

113
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:02,350
Right?

114
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,920
Sorry, kiddo.

115
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,630
Momma's not home.

116
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,459
Why don't you tell me exactly
how you got a hold of this image.

117
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,669
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

118
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,589
I'd like to put a soaking cloth
over your face between questions.

119
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,390
But... I'm exercising restraint.

120
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:34,149
Gregory Knox shared this with you,
didn't he?

121
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,190
I strongly suggest
you exercise some yourself.

122
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,379
But you already knew who the man
behind the mask was.

123
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,509
Nikolai Mirsky,
if that's his name.

124
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,799
Remember when we talked
about change?

125
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,789
He's not a Russian national, is he?
Now would be a good time to start.

126
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,469
I'm going to say he worked for you

127
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,349
until he became a liability,

128
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,509
and you had his partner
blow his brains out.

129
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,669
I mean... I try to do the right
thing.

130
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,909
I don't know what you're plotting
with Gregory Knox,

131
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,509
but I do hope it's worth it.
And for what? A lot of people seem

132
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,359
to be dying in the process.
An entitled fast-track princess...

133
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,870
Edison Yao. Joseph Mwangi.
..yap-yap-yapping... Jason McKenna.

134
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:13,029
...in my ear... Lee Bradbury.
..doesn't know when...

135
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,001
Patrick Flynn.
..to shut the fuck up!

136
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,459
Your boy had shitty luck.

137
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,279
Saw something he shouldn't.

138
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,560
It happens.

139
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,599
But you, on the other hand - nah,
you got all the luck in the world,

140
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,880
don't you?

141
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:31,669
Wearing a wire,
catching my boy on camera.

142
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,279
You should be lying in the morgue
right next to him.

143
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,159
You would be, too, if it wasn't
for your fucking guardian angels.

144
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,719
SHE GASPS

145
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,820
Frank.

146
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,240
SHE CHOKES AND COUGHS

147
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,669
Operation Kill Gill, phase two.

148
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,750
We need to put Isaac Turner in
front of his biggest audience yet.

149
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:11,639
Take down the Home Secretary
with the whole country watching.

150
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,599
Every public denial
this do of us makes,

151
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,639
the story grows bigger.

152
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,750
Meanwhile, Isaac Turner is simply
trying to get on

153
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:21,589
with his important new schedule -

154
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,279
promoting business schemes, opening
war memorials. Sports initiatives?

155
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,039
Yes.

156
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,239
But those pesky reporters
won't stop badgering him

157
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,909
about Rowan Gill.

158
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,030
In the public interest, you agree
to an exclusive interview.

159
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,519
Look, I... I don't want, you know,
to seem like I'm out for revenge.

160
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,960
I knew you'd get it.

161
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,439
Approximately one hour ago,

162
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,909
I was present at a briefing
with Home Secretary Rowan Gill,

163
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,750
who I learned has full knowledge

164
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:04,469
of Correction and its use
within the UK.

165
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,910
Also present was Commander Hart
and DSU Garland.

166
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,639
It appears somebody recently tried
to wipe it all from your computer.

167
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,799
The laptop hidden in your bathroom?

168
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,469
But hadn't quite managed to
delete it from the deleted folder.

169
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,599
Rookie mistake. Fucking Abigail.

170
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,470
I must say,
I found it rather sweet...

171
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,080
...your little journal.

172
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,470
Not quite Edward Snowden.
More... Adrian Mole.

173
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,309
And then I reminded myself
that naivety and treachery

174
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,270
are not mutually exclusive.

175
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:46,710
Who else is involved...

176
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,910
...in your plot?

177
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,599
Guv. Yeah.

178
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,159
I think the SO-15 contingent
is seriously overdue a briefing.

179
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,519
I sent three armed units off to
the suspect vehicle last night.

180
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,529
Ten minutes later, we get "shots
fired" over comms and "target down".

181
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,359
And? Between all three units,

182
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,829
not one firearms officer
claimed the kill.

183
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,829
You're questioning the comms
traffic? I'm questioning everything,

184
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,599
after recent events.

185
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,089
Did we take down a suspect? Yes.

186
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,630
Is there a body? There usually is
when someone's killed.

187
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:33,469
There was a lot of confusion
in the vicinity, by all accounts.

188
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,919
There was a lot of confusion
in the control room, guv.

189
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,470
Disappearing vehicles -
sound familiar?

190
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,549
A major event in Operation Vanguard

191
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,549
and not one of us had eyes on.

192
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,349
A bit of reassurance
wouldn't go amiss

193
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,400
from someone we can trust.

194
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,239
VIDEO: Welcome to the nightmare
that is Correction, Isaac.

195
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,239
Our enemies fake things
which we can't deny.

196
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,239
There's a lot of information
on this video file,

197
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,159
and I don't mean
from Rowan Gill.

198
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,630
The resolution suggests the type of
camera used more by journalists

199
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:18,079
than police.

200
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,480
So I ask you again...

201
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,270
...who else is involved?

202
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,741
Khadija Khan?

203
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
It's over, Rachel.

204
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,950
We have everything from your first
transgression to your most recent.

205
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,920
Not forgetting...

206
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,919
...this little gem.

207
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,880
VIDEO: Patrick wasn't meant
to be a target, though, was he?

208
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:50,819
After everything we've done for
you, this is how you repay us.

209
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,499
And it wouldn't be
the first time

210
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,559
you failed to stop it!
That is enough!

211
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,709
Hannah Roberts was an enemy
of the British state.

212
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,190
VIDEO STOPS

213
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,990
What did you expect?

214
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,169
You monitor me in my home.

215
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,839
I beg your pardon? Cameras in every
room, watching me day and night.

216
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,239
Naturally, I can neither

217
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,389
confirm or deny any such operation.
In my bedroom!

218
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,609
If you were under surveillance...
Watching me in bed!

219
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,969
...it's turned out to be
entirely justified. I can't sleep!

220
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,449
You secretly recorded British
intelligence. I needed insurance!

221
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,600
Oh!

222
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,360
What a crushing disappointment
you are, Rachel.

223
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,839
After all the chances
you've been given.

224
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,630
You kept me in the dark from the
moment I joined the department,

225
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:39,069
banishing me to Mapping...

226
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,989
What is it about your generation...
..keeping me under surveillance.

227
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,689
...that causes you to melt at the
denial of instant gratification?

228
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,280
You were serving a penance. You were
supposed to be earning our trust.

229
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,250
I was impressed with you.

230
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,040
You saw this was
all Frank Napier's doing.

231
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,399
Before me.

232
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,050
Before any of us.

233
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,969
You even managed to get the man
to blurt out his culpability

234
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,479
right in front of you,

235
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,549
even if it did mean
nearly getting your throat slit.

236
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,079
You're not bad, Rachel.

237
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,839
You've got the capacity
for the work, all right.

238
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,910
And you want to squander it all...

239
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,020
...so you can be
some whistle-blower?

240
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,709
And then what?

241
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,889
Go into hiding, take refuge
in Russia for the rest of your life?

242
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,180
There were opportunities for you.

243
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,590
Still would be.

244
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,360
I mean, if I felt for a second
I could trust you.

245
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,980
What does that mean?

246
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,521
Danny Hart's handed in his notice.

247
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,999
SO-15 will need a new commander.

248
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,590
The new commander of SO-15...

249
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,640
...me?

250
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,760
No. What?

251
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:06,919
Me.

252
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,049
Oh.

253
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,770
But if I were to step
into Danny Hart's shoes,

254
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,520
I'd need someone
to step into mine.

255
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:15,919
You expect me to believe,
after all this,

256
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,570
you'd want me on your team?

257
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:23,289
I should have known
you'd fail to understand.

258
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,969
Well, forgive me, but I like my work
a little less tainted

259
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,949
with murder and corruption.

260
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,750
Perhaps you're concussed.

261
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:34,339
You, Frank Napier, Gregory Knox -

262
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,259
I'm guessing you're all
in on this together.

263
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,029
Gregory Knox

264
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,229
is a scourge on human society.

265
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,829
He's everything that's wrong
with power, politics and technology

266
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,949
in the world today.

267
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,099
Then why are you protecting him?

268
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,239
You told me that I would see
Correction used as a force for good.

269
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,139
I've seen it used to help
people like Napier and Knox.

270
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,339
I was as appalled as you to discover
Frank was involved in this.

271
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,219
But there's a difference
between the aims of an operation

272
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,469
and the running of it.

273
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,109
Whatever it is, it makes
you complicit in the murders

274
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,019
of five innocent people...

275
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,500
I would never sanction the killing
of a British national.

276
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:09,989
...complicit in the cover-up...

277
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,630
The two things are not the same!

278
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,620
Explain the difference to a judge.

279
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:15,109
You really want to know?

280
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,549
My intervention into this shit storm

281
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,750
prevented British killings -
specifically...

282
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:22,080
...yours.

283
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,490
Don't do it!

284
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,160
Everything all right?

285
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,339
You don't seem on the precipice
of a new dawn.

286
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,690
You have it?

287
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,599
Needs a code. And you shall have it
upon completion of your work.

288
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,009
Brains on your flooring
is not complete enough for you?

289
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,049
That isn't funny, Frank.
I've had nightmares.

290
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,809
I thought you were coming
to deal with her,

291
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,849
not settle your internal affairs in
my corridor. They're cleaning it up!

292
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,009
I've got journos sniffing
around the building,

293
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,579
and not the kind I like.

294
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,929
Rumours of another
armed attack in London.

295
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,009
The story needs wrapping up.

296
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,930
No loose threads.

297
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,150
Well...

298
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,390
Again, I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

299
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,989
Consider this the sort of thing
you might learn from me

300
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,669
if you could bear to give me
your trust, instead of constantly

301
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,630
trying to betray me.

302
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,790
When the police uncover
a conspiracy, they make arrests.

303
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,299
A spy...

304
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,669
...flips it.

305
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,310
Keeps it running to their advantage.

306
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,189
I confirmed Frank Napier's
involvement in this

307
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,560
not 36 hours ago...

308
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,420
...when he came to me
in a sharing mood.

309
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:12,229
His gunmen were outside your flat,

310
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,709
waiting for his order.

311
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,469
You caught one of them on camera,

312
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,110
of course you were going to be next
on Frank Napier's kill list.

313
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,220
Until you stopped him.

314
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,630
Until I persuaded him

315
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,660
to let me take the reins.

316
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,189
How did...?

317
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,621
Let's just say I mediated
a crisis of moral leadership.

318
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,700
So...

319
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,521
...I'm sorry if you disapprove
of my joining the operation.

320
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,020
But if I hadn't...

321
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,469
The door to this opportunity
will not stay open long, Rachel.

322
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,909
I suggest you take advantage
before it shuts.

323
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,640
Give me everything you have

324
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:04,659
on Correction,

325
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,189
tell me who you're working with...

326
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,391
...and we'll find a way to move on.

327
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,890
And if I don't?

328
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:19,600
SHE SIGHS

329
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,840
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

330
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,910
I thought you might ask that.

331
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:29,480
Phillips.

332
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,850
I'd brace yourself for this,
if I were you.

333
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,969
Simone Turner is at Security.
Why?

334
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,119
Isaac's not here.
She's asking for you.

335
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,511
OK.

336
00:20:57,531 --> 00:21:00,380
GARLAND: I wonder if you'd be quite
so determined to fight Correction

337
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:02,670
if you saw what it was capable of.

338
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,400
I, Rachel Carey, am currently
within the legal jurisdiction

339
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,429
of the Russian Federation.

340
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,299
I have been offered safe
harbour by the Russian state

341
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,060
and I have accepted.

342
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,870
Make that "safe harbour
and protection".

343
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,309
I have been offered safe harbour
and protection by the Russian state

344
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,429
and I have accepted.

345
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,749
"Gratefully accepted"?

346
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,430
Sounds good to me.

347
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,989
VIDEO: And I have
gratefully accepted.

348
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,019
This is the program
used on Isaac Turner.

349
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,099
I forgot to mention the other perk
of joining the operation.

350
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,150
I have control of the kit.

351
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,239
Do you feel guilty
for your betrayal, DCI Carey?

352
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,800
TYPING

353
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,469
I do.

354
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,641
I deeply, deeply regret
what I've done.

355
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,391
You can't win, Rachel.

356
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,590
Surely you can see that.

357
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,109
Have you read the Home Office
whistle-blower's claims, Mr Turner?

358
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,640
You know, Ralph, today's meant to
be about these young people

359
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:48,870
trying to achieve their goals.

360
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,110
CHEERING

361
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,239
OK, fine people of the press,

362
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,279
if you'd care to decamp
to the hospitality suite,

363
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,079
Mr Turner will join presently

364
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,599
to answer any related questions
you have.

365
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,510
Let's keep them related, please.

366
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,199
All righty.

367
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,869
Hi, darling.

368
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,959
Are you OK?

369
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,249
What are you...?

370
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,189
Wait. How... How did you
even know I'd be here?

371
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,200
You've been tweeting about it
all morning.

372
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,359
What's up?

373
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,119
I went to see Aliza.

374
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,999
Aliza? Why did you do that?

375
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,189
I thought I might get somewhere.

376
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,640
Somewhere with...?

377
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:38,680
The question no-one seems
inclined to answer.

378
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,359
We good?

379
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,289
Erm, just a second.

380
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,650
If Victoria Bello was lying,
why was her application obstructed

381
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:47,999
by the Home Office?

382
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,699
Oh, right. You know, I've actually
been looking into that.

383
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,919
I managed to collar
the Home Secretary about it.

384
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,099
You can stop, Isaac. Aliza obviously
knows you better than I do.

385
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,669
It seems the whole
of Westminster does.

386
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,549
Simmy...
Why did they assume it was true?

387
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,019
Erm... probably because they judge me

388
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,159
by the same pathetically low
standards as the rest of them.

389
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,879
The Palace of Westminster

390
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,289
is basically a midlife crisis
support centre.

391
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,769
"I was away from home." Go on.

392
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,549
You know, "I was away from home.
It was an emotional time. She's..."

393
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,289
She's a good-looking girl.

394
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,559
Yes, I suppose. Woman.

395
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,299
You were in a mood with me.

396
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,259
I was in a mood...?

397
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,660
It was my mother's funeral.

398
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:29,839
Yes, I was upset.
- I needed support.

399
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,930
And Victoria Bello gave you some.

400
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,870
No.

401
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,739
Swear on the children.

402
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,719
Swe...? What?

403
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,099
I need to shake
this lingering doubt, Isaac.

404
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,329
You know, I am in the middle
of a press conference.

405
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,531
Swear on the children
none of it's true.

406
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,849
Uh...

407
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,249
OK. OK.

408
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,209
Erm... I swear.

409
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,969
I swear...

410
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,979
...on the children, on us,
on everything I hold dear...

411
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,330
...Victoria Bello's claim was false.

412
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,400
Her son's not mine.

413
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:07,090
Obviously.

414
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,930
You... didn't submit a sample,
did you?

415
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,521
For the paternity test?

416
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,659
It's a simple question, Isaac.

417
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,531
Did you submit
a sample of your DNA?

418
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,489
No.

419
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,739
So, they faked the result on TV,
like you said they would?

420
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,129
No. The result was negative.

421
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,379
A fake result
would have been positive.

422
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,920
So... it's only fake
if you disagree with it?

423
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,929
I'm not the father of that kid,
Simone. Everyone knows that.

424
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,329
Everyone knows it
because it's on the news. Yes.

425
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,819
You told me not to trust the news.

426
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,019
How are we doing, guys? OK.

427
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,639
You... You can trust the news,
Simone.

428
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,139
Why would you say I couldn't?

429
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,969
I... I was confused.

430
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,129
Confused? Need another minute?

431
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,559
What about those
racial profiling comments?

432
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,739
OK...

433
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,089
What about them?
Were you confused then?

434
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,249
Erm... yes.

435
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,839
Confused when you made them,

436
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,490
or confused when you told me
you didn't make them?

437
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,329
Jesus, Isaac! Do you even know?

438
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,530
The confusion is pretty
non-fucking-stop, Simone.

439
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:25,489
But now... now... things are good.

440
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,209
Things are going our way. So you
don't need to keep asking questions

441
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,639
and picking everything apart.

442
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,259
Oh, but I do, Isaac, because
I need to get to the truth.

443
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,769
And right now,
I'm nowhere fucking near it!

444
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,559
How do I know nothing happened
between you and that woman?

445
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,999
Because you just heard me
swear it on our kids' lives!

446
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,199
But that's... that's not quite what
you said, though, is it?

447
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,159
You thought I wouldn't notice.

448
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,829
Oh, my. You have lost me.

449
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,609
Do you think I'm stupid?

450
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,359
No. I've been around
politicians too long.

451
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,719
OK, what did I say, then? You said
Victoria Bello's claim was untrue.

452
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,280
Yes. And that her son's not yours.
Which he isn't.

453
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,890
But you didn't say nothing happened.

454
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:08,169
How do you know her son's
not yours, Isaac?

455
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,449
If there's no paternity test.

456
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:15,200
Is it because you didn't fuck
her or because you used protection?

457
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,769
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
Erm... Isaac.

458
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,199
Just fucking wait! No, it's OK.

459
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,969
I came for the truth, I think I've
seen it. Listen... You know...

460
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,660
You know condoms aren't 100%.

461
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,560
Do you realise that?

462
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:54,609
Isaac Turner and I discovered
a shared interest in exposing

463
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,740
Correction, an interest the MP
no longer appears to share.

464
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,359
Khadija Khan became aware of
Correction

465
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,000
after the hack on the studio.

466
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,990
Because you enlightened her.

467
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:15,281
I saw an ally in blowing
the whistle, yes.

468
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,059
Does Khan have your dossier?

469
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,551
No, sir.

470
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,319
I was concerned she'd broadcast
before I gained enough evidence.

471
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,869
I decided not to share it.

472
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,860
She knows about Correction.

473
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,810
I mean... What?

474
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,809
All Khadija Khan seems
to care about is Khadija Khan,

475
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,339
getting her claws into the next
exclusive.

476
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,530
She knew that interview
with Victoria Bello

477
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,480
would mean losing Isaac's trust.
She couldn't help herself.

478
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,141
Isaac Turner doesn't trust Khan?

479
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,860
Erm... there's something else,
ma'am.

480
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,319
You'll find copies of all the files
in my dossier on SD cards hidden

481
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,521
beneath the radio in my car.

482
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,190
PHONE RINGS

483
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:48,431
Jen. Anthony.

484
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,509
I'm calling for a favour.

485
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,990
Right. Well, you know me.

486
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,350
You're retiring, I hear.

487
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,709
Spend more time with the family,

488
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,630
or can't take any more guilt?

489
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,479
We need you to provide a statement.

490
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,510
About the dossier.

491
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,281
About Vanguard.

492
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,239
As sole witness to
last night's events,

493
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,200
your testimony is critical.

494
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:39,069
You were following up on a routine
inquiry in the offices

495
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,969
of Truro Analytics when you became
aware of intruders in the building.

496
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:47,799
Your priority then became the safety
of their assumed target -

497
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,080
Mr Gregory Knox.

498
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,429
Shortly after securing Mr Knox
in his office, armed support arrived

499
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,709
to neutralise the threat.
Due to their ongoing deployment

500
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,119
on covert operations,

501
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,400
the identities of the armed officers
will be redacted from your report.

502
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:08,239
However, you can confirm
the identity of the man fatally

503
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,760
wounded at the scene...

504
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,870
...as that of Nikolai Mirsky...

505
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:18,049
...a Russian national and the prime
suspect in the murders

506
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,839
of Edison Yao and Joseph Mwangi,

507
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,920
Jason McKenna, Lee Bradbury...

508
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,880
...and Patrick Flynn.

509
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,930
Surprised you didn't just fake
the signature.

510
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,199
You're not concerned about
the fallout from Moscow?

511
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,769
Moscow will deny it,

512
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,929
but they won't disprove it.

513
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,150
I prefer it that way...

514
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:47,000
...no-one knowing what to believe.

515
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,999
Sir, I understand that you are
asking me to comply with a

516
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,570
false-flag op to protect Frank
Napier and Gregory Knox. I just...

517
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,800
I'd just like to know why.

518
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,769
You hear that prick? Hands me the
drive,

519
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,769
tells me I've got to wait
for the code.

520
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,150
Yes, I can believe it.

521
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:17,490
Get me into this.

522
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,510
Knox is the prick.

523
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,509
You're kind of hard to get rid of,
aren't you?

524
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,869
Like a stubborn turd -
just won't flush.

525
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,849
Why don't you brief Rachel
on the contents of that drive?

526
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,839
Is that an order?

527
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,050
Yeah.

528
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,400
Greg Knox may be a piece of shit,
but he crunches data for every big

529
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,879
tech company that matters.
Know how long we've been trying

530
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,959
to make a deal with somebody
like that?

531
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,150
What kind of deal?

532
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:55,410
I helped him play puppet master
to his politician.

533
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:58,679
For that, he gave me the secret
weapon -

534
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,199
Truro's algorithm.

535
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,759
Access to almost 3 billion
social media accounts worldwide.

536
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,129
So you can track the activity
of just about anyone?

537
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,880
Not track - predict.

538
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:19,049
The algorithm calculates behaviour
right down to how suggestible a guy

539
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:23,049
is to changing his toothpaste
or who he's going to vote for.

540
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,589
You can also predict how prone he
is to dissent.

541
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:31,519
Anyone from Bangkok to Mexico City
to Portland, Oregon

542
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,949
even thinks about subversion,
we'll know about it.

543
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,319
Not if we can't access the drive,
we won't.

544
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,879
What am I looking at?

545
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,079
Well, you're looking at it -
I just can't transfer it.

546
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,009
You mean you can get into the BBC
but you can't hack into this?

547
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,239
This has AES 256-bit cipher.

548
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,239
I can hack it,
if you want to lose data.

549
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,640
Why won't Knox give you the code?

550
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,120
He's not happy with the work...

551
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,530
...carnage...

552
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,310
...the trail of bodies.

553
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:09,009
He's concerned it might all
lead back to him, right?

554
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,449
Right.

555
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,999
He'll give me the code -

556
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,720
when everybody is looking
the other way.

557
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,970
East.

558
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,650
Good work, Rachel.

559
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,940
A landmark move for global
security, if not democracy.

560
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,369
Have you forgotten already?

561
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,520
What did I teach you about flipping
an operation to our advantage?

562
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,170
The room's yours, Todd.

563
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:27,209
Rachel and I are stepping
out for a while.

564
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,369
Where are we going, ma'am?

565
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:33,329
You heard Frank. Gregory Knox
is trying to plant a politician

566
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,959
who answers to big tech.

567
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,291
We are going to stop him.

568
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,329
Can I get a very weak Earl Grey
with lots of milk?

569
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,480
How's the all-seeing Al, Gregory?

570
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,499
The great and powerful program me.

571
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,959
Is there a problem?

572
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,569
Erm... a slight problem, yes.

573
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,849
It seems I've hit a slight bump
in the road

574
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,129
that your algorithm
failed to predict.

575
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,729
Simone says she's going to fucking
leave me. Already?

576
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,239
Al...? What?

577
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,609
Ah, right.

578
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,929
HE SIGHS Wow,

579
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,329
You... You don't seem too alarmed.

580
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,300
I can't imagine your algorithm's
going to love my chances of success

581
00:36:14,301 --> 00:36:15,679
if I end up getting divorced.

582
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,170
You can never second guess
that thing. So what?

583
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:21,369
We might not have a problem
if someone does, in fact, leave me?

584
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,890
Not necessarily.

585
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,181
You knew? Hmm?

586
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,729
You knew. You knew.

587
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,040
You knew dragging Victoria Bello
out the woodwork

588
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:38,249
would destroy my marriage.
No, I knew it... it might.

589
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,209
It...? What the fuck?

590
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,929
Isaac, you told us when we first
met you wanted to get to the top.

591
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,569
Not if it meant losing my family.

592
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,689
You didn't stipulate that.
Are you insane?

593
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:50,740
I'm sorry, Isaac, but the program
just doesn't see you with Simone.

594
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,729
A significant percentage
of the electorate perceives

595
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,290
your marriage as somewhat strategic
and they don't like it.

596
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,529
Do you really think it's the first
time I've heard that -

597
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,939
that I married
Simone to climb the ladder?

598
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,819
I've had it thrown at me
for 13 years.

599
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,170
So if you really think
I'm going to give in to it now,

600
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:13,609
you and your algorithm can both
go fuck yourselves.

601
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,369
It's bullshit. It's what people
think.

602
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,249
Then why don't you change
what they think?

603
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,739
I thought that was your job.
My job is to get you into power.

604
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,530
Your job is to change the world
when you get there.

605
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,300
Ah, gentlemen.

606
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:31,659
Guess which swinging dick
of broadcasting

607
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,679
I've just got off the phone to -
Anthony Reed OBE.

608
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,620
He's offering an exclusive interview
- Thursday night, 8pm, BBC One.

609
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,181
Shall we pencil it?

610
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,250
DOOR OPENS

611
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,019
DOOR CLOSES

612
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,370
What about the boy?

613
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,559
The boy?

614
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,339
Amandi.

615
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,900
Victoria's son?

616
00:38:28,301 --> 00:38:32,959
Seeing as you seem to know so much,
I thought you might oblige me.

617
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,840
What about?

618
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,539
Is he...?

619
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,850
Yours?

620
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,540
Heavens, I have no idea.

621
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,920
There are some details,
Isaac, even I'm not privy to.

622
00:38:55,921 --> 00:39:00,340
Weak Earl Grey with
lots of milk. Ah, perfect.

623
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,460
Erm, are we...?

624
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,759
Meeting Khadija Khan.

625
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,809
If you're hoping to flip
Khadija, ma'am,

626
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,739
I'm the wrong person to take with
you.

627
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,438
We didn't end on good terms.
I know.

628
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:28,138
I deployed someone to keep
track of your movements

629
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,607
while Vanguard was down.

630
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:31,899
I imagine this is going to be pretty
awkward for you, huh?

631
00:39:34,149 --> 00:39:36,377
I find myself with a problem.

632
00:39:36,378 --> 00:39:41,737
Some highly classified intelligence
has recently been disclosed to you.

633
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:44,937
I trust DCI Carey's presence leaves
you in no doubt

634
00:39:44,938 --> 00:39:47,587
as to what
intelligence I am referring.

635
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:49,967
As DCI Carey will confirm,

636
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:54,937
this serious breach coincided with
a period of personal difficulty

637
00:39:54,938 --> 00:39:57,427
for the detective, which she now

638
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:01,187
recognises impacted negatively
on her mental health and well being,

639
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:04,388
in particular her behaviour
in the workplace.

640
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:07,898
Forgive me if I'm speaking
out of turn.

641
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:11,937
No. I can confirm all of that.

642
00:40:11,938 --> 00:40:15,107
It explains the public outburst.

643
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:18,898
Last person who yelled at me like
that's now editing the One Show.

644
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:22,617
So, I realise I need something
solid on the table

645
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:25,787
if I'm to earn your cooperation.

646
00:40:25,788 --> 00:40:30,028
The service has long enjoyed
a mutually beneficial relationship

647
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:33,868
with one trusted individual
inside this organisation.

648
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:38,097
The incumbent isn't getting
any younger.

649
00:40:38,098 --> 00:40:39,667
Anthony Reed?

650
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,387
He's a fucking spook?

651
00:40:41,388 --> 00:40:44,817
In some ways, you're better
informed than him already,

652
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:47,898
and I'll wager we can agree
on one operational goal

653
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:49,387
in the immediate term.

654
00:40:49,388 --> 00:40:51,547
Sorry, are you tapping me up?

655
00:40:51,548 --> 00:40:55,667
There's no official contract,
no financial agreement.

656
00:40:55,668 --> 00:41:00,107
Your reward will be doing your bit
for national security

657
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:02,977
and in the bountiful source
of information that will become

658
00:41:02,978 --> 00:41:07,867
available to you from the all-seeing
eye of British intelligence -

659
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,698
directly and exclusively...

660
00:41:11,578 --> 00:41:13,019
...to you.

661
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:18,818
What operational goal?

662
00:41:23,228 --> 00:41:27,657
Today brings to an end a highly
sophisticated campaign of targeted

663
00:41:27,658 --> 00:41:31,207
gun violence that has gripped
counter-terrorism

664
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,738
command for six long days.

665
00:41:35,648 --> 00:41:38,087
A devastating campaign
that has claimed the lives

666
00:41:38,088 --> 00:41:40,927
of five innocent victims -

667
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:44,207
three of which were serving
police officers.

668
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:48,977
The manhunt was concluded in a
stand off during which a 39-year-old

669
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:52,817
white male was fatally wounded by
firearms officers.

670
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:58,637
The identity of the individual has
been confirmed as Nikolai Mirsky,

671
00:41:58,638 --> 00:42:03,898
a Russian national and the prime
suspect in our investigation.

672
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:12,107
Our assessment of the motive
for these attacks continues,

673
00:42:12,108 --> 00:42:14,917
but the evidence overwhelmingly
indicates

674
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:17,748
the involvement of agents
of a foreign state.

675
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:27,167
I would like to pay a heartfelt
tribute to those officers who made

676
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:28,827
the ultimate sacrifice...

677
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:36,247
...giving up their lives...

678
00:42:38,397 --> 00:42:40,707
...in the service of protecting us.

679
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,596
I did say you should give
her a call.

680
00:43:02,597 --> 00:43:04,237
You did, ma'am, yes.

681
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:09,637
It's Rachel, isn't it?

682
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:14,607
Yvonne, I'm so, so sorry
for your loss.

683
00:43:16,077 --> 00:43:19,186
They told me you were there
when it happened.

684
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:21,037
I...

685
00:43:21,038 --> 00:43:23,886
I was the first to reach the ward
the night of the attack,

686
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:26,526
but, by the time I got to Patrick...

687
00:43:26,527 --> 00:43:30,247
I'm not talking about Patrick.
I'm talking about the Russian.

688
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:34,407
You were there when they killed him.

689
00:43:36,177 --> 00:43:37,337
Yes.

690
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:43,837
Thank you.

691
00:43:53,928 --> 00:43:56,426
You're coming down the Crown,
Carey.

692
00:43:56,427 --> 00:43:58,956
You're not putting your hand
in your pocket all night.

693
00:43:58,957 --> 00:44:00,836
SHE SIGHS I don't think so.

694
00:44:00,837 --> 00:44:04,127
You're the hero of Vanguard.
We're not going without you.

695
00:44:10,287 --> 00:44:11,547
Perhaps you ought to...

696
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,407
...hero.

697
00:45:34,846 --> 00:45:37,275
Abi. I was seriously thinking
about checking the news

698
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,325
to see if you'd been found
in a ditch somewhere.

699
00:45:39,326 --> 00:45:41,556
Sorry. Shit sister.

700
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:45,945
Was that all right the other day?

701
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:47,027
The laptop?

702
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,846
Did I do it right?

703
00:45:51,596 --> 00:45:53,047
Yeah, Abi.

704
00:45:54,426 --> 00:45:56,056
You did it just right.

705
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:00,125
I've got to go.

706
00:46:00,126 --> 00:46:01,356
Big day tomorrow.

707
00:46:08,486 --> 00:46:10,815
Should he stay or should he go?

708
00:46:10,816 --> 00:46:14,916
As Gill fights for his political
life, the security minister who saw

709
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:18,595
the Home Office crisis from inside
could deliver the decisive blow.

710
00:46:18,596 --> 00:46:22,745
Join me for an exclusive interview
with Isaac Turner,

711
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,675
tonight live on BBC One.

712
00:46:24,676 --> 00:46:25,825
Home Office.

713
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:27,386
Home truths.

714
00:47:14,596 --> 00:47:16,565
Right. So, first-hand knowledge,

715
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:20,056
Gill obstructed Victoria Bello's
application.

716
00:47:20,057 --> 00:47:22,725
Fast-tracked his housekeeper's
visa, his wife's

717
00:47:22,726 --> 00:47:25,125
cousin's passport application.

718
00:47:25,126 --> 00:47:27,725
Yes, I know. We've been over this.

719
00:47:27,726 --> 00:47:31,205
Well, Gregory would like us
to run over it again.

720
00:47:31,206 --> 00:47:33,125
HE SIGHS

721
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:35,235
Where's Reed?
PHONE BEEPS

722
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:36,445
Oh, shit.

723
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:40,065
"Apologies for the hold up,
nanoseconds away, Anthony."

724
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:43,466
We're ready to line up when you
are, Mr Turner.

725
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:56,206
Here's your water, Mr Turner.
Thank you.

726
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:00,667
Just going to mic you up.

727
00:48:04,996 --> 00:48:07,125
Intercept in six minutes.

728
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:09,875
Camera feed secure.
Video capture in progress.

729
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:11,776
Bring it up.

730
00:48:23,856 --> 00:48:26,146
I still remember my first time.

731
00:48:29,646 --> 00:48:32,115
Can I just check the level
on that mic?

732
00:48:32,116 --> 00:48:35,735
What did you have for breakfast?
Er, eggs, toast.

733
00:48:35,736 --> 00:48:39,215
Coffee? Perfect. Caviar.
Where... Where is Reed?

734
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,786
Zac, catch me.
I'm parachuting in.

735
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:45,705
You're... You're not Anthony Reed.
Well, thanks.

736
00:48:45,706 --> 00:48:49,425
You're not the Prime Minister,
but we play the hands we're dealt.

737
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,025
Anthony sends his apologies.
Family matter.

738
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:54,556
I have my theories.

739
00:48:56,076 --> 00:48:59,145
Bollocks. I'm pulling it.
What? Why? Let's go.

740
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:01,195
I should really call the office.

741
00:49:01,196 --> 00:49:03,787
You don't need to call the office,
I'm pulling it.

742
00:49:04,986 --> 00:49:07,185
The interview's been trailed, mate.
Yeah, not with her

743
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:09,276
asking the questions, it hasn't. Oh!

744
00:49:11,646 --> 00:49:13,086
Isaac.

745
00:49:24,556 --> 00:49:29,425
Isaac. You really want to make
this decision - unilaterally?

746
00:49:29,426 --> 00:49:31,945
Rhys, remind me - who do you work
for?

747
00:49:31,946 --> 00:49:34,735
No, it's not a trick question
or a difficult one.

748
00:49:34,736 --> 00:49:37,545
You work for me, but if you'd rather
work for someone else, please,

749
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:39,316
by all means, fuck off!

750
00:49:40,376 --> 00:49:41,667
Isaac.

751
00:49:47,436 --> 00:49:50,195
Clear set. Strike this please, Mel.
Thank you. Take water.

752
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,797
Let's get her mic'd up.

753
00:49:52,917 --> 00:49:54,626
Intercept in four minutes.

754
00:49:57,276 --> 00:49:58,875
Thank you.

755
00:49:58,876 --> 00:50:01,025
Come right in.
Right over here.

756
00:50:01,026 --> 00:50:03,145
Digital asset rendering.

757
00:50:03,146 --> 00:50:06,556
Billy?
Do you have a mirror, please?

758
00:50:07,996 --> 00:50:10,225
Check the batteries on that.
Yeah? Good?

759
00:50:10,226 --> 00:50:12,155
Where... Where is Reed?

760
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:14,995
What did you have for breakfast?
I had some porridge.

761
00:50:14,996 --> 00:50:17,865
Bollocks. Got enough?

762
00:50:17,866 --> 00:50:22,156
More than enough.
Digital assets standing by.

763
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:27,866
PHONE RINGS OUT

764
00:50:33,946 --> 00:50:38,026
Hello. So, listen, I've pulled
the interview.

765
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:42,716
What? 20 seconds to transmission.

766
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:46,186
Deploy the asset.

767
00:50:53,996 --> 00:50:57,025
ANNOUNCER: Time for some home truths
now on BBC One.

768
00:50:57,026 --> 00:50:59,465
In an update to our advertised
program me...

769
00:50:59,466 --> 00:51:01,275
Anthony Reed never showed.

770
00:51:01,276 --> 00:51:05,106
Khadija Khan turned up at the last
minute. Something's not quite right.

771
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:10,985
...an exclusive live interview
with the MP on everybody's mind.

772
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:12,815
You've pulled the interview?

773
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:15,185
Yes. I walked.

774
00:51:15,186 --> 00:51:17,916
The truth is coming.

775
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:21,185
And when it comes, you'll know
about it, believe me.

776
00:51:21,186 --> 00:51:23,635
PROGRAMME VOICE OVER: If proof were
ever needed that a week

777
00:51:23,636 --> 00:51:25,355
is a long time in politics,

778
00:51:25,356 --> 00:51:28,305
hit replay on Zac Turner's.
In just seven days...

779
00:51:28,306 --> 00:51:31,715
60 seconds to intercept.
60 seconds to... Digital asset

780
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:34,225
standing by. Digital asset
standing by.

781
00:51:34,226 --> 00:51:37,145
...a Home Office scandal worthy
of soap opera. We don't have to...

782
00:51:37,146 --> 00:51:39,676
No, no, it's fine.
The latest twist has seen Zac

783
00:51:39,677 --> 00:51:41,945
strike back with the help
of a Home Office

784
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:46,796
whistle-blower and a dossier of
dirt on his former boss, Rowan Gill.

785
00:51:46,797 --> 00:51:48,075
Mother fuck you all!

786
00:51:48,076 --> 00:51:52,656
Tonight, in an exclusive interview
live from London, we hear from

787
00:51:52,657 --> 00:51:54,635
Isaac Turner... 30 seconds to
intercept.

788
00:51:54,636 --> 00:51:58,515
Eyeline check... about the most
controversial week of his career,

789
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:01,425
his own political ambitions...
Khadija.

790
00:52:01,426 --> 00:52:04,225
...and who he believes should
take the hit...

791
00:52:04,226 --> 00:52:06,185
How's that? Eyeline set.
Clear frame.

792
00:52:06,186 --> 00:52:09,185
Clear frame.
..for the crisis at the Home Office.

793
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:11,586
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY

794
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:15,156
Is she going to be all right?

795
00:52:19,826 --> 00:52:21,547
I hope you know what you're doing.

796
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:25,235
I'm heading back to you right now.
But, listen,

797
00:52:25,236 --> 00:52:26,455
the two of us need to talk.

798
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:30,225
Intercept in six, five, four...

799
00:52:30,226 --> 00:52:33,796
Things have got to be different, OK?
From now on,

800
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:36,667
I want to be involved in every
decision.

801
00:52:41,797 --> 00:52:44,435
OK?

802
00:52:44,436 --> 00:52:47,025
Gregory? You walked.

803
00:52:47,026 --> 00:52:48,547
Yes.

804
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:54,386
Intercept is live.
Intercept is live.

805
00:52:56,516 --> 00:53:00,456
Was the wrong man fired
from the Home Office this week?

806
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,995
If you're referring to my erstwhile
colleague, the Home Secretary,

807
00:53:13,996 --> 00:53:16,625
it's not my call to make.
I'm not the Prime Minister.

808
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,676
If the rumours in Westminster
are to be believed,

809
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:22,025
you'd like to be. Oh-ho,
in Westminster's a big if.

810
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:23,905
It's not a denial, then?

811
00:53:23,906 --> 00:53:26,666
After the week I've had, Khadija,
I think it'd be unwise for me

812
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:29,475
to launch a bid for Number 10.
ON PHONE: Gregory? Hello?

813
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:31,906
Just the Home Office?
Who is this?

814
00:53:33,466 --> 00:53:35,185
Erm...

815
00:53:35,186 --> 00:53:37,625
Gregory, it's...

816
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:40,596
...it's me.
CALL-END ALERT

817
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:49,596
You said no more deep fakes.

818
00:53:58,316 --> 00:54:01,955
Britain deserves a Home Office
that's fit for purpose.

819
00:54:01,956 --> 00:54:03,755
PHONE RINGS
I tried to stop them.

820
00:54:03,756 --> 00:54:06,475
I really tried. Is it fucking him?

821
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:09,265
Is what fucking him?
Britain deserves a Home Secretary

822
00:54:09,266 --> 00:54:12,315
who's up to the job.

823
00:54:12,316 --> 00:54:14,985
Ah... I don't know what this is.
Right. By up to the job,

824
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:17,915
I don't mean scurrying around
SW1A getting caught up

825
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:19,515
in allegations of misconduct.

826
00:54:19,516 --> 00:54:20,875
He's doing OK.

827
00:54:20,876 --> 00:54:23,275
I mean rising above the
Westminster... Gregory? Sh!

828
00:54:23,276 --> 00:54:26,755
...bubble to confront every threat
to British democracy head-on.

829
00:54:26,756 --> 00:54:29,235
But, Greg... Gregory.
It's not him.

830
00:54:29,236 --> 00:54:31,155
Erm, excuse me.
Can you turn around?

831
00:54:31,156 --> 00:54:33,436
I need to go back to the hotel.

832
00:54:34,516 --> 00:54:36,105
Erm...

833
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,316
Hello. Excuse me.

834
00:54:39,396 --> 00:54:42,086
Driver! Hello!

835
00:54:43,677 --> 00:54:46,595
Are you suggesting there
are threats to British democracy

836
00:54:46,596 --> 00:54:50,475
not being confronted?
I'm not suggesting it, Khadija,

837
00:54:50,476 --> 00:54:52,745
I'm saying it loud and clear.

838
00:54:52,746 --> 00:54:55,465
Can you indicate the nature
of some of those threats?

839
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:56,906
Two words...

840
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,515
...big tech.

841
00:55:01,516 --> 00:55:03,915
What?!
KHADIJA: Big tech?

842
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:07,445
Whatever Gregory Knox is paying you,
it's not going to be worth the hell

843
00:55:07,446 --> 00:55:10,845
I'm going to unleash if you
don't turn this fucking car around!

844
00:55:10,846 --> 00:55:14,235
We all know the extent
to which technology and social media

845
00:55:14,236 --> 00:55:16,345
has infiltrated our daily lives.

846
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,465
It's in our homes,
it's on our screens.

847
00:55:18,466 --> 00:55:20,475
It's got our children hooked.

848
00:55:20,476 --> 00:55:23,395
I dare say I'm not the only dad
in the country who regrets giving in

849
00:55:23,396 --> 00:55:25,885
to their daughter's demands
for a smart phone.

850
00:55:25,886 --> 00:55:27,075
Nice detail

851
00:55:27,076 --> 00:55:29,965
But it's also infiltrated
our political systems -

852
00:55:29,966 --> 00:55:33,676
not just in Britain, but around
the world. Infiltrated how?

853
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:38,325
By harvesting our data without our
consent and using it to interfere

854
00:55:38,326 --> 00:55:41,556
with elections, referendums,
political campaigns.

855
00:55:41,557 --> 00:55:44,035
You're saying that tech
corporations are meddling

856
00:55:44,036 --> 00:55:46,115
in UK politics directly?

857
00:55:46,116 --> 00:55:47,686
Well, not directly.

858
00:55:47,687 --> 00:55:51,875
The dirty work tends to be done
by data analytics companies

859
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:53,605
outside of Silicon Valley. Shit!

860
00:55:53,606 --> 00:55:55,475
Here in the UK, for instance?

861
00:55:55,476 --> 00:56:00,116
I can think of one such
example here in the UK, yes.

862
00:56:02,116 --> 00:56:03,525
Frank, is this you?

863
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,806
What the fuck are you doing to me?!

864
00:56:05,807 --> 00:56:07,797
How much of this is illegal?

865
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:11,806
Well, we've seen how nimble
these guys can be when it comes

866
00:56:11,807 --> 00:56:14,035
to dancing around tax laws.

867
00:56:14,036 --> 00:56:18,315
Clearly, Khadija, if a plot
to affect British democracy

868
00:56:18,316 --> 00:56:21,265
was directed by a member
of a foreign state,

869
00:56:21,266 --> 00:56:24,075
that's a serious
international incident.

870
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:26,595
If a British national is found to
have colluded in such

871
00:56:26,596 --> 00:56:28,557
an attempt, that's treason.

872
00:56:31,246 --> 00:56:32,677
Holy shit!

873
00:56:33,986 --> 00:56:35,836
Is he fleeing already?

874
00:56:40,626 --> 00:56:42,835
My money's on Ecuador.

875
00:56:42,836 --> 00:56:46,556
Do you see any hope of holding them
to account? Not as things stand.

876
00:56:46,557 --> 00:56:49,705
Tech giants behave as if they're
untouchable.

877
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,405
Britain needs a Home Secretary -
indeed, a Prime Minister - who

878
00:56:52,406 --> 00:56:55,195
isn't afraid to tell them
otherwise.

879
00:56:55,196 --> 00:56:57,765
What do you mean, none?
How's that possible?

880
00:56:57,766 --> 00:57:00,715
ON PHONE: We knew it was going to be
inconclusive until we received

881
00:57:00,716 --> 00:57:02,125
the results of the biopsy.

882
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:06,285
So, from riddled to all clear?

883
00:57:06,286 --> 00:57:08,915
I agree it's unusual.

884
00:57:08,916 --> 00:57:14,155
Erm, CT imaging throws up anomalies
from time to time,

885
00:57:14,156 --> 00:57:16,246
but rarely this inconsistent.

886
00:57:17,356 --> 00:57:19,645
You'll have to come
in for a biopsy. Wait a second.

887
00:57:19,646 --> 00:57:23,075
These images
you've been showing me -

888
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:25,195
black tar covering
all my internal organs -

889
00:57:25,196 --> 00:57:28,035
did you receive
those electronically?

890
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:30,915
It's all electronic. By email?

891
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:34,046
Uploaded to the hospital servers.
I get it from there.

892
00:57:38,687 --> 00:57:40,125
Motherfucker.

893
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:43,765
Alarmingly, the tech industry
has done absolutely nothing

894
00:57:43,766 --> 00:57:46,245
to combat the issue of election
interference.

895
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:48,195
And, frankly, one has to ask why.

896
00:57:48,196 --> 00:57:52,475
In fact, one has to wonder what
such corporations have to gain.

897
00:57:52,476 --> 00:57:56,166
If I'm not mistaken, DCI Carey,
you appear to be enjoying this.

898
00:57:59,356 --> 00:58:01,845
Gregory Knox's
plan has been sabotaged.

899
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:05,045
An attack on British democracy
has been averted.

900
00:58:05,046 --> 00:58:07,705
Thanks to your work in particular,
DS Flynn's family

901
00:58:07,706 --> 00:58:10,406
feel a strong sense of justice
for Patrick.

902
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:16,835
Are you starting to see the
potential for good in this strange

903
00:58:16,836 --> 00:58:19,276
little program me we call
Correction?

904
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:31,645
Frank!

905
00:58:31,646 --> 00:58:33,645
Are you OK?

906
00:58:33,646 --> 00:58:35,365
Never better.

907
00:58:35,366 --> 00:58:37,436
Fit as a mule, apparently.

908
00:58:37,437 --> 00:58:42,866
I mean, doctor says I may be looking
at a benign stomach ulcer, but...

909
00:58:46,286 --> 00:58:47,916
You mean...? Hm?

910
00:58:49,156 --> 00:58:50,926
Biopsy report came back.

911
00:58:52,236 --> 00:58:53,716
I don't have cancer.

912
00:58:55,386 --> 00:58:57,625
But that's... incredible.

913
00:58:57,626 --> 00:58:59,795
It is incredible,

914
00:58:59,796 --> 00:59:02,485
when you consider that,
just the other day, my CT scan

915
00:59:02,486 --> 00:59:05,125
indicated I was riddled with it.
It doesn't make sense.

916
00:59:05,126 --> 00:59:07,205
That's right after I told
you how sick I was.

917
00:59:07,206 --> 00:59:09,645
You need to go in for some more
tests. What the fuck did you do?

918
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,225
What did I do?
Don't fucking lie to me.

919
00:59:11,226 --> 00:59:13,205
Frank, I have no idea what
you're talking...

920
00:59:13,206 --> 00:59:15,795
I know you're behind this.
You're obviously very upset.

921
00:59:15,796 --> 00:59:18,925
All that talk about redemption,
about Sunday School.

922
00:59:18,926 --> 00:59:20,655
You wanted my fucking op,
didn't you?

923
00:59:20,656 --> 00:59:23,205
Well, something had to be done
after the shit shower

924
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:26,005
you made of it!
Are you out of your fucking mind?

925
00:59:26,006 --> 00:59:29,235
You hacked my medical records!

926
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:31,365
Don't you hate it when
mum and dad argue?

927
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:33,436
Think about it. You're not dying -
it's good...

928
00:59:33,437 --> 00:59:35,636
Don't worry. I've got you.

929
00:59:38,236 --> 00:59:40,436
It's good news, Frank.
You're not dying. It is good...

930
00:59:40,437 --> 00:59:42,715
It's good news! Have you any idea
what I've been through?

931
00:59:42,716 --> 00:59:44,696
I was up on the roof. You were what?

932
00:59:44,697 --> 00:59:46,415
I was looking right down
into the traffic.

933
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,796
I could have jumped!

934
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:51,365
But, obviously, Khadija,

935
00:59:51,366 --> 00:59:55,285
there are other ways in which
the government has failed us.

936
00:59:55,286 --> 00:59:58,696
Which other ways? Well, that would
have been deeply regrettable.

937
00:59:58,697 --> 00:59:59,875
Regrettable?!

938
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:02,405
I would have been tomato bisque
on the side walk. Wait!

939
01:00:02,406 --> 01:00:04,405
Are you fucking nuts?
Wait! What is not known

940
01:00:04,406 --> 01:00:07,155
is the extent to which
deep fake technology has already

941
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:09,166
pervaded our society. In what sense?

942
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:13,805
The truth is, deepfakes
have been deployed by the British

943
01:00:13,806 --> 01:00:16,075
authorities for a number of years
now... What's this?

944
01:00:16,076 --> 01:00:20,155
...in ways that threaten our core
values of democracy, liberty...

945
01:00:20,156 --> 01:00:21,566
What is this? ..rule of law.

946
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:26,845
Mr Turner, you have to admit that
the idea of British authorities...

947
01:00:26,846 --> 01:00:29,566
This is not in the script.
This is not my script.

948
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,965
This operation is compromised.

949
01:00:30,966 --> 01:00:33,075
Compromised? What the fuck
you talking about?

950
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:36,645
It's the transcript you gave me.
No, it isn't. Khadija, wrap it up.

951
01:00:36,646 --> 01:00:40,375
Did you switch the script? No, of
course not! Khadija, wrap it up.

952
01:00:40,376 --> 01:00:43,446
Wrap it up. KHADIJA: Deepfakes are
deployed...

953
01:00:43,447 --> 01:00:45,446
Khadija, wrap it up!
She can't hear you.

954
01:00:45,447 --> 01:00:47,955
If I ever...
Unless she's in on it.

955
01:00:47,956 --> 01:00:49,215
Shut the whole thing down.

956
01:00:49,216 --> 01:00:52,125
I can't get in! The asset or
the transmission? Everything.

957
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:53,365
Everything.

958
01:00:53,366 --> 01:00:56,316
Ma'am, you can't cut the broadcast.

959
01:00:56,317 --> 01:00:58,885
Right now, he's just a politician
with a conspiracy theory.

960
01:00:58,886 --> 01:01:01,285
Shut it down,
everyone will believe it.

961
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:02,846
She's got a point.

962
01:01:12,567 --> 01:01:14,186
Does she?

963
01:01:16,066 --> 01:01:19,447
Mr Turner, deepfakes
have been deployed in what way?

964
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:25,596
They call it Correction.

965
01:01:27,427 --> 01:01:31,675
It's a method of real-time video
manipulation, using the disruption

966
01:01:31,676 --> 01:01:34,566
of camera feeds and the deployment
of deep fake technology.

967
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:38,566
Who do you mean by "they"? Members
of our own intelligence services,

968
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:41,416
our government and the police.

969
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,485
But, Mr Turner, to be clear,
you're asserting that there's some

970
01:01:45,486 --> 01:01:48,805
sort of program me within British
intelligence to create

971
01:01:48,806 --> 01:01:51,165
fake video footage.

972
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:54,235
Well, let's say they have intel
of a terrorist plot,

973
01:01:54,236 --> 01:01:56,965
but the evidence against the
suspects is insufficient...

974
01:01:56,966 --> 01:01:58,605
They make up incriminating footage?

975
01:01:58,606 --> 01:02:01,596
Well, THEY would say they turn
intelligence into evidence.

976
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:12,215
Rachel Carey...
This is a serious accusation.

977
01:02:12,216 --> 01:02:16,446
...you are under arrest for breach
of the Official Secrets Act.

978
01:02:16,447 --> 01:02:19,005
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

979
01:02:19,006 --> 01:02:21,285
if you do not mention
when questioned...

980
01:02:21,286 --> 01:02:23,805
I am sorry, ma'am, but you're
currently within the legal

981
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,845
jurisdiction of the
United States of America.

982
01:02:26,846 --> 01:02:29,925
Frank. Whilst you remain within the
legal jurisdiction... You don't have

983
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:32,235
the power to arrest... of the
United States of America,

984
01:02:32,236 --> 01:02:34,556
you must abide by the rules,
regulations

985
01:02:34,557 --> 01:02:36,915
and limitations of US...
Frank!

986
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:40,855
Would you shut the fuck up?
Now, if you'll excuse me,

987
01:02:40,856 --> 01:02:42,655
I know how this ends.

988
01:02:42,656 --> 01:02:44,955
Frank, please detain DCI Carey.

989
01:02:44,956 --> 01:02:47,385
I've reason to suspect
she's involved in subversive action

990
01:02:47,386 --> 01:02:50,645
against the state. Not my state.

991
01:02:50,646 --> 01:02:52,896
He hasn't said anything
about the US.

992
01:02:54,496 --> 01:02:56,935
Frank, help!

993
01:02:56,936 --> 01:02:59,525
For crying out loud!

994
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,447
She gives me cancer,
then she asks for my help.

995
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:07,285
The moment you set foot
outside this building,

996
01:03:07,286 --> 01:03:09,966
you are eligible for arrest!

997
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:15,856
As we all are...

998
01:03:17,366 --> 01:03:18,995
...ma'am.

999
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:20,985
Rachel!

1000
01:03:20,986 --> 01:03:22,965
Listen!

1001
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,656
You don't know what you've done.

1002
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:33,106
I know one thing...

1003
01:03:34,866 --> 01:03:37,976
...Patrick Flynn hated Correction.

1004
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:49,765
KHADIJA: And this so-called
Correction... Correction program me.

1005
01:03:49,766 --> 01:03:52,125
Correction program me -
when were you made aware of it?

1006
01:03:52,126 --> 01:03:55,005
When I became a victim. A victim?

1007
01:03:55,006 --> 01:03:57,725
People may have noticed
there have been a number of things

1008
01:03:57,726 --> 01:04:00,735
I've said out of character recently
- absurd ideas

1009
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:03,025
I would never advocate.
Racial profiling, for example.

1010
01:04:03,026 --> 01:04:05,745
Are you suggesting that it wasn't
you who made those comments?

1011
01:04:05,746 --> 01:04:09,696
No, I'm not suggesting it, Khadija,
I'm saying it loud and clear.

1012
01:04:12,846 --> 01:04:15,436
Mr Turner, you have to admit
that the idea of...

1013
01:04:15,437 --> 01:04:17,875
I always knew you were destined
for greatness...

1014
01:04:17,876 --> 01:04:21,075
...creating false evidence...
..one way or another.

1015
01:04:21,076 --> 01:04:23,915
...you were railing against
a moment ago.

1016
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:25,556
You should get down there.

1017
01:04:25,557 --> 01:04:27,586
You're missing the best bit.

1018
01:04:35,156 --> 01:04:37,436
You're not worried people will
think this is

1019
01:04:37,437 --> 01:04:40,375
some outlandish conspiracy theory?

1020
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:43,125
Well, people should question it.

1021
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:46,215
We need to challenge everything
we're told and question

1022
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,806
everything we see.

1023
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:54,405
We need to ask of every voice
on every recording of every image

1024
01:04:54,406 --> 01:04:55,606
on every screen...

1025
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:59,016
...how do we know this is real?

1026
01:05:01,136 --> 01:05:03,536
In his interview, for example.

1027
01:05:05,296 --> 01:05:08,665
It purports to be a live broadcast.
Well, it is a live broadcast.

1028
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:10,975
Can you prove it? Well, I can go
online,

1029
01:05:10,976 --> 01:05:13,045
show the latest news headlines.

1030
01:05:13,046 --> 01:05:16,336
All right, now we're getting
somewhere. But what about me?

1031
01:05:16,337 --> 01:05:17,816
What about you?

1032
01:05:19,327 --> 01:05:24,175
Well, I look like Isaac Turner,
I sound like Isaac Turner.

1033
01:05:24,176 --> 01:05:26,616
How do we know I'm the real deal?

1034
01:05:28,337 --> 01:05:32,415
Who's to say the real Isaac Turner
isn't in a car, right now,

1035
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:34,296
on the way to Piccadilly Circus?

1036
01:05:42,746 --> 01:05:48,505
Who's to say the cameras filming
this interview haven't been hacked?

1037
01:05:48,506 --> 01:05:52,285
Who's to say Isaac Turner's image
hasn't been captured,

1038
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:54,806
animated by artificial intelligence?

1039
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:04,105
Who's to say, since the very
start of this interview,

1040
01:06:04,106 --> 01:06:07,585
while you believed you were watching
Isaac Turner,

1041
01:06:07,586 --> 01:06:11,235
you were, in fact, watching me -

1042
01:06:11,236 --> 01:06:13,317
a deep fake. Fake...
AUDIO DISRUPTION

1043
01:06:16,086 --> 01:06:17,826
It's impossible to say.

1044
01:06:28,676 --> 01:06:31,635
Unless, of course, you happen
to be in Piccadilly Circus right now

1045
01:06:31,636 --> 01:06:35,226
and can see Isaac Turner
with your own eyes, then...

1046
01:06:39,366 --> 01:06:41,106
...perhaps you can.

1047
01:06:44,026 --> 01:06:47,005
If you are in or near Piccadilly
Circus,

1048
01:06:47,006 --> 01:06:48,646
look around you.

1049
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:54,116
Take out your phones
and start filming.

1050
01:06:56,276 --> 01:07:00,715
Hopefully, together, we can shine
a light on the challenges

1051
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,486
we face surrounding deepfakes.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1052
01:07:07,766 --> 01:07:11,025
And, hopefully, we can begin to
raise awareness of the illegal

1053
01:07:11,026 --> 01:07:13,285
practice of Correction.

1054
01:07:13,286 --> 01:07:17,415
Because only by bringing
this conspiracy out into the open

1055
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:19,386
can we hope to confront it.

1056
01:07:34,856 --> 01:07:40,045
As you can see, I'm not
in the studio with Isaac Turner MP.

1057
01:07:40,046 --> 01:07:43,425
Mr Turner is in
Piccadilly Circus,

1058
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:45,815
graciously playing his part
in our, hopefully,

1059
01:07:45,816 --> 01:07:48,216
eye-opening stunt.

1060
01:07:48,217 --> 01:07:53,026
You have indeed been watching
a deep fake interview.

1061
01:07:56,467 --> 01:08:01,015
But the alarming practice
of Correction described in it

1062
01:08:01,016 --> 01:08:04,415
is very much real.

1063
01:08:04,416 --> 01:08:07,055
Working with a team
of whistle-blowers from the heart

1064
01:08:07,056 --> 01:08:12,265
of British intelligence, the BBC
has obtained evidence that knowledge

1065
01:08:12,266 --> 01:08:16,995
of the so-called Corruption
program me extends across multiple UK

1066
01:08:16,996 --> 01:08:21,986
intelligence agencies and to senior
members of the British government.

1067
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:26,555
In a series of exclusive reports,

1068
01:08:26,556 --> 01:08:29,595
starting tonight, we will be
examining these alarming

1069
01:08:29,596 --> 01:08:31,356
revelations in detail

1070
01:08:32,556 --> 01:08:35,555
We will be sharing the evidence
obtained by the BBC.

1071
01:08:35,556 --> 01:08:40,197
And, finally, we will be confronting
those ultimately responsible.
