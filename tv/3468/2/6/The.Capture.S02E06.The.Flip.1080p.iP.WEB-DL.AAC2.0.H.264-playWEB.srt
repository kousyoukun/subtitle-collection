我没说出辞职的真实原因

有人来找过你了 是吧

没有人能在镜头外对我嚷嚷

你觉得人会变吗
You think a person can change?

43

我不知道我会不会变

44
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,460
你告诉我们你会变的
You told us you could change.

我的英国朋友们信了

只有上帝知道她在想什么

我告诉过他们
Me, I told them...

50
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,600
眼见为实
..I'll believe it when I see it.

51
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,570
但是你 快道小姐

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,940
你啊 你最好祈祷人是会变的

你能不能活着出去就靠这个了

吉尔 内政大臣就是不肯罢休

61
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,370
我们需要重新部署 作出回应
We need to regroup. Respond.

62
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,950
车在路上了
The car's on its way.

63
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,990
好
Erm...OK.

64
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,620
你听过录音了吧
I mean, you heard the recording, right?

65
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,540
他已经承认和爱丽莎合谋阻碍了维多利亚·贝洛的申请
I have got him admitting he colluded with Aliza to obstruct Victoria Bello's application.

66
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,960
向你致敬 艾萨克
And for that, I salute you, Isaac.

67
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,920
但是仅仅有这个还不算战术
But that alone is not a strategy.

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,300
是时候启动杀死吉尔行动了
It's time to launch Operation Kill Gill.

69

我会带点心来 你有对什么过敏吗

有什...
Any...?

71
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,680
没有
No. Erm...

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,730
格雷戈里 这样安全吗
..Gregory, is...is this safe?

73
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,480
我是说这样打电话
I mean, us talking on the phone like this.

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,750
只要是在和我打电话 艾萨克
So long as it's me you're talking to, Isaac,

75
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,480
你就是安全的
you're safe.

76
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,810
看镜头
Face the camera.

77
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,860
读出高亮的那一段
Read the highlighted paragraph.

78
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,110
官方声明

79
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,400
大点声
Aloud.

80
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,980
我 瑞秋·凯里 明白...
I...Rachel Carey... understand...

81
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,620
我去 我让你大声点
Oh, Colonel Kurtz. I said aloud.

82
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,220
我 瑞秋·凯里
I, Rachel Carey,

83
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:50,010
明白我正处于美利坚合众国的合法管辖范围内
understand that I am currently within the legal jurisdiction of the United States of America.

84
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,940
只要我还在
Whilst I remain within the legal jurisdiction

85
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,480
美国的管辖范围内
of the United States of America,

86
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,650
就受到美国联邦法律
I am bound by the rules, regulations

87
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,970
和法规的限制
and limitations of US federal law.

88
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,460
奇怪 你指望别人遵守你们的法律
Strange - expecting others to obey your laws

89
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,340
但是却一直触犯我们的法律
while you break every last one of ours.

90
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,590
安静点 小野猫
Settle down, wildcat.

91
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,720
你已经负伤了
You've already got one battle scar.

92
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,310
你为什么对这么重要的情报隐瞒不报呢
Why did you withhold this critical piece of intelligence?

93
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,690
摄像头拍到了俄罗斯派遣的刺客
Russian state assassin captured on camera.

94
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,150
-你却不说 -没有律师在场我是不会说的
- You didn't share it? - I'm not talking without a lawyer.

95
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,490
你没有被捕
You're not under arrest.

96
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,990
那就加兰德吧
Garland, then.

97
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,660
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

98
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,250
我要总警司吉玛·加兰德出席我的审讯
I want DSU Gemma Garland present at my interrogation.

99
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,050
我猜她正看着我呢
I'm guessing she's in on this, too.

100
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,420
对吧
Right?

101
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,970
抱歉 孩子
Sorry, kiddo.

102
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,680
妈妈不在家
Momma's not home.

103
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,530
你跟我仔细说说这图片是哪儿来的
Why don't you tell me exactly how you got a hold of this image.

104
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,690
我也想问你
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

105
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,860
我很想在问问题的间隙用湿布捂住你的脸
I'd like to put a soaking cloth over your face between questions.

106
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,950
但是我最近在练习克制
But...I'm exercising restraint.

107
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,160
格雷戈里·诺克斯分享给你的是吧
Gregory Knox shared this with you, didn't he?

108
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,250
我强烈推荐你自己也练练
I strongly suggest you exercise some yourself.

109
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,420
但是你已经知道口罩下的人是谁了
But you already knew who the man behind the mask was.

110
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,550
尼古拉·米尔斯基 如果这是他的真名的话
Nikolai Mirsky, if that's his name.

111
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,140
你记得我们谈过改变的事吧
Remember when we talked about change?

112
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,840
-他不是俄罗斯人 对吧 -从现在开始就再好不过了
- He's not a Russian national, is he? - Now would be a good time to start.

113
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,560
我会说他本来是为你工作的
I'm going to say he worked for you

114
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,390
直到他变成了累赘
until he became a liability,

115
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,560
你就让他的搭档打爆了他的头
and you had his partner blow his brains out.

116
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,690
我是想做对的事
I mean...I try to do the right thing.

117
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,140
我不知道你和格雷戈里·诺克斯在谋划什么
I don't know what you're plotting with Gregory Knox,

118
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,890
-但是我希望这是值得的 -为了什么呢
- but I do hope it's worth it. - And for what?

119
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,360
-好像中途死了很多人 -自视甚高的快道公主
- A lot of people seem to be dying in the process. - An entitled fast-track princess...

120
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,650
-爱迪生·姚 约瑟夫·姆旺吉 杰森·麦肯纳 -一堆废话在我的耳边
- Edison Yao. Joseph Mwangi. Jason McKenna. - ..yap-yap-yapping... in my ear

121
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,080
-李·布拉德伯里 -不知道什么时候该
- Lee Bradbury. - ..doesn't know when...

122
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
-帕特里克·弗林 -他妈的闭嘴
- Patrick Flynn. - ..to shut the fuck up!

123
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,540
那小子运气真的差
Your boy had shitty luck.

124
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,330
看到了不该看的东西
Saw something he shouldn't.

125
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,630
这种事时有发生
It happens.

126
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,530
但是你 从另一方面来讲
But you, on the other hand - nah,

127
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,880
你很幸运 不是吗
you got all the luck in the world, don't you?

128
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,720
带着窃听器 拍下了我的人
Wearing a wire, catching my boy on camera.

129
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,310
你应该在停户间里 躺在他旁边
You should be lying in the morgue right next to him.

130
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,470
你本来该去的
You would be, too,

131
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,530
但是你有守护天使
if it wasn't for your fucking guardian angels.

132
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,900
弗兰克
Frank.

133
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,710
杀死吉尔计划 第二阶段
Operation Kill Gill, phase two.

134
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,800
我们需要把艾萨克·特纳放在他最大的观众面前
We need to put Isaac Turner in front of his biggest audience yet.

135
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,680
在整个国家的见证下扳倒内政大臣
Take down the Home Secretary with the whole country watching.

136
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,680
这个蠢货每次公开否认
Every public denial this doofus makes,

137
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,640
故事就会变得更广为人知
the story grows bigger.

138
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,730
与此同时
Meanwhile,

139
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,600
艾萨克·特纳只想赶紧开始自己的新计划
Isaac Turner is simply trying to get on with his important new schedule -

140
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,360
-推广商业计划 开放战争纪念馆 -体育活动呢
- promoting business schemes, opening war memorials.  - Sports initiatives?

141
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,990
好
Yes.

142
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,520
但那些讨厌的记者一直缠着他
But those pesky reporters won't stop badgering him

143
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,950
问罗文·吉尔的事
about Rowan Gill.

144
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,120
为了公众利益 你同意接受独家采访
In the public interest, you agree to an exclusive interview.

145
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,580
听着 我不想表现得像是来复仇的
Look, I...I don't want, you know, to seem like I'm out for revenge.

146
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,040
我就知道你能懂
I knew you'd get it.

147
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,470
大概一个小时前
Approximately one hour ago,

148
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,970
我和内政大臣罗文·吉尔一起出席了一个简报会
I was present at a briefing with Home Secretary Rowan Gill,

149
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,710
我了解到他完全清楚「移花接木」
who I learned has full knowledge of Correction

150
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,520
及其在英国的使用情况
and its use within the UK.

151
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,980
哈特指挥官和总警司加兰德也在场
Also present was Commander Hart and DSU Garland.

152
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,700
最近好像有人想把你电脑上的信息都清除掉
It appears somebody recently tried to wipe it all from your computer.

153
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,820
就是藏在浴室里的那个笔记本电脑
The laptop hidden in your bathroom?

154
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,540
但是没有完全从回收站里删除
But hadn't quite managed to delete it from the deleted folder.

155
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,620
-典型的新手 -妈的 阿比盖尔
- Rookie mistake.  - Fucking Abigail.

156
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,540
我必须说 我觉得你的
I must say, I found it rather sweet...

157
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,130
小文章挺不错的
..your little journal.

158
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,550
不太像爱德华·斯诺登 更像是阿德里安·摩尔
Not quite Edward Snowden. More...Adrian Mole.

159
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,390
然后我提醒自己 天真和背叛
And then I reminded myself that naivety and treachery

160
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,350
并不是相互排斥的
are not mutually exclusive.

161
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,770
还有谁参与了
Who else is involved...

162
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,980
你的谋划
..in your plot?

163
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,620
-长官 -嗯
- Guv.  - Yeah.

164
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,170
我认为反恐司令部被刻意隐瞒了情报
I think the SO-15 contingent is seriously overdue a briefing.

165
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,550
昨晚我派了三个武装部队去搜查可疑车辆
I sent three armed units off to the suspect vehicle last night.

166
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,590
十分钟后 耳麦里报告说交火了 还说目标已倒下
Ten minutes later, we get "shots fired" over comms and "target down".

167
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,930
然后呢
And?

168
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,350
这三个小队 没有一个持械队员确认击毙
Between all three units, not one firearms officer claimed the kill.

169
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,830
你在质疑通讯被入侵了吗
You're questioning the comms traffic?

170
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,640
最近发生的事情 让我质疑一切
I'm questioning everything, after recent events.

171
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,100
-我没有没有拿下嫌疑人 -拿下了
- Did we take down a suspect?  - Yes.

172
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,650
-有尸体吗 -人被杀了一般都有尸体
- Is there a body?  - There usually is when someone's killed.

173
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,490
大家都说 当时一片混乱
There was a lot of confusion in the vicinity, by all accounts.

174
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,950
控制室里才一片混乱 长官
There was a lot of confusion in the control room, guv.

175
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,530
消失的车辆 耳熟吗
Disappearing vehicles - sound familiar?

176
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,620
这是先锋计划的重要一刻
A major event in Operation Vanguard

177
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,580
我们却什么都看不清楚
and not one of us had eyes on.

178
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,420
找个信得过的人
A bit of reassurance wouldn't go amiss

179
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,460
让我们安心一下也可以啊
from someone we can trust.

180
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,270
欢迎来到这场「移花接木」的噩梦 艾萨克
Welcome to the nightmare that is Correction, Isaac.

181
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,270
我们的敌人伪造了我们不能否认的事
Our enemies fake things which we can't deny.

182
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,270
这个视频文件上有很多信息
There's a lot of information on this video file,

183
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,190
我是说 并不只是罗文·吉尔
and I don't mean from Rowan Gill.

184
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,700
这种像素 说明使用的是媒体相机
The resolution suggests the type of camera used more by journalists

185
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,150
而不是警用相机
than police.

186
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,530
所以我再问你一遍
So I ask you again...

187
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,330
还有谁参与了
..who else is involved?

188
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,030
卡迪加·汗
Khadija Khan?

189
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,290
都结束了 瑞秋
It's over, Rachel.

190
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,010
从你第一次越界到最近一次的细节我们都有
We have everything from your first transgression to your most recent.

191
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,970
别忘了
Not forgetting...

192
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,930
这个小小的宝石
..this little gem.

193
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,890
帕特里克本来就不该是目标 对吧
 Patrick wasn't meant to be a target, though, was he?

194
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,050
我们为你做了那么多 你就这样回报我们
After everything we've done for you, this is how you repay us.

195
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,370
-而且这也不是你第一次没能阻止了 -够了
- And it wouldn't be the first time you failed to stop it!  - That is enough!

196
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,780
汉娜·罗伯茨是英国的敌人
Hannah Roberts was an enemy of the British state.

197
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,070
你以为呢
What did you expect?

198
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,160
你们监视了我的家
You monitor me in my home.

199
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,390
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

200
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,920
每个房间都有摄像头 日夜监视着我
Cameras in every room, watching me day and night.

201
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,250
当然 我既不能证实
Naturally, I can neither

202
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,420
-也不能否认任何此类行动 -在我的卧室里
- confirm or deny any such operation. - In my bedroom!

203
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,630
-如果你被监视了 -看着我躺在床上
- If you were under surveillance... - Watching me in bed!

204
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,010
-事实证明这是完全合理的 -我都不能睡觉
- ..it's turned out to be entirely justified.  - I can't sleep!

205
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,810
-你秘密录下了英国情报 -我需要保险
- You secretly recorded British intelligence.  - I needed insurance!

206
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,440
你太让人失望了 瑞秋
What a crushing disappointment you are, Rachel.

207
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,860
明明给了你这么多机会
After all the chances you've been given.

208
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,670
从我加入机构的那一刻起你就一直瞒着我
You kept me in the dark from the moment I joined the department,

209
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,710
把我下放到地图部
banishing me to Mapping...

210
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,030
-你们这一代人是怎么 -一直监视着我
- What is it about your generation... - ..keeping me under surveillance.

211
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,700
即时满足感一旦被拒绝就崩溃
..that causes you to melt at the denial of instant gratification?

212
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,330
你应该将功赎过才对 你应该去赢得我们的信任
You were serving a penance. You were supposed to be earning our trust.

213
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,330
我本来对你印象深刻
I was impressed with you.

214
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,090
你看穿了这都是弗兰克·纳皮尔干的
You saw this was all Frank Napier's doing.

215
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,470
在我看穿之前
Before me.

216
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,100
在我们所有人之前
Before any of us.

217
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,520
你都能让那人当你面把自己所犯下的罪责和盘托出
You even managed to get the man to blurt out his culpability right in front of you,

218
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,600
即使这意味着你差点被割喉
even if it did mean nearly getting your throat slit.

219
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,110
你相当不错 瑞秋
You're not bad, Rachel.

220
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,890
你完全有能力胜任这份工作
You've got the capacity for the work, all right.

221
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,980
而你却白白浪费
And you want to squander it all...

222
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,120
就为了当个吹哨人
..so you can be some whistle-blower?

223
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,740
然后呢
And then what?

224
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,000
东躲西藏 跑去俄罗斯苟延残喘
Go into hiding, take refuge in Russia for the rest of your life?

225
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,450
你本有大把机会
There were opportunities for you.

226
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,870
现在也会有
Still would be.

227
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,420
我曾经有一刻以为能相信你
I mean, if I felt for a second I could trust you.

228
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,350
什么意思
What does that mean?

229
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,600
丹尼·哈特已经递交了辞职信
Danny Hart's handed in his notice.

230
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,060
反恐司令部需要个新指挥官
SO-15 will need a new commander.

231
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,650
新任反恐司令部指挥官是
The new commander of SO-15...

232
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,700
我么
..me?

233
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,810
不是 想什么呢
No. What?

234
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,990
是我
Me.

235
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,790
但要是我坐上丹尼·哈特的位置
But if I were to step into Danny Hart's shoes,

236
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,540
就得找人接替我的职位
I'd need someone to step into mine.

237
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,000
经过这些之后 你还指望我相信
You expect me to believe, after all this,

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,630
你会让我加入你的团队
you'd want me on your team?

239
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,300
我早该明白你是理解不了的
I should have known you'd fail to understand.

240
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,110
请谅解
Well, forgive me,

241
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,010
我更喜欢不牵扯谋杀和贪腐的工作
but I like my work a little less tainted with murder and corruption.

242
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,810
也许你脑震荡了
Perhaps you're concussed.

243
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,390
你 弗兰克·纳皮尔 格雷戈里·诺克斯
You, Frank Napier, Gregory Knox -

244
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,350
看来你们早就沆瀣一气了吧
I'm guessing you're all in on this together.

245
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,110
格雷戈里·诺克斯
Gregory Knox

246
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,270
是人类社会的祸害
is a scourge on human society.

247
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,900
他是当今世界中权力 政治和科技
He's everything that's wrong with power, politics and technology

248
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,030
所衍生出的污点
in the world today.

249
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,160
那你为什么要保护他
Then why are you protecting him?

250
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,240
你之前跟我说「移花接木」会用于伸张正义
You told me that I would see Correction used as a force for good.

251
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,160
我看到的却是被用来帮助像纳皮尔和诺克斯这样的人
I've seen it used to help people like Napier and Knox.

252
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,370
当发现弗兰克与此事有关 我跟你一样震惊
I was as appalled as you to discover Frank was involved in this.

253
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,500
但行动目的和运作方式是有区别的
But there's a difference between the aims of an operation and the running of it.

254
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,170
不管是什么 都让你成了谋害
Whatever it is, it makes you complicit in the murders

255
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,350
五个无辜之人的同谋
of five innocent people...

256
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,590
我决不会批准杀害英国国民
I would never sanction the killing of a British national.

257
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,050
参与掩盖真相
..complicit in the cover-up...

258
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,720
两者是不同的
The two things are not the same!

259
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
去跟法官解释区别吧
Explain the difference to a judge.

260
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,180
你真想知道吗
You really want to know?

261
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,600
我对这场风暴的介入
My intervention into this shitstorm

262
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,810
阻止了对英国人的杀戮 尤其是
prevented British killings - specifically...

263
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,150
对你的
..yours.

264
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,540
别跳
Don't do it!

265
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,210
你还好吗
Everything all right?

266
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,380
你看起来可不像是要迎接新的黎明
You don't seem on the precipice of a new dawn.

267
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,760
拿过来了吗
You have it?

268
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,770
你还指望是个大箱子么
Were you expecting a big suitcase?

269
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,990
被锁定了 需要密码
It's locked. Needs a code.

270
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,910
你任务完成后就能拿到了
And you shall have it upon completion of your work.

271
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,030
脑浆洒一地 这还不叫完成任务么
Brains on your flooring is not complete enough for you?

272
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,070
一点都不好笑 弗兰克 我都做噩梦了
That isn't funny, Frank. I've had nightmares.

273
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,820
我以为你会把她处理掉
I thought you were coming to deal with her,

274
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,550
而不是在我的走廊里解决你的内部争端
not settle your internal affairs in my corridor.

275
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,870
他们在处理了
They're cleaning it up!

276
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,080
记者在大楼附近打探消息
I've got journos sniffing around the building,

277
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,580
想挖黑料
and not the kind I like.

278
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,000
伦敦又有谣言说会有武装袭击
Rumours of another armed attack in London.

279
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,080
这个故事得收尾了
The story needs wrapping up.

280
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,000
不得有误
No loose threads.

281
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,220
这个
Well...

282
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,770
再说一遍 我不指望你能理解
Again, I wouldn't expect you to understand.

283
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,020
要是你能信任我
Consider this the sort of thing you might learn from me

284
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,990
而不是一直想着背叛我
if you could bear to give me your trust,

285
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,650
你可以从我身上学学这点
instead of constantly trying to betray me.

286
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,260
当警察发现阴谋 他们会实施逮捕
When the police uncover a conspiracy, they make arrests.

287
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,370
而间谍
A spy...

288
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,040
会扭转乾坤
..flips it.

289
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,880
引导其发展成对他们有利的局势
Keeps it running to their advantage.

290
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,250
不到36小时前 我确认了弗兰克·纳皮尔
I confirmed Frank Napier's involvement in this

291
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,930
与此事有关
not 36 hours ago...

292
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,700
当时他是去跟我分享情报的
..when he came to me in a sharing mood.

293
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,700
他的枪手就在你公寓外面待命
His gunmen were outside your flat,

294
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,800
等待他下令
waiting for his order.

295
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,510
你的摄像头拍到了他的人
You caught one of them on camera,

296
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,180
当然会成为弗兰克·纳皮尔的下一个击杀目标
of course you were going to be next on Frank Napier's kill list.

297
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,510
而你阻止了他
Until you stopped him.

298
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,690
我说服了他
Until I persuaded him

299
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,940
让我接手负责
to let me take the reins.

300
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,240
你怎么
How did...?

301
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,700
就当是我调解了一场道德领导力危机吧
Let's just say I mediated a crisis of moral leadership.

302
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,790
所以
So...

303
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,590
虽然你否定了我在行动中的作用
..I'm sorry if you disapprove of my joining the operation.

304
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,090
但要是我没参与
But if I hadn't...

305
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,510
机会的大门不会一直敞开 瑞秋
The door to this opportunity will not stay open long, Rachel.

306
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,980
我建议在它关闭之前 你要好好利用
I suggest you take advantage before it shuts.

307
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,730
把你收集到的所有「移花接木」的证据都给我
Give me everything you have on Correction,

308
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,270
告诉我你在跟谁合作
tell me who you're working with...

309
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,480
我们再想办法如何继续
..and we'll find a way to move on.

310
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,150
要是我不答应呢
And if I don't?

311
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,910
我的天
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

312
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,300
我就知道你会这么问
I thought you might ask that.

313
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,840
菲利普斯
Phillips.

314
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,880
如果我是你 我会做好心理准备
I'd brace yourself for this, if I were you.

315
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,950
每日新闻

316
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,950
■

317
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,950
实时：
内政部陷入混乱
仍在寻找告密者

318
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,190
西蒙·特纳在门口
Simone Turner is at Security.

319
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,430
什么事 艾萨克不在
Why? Isaac's not here.

320
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,190
她找的是你
She's asking for you.

321
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,570
知道了
OK.

322
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,450
我很好奇 你如果见识到「移花接木」的真正能力
I wonder if you'd be quite so determined to fight Correction

323
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,740
还会不会这么坚定地抵制它
if you saw what it was capable of.

324
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,510
我 瑞秋·凯里
I, Rachel Carey,

325
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,470
目前处于俄罗斯联邦法律管辖范围内
am currently within the legal jurisdiction of the Russian Federation.

326
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,390
俄罗斯政府已为我提供了安全避难
I have been offered safe harbour by the Russian state

327
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,140
我已经接受了
and I have accepted.

328
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,230
把那句改成"安全避难和庇护"
Make that "safe harbour and protection".

329
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,370
俄罗斯政府为我提供了安全避难和庇护
I have been offered safe harbour and protection by the Russian state

330
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,490
我已经接受了
and I have accepted.

331
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,830
"感激地接受"
"Gratefully accepted"?

332
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,500
我觉得挺好
Sounds good to me.

333
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,040
我很感激地接受了
 And I have gratefully accepted.

334
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,050
当初发生在艾萨克·特纳身上的事 就是用的这个程序
This is the program used on Isaac Turner.

335
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,170
我忘了说参加行动的另一个好处
I forgot to mention the other perk of joining the operation.

336
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,520
魔法箱尽在我掌握
I have control of the kit.

337
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,310
对于自己的背叛 你会觉得内疚吗 凯里总督察
Do you feel guilty for your betrayal, DCI Carey?

338
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,510
会
I do.

339
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,890
我对自己的所作所为深感后悔
I deeply, deeply regret what I've done.

340
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,450
你赢不了的 瑞秋
You can't win, Rachel.

341
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,670
你肯定能看出来吧
Surely you can see that.

342
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,140
你看到内政部关于吹哨人的声明了吗 特纳先生
Have you read the Home Office whistle-blower's claims, Mr Turner?

343
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,720
拉尔夫 今天的焦点是这群年轻人
You know, Ralph, today's meant to be about these young people

344
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,230
在努力实现他们的目标
trying to achieve their goals.

345
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,280
好了 媒体朋友们
OK, fine people of the press,

346
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,330
请各位移步 前去接待室
if you'd care to decamp to the hospitality suite,

347
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,120
特纳先生将马上过去
Mr Turner will join presently

348
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,660
回答你们的所有相关问题
to answer any related questions you have.

349
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,780
请提问与本次活动相关的问题
Let's keep them related, please.

350
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,250
好了
All righty.

351
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,960
嗨 亲爱的
Hi, darling.

352
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,200
你没事吧
Are you OK?

353
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,250
你怎么
What are you...?

354
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,220
等下 你怎么知道我来这儿了
Wait. How...How did you even know I'd be here?

355
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,260
你早上发的推特都在说这事
You've been tweeting about it all morning.

356
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,420
什么事
What's up?

357
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,180
我去见了爱丽莎
I went to see Aliza.

358
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,060
爱丽莎 见她干嘛
Aliza? Why did you do that?

359
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,270
我以为能有所收获
I thought I might get somewhere.

360
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,650
收获什么
Somewhere with...?

361
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,930
没人愿意回答的问题
The question no-one seems inclined to answer.

362
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,400
没事吧
We good?

363
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,320
等一下
Erm, just a second.

364
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,590
如果维多利亚·贝洛在撒谎
If Victoria Bello was lying,

365
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,030
那她的申请为什么会被内政部阻挠
why was her application obstructed by the Home Office?

366
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,700
其实 我一直在调查这件事
Oh, right. You know, I've actually been looking into that.

367
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,960
我还去质询了内政大臣
I managed to collar the Home Secretary about it.

368
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,130
别编了 艾萨克 爱丽莎显然比我更了解你
You can stop, Isaac. Aliza obviously knows you better than I do.

369
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,700
整个议会都是
It seems the whole of Westminster does.

370
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,630
-西蒙 -为什么大家都觉得这是真事
- Simmy... - Why did they assume it was true?

371
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,010
可能是因为他们觉得
Erm...probably because they judge me

372
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,220
我和其他人一样 道德标准低的可怜
by the same pathetically low standards as the rest of them.

373
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,890
英国议会
The Palace of Westminster

374
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,350
基本上就是个中年危机援助中心
is basically a midlife crisis support centre.

375
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,770
-"我当时不在家” -继续
- "I was away from home."  - Go on.

376
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,610
"我当时不在家 那阵子也比较情绪化 她"
You know, "I was away from home. It was an emotional time. She's..."

377
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,360
她是个漂亮女生
She's a good-looking girl.

378
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,610
是吧 女人
Yes, I suppose. Woman.

379
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,360
你当时在跟我置气
You were in a mood with me.

380
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,320
我跟你
I was in a mood...?

381
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,660
那可是我母亲的葬礼
It was my mother's funeral.

382
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,910
没错 我很难过 我需要支持
Yes, I was upset. I-I needed support.

383
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,000
维多利亚·贝洛能满足你需求
And Victoria Bello gave you some.

384
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,960
不是
No.

385
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,840
以孩子们名义发誓
Swear on the children.

386
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,760
发... 什么
Swe...? What?

387
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,130
我得摆脱这种挥之不去的疑虑 艾萨克
I need to shake this lingering doubt, Isaac.

388
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,320
我要去开新闻发布会了
You know, I am in the middle of a press conference.

389
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,600
以孩子们的名义发誓 这一切都不是真的
Swear on the children none of it's true.

390
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,310
行吧
OK. OK.

391
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,880
我发誓
Erm...I swear. I swear...

392
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,020
以孩子们的名义 以我们 以及我所珍视的一切的名义
..on the children, on us, on everything I hold dear...

393
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,700
维多利亚·贝洛所说的都是假的
..Victoria Bello's claim was false.

394
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,450
她儿子不是我的
Her son's not mine.

395
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,160
很明显
Obviously.

396
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,200
你 没提交过样本吧
You...didn't submit a sample, did you?

397
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,790
做亲子鉴定
For the paternity test?

398
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,720
这问题不难答 艾萨克
It's a simple question, Isaac.

399
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,600
你提交过DNA样本吗
Did you submit a sample of your DNA?

400
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,520
没
No.

401
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,770
所以电视上的结果是伪造的 正如你说的那样
So, they faked the result on TV, like you said they would?

402
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,150
不是 结果是不匹配
No. The result was negative.

403
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,400
如果是伪造的 那应该是匹配
A fake result would have been positive.

404
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,290
也就是说 结果不如你意的时候才算伪造的
So...it's only fake if you disagree with it?

405
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,250
我不是那孩子的父亲 西蒙 大家都知道
I'm not the father of that kid, Simone. Everyone knows that.

406
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,370
-那是因为新闻上是这么播的 -对
- Everyone knows it because it's on the news.  - Yes.

407
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,870
你跟我说别相信新闻
You told me not to trust the news.

408
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,190
你们俩没事吧
How are we doing, guys?

409
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,710
你可以相信新闻 西蒙
Ok. You...You can trust the news, Simone.

410
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,170
你之前为什么说我不能信
Why would you say I couldn't?

411
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,000
我 我当时糊涂了
I...I was confused.

412
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,510
糊涂
Confused?

413
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,720
还要再等会儿吗
Need another minute?

414
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,830
那关于种族定性的言论呢
What about those racial profiling comments?

415
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,760
好吧
OK...

416
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,140
-怎么了 -你那会儿也是糊涂了吗
- What about them? - Were you confused then?

417
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,300
是
Erm...yes.

418
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,050
是发表言论的时候糊涂了
Confused when you made them,

419
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,760
还是你告诉我那些话不是你说的时候糊涂了
or confused when you told me you didn't make them?

420
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,350
天啊 艾萨克 你分得清吗
Jesus, Isaac! Do you even know?

421
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,770
完全是一团乱麻 西蒙
The confusion is pretty non-fucking-stop, Simone.

422
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,480
但现在 都回归正轨了
But now...now...things are good.

423
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,280
事态正朝看对我们有利的方向发展 所以你没必要一直问
Things are going our way. So you don't need to keep asking questions

424
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,750
把所有事都掰开揉碎了分析
and picking everything apart.

425
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,280
有必要 艾萨克 因为我要了解真相
Oh, but I do, Isaac, because I need to get to the truth.

426
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,780
我现在完全被蒙在鼓里
And right now, I'm nowhere fucking near it!

427
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,580
我怎么知道你跟她之间什么都没有
How do I know nothing happened between you and that woman?

428
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,040
因为我刚刚用孩子发誓了
Because you just heard me swear it on our kids' lives!

429
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,250
但你在顾左右而言他 对吗
But that's...that's not quite what you said, though, is it?

430
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,210
你觉得我听不出区别
You thought I wouldn't notice.

431
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,880
真不知道你在说什么
Oh, my. You have lost me.

432
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,680
你以为我傻吗
Do you think I'm stupid?

433
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,380
我太熟悉你们这些政客了
No.  I've been around politicians too long.

434
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,720
-行吧 我说什么了 -你说维多利亚·贝洛指控不实
- OK, what did I say, then?  - You said Victoria Bello's claim was untrue.

435
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,290
对
Yes.

436
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,350
-她儿子不是你的种 -他不是
- And that her son's not yours. Which he isn't.

437
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,040
但你没说你们之间什么都没发生
But you didn't say nothing happened.

438
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,230
如果没做亲子鉴定 艾萨克
How do you know her son's not yours, Isaac?

439
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,450
你又怎么知道她儿子不是你的
If there's no paternity test.

440
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,380
是因为你没睡她 还是因为你戴套了
Is it because you didn't fuck her or because you used protection?

441
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,840
艾萨克
Erm...Isaac.

442
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,210
-先他妈等着 -没事了
- Just fucking wait!  - No, it's OK.

443
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,150
我是来问真相的 我已经问到了
I came for the truth, I think I've seen it.

444
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,010
-听着 -你知道吗
- Listen...  - You know...

445
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:37,060
戴套也不意味看百分之百安全
You know condoms aren't 100%.

446
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,640
你知道的吧
Do you realise that?

447
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,920
艾萨克·特纳和我 都曾想着曝光「移花接木」
Isaac Turner and I discovered a shared interest in exposing Correction,

448
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,030
不过这位议员现在已经改了主意
an interest the MP no longer appears to share.

449
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,620
卡迪加·汗在演播室被黑之后
Khadija Khan became aware of Correction

450
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,380
意识到了「移花接木」的存在
after the hack on the studio.

451
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,050
你帮她意识到的
Because you enlightened her.

452
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,340
我认为她可以跟我一起当吹哨人 没错
I saw an ally in blowing the whistle, yes.

453
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,310
汗有拿到你这份录像吗
Does Khan have your dossier?

454
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,270
没有 长官
No, sir.

455
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,600
我担心她在证据不足之前操之过急
I was concerned she'd broadcast before I gained enough evidence.

456
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,550
所以决定不给她
I decided not to share it.

457
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,910
她知道「移花接木」的事
She knows about Correction.

458
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,870
-毕竟 -怎么
- I mean...  - What?

459
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,840
卡迪加·汗似乎只关心她自己
All Khadija Khan seems to care about is Khadija Khan,

460
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,380
她脑子里只有独家新闻
getting her claws into the next exclusive.

461
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,350
她明明知道采访维多利亚·贝洛
She knew that interview with Victoria Bello

462
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,730
会失去艾萨克的信任
would mean losing Isaac's trust.

463
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,550
但她控制不住自己
She couldn't help herself.

464
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,220
艾萨克·特纳不信任汗
Isaac Turner doesn't trust Khan?

465
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,290
还有一件事 长官
Erm...there's something else, ma'am.

466
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,600
我车里收音机下面藏了几张存储卡
You'll find copies of all the files in my dossier on SD cards hidden

467
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,970
里面是我所有的录像副本
beneath the radio in my car.

468
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,180
-吉玛 -安东尼
- Jen.  - Anthony.

469
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,570
我想请你帮个忙
I'm calling for a favour.

470
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,070
行啊 你了解我的
Right. Well, you know me.

471
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,360
听说你要退休了
You're retiring, I hear.

472
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,790
是想多陪陪家人
Spend more time with the family,

473
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,700
还是受够了负罪感的煎熬
or can't take any more guilt?

474
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:15,550
我们需要你提供一份口供
We need you to provide a statement.

475
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,590
关于录像吗
About the dossier.

476
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,640
关于先锋行动
About Vanguard.

477
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,310
作为昨晚事件的唯一目击者
As sole witness to last night's events,

478
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,270
你的证词至关重要
your testimony is critical.

479
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,520
你当时去特鲁罗的办公楼里例行调查
You were following up on a routine inquiry in the offices of Truro Analytics

480
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,990
这时候发现袭击者闯入大楼
when you became aware of intruders in the building.

481
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:48,870
当时的首要任务就是确保他们的假定目标
Your priority then became the safety of their assumed target -

482
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,420
格雷戈里·诺克斯的安全
Mr Gregory Knox.

483
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,550
在确保诺克斯安全后
Shortly after securing Mr Knox in his office,

484
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,470
武装支援及时赶到 消除了威胁
armed support arrived to neutralise the threat.

485
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,130
但因为他们执行的是一项秘密行动
Due to their ongoing deployment on covert operations,

486
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,430
武装人员的身份将从你的报告中删去
the identities of the armed officers will be redacted from your report.

487
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:10,810
但你可以指认被击毙人员的身份
However, you can confirm the identity of the man fatally wounded at the scene...

488
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,900
是尼古拉·米尔斯基
..as that of Nikolai Mirsky...

489
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,810
俄罗斯人
..a Russian national

490
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:22,440
也是涉嫌谋杀爱迪生·姚 约瑟夫·姆旺吉
and the prime suspect in the murders of Edison Yao and Joseph Mwangi,

491
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,290
杰森·麦肯纳 李·布拉德伯里
Jason McKenna, Lee Bradbury...

492
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,250
和帕特里克·弗林的头号嫌疑人
..and Patrick Flynn.

493
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,600
你居然没直接伪造我签名
Surprised you didn't just fake the signature.

494
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,760
你不担心莫斯科那边的反应吗
You're not concerned about the fallout from Moscow?

495
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,840
莫斯科方面会否认
Moscow will deny it,

496
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,770
但不会反驳
but they won't disprove it.

497
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,220
我宁愿如此
I prefer it that way...

498
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,160
真真假假 让大家不知道该信什么
..no-one knowing what to believe.

499
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,040
长官 我明白 你是要我配合做一场假戏
Sir, I understand that you are asking me to comply with a false-flag op

500
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,610
以保护弗兰克·纳皮尔和格雷戈里·诺克斯
to protect Frank Napier and Gregory Knox. I just...

501
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,860
我只想知道为什么
I'd just like to know why.

502
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,070
你听到那个混蛋的话了吗
You hear that prick?

503
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,030
把硬盘给我时 还让我等后续的密码
Hands me the drive, tells me I've got to wait for the code.

504
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,410
真有他的
Yes, I can believe it.

505
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,740
把里面东西弄出来
Get me into this.

506
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,790
诺克斯才是那个混蛋
Knox is the prick.

507
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,860
怎么哪儿都有你
You're kind of hard to get rid of, aren't you?

508
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,490
就像一坨硬屎 怎么也冲不掉
Like a stubborn turd - just won't flush.

509
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,900
不如你给瑞秋讲讲硬盘里的内容吧
Why don't you brief Rachel on the contents of that drive?

510
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
你在命令我吗
Is that an order?

511
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,110
是
Yeah.

512
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,530
格雷戈里·诺克斯或许是个真小人 但...
Greg Knox may be a piece of shit, but...

513
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,830
他手里有所有的科技大厂的数据
he crunches data for every big tech company that matters.

514
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,910
我们努力了很久
Know how long we've been trying

515
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,040
才跟这样的人达成交易
to make a deal with somebody like that?

516
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,160
什么样的交易
What kind of deal?

517
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,420
我帮他成为操纵政客的提线大师
I helped him play puppet master to his politician.

518
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,750
作为回报 他给我提供秘密武器
For that, he gave me the secret weapon -

519
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,210
特鲁罗的算法
Truro's algorithm.

520
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,800
全球近30亿社交媒体账户权限
Access to almost 3 billion social media accounts worldwide.

521
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,180
所以你们能追踪到任何人活动
So you can track the activity of just about anyone?

522
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,130
不是追踪 是预测
Not track - predict.

523
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:20,060
这个算法能预测出一个人的行为趋势
The algorithm calculates behaviour right down to how suggestible a guy

524
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:24,070
不管他是想换牙膏 还是想投票给谁
is to changing his toothpaste or who he's going to vote for.

525
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,610
也可以预测出他有多反叛
You can also predict how prone he is to dissent.

526
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:32,530
从曼谷到墨西哥城 再到俄勒冈州的波特兰
Anyone from Bangkok to Mexico City to Portland, Oregon

527
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,000
任何人动一下颠覆的心思 我们都知道
even thinks about subversion, we'll know about it.

528
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,380
但要是进不去硬盘 这一切都白搭
Not if we can't access the drive, we won't.

529
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,920
那我看的是什么
What am I looking at?

530
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,090
我们只能访问 但无法迁移和修改
Well, you're looking at it - I just can't transfer it.

531
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,050
你能黑进BBC 却黑不进去这个
You mean you can get into the BBC but you can't hack into this?

532
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,260
他们用了AES256加密算法
This has AES 256-bit cipher.

533
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,310
我要是黑进去 数据会丢失
I can hack it, if you want to lose data.

534
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,680
诺克斯为什么不给你密码
Why won't Knox give you the code?

535
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,190
他不满意我们的工作
He's not happy with the work...

536
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,560
死的那些人
..carnage...

537
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,400
尸体的线索
..the trail of bodies.

538
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,070
他担心会怀疑到自己身上 对吗
He's concerned it might all lead back to him, right?

539
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,490
对
Right.

540
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,030
他会给我密码的
He'll give me the code -

541
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,890
等大家的注意力转移到别处去的时候
when everybody is looking the other way.

542

转移到东边
East.

543
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,810
你做得很好 瑞秋
Good work, Rachel.

544
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,190
这对全球安全有着里程碑式的重要意义
A landmark move for global security.

545
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,220
民主就靠边站了
If not democracy.

546
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,390
你这么快就忘了吗
Have you forgotten already?

547
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,600
我是怎么教你让形势为我们所用的
What did I teach you about flipping an operation to our advantage?

548
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,190
你守好这里 托德
The room's yours, Todd.

Rachel and I are stepping out for a while.

550
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,400
我们要去哪里 长官
Where are we going, ma'am?

551
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,830
弗兰克刚才说
You heard Frank.

552
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:36,030
格雷戈里·诺克斯想嫁祸于一个听命于科技大厂的政客
Gregory Knox is trying to plant a politician who answers to big tech.

553
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,630
我们得去阻止他
We are going to stop him.

554
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,680
能给我一杯淡伯爵茶吗 多加奶
Can I get a very weak Earl Grey with lots of milk?

555
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,850
你的全方位人工智能还好吗 格雷戈里
How's the all-seeing AI, Gregory?

556
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,550
那个强有力的项目
The great and powerful programme.

557
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,010
出什么问题了吗
Is there a problem?

558
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,600
嗯 是有点小问题
Erm...a slight problem, yes.

559
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,850
我遇到了个小麻烦
It seems I've hit a slight bump in the road

560
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,140
看来你的算法没能预测到
that your algorithm failed to predict.

561
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,770
-西蒙说她要离开我 -这么快
- Simone says she's going to fucking leave me.  - Already?

562
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,310
 什么
Al...? What?

563
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,810
哦 好吧
Ah, right.

564
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,360
你似乎一点都不紧张
You...You don't seem too alarmed.

565
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,320
如果我真的离婚了 你的算法对我竞选成功的几率
I can't imagine your algorithm's going to love my chances of success

566
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,700
应该不会很乐观吧
if I end up getting divorced.

567
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,200
这个可说不准
You can never second guess that thing.

568
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,400
怎么 如果我真的被甩了 反而不会有问题吗
So what? We might not have a problem if someone does, in fact, leave me?

569
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,960
不一定
Not necessarily.

570
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,210
你已经知道了
You knew?  Hmm?

571
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,760
你早知道
You knew. You knew.

572
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,050
你早就知道维多利亚· 贝洛的事
You knew dragging Victoria Bello out the woodwork

573
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,110
会摧毁我的婚姻
would destroy my marriage.

574
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,140
不 我知道有这个可能
No, I knew it...it might.

575
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,220
什么鬼
It...? What the fuck?

576
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,980
艾萨克 我们初次见面时你就说自己想出人头地
Isaac, you told us when we first met you wanted to get to the top.

577
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,600
但不代表我想妻离子散
Not if it meant losing my family.

578
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,690
-你没明确说明 -你疯了吧
- You didn't stipulate that. - Are you insane?

579
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,910
真抱歉 艾萨克
I'm sorry, Isaac,

580
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,780
但程序不喜欢你和西蒙在一起
but the program just doesn't see you with Simone.

581
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,740
很大一部分选民认为
A significant percentage of the electorate perceives

582
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,290
你的婚姻太讨巧了 他们不喜欢
your marriage as somewhat strategic and they don't like it.

583
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,540
你觉得这是我第一次听到这种话吗
Do you really think it's the first time I've heard that -

584
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,960
我娶西蒙是为了往上爬
that I married Simone to climb the ladder?

585
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,840
这种话我都听了13年了
I've had it thrown at me for 13 years.

586
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,170
你要是真觉得我会向这种话低头
So if you really think I'm going to give in to it now,

587
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,630
就让你和你的算法都去死吧
you and your algorithm can both go fuck yourselves.

588
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,380
-一派胡言 -这是大家的想法
- It's bullshit.  - It's what people think.

589
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,260
你为什么不去改变大家的想法
Then why don't you change what they think?

590
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,720
-这不是你的职责吗 -我的职责是让你当选
- I thought that was your job. - My job is to get you into power.

591
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,600
你的职责是走上巅峰 改变世界
Your job is to change the world when you get there.

There are some details, Isaac, even I'm not privy to.

-淡伯爵茶 多加奶 -完美
- Weak Earl Grey with lots of milk.  - Ah, perfect.

00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,760
或许不该带我去
I'm the wrong person to take with you.

614
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,990
-我们之前闹翻了 -我知道
- We didn't end on good terms. - I know.

615
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:29,220
先锋行动失败的时候
I deployed someone to keep track of your movements

616
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,640
我派人监视过你的一举一动
while Vanguard was down.

617
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,180
我猜这对你来说一定很尴尬吧
I imagine this is going to be pretty awkward for you, huh?

618
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,440
我最近遇到了麻烦
I find myself with a problem.

619
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,680
有些高度涉密的情报泄露到了你这里
Some highly classified intelligence has recently been disclosed to you.

620
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,990
既然总督察凯里都来了 你应该明白
I trust DCI Carey's presence leaves you in no doubt

621
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,660
我指的是什么情报
as to what intelligence I am referring.

622
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,040
凯里总督察会同意
As DCI Carey will confirm,

623
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,490
发生严重泄密事件的同时
this serious breach

624
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,710
也恰逢她警探生涯的低谷
coincided with a period of personal difficulty for the detective,

625
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:02,220
她现在意识到 自己当时的心理和精神状态不佳
which she now recognises impacted negatively on her mental health and wellbeing,

626
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,870
某些行为也非常得不专业
in particular her behaviour in the workplace.

627

如果我说错了 你可以随时纠正
Forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn.

00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:13,020
没有 你说的很对
No. I can confirm all of that.

629
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,150
怪不得你那天在楼下冲我大喊大叫
It explains the public outburst.

630
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,940
上一个这么吼我的人 已经去《第一秀》剪片子了
Last person who yelled at me like that's now editing the One Show.

631
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,700
我理解 想赢得你的合作
So, I realise I need something solid on the table

632
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,820
我得提供些实实在在的东西
if I'm to earn your cooperation.

633

我们部门很久以来都与你们台的一个信得过的人
The service has long enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship

他是内鬼
He's a fucking spook?

638
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,840
你在某些方面比他更懂行
In some ways, you're better informed than him already,

639
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,470
我敢说短期之内 我们就能达成一个行动目标
and I'll wager we can agree on one operational goal in the immediate term.

640
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,600
你是想收买我吗
Sorry, are you tapping me up?

811
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,990
-就为了内政部 -你是谁
- Just the Home Office? - Who is this?

812
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,660
格雷戈里
Gregory, it's...

813
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,060
是我啊
..it's me.

814
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,670
你说过不再作假的
You said no more deep fakes.

815
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,670
英国需要一个负责任的内政部
Britain deserves a Home Office that's fit for purpose.

816
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,810
我试过阻止他们了
I tried to stop them.

817
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:07,520
-真的 -是真的他吗
- I really tried.  - Is it fucking him?

818
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,670
你在说什么
Is what fucking him?

819
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:12,040
英国需要一位德能配位的内政大臣
Britain deserves a Home Secretary who's up to the job.

820
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,430
-我不知道怎么回事 -好
- Ah... I don't know what this is.  - Right.

821
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:18,990
胜任这份工作 不是说让特警部队东走西逛
By up to the job, I don't mean scurrying around SW1A getting caught up

822
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,570
被指控行为不端
in allegations of misconduct.

823
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,910
他做得挺好
He's doing OK.

824
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,940
■

825
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,940
威斯敏斯特
英国议会大厦所在地

826
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,940
-而是走出威斯敏斯特的泡沫 -格雷戈里
- I mean rising above the Westminster... bubble   - Gregory?

827
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,790
直面英国民主面临的每一个威胁
to confront every threat to British democracy head-on.

828
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:30,250
但是格雷戈里 那不是他
But, Greg...Gregory. It's not him.

829
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,210
师傅 麻烦掉个头
Erm, excuse me. Can you turn around?

830
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,510
我要回酒店
I need to go back to the hotel.

831
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,390
你好 打扰一下
Hello. Excuse me.

832
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:43,140
师傅 听得见吗
Driver! Hello!

833
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,640
你是在暗示英国民主面临的威胁
Are you suggesting there are threats to British democracy

834
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,560
-没有得到正视吗 -不是暗示 卡迪加
- not being confronted?  - I'm not suggesting it, Khadija,

835
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,770
我说得非常清楚
I'm saying it loud and clear.

836
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,530
能说明一下这些威胁的本质吗
Can you indicate the nature of some of those threats?

837
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:57,990
一个词
Two words...

838
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,530
科技大厂
..big tech.

839
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,950
-什么 -科技大厂
- What?!  - Big tech?

840
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:08,460
不管格雷戈里·诺克斯给你多少钱 都不值得
Whatever Gregory Knox is paying you, it's not going to be worth the hell

841
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,880
如果不掉头 我就要发火了
I'm going to unleash if you don't turn this fucking car around!

842
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,300
众所周知科技和社交媒体在极大程度上
We all know the extent to which technology and social media

843
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,380
渗透进了我们的日常生活中
has infiltrated our daily lives.

844
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,550
我们的家里 电脑屏幕上
It's in our homes, it's on our screens.

845
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,510
让我们的孩子沉迷成瘾
It's got our children hooked.

846
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:24,430
我敢说 这个国家我不是唯一一个
I dare say I'm not the only dad in the country who regrets giving in

847
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:26,930
向女儿智能手机让步的父亲
to their daughter's demands for a smartphone.

848
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:28,100
细节不错
Nice detail.

849
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,980
而且还渗透进了我们的政治体系
But it's also infiltrated our political systems -

850
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,590
■

851
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,590
特纳痛斥
科技巨头

852
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,690
-不光是英国 全球皆如此 -如何渗透
- not just in Britain, but around the world.  - Infiltrated how?

853
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:37,900
未经我们同意就获取我们的数据
By harvesting our data without our consent

854
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:42,570
并利用它干涉选举 公投 政治竞选
and using it to interfere with elections, referendums, political campaigns.

855
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,780
你是说科技公司
You're saying that tech corporations

856
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,200
直接干涉了英国政治
are meddling in UK politics directly?

857
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,700
不是直接
Well, not directly.

858
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:52,960
见不得人的的工作往往由硅谷以外的
The dirty work tends to be done by data analytics companies

859
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,670
-数据分析公司完成 -该死的
- outside of Silicon Valley.  - Shit!

860
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:56,500
比如说在英国吗
Here in the UK, for instance?

861
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,180
没错 我就知道英国有这么一个公司
I can think of one such example here in the UK, yes.

862
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,600
弗兰克 是你吗
Frank, is this you?

863
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,850
你他妈要对我做什么
What the fuck are you doing to me?!

864
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,050
情节有多严重 是非法的吗
How much of this is illegal?

865
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,700
只需想想 这些家伙在逃税避税方面
Well, we've seen how nimble these guys can be

866
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,060
是多么无所不用其极
when it comes to dancing around tax laws.

867
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:19,360
显而易见 卡迪加 如果英国的民主
Clearly, Khadija, if a plot to affect British democracy

868
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,320
被外国人的阴谋左右
was directed by a member of a foreign state,

869
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,120
这就是严重的国际事件
that's a serious international incident.

870
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,660
如果这些阴谋还得到了英国人的帮助
If a British national is found to have colluded in such

871
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,620
那这些人就是叛国
an attempt, that's treason.

872
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,750
我的天
Holy shit!

873
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,920
他已经开始逃了
Is he fleeing already?

874
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,840
我猜他要逃到厄瓜多尔
My money's on Ecuador.

875
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,600
-你觉得我们能拿他们问责吗 -目前不行
- Do you see any hope of holding them to account?  - Not as things stand.

876
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,720
这些科技巨头一副难以撼动的姿态
Tech giants behave as if they're untouchable.

877
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,340
英国需要一位内政大臣 确切来说 是一位首相
Britain needs a Home Secretary - indeed, a Prime Minister -

878
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,230
告诉他们 我们不怕
who isn't afraid to tell them otherwise.

879
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:58,770
什么叫全没有了 怎么可能
What do you mean, none? How's that possible?

880
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,780
在收到活检结果之前
We knew it was going to be inconclusive until we received

881
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,200
一切还有变数
the results of the biopsy.

882
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,320
所以从干疮百孔变成完全没有
So, from riddled to all clear?

883
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,950
我知道这挺罕见
I agree it's unusual.

884
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:15,210
CT成像会有误检的概率
Erm, CT imaging throws up anomalies from time to time,

885
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:17,990
但很少会差这么多
but rarely this inconsistent.

886
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,670
-你需要回来做个活检 -等一下
- You'll have to come in for a biopsy.  - Wait a second.

887
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,090
你给我看的那些图像
These images you've been showing me -

888
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,220
器官上布满阴影的那些图像
black tar covering all my internal organs -

889
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,100
都是电子版的吧
did you receive those electronically?

890
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,930
-全都是电子版的 -用邮件发送吗
- It's all electronic.  - By email?

891
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:35,300
都在医院的服务器上 我就是从那儿下载的
Uploaded to the hospital servers. I get it from there.

892
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,150
他妈的
Motherfucker.

893
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:44,780
令人担忧的是 科技行业对于干预选举的问题
Alarmingly, the tech industry has done absolutely nothing

894
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,320
一直作壁上观
to combat the issue of election interference.

895
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,240
我不禁要问问为什么
And, frankly, one has to ask why.

896
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,500
事实上 我们需要想一想 企业能从中捞到什么好处
In fact, one has to wonder what such corporations have to gain.

897
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,410
我没理解错的话 凯里总督察 你似乎挺享受这感觉
If I'm not mistaken, DCI Carey, you appear to be enjoying this.

898
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,880
格雷戈里·诺克斯的计划失败
Gregory Knox's plan has been sabotaged.

899
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,050
一场针对英国民主的袭击得以避免
An attack on British democracy has been averted.

900
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,870
尤其要感谢你的工作
Thanks to your work in particular,

901
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:11,470
为弗林警长的家人伸张了正义
DS Flynn's family feel a strong sense of justice for Patrick.

902
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,850
你现在也看到了 这个「移花接木」的程序
Are you starting to see the potential for good in this strange

903
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:20,360
它有用的一面了吧
little programme we call Correction?

904
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:31,600
弗兰克
Frank!

905
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,100
你还好吗
Are you OK?

906
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,410
好极了
Never better.

907
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,460
壮得像头驴
Fit as a mule, apparently.

908
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:44,360
医生说我可能得的是良性胃溃疡 不过
I mean, doctor says I may be looking at a benign stomach ulcer, but...

909
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,970
你是说
You mean...?

910
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,970
活检报告出来了
Biopsy report came back.

911
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:54,770
我没得癌症
I don't have cancer.

912
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,690
真是难以置信
But that's...incredible.

913
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:00,810
可不是吗
It is incredible,

914
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:03,480
就在前几天 我的CT扫描
when you consider that, just the other day, my CT scan

915
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,150
-还说我浑身是瘤呢 -说不通啊
- indicated I was riddled with it. - It doesn't make sense.

916
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,240
就在我告诉你我的病情后
That's right after I told you how sick I was.

917
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,660
-你得再去做些检查 -你他妈的干了什么
- You need to go in for some more tests.  - What the fuck did you do?

918
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,280
-我干了什么 -别他妈骗我
- What did  I  do? - Don't fucking lie to me.

919
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,240
弗兰克 你这是在说啥呢
Frank, I have no idea what you're talking...

920
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,830
-我知道你是幕后主使 -你貌似很生气
- I know you're behind this. - You're obviously very upset.

921
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,960
跟我说什么救赎 什么主日学校
All that talk about redemption, about Sunday School.

922
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,670
你想夺走我的行动 对吧
You wanted my fucking op, didn't you?

923
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:24,210
你搞了一出烂摊子
Well, something had to be done after the shit shower

924
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:27,050
-我总得做点什么吧 -你他妈疯了吗
- you made of it! - Are you out of your fucking mind?

925
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:29,360
还黑了我的医疗记录
You hacked my medical records!

926
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,390
爸妈吵架确实挺心烦的吧
Don't you hate it when mum and dad argue?

927
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,510
你现在不会死了 这不好吗
Think about it. You're not dying - it's good...

928
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:34,360
脚本编辑中

929
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,680
别担心 我帮你
Don't worry. I've got you.

930
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:41,480
这是好消息 弗兰克 你不会死了 多好啊
It's good news, Frank. You're not dying. It is good...

931
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,770
-好消息 -你知道我有多难过吗
- It's good news!  - Have you any idea what I've been through?

932
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:45,570
-我站在屋顶上 -你干啥了
- I was up on the roof.  - You were what?

933
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,440
我看着下面的车流
I was looking right down into the traffic.

934
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,960
我差点想跳下去
I could have jumped!

935
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,360
不过 卡迪加
But, obviously, Khadija,

936
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:56,290
政府还在其他方面辜负了我们
there are other ways in which the government has failed us.

937
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:59,750
-其他方面 -真跳下去就太遗憾了
- Which other ways?  - Well, that would have been deeply regrettable.

938
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,910
遗憾
Regrettable?!

939
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,420
-我会摔在人行道上 摔成番茄蛋汤 -等等
- I would have been tomato bisque on the sidewalk.  - Wait!

940
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,090
-你他妈疯了吗 -等等
- Are you fucking nuts?  - Wait!

941
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:08,210
目前已知 深伪技术已经在
is the extent to which deepfake technology has already

942
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,520
-我们社会蔓延开来 -你什么意思
- pervaded our society.  - In what sense?

943
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:14,800
英国当局使用深伪技术
The truth is, deepfakes have been deployed by the British

944
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,100
-已经很多年了 -这是什么
- authorities for a number of years now...  - What's this?

945
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,230
用来威胁我们民主 自由的核心价值观
..in ways that threaten our core values of democracy, liberty...

946
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:22,600
-这是什么 -包括立法
- What is this?  - ..rule of law.

947
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,860
特纳先生 你得承认英国当局
Mr Turner, you have to admit that the idea of British authorities...

948
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,610
这不在脚本里 不是我写的脚本
This is not in the script.  This is not my script.

949
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:31,990
有人破坏行动
This operation is compromised.

950
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,110
破坏 你他妈在说什么
Compromised? What the fuck you talking about?

951
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,170
-这是你给我的脚本 -不 这不是
- It's the transcript you gave me.  - No, it isn't.

952
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,660
卡迪加 别再说了
Khadija, wrap it up.

953
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,970
你换了脚本吗
Did you switch the script?

954
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:41,370
-当然没有 -卡迪加 停下
- No, of course not!  - Khadija, wrap it up.

955
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:44,460
-快停下 -深伪技术被用于
- Wrap it up.  - Deepfakes are deployed...

956
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:46,660
-停下 卡迪加 -她听不到你说话
- Khadija, wrap it up! - She can't hear you.

957
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,000
除非她也参与其中了
Unless she's in on it.

958
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,210
全都掐掉
Shut the whole thing down.

959
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,830
-我进不去 -数字形象还是信号
- I can't get in!  - The asset or the transmission?

960
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:53,180
全部
Everything.

961
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,410
全部掐掉
Everything.

962
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:57,050
长官 你不能切断直播
Ma'am, you can't cut the broadcast.

963
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,890
现在他只是个散播阴谋论的政客
Right now, he's just a politician with a conspiracy theory.

964
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:02,050
但如果掐断了 所有人都会相信的
Shut it down, everyone will believe it.

965
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,890
她说得有道理
She's got a point.

966
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:15,280
哦 是吗
Does she?

967
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,690
特纳先生 深伪技术都用在哪些方面
Mr Turner, deepfakes have been deployed in what way?

968
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,670
他们称之为「移花接木」
They call it Correction.

969
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:31,650
这是一种通过干扰摄像头信号
It's a method of real-time video manipulation,

970
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:35,590
利用深伪技术实时操控视频的方法
using the disruption of camera feeds and the deployment of deepfake technology.

971
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,330
你说的"他们"指的是谁
Who do you mean by "they"?

972
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,900
我们自己的情报机构
Members of our own intelligence services,

973
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,770
我们的政府和警察
our government and the police.

974
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,520
但特纳先生 我想问清楚 你在断言
But, Mr Turner, to be clear, you're asserting that there's some

975
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:52,190
我们英国情报部门有一个制造假视频的项目
sort of programme within British intelligence to create fake video footage.

976
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,280
举个例子 他们获得了恐怖阴谋的情报
Well, let's say they have intel of a terrorist plot,

977
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,030
但针对嫌疑人的证据不足
but the evidence against the suspects is insufficient...

978
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,620
他们会伪造犯罪视频
They make up incriminating footage?

979
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,860
用他们的说法 是把情报转化为证据
Well, THEY would say they turn intelligence into evidence.

980
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,210
-瑞秋·凯里 -这个指控非同小可
- Rachel Carey... - This is a serious accusation.

981
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:17,170
你因违反《官员保密法》而被捕
..you are under arrest for breach of the Official Secrets Act.

982
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:20,510
你可以保持沉默 但如果在某些问题上知情不答
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence

983
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,310
会在审判中对你不利
if you do not mention when questioned...

984
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,530
抱歉 长官
I am sorry, ma'am,

985
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:27,850
但你现在处于美利坚合众国的法律管辖之下
but you're currently within the legal jurisdiction of the United States of America.

986
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:29,230
弗兰克
Frank.

987
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:30,940
只要你还在他国法律管辖范围内
Whilst you remain within the legal jurisdiction...  You don't have

988
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:33,280
就不能在美国管辖范围内抓人
the power to arrest.  ..of the United States of America,

989
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,570
你必须遵守美国的法律
you must abide by the rules, regulations

990
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,950
-和法规 -弗兰克
- and limitations of US... - Frank!

991
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:41,910
-你能闭嘴吗 -如果不介意的话
- Would you shut the fuck up? - Now, if you'll excuse me,

992
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,700
我先出去了
I know how this ends.

993
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,000
弗兰克 拜托拘留凯里总督察
Frank, please detain DCI Carey.

994
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
我有理由怀疑她参与了颠覆活动
I've reason to suspect she's involved in subversive action against the state.

995
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,670
又没颠覆我的国家
Not my state.

996
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:54,160
她没提到一丁点美国
He hasn't said anything about the US.

997
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:57,970
弗兰克 帮帮忙
Frank, help!

998
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:00,550
我的天啊
For crying out loud!

999
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:03,510
她给我安排了癌症 又来找我帮忙
She gives me cancer, then she asks for my help.

1000
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:08,350
踏出这栋楼一步
The moment you set foot outside this building,

1001
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:11,020
我就有资格逮捕你
you are eligible for arrest!

1002
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,100
我们不都一样吗
As we all are...

1003
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:19,870
长官
..ma'am.

1004
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,070
瑞秋
Rachel!

1005
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,030
听我说
Listen!

1006
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,000
你根本不知道自己做了什么
You don't know what you've done.

1007
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,370
我只知道一件事
I know one thing...

1008
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,010
帕特里克·弗林讨厌「移花接木」
..Patrick Flynn hated Correction.

1009
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:50,770
-这个所谓的「移花接木」-「移花接木」项目
- And this so-called Correction...   - Correction programme.

1010
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:53,190
「移花接木」项目 你什么时候知道的
Correction programme - when were you made aware of it?

1011
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:56,030
-在我也深受其害时 -深受其害
- When I became a victim.  - A victim?

1012
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:58,940
大家可能已经注意到 我最近说了
People may have noticed there have been a number of things

1013
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:01,110
一系列不符合我性格的话
I've said out of character recently -

1014
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:04,570
一些我绝对不主张的荒谬观点 比如种族定性
absurd ideas I would never advocate. Racial profiling, for example.

1015
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:06,790
你是暗示 你那些话不是你说的吗
Are you suggesting that it wasn't you who made those comments?

1016
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:10,750
我不是暗示 我这次要让大家都听到
No, I'm not suggesting it, Khadija, I'm saying it loud and clear.

1017
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,460
特纳先生 你必须承认
Mr Turner, you have to admit that the idea of...

1018
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,920
我一直觉得你这丫头能成事儿
I always knew you were destined for greatness...

1019
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,090
-制造虚假证据 -不管以什么办法
- ..creating false evidence... - ..one way or another.

1020
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,970
你前一秒还在否认的事
..you were railing against a moment ago.

1021
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:26,640
你应该下去看看
You should get down there.

1022
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,680
你错过了一场好戏
You're missing the best bit.

1023
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:38,880
你不担心大家会把它当成
You're not worried people will think this is

1024
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,400
脑洞大开的阴谋论吗
some outlandish conspiracy theory?

1025
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,160
大家应该质疑
Well, people should question it.

1026
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,850
我们需要质疑我们看到和听到的一切
We need to challenge everything we're told and question everything we see.

1027
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:55,460
每次看到一段视频 或听到一段录音
We need to ask of every voice on every recording of every image

1028
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,870
都应该问问自己
on every screen...

1029
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,050
如何证明这是真的
..how do we know this is real?

1030
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,590
例如 在他的采访中
In his interview, for example.

1031
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,680
-虽然宣称是现场直播 -这就是现场直播
- It purports to be a live broadcast. - Well, it is a live broadcast.

1032
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,690
你能证明吗
Can you prove it?

1033
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:14,060
我可以在网上看到最新的头条
Well, I can go online, show the latest news headlines.

1034
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:17,400
好吧 我们看到了一些东西 那我呢
All right, now we're getting somewhere. But what about me?

1035
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,860
你怎么了
What about you?

1036
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:25,240
我看起来是艾萨克·特纳 听起来也是艾萨克·特纳
Well, I look like Isaac Turner, I sound like Isaac Turner.

1037
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,660
但如何确定我就是真人
How do we know I'm the real deal?

1038
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:33,460
谁又知道真正的艾萨克·特纳现在是不是
Who's to say the real Isaac Turner isn't in a car, right now,

1039
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,630
正坐车在去皮卡迪利广场的路上
on the way to Piccadilly Circus?

1040
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:48,260
谁能保证这次采访的摄像头没有被黑
Who's to say the cameras filming this interview haven't been hacked?

1041
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,800
谁又能保证 艾萨克·特纳的形象
Who's to say Isaac Turner's image

1042
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,850
没有被人工智能截获操控
hasn't been captured, animated by artificial intelligence?

1043
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:05,150
谁又知道 从采访的一开始
Who's to say, since the very start of this interview,

1044
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,860
你以为你面前的是艾萨克·特纳
while you believed you were watching Isaac Turner,

1045
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,200
实际上你看到的是我
you were, in fact, watching me -

1046
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,370
一个深伪出品的赝品
a deepfake. Fake...

1047
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:18,920
一切真假难辨
It's impossible to say.

1048
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,880
当然 如果你现在正好在皮卡迪利广场
Unless, of course, you happen to be in Piccadilly Circus right now

1049
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,610
亲眼看到了艾萨克·特纳
and can see Isaac Turner with your own eyes, then...

1050
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,190
才叫眼见为实
..perhaps you can.

1051
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:48,070
如果你在皮卡迪利广场或附近
If you are in or near Piccadilly Circus,

1052
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,700
请环顾四周
look around you.

1053
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:55,160
拿出手机 开始拍摄吧
Take out your phones and start filming.

1054
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:01,750
希望携起手来 我们能够照亮
Hopefully, together, we can shine a light on the challenges

1055
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,650
这个充斥着深伪挑战的世界
we face surrounding deepfakes.

1056
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:14,110
希望我们大家提高对非法「移花接木」技术的意识
And, hopefully, we can begin to raise awareness of the illegal practice of Correction.

1057
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:18,180
因为只有把这个阴谋公之于众
Because only by bringing this conspiracy out into the open

1058
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,640
才能正视这个问题
can we hope to confront it.

1059
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:41,080
正如大家所见 跟我一起在演播室的不是特纳议员
As you can see, I'm not in the studio with Isaac Turner MP.

1060
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:44,420
特纳先生现在正在皮卡迪利广场
Mr Turner is in Piccadilly Circus,

1061
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:46,880
在这场让大家瞠目结舌的节目中
graciously playing his part in our, hopefully,

1062
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,220
扮演着他的角色
eye-opening stunt.

1063
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:54,550
大家看到的是一场深伪采访
You have indeed been watching a deepfake interview.

1064
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,460
但刚才提到的让大家大开眼界的「移花接木」
But the alarming practice of Correction described in it

1065
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,640
都是真的
is very much real.

1066
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,140
在一群来自英国情报核心部门的吹哨人的帮助下
Working with a team of whistle-blowers from the heart of British intelligence,

1067
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,280
BBC已经取得证据
the BBC has obtained evidence that knowledge

1068
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,040
英国多个情报机构及政府高官
of the so-called Corruption programme extends across multiple UK

1069
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:23,380
都参与了所谓的「移花接木」项目
intelligence agencies and to senior members of the British government.

1070
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,450
今晚开始 我们会带来一系列独家报道
In a series of exclusive reports, starting tonight,

1071
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:32,530
详细披露这些令人不安的细节
we will be examining these alarming revelations in detail.

1072
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,600
我们会把BBC获得的证据分享给大家
We will be sharing the evidence obtained by the BBC.

1073
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:41,410
那些幕后黑手终将对此事负责
And, finally, we will be confronting those ultimately responsible.
