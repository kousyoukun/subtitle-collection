That's a beaut.

15
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:07,348
Yes, it is.

16
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:12,453
First car I bought Linda
after we got married.

17
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,722
Been sitting in the garage.

18
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:17,492
Had it towed over
this morning.

19
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,526
What's the problem?

20
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,461
Well, you know,
marriage.

21
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,463
Hard enough as it is,
and then...

22
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:24,732
when you're not living
in the house...

23
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:26,267
You meant the car, didn't you?

24
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:27,902
You want to know what's wrong
with the car?

25
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:29,791
You know I'm always here
for you, King.

26
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:30,906
Yeah.

27
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:32,307
Engine won't turn over.

28
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,375
Promised I'd get it fixed.

29
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:35,476
Know what you're doing?

30
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:36,711
Absolutely.

31
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,413
Try the key.

32
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:43,718
Say when.

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,986
Go.

34
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:47,589
Hang on.

35
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:51,492
All right, give it a go.

36
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,897
That's enough!

37
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:58,700
You know, I got
a mechanic

38
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,302
that fixed my sister's car
when no one else could.

39
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:03,671
You want his number?
I got this.

40
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,273
Dead Navy officer
in the Quarter.

41
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,008
Car was run off the road.

42
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,244
All right,
let's get to it.

43
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:10,979
What's with the car?
It's Linda's.

44
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:12,714
What's the problem?

45
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,116
Well, you know, King's not
living at home anymore.

46
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:16,818
The car, Christopher.

47
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,119
She also means

48
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,387
the car.

49
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:25,660
According to witnesses,
we've got two cars speeding

50
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:28,096
down Conti at 9:30 this morning.

51
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:30,565
Sedan traded paint with an SUV,

52
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,567
forced it into this
construction site.

53
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,135
Victim died
on impact.

54
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:35,637
So, what, road rage?

55
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,138
Something like that.

56
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,374
Got plates on the sedan?

57
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:40,642
Witnesses say
there weren't any.

58
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:42,243
Just tinted
windows, black car,

59
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,645
big dent in
the bumper.

60
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:44,912
Morning, Loretta.

61
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,881
No matter how quiet
and gentle the soul,

62
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:49,117
you get 'em behind a wheel
and suddenly they revert

63
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,551
to the most base
and primal.

64
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:52,620
I know. I've
driven with you.

65
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:55,823
Okay. From the driver's license.

66
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:59,460
The deceased is
Commander Darby Wilson.

67
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,131
Worked at the Office
of Naval Research.

68
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,399
Local guy.

69
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,900
Born and raised
in Metairie.

70
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:07,468
We could play
Guess the Cause of Death,

71
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,037
but the giant rebar

72
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,372
sticking
through our victim's chest

73
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:12,907
makes the game
kind of pointless.

74
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:16,611
They put out the
flames fairly quickly.

75
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,480
Luckily, the corpse
is mostly intact.

76
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,052
What do we got here?

77
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,158
Receipt says
it was purchased last night.

78
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,260
6:12 p.m.

79
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:33,561
I never understood
the appeal

80
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:36,130
of jewelry.
Expensive, easy to lose,

81
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,033
and doesn't do anything but
just sit on your body.

82
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,269
Says the perennial bachelor.

83
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:44,272
My mother had a locket
with my father's picture from...

84
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:46,808
when he was in boot camp
before Vietnam.

85
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,977
The point of a locket
isn't the jewelry itself.

86
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,214
It's what the giver chooses
to put inside.

87
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:59,454
To be determined.

88
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:01,456
I'll put a BOLO out
on that sedan.

89
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,857
See if any
surveillance cameras get us

90
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,058
a better look
at the driver.

91
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,226
Something else, Dwayne.

92
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:08,329
He's got bare feet.

93
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,098
His shoes are nowhere
in the car.

94
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,333
Who gets in a car

95
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,168
without shoes?

96
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,536
Someone in a rush.

97
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,741
Let's assume
that whatever ended here

98
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:21,442
started somewhere else.

99
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:24,712
Where the hell
was he coming from?

100
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:27,382
Got a GPS.

101
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,984
Which means...

102
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,788
...I can do my thing.

103
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,725
<i>39163 Delgado Avenue.</i>

104
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:39,527
<i>Commander Wilson's house?</i>

105
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,296
<i>Matches the address</i>
<i>on his license.</i>

106
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,501
Hey, listen to this.

107
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:50,138
Wilson was 40 years old,
already made commander.

108
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,673
Tours in Iraq, Afghanistan.
Numerous commendations.

109
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,709
And he could be dead
'cause someone couldn't handle

110
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,278
getting cut off in traffic.
Hey.

111
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:07,355
On my lead.

112
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:13,094
NCIS!

113
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,479
Clear.

114
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:33,915
Chris.

115
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:04,011
So it's not likely this has
anything to do with road rage.

116
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:08,649
Nope. Something
much bigger going on.

117
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,525
Busy morning.

118
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:24,893
You're telling me.

119
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:26,181
We got any more
on our victim?

120
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:28,449
Our first victim?
Yeah.

121
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:29,884
Commander Wilson's assignment
with the Office

122
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:31,385
of Naval Research
had him working

123
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:34,155
as a technical liaison
for private developers.

124
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:36,057
Special access,
top secret clearance.

125
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:38,092
Take his computer. Call in...
Patton Plame.

126
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:39,760
I'll get him
to run a diagnostic.

127
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:41,629
And our second victim.

128
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,965
She's, what,
Commander Wilson's wife?

129
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,466
That would be a no.

130
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,335
This is Commander Wilson's wife.

131
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:52,106
Katherine Wilson.
The naked woman in the bathroom

132
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:53,574
<i>is Rebecca Ortega.</i>

133
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:55,576
She's Wilson's assistant
at the ONR.

134
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:57,645
Found her purse
in the kitchen.

135
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:02,717
One gunshot to the head,
one to the neck.

136
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:05,119
Clean entry wounds.
My guess-- nine-millimeter.

137
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:06,320
Time of death?

138
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:08,956
Based on rigor, 9:00, 9:15.

139
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,526
Less than 15 minutes
before Commander Wilson dies

140
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:13,227
in the crash.

141
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:16,097
Who else finds it odd that
an assistant is taking a bath

142
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:18,432
at her boss's house
at 9:00 in the morning?

143
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:19,967
And if the
commander's wife knew

144
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:23,037
what was going on,
wonder how she'd react.

145
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:25,973
Before I forget,

146
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:28,142
it's the number to the
mechanic I told you about.

147
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:29,844
No, thanks. I'm good.

148
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:33,381
I'm telling you, King, this
guy can get a turtle to run.

149
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:36,317
And I'm telling you
I got this, Christopher.

150
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:40,955
Bart Roberts.
He lives next door.

151
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:43,457
Tell Agent Pride here about
Commander Wilson and his wife.

152
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:47,361
Well, that was a couple
that just loved to argue.

153
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:50,131
Bart says
that Wilson's assistant Rebecca

154
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:52,333
spent some late nights here.

155
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:53,701
They in a relationship?

156
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:56,671
Well, I can't say that for sure,

157
00:07:56,673 --> 00:07:58,606
but alls I will say is...

158
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,875
I would've tapped that.

159
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:06,013
I mean, God rest her soul
and all that.

160
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:08,716
You have a good day now.

161
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:12,320
So, we've got a marriage
on the rocks,

162
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:14,889
husband seems to be
having an affair.

163
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:16,757
Disgruntled wife shoots
husband's lover

164
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,626
and then runs him
off the road.

165
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:19,961
Or gets someone else to.

166
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:21,596
See this blood?
It came off a shoe.

167
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:23,664
I sprayed it with BlueStar.
Look at the size.

168
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,200
Big. Not a woman's.

169
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:27,868
It wasn't from the commander.
He was barefoot.

170
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,004
I found some more blood spots
in the hall, too.

171
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:31,305
Shoe prints match.

172
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:34,308
So, wife gets someone
to do the deed.

173
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,346
He shoots Rebecca
in the bathroom,

174
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:39,647
but the commander
was able to escape,

175
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,048
flees the house.

176
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,317
Bad guy follows,
gets to the car,

177
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:45,119
ends in a crash.

178
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:47,088
All right.

179
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,056
Start with the wife's
personal assets.

180
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:53,728
See if she had the finances
to pay someone to do this.

181
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,797
$20,000 withdrawn from
Katherine Wilson's bank account

182
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,633
48 hours ago.

183
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,568
Enough to get you a hired gun.

184
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,639
Hey, King,

185
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:07,341
who are the uniforms?

186
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:10,144
Intelligence specialists
out of Belle Chasse.

187
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:12,813
Revamp on their HQ
just started.

188
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:13,981
Until it's done,
I told them

189
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,517
they could have
offices in the back.

190
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,520
By the way, got a response

191
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:20,621
from the Office
of Naval Research.

192
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:21,856
"Given the access

193
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:23,491
"the commander had,
we are concerned

194
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,126
"about the sensitive information

195
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:27,161
that might have been
taken off his home computer."

196
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:28,763
If they're concerned,

197
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:30,631
I want to know
who they're concerned about.

198
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,333
You two go to ONR.

199
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:35,202
I'll talk to the $20,000 wife.

200
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:37,705
You looked into my bank records?

201
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,940
We did.

202
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:42,143
Mind explaining why...

203
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:44,612
you withdrew
$20,000 last week?

204
00:09:44,614 --> 00:09:48,015
My husband is dead,
and you're questioning...

205
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:50,051
my finances?

206
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:53,187
We're required
to cover our bases, Mrs. Wilson.

207
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:54,889
I didn't kill my husband.

208
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:56,390
We were having issues, yes.

209
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:59,060
I saw him yesterday
at the house

210
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:01,262
to go over the terms
of our divorce.

211
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:02,730
Was it contentious?

212
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:05,666
It's divorce.

213
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:07,568
And nothing more?

214
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,602
Meaning?

215
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:11,472
The other victim at the house,

216
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:13,174
the woman who
was killed.

217
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:17,078
Rebecca. Yes, I heard.

218
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,613
She was there early
in the morning.

219
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:22,049
Odd time for an assistant
to be with a boss.

220
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:25,553
And...
there was this.

221
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:29,890
In his car.

222
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,594
Recognize it?

223
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:38,899
Any idea who it was for?

224
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:41,869
Not for me, it seems.

225
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:47,541
Unless you'd like
to arrest me...

226
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:50,578
I think I should
probably go start

227
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,913
planning my husband's funeral.

228
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:02,556
<i>We're... in shock.</i>

229
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:05,559
Commander Wilson
and Rebecca were...

230
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,027
amazing people.

231
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,130
Commander Wilson had...

232
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:11,599
a bright future in the service.

233
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:14,769
What kind of sensitive Intel
was the commander privy to?

234
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:16,837
Drones, missile defense,

235
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:18,706
all the latest
technology.

236
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,808
Any issues there
or breaches of intelligence

237
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,309
with Commander Wilson?

238
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:23,878
Well, I'd love
to talk specifics,

239
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,980
but that information's
classified.

240
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:27,982
Is there anything
you could offer us?

241
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:30,351
Darby and Rebecca spent
much of the past year on-site

242
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:31,919
with a private
defense contractor.

243
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:34,021
Uh, Axelrod Industries.

244
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:36,190
If there were issues,
they'd be someone

245
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:37,658
you should talk to.

246
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,193
One other question.

247
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:41,762
Did you get a sense
that Commander Wilson

248
00:11:41,764 --> 00:11:44,365
and Ms. Ortega's relationship
extended beyond work?

249
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:48,302
Um, excuse me. The admiral's
requesting your signature.

250
00:11:48,304 --> 00:11:51,038
Darby and Rebecca
were close, but...

251
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
given our strict
disclosure policies,

252
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:55,576
they'd have to come to us
with a relationship.

253
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:57,711
Or keep it an office secret.

254
00:11:57,713 --> 00:11:59,780
I suppose anything's
possible.

255
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:02,249
We're going to need
to bag and tag

256
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:03,684
the files, the tablet,

257
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:05,386
everything in the
commander's office.

258
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:07,321
Excuse me.

259
00:12:07,323 --> 00:12:08,856
Miss?

260
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:12,026
Special Agent Brody with NCIS.

261
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:14,094
I was wondering
if there was something

262
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:15,763
you might want to tell me.

263
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:19,233
I... I don't.

264
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:21,969
Just needed a signature at ?

265
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:24,004
Time-sensitive?

266
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:31,545
There was nothing going on
between Darby and Rebecca.

267
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:32,847
How do you know that?

268
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:36,817
Because I'm the office secret.

269
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:38,085
You and Darby?

270
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:41,889
Me and Becca.

271
00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:46,594
Darby and Becca
were very close.

272
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:49,597
They worked crazy
hours together.

273
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:53,167
She slept there some
nights, but trust me...

274
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:58,038
...Rebecca wasn't into him.

275
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,675
I'm in so much pain.

276
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:06,547
I mean, we were in love,
and now she's...

277
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:08,749
she's...

278
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:11,952
...gone.

279
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:14,722
I'm so sorry for your loss.

280
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:20,060
So there was
no affair?

281
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:23,530
Which doesn't mean the wife
didn't think there was.

282
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:26,600
And I'd like to know more
about that withdrawal.

283
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:29,937
But she didn't strike me as
the kind of lady that would...

284
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:32,206
bump off two people
on a hunch.

285
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,174
Ah, speaking
of hunches--

286
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:36,310
and I don't know
what this means--

287
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:40,814
but I found a small patch
of a sticky substance

288
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:44,151
on the commander's right wrist.

289
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:45,519
Run any tests?

290
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:48,555
The old-fashioned kind: smell.

291
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,959
Tobacco?

292
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,560
Mm-hmm. In resin form.

293
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:55,562
Which is odd,
because the commander

294
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:57,698
has the cleanest lungs
I've ever seen.

295
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,300
Makes you wonder:

296
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:04,204
Why is it there, and where
exactly did it come from?

297
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:06,273
Sebastian's running
further tests that resin

298
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:07,775
so we could learn more.

299
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:10,110
Nobody move.

300
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:11,912
Speaking of...

301
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:14,715
Hotter.

302
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:16,317
Hotter.

303
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,719
That's colder.

304
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:20,020
What are we doing?

305
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:21,622
Trying to beat back
the prying eyes

306
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:22,756
of our great overlords.

307
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,626
Sebastian.

308
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:27,995
Sorry. It's my
anti-hacking app.

309
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:30,130
When someone tries to steal
information from my phone,

310
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:32,066
the app starts beeping,
and it's telling me

311
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:35,202
that the source of the hack
is somewhere in this room.

312
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:36,804
Hotter.

313
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:40,174
Hotter.

314
00:14:40,176 --> 00:14:42,810
Singeing.

315
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:47,014
Inferno.

316
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:49,416
Um...

317
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:53,287
it's saying that the source
is inside the body.

318
00:14:54,122 --> 00:14:56,256
In the body?

319
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,692
Yeah. Uh, there.

320
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:00,594
Right... there.

321
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,271
I was just
about to check

322
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:13,707
the contents of the
stomach anyway.

323
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:22,349
Oh.

324
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:25,986
Something's imbedded
in the stomach lining.

325
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:32,793
Looks like a microchip.

326
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:35,529
May I see that
for a second?

327
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,167
Oh, wow.

328
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:41,935
Seriously,
like, wow.

329
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:44,405
I-I had heard this kind
of thing was in development,

330
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:47,574
but to actually see one... Wow.

331
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:49,710
See one what, Sebastian?

332
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:51,712
Uh, a biotracker.

333
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:53,433
It's a spy tool--

334
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:54,649
something that you put
inside another person.

335
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,418
And then when that person
is near an electronic signal,

336
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,321
like a computer or a phone, the
biotracker steals that signal.

337
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:03,924
Phone calls are tapped,
e-mails are hijacked.

338
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:06,660
Like swallowing
a recording device?

339
00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:09,997
Yeah.
So what you're saying...

340
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:13,133
Commander Wilson
was being spied on?

341
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:16,136
I am saying that Commander
Wilson was being spied on...

342
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:19,573
from inside
his own body.

343
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,025
Biotracker is the purest fusion
of biology and electronics.

344
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,491
There's a whole branch of tech

345
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,526
devoted to craziness
just like this.

346
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,128
It's all the rage
with guys like me.

347
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,529
Hackers like you.

348
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:42,631
Investigative
computer specialists.

349
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,033
Too legit to quit.

350
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:46,135
Okay, MC Hammer,

351
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:47,970
how do you get a
biotracker into someone?

352
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:49,972
Well, as you can see,
they're very tiny.

353
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:51,507
Normally,
they're hidden in a pill.

354
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,377
Any chance he could have
swallowed it himself?

355
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,045
Not unless
he's a crazy-ass.

356
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:58,080
Those things are not tested;
they're dangerous.

357
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,815
Commander Wilson was
on cholesterol meds.

358
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,550
Maybe somebody slipped
the biotracker

359
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:03,486
into one of those?
Uh...

360
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,888
they might have planted trackers
in multiple pills.

361
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,356
Like anything
other than...

362
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,158
cheese, biotrackers can pass

363
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,893
through your system within days.

364
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,895
So the info
the biotracker steals

365
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:15,667
can be transmitted somewhere--
can you track where it goes?

366
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,910
Nah. That's beyond
even my considerable powers.

367
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:18,835
But this is not

368
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,669
something a jealous wife
would be using?

369
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:21,904
Not unless she's a wife with

370
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:23,539
multimillions
in research funding.

371
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,841
The people who work with the ONR
have those resources.

372
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:27,576
And the place
Wilson was assigned--

373
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:30,312
Axelrod Industries.
I'll take Axelrod.

374
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:32,581
You two figure out who,
other than his wife,

375
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,183
had access to his meds.

376
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:36,519
How you doing with
Wilson's computer?

377
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:38,487
Oh, I'm into it.

378
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:39,889
I'll tell you what,

379
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:42,525
this puppy is buttoned up
tighter than a...

380
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,093
very...

381
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:45,594
tightly...

382
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,263
buttoned-up puppy.

383
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,468
Okay, I got lost
in the middle of that one.

384
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:58,441
Agent Pride.
Welcome.

385
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,776
Oscar Randolph,
head of security.

386
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:03,179
Got to do this sweep.
My apologies.

387
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,281
Understood.

388
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:06,549
At this point,
we're trying to learn

389
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:07,716
everything we can
about the work

390
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,185
Commander Wilson
was involved in.

391
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:10,820
Right. So, he was
the go-between

392
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:13,456
on a number of projects we
were building for the Navy.

393
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,458
Darby was charged
with helping us

394
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,160
integrate the work into
the Navy's systems.

395
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:20,095
Laser-based
helicopter landing aid,

396
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:22,097
hypervelocity
missile system...

397
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:23,566
How about biotrackers?

398
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:25,701
Not on our radar.

399
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:28,270
But they're cool.

400
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:30,139
Agent Pride, do you
think they were killed

401
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:31,373
because of Darby's
work here?

402
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,209
We're exploring
all possibilities.

403
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,211
You'd be right
to be concerned.

404
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:37,546
My employees have had
issues in the past.

405
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:39,882
Routine attempts
at hacking into our system,

406
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:43,018
extortion, espionage...
Terrorist organizations?

407
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,021
From al-Qaeda to the Red Hacker
Alliance out of Beijing.

408
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:47,723
Our employees have targets
on their backs-- that's why

409
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:49,492
we do everything in our power
to keep them safe.

410
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:51,760
But the truth is,
the technologies we develop

411
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:53,362
are <i>the</i> cutting edge.

412
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:55,064
They're worth killing for--

413
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,932
a fact we're,
admittedly,

414
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,501
quite proud of.

415
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,740
Here's my problem.

416
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:06,876
It's hard to investigate
what's not there anymore.

417
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,711
Darby's entire system
was wiped remotely

418
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:10,346
three hours
after his death.

419
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:11,747
So all gone?

420
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:13,315
Gone, but not
really gone.

421
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:15,317
See, gone is never
totally gone.

422
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,685
I use some...

423
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:18,754
complier code, maybe
a packet sniffer.

424
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:20,055
If I'm lucky,

425
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:21,857
I'll find a zero day exploit.

426
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,692
And here's where
I pretend like I know

427
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:25,094
what that means.
Oh, it means,

428
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:26,662
I'm gonna be on it,

429
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,430
like a woman on a bicycle,

430
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:29,899
with somewhere to go.

431
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:31,634
Analogies are
not your strong suit.

432
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:33,202
The lab wants us.

433
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,742
Afternoon, friends.

434
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:41,744
Mr. Lund.

435
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,445
Mr. Plame.

436
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:45,147
How's my favorite
conspiracy theorist doing?

437
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:47,716
I prefer the term
"creative realist."

438
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:50,119
Well, not many realists I know
believe that the government

439
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:53,622
is developing time travel
technology in Area 51.

440
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:55,090
Yeah, not many skeptics I know
have read

441
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:56,392
the redacted files
that I have, so...

442
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,294
There is a reason
you called?

443
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:01,330
Yes. The substance
found on Wilson's wrist

444
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:03,098
was, in fact, tobacco resin.

445
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,067
I isolated
the cotinine properties

446
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:06,602
and found that
this particular type,

447
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:08,103
the Roman Shisha,
is somewhat rare.

448
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,039
It's also only used
for hookah smoking.

449
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,607
It's only sold
in a few local spots.

450
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:13,442
And the resin can be
wiped out quite easily,

451
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:14,777
but it was still
on Commander Wilson,

452
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,845
which means he likely
encountered it

453
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,480
within hours
of his death.

454
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,649
Yeah, so I grabbed the log
that Lasalle downloaded

455
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:22,518
from the GPS
in Commander Wilson's car,

456
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,354
and I cross-referenced it
with hookah bars in the city...

457
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:28,157
And... boom-Shaka.

458
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,425
Boom what?

459
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:30,459
Boom-Shaka. I'm just...

460
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:31,694
I'm working on catchphrases

461
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:33,395
to punctuate
meaningful discoveries.

462
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,397
And in this case,
that discovery would be...?

463
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:37,399
That Commander Wilson parked
his car near a place called

464
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:40,169
the Sahara Room at 10:00 p.m.
the night before he died.

465
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,771
Late meeting in a hookah bar?

466
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,708
By a nonsmoker.
Well, it ain't time travel

467
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,643
at Area 51, but still it's odd.

468
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:49,178
Okay, I'm telling you
it's a real...

469
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,246
And how this is all
connected with the world

470
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:53,315
of biotrackers and high technology?
I don't know,

471
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:55,517
but it's worth looking
into. Sebastian.

472
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,300
Yeah?

473
00:20:56,324 --> 00:20:57,854
Send me the address
to that hookah bar.

474
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:00,789
I got you.

475
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,926
Surveillance camera
footage from Sahara East.

476
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:06,261
Hostess says
Commander Wilson was there

477
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:07,863
meeting this guy.

478
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:10,666
They were having
an intense conversation.

479
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:13,736
But hostess couldn't hear them,
'cause they were whispering.

480
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,471
He looks like a
burnt marshmallow.

481
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:18,007
Camera had an inch of
dust over the lens.

482
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,909
Even Bruce is stumped.

483
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:23,879
Think Bruce could fix the car?

484
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:25,247
Only I call him Bruce.

485
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,815
Pride ever consider
a mechanic?

486
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:28,584
I asked. He said no.

487
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,719
I don't get it. I've only
known Pride a couple months,

488
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:33,030
but it seems like if he
wanted to get it fixed...

489
00:21:33,054 --> 00:21:33,757
He wouldn't be

490
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:36,091
snapping at me for giving him
the number of my mechanic.

491
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:38,160
Incoming.

492
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,530
Anything on
the surveillance video?

493
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:43,866
Nope. No, sir. Nada.

494
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:47,770
Question: When exactly did
Wilson meet our mystery man?

495
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:51,407
Time stamp says the night
before the murder, 10:06 p.m.

496
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,308
Wilson's wife mentioned
meeting her husband

497
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,345
earlier that same day.

498
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:57,746
Wonder if Wilson
told her anything

499
00:21:57,748 --> 00:21:58,814
about his other meeting.

500
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:01,016
Never hurts to ask.

501
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,917
Christopher?

502
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,685
Hey, King, what you got?

503
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:39,588
Christopher, I got the car
that chased Commander Wilson

504
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,024
parked in front of
the wife's house.

505
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:45,694
- Gonna need backup.
- On our way.

506
00:22:46,996 --> 00:22:48,697
NCIS.

507
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:04,346
You okay?
Yeah.

508
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:07,149
All right, stay here.

509
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:53,700
You okay?

510
00:23:53,702 --> 00:23:56,303
I don't get any of this.

511
00:23:56,305 --> 00:23:59,806
The-the person
who murdered my husband

512
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:01,441
is also coming after me?

513
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:04,678
At the moment,
we're focused on the possibility

514
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,581
that something about
your husband's work

515
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,483
was the reason for his death.

516
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:12,019
Is there anything
he might have

517
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,888
told you or left at your house
or-or gave you to keep

518
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,724
that could put you in danger?

519
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:20,327
No. No, he hasn't been
to my house in weeks,

520
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:22,696
and we don't really talk much.

521
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:25,699
Certainly not
about his work.

522
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:28,101
BOLO's out based on
Mrs. Wilson's description.

523
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:30,537
Got eyes on the ground
and in the air.

524
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,606
Don't worry, ma'am,
we'll find the guy.

525
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:36,743
Katherine, I need you
to remember anything you can.

526
00:24:36,745 --> 00:24:38,879
Uh, it just happened
really fast.

527
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:41,081
I mean, I'm trying. I...

528
00:24:42,617 --> 00:24:45,152
I came home, and...

529
00:24:45,154 --> 00:24:47,487
he was there.

530
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:52,359
He grabbed me by my hair,
and he...

531
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:56,730
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

532
00:24:56,732 --> 00:24:58,932
It's all right. You're safe now.

533
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:05,305
Just one more question.
Okay.

534
00:25:05,307 --> 00:25:07,607
The last time
you saw your husband,

535
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,977
did he mention anything
about meeting someone

536
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:12,512
later in the day?

537
00:25:12,514 --> 00:25:13,980
Shang. He's this... I...

538
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:16,717
Someone named Shang. He...

539
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:18,051
said he was a colleague.

540
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:19,453
All right, all right,

541
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:21,288
that's good, that's good.

542
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:24,558
Add Shang to the BOLO.

543
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,193
And I'll talk to ONR.

544
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:28,962
Cross-reference the name against
anyone Wilson worked with.

545
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:31,732
Yeah. Two murders

546
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:33,834
and an attempt
on Mrs. Wilson.

547
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:36,336
I think it's time maybe
we move her to the safe house

548
00:25:36,338 --> 00:25:38,038
till the killer's
in custody.

549
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,740
I'll set it up.

550
00:25:39,742 --> 00:25:41,508
Have Brody pack her a bag.

551
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,744
You got it, King.

552
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:56,656
You mind taking
a couple steps back?

553
00:25:56,658 --> 00:25:58,725
Just a precaution.

554
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:03,897
I used to have a radio
like this growing up.

555
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:08,935
Turn it up real loud
when my parents would argue.

556
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:10,670
Mom drank too much,

557
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:12,172
Dad yelled and the music
just made it easier.

558
00:26:20,816 --> 00:26:23,817
♪ I know it's hard to love me ♪
There.

559
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:26,720
I love that song.

560
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:30,991
♪ But you sure enough
did try... ♪

561
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:33,293
Darby didn't like music.

562
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:37,297
He was no-nonsense.
Always on point.

563
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:41,401
Which, when
I met him, I loved.

564
00:26:41,403 --> 00:26:43,537
But time passes

565
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:48,041
and the differences
you fell in love with just...

566
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:50,277
oh, start to be differences.

567
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:53,647
You're married.

568
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:56,016
I am.

569
00:26:56,018 --> 00:26:57,884
You know what I'm talking about.

570
00:26:57,886 --> 00:26:59,252
Yeah, it's tough

571
00:26:59,254 --> 00:27:01,188
when things get broken.

572
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,224
You hungry?

573
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:07,427
Yeah, I don't think
I've eaten in days.

574
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:09,396
We got...

575
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,798
peanut butter,
rice, baked beans

576
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,600
and a can of salsa.

577
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:15,335
You can make a meal out of that?

578
00:27:15,337 --> 00:27:17,537
You don't know
who you're talking to.

579
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:21,441
Thanks, Brody.

580
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:23,009
The intelligence
specialists--

581
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:24,311
they took my potato salad,

582
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:25,712
didn't even ask.

583
00:27:25,714 --> 00:27:27,080
Come on.

584
00:27:27,082 --> 00:27:28,648
Well, you don't
eat potato salad,

585
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,851
I didn't eat it,
and King ain't here.

586
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:32,385
That leaves us one option.

587
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:34,087
We got thieves
in our midst.

588
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:35,789
They made coffee.
That's nice.

589
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:39,626
Whatever.

590
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:42,462
Here we go.

591
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,763
Meet Shang Lee.

592
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:46,099
Commander Wilson's
colleague.

593
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:47,767
Wilson's friend
from the hookah bar.

594
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:49,603
Shang used to work
at Axelrod Industries--

595
00:27:49,605 --> 00:27:51,705
technology officer.

596
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:54,174
Mr. Axelrod says
he fired Shang a year ago.

597
00:27:54,176 --> 00:27:56,276
Accused him of trying to sell
blueprints to a competitor.

598
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:58,278
Could be what the
biotracker is about.

599
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,181
An attempt to learn
what Wilson was working on

600
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:03,516
at Axelrod so Shang
could resell it.

601
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:05,051
Maybe Wilson finds out...

602
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:06,419
Shang has to silence him.

603
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:07,754
Where's Shang Lee now?

604
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:08,989
Looks like he's in the wind.

605
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,824
Well, let's find him.

606
00:28:10,826 --> 00:28:13,059
And whoever stole
my potato salad.

607
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:17,230
There are billions
of galaxies out there.

608
00:28:17,232 --> 00:28:18,565
How can you not believe

609
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:20,333
in the existence
of extraterrestrial life?

610
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:22,535
I mean, there are billions of
opportunities for life to grow.

611
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:24,104
Billions of...
Sebastian, I invited you

612
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:26,239
to help me, not to say
"billions" a billion times.

613
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:28,308
We just... We can't be
the only pebble in space

614
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,744
whose inhabitants get their
celestial groove on, you know?

615
00:28:30,746 --> 00:28:32,512
Whose fish
swim upstream.

616
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:34,014
Whose sole purpose

617
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:36,883
is to procreate and continue
a dysfunctional species.

618
00:28:36,885 --> 00:28:38,885
Any progress
with Wilson's computer?

619
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:41,755
We're getting there. Sebastian
actually had a decent thought.

620
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:43,356
Potato salad.

621
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:44,624
Want some?

622
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:46,826
So, to get into

623
00:28:46,828 --> 00:28:48,495
encrypted Area 51 files,

624
00:28:48,497 --> 00:28:50,730
hackers used a neural
network decryption algorithm.

625
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:53,133
Allegedly. Anyway,

626
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:55,502
we applied the same
algorithm to the commander's

627
00:28:55,504 --> 00:28:57,470
- computer and...
Boom-a-bam-bam.

628
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,942
Boom-diggidy.

629
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:02,944
That's...

630
00:29:02,945 --> 00:29:04,110
Boom-vroom?

631
00:29:04,112 --> 00:29:06,880
Don't ever say that again.

632
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:08,882
All right.

633
00:29:08,884 --> 00:29:10,717
We got Commander Wilson's
download history.

634
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:14,154
His last download was 8:30,
about an hour before he died.

635
00:29:14,156 --> 00:29:16,456
He put some files on an SD card.

636
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,249
What was on the files?

637
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:19,273
We don't know yet-- a lot
of layers of encryption.

638
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:22,295
Looked like some
classified stuff.

639
00:29:22,297 --> 00:29:23,797
But we're getting into it.

640
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:32,639
Seconds?

641
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:34,908
I got to admit, the
food's not terrible.

642
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,477
High praise.

643
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,012
What you got there?

644
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:43,917
Found it in the cabinet.

645
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,252
Thought this was a
secure safe house.

646
00:29:46,254 --> 00:29:48,254
We share it with
other agencies.

647
00:29:48,256 --> 00:29:49,889
Can't vouch for everyone.

648
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:52,092
Is it okay if I...
You can.

649
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:54,394
No. I'm the one with the gun.

650
00:29:54,396 --> 00:29:56,096
Got to take a pass.

651
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:08,108
Darby took a cooking class once.

652
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,310
He was so bad.

653
00:30:11,746 --> 00:30:14,280
I mean, he really tried.
It was sweet.

654
00:30:14,282 --> 00:30:16,616
He wanted to learn my favorite
food-- beef bourguignon--

655
00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:17,984
and cook it for my birthday.

656
00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:20,086
Sounds like a good guy.

657
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:22,188
He was.

658
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:26,092
I didn't want it to end.

659
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:28,661
With Darby.

660
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:30,797
The divorce was...

661
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,966
all we could think to do.

662
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:37,904
Couple weeks ago, I tried
signing up for an online

663
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:40,240
dating service,

664
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:44,711
but when I went
to complete the profile, I...

665
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:47,514
couldn't do it.

666
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:49,115
Somehow that step--

667
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:51,451
more than the divorce, even--

668
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:52,919
felt like...

669
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,721
A line you...

670
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:57,190
just can't uncross.

671
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:00,960
You get it.

672
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:12,639
Katherine.

673
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:15,208
I...

674
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,082
I need to deal with this.
Uh, yeah, of course.

675
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:29,923
<i>One of the stable hands</i>
<i>found him.</i>

676
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:33,359
Was shoeing a horse,
noticed this horrible smell.

677
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:36,029
Kind of like... spoiled cheese.

678
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:37,997
Use these
stables much?

679
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:39,766
Not in years.

680
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:42,669
This is a great place to hide
something you don't want found.

681
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:44,971
Thank you, sir.

682
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:47,073
There's the smell.

683
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:49,175
Definitely... spoiled cheese.

684
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:50,743
Good afternoon, Loretta.

685
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:53,413
Brody, Christopher, come
meet Shang Lee in the flesh.

686
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:56,049
Rotting as it is.

687
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:02,155
We found him submerged
in this trough of fetid water.

688
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:04,824
Cause of death is
two gunshot wounds to the chest.

689
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:06,993
Caliber appears to
be nine millimeter.

690
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:09,195
Same weapon
that killed Rebecca Ortega.

691
00:32:09,197 --> 00:32:12,198
I'll have Sebastian check
ballistics, but I'm guessing...

692
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,501
Striations match.

693
00:32:14,503 --> 00:32:16,569
Time of death?

694
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:20,773
Based on decomp, bloating and
lividity, I'd say Shang Lee

695
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:23,610
died hours before
the other two victims.

696
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:25,745
Might want to call Pride.

697
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:28,414
Tell him the killer's
still on the loose.

698
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:33,520
Yeah. Well, do that.

699
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,757
I take it that call doesn't
mean the danger's over?

700
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:42,228
Not yet, no.

701
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,733
Get down!

702
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:29,055
<i>So, what happens now?</i>

703
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:32,858
If... whoever it is...

704
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,561
can find you out here
in the middle of nowhere,

705
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:38,064
it's better we bring
you back to the office.

706
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,398
More security.

707
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,068
We'll keep you
under 24-hour watch.

708
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,938
Listen, I'm...

709
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,807
sorry about... before.

710
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,843
Don't give it
another thought.

711
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:55,781
Can I ask you a question?

712
00:33:56,783 --> 00:33:58,351
Where'd you get that bracelet?

713
00:33:58,353 --> 00:34:00,519
Darby, my 30th.

714
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:01,787
Your earrings?

715
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:04,924
Yeah, Darby, also.
All silver?

716
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:07,159
It's the only kind
of jewelry I can wear

717
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:08,694
without breaking into hives.

718
00:34:08,696 --> 00:34:11,397
That's what the
locket was made of.

719
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:17,570
It clearly was
not for Rebecca.

720
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:20,239
It matches everything
else you wear, and...

721
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:22,508
You think he...
He bought it for you.

722
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:26,746
And maybe

723
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:29,749
it became the perfect
hiding place for something else.

724
00:34:31,585 --> 00:34:34,286
The only thing he took
as he ran for his life

725
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:36,856
was the necklace.

726
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:41,927
And an SD card
can be very small.

727
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:47,299
Pride says recheck the locket.

728
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:50,770
I thought
he checked it at the scene.

729
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:52,238
Nothing in here.

730
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:55,307
How big is an SD card?

731
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:57,410
Can be about the size
of your thumbnail.

732
00:34:57,412 --> 00:34:59,779
This thing's stuck.

733
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:02,014
May I?
Absolutely.

734
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:06,252
So, my mother was always worried
about losing her locket.

735
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:09,789
This is what she would do
with a faulty clasp.

736
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:13,325
Mm. Yeah.

737
00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:17,363
Looks like
there's something in there.

738
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,701
How do you like them apples?

739
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,703
Let me get that, kids.

740
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,506
Let's see
what all this killing is about.

741
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:33,079
Okay. Here we go.

742
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:40,653
What the hell is this?

743
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:46,759
So, that ain't good.

744
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:48,594
Wait a minute.

745
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:51,630
There's another file on here.

746
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:56,235
It's a memo. It's unfinished.

747
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,970
Dated two days
before Wilson's death...

748
00:35:57,972 --> 00:35:59,738
to the Navy.

749
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,142
Wilson was accidentally cc'd

750
00:36:03,144 --> 00:36:07,379
on an e-mail with a video
of Axelrod's missile system.

751
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:09,515
There's a defect
with the targeting mechanism,

752
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:11,350
but he's waiting
on a second opinion

753
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:13,486
before notifying
his superior officer.

754
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:17,656
Shang Lee could have been
that second opinion.

755
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:19,158
He knew how Axelrod worked.

756
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,860
They're cleaning up
all their loose ends,

757
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:23,329
which is probably why
they went after Katherine.

758
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:26,599
She met with Wilson at his house
the day before he died.

759
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,801
Must be scared
they told her something.

760
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:30,336
Yeah, but the question is:

761
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:32,104
Who at Axelrod
screwed up big-time,

762
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,406
sent that e-mail, and then
tried to cover their tracks?

763
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,408
I'm on it.

764
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:44,416
This is great.
Just send me the specs.

765
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:46,485
NCIS. Don't move.

766
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:47,686
Whoa. What are you doing?

767
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:49,655
Hey.

768
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:52,458
Miss Schwartz,
you need to come with us.

769
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,228
Wait. What?

770
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,131
Jason, I'm sure
this is a terrible mistake.

771
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:05,437
This is insane. I don't know
what you're thinking,

772
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,640
but I can promise you,
you have the wrong person.

773
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,042
Hold that thought, please.

774
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:20,219
You recognize him?

775
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:24,223
Allow me
to refresh your memory.

776
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:26,392
Oscar Randolph, head of security
for your company,

777
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:29,061
the man you e-mailed
ten minutes after you realized

778
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:30,529
Commander Wilson
had accidentally

779
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:32,198
received the failed
missile test.

780
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,134
Ex-paramilitary,
trained killer,

781
00:37:35,136 --> 00:37:38,304
experience using nine-millimeter
and sniper weaponry.

782
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:40,372
Shoe size matches
the prints we found.

783
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:42,107
And he sings
like a canary.

784
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:44,710
About biotrackers
in cholesterol meds

785
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:46,178
kept at work,

786
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,713
murder for hire,

787
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:49,248
and lost million-dollar bonuses

788
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,283
if a missile deal
were to go south.

789
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,391
Here's the deal.

790
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:01,727
You talk before Agent Pride gets
in this room,

791
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:04,496
and we'll tell the judge to show
leniency; you stay silent...

792
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:06,298
Take your chances
with the needle.

793
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,238
Okay, please, please, please.

794
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,006
You have to know,
I never told him

795
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:16,008
to kill Rebecca.
She wasn't supposed to be there.

796
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,476
You'll tell the judge that,
right?

797
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:22,414
Mr. Randolph in there--

798
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,083
he... he wants his lawyer.

799
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:25,918
He's not talking.

800
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,753
Wait. What?!

801
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:29,421
Yep. Conversation

802
00:38:29,423 --> 00:38:32,758
wasn't very fruitful,
but it did give me

803
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,894
time to put together
my grocery list.

804
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,097
Need anything?

805
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:51,610
Katherine?

806
00:38:53,313 --> 00:38:55,414
You can go home now.

807
00:38:56,383 --> 00:38:58,317
It's over?

808
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:04,123
Nothing else
to worry about.

809
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,094
I got to say, though,

810
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,664
protective custody
has its advantages.

811
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,666
Company wasn't half bad.

812
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:21,907
Oh. I thought you might
like to have it.

813
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:39,925
Looks nice.

814
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:42,695
Darby had good taste.

815
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:48,033
I should go.

816
00:40:15,628 --> 00:40:17,629
You still at it?

817
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:19,898
Yeah. Cars can be stubborn.

818
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,068
That ain't the only thing.

819
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,371
I've been thinking why you
haven't fixed the car yet.

820
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:26,872
What'd you come up with?

821
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:32,277
Well, if the car doesn't work,
Linda's gonna keep calling.

822
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:34,279
Keeps her in your life.

823
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:38,117
Once it's fixed,
less reason to call.

824
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,985
Ah.

825
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,090
Not going to Linda.
I'm selling it.

826
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:48,660
Yeah, packed her things,

827
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:51,296
closed up the house,
went to her sister's.

828
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:53,265
We both decided
it was for the best.

829
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:55,334
So, is this permanent?

830
00:40:56,937 --> 00:40:59,037
Don't you love
the sound of that?

831
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,473
Go for a ride?

832
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:03,175
You gonna let me drive?

833
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:05,744
Not a chance.
