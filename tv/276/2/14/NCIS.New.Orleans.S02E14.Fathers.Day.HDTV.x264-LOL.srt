That's right, my friends,
it's Mardi Gras, Fat Tuesday!

5
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:20,890
Time to cut it loose,

00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:21,925
get the Devil out ya!

7
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:23,993
I want to send
a big shout-out

8
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:27,030
to my man, our host
this evening, Mayor Hamilton.

9
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:28,898
Come on up here,
Mr. Mayor!

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,733
Hey!

11
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,702
Here he is--
John Cleary!

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,105
How you doing?

13
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:37,907
Yeah!

14
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:39,275
All right, well, you know,

15
00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:41,744
New York has New Year's Eve.

16
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:44,347
And Boston's St. Pat's

17
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:46,716
has its charms.

18
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:48,418
But no one,

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,320
no one

20
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:52,388
knows how to party

21
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,057
like we do.

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,391
Am I right?

23
00:00:55,393 --> 00:00:57,260
New Orleans!

24
00:00:57,262 --> 00:01:00,063
John Cleary!

25
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:02,699
Tom, you are a lucky man.

26
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,133
You're my chief of staff

27
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:06,469
and you're married to
this divine creature.

28

29
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:09,906
Oh, Mr. Mayor,
you are too kind.

30
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:12,041
Mm-hmm.
The city loves you, Doug.

31

Ah...

32
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:19,115

Hmm.

35
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,787
Well, like Oscar Wilde
always said:

36
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:27,924

Yes, ma'am.

41
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:37,867
Just make sure
he's back in an hour

42
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,002
to shake the parade king's hand.

opening up the Tru-tone.

00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:21,244
Oh, thanks, man.

59
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:23,346
Had to breathe some life

60
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:25,148
back into the place
for my mama.

61

Oh, she'd really be proud of you.
Thanks.

Hey, King, there's a guy
out back that needs you

63
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,420
to sign for a liquor delivery?

64
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:32,255
Thanks.

65
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:33,356
Excuse me?

Oh, he's gonna

He's supposed to bring

90
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,090
the King Cake from Randazzo's.

91
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:15,258
Called.

92
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,425
Late. Ah...

93
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:18,194
Finding that little baby

94
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:20,229
inside the King Cake, yet
another New Orleans tradition

95
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,898
that I love!
Right?

96
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,833
- It's so sweet.
- Only Mardi Gras

97
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:25,134
didn't start in New Orleans.

98
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:26,569
It started in Alabama.

99
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:27,603
Shut up.

100
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:29,172
Yeah the lore is Mobile had

101
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:31,808
the big parties and big floats
way before New Orleans.

102
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,809
"The lore"?

103
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:38,948
Dead Marine
and a wounded security guard

104
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,183
at Landon Court Hotel.

105
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:41,751
Mayor's Soirée is there tonight.

106
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:43,386
Well, my invitation must've

107
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:44,654
gotten lost in the mail.

108
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:45,888
Clearly.

109
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,190
Yeah, streets are packed.

110
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,658
Be easier to walk.

111
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,493
I'll get Pride and
meet you guys there.

112
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:55,364
Just like to go
on record as saying

113
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:57,633
this is not my kind of party.

114
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:03,906
Well, whoever you are,

115
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:06,175
all hell is coming in here.

116
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:07,877
The mayor...

117
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,378
...and a Fed?

118
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,447
That is,

119
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,349
that is some poor planning, son.

120
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:14,584
Poor planning.

121
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:16,519
I'm not sure about that.

122
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:18,855
Something like this
takes time.

123
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:21,290
Coordination.

124
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:26,863
Oh, the girl in
the red dress.

125
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:28,664
"Girl"?

126
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,667
She's your partner, wasn't she?

127
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,703
What's the matter-- these
digs too low-brow for her?

128
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:35,271
Is that it?

129
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:40,743
She's a... constituent.

130
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:44,247
Wanted a private meeting.

131
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:50,286
Is there some way
you'd like us to address you?

132
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:57,059
You got a name?

133
00:05:57,061 --> 00:05:58,861
What the hell, Dwayne?

134
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:01,797
Hey, Pride?

135
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,099
Pride?

136
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:08,004
- He put up a fight.
- Excuse me?

137
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:10,439
Right about where
your loafers are now.

138
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:11,774
The man who dropped this?

139
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:13,643
I busk for tips.

140
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:16,312
Mardi Gras
is my busiest night.

141
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:18,414
I was just taking a break

142
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,783
when I saw this guy in a mask

143
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:23,953
hit him with that,

144
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:27,757
and then shove him in a car.

145
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,959
You get a license plate?

146
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:45,141
See anyone near the body?
Any witnesses?

147
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:48,611
No, and the deceased
was working for hotel security.

148
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:50,713
Moonlighting for the
mayor's event, but he--

149
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,615
he's not one of ours.

150
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,417
- And you are?
- Kelly Grace.

151
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,018
Mayor's press secretary.

152
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,121
This is Tom Bujei, Chief of
Staff and Brad Curry is--

153
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:00,456
Brad Curry,
Mayor's Deputy Counsel.

154
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,924
I'm the one
who contacted the Feds.

155
00:07:01,926 --> 00:07:04,927
Hang on, Brad, okay,
we have bigger problems--

156
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:07,630
The problem is lying right
in there, Tom-- the dead Marine.

157
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:10,099
Okay, everyone
just take a step back.

158
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:13,602
Look, Mr. Curry, tell the
security to lock down the hotel.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:15,037
No one in or out.
Thank you.

160
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:18,174
Ms. Loretta?

161
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,810
Uh, it's military I.D.

162
00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:24,714
He's Corporal Jason Alex,
stationed at Bell Chase.

163
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:27,683
Cause of death?

164
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:31,120
Whatever was in this.

165
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:34,724
Might be the same thing
that drugged Officer Tate.

166
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,826
Officer Tate,

167
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:38,461
can you tell me
what happened?

168
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:43,065
I saw the woman in
the red dress run by.

169
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,167
I went back to find MONO.

170
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:47,536
And I felt a sharp
pain in my neck.

171
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:48,504
"MONO"?

172
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:50,172
Mayor of New Orleans.

173
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:58,280
That's his phone.
I recognize the ringtone.

174
00:07:58,282 --> 00:07:59,949
The mayor's phone?

175
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:00,916
Yes, it's his.

176
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:03,052
He's missing.
Hello?

177
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:04,820
We think he may have
been kidnapped.

178
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:05,988
Wait--

179
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,590
Brody, what?

180
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,726
What is it?

181
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:13,729
Pride's been taken, too.

182
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,300
What did we do?

183
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:19,435
Don't know.

184
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:21,971
Maybe nothing.

185
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,908
Well, either way...

186
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,010
a lot of folks love us, so...

187
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:31,113
they must've noticed
that we're gone.

188
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:33,115
What?

189
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:34,550
Mardi Gras?

190
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:36,886
Oh.
So...

191
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:40,222
I mean, what is
the camera for?

192
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:41,991
What is that?

193
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:45,661
Unless, I mean,

194
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:48,130
Do you think
it's-it's terrorism?

195
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:49,665
Is it terrorism?

196
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,367
- Mr. Mayor, you--
- It's terrorism, isn't it?

197
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:53,369
Hey!

198
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:57,873
Hey, so is that why you have
D-man out here with me, huh?

199
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,275
- Douglas...
- Two of us?

200
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,576
Are you a damn terrorist?

201
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:02,778
Are you
a damn terrorist?!

202
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,180
Calm down.

203
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,717
I got a lot of rich friends.
Lot of rich friends.

204
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,853
Just tell us what you want.

205
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:13,456
Sir?

206
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,226
Why are we here?

207
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,130
To confess.

208
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:43,696
All right, Patton,
what do we got?

209
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,364
Wait, just wait.

210
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:46,398
Okay, can't wait.

211
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,366
Pride's been kidnapped,

212
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:48,600
the mayor's been kidnapped.

213
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:50,302
Cats and dogs--
know what I mean?

214
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:51,370
Well, who's watching the bar?

215
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:53,038
A silver-painted man

216
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,641
and about a hundred
of Pride's closest friends.

217
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:56,942
Cats and dogs?

218
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:58,677
Okay.

219
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,879
The mayor and an NCIS agent

220
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:02,748
get kidnapped on Mardi Gras.

221
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,583
This is too much
of a coincidence.

222
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:07,419
Maybe someone trying
to send a message?

223
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:08,821
I dumped Pride's phone.

224
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:10,255
No threatening calls.

225
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:12,257
I checked with
FBI, Homeland.

226
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:15,194
No terror threats or chatter.

227
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:16,929
Someone they both know then?

228
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:20,165
Maybe-maybe a suspect
from a past case.

229
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,667
I'll pull old cases
and cross-reference them

230
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:22,868
with Hamilton.

231
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,870
All right,
my-my silver-painted friend

232
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:28,307
said he saw a gray Ford sedan,
license plate TSJ.

233
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,275
Track it, wide BOLO.

234
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,711
Roads, highways, airports.

235
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:34,179
Okay, I'm on it.

236
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:36,215
I called the FBI for support.

237
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:38,417
They're at least an hour out,
'cause of traffic.

238
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:40,052
Wait, if they can't get in,

239
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:42,121
then maybe our-our kidnapper
wasn't able to get out.

240
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:45,524
Cracking street cams.
Looking for this gray sedan.

241
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:46,759
It's gonna take some time.

242
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:47,993
Okay, we don't have time.

243
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,595
First hour of a kidnapping
is crucial.

244
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:51,196
It's when things
can go from bad to worse.

245
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:52,698
You don't think I know this?

246
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:54,900
We're gonna find him.

247
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:59,638
<i>Anyone claim responsibility?</i>

248
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,839
Any ransom demands?

249
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,741
The only calls
are from the press.

250
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:04,443
They want to talk to the mayor

251
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:05,744
before he shakes
the parade king's hand.

252
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:07,746
Which is less
than an hour away.

253
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:09,581
So it would be
great to resolve this

254
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,450
sooner than later.

255
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:14,286
Look, I'm sorry,
but it's a big deal.

256
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:16,355
Curry, you're deputy counsel?

257
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:19,258
Know of any claims
against the mayor?

258
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,659
Anyone who's angry?

259
00:11:20,661 --> 00:11:21,894
No, and what makes you think

260
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:23,062
this isn't about your guy?

261
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:25,264
Well, we can debate
character later.

262
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:28,467
All right, our best chance
is to find this girl.

263
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:31,136
Do any of you know her?
Talk to her?

264
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,504
God, no!

265
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:34,306
She knew just where
to take him.

266
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:35,607
No surveillance in that alcove.

267
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:38,577
There's a service entrance
nearby.

268
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,546
Ms. Loretta?

269
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:42,181
You still here?

270
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:43,348
It's Mardi Gras.

271
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,983
My police escort
needs a police escort

272
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:47,519
to help me get
Corporal Alex to the morgue.

273
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:49,021
But, while I wait,

274
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:51,557
you see this swelling
and rigidity around the eyes?

275
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,560
Could be a reaction to
the drug he was given.

276
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:56,028
We find out what kind of drug,

277
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,030
and we figure out
who had access to it.

278
00:11:58,032 --> 00:11:59,731
I'll get it to Sebastian,
get him started.

279
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,100
Thank you.
Keep me posted.

280
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:02,434
Got something!

281
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:06,271
I think this is MONO's girl.

282
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:07,372
See the chick in the coat?

283
00:12:07,374 --> 00:12:08,640
Red sequins,
that's her.

284
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:11,276
Good.
All right, we'll take the ballroom.

285
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:12,945
Your team has the floors.

286
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:14,813
I'll get this over to Patton,
see if can get an I.D.

287
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:16,115
Wait!

288
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:17,883
Best not to involve
too many people.

289
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:19,918
I mean, we don't want a citywide
panic on Mardi Gras.

290
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,820
Absolutely, we need to keep this
out of the glare of the media

291
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:23,622
until we know
what we're dealing with.

292
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:24,923
Hey, do us a favor.

293
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:26,592
Stop worrying about the PR.

294
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:29,595
And start worrying about
the mayor and Pride's lives.

295
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,836
Do you think this
is some sort of

296
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:40,906
weird ritual or something?

297
00:12:40,908 --> 00:12:44,309
It's Mardi Gras-- it's the night
before Ash Wednesday.

298
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,278
Everybody's got to atone.

299
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,713
Timing does seem right.

300
00:12:47,715 --> 00:12:49,515
Well, what are we supposed
to be confessing to?

301
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:51,283
I mean, who is this guy, anyway?

302
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:52,784
Is he some drug dealer
that you pissed off?

303
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:55,187
Is he a spy or something?

304
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:58,190
Not sure he's an NCIS interest.

305
00:12:58,192 --> 00:13:00,492
What is he doing back there?

306
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:03,262
Douglas? Douglas...

307
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:05,931
listen to me-- you need
to let me do the talking.

308
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,634
Oh, see, there you go
selling me short again, Dwayne.

309
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:10,302
People like talking to me.

310
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:11,970
They tell me a lot of things.

311
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:13,605
How do you think I became mayor?

312
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:17,309
The other candidate was flooding
your district with drugs.

313
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:20,913
Yeah, well, I don't feel like
talking about that right now.

314
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:21,980
Really?
Yeah--

315
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:23,482
Shut up!

316
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,652
Time to confess!

317
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:29,221
Be helpful if you could tell us
what we were guilty of.

318
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:31,190
What you<i> think</i> we're guilty of.

319
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:35,827
This is all a joke
to you, isn't it...

320
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:37,529
Mayor?

321
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:41,466
Douglas Hamilton,
divorced, two kids--

322
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:43,802
Max and Sam,
both at Ridgefield Prep.

323
00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:45,370
Agent Dwayne Pride.

324
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:46,805
Also divorced,

325
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:47,940
likes to sleep at work.

326
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:49,675
Daughter Laurel
is at college.

327
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:52,044
Main dorm, room 23.

328
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:53,245
What have you done with them?

329
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:54,346
Easy, Mayor.

330
00:13:54,348 --> 00:13:56,648
Your families are safe for now,

331
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,317
as long as I get what I want.

332
00:13:58,319 --> 00:13:59,451
No.

333
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:01,486
I want a guarantee.

334
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:04,256
And I'm not gonna say
a word until I get one!

335
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,327
♪ Now, some things come
and some things go ♪

336
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:10,562
♪ But there's one thing
that stays for sure... ♪

337
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:12,231
You think this is a militia?

338
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,966
Maybe Hamilton's
involved somehow?

339
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:15,434
Well, Patton
didn't find anything.

340
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,836
Has Pride been
telling you something?

341
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:19,271
Me? Of course not.

342
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:20,772
You know him better than I do.

343
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:23,508
Yeah, well,
he talks to you, too.

344
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,944
Look, Pride is gone.
I'm worried, okay?

345
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:28,680
Yeah, so am I.

346
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:30,449
On the inside.

347
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,094
Red sequins, 12:00.

348
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:50,235
Oh!
Oh!

349
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:03,649
Federal agents!
Stop!

350
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,819
Put the knife down!

351
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:09,988
Sure...

352
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:24,870
What the hell
are they clapping for?

353
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:27,239
I think the three of us.

354
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:29,574
We'll be here
every Tuesday night, hey!

355
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:31,877
Happy Mardi Gras!

356
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:38,884
You could leave now.

357
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,420
Free us.

358
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:43,522
We haven't even seen your face.

359
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:45,757
Don't know who you are.

360
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,026
You want to know who I am?

361
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:51,296
All right, fine.

362
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:02,641
Recognize me, Mayor?

363
00:16:03,977 --> 00:16:07,646
But you do,
don't you, Agent Pride?

364
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,120
Mike Spar.

365
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:16,688
Yeah.

366
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,191
I remember.

367
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:21,193
You two know each other?

368
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:24,996
We met when I was
with the sheriff's office.

369
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:26,698
25 years ago.

370
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,000
Got looped into a NOPD case.

371
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:31,269
Victim was from my parish.

372
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:33,372
Had to deliver
the death notification.

373
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:36,341
My... first time.

374
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,776
"Your wife killed herself."

375
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:40,045
That's what you said.

376
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:42,681
I never forgot
you standing there

377
00:16:42,683 --> 00:16:45,417
with that little girl
in your arms.

378
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,919
She's why we're here.

379
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:49,421
Your daughter?

380
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:55,394
Stacey grew up thinking
her mom abandoned her.

381
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:59,131
But we know
that's not the truth.

382
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,832
You and I

383
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:04,069
both know
that he murdered her.

384
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:26,977
This has got to be some mistake.

385
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,313
Agent Pride
may have been involved

386
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,515
in whatever you think happened.

387
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,250
But not me.

388
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,386
I was in law school
25 years ago!

389
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,323
Yes, and an alumni
of Sigma Eta Omicron Fraternity!

390
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,293
They had a Mardi Gras party
at the Alistair Hotel!

391
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,295
Party your wife attended
the night she died.

392
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,562
I remember.

393
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,797
Of course you do.

394
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,100
You were part of the cover-up.

395
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,136
That's you.

396
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,570
You were part of
the investigation.

397
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,938
You were there.

398
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,808
I was called to the scene
of a suicide.

399
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,177
Told a woman
with a history of depression

400
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,781
had used a frat party
as a means to end it all.

401
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,215
I...
"I accept

402
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,184
"or reject a hypothesis

403
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,053
based on evidence."

404
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,988
Scientist's creed.

405
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,756
Should be a cop's, too.

406
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,625
Witness statements
from five

407
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,227
of Hamilton's
fraternity brothers.

408
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,697
"Patricia acted crazy.

409
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,231
"Threatened she would
kill herself.

410
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,633
Was alone when she jumped."

411
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,201
Familiar names.

412
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,636
Yeah, they've
all been appointed

413
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,005
positions in Hamilton's
administration!

414
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,673
You think I killed your wife,

415
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,676
because I did a couple
of frat buddies some favors?

416
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,212
You were on the guest list!

417
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,882
But the cops
never interviewed you!

418
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,919
<i>He</i> never interviewed you.

419
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,588
Because I wasn't there!

420
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,657
And I'm sorry to say this,

421
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,393
but it sounds like
your wife had some issues.

422
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,894
No, that is not true.
Doug...

423
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,262
- Doug, take it easy!
- No, I'm saying--

424
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,897
Look, it's the type of thing

425
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,399
that would force people
to make a bad decision!

426
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,134
I stayed at home
with a baby,

427
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,635
so she could go out
with friends,

428
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,870
do some networking.

429
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,138
It was Mardi Gras.

430
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,606
I said, "Go, have some fun."

431
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,074
You know?

432
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,580
And then you showed up
at my door.

433
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,656
What are you thinking, Mike?

434
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:26,029
I'm tired of playing games.

435
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,835
I know my rights.

436
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,303
I'm not saying anything.

437
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,472
Angela Goodwin.

438
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,074
Priors include possession

439
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,375
and solicitation.

440
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,977
You're stepping it up
to conspiracy,

441
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,412
kidnapping, assault

442
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,013
with a deadly weapon,

443
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,314
murder?

444
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,285
He said it was a joke.

445
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,520
Who?

446
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,888
The guy who paid me
$500 to flirt

447
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,456
with the mayor
and get him alone.

448
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,725
Getting the mayor alone.

449
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,461
That didn't
strike you as strange?

450
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,196
I've spent time with politicians
and their friends.

451
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,798
They do strange things.

452
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,333
Look, the guy said

453
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,968
he was a fraternity brother
playing a prank.

454
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,272
No one was supposed
to get hurt, I swear.

455
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,540
Did he tell you his name?

456
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,941
No.

457
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,709
What'd he look like?

458
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,244
Long, graying hair.

459
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,879
Sad, but nice.

460
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,015
He also had
a beard.

461
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,450
I am telling you
the truth.

462
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,084
I like the mayor.

463
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,853
I voted for him.

464
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,991
What's the plan here, Mike?

465
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,029
You've got
that gun...

466
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,497
and what?

467
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,934
Murder two people?

468
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,502
You're not this man, Mike.

469
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,370
You think you know me?

470
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,439
Know you're angry.

471
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,041
Your daughter's hurtin'.

472
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,242
Both desperate

473
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,577
for answers.

474
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,911
Been that way for too long.

475
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,112
Sorry.

476
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,582
That's not gonna change.

477
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,250
Pride never talked to me

478
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,219
because I was never
at that party.

479
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,097
You sure about that, Douglas?

480
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,134
That's you.

481
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,439
Where did you get this?

482
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,975
Law school archives.

483
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,943
Took a couple years
of digging,

484
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,513
but it was there.

485
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,448
You lied.

486
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,316
With everything
that's at stake.

487
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,653
That was damn reckless.

488
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,725
Ran Angela's description
of the kidnapper

489
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,127
through the hotel employee
records. No luck.

490
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,695
Anything on the party guests?

491
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,564
Hotel security is still
reviewing surveillance.

492
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,267
Look, Angela mentioned
a fraternity prank.

493
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:46,036
Is there any chance whoever took
the mayor is pulling one?

494
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,405
There were a lot of pranks in
my frat days, some crazy stuff,

495
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,340
but I doubt anyone would do
something like this.

496
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,546
Pentobarbital.
Sebastian?

497
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,848
Hey, yeah, I got to the lab
as soon as I could.

498
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,950
I'm designated driver
for my new Krewe.

499
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:03,153
It's a Krewe Livre.

500
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,555
That's French for book.

501
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,923
They're-they're my book club.

502
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,725
I'm Mark Twain, obviously.
This is, uh,

503
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,128
Flannery O'Connor, William
Faulkner, Truman Capote...

504
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,462
Pentobarbital?

505
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,131
Yeah, pentobarbital.

506
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,699
I think it's the drug
that killed Corporal Alex.

507
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,234
I determined it
based on the photos

508
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,036
that Loretta sent me
of Alex's eyes.

509
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,637
The swelling and muscle rigidity

510
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:21,972
were caused by
an allergic reaction...

511
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,775
- malignant hyperthermia.
- More, please.

512
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,443
It's, uh, it's also
an anesthetic

513
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,579
used in the cocktail
for lethal injections.

514
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,814
And, uh...

515
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,150
I'm officially scared right now.

516
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,686
I mean,
Pride's like a dad to me.

517
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,788
Even if he doesn't realize it.

518
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,790
Maybe he does realize it
and he's just doing

519
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,425
a reverse parenting thing,
like Atticus Finch before...

520
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,759
Sebastian.

521
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,094
Yeah, um... sorry.

522
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,630
The drug is made
at compounding pharmacies.

523
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,899
So our kidnapper
could be working at one.

524
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,934
Well, the twist is that
there are secrecy laws

525
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,236
that shield
lethal injection suppliers.

526
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,972
Employee records
are kept under wraps.

527
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:57,407
Well, then, we'll have
to unwrap them.

528
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,810
All right,
five pharmacies

529
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,845
in the Gulf region
provide pentobarbital.

530
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,847
We need to check employee names
of every one of them

531
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,649
and see if an of them
connect with Pride or Hamilton.

532
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,084
What in the hell

533
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,819
would a pharmacist want
with Pride anyway?

534
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,320
No idea.

535
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,722
Could be a developing interest

536
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,290
he never had a chance
to tell us about.

537
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,625
Seeing 75 employees

538
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,326
who had clearance
to handle the drug.

539
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,496
Cross-referencing
NCIS cases, the mayor...

540
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,164
All right, what about
that gray sedan?

541
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,166
Partial license TSJ.

542
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,002
- Checking DMV records.
- Good.

543
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,536
Because if one of them
drives it,

544
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,172
we're one step closer
to finding Pride.

545
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,108
Why did I even think
to trust you?

546
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,876
It must be photoshopped.

547
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,544
It's not what you think.

548
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,013
Pick one, Douglas.

549
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,614
He means stop lying!

550
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,884
Stop... lying!

551
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,753
Mike...
Confess!

552
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,488
No! Mike, wait!

553
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,289
Mike!

554
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,524
Mike, take it easy.

555
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,559
You can take this
to the D.A.

556
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,094
No, the D.A. rejected a request

557
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,296
to reopen the case
two weeks ago.

558
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,998
Get up! Get up!

559
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,166
Say it!
Mike...

560
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,901
You killed her! Say it!
Mike!

561
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,369
Mike, this won't help Stacey.

562
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,071
Don't do this.
Don't.

563
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,472
The mayor's gonna confess.

564
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,241
Confess!

565
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,910
All right.

566
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,378
I was there.

567
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,126
Of the pharmacists
who had access

568
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:34,128
to the drug
that killed Corporal Alex,

569
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,697
only one had a connection
to Pride or Hamilton.

570
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:38,032
Mike Spar.

571
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:40,034
Spar studied medicine
and chemistry

572
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:41,669
at Hamilton's Alma mater.

573
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:43,404
And he owns a gray Taurus,

574
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:45,205
the one Pride was seen
taken away in.

575
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:47,141
Uses his own car...

576
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:49,109
Doesn't sound like
a criminal mastermind to me.

577
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:52,012
Uses a drug associated
with lethal injection.

578
00:24:52,014 --> 00:24:54,048
Sounds pretty James Bond to me.

579
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,916
Okay, so he went
to Hamilton's school.

580
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:57,985
What's the connection to Pride?

581
00:24:57,987 --> 00:25:02,189
Running Spar's name
against Pride's NCIS cases...

582
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:03,624
Nothing.

583
00:25:03,626 --> 00:25:05,859
All right, let's go back
farther than that.

584
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:08,395
Pride's old cases when he was
working sheriff's deputy.

585
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:11,999
Got 'em, right here.

586
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:13,968
Mike Spar.
His wife committed...

587
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,337
suicide at a Mardi Gras party.

588
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:20,174
Pride's JPSO report states
that he notified Spar.

589
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:21,775
All right,
that's the connection.

590
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:23,143
Spar's employee record

591
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:25,045
lists his daughter
as an emergency contact.

592
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:26,380
Trying to track her down.

593
00:25:26,382 --> 00:25:27,681
Spar has a place on Dauphine.

594
00:25:27,683 --> 00:25:29,183
His daughter could be there.

595
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,951
If Pride and Hamilton
are still in the Quarter,

596
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:32,853
it could be where
Mike Spar took them.

597
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:35,055
We're closer.
I'll have SWAT meet me there.

598
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:38,559
You either lied
because you killed her

599
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:40,761
or you're
protecting someone.

600
00:25:40,763 --> 00:25:42,429
Oh, y-you're judge and jury now?

601
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:43,664
Just a cop.

602
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:45,232
Doing what the cops
should have done

603
00:25:45,234 --> 00:25:46,900
a long time ago.

604
00:25:47,737 --> 00:25:50,204
So, Mardi Gras night,

605
00:25:50,206 --> 00:25:51,572
25 years ago...

606
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:52,773
Help!

607
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:54,408
Somebody help me!

608
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,877
Help me!

609
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,279
No one can hear you.

610
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,181
Mardi Gras night.

611
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:03,250
Tell me what happened.

612
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:09,289
All right.

613
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:13,127
I was there that night.

614
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:16,697
But I did not see

615
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:19,099
what happened to his wife.

616
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:21,101
I left early, I swear.

617
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:22,136
Why'd you lie?

618
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:25,272
A party like that?

619
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:26,940
Where a girl dies?

620
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:29,209
Not good, if you've got
any political ambition.

621
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:30,844
More.

622
00:26:30,846 --> 00:26:32,479
You're hiding something.

623
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:34,448
I know you were at that party.

624
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,116
I know you lied.

625
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:38,352
We get out of here,

626
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:40,821
I'll figure out why.

627
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:51,799
There was...

628
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:54,301
a ritual, of sorts.

629
00:26:54,303 --> 00:26:56,470
Behind closed doors.

630
00:26:56,472 --> 00:26:58,238
You've heard
the stories.

631
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,675
And if anybody
knew I was there...

632
00:27:01,677 --> 00:27:04,745
I mean, I would
be destroyed.

633
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:06,547
You lied for 25 years

634
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:08,515
because you were part of
a sick fraternity ritual?

635
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:09,917
More like

636
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,687
you were obsessed
for 25 years, Mr. Spar.

637
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:15,856
Not me.

638
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:17,324
I had to put this away.

639
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:19,326
Entering Spar's house. Stand by.

640
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:20,994
<i>Focus on my daughter.</i>

641
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:25,299
<i>But...</i>

642
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:28,135
Stacey...

643
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:30,637
she was the one
who couldn't move on.

644
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,375
<i>She had to know the truth.</i>

645
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:38,178
<i>I told her her mother</i>
<i>died in an accident.</i>

646
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:42,082
She heard rumors and...

647
00:27:43,853 --> 00:27:45,953
I told her to ignore them.

648
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,554
Let it go.

649
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:49,590
She was the one who-who...

650
00:27:49,592 --> 00:27:51,325
spearheaded all of this?

651
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:52,926
Yes.

652
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,865
<i>What she saw...</i>

653
00:27:57,867 --> 00:28:00,134
<i>it was too much for her.</i>

654
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:03,537
<i>She started numbing herself,</i>

655
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,506
<i>drinking too much,</i>

656
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:07,174
<i>getting into drugs.</i>

657
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:11,378
I had to help her.

658
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,848
She took it on, didn't she?

659
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,350
Had to.

660
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:17,951
Yeah.

661
00:28:19,922 --> 00:28:23,090
When you're abandoned,
there's a need to know.

662
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:27,761
Now we're going
to work this case.

663
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,565
We're gonna work this
for Stacey.

664
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:35,435
Mike, what you found
in those files...

665
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:36,970
the evidence.

666
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:38,806
Patricia's injuries--

667
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:40,707
any signs of a struggle?

668
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:43,277
Cops, uh, didn't focus on
any of that stuff.

669
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,079
But we are.

670
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:47,614
Now, come on.

671
00:28:47,616 --> 00:28:50,317
Prove the hypothesis.

672
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,219
While I start the autopsy
on Corporal Alex,

673
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:54,822
- I want you to take a look at these.
- Okay, what are they?

674
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:56,757
Well, they're photos
Brody found

675
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,392
in Mike Spar's house.

676
00:28:58,394 --> 00:29:01,228
It appears Spar and his daughter

677
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,730
were investigating
his wife's suicide.

678
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:05,265
Huh.

679
00:29:07,403 --> 00:29:08,836
There.

680
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:11,041
Cuts, broken neck--
that speaks to the fall.

681
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:11,536
Huh.

682
00:29:11,537 --> 00:29:14,408
This spiral
fracture doesn't.

683
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,410
Spiral fractures usually
don't happen in falls.

684
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:19,913
More like...
industrial accidents.

685
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:23,250
Or when someone... twists
someone else's arm in a fight.

686
00:29:24,587 --> 00:29:26,353
Maybe Patricia
struggled with someone

687
00:29:26,355 --> 00:29:28,288
before she went
over the balcony.

688
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,157
Or she was pushed.

689
00:29:30,993 --> 00:29:32,960
You think she was murdered?

690
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:38,265
Douglas...

691
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:40,133
tell the truth.

692
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:45,606
Well, it'd be a whole lot easier
if he got rid of that thing.

693
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:02,556
When I left the party,

694
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,759
I might've remembered

695
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:08,929
seeing some guys
with his wife.

696
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:10,564
Part of the ritual?

697
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:14,968
Get her alone,
get her drunk.

698
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,703
She fights them off.

699
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:18,839
I told you I left early.

700
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:20,140
Wait.

701
00:30:20,142 --> 00:30:22,809
The...

702
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:24,745
necklace.

703
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:28,482
When you saw her,
was she wearing a necklace?

704
00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:31,151
A pendant...

705
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:32,886
in the shape of a rose.

706
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:33,887
I don't remember.

707
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:34,855
It-it's not mentioned

708
00:30:34,857 --> 00:30:35,889
in the police report.

709
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:37,324
She was wearing one that night?

710
00:30:37,326 --> 00:30:38,358
I bought it for her

711
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,459
the night our Stacey was born.

712
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:40,661
She never
took it off.

713
00:30:40,663 --> 00:30:42,029
Oh, wait, hold it.

714
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:44,331
One second.

715
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,966
All right, that necklace.

716
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:48,969
The rose, what...
did it have a sapphire?

717
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:51,338
Yes.

718
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:54,074
Did you take it?

719
00:30:54,076 --> 00:30:55,642
No!

720
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:58,245
But I think I know who did.

721
00:30:59,882 --> 00:31:01,515
Oh, my God!

722
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:03,650
This newspaper photo
of the investigation.

723
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:04,952
Well, you're not
gonna get much

724
00:31:04,954 --> 00:31:06,453
out of that body
with the sheet on it.

725
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:08,355
No, it's not the body.
It's this.

726
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:11,124
This is a logo
on the carpet near the body

727
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:13,360
of the old Alistair Hotel.

728
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:14,928
The Alistair--
I never heard of it.

729
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,797
Yeah, 'cause it closed
years and years ago.

730
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,000
The owners gutted it,
but left some of it intact.

731
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:21,535
What did they build
in its place?

732
00:31:21,537 --> 00:31:25,272
The Landon Court Hotel
on top of and around it.

733
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:27,741
That's-that's
where the mayor's party is.

734
00:31:27,743 --> 00:31:29,409
And no one can figure out

735
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:31,912
how Spar got the mayor
out of there.

736
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,148
What if they never left?

737
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,917
He-he-he somehow
restrains the mayor,

738
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:38,218
goes and gets Pride,

739
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,853
then returns
to the scene of the crime.

740
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:41,688
Where his wife died
25 years ago.

741
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,123
Sebastian...

742
00:31:43,892 --> 00:31:45,359
I think Hamilton and Pride

743
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,128
are still somewhere
in that hotel.

744
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:50,831
I... I didn't
make the connection

745
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,567
till he said the thing
about the necklace.

746
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:57,471
A couple years ago, I was
playing poker with some guys.

747
00:31:57,473 --> 00:31:58,939
Fraternity brothers?

748
00:32:00,576 --> 00:32:03,877
And one of them
talked about a necklace.

749
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:05,412
Called it his trophy.

750
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:07,614
Said it represented
what you can get away with

751
00:32:07,616 --> 00:32:09,416
if you know the right people.

752
00:32:09,418 --> 00:32:11,084
You know where the necklace is?

753
00:32:11,086 --> 00:32:13,120
Uh-huh.

754
00:32:13,122 --> 00:32:15,756
Who has it?

755
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,692
Who killed my wife?

756
00:32:21,463 --> 00:32:23,330
Not until you let us go.

757
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,966
Douglas!

758
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:27,300
Not a negotiation!

759
00:32:27,302 --> 00:32:29,503
Who has it?!

760
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:31,338
Tell me!

761
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:35,709
Or Agent Pride dies.

762
00:32:55,284 --> 00:32:58,218
This map is
of the old Alistair Hotel.

763
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,854
A... a hotel within a hotel?

764
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:03,557
This is the medical
examiner's theory?

765
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,292
You got a better one?

766
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:07,794
All right, Spar
pays the girl.

767
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:09,229
And she lures Hamilton.

768
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:11,197
And then Spar attacks him

769
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,966
and pulls him
into this service entrance.

770
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:14,534
All right,
so the storage closet where

771
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:15,969
Corporal Alex's body
was found, it looks like

772
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:18,071
there's some kind
of tunnel behind it.

773
00:33:18,073 --> 00:33:20,907
But that doesn't explain
how Spar got to Agent Pride.

774
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:22,609
This might--
Patton finally got a hit

775
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:24,411
on the gray sedan
seen leaving the bar.

776
00:33:24,413 --> 00:33:26,980
It's parked on Madison Street.

777
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:28,615
Well, there's
an old service entrance there.

778
00:33:28,617 --> 00:33:29,649
Yep.

779
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:31,318
Spar restrains Hamilton,

780
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,653
leaves through the service
entrance to get Pride,

781
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:35,455
brings him back,
chaos of Mardi Gras,

782
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:36,923
no one's the wiser.

783
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:38,491
It was kind of the perfect plan.

784
00:33:38,493 --> 00:33:40,493
To what--
taking Pride and the mayor

785
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:41,962
back to the scene
of his wife's suicide?

786
00:33:41,964 --> 00:33:43,229
Guy's a psychopath.

787
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:44,598
Okay, we got to do this right.

788
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,232
Is there anybody
this guys trusts? Family?

789
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,335
Anyone we can get to talk to
him, if he makes contact?

790
00:33:48,337 --> 00:33:50,637
He's got a daughter and we are
trying to get in touch with her.

791
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:52,672
You need me.

792
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:54,908
And I'm not doing anything
without him.

793
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,509
Tell me.

794
00:33:57,479 --> 00:34:00,013
Listen, Mike...

795
00:34:00,015 --> 00:34:02,582
God knows I'm no authority
on parenting.

796
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,284
But I could learn
a thing or two from you.

797
00:34:04,286 --> 00:34:06,186
Yeah.

798
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:08,254
Like putting my kid's welfare
before mine.

799
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,824
Just like you did with Stacey.

800
00:34:10,826 --> 00:34:12,292
Stop.

801
00:34:12,294 --> 00:34:14,027
She's the reason
why we're here now.

802
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:16,896
And she's the reason
why you need to let us go.

803
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:18,932
Stop.

804
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,469
Don't you want
to see Stacey again?

805
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:24,638
Never gonna see her again.

806
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:28,375
Why not?

807
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:32,178
She's dead, isn't she?

808
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,050
<i>Bad news.</i>

809
00:34:37,052 --> 00:34:39,452
Spar's daughter
died of a drug overdose.

810
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:40,520
When?

811
00:34:40,522 --> 00:34:41,688
Two weeks ago.

812
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,056
All right, thanks.

813
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,158
Daughter's dead.
Drug overdose.

814
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,060
So no family
to talk Spar down?

815
00:34:47,062 --> 00:34:48,294
Nope, it's up to us.

816
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:49,696
All right, Percy and I
will take the tunnel.

817
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:52,032
Tate, you got the
service entrance.

818
00:34:52,034 --> 00:34:54,234
Copy.

819
00:34:59,775 --> 00:35:02,075
He was never gonna let us go.

820
00:35:02,077 --> 00:35:04,678
Change the plan.

821
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,614
It's been a suicide mission
from the start.

822
00:35:07,616 --> 00:35:09,315
Change it, Douglas.

823
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,483
How?

824
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,552
Who has the necklace?

825
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:16,356
Who killed Patricia?

826
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:18,391
A name-- give him...

827
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:19,859
give him a name.

828
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:22,796
Political suicide, Dwayne.

829
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:24,297
An actual suicide.

830
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:26,833
And I am not saying
a word with that thing on.

831
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,768
You selfish son of a bitch!

832
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,203
I'll figure it out,
Douglas.

833
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:32,739
We get out of here...
you know I will.

834
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:34,374
You know I will!

835
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:39,245
Agent Lasalle,
I'm closing the gap.

836
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:41,681
This is it.

837
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:42,949
Down there.

838
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:44,284
Let's roll.

839
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:54,627
Let me see the picture.

840
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:11,377
Fourth guy from the left.

841
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,613
- Tate?
- In position.

842
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,887
All she wanted.

843
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:25,592
Needed, really.

844
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:28,828
You think she knows we got him?

845
00:36:29,698 --> 00:36:31,931
Yes.

846
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:34,300
I believe she does.

847
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,137
They both do.

848
00:36:57,692 --> 00:37:00,894
Dwayne, cut me loose.

849
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:03,096
NCIS!

850
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:04,998
- Get your hands up!
- No, no, no, we're clear!

851
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,866
Gun!
No!

852
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:09,602
Pride!

853
00:37:10,906 --> 00:37:13,306
Pride!
Pride, are you hurt?

854
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,276
You hit?

855
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:18,945
Talk to me!

856
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,280
Look, can you sit up?

857
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:39,799
It was a camera,
not a gun.

858
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:43,670
He was just trying
to be a good dad.

859
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:52,579
Mayor...

860
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:54,781
You're sure you're okay
to continue with the night?

861
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:56,649
Don't I look okay, Tom?

862
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,518
You look great!

863
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,853
Handsome.

864
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:01,387
- Refreshed, even.
- Thank you, Kelly.

865
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:02,488
If I may so, sir.

866
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,023
Thank you.
Sir, the parade king

867
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:05,425
three minutes--
gotta shake his hand.

868
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:06,492
Yeah, yeah, uh, just one sec.
One second.

869
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:08,194
Be right back.

870
00:38:08,196 --> 00:38:09,863
Hey, Dwayne?

871
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,699
Well, I thought you'd be off

872
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:14,500
celebrating your grand opening.

873
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:17,103
You let it get
awfully close there, Douglas.

874
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:19,706
I saved your life, nonetheless.

875
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,208
You could say that.

876
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,811
Where's the video?

877
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:26,145
It's safe.

878
00:38:26,147 --> 00:38:27,313
Mm.

879
00:38:27,315 --> 00:38:30,083
Well, I want it destroyed,
Dwayne.

880
00:38:31,753 --> 00:38:35,188
Happy Mardi Gras, Mr. Mayor.

881
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,357
You, too.

882
00:38:42,464 --> 00:38:44,097
Ms. Bujei?

883
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,865
That is a very pretty necklace.

884
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:48,301
Is it a gift from
your husband?

885
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:49,802
Why do I get
the feeling you already

886
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:51,237
know the answer
to that question?

887
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:53,006
Tom, what is going on here?

888
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:55,308
These officers want
to ask him some questions

889
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,111
about the murder
of Patricia Spar.

890
00:39:02,784 --> 00:39:07,320
♪ Moving up higher
and higher and I know ♪

891
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,425
♪ That God is watching us... ♪

892
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:19,132
Hey, everybody,
look who we found!

893
00:39:19,134 --> 00:39:20,233
Dad!

894
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:21,968
Well...

895
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,304
uh, he was

896
00:39:24,306 --> 00:39:26,406
a little worried about you.

897
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:29,375
As was I.

898
00:39:29,377 --> 00:39:30,910
Thanks for finding me, boo.

899
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:32,445
Hey, Patton!

900
00:39:32,447 --> 00:39:35,248
My man, my man!

901
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,582
Yeah, hey...

902
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,718
we have been
saving this for you, man.

903
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,820
"We"?<i> I.</i>

904
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:43,256
He couldn't keep
his hands off this thing.

905
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:44,824
Triple teaming.

906
00:39:44,826 --> 00:39:46,326
Come on, man.

907
00:39:46,328 --> 00:39:47,727
Is that right?

908
00:39:47,729 --> 00:39:49,262
Whoever gets the baby

909
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:51,497
has health and prosperity

910
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:52,966
for the next year.

911
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:56,135
All right, well,
it sounds good to me.

912
00:39:56,137 --> 00:39:58,638
I'm in.
