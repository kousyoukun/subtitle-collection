1
00:00:13,493 --> 00:00:15,393
Kermit那么尽力的演出
Kermit's been playing his heart out,

2
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:17,193
你却一直在埋头看你的手机

3
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:19,561
我又不用眼睛来听音乐

我们有过约定 记得吗

这可不仅仅是个游戏

9
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:29,337

Not if you keep playing, you're not.

10
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:35,076
你对我颐指气使的态度竟让我性奋起来 你说奇不奇怪
Is it strange that your bossing me around turns me on?

11
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:38,479
任何事都可以让你们男的性奋起来

我把每种解码方法都试过了
I've tried every likely decryption variant.

39

我们没有出门的密码
Well, we can't key our way out.

49
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,567
那就只能强攻了

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,124
是啊 怎么了
Yes, why?

150
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,860
Reid上尉昨晚给他打了三次电话
Lieutenant Reid called him three times last night.

151
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:43,711
12个小时 不过才
... 12 hours, but it's only...

152
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:44,634
12个小时吗
12 hours?

153
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,002
嗨 Evette 最近好吗
Hi, Evette, how you doing?

154
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:48,771
呃 我要点的和平常一样
Uh, I just want the usual, please.

155
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:51,472
一个煎蛋卷 带瑞士奶酪 菠菜 番茄的
Egg white omelet with Swiss, spinach, tomato.

156
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:54,175
呃 请确定他的蛋卷里没有蛋黄
Uh, and please make sure there are no yolks in his eggs.

157
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:55,777
我儿子对它过敏
My son has an allergy.

158
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:57,611
他会得荨麻疹的
He breaks out in hives.

159
00:05:57,613 --> 00:05:58,780
好吧 但那只发生过一次
Okay, Th-Th-that happened once

160
00:05:58,782 --> 00:05:59,981
还是在中学的时候
and it was in middle school.

161
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:01,683
但是那时你全身长满了荨麻疹
Yeah, but the hives were everywhere.

162
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,551
我指的是无处不长
And I mean everywhere. You were in

163
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:04,752
你当时非常不舒服
so much discomfort.

164
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:06,120
甚至连衣服都穿不了
No, you couldn't even put clothes on.

165
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:08,421
只能裸着身子 躺在客厅沙发上
Just lay there naked on the living room couch.

166
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:10,023
还记得吗
You remember that?

167
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:11,457
-我现在还记得 -我只是想说
- I do now. - I'm just saying

168
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,693
有备无患
better safe than sorry.

169
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:14,061
是吗 呃
Hm? Uh...

170
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:16,663
我就要燕麦粥
I'll just have the oatmeal, please.

171
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,665
非常感谢 谢谢
Thanks so much. Thanks a lot.

172
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:22,468
她会是个漂亮的女孩
You know, she'd be a pretty girl

173
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,536
如果她脸上没有那些乱七八糟的东西的话
if she didn't have all that gunk on her face.

174
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:26,105
我喜欢她脸上的装饰
I like the gunk on her face.

175
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:28,107
我还想约她出去 趁你
Sort of thinking of asking her out before you gave her

176
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:29,508
-还没告诉她我的全部病史之前 -别闹了
- my whole medical history. - Oh, don't be ridiculous.

177
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,710
她不是你喜欢的类型
She's not your type.

178
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:31,877
是啊
Yeah,

179
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,713
她可能全身都是纹身
she's probably got a full body tattoo.

180
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:35,380
是啊 很有可能
Yeah... probably.

181
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:38,417
抱歉 妈妈
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.

182
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,004
是工作上的电话 我得去接一下
This is work. I got to take it.

183
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:41,420
噢 好吧
Oh, well.

184
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,989
Pride 记得提醒我我再也不能去Surrey's吃饭了
Pride, remind me I can never show my face at Surrey's again.

185
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,591
这我们稍后再谈
Let's talk about that later.

186
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:48,593
你认识Micheal Reid上尉吗
Do you know Lieutenant Michael Reid?

187
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:50,461
认识 他是我的一个朋友 怎么了
Uh, yeah, he's a, he's a friend of mine. Why?

188
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:52,496
他昨晚给你打了三个电话是吗
He called you three times last night?

189
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:54,465
-你怎么知道 -先生 求你了
- How do you know that? - Sir, please!

190
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:56,067
我需要你帮忙 我丈夫
I need your help! My husband,

191
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:58,435
他遭到了袭击 我想他伤得很重
he was attacked! I think he's hurt bad.

192
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:00,070
-你能过来吗 -噢 天哪 好的 当然可以
- Can you please come? - Oh, my God, yeah, sure!

193
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:01,705
-Pride 我待会儿再打给你 -Sebastian
- Pride, I-I got to call you back! - Sebastian!

194
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:03,073
不要跟那女人走
Do not go with that woman!

195
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:06,744
Sebastian
Sebastian!

196
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:07,978
好了 没事 呃 别担心
Okay, all right, uh, uh, don't worry, I'm gonna...

197
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,080
我打电话叫救护车 好吗
I'm gonna call an ambulance, all right?

198
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:11,181
啊
Aah!

199
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:38,042
Laud太太
Ms. Lund?

200
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:40,144
Laud太太 我们是
Ms. Lund, NCIS Special Agents

201
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:41,879
NCIS特别探员Pride和Lasalle 我们正在找你的儿子
Pride and Lasalle. We're looking for your son.

202
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:44,581
我就知道 我就知道事情有点不对劲儿
I knew it. I knew something was wrong.

203
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,115
我前夫会告诉你们
My ex will tell you

204
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:47,351
我总是觉得事情有什么不对
that I always think something's wrong.

205
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:48,852
也许他是对的
And m-maybe that's true.

206
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:50,987
别人都知道我经常反应过度
You know, I have been known to overreact. I...

207
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:52,789
我有焦虑症 在接受药物治疗
I have anxiety. I was on medication,

208
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,290
但那些药让我昏昏欲睡
but then I... It was making me drowsy,

209
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,859
所以我决定
so I decided that I should

210
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:57,026
-停止吃药 -能让我们单独谈谈吗
- just stop taking... - Could you give us a moment?

211
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:57,994
当然
Absolutely.

212
00:07:57,996 --> 00:08:00,029
哦 天啊
Oh... geez.

213
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:02,197
好吧 我所担心的一切
Okay, everything that I have ever worried about

214
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,999
现在都发生了
is all happening now.

215
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:06,435
没事的 Lund太太 深呼吸 发生什么了
It's okay Ms. Lund. Just take a breath. What happened?

216
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:09,372
我告诉了那些警察 我们当时在吃早餐
I told the officer we were having breakfast.

217
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:12,708
Sebastian接了个电话 接着他就失踪了
Sebastian took the call and then... he was gone.

218
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,561
呃 他在外面的时候 是不是这个女人与他接触来着
Uh, when he was outside, was he approached by this woman?

219
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:15,211
我 我不知道
I-I don't know,

220
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:18,246
我什么都没看见 我儿子怎么了
I didn't see anything. What happened to my son?

221
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,014
我们还不清楚他是否出事了
We don't know if anything's happened to him.

222
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:22,884
我很感激你顾及我的感受而这么说
I-I appreciate you saying that for my benefit.

223
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:25,119
但是如果没出事 你也不会在这里
But you wouldn't be here if there wasn't a problem.

224
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,722
我明白Sebastian的聪明是从哪儿遗传的了
I see where Sebastian got his intelligence from.

225
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:30,425
但他也同样遗传了容易受伤的特点
And also a penchant for bruising.

226
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,026
就像他母亲一样
Like his mother.

227
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,095
-你一定要找到他 -他是我的人
- You have to find him. - He's one of my people,

228
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,997
我队伍里的一员 Lund太太 我们会找到他的 我保证
one of my team, Mrs. Lund. We'll find him, I promise.

229
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:37,575
好的
All right.

230
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,166
Clark警官会载你回去
Officer Clark's gonna give you a ride.

231
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,334
我们一有发现 就会通知你
Soon as we find out more, we'll let you know.

232
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,537
谢谢
Thank you.

233
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,576
多位目击者说他们看到一个情绪激动的女人
Witnesses say they saw an agitated woman

234
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:50,944
走向Sebastian
approach Sebastian.

235
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,077
与Reid上尉遇到的情形非常相似
Just like Lieutenant Reid.

236
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,112
对 她带着他
Yeah. She led him off

237
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:54,246
朝这个方向走去
in this direction.

238
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:56,181
让目击者做画像素描
Get the witnesses the sketches.

239
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,717
-好的 -好的
- All right. - All right?

240
00:08:57,719 --> 00:09:00,787
再调出这片地方的监控录像
And then pull surveillance footage in the area.

241
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:02,422
马上办
I'm on it.

242
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:04,590
我会让Gregoria过来帮忙
I'll get Gregorio to lend a hand, too.

243
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:07,927
快接啊 Sebastian
Come on, Sebastian.

244
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:09,294
我觉得他不会接
I don't think he's gonna answer.

245
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:14,265
等等
Wait a minute.

246
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,301
你听到了吗
You hear that?

247
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:22,674
Sebastian的手机
Sebastian's phone.

248
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,346
上面有血迹
There's blood on it.

249
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:31,882
这里究竟发生了什么
What the hell is happening here?

250
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,884
Sebastian被绑架了吗
Sebastian been kidnapped?

251
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:35,753
那我们现在在这干嘛 得出去找他
Well, what are we doing? Come, we got to hit the streets.

252
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,020
-走吧 -不 等等 等一下
- Let's go. - No, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

253
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:38,355
我们不知道去哪儿找他
We don't know where to go.

254
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:40,858
-我们不能干坐在这儿 -嘿
- We can't just sit here. - Hey...

255
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,125
-我们会找到他的 -嘿
- we're gonna find him. - Hey.

256
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:45,495
新奥尔良警局追查到了
NOPD tracked down the van

257
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:47,797
绑走Reid上尉和Sebastian的那辆小货车
used to grab Lt. Reid and Sebastian.

258
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,899
-那是个好消息 -别太兴奋
- That's good news. - Don't get too excited.

259
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:52,368
嫌犯弃车逃跑了 还烧了那辆车
The suspects dumped and burned it.

260
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,136
没有证据留下
No evidence.

261
00:09:55,273 --> 00:09:57,273
所以我们要回到最初的案件
So we start at the beginning.

262
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,275
绑匪绑走了Reid上尉
Kidnappers took Lt. Reid.

263
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:00,742
这其中一定有原因
Has to be a reason why.

264
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:02,143
找到Sebastian最有效的方法
Best way to find Sebastian

265
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:05,146
就是找出他和Reid之间的联系
is to figure out how he and Reid connect.

266
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:07,015
Sebastian说他们是朋友
Sebastian said they're friends.

267
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:08,283
你听说过他吗
You ever heard of him?

268
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:10,519
-我从没听Sebastian提到过Reid -好吧
- I never heard him mention Reid. - Okay.

269
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:12,454
所以我们得像其他案子一样挖掘线索
So we dig in like any other case.

270
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:15,323
信用卡 电子邮件 任何关于Reid
Credit cards, e-mails, everything on Reid

271
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,458
和Sebastian的线索 找到他们之间的联系
and Sebastian. Find their connection point.

272
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,326
我们应该从Sebastian的公寓入手
We should start at Sebastian's apartment.

273
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,828
从未去过
Never been.

274
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,497
你和他共事了这么些年
Man worked with you all these years,

275
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:24,365
居然没去过他的公寓 走吧
never been to his place? Come on,

276
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,033
我有把备用钥匙
I got a spare key.

277
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:30,824
我们得把那辆车拖回实验室
We got to get that van back to the lab.

278
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:31,374
Pride
Pride,

279
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,040
没有鉴证专家能从那里找到线索
no forensic expert in the world could trace it now.

280
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,408
Sebastian可以
Sebastian could.

281
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,811
听着 我的意思是
Listen, all I'm saying

282
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:39,813
我们得跳出思维的局限去思考
is we got to think outside the box.

283
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:42,816
FBI有个新的车辆位置追踪程序
FBI's got a new vehicle geotracking program.

284
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:45,251
用卫星监控车子的蓝牙信号
Uses satellites to tap into the vehicle's Bluetooth.

285
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,554
追踪车辆的行驶目的地

帮我们把一个人从监狱里弄出来

348
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,861
我们黑进了嫌犯卡车的蓝牙

调查它在最近24小时内去过的所有地点

Sebastian在他们手里时间越长

让你惊讶的部分在后面

359
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:43,218
在FBI 我们没有固定搭档是有原因的

这意味着你会尽全力完成工作
Means you'll do whatever it takes to get the job done.

364
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,564
就像没有许可的情况下偷偷使用FBI的资源

你有去申请过许可吗

恶搞的不算

386
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:47,213

-把他找回来 -等我们

所以绑架者劫走Reid 是要知道他"密室逃生"的技巧
So the kidnappers took Reid to use his <i>Escape Proof</i> skills,

426
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:17,330
在他拒绝后 他们就转向Sebastian
and then when he refused they turned to Sebastian?

427
00:16:17,332 --> 00:16:20,599
但是他们拥用这种技巧后想干什么
But what would they possibly want to use those skills for?

428
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:28,541
行动
Go.

429
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:47,392
Pride
Pride!

430
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:52,529
那是不是
Is that...

431
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:55,233
不
No.

432
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:57,401
不
N...

433
00:16:57,403 --> 00:17:00,271
不 不 不
No, no, no.

434
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:04,908
不是他
I don't think so.

435
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,877
Sebastian没结婚
Sebastian's not married.

436
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,211
好吧
Okay.

437
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:11,647
那他到底在哪儿
Well, then where the hell is he?

438
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:21,557
只准锻炼
Exercise only!

439
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,325
不许说话
I want no talking.

440
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,634
最近如何 Mike
How you doing, Mike?

441
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,343
嗨 Perotti
Hey, Perotti.

442
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:44,412
验证你的身份
Put your ID in.

443
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:46,847
哦 对 好的
Oh, right, yeah. Um,

444
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:48,082
这是我
that's me.

445
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:50,418
呃 Henry Perotti
Um, Henry P-Perotti.

446
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:55,156
抱歉 这是他第一天上岗
Sorry. It's his first day.

447
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,624
我很紧张
I'm so nervous.

448
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:01,194
告诉过你 要闭上嘴
Told you to keep your mouth shut.

449
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,096
我只是 我一紧张就话多 好吗
I just... I blurt things out when I'm nervous, okay?

450
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:05,065
这是一种病 还没被确诊过
It's a condition. It hasn't officially been diagnosed,

451
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,067
-正式确... -闭嘴
- officially diag... - Shut up.

452
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:10,037
我办不到 好吗
I can't do this, okay?

453
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,805
这种级别的监狱 他们
Prisons like this, they have-they have multi-layered

454
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,372
他们有多重数字化安全网
digital security networks. I can't just wave a wand

455
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:15,174
我不可能挥一下魔杖 就打开这栋楼所有的门
and unlock every door in the building.

456
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:17,276
你是国内少数几个能做到的
You're one of the few people in the country who can.

457
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:20,279
你从比这安全级别更高的虚拟监狱中都成功逃脱了
You escaped from virtual prisons with higher security than this.

458
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:21,981
另外记住
And remember

459
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:23,282
如果你失败了
what happens to your mother

460
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:25,251
你的母亲和Wade医生会怎样
and Dr. Wade if you fail.

461
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,017
我们现在知道些什么 Christopher
What do we know, Christopher?

462
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,818
问题很多 但答案很少
Lot of questions, not many answers.

463
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,122
Reid上尉被绑架 折磨致死 然后抛尸
Lieutenant Reid was kidnapped, tortured to death, then dumped.

464
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:53,156
Sebastian和Reid上尉一样
Sebastian was kidnapped by the same two suspects

465
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:54,857
被这两个嫌犯绑架
as Lieutenant Reid.

466
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:56,359
不知道他会被怎样
No idea what's happened to him since.

467
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:57,693
但我们知道他还活着
Yeah, we know he's still alive.

468
00:18:57,695 --> 00:18:58,861
Loretta女士确认
Ms. Loretta confirmed

469
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:00,696
我们在发电厂发现的烧焦尸体
that the burned body you guys found

470
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:03,066
不是Sebastian
at the Power Plant is not Sebastian.

471
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:04,300
也就是说
Which means,

472
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:06,869
目前为止 我们可以假设Sebastian还没事
for now, we can assume Sebastian's okay.

473
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:09,138
好的 但是我们还是要确认尸体身份
Okay, but we still need an ID on the body.

474
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,305
这得花点时间
Well, it's gonna take a minute,

475
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:12,874
尤其是没有Sebastian来验证DNA
especially without Sebastian to run DNA.

476
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:14,209
我们还是不明白
We're not any closer to understanding

477
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:17,246
他们一开始为什么被绑架
why they were taken in the first place.

478
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:18,847
我们手头最好的线索就是这个游戏
The best lead we got is this game.

479
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,149
密室逃生
<i>Escape Proof.</i>

480
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:22,151
Reid上尉和Sebastian玩这个游戏
Lieutenant Reid and Sebastian played it.

481
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:23,585
这是他们之间的联系
That's their connection.

482
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:25,120
好的 我们需要了解更多
Well, we need to know more about it.

483
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,820
Patton正在查
Patton's digging in it.

484
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:28,322
他正试着找一个本地区的玩家名单
He's trying to find a list of players in the area,

485
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:31,125
但是这难度这就像压哨绝杀一样
but, basically, it's a Hail Mary.

486
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:31,125
{\a6}足球或篮球中的术语，指压哨时间的制胜一击

487
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:32,560
这仍然是我们
It's still our best bet

488
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:34,728
找到嫌犯的最好办法
to finding and ID-ing the suspects.

489
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,031
听着
Look.

490
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:38,832
我知道这很难
I know this is hard.

491
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,468
我们需要集中注意力
We got to stay focused.

492
00:19:42,072 --> 00:19:43,836
帮我一把 我要和Loretta确认一下
Give him a hand. I'll check in with Loretta.

493
00:19:43,838 --> 00:19:45,138
没问题
You got it.

494
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:49,176
你真的相信Sebastian没事吗
You really think Sebastian's okay?

495
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:52,345
我必须相信
I got to.

496
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:56,049
你们找到我儿子了吗
Have you found my son yet?

497
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,989
洋甘菊茶 或许对你有好处
Chamomile, might do you some good.

498
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:05,057
哦 我 我不喝茶
Oh, I-I don't drink tea.

499
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:06,825
食道过敏
Esophageal sensitivity.

500
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:09,128
没确诊 不过 我还是觉得
Not diagnosed, but still, I think...

501
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,197
Lund夫人
Mrs. Lund.

502
00:20:12,032 --> 00:20:13,699
你很担心你儿子
You're worried about your son.

503
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:16,902
我总是担心我儿子
I am always worried about my son.

504
00:20:16,904 --> 00:20:19,471
只不过这一次 我有了确切的理由担心他
Only this time, I have a real reason to be.

505
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:22,240
NCIS NOPD 和FBI
NCIS, NOPD and FBI

506
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:24,209
都在全力寻找Sebastian
are all working to find Sebastian.

507
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:26,944
今早你告诉我 他没事之后
Have you learned anything since this morning

508
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:29,147
你们还有什么进展吗
when you told me that he was gonna be okay?

509
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:32,383
很明显 暂时还没有进展
Obviously, not much... yet.

510
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:36,120
但是我们找到一些有用的证据
But we have some promising leads.

511
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:39,055
好吧 你们看过绑架案的统计数据吗
All right, have you looked at the statistics on kidnapping?

512
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:41,325
因为我看了 但我真的希望自己没看过
Because I have, and I really wish that I hadn't.

513
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,059
每过一秒钟
Every moment that passes,

514
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:46,430
恐怖的事情都可能发生在他身上
something horrible could be happening to him.

515
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:51,300
我跟你儿子工作过一段时间
I've worked with your son for a while now.

516
00:20:51,302 --> 00:20:54,137
他很聪明 是团队中最足智多谋的成员
He's a smart, resourceful member of my team.

517
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:55,771
他知道怎么照顾自己
He knows how to look after himself.

518
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:59,775
当然了 他聪明 足智多谋
Well, of course he's smart and resourceful.

519
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:02,745
而且他很崇拜你
And he admires you very much.

520
00:21:02,747 --> 00:21:06,282
你是个联邦探员
You are a Federal Agent.

521
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,183
但他是个实验室技术人员
He is a lab technician.

522
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,984
他没为这种事做过准备
He's not prepared for any of this.

523
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:12,154
我们不要低估他
Let's not underestimate him.

524
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:17,592
你这么说我很欣慰 Pride探员
Those are very kind words, Agent Pride.

525
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:19,361
但是如果Sebastian发生了什么
But what are you going to say to me

526
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,963
你要怎么跟我交代
if something happens to Sebastian?

527
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:31,138
走过去
<i>Just passing through.</i>

528
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,406
不要和任何人说话
Don't talk to anyone.

529
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:35,209
也不要看任何人
Don't look at anyone.

530
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:40,881
就是那个人吗
That-that the guy?

531
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,049
你就不能安静一会吗
You really don't get this no talking thing.

532
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,051
对我做了那么多调查之后
Maybe, in all your research about me,

533
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,386
你也许没有发现 处理压力这事儿
you didn't realize that I kind of have a problem

534
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,020
我不在行
dealing with... pressure.

535
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:49,689
对吧 你好
All right? Hi.

536
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:51,857
你告诉我越多 我越能平静下来 好吗
The more you tell me, the calmer I'll feel, okay?

537
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:53,259
我更能帮上忙
The better I'll be able to help.

538
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:54,860
整件事就会更顺利
The more well-oiled this whole thing's gonna be.

539
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:56,128
现在我感觉 对不起 对不起
Right now I feel like... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

540
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,597
看着点
Watch it.

541
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,198
呃 这会让你的皮肤变得干燥
Uh, this is really gonna dry out your skin.

542
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,732
就像是
Okay, it's got like...

543
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:02,734
或者我继续像刚才那样
Just... Or I can keep doing stuff like that.

544
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:04,035
听你的 选哪样
However you want to play it.

545
00:22:04,037 --> 00:22:06,971
好了 我明白你的意思了
Okay, you made your point.

546
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:10,141
在楼梯上的那个犯人就是我们要救的人
The prisoner on the stairs is who we're breaking out.

547
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:12,143
马上要救走
It's happening now.

548
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:14,813
呃 对不起
Um... I'm sorry.

549
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:17,582
你 你说的"马上" 就是现在吗
You mean, you mean “now”, as in, as in right now?

550
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:20,318
他今晚要被转移到另外一所监狱
He's being transferred to another facility tonight.

551
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,785
没有别的选择了
No other choice.

552
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:24,355
你知道这事儿需要事先计划好的对吧
You know that these things take planning, okay?

553
00:22:24,357 --> 00:22:27,658
需要调查 越狱不是那么自然而然就会发生的
Research. Prison breaks aren't just spontaneous.

554
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,126
这次就是了
This one will be.

555
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:32,697
这是个废弃的安全中心
The old security hub.

556
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,631
设备已经坏了
Equipment isn't operational,

557
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:37,153
但还连接着系统
but the wiring's still connected to the prison's current system.

558
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:39,202
然后呢
And?

559
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:41,070
你得黑进去
You're gonna hack in.

560
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:44,107
用这个
With this.

561
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:47,210
你在开玩笑 对吧
You're kidding, right?

562
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:49,178
你的朋友Reid跟我们预演了一遍
Your friend Reid talked us through it...

563
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,912
在他还能说话的时候
As long as he could talk.

564
00:22:50,914 --> 00:22:52,348
他说你能黑进系统
Said you can access the system.

565
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,949
控制电子门锁
Take control of the electronic locks,

566
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:56,619
摄像头 清理出一条安全通道
cameras... create safe passage.

567
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:58,721
理论上是可行的 但
Theoretically, yeah, but...

568
00:22:58,723 --> 00:23:01,089
你知道我和Reid的越狱
You-you understand that the escapes Reid and I pulled off,

569
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:02,725
是在虚拟世界
those were pretend.

570
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:06,729
但这不是
But this... isn't.

571
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:08,896
Reid说这是可行的
Reid said it was possible.

572
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:11,733
要你来实现
You'll make it happen.

573
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:14,302
好吧
All right.

574
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:17,171
好吧 如果我 如果我成功了
Okay, if I, if I can do this,

575
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:19,641
你不会杀我 也不会伤害任何人 对吗
you don't kill me and you don't hurt anyone else, right?

576
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:21,709
对的
Right.

577
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:25,211
Novak 现在来三层 我们需要你
Novak, we need you on Tier 3, now!

578
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:27,213
搞定它
Get to it.

579
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:29,516
收到 我来了
Copy that. On my way.

580
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:37,291
没有Sebastian在
<i>It took a little longer</i> <i>than normal</i>

581
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:39,058
比往常多花了些时间
without Sebastian here,

582
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,860
但我们获取了无名氏的DNA了
but we have DNA on our John Doe.

583
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:43,696
Henry Perotti

585
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:47,800
开始新工作
at Lafitte Federal Penitentiary.

586
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,234
这就说得通了 对吧 Dwayne
This is meaningful, right, Dwayne?

587
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:50,869
这线索应该有用吧
It can be of some use?

588
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:52,004
有可能
Could be.

589
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:53,806
Sebastian和Reid被抓
Sebastian and Reid may have been grabbed

590
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:57,743
可能与他们共同玩的"越狱"游戏有关
because of their connection to this <i>Escape Proof</i> game.

591
00:23:57,745 --> 00:24:00,111
-现在一名狱警死了 -是的
- Now a prison guard is dead. - Yeah.

592
00:24:00,113 --> 00:24:04,349
在拉菲特监狱可能会发生些事儿
Yeah, it's possible something's happening at Lafitte prison.

593
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,851
典狱长是我的朋友
Warden's a friend of mine.

594
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:08,853
我给他打电话
I'll call him.

595
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:12,156
Carl 我是Dwayne
Carl, it's Dwayne.

596
00:24:12,158 --> 00:24:14,091
打电话来是跟你说下 你的一名狱警 Henry Perotti
Calling about one of your guards. Henry Perotti.

597
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:15,726
很抱歉告诉你
Sorry to tell you,

598
00:24:15,728 --> 00:24:19,996
我们今早找到了他的尸体 并且
but we think we found his body this morning, and...

599
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:21,398
你确定吗
You sure?

600
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,067
好吧 我一会打给你
Yeah, I-I-I'll call you back.

601
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:26,737
他说Perotti今天打卡上班了
He says Perotti clocked in for work today.

602
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:27,838
什么

603
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:35,044
Sebastian

604
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:36,779
啊 Pride 谢天谢地你接了
Ah, Pride. Thank God you picked up.

605
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:37,980

Hey, Loretta.

606
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:39,349
你还好吧 亲爱的
Are you okay, dear?

607
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:40,916
目前来说 还好
For the moment, right now, yeah.

608
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:42,151
但不知道能维持多久
We'll see how long that lasts.

609
00:24:42,153 --> 00:24:44,186
-你穿的是狱警制服吗 -是的 听着
- Is that a guard uniform? - Yeah, listen,

610
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:46,155
我在监狱网络上找到了一个后门
I-I-I found a back door to the prison's Internet,

611
00:24:46,157 --> 00:24:47,690
但时间紧迫
but I don't have a lot of time.

612
00:24:47,692 --> 00:24:49,091
好的 你在拉菲特监狱 对吧
Okay, you're at Lafitte, all right?

613
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:50,759
耐心等待 我给典狱长打电话
Just sit tight. I'll call the warden.

614
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:51,926
我去接你
I'm coming to get you.

615
00:24:51,928 --> 00:24:53,228
不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no.

616
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,295
你不能告诉任何人 不能来救我
You can't call anyone. You can't save me.

617
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:55,964
行吗 至少不是现在
All right? Not yet, at least.

618
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:57,833
你得让我先从这救出一个人
You got to let me break someone out of here first.

619
00:24:57,835 --> 00:24:59,167
Sebastian 你说什么
Sebastian, what are you saying?

620
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:01,770
-你想把谁救出来 -我有个计划
- Who are you trying to break out? - I've got a plan.

621
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:03,605
Pride 需要你在监狱外面等着
Just, Pride, I need you to be waiting outside of the pri--

622
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:06,307
该死 Novak回来了 我没时间了
Damn it, Novak's coming back. I'm out of time.

623
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,742
请相信我的计划 如果你们想要阻止越狱
Just trust me, guys. If you try to stop this,

624
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:09,109
他们就会杀了我
they're gonna kill me.

625
00:25:24,447 --> 00:25:25,846
好吧
Well...

626
00:25:25,848 --> 00:25:28,482
我就是觉得自己完全帮不上忙
I just feel absolutely useless here.

627
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:30,251
我能帮什么忙吗
Isn't there anything I can do to help?

628
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:31,586
耐心等着 Loretta
You just sit tight, Loretta.

629
00:25:31,588 --> 00:25:33,487
一切都会好的
Everything's gonna be fine.

630
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:35,590
算了 我有事儿做了
Uh, never mind. I found something.

631
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,033
对不起 我闯了进来
Sorry. I'm-I'm intruding.

632
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:48,167
我知道我不该在这
I know I shouldn't be here.

633
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:49,603
我只是 我想来看看
I just-- I wanted to see it,

634
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:51,371
你知道
you know...

635
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:55,174
你就是Wade医生 对吗
You're Dr. Wade, aren't you?

636
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:56,409
是的
That's right.

637
00:25:56,411 --> 00:25:58,143
你是Lund女士
And your Mrs. Lund.

638
00:25:58,145 --> 00:26:00,412
我听说过很多关于你的事
I've heard so much about you, just...

639
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:03,249
我觉得我认识你
I feel like I know you.

640
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:05,284
Lund女士
Mrs. Lund.

641
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:07,753
哦 就叫我Sylvia吧
Oh, Sylvia, please.

642
00:26:07,755 --> 00:26:10,188
呃 Sylvia 你介意放开我吗
Uh, Sylvia, would you mind to let go?

643
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,790
我不能呼吸了
I can't breathe.

644
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:15,393
对不起 当然 我
I'm-I'm so sorry. Of course, I'm...

645
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:22,300
我总以为他会成为一名医生
You know, I always thought that-that he would be a doctor

646
00:26:22,302 --> 00:26:25,202
或是一名科学家 但是
or a, or a scientist, but...

647
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:28,473
他选择了执法机关 我从没有
Choosing law enforcement, I-I just never...

648
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:30,808
我不理解他的想法
I never understood it.

649
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,310
这不能说是个选择
Well, it's not something you choose,

650
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:35,812
更像是他被召唤 真的
it's a calling, really.

651
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:39,783
我一直告诫他要小心
I spent his entire life telling him to be careful.

652
00:26:39,785 --> 00:26:42,152
过马路前看看两边
You know, look both ways before you cross the street.

653
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:43,953
不要跟陌生人说话
Don't talk to strangers.

654
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:46,323
雷雨天关闭所有家用电器
Turn off all appliances during a lightning storm.

655
00:26:46,325 --> 00:26:49,958
母亲担心自己的儿子
Mothers worry about their sons.

656
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,762
他总是这样一个
It's just that he was always

657
00:26:52,764 --> 00:26:55,364
脆弱的孩子
such a frail child.

658
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:58,801
你知道吗 三岁之前Sebastian
Did you know that Sebastian never spoke a word

659
00:26:58,803 --> 00:27:00,336
从没有说过一个字吗
until he was three years old?

660
00:27:00,338 --> 00:27:01,804
我不知道
I didn't.

661
00:27:01,806 --> 00:27:03,506
是的 我确定他有什么地方不对劲
Yeah. I was sure that something was wrong,

662
00:27:03,508 --> 00:27:05,073
所以 我找了很多专家
so I-I went to every specialist,

663
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:08,376
没有一个人知道这是为什么
and-and none of them knew what-what it was.

664
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,813
之后有一天
And then one day,

665
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:15,183
开关打开了
this switch got turned on,

666
00:27:15,185 --> 00:27:17,185
然后 他就停不下来了
and voilà! He just could not

667
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:19,921
他不停说话 不停的
stop talking, you know, he's just, just...

668
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:22,733
就像他的母亲
Like his mom.

669
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:25,502
我知道 有些人觉得那很烦人
And I know, it's just that some people find that annoying,

670
00:27:25,504 --> 00:27:27,404
但对于我来说 我
but for me, I...

671
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:29,840
我知道 这
I know, it just, uh...

672
00:27:29,842 --> 00:27:32,843
提醒我他过得很好
reminded me that he was okay.

673
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:38,615
但现在我不知道 我
But now I don't know, I...

674
00:27:39,885 --> 00:27:43,186
天呐 他孤身一人
God, he's all alone...

675
00:27:43,188 --> 00:27:45,855
Sylvia
Sylvia.

676
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:48,892
他不是一个人
He's not alone.

677
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:50,626
他有我们
We're with him.

678
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:53,596
谢谢
Thank you.

679
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:55,198
没事的 振作点
It's okay. Come on.

680
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,765
会没事的
It's all right.

681
00:27:59,003 --> 00:28:02,571
那两个绑匪把Sebastian带到拉菲特监狱
<i>Our two kidnappers took</i> <i>Sebastian into Lafitte</i>

682
00:28:02,573 --> 00:28:03,772
去帮某人越狱
prison to help break someone out,

683
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:05,174
而他不想我们救他吗
and he doesn't want us to save him?

684
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:06,575
说是我们一有行动 他就会死
Says he's dead if we make a move.

685
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:08,143
我们就这么放手不管吗
We're just supposed to stand down?

686
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,311
Sebastian是这么想的
It's what Sebastian wants.

687
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,579
但我想的是 弄清楚
What I want is to know

688
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:12,480
他要帮谁越狱
who he's supposed to break out.

689
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,815
让我来点醒你
Let me edify you.

690

Goran Bogdan 也叫屠夫Bogdan

在拉菲特的重刑犯很多
Lot of high value inmates at Lafitte.

695
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:24,525
你为什么会查到Bogdan身上?
Why'd you land on Bogdan?

696
00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:26,761
我想我可能知道绑匪身份了
I think I may have identified our kidnappers.

697
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:29,430
他们是Bogdan犯罪集团的人
They belong to Bogdan's syndicate.

698

Natasha Divac和Stefan Yelich

700
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,634
但BRUCE做到了

701
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:36,402
他圈出了这两个人
He spit out these two.

702

都是塞尔维亚人 因各种犯罪被国际刑警组织通缉
Both Serbian. Both wanted by Interpol for various crimes.

703
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:42,342
而且都在密室逃脱游戏里有玩家档案
And both have player profiles on the <i>Escape Proof</i> game.

704
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:44,477
他们到那个游戏中寻找玩家
Yeah, they were looking for players in that game

705
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,912
帮助Bogdan越狱
to help break Bogdan out.

706
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:47,780
他们就是这样找到Reid和Sebastian
And that's how they discovered Reid

707
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:50,315
两个最高分得主
and Sebastian-- the two top scorers.

708
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:51,751
好 那他们就是我们要找的绑匪
Right, so they're our kidnappers.

709
00:28:51,753 --> 00:28:54,553
但Sebastian提到了一个叫Novak的人
But Sebastian mentioned somebody named Novak.

710
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:56,622
Novak
Novak.

711
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,292
Alex Novak
Alex Novak.

712
00:29:00,294 --> 00:29:02,762
2006年从塞尔维亚移民过来
Immigrated from Serbia in 2006.

713
00:29:02,764 --> 00:29:05,429
去年找到一份工作是在拉菲特监狱当狱警
Took a job as a prison guard at Lafitte last year.

714
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:08,332
大约就是Bogdan移监到那儿的时间
That's around the time Bogdan arrived.

715
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:10,468
没有案底 但他和犯罪集团有联系
Record's clean, but he's got syndicate ties.

716
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,036
是帮他们老大越狱的完美助力
Perfect plant to help their boss get out.

717
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:14,639
显然 我们不能让它发生
Which, obviously, we can't let happen.

718
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:17,108
这正是我们要让它发生的
Which is exactly what we got to let happen.

719
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,177
-什么 -我们要是阻止了越狱
- Sorry? - We stop the breakout...

720
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:21,679
-他们会杀了Sebastian -恕我直言
- they'll kill Sebastian. - All due respect,

721
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:23,280
即使我们不阻止越狱
even if we don't stop the breakout,

722
00:29:23,282 --> 00:29:24,815
他们也很可能会杀了Sebastian
they'll probably kill Sebastian.

723
00:29:24,817 --> 00:29:27,517
听着 我们应该通知监狱长 阻止这件事
Listen, we got to call the warden and shut this down.

724
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,455
我明白这不符合FBI的任何一项规定
I realize this goes against every FBI protocol you got.

725
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:35,558
你不需要再参与进来了 我们走
No need to involve you any further, let's go.

726
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,863
嘿
Hey.

727
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:44,200
我想我已经证明过了 我并没有在意什么规定
I think I've proven that I don't really care about protocol,

728
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:45,601
但这是常识
but this is about common sense.

729
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:47,736
Bogdan有可能真的会逃走的
There's a chance this Bogdan might actually get away.

730
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:49,438
我们不会让它发生的
Not gonna let that happen.

731
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,241
让Bogdan成功走出监狱 这是好事
Bogdan makes it out of the prison, that's a good thing.

732
00:29:52,243 --> 00:29:55,111
我们抓住他 救出Sebastian
We take him down and save Sebastian.

733
00:29:55,113 --> 00:29:57,512
你甚至都不知道他们打算什么时候越狱
You don't even know when the breakout's supposed to happen.

734
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:59,580
Sebastian从监狱里打电话给Pride时
When Sebastian called Pride's phone from the prison,

735
00:29:59,582 --> 00:30:01,316
留下了电子痕迹
he left a digital footprint.

736
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:02,884
我也许能反向追踪它
I might be able to back trace it.

737
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,820
也就是说 我们也许可以密切监视Sebastian
Which means maybe we can keep tabs on Sebastian.

738
00:30:04,822 --> 00:30:06,855
你们听到自己说什么了吗 也许 或许
Do you hear yourselves? “Might be, maybe.”

739
00:30:06,857 --> 00:30:08,389
你们所说的 可能性并不大
There's not a lot to go on.

740
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,590
听着 我们还有Sebastian
Look, we have Sebastian, too.

741
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:11,626
好吗 他说他有一个计划
All right? He said he had a plan.

742
00:30:11,628 --> 00:30:13,694
谁 那个连自己影子都害怕的实验室技术员
Who? Your lab tech who's afraid of his own shadow?

743
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:15,529
他能做什么呢
What's he gonna do?

744
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:16,864
你不像我们一样了解Sebastian
You don't know Sebastian like we do.

745
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:18,598
拜托 这太疯狂了
Please. This is insanity.

746
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,235
听着 我们明白 你不参与这个计划
Look, we get it, you're not on board with the plan.

747
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,303
没有关系
That's fine.

748
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:23,370
真的 所以请允许我们离开
We are, so excuse us.

749
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:25,505
不 劳驾请听我说
No, excuse me.

750
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,607
我有说我不参加这个计划吗
Did I say I'm not on board with the plan?

751
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:29,409
我跟你们一起工作够久了
I've worked with you guys enough times to know

752
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,645
知道你们的方案是值得考虑的 但这次
that when you got a plan, it's worth considering, but this?

753
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:34,513
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

754
00:30:34,515 --> 00:30:38,084
但是 当你投入感情后就会发现这些都不重要
But see, it just doesn't matter when you got skin in the game.

755
00:30:40,722 --> 00:30:43,223
好吧
All right.

756
00:30:43,225 --> 00:30:45,758
我们去找那个小家伙
Let's go find the little guy.

757
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,826
Patton
Patton.

758
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:49,261
一旦和Sebastian取得联系 马上通知我们
Let us know when you got a bead on Sebastian.

759
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:51,730
我们去拉菲特
We are going to Lafitte.

760
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:55,626
为什么我已经开始后悔了
Why am I already regretting this?

761
00:30:56,594 --> 00:30:58,860
你能登上监狱的网络吗
<i>Can you get on the prison's</i> <i>network or not?</i>

762
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:00,529
它不只是一个网络
Well, it's-it's not just one network.

763
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:02,030
而是一系列子网 每个子网控制
it's a series of subnetworks, and each one controls

764
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:02,925
监狱里的不同部分
a different part of the facility.

765
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:03,567
把它们全黑了
Hack them all.

766
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:05,521
它不是 它不是这么运作的
It doesn't... it doesn't work like that.

767
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:10,531
别忘了你现在面临什么危险
Don't forget what's at stake here for you.

768
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,533
我一直记着
It's all I'm thinking about.

769
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:15,902
有一个变通的方法可以访问整个网络
Well, that and a-a work-around to access the whole network.

770
00:31:18,974 --> 00:31:22,675
一旦激活了应急系统
See, if-if the emergency system gets activated,

771
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:25,177
所有的子网会组成一个主网络
then all the subnetworks filter into one master network.

772
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:27,213
我就能控制每一个摄像头
Then I've got control of every camera,

773
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:29,048
传感器和狱门
sensor and door in the prison.

774
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,117
你需要怎样才能完成这些
What do you need to get it done?

775
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:34,754
一个紧急事件
An emergency.

776
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:40,859
我发现了Sebastian用的平板电脑
I found the computer tablet that Sebastian is using.

777
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:43,228
他正在试图入侵安全网络
He's trying to hack into the security network,

778
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,196
而且他完全没有隐藏行踪
and he's not covering his tracks at all.

779
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:47,065
他一定很紧张 毕竟这么危险
Well, he's got to be nervous, with so much at stake.

780
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:49,601
当然 他很紧张 但他从不马虎
Sure, he's nervous, but he's never sloppy.

781
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:50,835
他这么做 好让我能找到他
He's doing that so I can find him.

782
00:31:50,837 --> 00:31:51,870
对 就像留下面包屑一样
Yeah, like bread crumbs.

783
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:53,238
他知道我们会发现的
He knew we'd be looking.

784
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,205
真是不得不爱上这个人
You got to love the guy.

785
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:55,206
我们晚点再爱他
Let's love him later.

786
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,707
知不知道
Any idea where

787
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:58,509
-他要从哪里逃出监狱 -还不知道
- he's coming out of the prison? - Not yet.

788
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:00,745
但他正尝试进入应急安全系统
But he's trying to access the emergency security system.

789
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:02,480
这只有监狱高度戒备时才会用
Only used when the prison is on lockdown.

790
00:32:02,482 --> 00:32:05,115
一有其他消息 马上通知我们
You let us know the second you know more.

791
00:32:05,117 --> 00:32:08,986
Sebastian 告诉我 哥们
Sebastian, talk to me, man.

792
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,733
请注意 各部门 高度戒备
Attention, all blocks. Lockdown.

793
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,101
高度戒备 高度戒备
Lockdown. Lockdown.

794
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:26,903
全部人都给我回到房里
Y'all are on mandatory lockdown.

795
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:30,038
回牢房 所有犯人回到你们的...
Return to your cells! All inmates return to your...

796
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:37,112
快 Patton 赶紧破解
Come on, Patton. Figure this out.

797
00:32:37,114 --> 00:32:39,715
应急事件有了 现在是高度戒备
There's your emergency. We're on lockdown.

798
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:41,650
你进网了吗
You access the network?

799
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:43,852
我进去了 我完全控制了安全系统
I'm in. Yeah. I got full control of security.

800
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:45,788
-狱门 摄像头 所有一切 -我们出去的路线是什么
- Doors, cameras, everything. - What's our exit route?

801
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,822
房子后面的排水管道 我会保障沿途的安全
Drainage pipe in the back of the building. I'll clear the way.

802
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:49,890
走吧 去找你的人
Come on, let's go get your guy.

803
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:54,495
摄像头看起来还在工作
Cameras still look active.

804
00:32:54,497 --> 00:32:56,631
对 摄像头还开着 但是信号被干扰了
Yeah, they're on, but the signal's been disrupted.

805
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:57,632
我们很安全
We're good.

806
00:32:57,634 --> 00:33:00,601
开门
Unlock the door.

807
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,040
出来吧 Bogdan先生
Come on out, Mr. Bogdan.

808
00:33:07,876 --> 00:33:09,075
等等 Bogdan
Wait. Bogdan?

809
00:33:09,077 --> 00:33:10,844
你是指屠夫Bogdan
You mean like Bogdan the Butcher?

810
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,280
-等好久了 Novak -我们得走了
- Took long enough, Novak. - We got to go.

811
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:16,683
他可是一个很坏的坏蛋
He's, like, a really bad person.

812
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:18,885
快走 Sebastian
Now, Sebastian.

813
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:23,222
太棒了 我就知道他有计划
Yes! I knew my man had a plan.

814
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:25,524
Pride 他们有行动了 我在追踪平板电脑上的信号
Pride, we got movement. I'm tracking the signal

815
00:33:25,526 --> 00:33:27,693
我知道Sebastian会从哪里出来
on the computer. I know where Sebastian's gonna come out.

816
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:30,062
他在一个排水管里 他会从监狱后方
He's in a drain pipe. He's coming out about 100 yards

817
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:31,764
约100码的地方出来
behind the prison.

818
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:33,566
好吧 十分钟前监狱里发生了火灾
<i>Okay,</i> <i>fire started in the prison</i>

819
00:33:33,568 --> 00:33:35,234
现在监狱全面警戒
ten minutes ago. They're in full lockdown.

820
00:33:35,236 --> 00:33:37,336
King
King.

821
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:44,509
那是我们的嫌疑犯 来得正好
It's our suspects. Right on time.

822
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:46,511
-我来请求支援 -不 等等
- I'll call for backup. - No, no, no.

823
00:33:46,513 --> 00:33:49,080
我们要先确保Sebastian还活着
Plan is get eyes on Sebastian first.

824
00:33:56,522 --> 00:33:58,822
这真恶心 Novak
This is disgusting, Novak.

825
00:33:58,824 --> 00:34:01,759
接着走 Bogdan先生
Keep moving, Mr. Bogdan.

826
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:05,529
-哦 我们有麻烦了 -怎么了
- Oh, we got a problem. - What?

827
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:07,631
监狱治安巡逻队来了
Prison security patrol.

828
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:09,099
想必他们不知道我们的计划
Don't think they're hip to the plan.

829
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:12,368
关掉发动机 从车里出来
Turn off your engine and step out of the vehicle.

830
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:17,039
关掉发动机 从车里出来
Turn off your engine and step out of the vehicle.

831
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:27,583
哦 情况不妙
Oh, this isn't gonna go well.

832
00:34:27,585 --> 00:34:30,285
该死 再坚持一下
Damn it. Hang on.

833
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:41,830
你说过这计划很安全
You said this was safe!

834
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:43,298
之前是 我们快走
It was! Let's go!

835
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,766
别管他了
Forget about him!

836
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:48,903
快来 快点 走
Come on, hurry! Move!

837
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:50,370
我们走
Let's go!

838
00:35:04,118 --> 00:35:05,852
这真是个坏主意
This is a bad idea.

839
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:12,792
Sebastian
Sebastian!

840
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,434
我们不应该去救他吗
Weren't we supposed to save him?

841
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:38,119
是 我们需要支援
<i>Yeah, we need backup</i>

842
00:35:38,121 --> 00:35:39,987
到拉菲特联邦监狱 我们在追踪一辆
at Lafitte Federal. We're tracking a gold

843
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:42,055
向西开的金色双重载货卡车
dually pickup truck heading west.

844
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,689
P我们希望你有线索
Hope you have something, P,

845
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:45,792
因为我们看不到那辆车
'cause we don't have a visual on the truck.

846
00:35:45,794 --> 00:35:47,093
一切了如指掌
Got the whole kit and caboodle.

847
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:48,728
他们正准备转向
Get ready to turn on the service road

848
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,063
右侧辅路
on the right.

849
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,697
你不是猜的吧
Tell me you're not guessing.

850
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,699
我什么都没做 全靠Sebastian
I'm not doing anything. This is all Sebastian.

851
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:56,002
我还在追踪平板上的信号
I'm still tracking the signal on the computer.

852
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:58,538
他进入那辆卡车真他妈是有理由的
Man had a good damn reason for getting in that truck.

853
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,585
那可真是英雄干的事
That's some straight hero ball.

854
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:00,740
他本可以只把平板
Could've just thrown the tablet

855
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,507
扔进车里 还能救自己
in the pickup and saved himself.

856
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,643
说说而已
Just saying.

857
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,750
哦 不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

858
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,953
我完了
I'm screwed.

859
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:18,323
哦 我们遇到麻烦了
Oh, we got a situation, man.

860
00:36:18,325 --> 00:36:19,924
信号中断了
I lost the signal.

861
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:22,160
我在岔路口 走哪边 Patton
I'm at a fork in the road. Which way, Patton?

862
00:36:22,162 --> 00:36:26,530
我不知道 Sebastian的信号断了
I don't know. Sebastian's signal is dead.

863
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,967
州内所有警察都在往这儿赶
We got every cop in the state heading this way.

864
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:30,435
没用的 如果我们不知道他们去哪儿的话
Well, it won't help if we don't know where they're going.

865
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:33,003
Bogdan刚刚逃出联邦监狱
Bogdan just busted out of federal prison.

866
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:37,374
他应该有逃离计划 离开美国
Got to have an exit plan to get out of the country.

867
00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:39,581
离这里最近的机场在40英里外
Well, the closest air strip from here is 40 miles.

868
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:40,578
他们不会去坐飞机
They're not gonna take a plane.

869
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:42,446
是河道 有很多船只往来
It's the bayou. Dozens of boat slips.

870
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:45,482
有很多条路混入墨西哥湾 然后逃进公海
Any number of ways to sneak into the gulf and then open ocean.

871
00:36:45,484 --> 00:36:48,018
这并不能缩小我们的搜索范围
That doesn't really narrow down our search.

872
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,219
你在哪儿 Sebastian
Where are you, Sebastian?

873
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,991
你搞得一团糟 Novak
You make a mess of this, Novak.

874
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:56,359
你不是逃出来了吗
You're out, aren't you?

875
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:58,127
说声谢谢比较好吧
“Thank you” would be nice.

876
00:36:58,129 --> 00:37:00,162
把那该死的衣服给我
Just give me the damn clothes.

877
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:02,164
然后带我去船上
And take me to the boat.

878
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:27,954
这真是个坏主意
It's a really bad idea.

879
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,830
常见的家用物品
Common household items.

880
00:37:57,585 --> 00:38:00,519
我想我们找到Sebastian了
I think we found Sebastian.

881
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:06,258
-我去抓他 -他会叫警察来的
- I'll get him! - He'll call the police!

882
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,361
我来搞定 让Bogdan上船 等我一起走
I got it! Get Bogdan on the boat! Don't leave without me!

883
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:13,498
我们走
Let's go.

884
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,170
NCIS
NCIS!

885
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,204
放下武器
Put the weapon down!

886
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:27,545
我没看到Novak和Sebastian
Novak and Sebastian-- I don't see 'em.

887
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:28,645
他们在哪儿
Where are they?!

888
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:30,914
我告诉你有什么好处
What's in it for me if I tell you?

889
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,482
我们不会一开始就打穿你的膝盖
We don't kneecap you, for starts.

890
00:38:33,718 --> 00:38:35,185
反正也无所谓了
Doesn't matter anyway.

891
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,187
你们来得太迟了
You're too late.

892
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:03,912
Sebastian 快离开
Sebastian, get away...

893
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:20,661
嘿
Hey.

894
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:24,030
都结束了
It's over.

895
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:35,175
我找到你了 好吗
I got you, okay?

896
00:39:35,177 --> 00:39:36,343
我刚刚

You can let go now, Sebastian.

902
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:55,294
啊
Uh-uh.

903
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:03,000
向凯旋的英雄致敬
Hail to the conquering hero!

904

哦 我真高兴你平安回来了
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe!

905
00:40:04,604 --> 00:40:06,204
小伙子 你为什么要让我们这么担心
Man, why you want to worry us like that?

906
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:08,072
一直处在复杂的情绪里
Getting all emotional.

907
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:10,675
朋友们 我 我不知道该怎么说

908

你这是要表扬我们吗
You're trying to give us credit?

910

是啊 别在那儿谦虚

00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,552
-听起来不错 -别往心里去
- I like how that sounds. - Don't let it go to your head.

914
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:23,953
严格来说 我策划了一次越狱
I mean, technically, I guess I-I did orchestrate a prison break.

915
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,656

- Mmm. - Badass in my book. Right,
