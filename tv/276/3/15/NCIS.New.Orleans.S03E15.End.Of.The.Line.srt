她上班也不能迟到

No, you cannot walk home with that boy.

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,912
我们已经讨论过了
We've had this conversation.

11
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:35,014
他很讨人厌
He's bad news.

12
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,917
不行
No.

13
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:41,487
生活中要我担心的事已经够多的了
I have enough things in my life to worry about

14
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,557
除了不担心

Okay, easy now.

24

任何时候 你想要歇一会的话
Anytime you, uh, you want to take a break,

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,224
CJ　只要　告诉我就好
CJ, you know, just... just let me know, okay?

26
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:20,092
不用了　我没事　你还好吗
No, I'm good. You okay?

Yeah, I'm an NCIS agent now. This is, you know...

28
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:23,229
这个小菜一碟
this is a piece of cake.

29
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:24,764
还是把它放下吧
Let's set it down.

30
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,265
好主意
Yeah, that's a great idea.

31
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:28,901
-我只是有点好奇　-嗯
-　Just out of curiosity...　- Huh?

32
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:30,264
你怎么会又一次顺利通过基础训练的呢
how'd you make it through basic training again?

33
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:30,829
那个
That's...

34
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:32,853
得通过学习和努力
Got through from studying and effort,

35
00:01:32,974 --> 00:01:34,874
这两样你都能用得上
both of which you could use a little more of.

36
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:36,575
我只是想要帮忙 妈
I'm just trying to help, Mom.

37
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:39,612
你只不过是想要Danny的房间罢了 因为他现在走了
Only 'cause you want Danny's room now that he's gone.

38
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:42,014
说到学习 明天就要数学考试了
Back to studying, Math test tomorrow.

39
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:43,349
去吧
Go.

40
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,185
再见 菜鸟
See you, newbie.

41
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:48,254
我真不敢相信他这么快就长大了
I can't believe how fast he's growing up, you know?

42
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:51,590
我也不敢相信我的孩子们这么快就都长大了
I can't believe how fast all my boys are growing up.

43
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:55,494
Danny加入海军了 你在NCIS
Danny joining the Navy, you at NCIS...

44
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:57,830
谢谢 医生 我和你的感觉一样
Oh, thanks, Doc, you know I feel the same about you.

45
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,365
你就像是我从未有过的母亲一样
You're like the mother that I never had.

46
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:00,666
你有母亲 Sebastian
You have a mother, Sebastian.

47
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:01,934
我见过她
I've met her.

48
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,903
确实
Exactly.

49
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,871
所以 这就变成了Wade之家吗
So, what, this gonna be the Wade cave now?

50
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:07,873
60英寸的等离子电视吗
Hmm? 60-inch plasma maybe?

51
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,208
扑克桌 熔岩灯吗
Poker table, a couple lava lamps?

52
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,243
我想弄成艺术工作室
I was thinking art studio, actually.

53
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:14,346
在我结婚前我一直在画画
I used to paint all the time before I got married.

54
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:15,781
等等 等等
Wait, wait, hold on.

55
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:17,183
我从不知道你结过婚
I never knew you were married.

56
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:20,920
结过 很久以前 不一样的生活
Yes, I was. A long time ago, different life.

57
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:23,789
你来看看
Have a look for yourself.

58
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:27,526
是他吗
Is this him?

59
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:28,594
Reginald
Reginald.

60
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:30,096
他挺好看的 是吧
Easy on the eye, isn't he?

61
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:31,831
是啊 那时你看上去真漂亮
Yeah, look how beautiful you were.

62
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,568
那种 不是说你现在不漂亮
That's... um, not that you're not beautiful now.

63
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,937
显然 你很 漂亮 只是
Obviously, you're... you're very beautiful, it's just...

64
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:38,904
你懂得 当你
you know, when you...

65
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:40,840
没关系 Sebastian
It's all right, Sebastian.

66
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:44,510
我们初遇时 Reginald是个很好的人
Reginald was a good man when we first met.

67
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,779
曾经我们也有过几年好时光
We had some good years together...

68
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,180
直到我们分开
until we didn't.

69
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:51,550
发生什么了
What happened?

70
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:53,819
我只能说他变了
Let's just say he changed...

71
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:56,122
不是往好的方向转变
not for the better.

72
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:02,128
来任务了
Duty calls.

73
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,762
看来我有具尸体要检验
Looks like I've got a body.

74
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:05,831
NCIS 可能是同一具
Yeah, NCIS. It's probably the same body.

75
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,199
你要和我拼车吗
You want to share a ride?

76
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:09,969
只要你不继续追问
Only if you don't ask any more questions.

77
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:17,810
这些人会照顾你的
These guys'll take care of you.

78
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:20,513
你会没事的
You'll be all right.

79
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:21,814
是她发现的案发现场吗
She the first on scene?

80
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:24,617
有轨电车司机 刚要上班
Streetcar driver, just showing up for work.

81
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:25,885
新的一天没有好的开始
Not the best way to start a day.

82
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:27,286
大概和案件一样恐怖
About as grisly as it gets.

83
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:28,354
有目击者吗
Any witnesses?

84
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:29,989
新奥尔良警局说没有
Not according to NOPD,

85
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:31,924
希望我们能在监控录像里有所发现
but hopefully we got something from these security cameras.

86
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:32,958
我很怀疑
Well, I doubt it.

87
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,026
凶手把尸体
Killer placed the body

88
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:36,328
直接摆在这些有轨电车后面
directly behind these streetcars,

89
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,696
挡住了所有摄像头
blocking all the cameras.

90
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,265
我很怀疑凶手曾试图避开摄像头
I doubt the killer was trying to avoid cameras.

91
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:41,433
地点过于明确
It's too specific of a location.

92
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:44,503
我的侧写认为 无论凶手是谁
Profiler in me seems to think that whoever it was

93
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:45,538
都想做一个声明
was trying to make a statement.

94
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:50,509
我打赌你不想再约她出去了 对不对
Take it you don't want to ask her out again, am I right?

95
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:52,711
相亲 高风险
Blind date, high risk.

96
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:54,747
我告诉过你 她们不值一顿正餐
I told you, they're not worth dinner.

97
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:56,815
只喝酒就好 而且你也绝不该把你的号码给她
Just drinks, and you definitely don't give your number

98
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,484
直到你确定你喜欢她
until you're sure you like her.

99
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:00,152
Gregorio 那是你的侧写吗
Is that you profiling, Gregorio?

100
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:01,620
那是我的约会观 外行人
That's me dating, amateur.

101
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:03,689
我有过好多次约会 我不是外行
Mm, I've dated plenty. I'm not an amateur.

102
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:04,890
也许能找几个炮友
Maybe a couple of hookups,

103
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:06,325
但是没可能发展成男女朋友关系
but not potential relationships.

104
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:07,893
这简直是完全不同的两码事
It's a whole different deal,

105
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:10,796
还有那些约会软件上修图过度的照片
and this whole airbrushed-photo thing on dating apps...

106
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:13,699
我是说 唯一能确定双方是否有感觉的方法
I mean, the only way to trigger the yay or nay hormones

107
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:16,168
就是良好的 老式的 眼神接触
is to have good, old-fashioned eye contact.

108
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,971
我从不知道你是个浪漫主义者 Gregorio
I never knew you as a romantic, Gregorio.

109
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:21,373
侧写不仅是为了找出罪犯
Profiling's not just for finding criminals.

110
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,342
生活中也很有用的 相信我
Comes in handy, trust me.

111
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:28,847
目前我只知道受害者是军士长Karen Decker
All I know so far is the victim's Chief Karen Decker,

112
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,583
驻扎在Belle Chasse
based out of Belle Chasse.

113
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:32,117
还在等Loretta
Still waiting on Loretta,

114
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,619
所以我们现在还不能把尸体放下来
so we can't take the body down yet.

115
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,020
地上没有很多血迹
Not a lot of blood on the ground,

116
00:04:35,022 --> 00:04:36,322
身上有很多刺伤的伤口
considering all the stab wounds,

117
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:38,157
这说明她是在其他地方遇害
which means she was killed somewhere else,

118
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,391
然后被移到这里
and then moved here.

119
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:40,593
问题是 为什么移到这里
The question is, why here?

120
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,027
要冒很大的风险
Big risk...

121
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:44,330
把她吊起来既费时又费力
taking the time and effort to string her up,

122
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:46,031
更别提对尸体的损毁了
not to mention the mutilation.

123
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,733
是仪式行为么
Talking ritualistic?

124
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:51,070
十字架的姿势表明她应该是一个祭品
Crucifix pose indicates she was meant to be a sacrifice.

125
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:53,739
眼睛被挖走了所以她无法看见凶手的灵魂
Eyes dug out so she couldn't see her killer's soul.

126
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,374
行 那么 我们若搞清楚
Okay, so, we figure out

127
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:56,976
她为什么献祭
what she was sacrificed for,

128
00:04:56,978 --> 00:04:59,678
也许就能确定是哪个疯子对她做了这样的事
we might be able to ID the lunatic who did this to her.

129
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,413
天啊
My God.

130
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:05,150
Loretta
Loretta.

131
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:11,523
Loretta 你还好吗
Loretta, you all right?

132
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:14,059
请把她放下来
Please, get her down.

133
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:16,662
我们去找个梯子吧
Let's go find a ladder.

134
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,201
听着 Gregorio
Look, Gregorio,

135
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:24,703
我会向Decker的指挥官了解情况 好吗
I'll check with Decker's C.O., all right?

136
00:05:24,705 --> 00:05:26,639
你带上Christopher和Patton
You take Christopher and get with Patton,

137
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:29,742
尽快并尽可能多的了解关于她的信息
find out as much about her as you can as fast as you can.

138
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:31,477
遵命
Copy that.

139
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,145
真是难以直视 不是吗
Tough to look at, isn't it?

140
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:36,115
我之前见过类似的事情
I saw something like this once before.

141
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:40,919
我曾经希望再也别让我见到这样的事
I'd hoped never to see it again.

142
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:49,662
兄弟 真难想象有人会想伤害她
Man, hard to believe anybody would want to do her harm,

143
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:51,297
尤其是用这种方式
especially that kind of harm.

144
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,465
20年的老兵 无任何不良记录
20-year vet, unblemished record,

145
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,601
是海军法律顾问 为其他海军士兵提供帮助
Navy counselor who helps other sailors.

146
00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:57,269
是啊 根据她的记录来看
Yeah, a couple of months from retiring,

147
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:58,470
她才退休几个月
according to her record.

148
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:00,072
正是要开始新生活的时候
About to start a new life.

149
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:03,042
可这一切都被一个恶魔毁了 为什么
Only to have it stolen away by some monster. Why?

150
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:07,179
指挥官说 Decker军士长昨天中午接到了一通紧急电话
C.O. says Chief Decker got an urgent call yesterday at noon,

151
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:09,281
急忙出去了 再也没回来
rushed out, never came back.

152
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:10,449
查一下她的电话记录
Check her phone log?

153
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:13,352
放到大屏幕上了
Putting it up on the screen.

154
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:15,954
看起来昨天只有一通打进来的电话
Looks like the only incoming call she got yesterday.

155
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:18,924
但是和几天前打来电话的是同一个人
But from the same caller who called several days before.

156
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:20,292
你能追查到那个家伙吗
Can you trace that joker?

157
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:21,760
不能 这是一次性手机
Can't, burner cell.

158
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:24,263
而且处于关机状态 或者更有可能的是 手机已被毁坏了
Powered down, too. Or, more likely, destroyed.

159
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,765
好吧 还有什么其它方法可以找出电话是从哪打来的吗
Well, any chance you can find out where the call originated?

160
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,767
正在想办法 老大
Read my mind, bossman.

161
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:31,370
在这儿 信号是从Peters中学的
There, pinged from a cell tower

162
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:33,605
手机信号塔发射出来的
across from the old Peters Junior High School.

163
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:35,140
现在 这所学校在卡特琳娜飓风后就被废弃了
Now, Peters has been abandoned since Katrina,

164
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:36,642
谁会在那里出没呢
and who would want to be hanging there?

165
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:37,710
很显然 是某个
Obviously, somebody who doesn't

166
00:06:37,712 --> 00:06:39,411
不想被发现的人 我们可以行动了吗
want to be found. Shall we?

167
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:43,315
有发现通知我 我要去停尸房
Keep me posted. I'm gonna go to the morgue.

168
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:45,851
看看Loretta发现了什么
See what Loretta knows.

169
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:10,883
坏消息
Bad news.

170
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:12,907
见鬼 Sebastian 别那样鬼鬼祟祟地靠近我
Damn it, Sebastian! Don't sneak upon me like that.

171
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,747
喔 喔 抱歉 抱歉
Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

172
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:19,418
你 你还好吗
Are-Are you okay?

173
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:22,755
没事
Yeah.

174
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:25,891
呃 只是
Uh, it's just...

175
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:27,559
呃
Uh...

176
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:29,762
你有发现什么吗
You got something?

177
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:31,697
很不走运 没有
Um, u-unfortunately, no.

178
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:34,867
现场没能发现任何有用的线索
There's nothing from the crime scene that turned up any clues.

179
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:37,469
没有指纹 可追踪的证据 DNA 什么都没有
No prints, trace evidence, DNA, nothing.

180
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,872
凶手很显然知道他在做什么
Whoever did this obviously knows what they're doing.

181
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:41,907
你想让我再试试吗
You want me to keep trying?

182
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,442
NCIS暂时可能不需要我回去
NCIS probably doesn't need me back for a while.

183
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:45,644
玻璃盘
Glass tray.

184
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:47,980
这是什么
What is it?

185
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:50,849
我是说 很显然 这是一缕头发 但是
I mean, clearly, it's a strand of hair, but...?

186
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:52,384
我在被害人头发里找到的
I found it in the victim's hair.

187
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:54,086
但不是她的
It's not hers.

188
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:57,489
很有可能是凶手的
Could be the killer's.

189
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:00,426
如果我没猜错
And, if I'm right,

190
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:02,995
我和凶手曾经有过交集
I've crossed paths with him before.

191
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:17,743
哟 我可不是吹牛 说到做媒 我可是业绩惊人
Yo, I'm not bragging, but I got a pretty good track record

192
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:20,879
不是为我自己 这点你可记住了
when it comes to matchmaking, just not for myself, mind you,

193
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:22,347
那可是个完全不同的故事了
that's a whole different story.

194
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:23,582
为什么这么说
Well, why is that?

195
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:26,051
你知道的 原因很复杂
You know, it's just complicated.

196
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:52,644
看上去我们刚和某人擦肩而过
Looks like we just missed somebody.

197
00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:59,318
“Jack Gordon 氯氮平”
“Jack Gordon. Clozapine”

198
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,752
氯氮平
Clozapine?

199
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:02,454
是治疗精神病的药吗 精神分裂症
Is that for psychosis? Schizophrenia?

200
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:03,649
嗯
Mm-hmm.

201
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:23,976
看上去我们找到Decker军士长是在哪里遇害的了
Looks like we've found where Chief Decker was murdered.

202
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:27,212
也意味着我们找到作案的恶魔
Which means we've found our monster.

203
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:29,982
干得好 Christopher
<i>Good job, Christopher.</i>

204
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:32,117
保护现场 发布协查通告
Secure the scene, get a BOLO out.

205
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:33,819
我会让Sebastian过去搜集证据
I'll send Sebastian to collect evidence.

206
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:37,756
Loretta 我们可能找到
Loretta, we might have...

207
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:41,627
Loretta
Loretta.

208
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,462
可能找到嫌疑人了
Might have a suspect.

209
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:45,497
有前科 刚刚获得假释
Ex-con, just got paroled.

210
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:46,965
Jack Gordon
Jack Gordon.

211
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,367
是 你怎么知道的
Yeah. How'd you know?

212
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:49,635
20年前 我经手了他的案子
I worked the case

213
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:51,937
处理了他的首位被害人
on his first victim 20 years ago.

214
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,609
如果他这样做了
And, if he did this...

215
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:02,614
我很有可能就是下一个
...I could very well be next.

216
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:25,350
她还好吗
She all right?

217
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:26,851
不知道
Don't know.

218
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:28,687
坚强的女人
Tough lady.

219
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:31,756
我从没见过她这么慌乱过
I've never seen her rattled like this before.

220
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,393
告诉我你们的发现
Tell me things.

221
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:36,961
Jack Gordon
Jack Gordon,

222
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:38,530
又叫 “杰克刀”
aka “The Jackknife,”

223
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:40,632
20年前因谋杀入狱
paroled eight days ago from Angola after serving

224
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:43,068
八天前刚被假释出狱
just over 20 years for murder.

225
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,470
Loretta说他当时是电车司机 是吗
Loretta said he was a streetcar driver back in the day?

226
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:47,472
驾驶963路电车
Drove streetcar number 963,

227
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,240
Decker军士长被悬挂的尸体后面就是
the same streetcar Chief Decker's body

228
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:50,542
这路列车
was strung up behind.

229
00:10:50,544 --> 00:10:51,910
很难相信这都是巧合
Hard to believe it's a coincidence.

230
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:53,878
是啊 加上我们在学校找到的血样
Yeah, plus the blood we found at the school

231
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,114
和Decker的完全吻合 这就意味着
is a dead match to Decker, which means...

232
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:57,649
Decker是在学校被杀的
Decker was killed at the school,

233
00:10:57,651 --> 00:10:59,351
然后被转移到了电车那边
then moved to the streetcar.

234
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:00,985
这家伙才出狱不到一周时间
Guy's out of prison barely a week,

235
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:02,153
就立马锁定Decker
immediately targets Decker,

236
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:03,421
并且采用20年前同样的作案手法
and kills her the same way

237
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:05,023
杀害了Decker
he killed a woman 20 years ago.

238
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:07,258
士官Janet Ortega
Petty Officer Janet Ortega.

239
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,895
97年她和Decker在美国海军舰艇
She and Decker were bunkmates

240
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:14,499
服役时曾为室友
on the U.S.S. <i>Enterprise</i> in '97.

241
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:16,501
而且Ortega和Jack Gordon
And Ortega and Jack Gordon

242
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:18,269
在高中阶段曾是情侣
were high school sweethearts back then.

243
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:19,671
大概有情感纠葛
Some sweetheart.

244
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:21,473
没有明确的杀人动机 但能明显看出
Never proved motive, but it's got

245
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:22,741
这是激情犯罪
crime of passion written all over it.

246
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:25,009
是 我记得Ortega的案子
Yeah, well, I remember the Ortega case.

247
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:27,045
当时我是治安官 是新奥尔良警局处理的那个案子
NOPD handled it when I was a sheriff.

248
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:29,347
Gordon之所以有了绰号
Gordon got his nickname because

249
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:31,082
因为他的行凶武器是一把刀
the murder weapon was a knife.

250
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:33,451
Jack Gordon 杰克刀 真可爱
Jack Gordon, Jackknife, cute.

251
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:36,020
但是他为什么刚出狱没多久就杀掉Decker军士长呢
But why kill Chief Decker as soon as he gets out of prison?

252
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:38,256
而且让案情如此明显 他就是凶手
And make it so obvious that he did it?

253
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:40,392
我们需要从之前的老案子查起
Well, we need to dig into the old case,

254
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:42,060
但是如果我没记错的话
but if I remember right,

255
00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:45,897
Decker军士长在审判Gordon的时候作了证
Chief Decker testified against Gordon at the trial,

256
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,465
称他是个情绪很不稳定的人
claimed he was unstable.

257
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:49,100
根据我们在学校找到的氯氮平的空瓶子来看
Well, based on the empty bottle of clozapine we found

258
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:51,636
他现在的情况更不稳定了
at the school, he's even more unstable now.

259
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:52,837
除此之外 他的DNA
Plus, his DNA

260
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,038
和法医在死者身上找到的
matched a strand of hair

261
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
一缕头发相吻合
Doc found on the victim.

262
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,942
这一切很明显 不是吗
Well, it's pretty clear, isn't it?

263
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,878
Gordon出了监狱 要向20年前
Gordon gets out of prison, takes out his revenge on Decker

264
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,480
指认他的Decker复仇
for testifying against him 20 years ago.

265
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:04,816
但问题是 根据Loretta所说
Problem is, according to Loretta,

266
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:09,254
20年前她也同样指认了Gordon
she testified against Gordon 20 years ago, too.

267
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:15,960
我就是当时负责Janet Ortega一案的法医
I was the M.E. on Janet Ortega's case.

268
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:20,031
作案手段实在是 残忍 令人作呕
The slaying was... brutal, sick.

269
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:22,467
当然 Gordon声称他是无辜的
Gordon claimed he was innocent, of course,

270
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:24,836
但是证据是无懈可击的
but the evidence was overwhelming.

271
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:28,540
Ortega的尸体显示出死前曾遭受过暴力侵害的迹象
Ortega's body showed signs of previous assaults.

272
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,309
他们在犯罪现场发现的刀属于Gordon
The knife they found at the crime scene belonged to Gordon,

273
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:33,077
他当时在安非他命的作用下昏昏沉沉
and he was so hopped up on amphetamines,

274
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,479
以至于他在被捕的时候
when they went to arrest him,

275
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:35,914
根本想不起来自己在谋杀案当晚
he couldn't even remember where he was

276
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,081
身在何处
the night of the murder.

277
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,750
安非他命性精神错乱
Amphetamine psychosis

278
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:40,485
确实可以解释那种程度的暴力行为
certainly could explain that level of violence.

279
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:42,187
没什么可以解释
Nothing explains what he did

280
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:43,888
他对那个可怜女人所做的一切
to that poor woman.

281
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,859
我一直没弄明白 为什么公诉人达成了协议
I just never understood why the prosecutor cut a deal.

282
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:49,727
她本应该置他于死地
She should've put that man away for life.

283
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,529
看看现在发生了什么
And now look what happened.

284
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:53,198
Dwayne 在他伤害到其他人以前
You've got to find him, Dwayne,

285
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,833
你一定要找到他
before he hurts anybody else.

286
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:58,036
我们会竭尽全力的 Loretta
We're gonna do everything we possibly can, Loretta.

287
00:12:58,038 --> 00:12:59,370
不论如何 如果Gordon
Still, if Gordon

288
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:01,005
确实杀害了Decker军士长
did kill Chief Decker,

289
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:03,808
那他为什么在案发前给她打了那么多次电话
why did he call her so many times in the days before?

290
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,276
也许是嘲弄她
Taunting her, maybe?

291
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:06,744
是啊 但是 她为什么接受那些嘲弄呢
Yeah, but, why would she accept them?

292
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:09,447
为什么不直接挂掉然后报警呢
Why not just hang up and alert the NOPD instead?

293
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:10,782
他还没试着给你打电话 对吧
He hasn't tried calling you, has he?

294
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:12,584
-他不敢 -虽是如此
- He wouldn't dare. - Nevertheless,

295
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:14,252
如果 他确实把指证过他的人
if, in fact, he's targeting people

296
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:17,055
作为袭击目标的话 在找到他之前
who testified against him, we've got to protect you

297
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:18,089
我们必须保护你
until we find him.

298
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:19,390
我能照顾好我自己
I can take care of myself.

299
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:20,758
这次不行
Not this time, you can't.

300
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,994
在我们弄清到底发生什么之前
Until we know exactly what's going on,

301
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:25,463
对你而言 最安全的地方就是跟我们在一起
safest place for you is with us.

302
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,433
也就是说 CJ
Which means, CJ...

303
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:32,237
我跟Danny谈过了 CJ会和他一起待在基地
I spoke with Danny, and CJ's on base with his brother.

304
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:33,438
好的 很好
All right, well, good.

305
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,973
与此同时 我们需要查清
In the meantime, we need to find out

306
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:38,443
还有谁指证了Gordon并提醒他们
who else testified against Gordon, warn them.

307
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:41,846
你应该调查一下被告律师 Devon Mitchell
You should look into the defense attorney, Devon Mitchell.

308
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:45,383
我记得Gordon曾怪罪他没能让自己无罪释放
I remember Gordon blamed him for not getting him acquitted.

309
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:47,085
我们去找Mitchell吧
Let's find Mitchell.

310
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,621
Patton和我会尽量加快
Patton and I will get up to speed on the old case

311
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:50,855
调查老案子的进度
as quickly as possible.

312
00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:52,690
试着找出相关线索 找到Gordon
Try to get leads on how to find Gordon.

313
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:54,626
-出发 -收到
- Go. - You got it.

314
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:58,563
-我们会找到他的 Loretta -好
- We'll find him, Loretta. - Yeah.

315
00:13:58,565 --> 00:13:59,864
我保证
I promise.

316
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:30,562
有什么需要吗
Can I help you?

317
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:32,397
特别探员Lasalle和Gregorio
Special Agents Lasalle and Gregorio.

318
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,933
我们需要跟Mitchell先生谈谈
We need to speak to Mr. Mitchell, please.

319
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:37,268
哦 别担心 他没做错什么
Oh, don't worry, he hasn't done anything wrong.

320
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,203
但是我们确实需要跟他谈谈
But we do need to speak to him.

321
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:41,172
当然 我会告诉他
Of course. I'll let him know.

322
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:43,007
衷心感谢
Thank you kindly.

323
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:48,046
Mitchell先生
Mr. Mitchell...

324
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:50,782
那就是我说的那种眼神接触
That's exactly the eye contact I'm talking about.

325
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:52,650
明确的联系 毫无疑问
Clear connection, no doubt about it.

326
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:54,686
我不跟你讨论这个 Gregorio
I'm not doing this with you, Gregorio.

327
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:57,255
异性间的化学反应迅速而明显
The chemistry is immediately palpable,

328
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:59,924
你无法伪装 就连我都能感觉得到
you can't fake that; even I can feel it.

329
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:05,496
如果你不约她 我约
If you don't go for her, I will.

330
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,031
怎么了
What?

331
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,666
你们确定吗
Are you sure?

332
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:11,603
我是说 我都不知道Jack出狱了
I mean, I didn't even know that Jack was out.

333
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:14,772
他没试图联系你 给你打电话吗
He hasn't tried to contact you, or call you?

334
00:15:14,774 --> 00:15:16,140
没 没有
No, nothing.

335
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:17,475
你们真的认为他杀害Karen Decker
You really think that he killed Karen Decker,

336
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:18,710
就因为她指证了他吗
just because she testified against him?

337
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:19,978
我们正试图查清这事
That's what we're trying

338
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,679
Mitchell先生 但是如果他真的这么做了
to find out, Mr. Mitchell, but if he did,

339
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:23,314
你的处境也会很危险
you could be in danger, too.

340
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:26,217
没错 我们听说Gordon对你格外不满
Yeah, we heard Gordon was particularly upset with you

341
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:27,652
因为你没能让他无罪释放
for not getting him acquitted.

342
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:30,121
我做了能做的一切
I did everything that I could.

343
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:32,090
我甚至无偿接手了这个案子
I even took the case pro Bono.

344
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:33,491
我是说 我认识Jack
I mean, I knew Jack.

345
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:35,026
他曾是有轨电车司机
He was the streetcar driver

346
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:36,794
我每天上班都坐他开的那趟车
who took me to work here every day.

347
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:38,162
我不想让他被警察缠住
I didn't want him to get stuck with a PD,

348
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:39,697
所以我主动提出为他辩护
so I offered to defend him.

349
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:41,532
所以审判之后你没再跟他谈过
So you haven't talked to him since the trial?

350
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:43,034
他在监狱的时候我给他打过电话
I called him in prison to check up on him,

351
00:15:43,036 --> 00:15:44,902
但是他唯一希望我做的就是让案子重审
but all he ever wanted me to do was get the case reopened.

352
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:46,871
因为他仍坚信自己是无辜的吗
Because he still believed he was innocent?

353
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:48,039
他从来没有动摇过
He never stopped believing it.

354
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,374
这并不能改变案件的事实
Didn't change the facts of the case,

355
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:52,043
但Jack从未真正关心过事实
but Jack never really cared about facts.

356
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:56,147
听着 如果要算账的话 Jack欠我的
Look, if anything, Jack owes me.

357
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:57,782
我让地方检察官根据Jack的精神状态
I got the D.A. to agree to a reduced sentence

358
00:15:57,784 --> 00:15:59,217
同意给他减了刑
based on Jack's mental state.

359
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:01,586
我是说 我救了他的命
I mean, I saved his life.

360
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:02,954
他为什么会追杀我
Why would he be after me?

361
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:04,589
我们不确定他在追杀你 Mitchell先生
We're not sure he is, Mr. Mitchell,

362
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:07,058
但是为了以防万一 我们会把你保护起来
but we're gonna get you protection just in case.

363
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:09,994
你还能不能记得什么人能帮我们
Is there anything you remember that might help us

364
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:12,930
找到Gordon 家人或者朋友
find Gordon? Family or friends?

365
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:14,565
我们尤其关心 还有没有其他人
Well, we're especially concerned about anybody else

366
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,067
可能会被Gordon追杀
Gordon might be after.

367
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:17,468
我们正在列一个单子
We're putting together a list, that...

368
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,637
呃 Todd Borger
Uh, Todd Borger.

369
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,805
Jack的朋友 开夜班车
Friend of Jack's, drove the night shift.

370
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:22,707
你们得保护他
You need to protect him.

371
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:24,709
地方检察官抓住Borger在证人席上犯的错误
The D.A. tripped Borger up on the stand,

372
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:26,177
让他承认了
got him to admit that Jack

373
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:27,478
Jack有暴力倾向 猜忌
was violent, jealous.

374
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,647
通过这个和验尸官的证词
Between that and the coroner's testimony,

375
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:31,416
陪审团决定判他有罪
the jury was ready to convict.

376
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:33,017
一级谋杀
Murder one.

377
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:35,753
毫无疑问
There's no doubt,

378
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:37,889
Jack Gordon谋杀了Ortega军士长
Jack Gordon murdered Petty Officer Ortega.

379
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:39,557
这是我的专业意见
That is my professional opinion,

380
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,959
也是我的个人观点
and it is my personal opinion.

381
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,761
反对 法官阁下 Wade医生
Objection, Your Honor. Dr. Wade is qualified

382
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:44,996
只有权做专家证言
only for expert testimony.

383
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:46,230
反对有效 请只回答...
Sustained. Please, just answer...

384
00:16:46,232 --> 00:16:48,132
Ortega案子的庭审录像吗
Court footage of the Ortega case?

385
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:51,302
没错 1997年庭审法庭
Yeah. Circa court 1997.

386
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:54,872
只是说说 Wade医生看起来棒极了
Just saying, Dr. Wade looking mighty fine.

387
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:56,074
而且气炸了
And pissed, too.

388
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:58,276
是啊 那可不是一般的案子
Yeah. Wasn't an ordinary case.

389
00:16:58,278 --> 00:16:59,844
可怕的谋杀
Horrendous murder.

390
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:01,446
很多情绪在里面
Lot of emotions.

391
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:04,782
是啊 没错 好医生Wade很少隐藏她的情绪
Yeah, well, the good Dr. Wade's barely hiding hers.

392
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:07,085
...通常是谋杀的前兆
...oftentimes is a precursor for murder.

393
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:08,753
反对
Objection.

394
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:10,121
你认为被告患有的
And you think the defendant's

395
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:11,289
精神疾病可能导致
mental illness could've made him

396
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,857
他具有极端暴力倾向吗
capable of extreme violence?

397
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,525
反对 她不是心理学家
Objection, she's not a psychologist.

398
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:16,994
-我允许继续发言 -我没杀她 我是无辜的
- I will allow it. - I didn't kill her! I'm innocent!

399
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:18,563
-法证不会撒谎 -我没杀人
- Forensics don't lie! - I didn't do it!

400
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:19,664
我没杀人 你知道我没杀人
I didn't do it, and you know I didn't do it!

401
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,365
Gordon先生 Gordon先生
Mr. Gordon, Mr. Gordon!

402
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,301
-我没杀她 -你没杀才怪
- I didn't kill her! - The hell you didn't!

403
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:24,435
我没杀人
I didn't do it!

404
00:17:24,437 --> 00:17:26,504
-你知道这不是事实 -我没杀人
- You know that's not true! - I didn't do it!

405
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,306
你没杀才怪
The hell you didn't!

406
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:30,308
我的行为是不可原谅的
My behavior was inexcusable.

407
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:34,912
过去的事总会缠上你 对吧
The past has a way of catching up to you, doesn't it?

408
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:50,461
我不知道
I don't know.

409
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:52,396
总觉得我处理这件案子的时候
There's just something about this case

410
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:55,700
带有个人主观色彩
that I just personalized.

411
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:57,668
我应该从科学的角度
I was supposed to state the facts,

412
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,538
去阐述事实
as I knew them.

413
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,806
科学
The science.

414
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:04,041
而不是给出我认为无罪还是有罪的意见
Not give my opinion on innocent or guilt.

415
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:05,176
但Gordon有罪
Yet Gordon was guilty.

416
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:06,410
他认罪了也坦白了
He pled out, he confessed.

417
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:07,578
可是为什么
But why?

418
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,413
要么他真有罪
Was he really guilty,

419
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:13,618
要么因为我影响了陪审团没有客观看待事实
or did I sway the jury with something other than facts?

420
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,120
Loretta 你在过去的很多年里为无数案子做过证
Loretta, you've testified in dozens of cases over the years.

421
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:18,456
你为什么非要在这件案子上折磨自己呢
Why are you beating yourself up over this one?

422
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,224
你知道原因的 Dwayne
You know why, Dwayne.

423
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:21,859
你看到了庭审录像
You saw the courtroom footage.

424
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:23,594
那不是我原本的样子
I wasn't myself.

425
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:27,598
而且事后我一直都知道
And I've known it for a long time, too.

426
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,768
我只是从未想过去面对
I just never wanted to face it.

427
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,546
Jack和我一起长大
Jack and I grew up together.

428
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:43,848
我们一起上了高中并进入了运输局
We went to high school, joined the transit authority.

429
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,851
那时候 有轨电车来回都是同一个司机
Back then, streetcars only used one driver both ways.

430
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:49,220
我想你也认识Janet Ortega
I take it you knew Janet Ortega, too?

431
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:51,923
当然 她早上坐Jack开的电车上班
Well, sure. She rode Jack's streetcar to work

432
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:54,325
晚上坐我开的电车回家
on the early shift, mine back home at night.

433
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:56,127
基本上每天都能见到她
Saw her pretty much every day.

434
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:57,595
她和Jack在一起的时候挺好的
She and Jack were good together.

435
00:18:57,597 --> 00:18:59,096
知道他害死了她
Until he killed her.

436
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:00,998
我仍然无法相信是他做的
Still can't believe he did it.

437
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,867
意思是 你觉得他是无辜的
Meaning, what? You think he was innocent?

438
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,469
那时候是的 我是说 我知道他有多爱她
At the time, yeah. I mean, I know how much he loved her.

439
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:08,139
Jack一生都忍受着
Jack struggled with paranoia and delusions

440
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:09,340
偏执与幻觉的折磨
his whole life.

441
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:11,709
我以为他的情况已经得到控制
I thought he had it under control.

442
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:13,711
当时地方检察官引导你在法庭上这么说的
Is that what the D.A. got you to say in court?

443
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:15,880
是的 这成了他定罪的依据
Yeah. It helped send him away.

444
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:18,349
好吧 他现在出狱了 若他为了报仇
Yeah, well, he's out now, and if he killed Karen Decker

445
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:20,585
杀了Karen Decker 那你也不安全
out of revenge, then you're not safe, either.

446
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,053
你能否帮我们想想
Is there any chance you might help us figure out

447
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:23,955
在哪儿能找到Gordon
where Gordon might be?

448
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:25,790
我是说 我们越快抓到他
I mean, the sooner we get him off the streets,

449
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:28,860
就能越早保障其他指正过他的人的人身安全
the sooner the people who testified against him are safe.

450
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:30,728
我觉得今天早些时候我看到Jack了
I think I saw Jack earlier today,

451
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,263
在车站对面的马路上
across the street from the station.

452
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:33,998
你当时为什么不报警
So, why didn't you call the police?

453
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,900
我当时不确定那是他
I wasn't sure it was him.

454
00:19:35,902 --> 00:19:38,302
况且 我当时也不知道他又杀人了
Besides, I didn't know he'd just killed somebody else.

455
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,680
-好消息 -嗯
- Uh, good news. - Mm-hmm.

456
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:52,149
Christopher说所有指证过Gordon的人
Christopher says everyone who testified against Gordon,

457
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,118
都被警方保护了
under police protection.

458
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,586
很显然 我也是 拿着
Apparently, so am I. Here.

459
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:58,256
噢 对了 我睡觉不打呼
Oh, by the way. I don't snore.

460
00:19:58,258 --> 00:20:00,992
至少就我所知 不打呼
At least, not that I know of, anymore.

461
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:04,061
我不知道我还打不打呼
I don't know if I do anymore.

462
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:06,430
你觉得我们其中的一个还会再婚吗
You think either of us will ever get married again?

463
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:09,066
噢 我自己倒是不着急 你呢
Oh, I'm not in any hurry, myself. You?

464
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:11,969
如果遇到对的人 也许会吧
If the right person came along, maybe.

465
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,872
前一段婚姻让我挺失望的
Last one kind of soured me on the idea.

466
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:17,074
是啊 不过也是很久以前的事了
Yeah. Long time ago, though.

467
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:22,046
就在Gordon的案子之前离的婚 对吗
Divorce happened just before Gordon's case, didn't it?

468
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:24,081
那是我搬到了这里的原因
That's the reason I moved here.

469
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,284
一个崭新的开始
New beginnings and all.

470
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:28,252
是啊 有许多要经历的
Yeah. A lot to go through.

471
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:33,925
Gordon的案子肯定让一切变得更加困难了
Gordon's case must've made it even harder.

472
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:36,127
我们这是要聊什么 Dwayne
Where are we going with all this, Dwayne?

473
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:38,129
没什么 只是
Not going anywhere, just...

474
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:42,133
我知道你丈夫对你不好 所以
I know that your husband didn't treat you right, either, so...

475
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:44,335
不 不是他对我不好
No, it isn't that he didn't treat me right.

476
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:47,872
你知道的 他疏远我了
You know it. He froze me out.

477
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:49,607
一开始他不是这样的
He wasn't like this at first,

478
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:53,778
自从他开始嫉妒我的成功
just started to resent my success.

479
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,313
事情变得越来越糟
Then it got even worse

480
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:59,383
当他被还不如他够格的人淘汰后
when they passed him over for others less qualified.

481
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,285
他开始变得刻薄
Then he got mean.

482
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:04,188
我用了很长时间 鼓起勇气离开他
It took a long time to find the courage to leave him,

483
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,990
但最终我做到了
but I finally did.

484
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:07,758
我算是幸运的
I was lucky.

485
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,328
比Janet Ortega幸运多了
Luckier than Janet Ortega.

486
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,096
你们都是受害者
You were both victims.

487
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:14,198
他们都是加害者
And they were both abusers.

488
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
但我当时依旧
But I was still

489
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:21,172
对于Reginald对待我的方式感到愤愤不平
so upset and so angry with how Reginald treated me,

490
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:24,575
所以我在作证的时候 我把一切都投射到了Gordon身上
that when I testify, I projected all that onto Gordon.

491
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:26,110
以及
And...

492
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:28,479
在那之后
ever since,

493
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:31,916
我一直很担心是我陪审团对他产生了偏见
I've worried that I biased the jury against him.

494
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:35,252
但这并不能改变对Gordon的指控
It doesn't change the fact that the evidence against Gordon

495
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:37,188
证据确凿
was overwhelming.

496
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,756
不只是你的证词
Wasn't just your testimony.

497
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:41,092
但我的证词确实产生了某些影响
But my testimony made an impact.

498
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:42,960
我能从每一个
I saw it in each

499
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:46,097
陪审团成员的脸上看出来
and every one of the juror's faces.

500
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:51,102
我当时并不是想让Gordon付出代价
I wasn't trying to make Gordon pay.

501
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:53,904
我是想让我的丈夫付出代价
I was trying to make my husband pay.

502
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:58,476
从此以后这事就挥之不去
And it's haunted me ever since.

503
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:09,253
Loretta
Loretta.

504
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:10,755
别动
Don't move,

505
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:12,890
冷静
and stay calm.

506
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:15,559
好吗
Okay?

507
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:17,862
- Gordon -嗯哼
- Gordon. - Mm-hmm.

508
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:19,697
在外面
Outside.

509
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:22,800
等一会儿 然后打911
Just wait a minute and call 911.

510
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:24,769
我去把毯子
I'm gonna go get this blanket,

511
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:26,203
枕头
pillows.

512
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:29,373
这些东西放到沙发上 我马上回来
Put them out on the sofa, I'll be right back.

513
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:41,118
噢
Oh!

514
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:49,260
-放开我 -冷静 Gordon
- Get off me! - Calm down, Gordon.

515
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:50,928
别反抗了 冷静点
Stop fighting. Relax.

516
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,363
冷静点
Relax.

517
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:53,531
别反抗了
Stop fighting.

518
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,199
Gordon 你因谋杀Karen Decker
You're under arrest, Gordon,

519
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:56,667
被捕了
for the murder of Karen Decker.

520
00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:58,869
不是我做的
I didn't do it.

521
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,817
不是我干的
I didn't do it!

522
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:16,320
学校里的血不是我的
The blood at the school wasn't me!

523
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:18,873
你就是不明白
You just don't understand!

524
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,643
帮我理解一下 Gordon
Help me understand, Gordon,

525
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:24,813
你在Wade医生家外面干什么
what were you doing outside Dr. Wade's house.

526
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:27,682
我得吃药 把我的药拿来
I need my meds. Get me my meds!

527
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:30,118
我马上拿 你现在情绪激动
I'm getting them. The agitation you're feeling

528
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,387
是氯氮平缺乏引起的
right now is clozapine withdrawal.

529
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:34,522
你哪儿也别想去
You're not going anywhere.

530
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:35,757
试着呼吸
Try and breathe.

531
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,991
咽口水
Swallow.

532
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:38,293
谁在那儿
Who's there?

533
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:39,861
谁在那边
Who's on the other side of there?!

534
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:41,329
那里有人盯着我
There's somebody looking at me!

535
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:42,564
我知道有的
I know there is!

536
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:44,566
谁在那边
Who's on the other side?

537
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:48,503
Wade医生 是你么
Dr. Wade, is that you?

538
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:50,839
我不是去伤害你 我发誓
I wasn't gonna hurt you, I swear.

539
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,273
我只想让你帮我一把
I just wanted your help!

540
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:53,341
跟我说话啊
Talk to me.

541
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:54,876
Gordon 看着我
Gordon, look at me.

542
00:23:54,878 --> 00:23:57,212
你说你想要她的帮助 是什么意思
What do you mean when you say you want her help?

543
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:58,546
什么帮助 药物么
For what, medication?

544
00:23:58,548 --> 00:23:59,814
不 不是
No, no.

545
00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:02,117
我只想要 我想要她
I just want... I wanted her!

546
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,254
我需要一个相信我的人
I need someone to believe me!

547
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:09,958
我没有杀害Janet
I didn't kill Janet!

548
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,860
我向上帝发誓
I swear to God.

549
00:24:11,862 --> 00:24:14,062
我没有杀Janet
I didn't kill Janet!

550
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:21,136
如果Gordon没有杀害Janet Ortega
If Gordon didn't kill Janet Ortega,

551
00:24:21,138 --> 00:24:23,772
他也就没有杀害Decker军士长
he didn't kill Chief Decker either.

552
00:24:23,774 --> 00:24:26,074
好了 慢一点 行么
All right, slow down, okay?

553
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:28,209
他自称清白 不代表他就清白
Just 'cause he claims he's innocent, doesn't mean he is.

554
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:29,911
他是个绝望的人
He's a desperate man.

555
00:24:29,913 --> 00:24:33,181
没错 但是他宣称自己的清白已经超过20年了
Yes, but he has been claiming his innocence for over 20 years.

556
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:36,050
无论是否有罪 我们都得确认
Guilty or not, we have to be sure.

557
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:38,186
给他点氯氮平
Gonna give him his clozapine,

558
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:40,388
等他安静下来再和他好好谈谈
then talk again after he settles down.

559
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,757
我们还是要一步步的来
We're gonna take this one step at a time,

560
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,159
就像我们一直以来一样
just like we always do.

561
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:45,560
也许我漏了点什么
Maybe there's something I missed.

562
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:46,895
或者是因为我希望他
Or maybe it was really because

563
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:48,696
是有罪的
I just wanted him to be guilty.

564
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:51,166
Loretta
Loretta...

565
00:24:51,168 --> 00:24:54,502
我得查清楚 你也得查清楚
I need to check, you need to check.

566
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:56,738
因为如果Jack Gordon是无辜的
Because if Jack Gordon is innocent,

567
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,474
凶手就仍然逍遥法外
then the killer is still out there.

568
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:09,918
你想要我们中的谁和她一起 确保她的安全么
You want one of us to stay with her, make sure she's safe?

569
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,553
她没事的
She'll be okay.

570
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:14,222
凶手要么就锁在我们的审讯室里
Killer's either locked up in our interrogation room,

571
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:15,890
要么就认为他已经赢了这场游戏
or out there thinking he's won the game.

572
00:25:15,892 --> 00:25:17,959
再开杀戒只会证明Gordon的清白
Killing again would just prove Gordon innocent.

573
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:19,761
你不会确定Gordon就是凶手吧
You're not convinced Gordon's our killer, are you?

574
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:21,296
我确定有可能
I'm convinced there's a possibility

575
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:22,497
他说的都是实话
he's telling the truth,

576
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:23,798
那我们就得继续调查
so we're gonna keep investigating.

577
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,667
我很尊敬医生
Well, all due respect to the doc,

578
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:27,101
但是要在20年间里
but somebody would be going through a lot of trouble

579
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:28,670
陷害Gordon两次
to set Gordon up twice

580
00:25:28,672 --> 00:25:30,171
可是很麻烦的
across a span of 20 years.

581
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:31,906
我承认希望不大
I admit it's a stretch,

582
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:35,043
但是正如Loretta所说 我们需要确认
but like Loretta says, we need to be sure.

583
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,711
好 计划是什么
All right, what's the plan?

584
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:38,680
Loretta要复查一遍Janet Ortega的
Loretta's gonna review the forensic evidence

585
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:41,049
法医鉴定 确保不漏掉任何东西
on Janet Ortega, in case she missed anything.

586
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,951
要让当地警察掘出尸体
Gonna ask the D.A. to exhume the body.

587
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:44,652
也就是说 我要你去Morgan城
That means I need you to go to Morgan City,

588
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:46,162
把尸体带来 送到停尸房
pick it up and get it to the morgue.

589
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:46,819
明白
You got it.

590
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:49,023
你和Patton需要梳理一下
You and Patton need to comb through both

591
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:51,292
Ortega和Decker的谋杀案
Ortega's murder and Decker's.

592
00:25:51,294 --> 00:25:53,695
看看能不能找出两者之间
See if you can find a connection to anybody else

593
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:55,763
除Gordon之外的联系
other than Gordon.

594
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:57,498
药片 King
Pills, King.

595
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,000
如果有人会用20年来
If somebody had 20 years

596
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:00,702
陷害Gordon是杀人犯
to frame Gordon for another murder,

597
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:02,270
那就很有可能没有犯任何错误
chances are they didn't make a mistake.

598
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:04,138
但是如果他们犯错了 我们就要找出来
But if they did, we need to find it.

599
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,040
这次我们需要绝对确认
We need to be right about this.

600
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:08,977
- 这是为了Gordon和Loretta - 好的
- Both for Gordon and Loretta. - Okay.

601
00:26:19,022 --> 00:26:20,655
有人吗
Knock, knock.

602
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:23,658
没事 Sebastian 进来吧
It's okay, Sebastian, come in.

603
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,493
那就好 我不想再吓你一跳了
Okay, cool, I didn't want to scare you again.

604
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:26,828
上次真是吓到我了
Kind of freaked me out last time.

605
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,162
不是你的错 很明显
Not your fault, obviously.

606
00:26:28,164 --> 00:26:29,731
就是个童年的症结
It's just childhood issues.

607
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:31,266
你懂的 暴躁的母亲
You know, jumpy mother.

608
00:26:31,268 --> 00:26:32,834
我觉得我得去看看心理医生了
I'm thinking I should get into therapy...

609
00:26:32,836 --> 00:26:34,969
-那是给我的 -对
- That for me? - It is.

610
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:36,971
抱歉 呃
Yeah, I'm sorry. Anyway, uh,

611
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:40,174
警察把Ortega的旧证据箱留给我了
the D.A. released Ortega's old case evidence from Property.

612
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:41,542
我们要找什么
What are we looking for?

613
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:43,378
说实话 我也不知道
Frankly, I'm not sure,

614
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,413
但我想确认我没有错过什么东西
but I want to be sure I didn't miss something.

615
00:26:45,415 --> 00:26:46,881
我详细阅读了案件卷宗
I perused the case file.

616
00:26:46,883 --> 00:26:47,982
我不觉得你漏了什么
I don't think you did.

617
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:49,384
我是说 每一处"我"都标注了
I mean, every “I” is dotted,

618
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:51,152
每个"他"都在法庭证裁决里打勾
every “T” is crossed on your forensic findings.

619
00:26:51,154 --> 00:26:53,588
至少 你知道 依我看
At least, you know, to my eye.

620
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,758
不能过于自信 有很多事仍然不确定
Can never be too certain. There's too much at stake.

621
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,593
同时
Meanwhile...

622
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,130
你仔细看看这个
...you mind to take a closer look at this?

623
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:04,499
这是什么 你从Decker军士长
What is this, the hair sample you found

624
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,067
身上找到的头发样本么
on Chief Decker's body?

625
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:08,369
我已经确认这个是Gordon的头发了
I already identified it as Gordon's.

626
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:10,872
嗯 但是我们需要知道这究竟是从他身上掉下来的
Mm-hmm, but we need to know if it fell from his person,

627
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:13,374
还是被某人放在被害人身上的
or if it was placed on the victim by someone else.

628
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:14,709
你认为Gordon是被陷害的么
You think Gordon was set up?

629
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:18,246
做个碳酸钙测试吧 然后再看
Do a calcium carbonate test. Let's find out.

630
00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:35,096
你现在可以给我解开手铐了 我不会伤害你的
You can uncuff me now. I ain't gonna hurt you.

631
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:40,001
呃 至少在药效过去之前吧
Well... at least till the meds wear off.

632
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:57,952
谢谢你
Thank you.

633
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,028
Jack Gordon
Jack Gordon...

634
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:11,766
20年前被认定杀害了Janet Ortega
pled guilty to killing Janet Ortega 20 years ago.

635
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:13,968
在你被释放一周之后
A week after your release,

636
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,770
此案的一位关键目击证人被
a key witness against you was murdered

637
00:28:15,772 --> 00:28:17,005
同样的方式谋杀了
in the exact same way.

638
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:18,439
我为什么要相信你是无辜的
Why should I believe you're innocent?

639
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:20,641
因为我是清白的
Because I am innocent.

640
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:22,643
我从未停止证明自己清白 将来也不会
I never stopped trying to prove it, never will.

641
00:28:22,645 --> 00:28:25,246
你为什么在假释期间给Decker军士长打电话
Why'd you call Chief Decker the moment you were paroled?

642
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:27,482
因为我需要她的帮助来证明我没有杀害Janet
Because I needed her help to prove I didn't kill Janet.

643
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:30,651
我说服了她我没有罪
I convinced her I wasn't guilty.

644
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:33,888
那就是20年前有人陷害你了
So, somebody set you up 20 years ago?

645
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,691
那人也在昨天陷害了你 你是这个意思么
Somebody set you up yesterday-- is that what you're saying?

646
00:28:36,693 --> 00:28:38,526
我知道着看起来是怎样的
I know how this looks, okay?

647
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,263
我是被确诊的精神分裂症患者
I'm a diagnosed schizophrenic.

648
00:28:42,265 --> 00:28:46,034
但你得相信我 我爱Janet
But you have to understand, I loved Janet.

649
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:49,337
她加入海军离开我时 差点让我崩溃
When she joined the Navy to get away, it nearly destroyed me.

650
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:51,939
谋杀工具 折刀
The murder weapon, the jackknife--

651
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:54,275
Jack的刀 是你的
Jack's knife-- belonged to you.

652
00:28:54,277 --> 00:28:56,644
我为了保护Janet 把刀给了她
I gave Janet that knife for protection.

653
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:58,379
避免我伤害她
From me.

654
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:01,616
我有时会发疯
I got crazy at times.

655
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:03,785
当我神志不清时 我会伤害她 我知道
And I abused her when I wasn't in my right mind, I know.

656
00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:05,787
但那也是我希望Janet能够
But that's why I wanted Janet to be able

657
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:07,889
保护自己 以防万一的原因
to protect herself in case.

658
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,791
她不得不离开我
She had to leave me.

659
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:13,428
我永远不会杀害她 Pride探员
I could never kill her, Agent Pride.

660
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,997
同样 我也不会杀害Karen Decker
Same way I could never kill Karen Decker.

661
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:18,499
Karen是唯一愿意帮助我的人
Karen was the only one willing to help me.

662
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:20,835
我为什么要杀她呢
Wh-Why would I?

663
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:23,271
先假设我会相信你
So let's say I believe you.

664
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:24,939
那是谁陷害了你
Who set you up?

665
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:26,607
你一定有些头绪
You must have some idea.

666
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:31,245
我只知道有人喜欢Janet
All I know is someone else liked Janet,

667
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:32,814
他们在追求她
and they was pursuing her.

668
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:35,483
肯定是杀害她的人
It had to be whoever killed her

669
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:37,018
还杀了Karen Decker
killed Karen Decker, too.

670
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,853
也许他们认为我们快要接近真相
And maybe they thought we was close

671
00:29:38,855 --> 00:29:40,388
弄清楚他们是谁了
to figuring out who they was.

672
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,656
接近 怎么会
Close? How?

673
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:43,224
你什么意思
What do you mean?

674
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:44,659
昭雪计划-他们把
The Innocence Project-- they gave me

675
00:29:44,661 --> 00:29:46,761
案件卷宗给了我 在我坐牢的时候
my case files while I was in prison.

676
00:29:46,763 --> 00:29:49,297
好吧 我把文件都倒了出来 我什么都没有发现
Okay, I poured over the files, I didn't find anything...

677
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:52,300
直到我看到Janet的这张照片
till I found this one photo of Janet.

678
00:29:52,302 --> 00:29:53,768
我最后一次见到她
Last time I saw her,

679
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,837
在她被杀前一个小时
an hour before she was killed,

680
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,005
她带着一条项链
she was wearing a necklace...

681
00:29:58,007 --> 00:30:00,274
上面有紫色的宝石
with a purple gemstone...

682
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:02,777
但项链不是我给他的
but it wasn't from me.

683
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:04,278
-所以呢 -在她的尸体
- So? - So it wasn't

684
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,847
被发现时她也没有带着项链
on the body when she was found.

685
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:08,382
我看了所有的犯罪现场的照片
And I looked at every crime scene photo,

686
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,617
项链没在
and it wasn't there.

687
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:11,385
凶手拿了它 因为他知道
Killer took it. 'Cause he knew

688
00:30:11,387 --> 00:30:13,221
通过项链能找到他
that it might connect back to him.

689
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:15,590
你可以自己查查这些照片
You could check the photos yourself,

690
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:17,625
你会发现我是对的
and you'll see I'm right.

691
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:21,496
你会发现我没有杀人
You'll see I didn't do this.

692
00:30:27,737 --> 00:30:29,270
你发现什么了
You find something?

693
00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:31,005
我想也许吧
I think maybe, yeah.

694
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:34,175
Gordon的头发上有微量的碳酸钙
Gordon's hair had trace amounts of calcium carbonate on it.

695
00:30:34,177 --> 00:30:35,943
凶手使用橡胶手套把头发
Transferred from the latex gloves the killer used

696
00:30:35,945 --> 00:30:38,333
放在Decker军士长的尸体上
to plant a hair on Chief Decker's body.

697
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:38,844
对的
Yeah.

698
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,048
这意味着如果Gordon没有杀害Decker军士长
Which means if Gordon didn't kill Chief Decker...

699
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,683
他可能也没有杀害Janet Ortega
he probably didn't kill Janet Ortega, either.

700
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:43,918
这也意味着
Which also means

701
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,222
一个无辜的人在监狱里度过了20年
an innocent man spent 20 years of his life in prison,

702
00:30:48,224 --> 00:30:51,125
我的推波助澜送他进了监狱
and I helped send him there.

703
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:07,885
没别的了吗 与其他的凶案没有
Nothing else? No other connections

704
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,909
别的联系了吗 除了她们是如何被杀的之外
to the other murders other than how they were killed?

705
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,410
迄今为止我们什么也没找到
Nothing we can find so far

706
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,446
除了与Gordon的有明显联系外
other than the obvious connection to Gordon.

707
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:15,181
我觉得这太明显了
It's too obvious for my taste.

708
00:31:15,183 --> 00:31:16,916
也太干净了
Too clean, too.

709
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,285
-是的 -如果Gordon没有做
- Yeah. - If Gordon didn't do it...

710
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:21,320
作案的人知道如何掩盖他们自己的踪迹
whoever did knew how to cover their tracks.

711
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:23,756
像是在海军或者执法机关的人
Like someone in the Navy or law enforcement--

712
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,725
但我们检查了受害人的档案
but we checked both victims' records,

713
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:27,860
-没有线索 -没有什么能证实
- nothing jumps out.  - Nothing to confirm

714
00:31:27,862 --> 00:31:30,796
Gordon声称的Janet Ortega的神秘追求者吗
Gordon's claim of Janet Ortega's mystery suitor?

715
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:32,598
除了紫色的宝石项链以外 没有了
Nothing other than the purple gemstone necklace.

716
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,034
不管怎样 被害人
However, the victim was wearing it

717
00:31:35,036 --> 00:31:36,769
在被杀前就戴着它 就像Gordon说的
right before she got killed, like Gordon said.

718
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:39,372
这是Decatur电车站的一台监控摄像机
This is from a surveillance camera

719
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:42,141
在那个晚上拍到的
at the Decatur streetcar station that same night,

720
00:31:42,143 --> 00:31:43,209
20年前
20 years ago.

721
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:44,510
除此之外
Except,

722
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:45,911
在她被害以后
she wasn't wearing it

723
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:48,981
她没有戴着它
after she was killed,

724
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:50,049
就像Gordon说的
also like Gordon said.

725
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:51,684
好吧 这是合理的 对吧
Well, it makes sense, right?

726
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:53,719
凶手不希望任何人找到他
Killer doesn't want anybody tracing it back to him.

727
00:31:53,721 --> 00:31:56,655
你知道吗 我开始觉得也许Gordon是对的
You know what? I'm starting to think maybe Gordon's right,

728
00:31:56,657 --> 00:31:58,057
有人陷害了他
somebody's setting him up.

729
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:00,159
尤其是当凶案看起来越恐怖
Especially since the more grisly

730
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:01,460
越暴力
and violent the murders appear,

731
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:04,897
陪审团就越倾向于
the more a jury's predisposed to believe

732
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:07,032
虐待和精神疾病可能是起因
that abuse and mental illness could be the cause.

733
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:08,567
问题是 除了Gordon的观点
Problem is, other than Gordon's claim,

734
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:11,637
我们也没有什么来继续调查了
we don't have much, if anything, to go on.

735
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,874
但是我们查明是谁把项链给了Janet Ortega
But we find out who gave Janet Ortega that necklace,

736
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:16,342
我们就有东西查了
and we will.

737
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:24,049
才把尸体挖出来 花费的时间比预料的时间要长
Took 'em longer than they thought to dig it out,

738
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:25,518
地面仍然潮湿
that ground was still pretty damp.

739
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,486
幸运的是 把死者
Fortunately for us, burying the deceased

740
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,855
埋在泥炭沼泽附近的墓地里
in cemeteries near peatland marshes

741
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:32,391
可以防止尸体腐烂 分解
prevents putrefaction, decomposition.

742
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:34,226
你真的认为在过了这么久之后
You really think she can tell us something

743
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:35,194
她能告诉我们什么
after all this time?

744
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:36,395
时间可以治愈一切创伤
Time may heal all wounds,

745
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:38,631
但是 亲爱的 若是死了就治不了了
dear, but not when you're dead.

746
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:39,999
仍然很难相信
Still, it's hard to believe

747
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,234
只有你 遗漏了些东西
you, of all people, missed something.

748
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:46,405
是的 如果Jack Gordon是无罪的
Yes, well, if Jack Gordon is innocent,

749
00:32:46,407 --> 00:32:48,040
那我肯定是有遗漏的
then I must have.

750
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,810
我现在回总部
I'm headed back to headquarters,

751
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:52,111
去帮他们找项链
to help them find that necklace.

752
00:32:52,113 --> 00:32:53,512
有消息就告诉我
Keep me posted.

753
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,014
所以这些是
So these are

754
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,849
Ortega的原始尸检照片 -是的 呃
Ortega's original autopsy photos? - Yes, uh,

755
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,317
特别引人注意的是
this is the one of particular interest

756
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,553
她脖子的后面
of the back of her neck.

757
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:03,255
哦 某种擦伤
Oh, yeah, some kind of abrasion.

758
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:06,392
当时 我把它当作跟别的伤痕一样
At the time, I noted it as consistent with other wounds

759
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:08,260
可能是在她被拖进车里的时候
likely inflicted when she was dragged

760
00:33:08,262 --> 00:33:09,462
造成的
to the car,

761
00:33:09,464 --> 00:33:11,664
但在听了项链的事情后
but after hearing about the necklace...

762
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,299
这可能就是某人
It could be the wound was caused when someone

763
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:14,533
把项链从她脖子上扯掉后造成的伤口
ripped it off her neck.

764
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,968
如果是的话
If so,

765
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,938
这可能就是在我急于做出判断时
it could be what I missed...

766
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,074
造成的遗漏
in my rush to judgment.

767
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:29,715
Sebstian可能查到了些东西 说吧
Sebastian may have something. Go ahead.

768
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,417
好的
Right, well,

769
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:34,019
我们重新检查了Janet Ortega颈后一处伤口
we reexamined a cut on the back of Janet Ortega's neck

770
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:36,355
我们发现了微量的铂
and we found microscopic slivers of platinum

771
00:33:36,357 --> 00:33:38,057
嵌在剩下的组织上
imbedded in what was left of the tissue.

772
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,125
如果凶手把项链从她的脖子上扯了下来
If the killer ripped the necklace off her neck...

773
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:42,228
小碎片可能嵌在了表皮下
Slivers might've gotten lodged beneath the skin.

774
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,562
这缩小了我们的搜索范围
That narrows our search.

775
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,931
太棒了 因为铂很昂贵
Big time, since platinum is pretty pricey.

776
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,733
嘿 Wade医生怎么样
Hey, how's Doc Wade holding up?

777
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,502
哦 你们懂的
Oh, you know.

778
00:33:49,504 --> 00:33:51,070
她仍为此而深深自责
She's still beating herself up pretty bad over all this.

779
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,338
不能改变过去
Can't change the past.

780
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,572
但我们可以尽我们所能来
But we can do everything we can

781
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,040
让事情往正确的方向发展
to make things right moving forward.

782
00:33:55,042 --> 00:33:57,710
我们会再和你联系 Sebastian
We'll get back to you, Sebastian.

783
00:33:57,712 --> 00:33:59,011
嘿 我想我可能找到线索了
Hey, I think I may have a lead.

784
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:02,481
我一直在用图像软件
I've been runnin' the necklace from the Ortega photo

785
00:34:02,483 --> 00:34:04,283
查找Ortega照片中的项链
through imaging software,

786
00:34:04,285 --> 00:34:06,719
但我把范围缩小到铂金
but I just narrowed it down to platinum pieces only

787
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:08,053
砰
and bam!

788
00:34:08,055 --> 00:34:11,524
运河街精品店设计并售出
Canal Street Boutique designed and sold

789
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:13,559
一样的铂金 钻石和紫水晶项链
the very same platinum, diamond and amethyst necklace

790
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:14,994
在1997年
in 1997.

791
00:34:14,996 --> 00:34:16,061
如果我们能查到购买收据
If we can track down purchase receipts,

792
00:34:16,063 --> 00:34:17,796
我们也许能找到
we might be able to find a suspect

793
00:34:17,798 --> 00:34:21,200
在20年前和Ortega的生活有交集的嫌疑人
who intersected with Ortega's life 20 years ago.

794
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:23,502
疑犯不会很多
Can't be many.

795
00:34:23,504 --> 00:34:24,670
4500 这么多钱
4,500 large.

796
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:26,038
案件会大逆转
That's some serious change.

797
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,573
看看这个
Check this out:

798
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:29,408
这家店位于
the store is located

799
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,243
Decatur有轨电车线路的尽头
at the end of the Decatur streetcar line.

800
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,880
那和Janet Ortega每天上班
That's the same street line

801
00:34:34,882 --> 00:34:36,849
经过的街道线路一样
Janet Ortega took to work every day,

802
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:38,617
Jack Gordon在早上开车
with Jack Gordon driving in the morning.

803
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:41,287
他的伙计Todd Borger在晚上开车
And his buddy, Todd Borger, driving at night.

804
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:42,588
可能是巧合
Could be a coincidence.

805
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,722
但另一方面
but on the other hand...

806
00:34:43,724 --> 00:34:45,124
若我们能把Borger和她的项链联系起来
If we connect Borger to her necklace,

807
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,759
我们就能把他和她的遇害联系起来
we can connect him to her murder.

808
00:34:49,397 --> 00:34:51,263
还有一个问题 4500美元
Still, $4,500,

809
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:53,098
对于一个年轻的有轨电车司机来说太多了
pretty steep for a young streetcar driver

810
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,633
那个年头一个小时才赚
making, what, eight,

811
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:55,968
8到10美元
ten bucks an hour back then?

812
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,836
对于一个年轻的律师来讲不算高
Not too steep for a young lawyer.

813
00:34:58,673 --> 00:34:59,905
珠宝店正好在
Jewelry store is right next to

814
00:34:59,907 --> 00:35:01,340
Gordon的事务所隔壁
the office of Gordon's attorney.

815
00:35:01,342 --> 00:35:02,741
对 Devon Mitchell 我们昨天到过那儿
Right, Devon Mitchell. We were there yesterday.

816
00:35:02,743 --> 00:35:04,410
这意味着
Which means what?

817
00:35:04,412 --> 00:35:06,645
Mitchell是把项链给Ortega的人么
Mitchell's the one who gave Ortega the necklace?

818
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,314
等等 Mitchell为什么要杀Janet Ortaga
Hold on, why would Mitchell kill Janet Ortega,

819
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:09,515
嫁祸Gordon
frame Gordon,

820
00:35:09,517 --> 00:35:11,116
并且又转头为他辩护
and then turn around and defend him?

821
00:35:11,118 --> 00:35:13,152
这是让Gordon败诉的最佳方法
Pretty good way to make sure Gordon loses the case.

822
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,955
如果Mitchell把Decker军士长也杀了
And if Mitchell killed Chief Decker, too,

823
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:18,057
那案件就肯定不会重审
make sure it didn't get reopened.

824
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:21,026
我们必须找到Mitchell
We need to find Mitchell.

825
00:35:31,405 --> 00:35:32,738
Sebastian
Sebastian!

826
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,775
你本该让事情保持这样
Should've just let things be.

827
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:54,411
好 现在怎么做
All right, now what?

828
00:35:54,412 --> 00:35:57,146
现在 现在你要把你服务器里的
Now? Now, you're gonna delete every piece of evidence

829
00:35:57,348 --> 00:36:00,283
每一个证据删掉
from your server.

830
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:03,219
为什么 无论如何你还是会杀了我
Why? You're just gonna kill me anyway.

831
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:05,721
你背后的实验室技术员没看到我袭击了他
Well, your lab tech back there didn't see me hit him,

832
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:07,924
但是我也可以把他的眼珠挖出来
but I can always carve out his eyes, too.

833
00:36:07,926 --> 00:36:10,560
快去
Go.

834
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:16,933
Jack向Decker军士长寻求帮助
Jack went to Chief Decker for help,

835
00:36:16,935 --> 00:36:18,968
然后她来找你 不是么
and she came to you, didn't she?

836
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,870
快把文件删掉
Just delete the files.

837
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:23,573
只是好奇 你怎么知道我有证据
Just out of curiosity, how'd you know I had any evidence?

838
00:36:23,575 --> 00:36:25,508
地方检察官给我打电话
D.A. called me,

839
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,577
告诉我你在检查Janet的尸体
told me you were exhuming Janet's body.

840
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:29,679
快点
Hurry up.

841
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:31,380
我忘了你们俩有多亲密
I forgot how chummy you two were.

842
00:36:31,382 --> 00:36:32,715
很奇怪你没有
Surprised you didn't talk her

843
00:36:32,717 --> 00:36:34,417
让她给Jack判死刑
into the death sentence for Jack.

844
00:36:34,419 --> 00:36:37,920
是 鉴于他的情况
Yeah, well, the jury wouldn't buy premeditation

845
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:39,622
陪审团是不会相信他是早有预谋
because of his condition.

846
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:42,458
否则的话 我会让他被判死刑
Otherwise, I would have.

847
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,160
那又怎样
So, what,

848
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:45,561
只是因为
just because

849
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:47,763
Janet不会为了你离开Jack
Janet wouldn't leave Jack for you,

850
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:50,032
你就杀害一个无辜的女人 毁了一个男人的生活么
you kill an innocent woman, ruin a man's life,

851
00:36:50,034 --> 00:36:51,901
之后又杀人么
then kill again?

852
00:36:51,903 --> 00:36:54,504
没有你我也办不成这事儿 医生
Couldn't have done it without you, Doc.

853
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:57,673
你指证Jack的证据真是帮了我大忙
Your testimony against Jack really sealed the deal for me.

854
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:59,909
你怎么敢把Jack的事归咎于我
Don't you dare blame what happened to Jack on me.

855
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:01,844
-这全是因为你 -是
- This is all on you. - Yeah,

856
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:03,779
很不幸 对你而言
well, unfortunately for you,

857
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:06,616
你和我是唯一知道那件事的人
you and I are the only ones who know that.

858
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:09,352
不是吗
Aren't we?

859
00:37:11,556 --> 00:37:12,588
Loretta
Loretta?

860
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,876
你还好吗
You all right?

861
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:37,346
-啊 -你还好吗
- Huh? - You good?

862
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:43,986
做的好
You did good.

863
00:37:54,132 --> 00:37:56,132
请告诉我
<i>Please tell me</i>

864
00:37:56,134 --> 00:37:57,567
一直被别人整
that getting my ass kicked all the time

865
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,235
只是做新人要经历的一部分
is just part of the whole newbie thing.

866
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:01,304
因为如果不是的话 我要很严肃地考虑
'Cause if it's not, I am seriously considering

867
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:02,772
重回实验室
going back to the lab.

868
00:38:02,774 --> 00:38:05,208
还是买一堆生命保险
That or just buying a bunch of life insurance.

869
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,743
你的表现很不错 宝贝 你做的很好
You did great, baby, and you're doing great.

870
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,478
只是再坚持一下
Just hang in there.

871
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,314
她说的倒是简单
That's easy for her to say.

872
00:38:11,316 --> 00:38:14,250
Gregorio多年来抓捕犯人 头破血流
Gregorio's been knocking heads and taking names for years.

873
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:16,485
是 她在New York长大 你知道么 而我是在Peoria
Yeah, she grew up in New York, you know? I'm from Peoria.

874
00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:19,121
这儿 把它们敲回去 Peoria
Here, knock 'em back, Peoria.

875
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,892
Wade怎么样 今天早上有人去和她聊过么
How's Wade? Anyone talk to her yet this morning?

876
00:38:22,894 --> 00:38:24,927
Pride去过 他说她已经好了很多
Pride has. He says she's doing much better.

877
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:27,029
-是 因为她也被耍了 -哦 别说了
- Yeah, 'cause she's kicking ass. -Oh, stop.

878
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:28,698
不比Lasalle好多少
Not better than Lasalle.

879
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,766
我听说Lothario又陷入了热恋
I heard Lothario's got himself another hot date.

880
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:31,734
他已经不再是
Oh, he's not

881
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:33,069
Lothario了
a Lothario anymore.

882
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:34,604
你的孩子都长大了
Your boy's all grown-up.

883
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:36,239
另外 这只是早餐
Besides, it's just breakfast.

884
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:39,175
请说明一下 你怎么什么都知道
And, pray tell, how come you know all of this?

885
00:38:39,177 --> 00:38:41,811
你知道吗 一直给他一些提示
Well, you know, been giving him a few tips.

886
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:43,946
或是主动提供 但是他会听
Unsolicited, maybe, but he's listening.

887
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:46,616
组里有一个侧写师真是太方便了
Ah. Handy having a profiler on the team.

888
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:49,318
不是我自夸 但是我觉得我能识别出
Not being cocky here, but I think I pretty much identified

889
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,920
他的完美类型
his perfect type.

890
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:53,456
虽然还不太清楚怎么告诉他这件事
Not quite sure how to break it to him though.

891
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:54,890
-为什么是那样 -坚毅
- Why's that? - Tough,

892
00:38:54,892 --> 00:38:57,426
忠诚 聪明 活跃
loyal, whip-smart, sassy,

893
00:38:57,428 --> 00:39:00,930
可以陪伴男孩 得到多少就付出多少
can hang with the boys, and gives as good as she gets.

894
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:04,734
- Percy -Percy
-Percy?-Percy?

895
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:08,271
像我说的 还不清楚怎么告诉他这件事
Like I said, not quite sure how to break it to him.

896
00:39:09,774 --> 00:39:10,806
你去哪里
Where you going?

897
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:12,642
我也要给自己找点儿药吃
I'm going to get me some pills, too.

898
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:15,778
想到他们在一起我就头疼
Just the thought of them together makes my head hurt.

899
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:26,989
我从来不会厌倦开着电车穿过城市
Never got tired of driving a streetcar through the city.

900
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:29,825
这是一份好工作
It's a great job.

901
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:32,228
爱工作的每一分钟
Loved every minute of it.

902
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:37,066
也许我可以帮点儿忙
Might be able to pull some strings,

903
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:40,436
看看我能否让你重拾工作
see if I can get you your-your job back.

904
00:39:40,438 --> 00:39:43,105
你现在是自由的 Jack 除此之外 这个城市和政府
You're a free man now, Jack. Besides, the city and the state,

905
00:39:43,107 --> 00:39:46,809
-欠你的不止这些 -可是
- they owe you more than that. - Still,

906
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:49,779
突然出狱并洗脱了罪名还是让我
it's a little scary being out all of a sudden,

907
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:51,547
有点害怕
cleared.

908
00:39:51,549 --> 00:39:54,116
我花了这么多年尝试证明我的清白
I spent so many years trying to prove my innocence,

909
00:39:54,118 --> 00:39:56,919
我都没怎么想 如果我成功了该去做什么
I didn't think much about what I'd do if I succeeded.

910
00:39:56,921 --> 00:40:01,157
教习所可以帮你去适应
Well, the-the halfway house can help you adjust.

911
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,625
我也可以
So can I.

912
00:40:02,627 --> 00:40:04,527
Wade医生也可以
So can Dr. Wade.

913
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:08,297
这就是你来见我 和我一起坐车的原因么
Is that why you wanted to meet, ride with me?

914
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:11,534
只是其中一个原因
One of the reasons.

915
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:13,169
听着
Look...

916
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:18,140
你向她寻求帮助
...you were right to...

917
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:21,277
是正确的
go to her for help.

918
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:24,847
现在也没有理由停止 Jack
There's no reason to stop now, Jack.

919
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:27,917
她为发生的事感到很难过
She feels bad about what happened,

920
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,618
比她应得的还难过
more than she deserves.

921
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:33,489
难过 天 她不是才帮我洗脱罪名了么
Bad? Hell, didn't she just help exonerate me?

922
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:37,693
而且 我从来没有怪过她
Anyway, I never held anything against her.

923
00:40:37,695 --> 00:40:39,328
我的意思是 她什么都没有做错
I mean, she didn't do anything wrong.

924
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,397
我 我伤害了Janet
I... I hurt Janet.

925
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,699
而这事儿被用来反击我
Got used against me.

926
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:46,035
所有她做的只是说了出来
All she did was say it.

927
00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:47,636
事实上
Actually,

928
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:49,939
或许是她最后救了我的命
she probably ended up saving my life,

929
00:40:49,941 --> 00:40:52,975
因为我的情况让陪审团同情我
getting the jury to take pity on me 'cause of my condition.

930
00:40:52,977 --> 00:40:54,677
那么你也有可能接受我来找你谈话的
Then maybe you'll be open to the other reason

931
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,945
另一个原因
I wanted to talk to you.

932
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:58,347
这个优秀的医生在无辜者计划中
The good doctor's donated her time

933
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:01,016
贡献了她多年的时间
to the Innocence Project for a lot of years.

934
00:41:01,018 --> 00:41:04,987
你能否用你所了解的 去帮助其他遭受错误监禁的人
Could you use what you learned to help others wrongly imprisoned.

935
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:08,124
这也许会给你一些方向
Might give you some direction.

936
00:41:08,126 --> 00:41:12,561
也许 能帮助你们两个有所恢复
Maybe... help the two of you heal a little bit.

937
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:16,298
有兴趣吗
Interested?

938
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:28,911
收藏么
Storage?

939
00:41:28,913 --> 00:41:31,113
不 垃圾
No. Trash.

940
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:33,916
我不会再背负沉重的过去
I'm not gonna let the past weigh me down any longer.

941
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:36,051
是时候前进了
It's time to move on.

942
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:39,655
除非你想让我多聊聊我的前夫来烦你
Unless you want me to bore you with more talk of my ex-husband.

943
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:40,890
我要出去了
I'm out of here.

944
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:43,125
那正是我想要的
Mm, that's what I thought.

945
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:10,686
谢谢
Thank you.

946
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:18,794
你想进来喝杯茶么 Gordon先生
Would you like to come in for some tea, Mr. Gordon?

947
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:23,115
当然
Sure.
