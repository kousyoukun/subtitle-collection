CJ, you know, just...
just let me know, okay?

27
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,145
                   No, I'm good.
                       You okay?

28
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,814
  Yeah, I'm an NCIS agent now.
      This is, you know...

29
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,282
          (straining):
    this is a piece of cake.

30
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:24,716
          (straining):
       Let's set it down.

31
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,118
Yeah, that's a great idea.

32
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,154
    Just out of curiosity...
Huh?

33
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,656
       how'd you make it
 through basic training again?

34
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:33,158
That's...
                Got through from
            studying and effort,

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,860
both of which you could
use a little more of.

36
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,628
 I'm just trying to help, Mom.

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,665
      Only 'cause you want
Danny's room now that he's gone.

38
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,800
       Back to studying,
      Math test tomorrow.

39
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,302
              Go.

40
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:46,205
                See you, newbie.

41
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,240
        I can't believe how fast
      he's growing up, you know?

42
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:51,577
I can't believe how fast
all my boys are growing up.

43
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,481
Danny joining the Navy,
you at NCIS...

44
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,883
Oh, thanks, Doc, you know
I feel the same about you.

45
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,351
     You're like the mother
       that I never had.

46
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,652
 You have a mother, Sebastian.

47
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,154
         I've met her.

48
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,189
Exactly.

49
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,891
    So, what, this gonna be
       the Wade cave now?

50
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,193
Hmm? 60-inch plasma maybe?

51
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,328
          Poker table,
      a couple lava lamps?

52
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,330
   I was thinking art studio,
           actually.

53
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,399
    I used to paint all the time
           before I got married.

54
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,834
      Wait, wait, hold on.

55
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,269
I never knew
you were married.

56
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,173
          Yes, I was.
A long time ago, different life.

57
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,709
   Have a look for yourself.

58
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,646
          Is this him?

59
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,647
             WADE:
           Reginald.

60
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,182
   Easy on the eye, isn't he?

61
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,750
    Yeah, look how beautiful
           you were.

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,687
     That's... um, not that
   you're not beautiful now.

63
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,157
  Obviously, you're... you're
  very beautiful, it's just...

64
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,158
you know, when you...

65
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,926
   It's all right, Sebastian.

66
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,630
    Reginald was a good man
       when we first met.

67
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,798
     We had some good years
          together...

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,300
        until we didn't.

69
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,603
         What happened?

70
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,872
  Let's just say he changed...

71
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,175
      not for the better.

72
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,743
       (cell phone beeps)

73
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,247
             WADE:
          Duty calls.

74
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,882
     Looks like I've got a body.

75
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,918
Yeah, NCIS.
It's probably the same body.

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,386
You want to share a ride?

77
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,955
     Only if you don't ask
      any more questions.

78
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,627
        (siren wailing,
  helicopter blades whirring)

79
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,896
          LASALLE: These guys'll
               take care of you.

80
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,599
            You'll be all right.

81
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,967
She the first on scene?

82
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,736
          Streetcar driver, just
            showing up for work.

83
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,971
Not the best way
to start a day.

84
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,406
About as grisly as it gets.

85
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:28,440
                  Any witnesses?

86
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,908
Not according to NOPD,

87
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,244
but hopefully we got something
from these security cameras.

88
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,245
               Well, I doubt it.

89
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,847
Killer placed the body

90
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,448
directly behind
these streetcars,

91
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,816
       blocking all the cameras.

92
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,384
I doubt the killer was
trying to avoid cameras.

93
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,553
It's too specific
of a location.

94
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,623
Profiler in me seems
to think that whoever it was

95
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,657
was trying
to make a statement.

96
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,960
       (cell phone beeps)

97
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,629
   Take it you don't want to ask
      her out again, am I right?

98
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,898
          Blind date, high risk.

99
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
          I told you,
   they're not worth dinner.

100
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,002
Just drinks, and you definitely
     don't give your number

101
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,604
               until you're sure
                   you like her.

102
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,272
Is that you profiling,
Gregorio?

103
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,807
   That's me dating, amateur.

104
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,875
Mm, I've dated plenty.
I'm not an amateur.

105
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:04,943
      Maybe a couple of hookups,

106
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,478
               but not potential
                  relationships.

107
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,280
    It's a whole different deal,

108
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,983
and this whole airbrushed-photo
    thing on dating apps...

109
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:13,919
I mean, the only way to trigger
    the yay or nay hormones

110
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,355
        is to have good,
   old-fashioned eye contact.

111
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,024
        I never knew you
    as a romantic, Gregorio.

112
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,560
      Profiling's not just
     for finding criminals.

113
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,395
   Comes in handy, trust me.

114
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,799
   (camera shutter clicking)

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,034
    All I know so far is the
  victim's Chief Karen Decker,

116
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,769
   based out of Belle Chasse.

117
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,337
       Still waiting on Loretta,

118
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,872
                so we can't take
              the body down yet.

119
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:34,973
       Not a lot of blood
         on the ground,

120
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,541
considering all the stab wounds,

121
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,343
   which means she was killed
        somewhere else,

122
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,544
      and then moved here.

123
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,779
The question is, why here?

124
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,281
          Big risk...

125
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,516
   taking the time and effort
       to string her up,

126
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,018
 not to mention the mutilation.

127
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,919
      Talking ritualistic?

128
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,290
Crucifix pose indicates
she was meant to be a sacrifice.

129
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,925
    Eyes dug out so she couldn't
          see her killer's soul.

130
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,560
PRIDE:
Okay, so, we figure out

131
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,995
  what she was sacrificed for,

132
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,931
     we might be able to ID
the lunatic who did this to her.

133
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,533
                           WADE:
                         My God.

134
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,070
                        Loretta.

135
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,777
         Loretta, you all right?

136
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,379
     Please, get her down.

137
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,782
    Let's go find a ladder.

138
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,521
                 Look, Gregorio,

139
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,023
 I'll check with Decker's C.O.,
           all right?

140
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,958
      You take Christopher
      and get with Patton,

141
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,995
   find out as much about her
 as you can as fast as you can.

142
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,797
                      Copy that.

143
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,465
               Tough to look at,
                       isn't it?

144
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:36,435
   I saw something like this
          once before.

145
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:41,039
I'd hoped never to see it again.

146
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:49,915
  Man, hard to believe anybody
   would want to do her harm,

147
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,550
 especially that kind of harm.

148
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,719
20-year vet,
unblemished record,

149
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,921
Navy counselor who
helps other sailors.

150
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,489
               Yeah, a couple of
           months from retiring,

151
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,724
        according to her record.

152
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,392
      About to start a new life.

153
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:03,428
  Only to have it stolen away
     by some monster. Why?

154
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,499
 C.O. says Chief Decker got an
 urgent call yesterday at noon,

155
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,601
  rushed out, never came back.

156
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,836
      Check her phone log?

157
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,739
                   Putting it up
                  on the screen.

158
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,108
            PATTON:
  Looks like the only incoming
    call she got yesterday.

159
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,444
GREGORIO:
But from the same caller
who called several days before.

160
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,612
       Can you trace that joker?

161
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,147
      Can't, burner cell.

162
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,649
       Powered down, too.
  Or, more likely, destroyed.

163
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,085
   Well, any chance you can find
  out where the call originated?

164
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,154
     Read my mind, bossman.

165
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,757
                   There, pinged
               from a cell tower

166
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,959
             across from the old
      Peters Junior High School.

167
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,527
      Now, Peters has been
    abandoned since Katrina,

168
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,962
       and who would want
      to be hanging there?

169
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,029
GREGORIO: Obviously,
somebody who doesn't

170
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,765
     want to be found. Shall we?

171
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:43,602
        Keep me posted.
  I'm gonna go to the morgue.

172
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:46,037
    See what Loretta knows.

173
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,762
   (camera shutters clicking)

174
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,532
                       Bad news.
Damn it, Sebastian!
Don't sneak upon me like that.

175
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,000
          Whoa, whoa,
     I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

176
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,671
               Are-Are you okay?

177
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,108
             Yeah.

178
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,445
        Uh, it's just...

179
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,946
Uh...

180
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,115
       You got something?

181
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,150
        Um, u-unfortunately, no.

182
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:35,520
  There's nothing from the crime
 scene that turned up any clues.

183
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,923
      No prints, trace evidence,
                   DNA, nothing.

184
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,525
   Whoever did this obviously
   knows what they're doing.

185
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,527
                     You want me
                 to keep trying?

186
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,829
     NCIS probably doesn't
    need me back for awhile.

187
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,897
          Glass tray.

188
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,200
          What is it?

189
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:51,236
        I mean, clearly,
 it's a strand of hair, but...?

190
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,771
WADE: I found it
in the victim's hair.

191
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,539
         It's not hers.

192
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,742
     Could be the killer's.

193
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,846
       And, if I'm right,

194
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,515
       I've crossed paths
        with him before.

195
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,196
Yo, I'm not bragging, but I got
   a pretty good track record

196
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,533
when it comes to matchmaking,
just not for myself, mind you,

197
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,767
that's a whole
different story.

198
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,102
Well, why is that?

199
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,571
                  You know, it's
               just complicated.

200
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,907
       (hinges creaking,
         door clatters)

201
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,964
              Looks like we just
                missed somebody.

202
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,804
         "Jack Gordon.
           Clozapine"

203
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,239
                        LASALLE:
                      Clozapine?

204
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,942
        Is that for psychosis?
            Schizophrenia?
Mm-hmm.

205
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,329
     Looks like we've found
where Chief Decker was murdered.

206
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:27,599
    Which means we've found
          our monster.

207
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,335
             PRIDE:
     <i> Good job, Christopher.</i>

208
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,704
       Secure the scene,
        get a BOLO out.

209
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,339
      I'll send Sebastian
      to collect evidence.

210
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,974
       (phone beeps off)

211
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,143
   Loretta, we might have...

212
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,147
            Loretta.

213
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,982
           Might have a suspect.

214
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,017
   Ex-con, just got paroled.

215
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,285
          Jack Gordon.

216
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,887
     Yeah. How'd you know?

217
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,221
       I worked the case

218
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,324
      on his first victim
         20 years ago.

219
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,996
     And, if he did this...

220
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,001
 ...I could very well be next.

221
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,685
  (jazz music playing nearby)

222
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,623
         She all right?

223
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,124
          Don't know.

224
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,026
          Tough lady.

225
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:31,029
      I've never seen her
   rattled like this before.

226
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,197
         (Pride sighs)

227
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,633
        Tell me things.

228
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,101
                    Jack Gordon,

229
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,869
      aka "The Jackknife,"

230
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,971
     paroled eight days ago
   from Angola after serving

231
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,140
              just over 20 years
                     for murder.

232
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,743
Loretta said he was a streetcar
driver back in the day?

233
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,745
  Drove streetcar number 963,

234
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,279
the same streetcar
Chief Decker's body

235
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,848
was strung up behind.

236
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,216
        Hard to believe
      it's a coincidence.

237
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,218
            Yeah, plus the blood
          we found at the school

238
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,220
              is a dead match to
          Decker, which means...

239
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,988
Decker was killed at the school,

240
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,823
  then moved to the streetcar.

241
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,125
           GREGORIO:
      Guy's out of prison
         barely a week,

242
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,292
     immediately targets Decker,

243
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,827
      and kills her the same way

244
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,195
               he killed a woman
                   20 years ago.

245
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,398
            LASALLE:
  Petty Officer Janet Ortega.

246
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,301
 She and Decker were bunkmates

247
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:13,838
on the U.S.S.<i> Enterprise</i> in '97.

248
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
      And Ortega and Jack Gordon

249
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,442
were high school
sweethearts back then.

250
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,010
       GREGORIO (scoffs):
        Some sweetheart.

251
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,845
Never proved motive,
but it's got

252
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,080
        crime of passion
      written all over it.

253
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,149
Yeah, well, I remember
the Ortega case.

254
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,151
NOPD handled it
when I was a sheriff.

255
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,687
Gordon got his nickname because

256
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,221
  the murder weapon was a knife.

257
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,824
   Jack Gordon, Jackknife, cute.

258
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,226
    But why kill Chief Decker as
  soon as he gets out of prison?

259
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,429
          And make it so obvious
                 that he did it?

260
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,698
            Well, we need to dig
              into the old case,

261
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,232
but if I remember right,

262
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:45,203
          Chief Decker testified
    against Gordon at the trial,

263
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,805
    claimed he was unstable.

264
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,239
Well, based on the empty bottle
of clozapine we found

265
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,975
at the school,
he's even more unstable now.

266
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,143
                   Plus, his DNA

267
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,344
    matched a strand of hair

268
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,313
    Doc found on the victim.

269
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,182
                        LASALLE:
               Well, it's pretty
                clear, isn't it?

270
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,350
   Gordon gets out of prison,
takes out his revenge on Decker

271
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,953
   for testifying against him
         20 years ago.

272
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,289
          Problem is,
     according to Loretta,

273
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:08,326
  she testified against Gordon
       20 years ago, too.

274
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,233
         I was the M.E.
    on Janet Ortega's case.

275
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,270
       The slaying was...
         brutal, sick.

276
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,906
           Gordon claimed he was
            innocent, of course,

277
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,309
        but the evidence
       was overwhelming.

278
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:27,979
   Ortega's body showed signs
     of previous assaults.

279
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,515
  The knife they found at the
crime scene belonged to Gordon,

280
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,283
    and he was so hopped up
        on amphetamines,

281
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,952
 when they went to arrest him,

282
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,286
   he couldn't even remember
          where he was

283
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,354
    the night of the murder.

284
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,156
           GREGORIO:
     Amphetamine psychosis

285
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,924
    certainly could explain
    that level of violence.

286
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,392
WADE:
Nothing explains
what he did

287
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,328
      to that poor woman.

288
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,298
    I just never understood
 why the prosecutor cut a deal.

289
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,134
       She should've put
    that man away for life.

290
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,002
  And now look what happened.

291
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,403
                   You've got to
               find him, Dwayne,

292
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,305
 before he hurts anybody else.

293
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:57,275
   We're gonna do everything
   we possibly can, Loretta.

294
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,843
Still, if Gordon

295
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,345
     did kill Chief Decker,

296
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,248
  why did he call her so many
   times in the days before?

297
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,549
            Taunting her, maybe?

298
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,251
            Yeah, but, why would
                she accept them?

299
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,920
        Why not just hang up and
         alert the NOPD instead?

300
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,388
He hasn't tried
calling you, has he?

301
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,090
       He wouldn't dare.
                       GREGORIO:
                   Nevertheless,

302
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,558
               if, in fact, he's
                targeting people

303
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,327
   who testified against him,
    we've got to protect you

304
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,362
              until we find him.

305
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,863
   I can take care of myself.

306
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,265
PRIDE:
Not this time, you can't.

307
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,433
         Until we know
    exactly what's going on,

308
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,803
safest place for you is with us.

309
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,939
       Which means, CJ...

310
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,509
    I spoke with Danny, and CJ's
       on base with his brother.

311
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,944
     All right, well, good.

312
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,312
        In the meantime,
      we need to find out

313
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,382
       who else testified
   against Gordon, warn them.

314
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:40,985
You should look into the defense
   attorney, Devon Mitchell.

315
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,289
    I remember Gordon blamed him
  for not getting him acquitted.

316
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,990
      Let's find Mitchell.

317
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,493
Patton and I will get
up to speed on the old case

318
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,994
as quickly as possible.

319
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,863
        Try to get leads
     on how to find Gordon.

320
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,398
              Go.
LASALLE:
You got it.

321
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,535
We'll find him, Loretta.
                           Yeah.

322
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,903
           I promise.

323
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,045

324
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,882

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,997
         (door closing)

326
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,601
        Can I help you?

327
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,436
         LASALLE: Special Agents
           Lasalle and Gregorio.

328
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,972
             We need to speak to
           Mr. Mitchell, please.

329
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,274
   Oh, don't worry, he hasn't
      done anything wrong.

330
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,176
                  But we do need
                to speak to him.

331
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,144
 Of course. I'll let him know.

332
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,046
       Thank you kindly.

333
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,018
        Mr. Mitchell...

334
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,954
That's exactly the eye contact
I'm talking about.

335
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,890
Clear connection,
no doubt about it.

336
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,892
              I'm not doing this
             with you, Gregorio.

337
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,327
                The chemistry is
           immediately palpable,

338
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,030
            you can't fake that;
             even I can feel it.

339
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,502
If you don't go
for her, I will.

340
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,170
What?

341
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,972
           MITCHELL:
         <i> Are you sure?</i>

342
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,675
   I mean, I didn't even know
       that Jack was out.

343
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,978
        He hasn't tried
  to contact you, or call you?

344
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,179
                    No, nothing.

345
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,581
You really think
that he killed Karen Decker,

346
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,982
   just because she testified
          against him?

347
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,334
                     That's what
                    we're trying

348
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,685
to find out, Mr. Mitchell,
but if he did,

349
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,353
you could be in danger, too.

350
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:25,256
Yeah, we heard Gordon was
particularly upset with you

351
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,691
 for not getting him acquitted.

352
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,227
 I did everything that I could.

353
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,129
                 I even took the
                  case pro bono.

354
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,530
      I mean, I knew Jack.

355
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,098
  He was the streetcar driver

356
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,067
    who took me to work here
           every day.

357
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,201
       I didn't want him
    to get stuck with a PD,

358
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,003
  so I offered to defend him.

359
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,638
           So you haven't talked
         to him since the trial?

360
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,407
     I called him in prison
      to check up on him,

361
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,175
   but all he ever wanted me
to do was get the case reopened.

362
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,110
   Because he still believed
        he was innocent?

363
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,295
 He never stopped believing it.

364
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:48,479
Didn't change
the facts of the case,

365
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,049
  but Jack never really cared
          about facts.

366
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,017
            (sighs)

367
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,286
              Look, if anything,
                   Jack owes me.

368
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,088
    I got the D.A. to agree
     to a reduced sentence

369
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,323
 based on Jack's mental state.

370
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,692
   I mean, I saved his life.

371
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,126
   Why would he be after me?

372
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,695
     We're not sure he is,
         Mr. Mitchell,

373
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,230
    but we're gonna get you
    protection just in case.

374
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,133
           Is there anything you
     remember that might help us

375
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,070
                    find Gordon?
              Family or friends?

376
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,671
Well, we're especially concerned
       about anybody else

377
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,239
     Gordon might be after.

378
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,541
          We're putting together
                 a list, that...

379
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,743
        Uh, Todd Borger.

380
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,078
Friend of Jack's,
drove the night shift.

381
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
You need to protect him.

382
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,015
   The D.A. tripped Borger up
         on the stand,

383
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,249
   got him to admit that Jack

384
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,651
was violent, jealous.

385
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,753
          Between that
  and the coroner's testimony,

386
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,521
 the jury was ready to convict.

387
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,190
          Murder one.

388
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,126
             WADE:
       <i> There's no doubt,</i>

389
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,195
          Jack Gordon
 murdered Petty Officer Ortega.

390
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,663
    That is my professional
            opinion,

391
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,099
 and it is my personal opinion.

392
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,067
MITCHELL: Objection, Your Honor.
     Dr. Wade is qualified

393
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,235
   only for expert testimony.

394
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,402
JUDGE: Sustained.
Please, just answer...

395
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,205
         Court footage
      of the Ortega case?

396
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,441
    Yeah. Circa court 1997.

397
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:54,145
           Just saying, Dr. Wade
            looking mighty fine.

398
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,246
        And pissed, too.

399
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,448
 Yeah. Wasn't an ordinary case.

400
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,183
       Horrendous murder.

401
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,651
        Lot of emotions.

402
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:04,222
            Yeah, well, the good
  Dr. Wade's barely hiding hers.

403
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,324

       DISTRICT ATTORNEY:
 And you think the defendant's

406
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,461
mental illness could've made him

407
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,296
  capable of extreme violence?

408
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,698
      MITCHELL: Objection,
   she's not a psychologist.

409
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,200

I didn't kill her! I'm innocent!

      Forensics don't lie!
        I didn't do it!

411
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,070
  I didn't do it, and you know
        I didn't do it!

   WADE: The hell you didn't!
        (gavel banging)

417
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,347
  My behavior was inexcusable.

as I knew them.

Not give my opinion

      He pled out, he confessed.

But why?

431
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,719
     Was he really guilty,

432
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:13,091
  or did I sway the jury with
  something other than facts?

433
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,393
  Loretta, you've testified in
dozens of cases over the years.

434
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,662
Why are you beating yourself up

You know why, Dwayne.

436
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,265
 You saw the courtroom footage.

        I wasn't myself.

438
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,804
       And I've known it
     for a long time, too.

    We went to high school,
 joined the transit authority.

444

Back then, streetcars only used
     one driver both ways.

00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,399
                  Saw her pretty
                 much every day.

449
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,901
She and Jack were good together.

450
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,402
      Until he killed her.

451
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,371
 Still can't believe he did it.

452
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,240
         Meaning, what?
   You think he was innocent?

453
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,842
   At the time, yeah. I mean,
 I know how much he loved her.

454
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,411
         Jack struggled
  with paranoia and delusions

455
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,713
        his whole life.

456
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,249
      I thought he had it
         under control.

457
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,217
     Is that what the D.A.
    got you to say in court?

458
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,253
 Yeah. It helped send him away.

459
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,688
   Yeah, well, he's out now,
 and if he killed Karen Decker

460
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,891
        out of revenge,
 then you're not safe, either.

461
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,359
Is there any chance
you might help us figure out

462
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,261
     where Gordon might be?

463
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,329
I mean, the sooner we
get him off the streets,

464
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,432
   the sooner the people who
testified against him are safe.

465
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,301
       I think I saw Jack
         earlier today,

466
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,636
       across the street
       from the station.

467
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,304
         So, why didn't
      you call the police?

468
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,439
   I wasn't sure it was him.

469
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,475
     Besides, I didn't know
he'd just killed somebody else.

470
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,383
     (wind chime tinkling)

471
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,253
                  Uh, good news.
Mm-hmm.

472
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,489
   Christopher says everyone
 who testified against Gordon,

473
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,391
       (thunder rumbling)
        under police protection.

474
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,892
Apparently, so am I. Here.

475
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,260
                      (chuckles)

476
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,595
 Oh, by the way. I don't snore.

477
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,298
 At least, not that I know of,
            anymore.

478
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,432
         (both chuckle)

479
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,434
   I don't know if I do anymore.

480
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,736
     You think either of us will
         ever get married again?

481
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,439
Oh, I'm not in
any hurry, myself. You?

482
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,342
      If the right person
       came along, maybe.

483
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,345
   Last one kind of soured me
          on the idea.

484
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,447
Yeah. Long time ago, though.

485
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:21,319
Divorce happened just before
Gordon's case, didn't it?

486
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,354
That's the reason I moved here.

487
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,623
New beginnings and all.

488
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,425
        (water running)
      Yeah. A lot to go through.

489
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:33,497
         Gordon's case
  must've made it even harder.

490
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,433
       Where are we going
     with all this, Dwayne?

491
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,468
  Not going anywhere, just...

492
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,472
I know that your husband didn't
 treat you right, either, so...

493
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,641
  No, it isn't that he didn't
        treat me right.

494
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:47,378
 You know it. He froze me out.

495
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,980
   He wasn't like this at first,

496
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:53,251
          just started
     to resent my success.

497
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,685
Then it got even worse

498
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:58,756
   when they passed him over
   for others less qualified.

499
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,524
       Then he got mean.

500
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,561
     It took a long time to find
       the courage to leave him,

501
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,363
              but I finally did.

502
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,331
          I was lucky.

503
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,700
   Luckier than Janet Ortega.

504
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,469
          You were both victims.

505
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,537
  And they were both abusers.

506
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,439
But I was still

507
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:20,578
     so upset and so angry
 with how Reginald treated me,

508
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,914
that when I testify, I projected
     all that onto Gordon.

509
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,483
And...

510
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,918
          ever since,

511
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,522
   I've worried that I biased
     the jury against him.

512
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,625
      It doesn't change the fact
that the evidence against Gordon

513
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,560
               was overwhelming.

514
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,329
     Wasn't just your testimony.

515
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,431
But my testimony
made an impact.

516
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,533
I saw it in each

517
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,536
and every one of
the juror's faces.

518
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,474
I wasn't trying to make
Gordon pay.

519
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,344
I was trying to make
my husband pay.

520
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:57,915
And it's haunted me
ever since.

521
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,784
       (thunder rumbling)

522
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:08,693
                        Loretta.

523
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:10,361
                     Don't move,

524
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:12,530
and stay calm.

525
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,032
                           Okay?

526
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,468
            Gordon.
                         Mm-hmm.

527
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,403
Outside.

528
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:22,473
              Just wait a minute
                   and call 911.

529
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,375
                    I'm gonna go
               get this blanket,

530
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,710
pillows.

531
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:28,679
   Put them out on the sofa,
      I'll be right back.

532
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,686
       (thunder crashing)

533
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,624
                  Oh!

534
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,695
  (Pride and Gordon grunting)

535
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,766
          Get off me!
       Calm down, Gordon.

536
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:50,634
         Stop fighting.
             Relax.

537
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:51,802
             Relax.
           (grunting)

538
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:52,970
         Stop fighting.

539
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,605
  You're under arrest, Gordon,

540
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,140
for the murder of Karen Decker.

541
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,576
    I didn't do it. (groans)

542
00:22:58,578 --> 00:22:59,944
       (thunder crashing)

543
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,389
                 I didn't do it!

544
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,624
         The blood at the school
                      wasn't me!

545
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,793
   You just don't understand!

546
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,562
Help me understand,
Gordon,

547
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,732
what were you doing
outside Dr. Wade's house.

548
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,602
        I need my meds.
        Get me my meds!

549
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,037
        PRIDE: I'm getting them.
    The agitation you're feeling

550
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,507
right now is
clozapine withdrawal.

551
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,609
You're not
going anywhere.

552
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:32,643
Try and breathe.

553
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:33,911
Swallow.

554
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,479
          Who's there?

555
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,814
              Who's on the other
                 side of there?!

556
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,416
                There's somebody
                  looking at me!

557
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:39,650
                I know there is!

558
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,685
    Who's on the other side?

559
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:45,623
     Dr. Wade, is that you?

560
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,725
    I wasn't gonna hurt you,
            I swear.

561
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,527
        I just wanted your help!

562
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,561
             PRIDE:
          Talk to me.

563
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:51,862
          Gordon, look at me.
                    (sobs)

564
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,165
What do you mean when you say
you want her help?

565
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,699
For what, medication?

566
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:56,801
            No, no.

567
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:59,069
  I just want... I wanted her!

568
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,971
        (Gordon sobbing)

569
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,107
                  I need someone
                  to believe me!

570
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,977
      I didn't kill Janet!

571
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,846
           (crying):
        I swear to God.

572
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,915
      I didn't kill Janet!

573
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:18,155
        If Gordon didn't
       kill Janet Ortega,

574
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,758
                  he didn't kill
            Chief Decker either.

575
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,093
All right, slow down,
okay?

576
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,162
Just 'cause he claims he's
innocent, doesn't mean he is.

577
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,931
He's a desperate man.

578
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:30,167
 Yes, but he has been claiming
his innocence for over 20 years.

579
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:33,037
Guilty or not,
we have to be sure.

580
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,172
   Gonna give him his clozapine,

581
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,641
then talk again
after he settles down.

582
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,710
           We're gonna take this
             one step at a time,

583
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,212
just like we always do.

584
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:42,813
                   Maybe there's
             something I missed.

585
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:43,948
                 Or maybe it was
                  really because

586
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,716
                   I just wanted
               him to be guilty.

587
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:48,185
Loretta...
                         (sighs)

588
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:51,822
                I need to check,
              you need to check.

589
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,824
     Because if Jack Gordon
          is innocent,

590
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,594
              then the killer is
                still out there.

591
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,937
 You want one of us to stay with
      her, make sure she's safe?

592
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,806
She'll be okay.

593
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,542
Killer's either locked up
in our interrogation room,

594
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:12,977
           or out there thinking
              he's won the game.

595
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:15,012
        Killing again would just
          prove Gordon innocent.

596
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,881
You're not convinced Gordon's
our killer, are you?

597
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,516
         I'm convinced
     there's a possibility

598
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,817
    he's telling the truth,

599
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:20,851
      so we're gonna keep
         investigating.

600
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,720
Well, all due respect
to the doc,

601
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,121
but somebody would be going
through a lot of trouble

602
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,689
to set Gordon up twice

603
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,224
across a span of 20 years.

604
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,026
         I admit it's a stretch,

605
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,129
     but like Loretta says,
      we need to be sure.

606
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,831
           All right,
        what's the plan?

607
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,733
          Loretta's gonna review
           the forensic evidence

608
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:38,168
        on Janet Ortega, in case
            she missed anything.

609
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,070
       Gonna ask the D.A.
      to exhume the body.

610
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,839
     That means I need you
     to go to Morgan City,

611
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,908
                  pick it up and
           get it to the morgue.
          You got it.

612
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,076
             You and Patton need
            to comb through both

613
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,579
   Ortega's murder and Decker's.

614
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,814
             See if you can find
    a connection to anybody else

615
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:52,883
              other than Gordon.

616
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,785
          Pills, King.

617
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,120
If somebody had 20 years

618
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:57,821
to frame Gordon
for another murder,

619
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,623
chances are they didn't
make a mistake.

620
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,325
                But if they did,
             we need to find it.

621
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,160
             We need to be right
                     about this.

622
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,963
    Both for Gordon and Loretta.
Okay.

623
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,841
         Knock, knock.

624
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,844
     It's okay, Sebastian,
            come in.

625
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,880
       Okay, cool, I didn't want
             to scare you again.

626
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:24,014
              Kind of freaked me
                  out last time.

627
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,282
                 Not your fault,
                      obviously.

628
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,850
     It's just childhood issues.

629
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,652
         You know, jumpy mother.

630
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,020
           I'm thinking I should
             get into therapy...

631
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,122
          That for me?
                          It is.

632
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,158
                Yeah, I'm sorry.
                     Anyway, uh,

633
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,261
 the D.A. released Ortega's old
  case evidence from Property.

634
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,862
        What are we looking for?

635
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,731
     Frankly, I'm not sure,

636
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,700
     but I want to be sure
    I didn't miss something.

637
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:44,001
        I perused the case file.

638
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:45,135
          I don't think you did.

639
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,804
    I mean, every "I" is dotted,

640
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,272
    every "T" is crossed on your
              forensic findings.

641
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,774
  At least, you know, to my eye.

642
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,911
Can never be too certain.
There's too much at stake.

643
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:55,846
Meanwhile...

644
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,183
...you mind to take
a closer look at this?

645
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,885
          What is this, the hair
                sample you found

646
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,287
         on Chief Decker's body?

647
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,756
         I already identified it
                    as Gordon's.

648
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:08,058
Mm-hmm, but we need to know
if it fell from his person,

649
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,728
or if it was placed
on the victim by someone else.

650
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,895
    You think Gordon was set up?

651
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:15,299
Do a calcium carbonate test.
Let's find out.

652
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:32,282
          You can uncuff me now.
         I ain't gonna hurt you.

653
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:37,054
        Well... at least
    till the meds wear off.

654
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,072
           Thank you.

655
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:04,348
            (sighs):
         Jack Gordon...

656
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:09,019
          pled guilty to killing
      Janet Ortega 20 years ago.

657
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,255
      A week after your release,

658
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:13,023
                   a key witness
        against you was murdered

659
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,258
          in the exact same way.

660
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,893
            Why should I believe
                you're innocent?

661
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,928
          Because I am innocent.

662
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,897
          I never stopped trying
        to prove it, never will.

663
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,733
Why'd you call Chief Decker
the moment you were paroled?

664
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:24,968
    Because I needed her help to
      prove I didn't kill Janet.

665
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,938
                 I convinced her
                I wasn't guilty.

666
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,175
    So, somebody set you up
         20 years ago?

667
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:34,011
Somebody set you up yesterday--
  is that what you're saying?

668
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:36,046
                      I know how
               this looks, okay?

669
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,783
                 I'm a diagnosed
                  schizophrenic.

670
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:43,353
     But you have to understand,
                  I loved Janet.

671
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:46,790
 When she joined the Navy to get
   away, it nearly destroyed me.

672
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,259
The murder weapon,
the jackknife--

673
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,862
Jack's knife--
belonged to you.

674
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:53,931
         I gave Janet that knife
                 for protection.

675
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:55,899
                        From me.

676
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,002
           I got crazy at times.

677
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,138
  And I abused her when I wasn't
       in my right mind, I know.

678
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,107
         But that's why I wanted
                Janet to be able

679
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,175
     to protect herself in case.

680
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,144
            She had to leave me.

681
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:11,014
         I could never kill her,
                    Agent Pride.

682
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:13,383
          Same way I could never
              kill Karen Decker.

683
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,019
          Karen was the only one
             willing to help me.

684
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,122
                 Wh-Why would I?

685
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,758
So let's say I believe you.

686
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,226
Who set you up?

687
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:23,994
You must have some idea.

688
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:28,766
           All I know is someone
               else liked Janet,

689
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:30,167
      and they was pursuing her.

690
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,003
                    It had to be
              whoever killed her

691
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,404
   killed Karen Decker, too.

692
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,173
     And maybe they thought
          we was close

693
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,908
 to figuring out who they was.

694
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,976
          Close? How?

695
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,778
       What do you mean?

696
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,045
    The Innocence Project--
          they gave me

697
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,148
         my case files
     while I was in prison.

698
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,850
 Okay, I poured over the files,
   I didn't find anything...

699
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,787
          till I found
    this one photo of Janet.

700
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,088
            Last time I saw her,

701
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,157
 an hour before she was killed,

702
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,325
 she was wearing a necklace...

703
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,795
   with a purple gemstone...

704
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:00,097
     but it wasn't from me.

705
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,565
                So?
                    So it wasn't

706
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,233
on the body when she was found.

707
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,869
          And I looked
  at every crime scene photo,

708
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,004
            and it wasn't there.

709
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,972
        Killer took it.
                  'Cause he knew

710
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,574
         that it might
      connect back to him.

711
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:13,110
                 You could check
            the photos yourself,

712
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:15,012
   and you'll see I'm right.

713
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,882
  You'll see I didn't do this.

714
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,055
  (hissing, keyboard clacking,
          door opens)

715
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,557
WADE:
You find something?

716
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,392
            I think maybe, yeah.

717
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:31,562
 Gordon's hair had trace amounts
     of calcium carbonate on it.

718
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:33,297
   Transferred from the latex
     gloves the killer used

719
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,233
        to plant a hair
    on Chief Decker's body.
Yeah.

720
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,402
     Which means if Gordon
  didn't kill Chief Decker...

721
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,170
    he probably didn't kill
     Janet Ortega, either.

722
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,856
                Which also means

723
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:45,541
 an innocent man spent 20 years
     of his life in prison,

724
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,312
  and I helped send him there.

725
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:02,926
PRIDE:
Nothing else?
No other connections

726
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,995
to the other murders other
than how they were killed?

727
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,496
                  Nothing we can
                     find so far

728
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,465
          other than the obvious
           connection to Gordon.

729
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,167
It's too obvious
for my taste.

730
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:11,935
Too clean, too.

731
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:14,304
                        Yeah.
If Gordon didn't do it...

732
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,373
whoever did knew how
to cover their tracks.

733
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,575
GREGORIO:
Like someone in the Navy
or law enforcement--

734
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,577
but we checked
both victims' records,

735
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,880
nothing jumps out.
              Nothing to confirm

736
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,883
Gordon's claim of Janet Ortega's
mystery suitor?

737
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,651
          Nothing other than the
       purple gemstone necklace.

738
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,053
            However,
   the victim was wearing it

739
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,655
right before she got killed,
like Gordon said.

740
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:34,391
                  This is from a
             surveillance camera

741
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,160
        at the Decatur streetcar
        station that same night,

742
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,195
         20 years ago.

743
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:39,496
Except,

744
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:40,898
she wasn't wearing it

745
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,067
after she was killed,

746
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,135
     also like Gordon said.

747
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,603
Well, it makes sense,
right?

748
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,672
      Killer doesn't want
anybody tracing it back to him.

749
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,508
  You know what? I'm starting
 to think maybe Gordon's right,

750
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,143
somebody's setting him up.

751
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,212
        Especially since
        the more grisly

752
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:56,546
and violent the murders appear,

753
00:31:56,548 --> 00:32:00,050
the more a jury's
predisposed to believe

754
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:02,152
 that abuse and mental illness
      could be the cause.

755
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,520
               Problem is, other
            than Gordon's claim,

756
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,556
      we don't have much,
     if anything, to go on.

757
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,960
      But we find out who
gave Janet Ortega that necklace,

758
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,295
          and we will.

759
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:19,136
LASALLE: Took 'em longer
than they thought to dig it out,

760
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:20,671
that ground
was still pretty damp.

761
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,639
      Fortunately for us,
      burying the deceased

762
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,008
         in cemeteries
     near peatland marshes

763
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,477
     prevents putrefaction,
         decomposition.

764
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,313
SEBASTIAN: You really think
she can tell us something

765
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:30,314
      after all this time?

766
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:31,448
                  WADE: Time may
                heal all wounds,

767
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,583
dear, but not when you're dead.

768
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,152
                     Still, it's
                 hard to believe

769
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:37,187
             you, of all people,
               missed something.

770
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:41,491
           Yes, well,
  if Jack Gordon is innocent,

771
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,060
       then I must have.

772
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,729
I'm headed back to headquarters,

773
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,230
to help them find that necklace.

774
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,665
Keep me posted.

775
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,267
SEBASTIAN:
So these are

776
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,002
               Ortega's original
                 autopsy photos?
Yes, uh,

777
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,437
this is the one
of particular interest

778
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,572
of the back of her neck.

779
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,408
      SEBASTIAN: Oh, yeah,
     some kind of abrasion.

780
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,545
At the time, I noted it
as consistent with other wounds

781
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,380
likely inflicted
when she was dragged

782
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:04,614
to the car,

783
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,683
but after hearing
about the necklace...

784
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,452
           It could be the wound
         was caused when someone

785
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,686
         ripped it off her neck.

786
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,121
             If so,

787
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:14,057
  it could be what I missed...

788
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:17,094
    in my rush to judgment.

789
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:24,701
 Sebastian may have something.
           Go ahead.

790
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,603
                      SEBASTIAN:
                    Right, well,

791
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,206
we reexamined a cut on the back
     of Janet Ortega's neck

792
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,575
and we found microscopic slivers
          of platinum

793
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,276
   imbedded in what was left
         of the tissue.

794
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,278
      If the killer ripped
  the necklace off her neck...

795
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,381
Slivers might've gotten lodged
beneath the skin.

796
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:38,749
That narrows
our search.

797
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:41,151
           Big time,
since platinum is pretty pricey.

798
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,753
             Hey, how's Doc Wade
                     holding up?

799
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,788
         Oh, you know.

800
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,356
 She's still beating herself up
   pretty bad over all this.

801
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,557
                          PRIDE:
          Can't change the past.

802
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,625
But we can do
everything we can

803
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,327
      to make things right
        moving forward.

804
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,696
               We'll get back to
                 you, Sebastian.

805
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,097
Hey, I think I may have a lead.

806
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,667
I've been runnin' the necklace
from the Ortega photo

807
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,536
through imaging software,

808
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,705
  but I just narrowed it down
    to platinum pieces only

809
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,340
            and bam!

810
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:06,743
     Canal Street Boutique
       designed and sold

811
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,745
the very same platinum,
diamond and amethyst necklace

812
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,213
                        in 1997.

813
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,314
If we can track down
purchase receipts,

814
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:12,816
    we might be able to find
           a suspect

815
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:16,286
        who intersected
with Ortega's life 20 years ago.

816
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,722
            PATTON:
         Can't be many.

817
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:19,689
          4,500 large.

818
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,258
  That's some serious change.

819
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,759
LASALLE:
Check this out:

820
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,694
            the store is located

821
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,329
         at the end of
  the Decatur streetcar line.

822
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,167
                 That's the same
                     street line

823
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,102
   Janet Ortega took to work
           every day,

824
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,837
                with Jack Gordon
         driving in the morning.

825
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,506
LASALLE: And his buddy,
Todd Borger, driving at night.

826
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:37,774
         Could be a coincidence.

827
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,092
    but on the other hand...

828
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:40,409
If we connect Borger
to her necklace,

829
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,845
       we can connect him
         to her murder.

830
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:46,616
         Still, $4,500,

831
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,351
          pretty steep
  for a young streetcar driver

832
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,719
making, what, eight,

833
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,321
  ten bucks an hour back then?

834
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:52,789
         Not too steep
      for a young lawyer.

835
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,158
 Jewelry store is right next to

836
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,660
the office of Gordon's attorney.

837
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:57,828
     Right, Devon Mitchell.
    We were there yesterday.

838
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,763
               Which means what?

839
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,798
          Mitchell's the one who
       gave Ortega the necklace?

840
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,600
  Hold on, why would Mitchell
       kill Janet Ortega,

841
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:04,835
         frame Gordon,

842
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:06,470
      and then turn around
        and defend him?

843
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:08,472
  Pretty good way to make sure
     Gordon loses the case.

844
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:11,274
        And if Mitchell
   killed Chief Decker, too,

845
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,210
           make sure
    it didn't get reopened.

846
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,179
   We need to find Mitchell.

847
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,885
         (blow landing)

848
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:27,858
           Sebastian!

849
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,129
MITCHELL:
Should've just
let things be.

850
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,929
      All right, now what?

851
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,713
Now? Now, you're gonna
delete every piece of evidence

852
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:53,650
               from your server.

853
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,586
Why? You're just
gonna kill me anyway.

854
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,156
        Well, your lab tech back
    there didn't see me hit him,

855
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:01,258
          but I can always carve
              out his eyes, too.

856
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,793
Go.

857
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:10,267
              Jack went to Chief
                Decker for help,

858
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:12,335
and she came to you, didn't she?

859
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,304
     Just delete the files.

860
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,940
  Just out of curiosity, how'd
  you know I had any evidence?

861
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:18,909
                 D.A. called me,

862
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,944
        told me you were
     exhuming Janet's body.

863
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:23,313
           Hurry up.

864
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:24,748
      I forgot how chummy
         you two were.

865
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,316
 Surprised you didn't talk her

866
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:27,851
    into the death sentence
           for Jack.

867
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:31,288
      Yeah, well, the jury
   wouldn't buy premeditation

868
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,956
   because of his condition.

869
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,825
    Otherwise, I would have.

870
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,561
           So, what,

871
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:39,229
just because

872
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:41,264
   Janet wouldn't leave Jack
            for you,

873
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,433
     you kill an innocent woman,
              ruin a man's life,

874
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:45,402
        then kill again?

875
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:48,205
     Couldn't have done it
       without you, Doc.

876
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,974
  Your testimony against Jack
 really sealed the deal for me.

877
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:53,376
      Don't you dare blame
  what happened to Jack on me.

878
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,278
      This is all on you.
Yeah,

879
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
  well, unfortunately for you,

880
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,916
  you and I are the only ones
         who know that.

881
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,652
           Aren't we?

882
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:05,222
          (door opens)

883
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,223
                          PRIDE:
                        Loretta?

884
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:08,792
           (gunshots)

885
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,398
           (shouting)

886
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,733
          (screaming)

887
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,835
           (gunshots)

888
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,377
                  You all right?

889
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:30,780
               Huh? You good?
          (whimpering)

890
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:33,283
                   (Wade crying)

891
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,354
                   You did good.

892
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,458
           (sniffles)

893
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,699
           SEBASTIAN:
         <i> Please tell me</i>

894
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,334
             that getting my ass
             kicked all the time

895
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,802
             is just part of the
             whole newbie thing.

896
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,804
           'Cause if it's not, I
        am seriously considering

897
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,306
          going back to the lab.

898
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,708
           That or just buying a
        bunch of life insurance.

899
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,311
You did great, baby,
and you're doing great.

900
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:02,979
             Just hang in there.
             (chuckles)

901
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,881
     That's easy for her to say.

902
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,884
  Gregorio's been knocking heads
     and taking names for years.

903
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:10,287
                      SEBASTIAN:
  Yeah, she grew up in New York,
      you know? I'm from Peoria.

904
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,489
                      (chuckles)
   Here, knock 'em back, Peoria.

905
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,426
 How's Wade? Anyone talk to her
       yet this morning?

906
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,495
           Pride has.
He says she's doing much better.

907
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:20,563
 Yeah, 'cause she's kicking ass.
Oh, stop.

908
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,065
                         PATTON:
        Not better than Lasalle.

909
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:24,434
 I heard Lothario's got himself
       another hot date.

910
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:25,435
                    Oh, he's not

911
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:26,536
      a lothario anymore.

912
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,305
    Your boy's all grown-up.

913
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:29,773
 Besides, it's just breakfast.

914
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:32,709
        And, pray tell, how come
           you know all of this?

915
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:35,378
        Well, you know,
  been giving him a few tips.

916
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,580
             Unsolicited, maybe,
             but he's listening.

917
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,383
  Ah. Handy having a profiler
          on the team.

918
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,852
Not being cocky here, but
I think I pretty much identified

919
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,487
his perfect type.

920
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,090
Not quite sure how
to break it to him though.

921
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,425
          Why's that?
                          Tough,

922
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:50,994
loyal, whip-smart, sassy,

923
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:54,364
can hang with the boys,
and gives as good as she gets.

924
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,335
    Percy?
                       Percy?

925
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:01,705
  Like I said, not quite sure
    how to break it to him.

926
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,374
        Where you going?

927
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:06,409
I'm going to get me
some pills, too.

928
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:09,412
Just the thought of them
together makes my head hurt.

929
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:11,848
   (streetcar bell clanging)

930
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,551
   (bell continues clanging)

931
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:20,423
   Never got tired of driving
 a streetcar through the city.

932
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:23,393
       It's a great job.

933
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:25,795
       Loved every minute of it.

934
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:26,863
           (clacking)

935
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,531
           (whirring)

936
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,700
Might be able
to pull some strings,

937
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:34,003
      see if I can get you
      your-your job back.

938
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,740
You're a free man now, Jack.
Besides, the city and the state,

939
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:40,410
  they owe you more than that.
                          Still,

940
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:43,513
 it's a little scary being out
        all of a sudden,

941
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,382
                        cleared.

942
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,751
     I spent so many years
 trying to prove my innocence,

943
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:50,487
   I didn't think much about
  what I'd do if I succeeded.

944
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:54,724
Well, the-the halfway house
can help you adjust.

945
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,159
     So can I.

946
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,161
So can Dr. Wade.

947
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:01,831
          Is that why you wanted
          to meet, ride with me?

948
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:05,068
One of the reasons.

949
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,603
Look...

950
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,708
         ...you were right to...

951
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,911
             go to her for help.

952
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:18,481
               There's no reason
              to stop now, Jack.

953
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:21,451
         She feels bad
      about what happened,

954
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:23,420
    more than she deserves.

955
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:26,923
Bad? Hell, didn't she just help
         exonerate me?

956
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:31,494
 Anyway, I never held anything
          against her.

957
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:32,896
            I mean,
 she didn't do anything wrong.

958
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:34,964
       I... I hurt Janet.

959
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,500
      Got used against me.

960
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,636
    All she did was say it.

961
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,471
Actually,

962
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:43,606
she probably ended up
saving my life,

963
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,676
getting the jury to take pity
on me 'cause of my condition.

964
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:48,478
   Then maybe you'll be open
      to the other reason

965
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,612
    I wanted to talk to you.

966
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,015
               The good doctor's
                donated her time

967
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,717
        to the Innocence Project
             for a lot of years.

968
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,621
   Could use what you learned to
 help others wrongly imprisoned.

969
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,825
 Might give you some direction.

970
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:06,062
  Maybe... help the two of you
       heal a little bit.

971
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:09,799
          Interested?

972
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,970
        (bell clanging)

973
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,512
                       Storage?

974
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:24,747
    No. Trash.

975
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:27,517
I'm not gonna let the past
weigh me down any longer.

976
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,686
It's time to move on.

977
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:33,256
Unless you want me to bore you
with more talk of my ex-husband.

978
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:34,524
                I'm out of here.

979
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,826
   Mm, that's what I thought.

980
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,529
     (wind chime tinkling)

981
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,504
     (wind chime tinkling)

982
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,254
           Thank you.

983
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,758
           (chuckles)

984
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,562
   Would you like to come in
   for some tea, Mr. Gordon?

985
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,266
             Sure.
