  up and in your grill, baby.

60
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,516
       How can we still hear him
         if they swept his cell?

61
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,953
        You can't sweep
     a Triple P shadow app,

62
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:10,522
        which allows me
    to listen to and record

63
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,525
       any and everything
        within earshot.

64
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,561
      Problem is, anything
  and everything isn't covered

65
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,262
   under the wiretap warrant.

66
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,864
      Only what's related
         to Clearwater

67
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,233
         or his alleged
     offshore slush funds.

68
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,634
  And Javier Garcia's murder.

69
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,902
           HAMILTON:
         Let Jess know,

70
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,572
   uh, I won't be seeing her
          for a while.

71
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,408

about any more of these affairs.

  within the strict parameters

76
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,319
         of the order,
  it won't stand up in court.

77
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,621
     Mayor's dirty, Karen.

78
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,856
   Look, Rita's put together
  a solid circumstantial case,

79
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,726
      but Jenkins-- he was
 the only judge willing to risk

80
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,662
   going up against Hamilton
       to grant the tap.

81
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,664
I know how bad
you want to take him down,

82
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,499
but if you don't
do this by the book,

83
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,934
you're gonna
blow the wiretap.

84
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,936
          And Hamilton
     gets away with murder.

85
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,239
      And everything else.

00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,675

                  Ah, all right,
                   I got a case.

90
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,482
      Keep monitoring the mayor.

91
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,851
   Are you sure Patton knows
  what keywords to listen for?

92
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,553
Is he read in
on Clearwater,

93
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,854
         every detail?

94
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,990
      No, not everything.

95
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:20,425
       Then I'd stay put
         if I were you.

96
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,594
   May only get this one shot

I can see that.

132
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,682
Heist crew were pros,

133
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,484
took out cameras,
jammed communication,

134
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,753
knew exactly what they were
after and where to get it.

135
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,555

136
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,557
             Couple hundred MP5s
           headed to Fort Bragg.

137
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,025
                The Navy's still

139
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,396
      SONJA: That's a lot
     of serious firepower.

140
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,598
    I mean, this can't just
     be about selling them

141
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,133
      on the black market.

142
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,835
       We're dealing with
     some kind of militia?

143
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,770
           Well, whoever it was,
             they came prepared.

144
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,573
According to the railway cops,
they all had body armor,

145
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,641
were using AR-15s,
concussive grenades.

146
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,009
How many were injured?

147
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,529
    That's the thing-- none.

148
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,048

    using AR-15s, grenades,

149
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,818
     making off with MP5s,
     and no cop gets shot?

150
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,087
   Oh, no, cops were shot all
 right, just not with bullets.

151
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,455
 Yeah, not with lethal rounds.

152
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,857
      With rubber bullets.

153
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,024

    packs a heck of a punch,

155
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,961
       especially coming
        out of an AR-15.

156
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,963
    It's more than enough to
   knock the wind out of you.

157
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,031
         But not kill.
GREGORIO:
Which begs the question,

158
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,134
 what kind of heist crew steals
   hundreds of lethal weapons

159
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,835
    using nonlethal rounds?

160
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,070
   Yeah. Doesn't make sense.

161
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,605
    Yeah, well, fortunately
         the rail cops

162
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,106
     were using live ammo.

163
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,943
  They tagged one of the crew.

164
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,944
 Lost a lot of blood. I should
   be able to get a DNA I.D.

165
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,614
     All right, let us know
   what you find, Sebastian.

166
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,549
       Who's the fat cat?

167
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,619
            Owner of the company
            that makes the guns,

168
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,920
                Justus Bancroft.

169
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,522
Or the victim.

170
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,024
       Whoa. Spent a lot
        of years at ATF

171
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,760
        seeing the pain
      Bancroft guns cause.

172
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,829
  Hardly makes them a victim.

173
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,199
                      Excuse me.

174
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:17,636
  NCIS. Mind if I get a word?

175
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,771
   Sorry, is there a problem?

176
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,907
    No, no, no, not at all.

177
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,475
   It's just that, uh, well,

178
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,177
   we already told the police
      everything we know.

179
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,878
       And we have to go.

180
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,114
    I'm sorry, who are you?

181
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,582
            Nadine.

182
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,883
           Bancroft.

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,921
     Special Agent Lasalle.

184
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,089
We'll talk with NOPD afterwards,
    but if you don't mind...

185
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,893
 No, no, of course, of course.
        Ask me anything.

186
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,929
Well, it's just that,
uh, we're hosting

187
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,730
our annual charity
event tomorrow.

188
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:49,601
I kind of think a couple hundred
    missing submachine guns

189
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,736
   trumps your little party,
           don't you?

190
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:52,704
             Percy.

191
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,740
    No disrespect, but, uh,

192
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,243
     we got to do our jobs,
   and that's a lot of guns.

193
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,845
  Oh, yeah, trust me, I know.

194
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,880
    It's not the first time
    we've been hit, either.

195
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,148
   You've been robbed before?

196
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,817
   Well, not to this extent,
            but yes.

197
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,853
       Uh, the FBI, ATF,
     they both investigated

198
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,222
      the other two times,
    and, uh, come up empty.

199
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,691
       I'm just glad none
    of the police got hurt.

200
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,227
       Well, third time, there's
         got to be a connection.

201
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,729
           We'll dig into it and
      let you know what we find.

202
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,264
           All right.
              We'll be in touch.

203
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,199
   You, uh, call me anytime.

204
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,934
                      Thank you.
           All right.

205
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:23,969
            Thanks.

206
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,206
                        LASALLE:
              I don't think King

207
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,609
      would've much liked
   the way you talked to her.

208
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,111
    Don't much like the way
       you talked to me.

209
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,679
             She acted like this
                was nothing more

210
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,015
     than an inconvenience.

211
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,783
    That didn't bother you?

212
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,886
                   Oh, I forgot,

213
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:43,522
                       nothing's
                  bothering you.

214
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,823
                          Right.

215
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,963
    Making yourself at home
          at my desk?

216
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,265
     Oh, Pride, no, no, no.
           I'm sorry.

217
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,866
    I just, I didn't want to

218
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,234
          bother you and Patton.
           It's okay, Sebastian.

219
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,036
    Just teasing. Sit down.

220
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,306
Be more than happy to trade
places with you, believe me.

221
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,174
          Sitting on a wiretap's
            kind of boring, huh?

222
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,676
More like tedious.

223
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,144
Plus, I'm learning
more about Hamilton

224
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,880
than I ever wanted to know.
A lot more.

225
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,816
   But nothing that connects him
   to the murders or Clearwater?

226
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,318
            Not yet.

227
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,319
                   But it's just

228
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,787
       a matter of time.

229
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,255
   Where are you on the case?

230
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,125
           Well, using the DNA I
       found at the crime scene,

231
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,960
       I'm trying to I.D.
      our wounded bad guy,

232
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,228
but nothing's coming up so far,

233
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,696
      which is, you know,
         a little odd.

234
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,264
     Okay. But not unusual.

235
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,966
I just got off
the phone with FBI,

236
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,834
  checked on the prior heists,
 and they got nothing, either.

237
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,703
                    Well, that's
                hard to believe.

238
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,305
              Three high-profile
              hits, no evidence.

239
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,839
            How's that possible?

240
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,308
Even stranger, none of
the past stolen guns

241
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,909
have showed up on
the street or black market.

242
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,210
It's as if they
just disappeared.

243
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,213
      Yeah, maybe I should
         get involved.

244
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,548
       No, Hamilton knows
       you're after him.

245
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,882
     You can't let up now.
      It's too important.

246
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,851
     So is a couple hundred
         missing guns.

247
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,853
                 Oh, no wonder I
             didn't get a match.

248
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:52,090
  I programmed the I.D. search
  for bad guys, not bad girls.

249
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,024
That's male bias,
by the way.

250
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,192
     I apologize for that.

251
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,928
   Uh, Josephine Bellacroix.

252
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,263
       First Lieutenant,
      born in New Orleans.

253
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,264
                       GREGORIO:
                       A Marine?

254
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,699
  Yeah, flawless record, too.

255
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,668
         She did a tour
     in Somalia and Sudan.

256
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,203
   Left the Corps a year ago.

257
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,238
  Just before the first heist.

258
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,207
      Wonder what made her
      start stealing guns.

259
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,343
     Pick her up, find out.

260
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:12,677
And before you do that...
 All right, I'll call Lasalle.

261
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,112
        He and Sonja are
      still in the field.

262
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,348
        Sebastian, start looking
           for known associates,

263
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,316
     see if we can find out
    who she's working with.
           I'm on it.

264
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,818
              Hey.

265
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,387
          We got this.
     Don't worry about us.

266
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,034
If you're gonna keep giving me
the silent treatment

267
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,369
and being mean to me...

268
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:38,970
                   I'm not being
                    mean to you.

269
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,239
Okay, so what's your problem?

270
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,742
I don't understand.

271
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,944
            I was just surprised
                   this morning,

272
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:48,346
        seeing you with that guy
             at the coffee shop.

273
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,282
Wait, Tom?

274
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,118
               I didn't know you
            were dating anybody.

275
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,353
I'm not dating anybody.

276
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,955
      It was just coffee.

277
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,723
Besides, I barely know that guy.

278
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,725
       Well, you knew him
    well enough to kiss him.

279
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,261
I didn't kiss--
he kissed me.

280
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,966
        Are you jealous?

281
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,701
                        (scoffs)
                        Jealous.

282
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,436
You're jealous.
          You're trippin', girl.

283
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,938
         Come on. Let's gear up.

284
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:24,749
        (lockbox beeps)

285
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,087
       Shotguns? Really?

286
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,755
     Yeah, wounded Marine.

287
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,358
      She's probably armed
       with a MP5 by now.

288
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,160
    Better safe than sorry.

289
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,428
          (gun clicks)

290
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,065
Federal agents!

291
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,738
             Percy.

292
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,448
   SONJA: No way that's just
    from the heist shooting.

293
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,929
House across the street
has a security camera,

294
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,464
            but it's a bad angle
                  to I.D. anyone

295
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,766
going in and out
of Bellacroix's place.

296
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,769
   Ooh, so no one walking out
          with an MP5?

297
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,004
   Lady carrying a small bag.
        That's about it.

298
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,272
             SONJA: It's looking
              more and more like

299
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,108
           the crew took her out
          to cover their tracks.

300
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,044
Takes a pretty vicious crew
to take out one of their own.

301
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,378
We need to find out
who they are

302
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,347
         so we can get
     those guns back, fast.

303
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,416
The problem is, they're so good
   at covering their tracks,

304
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,118
         we got squat.

305
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,421
 Yeah. If we could just figure
out what made a decorated Marine

306
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,490
       join a heist crew
      in the first place.

307
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:40,425
          Are you sure
  there weren't any red flags

308
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,793
     in her service record?

309
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,862
    No PTSD, no psych alarm.

310
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,798
Any of her known associates
with criminal backgrounds?

311
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,201
No. Bellacroix's a NOLA native,
  LSU grad, top of her class.

312
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,970
             Like I said, squat.

313
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:55,874
  Look, I know the Hamilton wire
    is important and everything,

314
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,076
   but think maybe it's time
       to loop Pride in?

315
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,446
King's expecting us
to find leads.

316
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,916
      Let's keep digging.

317
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,285
GREGORIO: All right.
            (sighs)

318
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,789
      (video call ringing)

319
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,257
           SEBASTIAN:
           Hey, guys.

320
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,159
     Oh, man, it's so weird
        being back here

321
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,662
   and seeing you guys there.

322
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,164
It's like, "Just when I thought
   I was out, they pulled..."

323
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,499
     It's Michael Corleone,
from, uh, from<i> The Godfather 3.</i>

324
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,938
      Guys, I think my...
        my screen froze.

325
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,473
     LASALLE: Ballistics on
      the victim, please.

326
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,841
          Right, sure.

327
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,910
    Well, the bullet pattern
       on our dead Marine

328
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,412
  suggests that all 13 bullets
       came from an MP5.

329
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,414
     Which, if you ask me,
        that's overkill.

330
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,583
  Even more reason to suspect
     her crew took her out.

331
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,268
Still, something doesn't add up.

332
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,952
   They went out of their way
     to use rubber bullets

333
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,254
         for the heist,
   but then use real bullets

334
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,206
   to kill one of their own?

335
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,157
  Maybe they knew killing cops
     guarantees the needle.

336
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,128
 Yeah, but if any of those guns
  end up as the murder weapon,

337
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,362
 they'll get the needle anyway.

338
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,164
    We're missing something.

339
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,166
Hey, did you get anything
on those rubber bullets yet?

340
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,167
        (computer beeps)

341
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,502
             WADE:
     You wanted me to call

342
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,004
     as soon as the autopsy
         was completed.

343
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,372
        Whoa. Hey, Doc.

344
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,241
       This is so crazy,
      it's like old times.

345
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,243
       You, me, plasmas.

346
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,611
     I didn't know you were
    in your lab, Sebastian.

347
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,179
 Why didn't you say something?

348
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,215
    SEBASTIAN: Well, I know
   better than to bother you

349
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,116
when you're elbow deep in liver.

350
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,218
      I hate to interrupt.

351
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,286
    Autopsy results, right.

352
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,421
      Okay, no surprises.

353
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:19,424
C.O.D.: multiple gunshot wounds.

354
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:23,161
     The bullets hit every
    major artery and organ,

355
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,963
      and any one of them
       would've sufficed.

356
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:28,433
       This was obviously
      a statement killing.

357
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,169
        One way to keep the rest
            of the crew in line.

358
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,937
                  However, there
                  is an anomaly.

359
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,240
     Before Ms. Bellacroix
         was murdered,

360
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:38,142
        someone sutured
   the initial gunshot wound

361
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,011
inflicted by the railway officer

362
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,246
       during the heist.

363
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,014
    Even removed the bullet.

364
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,251
Wait, why would they try
to save her only to kill her?

365
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,619
  That doesn't make any sense.

366
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,355
 Especially when you factor in
       that they gave her

367
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:54,359
   broad-spectrum prophylaxis
      to fight infection.

368
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,261
           SEBASTIAN:
    Bullet removal, sutures,

369
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,395
         antibiotics--
      I mean, this has to

370
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,197
         have been done
      by a doctor, right?

371
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,398
LASALLE:
Maybe.

372
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
But she didn't go to a hospital.

373
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:05,036
     The lady with the bag.

374
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,337
        WADE: Sebastian,
    did you tell them about

375
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,572
    the rubber bullets yet?

376
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,340
           SEBASTIAN:
          No, not yet.

377
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,375
   So, um, police everywhere
           have been

378
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,409
  looking to use more and more

379
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,677
        nonlethal ammo.

380
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,412
     It's been a real boon
     for gun manufacturers.

381
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,482
   Fortunately, each company
   that makes rubber bullets

382
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,951
          uses its own
    proprietary design, so,

383
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,687
      the bullets used by
         the heist crew

384
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,923
 are actually Bancroft bullets.

385
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:28,226
     Bancroft bullets used
    to steal Bancroft guns?

386
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,361
    I might've found another
      Bancroft connection.

387
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,497
Sorry, Doc, I need
the screen for another doc.

388
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:36,034
Emma Miller, a Doctors
Without Borders physician,

389
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,268
    also Bellacroix's doctor
           of record.

390
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,237
        They grew up in
      New Orleans together

391
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,506
       and graduated LSU
       at the same time.

392
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,042
  Which makes sense Bellacroix
   would call a doctor friend

393
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,377
        to stitch her up
    without ratting her out.
Mm-hmm.

394
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,514
Yeah, we need to find Dr. Miller
  and see what she has to say.

395
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,115
What's the Bancroft connection?

396
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,984
           A big one.
  Dr. Miller sits on the board

397
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,954
     of the Bancroft Family
   Foundation of New Orleans.

398
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,690
Which means that she could be at
that charity shindig right now.

399
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,625
  SEBASTIAN: Bancroft bullets,
       guns and friends.

400
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,461
         You guys think
     this is an inside job?

401
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,165
 Only way to find out is for us
  to crash their little party.

402
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,266
LASALLE:
Hold on.

403
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,301

     We can't just show up

     Well, sure, of course.
       She helped set up.

What's she got to do with this?

00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,474
You got it.

453
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,376
                  NADINE: Daddy,
                what's going on?

454
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,944
                   BANCROFT: Oh,
         nothing to worry about,

455
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,511
Nadine, honey, they're
just looking for Emma.

456
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,414
Have you seen her?

457
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,417
     Yeah, she's here somewhere,
    but can't you do this later?

458
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,718
                          PRIDE:
                     Afraid not.

459
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,487
How well do you know Dr. Miller?

460
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,089
                      She's like
                 a sister to me.

461
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,490
We've been friends for forever.

462
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,492
            LASALLE:
    Pride, we got a problem.

463
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,260
  We're behind the fountains.

464
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,162
   Come take a look at this.

465
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:19,697
      ♪ Baby, I don't like
          to wait... ♪

466
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,866
What is it, Chris?

467
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:24,602
   LASALLE: Caterer came back
  here to get more champagne.

468
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,610
          Emma Miller.

469
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,581
Executed, just like Bellacroix.

470
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,418
     Looks like it happened
      a couple hours ago.

471
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,553
Maybe even before
the party started.

472
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,359
     Well, we just got back
    from Dr. Miller's house.

473
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,629
Found body armor, a balaclava
and night vision goggles.

474
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,432
So, unless she liked
performing surgery in the dark

475
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,901
and under enemy fire, I'd say
she was part of the heist crew.

476
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,437
     Two women on the crew?
        That's unusual.

477
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,305
Yeah, but if it's true,
it doesn't make sense

478
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,608
that the crew's trying
to cover their tracks now.

479
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,610
         It's got to be
 somebody else targeting them.

480
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,896
    Like what, a rival crew?

481
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,181
     Trying to get the guns
   for themselves, possibly.

482
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:13,351
 Could be a black market buyer
     double-crossing them.

483
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,520
  You find any rubber bullets
       at Miller's house?

484
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:18,589
 Yeah, several boxes, actually.
 All of them made by Bancroft.

485
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,591
   Bancroft's name just keeps
    popping up, doesn't it?

486
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,760
PATTON: Popping up in
more places than you think.

487
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,229
          You need to hear this,
                      but hurry.

488
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,931
           BANCROFT:
      <i> You need to get NCIS</i>

489
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,233
  off my back, you understand?

490
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,270
I can't have them investigating
      those missing guns,

491
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,838
                  not now.
What does that mean?

492
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,306
You know where they are?

493
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,574
Mayor Hamilton?

494
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,576
PATTON: Hamilton was on
the phone just starting

495
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,579
    to talk about Clearwater
when Bancroft bulled his way in.

496
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:42,680
                            Shh.
   HAMILTON: But I got enough

497
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,215
 of my own problems with NCIS.

498
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,483
   There's nothing I can do.

499
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,485
You can use
your connections.

500
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,487
                      (chuckles)
Go over their heads.

501
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:52,557
Say you'll get the guns back
on your own. Be a hero.

502
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,493
  Yeah, and how am I supposed to
    get those guns back exactly?

503
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,328
     You leave that to me.

504
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,699
     Wasn't anything to do
        with Clearwater,

505
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,435
     but I thought I should
       record it anyway.

506
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,537
          Can't believe Bancroft
             stole his own guns.

507
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,472
Yeah, question is: why?

508
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,274
Company's doing
great financially,

509
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,909
doesn't need
the insurance payoff.

510
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,445
    Doesn't matter, we can't use
      what we just heard anyway.

511
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,746
Scope of the wiretap

512
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,782
            is only for Hamilton
                 and Clearwater.

513
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,584
Well, we can't
just ignore it.

514
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,786
Man all but
incriminated himself.

515
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,255
       Why don't you just
 bring Bancroft in, scare him?

516
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,523
   And let the lawyers argue

517
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,291
         whether it was
    admissible or not later.

518
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,493
     Because then Bancroft would
         find out about the tap,

519
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,295
                  which means so
                 would Hamilton.

520
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,764
     And then it would blow your
   one chance to bring him down.

521
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,667
        Yeah, on the other hand,
     two people are already dead

522
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,502
     'cause of those guns.

523
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,005
  How many more are gonna die
    before we get them back?

524
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,740
   So what are you gonna do?

525
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,920
    You're making a mistake.

526
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,566
It's a big risk, Pride.
Just saying.

527
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,535
Hope we don't lose
Hamilton over it.

528
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,770
                        Me, too.

529
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,455
Got to say,
I'm a little surprised.

530
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,324
Man of your means--

531
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:35,893
  would've thought you'd have
   asked for a lawyer by now.

532
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,829
                   I'm innocent.
          I don't need a lawyer.

533
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,965
 Well, innocent men don't tend
   to incriminate themselves,

534
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,833
         Mr. Bancroft.

535
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,936
How else do you think I would've
   gotten an arrest warrant?

536
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,938
           BANCROFT:
   I don't know, you tell me.

537
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,008
PRIDE:
Patton?

538
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,376
           HAMILTON:
         (laughs) Yeah.

539
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,678
      I'm sorry, Bancroft,

540
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,513
      but I got enough of
   my own problems with NCIS.

541
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:56,747
   There's nothing I can do.

542
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,582
           BANCROFT:
 You can use your connections,

543
00:21:58,584 --> 00:21:59,917
      go over their heads.

544
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,854
  Say you'll get the guns back
    on your own. Be a hero.

545
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,957
           HAMILTON:
  Yeah, and how am I supposed
to get those guns back exactly?

546
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,060
           BANCROFT:
     You leave that to me.

547
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,863
Doesn't sound
so innocent to me.

548
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,599
 That is taken out of context.

549
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,868
  Besides, how'd you get that?

550
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,938
      You put a tap on me?
        On what grounds?

551
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,641
       Tap wasn't on you.
      It was on the mayor.

552
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,810
You just got help
from the wrong person,

553
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,795
          got caught.

554
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:29,779
I don't give a damn
why you stole your own guns.

555
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,950
I just want to get 'em back
before anybody else gets killed.

556
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,752
      I didn't steal them.

557
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,887
      Then why do you know
      where the guns are?

558
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,457
   How come you told Hamilton
     you can get 'em back?

559
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:45,596
   Unless you start talking,
U.S. attorney's gonna charge you

560
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:48,032
      as a coconspirator,
         felony murder.

561
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,136
    You don't want to spend
the rest of your life in prison,

562
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,538
         talk... fast.

563
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,743
            I can't.

564
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,013
        (knock on door)

565
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,015
 Sorry, Pride, but Izzo's here.

566
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,418
 She insists on talking to you.

567
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,121
 IZZO:<i> Do you realize how many</i>
  <i> hoops I had to jump through</i>

568
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:12,757
just to get that wiretap granted
      in the first place?

569
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,024
I know, Karen, but I had...

570
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,060
                No buts, Dwayne.

571
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,597
         You based the arrest of
 Bancroft on Hamilton's wiretap.

572
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,999
         A good defense attorney
    will get that kicked easily.

573
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,868
Well, Bancroft
incriminated himself.

574
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,869
   What was I supposed to do?

575
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,036
  You were supposed to ignore

576
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,905
  what you heard, that's what.

577
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,508
   Too many guns are missing.
    I had to make a choice.

578
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,543
    A choice that's probably
         gonna cost you

579
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,545
         any chance of
    bringing down Hamilton.

580
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:37,581
            He's gonna find out,
           if he hasn't already.

581
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,049
  I'll worry about that later.

582
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,185
                 No, you need to
           worry about that now.

583
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:45,523
   Dwayne, if Mayor Hamilton
 is as dirty as you say he is,

584
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,857
    he's going to retaliate.

585
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,159
       You know he will.

586
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:50,728
       I wasn't gonna let
    more people get killed.

587
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,062
    You should've called me!

588
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,532
      I didn't have time,
         I had to act.

589
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,000
         I warned you.

590
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:57,535
  I warned you about the risk

591
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,603
 of going after a powerful man
         like Hamilton,

592
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,072
    about blowing the wire.

593
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,608
        You have no idea
       what you've done.

594
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:20,090
 Well, she doesn't seem happy.

595
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,026
           She's not.

596
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,727
    But let's stay on point.

597
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:28,032
    Bancroft's not talking,
    and I think I know why.

598
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:30,968
 I don't know how he's involved
     with the stolen guns,

599
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,670
    but there's no question
           in my mind

600
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:33,971
 that he knows where they are.

601
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,140
But he still wouldn't tell you?
                           Nope.

602
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,909
    And I think it's because
   he's protecting somebody,

603
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,479
     somebody he's willing
       to go to jail for.

604
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,647
         His daughter.

605
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,149
                          SONJA:
                  How can Nadine

606
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,667
 possibly be involved in this?

607
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:48,184
     SEBASTIAN: Well, she may be
   more involved than you think.

608
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:51,755
        I just ran case
      and victim profiles

609
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,557
through advanced link
and social network analysis;

610
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,025
guess whose name
lit up the scoreboard.

611
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,827
(Sonja scoffs)
Nadine Bancroft.

612
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,729
    She connects to the case
    on several levels, too:

613
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:02,066
 geographic, socioeconomic, age,
          schools, social media.

614
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,601
I mean,
all were bridesmaids

615
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:05,002
                  at three other
              friends' weddings.

616
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,270
    Doctors Without Borders,
            Marines,

617
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,072
 Nadine joined the Peace Corps.

618
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:11,275
   I mean, these are hardly just
     a bunch of rich debutantes.

619
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,511
   Could explain why nobody's
  been able to catch the crew.

620
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,279
       Nobody would ever
     suspect them, plus...

621
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,615
   Nadine would know exactly
     how to steal the guns

622
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:18,816
    without getting caught.

623
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:21,118
       Are you seriously
        suggesting that

624
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,687
        Nadine Bancroft
   is part of the heist crew?

625
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,624
    That she stole the guns
   from her own family? Why?

626
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,793
Don't know, but if her father
found out what she was doing,

627
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:32,196
makes sense
he's trying to protect her.

628
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,765
And that's why he told Hamilton
  he'd get him back the guns.

629
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,701
  So, what, Silver Spoon here
    is vying for attention?

630
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,237
       Rebelling against
how rich they are or something?

631
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,706
 Nah, there's got to be another
 reason why they're doing this.

632
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,276
       Yeah, it's a lot of guns,
            whatever the reason.

633
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:47,211
 Problem is, we're never gonna
  figure out who's killing off

634
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,946
         the heist crew
   unless we figure out why.

635
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:53,083
   Which means, they could be
       after Nadine next.

636
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,686
          Alert NOPD.

637
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,755
 Get 'em out to the Bancrofts'.

638
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:58,856
Let's go.

639
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:06,964
     PRIDE:<i> We're on scene,</i>
     <i> Christopher. Stand by.</i>

640
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:10,034
            LASALLE:
 Copy that. Any sign of Nadine?

641
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,168
           GREGORIO:
          <i> No, not yet.</i>

642
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,271
PRIDE:
Shots fired!

643
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:18,576
           GREGORIO:
  <i> I think they've got Nadine!</i>

644
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,810
   PRIDE:<i> We're in pursuit! </i>
        (siren wailing)

645
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:20,878
They're coming your way!

646
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,112
          Box 'em in!

647
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,614
            LASALLE:
      <i> We're almost there.</i>

648
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,649
        (siren wailing)

649
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,785
     SONJA:<i> Here they come!</i>
       <i> We got 'em, Pride!</i>

650
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:32,356
            (grunts)

651
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,126
            (grunts)

652
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,631
         Drop, Nadine!

653
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:43,968
            (grunts)

654
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,844
           (panting)
                    You're okay.

655
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,648
   You're okay. You're okay.

656
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:15,833
PRIDE: Hate to rush you,
Loretta, but...

657
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:18,135
please tell me
you can help us identify...

658
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,403
             They're Boko Haram.

659
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,806
At least, that's the particular
        terrorist group

660
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,208
 these two gunmen belonged to.

661
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,910
   Boko Haram in New Orleans?

662
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,245
         Are you sure?

663
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,047
      Unfortunately, I am.

664
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:33,183
      Notice the scarring
     from forehead to nose,

665
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,653
             the two rectilinear
          lines down the cheeks.

666
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,187
         Tribal scars.

667
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:41,358
 Many African ethnic groups use
 distinctive facial markings--

668
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,430
     Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa--
   but these men are Kanuri.

669
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:49,299
Heavily recruited by Boko Haram.

670
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,301
     I couldn't believe it
          myself until

671
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:55,005
    I saw the keloid tattoo
        on their ankles.

672
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,907
"BH."

673
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,942
     You know how much time
           I've spent

674
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,377
volunteering in Africa, Dwayne.

675
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,680
I've witnessed firsthand

676
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,114
          the horrors
    these animals perpetrate

677
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,416
on innocent women and children.

678
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:07,418
        I know, Loretta.

679
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,386
We're gonna do everything we can
         to stop them.

680
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,688
                    SONJA: Yeah,
                the question is:

681
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,690
what are they doing here?

682
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,192
And why are they killing
the heist crew?

683
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,394
    They must want the guns.

684
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,463
           But still, how'd they
        know Nadine and her crew

685
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:21,331
            were gonna steal the
        guns in the first place?

686
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,700
I don't know.

687
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,334
Maybe Nadine
could tell us.

688
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,704
 Let the rest of the team know
      we're heading back.

689
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,272
Have Gregorio

690
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:30,340
       alert DHS and FBI.

691
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:33,110
Doubt these are the only
two members of the hit squad,

692
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:35,979
which means we could use a lot
of help finding the others.

693
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,448
             On it.

694
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,486
Must've taken Nadine
instead of killing her

695
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:45,723
in hopes that she would tell 'em
where the guns were hidden.

696
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,792
                     No doubt by
                  torturing her.

697
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:49,960
       What do you mean?

698
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:51,428
                From the Marine.

699
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,199
                 Torn ligaments,
            antemortem bruising.

700
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,234
                 I didn't see it
                  in the prelim,

701
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,870
              but the poor woman
            was clearly tortured

702
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,505
    before she was executed.

703
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:04,408
      They would've gotten
everything they wanted from her.

704
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,877
                         Dwayne,

705
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:09,046
       you've got to get
        these bastards.

706
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:11,014
        But be careful.

707
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:19,289
              You saved my life,
               and I'm grateful.

708
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,425
      But I can't tell you
      where the guns are.

709
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,494
                  SONJA: Okay, I
               don't understand.

710
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:26,296
You stole
your father's guns.

711
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:28,398
             Two of your friends
                    were killed,

712
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,167
you were nearly killed,

713
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,337
and you won't
cooperate with us?

714
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,539
            (scoffs)
   Who do you think you are?

715
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,142
        Doesn't matter,
     you won't believe me.

716
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,544
Try me.

717
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:46,350
        Emma and I visited Jo in
    Sudan a couple of years ago.

718
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,285
                We were shocked.

719
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,420
      It couldn't have been more
           different than here--

720
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:54,124
       war-torn, famine.

721
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,094
                      Place is a
          humanitarian disaster.

722
00:29:57,096 --> 00:30:00,297
     We volunteered to help
        villagers set up

723
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,499
                 a girls' school
                    in Khartoum,

724
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,868
 but then Boko Haram attacked.

725
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,470
                 We were whisked

726
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,540
        into the embassy
       for safety, but...

727
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:13,877
   we watched the attack keep
  happening through the gates.

728
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,514
  And nobody tried to stop it.

729
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:21,552
Women being raped,

730
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:23,587
      children being shot.

731
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,291
     And there was nothing
          we could do.

732
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,095
      You don't ever unsee
      something like that.

733
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:38,101
  Guns are for the villagers.

734
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,138
     To protect themselves.

735
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,973
    'Cause nobody else will.

736
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,342
                  But Boko Haram
               must've found out

737
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,510
     what we've been doing,

738
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,312
       so they came here
      to try and stop us.

739
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,581
PRIDE:
It's a noble cause,

740
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:54,151
         but it's-it's
      completely illegal.

741
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,386
         Stealing guns,

742
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,890
         smuggling them
     out of the country...

743
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:03,594
    breaks 15 federal laws,
         you know that.

744
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,932
 You're really willing to risk
your life for this, aren't you?

745
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,134
                      Yes, I am.

746
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,472
                    If you don't
                      let me go,

747
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,474
get the villagers those guns...

748
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:20,510
         ...Boko Haram
    will keep attacking them

749
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,246
    until they're all dead.

750
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:26,216
 Can you really live with that?

751
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,593
We have to find
a way to help her.

752
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,262
            Well, there's no way
             to help her, Sonja.

753
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,429
            We can't let her go.

754
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,631
  But what if Nadine's right?

755
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:42,466
         We can't just
     let those people die.

756
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:43,600
 It's halfway around the world.

757
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:44,902
    There's people like that
          everywhere,

758
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,036
     we can't help 'em all.

759
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,005
       Yeah, but we know
       about these people

760
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,073
 and can do something about it.

761
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,209
         Helping Nadine
    means breaking the law.

762
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:53,610
        So? We've risked
    breaking the law before

763
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:54,678
     to do the right thing.

764
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,413
         Not like this.
       This is different.

765
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,248
  How? How is this different?

766
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,683
If you have to ask,

767
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:00,918
 you're not thinking straight.

768
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,352
       Now take a breath.

769
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,687
            (scoffs)
             LASALLE: Seems like

770
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,689
           we're danged if we do
         and danged if we don't.

771
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:07,424
             I mean, if we don't
                   do something,

772
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,294
    the terrorists are gonna get
their hands on them guns anyway.

773
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,062
Yeah, and probably use them
against the very people

774
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,230
    Nadine's trying to save.

775
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:15,098
Nadine knows we know that, too,

776
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,301
probably hoping we'll let her go
         because of it.

777
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:19,136
        It's a catch-22.

778
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,371
PRIDE:
All right,

779
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,973
       we'll let her go.

780
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,710
     But only to follow her
  so she leads us to the guns.

781
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,612
         Wait, you mean
     we're gonna trick her?

782
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,615
  No, not trying to trick her,
    trying to save her life

783
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,650
and keep Boko Haram
from getting those guns.

784
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,987
  And that's gonna have to be
        enough for you.

785
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:40,023
             Clear?

786
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:59,042
   SEBASTIAN:<i> Nadine's still</i>
      <i> heading east towards</i>

787
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:00,978
  <i> Stars and Stripes Boulevard,</i>

788
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,679
      <i> going about 15 miles</i>
     <i> over the speed limit,</i>

789
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:04,514
      in case you want to
    add that to the charges.

790
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:05,716
      Think she's heading
        to the airport?

791
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:07,150
            PATTON:
          I hope not,

792
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,618
       'cause all the RF
        and cell signals

793
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,687
 might screw up the geotracker
      you put in her coat.

794
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,155
    Counting on you, Patton.

795
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,991
  We got to stay close enough
         to protect her

796
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,225
 in case the terrorists attack,

797
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,027
        but not so close
       that she spots us.

798
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,695
   I wonder why they haven't
       attacked her yet.

799
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,230
  LASALLE: Maybe they already
        found the guns,

800
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:21,999
     and if so, they don't
      need to follow her.

801
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,400
    Except they didn't come
      for the guns first,

802
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,552
     they came for Nadine.

803
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:27,703
Don't worry, we're not gonna let
    anything happen to her.

804
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,307
 PRIDE: Just remember, as soon
  as she leads us to the guns,

805
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:32,576
     we got to get Nadine,

806
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:34,411
         get the guns,
   and then get out of there.

807
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:35,679
       Especially if they
      already found them.

808
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,314
      They could be lying
        in wait for her.

809
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:38,782
            PATTON:
 She's getting off on Crofton.

810
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:41,351
She might be headed
to the charter hangars.

811
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,553
            Damn it,
   her signal's breaking up.

812
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,555
    We got to close the gap.

813
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,695
    I don't know about this,
          Christopher.

814
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,631
           I still can't believe
         we're gonna arrest her.

815
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:58,301
      King made the call.
    Let's just do our jobs.

816
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,780
     The storage pods were
    supposed to be unloaded

817
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:12,082
    and on the plane by now.
    I can't wait that long.

818
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,784
    MAN: I'm sorry, Nadine,
       but we got delayed

819
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,536
    getting to the airport.

820
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:17,287
  Wait. Something's happened.

821
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,655
      Where are the guns?

822
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,357
       What do you mean,
      where are the guns?

823
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,792
     Nadine, what's wrong?

824
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,193
      Is everything okay?

825
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:24,728
        Nadine? Nadine!

826
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,796
         (phone beeps)

827
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:30,634
                            MAN:
                            Hey!

828
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,602
What are you doing...
(grunts)

829
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,708
        (sirens wailing)

830
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,863
Nadine, stop!

831
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:00,864
        You followed me.

832
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,432
Yeah, and saved your life again.

833
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,769
      Run to the terminal.
I'm gonna run farther than that.

834
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,804
    Boko Haram's gonna retaliate
 against the villagers for this.

835
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:11,108
   If I can't get them guns,
   at least let me warn them,

836
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,275
                      move them.

837
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,644
            (grunts)

838
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,113
               I have the means.

839
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,115
          I can easily leave the
          country if you let me.

840
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,883
No, I'm sorry, Nadine, I can't.

841
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:22,152
                         Please.

842
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,201
        Percy, you good?

843
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,551
         How's Nadine?

844
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,856
         Where is she?

845
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,426
        Sh-She got away.

846
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,662
         Stay with him.

847
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:20,343
             I want to know what
       happened out there today.

848
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,379
I told you
what I know, Pride.

849
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:25,549
                You told me what
            you want me to know.

850
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:27,751
               No way Nadine got
                  away from you.

851
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:30,754
Damn it, Sonja,

852
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:34,858
    I worked too hard to rebuild
     this team after Brody left.

853
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,693
             Stronger than ever.

854
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,362
How could you be so willing
to risk throwing it all away?

855
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:43,767
 This team means as much, if not
   more, to you than to anybody.

856
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:46,336
                I know that.
Then why the hell won't you
tell me what happened?

857
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,205
 What difference does it make?

858
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,906
     We got the terrorists,
           didn't we?

859
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,608
         And the guns.

860
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,976
   Nadine is not the bad guy.

861
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,212
       Then how come half
      of law enforcement's

862
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:57,280
still out there looking for her?

863
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,348
            (scoffs)

864
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,555
   If I told you, Pride, and
 anybody outside of this office

865
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,923
                      found out,

866
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,858
 you would get in trouble, too.

867
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,327
    I can't let that happen.

868
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,962
I'm already in trouble.

869
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:14,331
     I sacrificed Hamilton
           for this.

870
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,633
         God only knows
   how he's gonna retaliate.

871
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,904
This is serious, Sonja.

872
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:26,009
Not just legally.

873
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:29,246
You cannot cherry-pick
which orders to follow--

874
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,714
not on my watch.

875
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:32,349
That is not what a team is.

876
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:33,850
And I won't stand for it.

877
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:36,620
         And we've had
   this conversation before.

878
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,658
    What happened to Nadine?

879
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,405
           I'm sorry.

880
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,474
            I can't.

881
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:05,015
        That'll be all.

882
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,661
          Hey.

883
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,963
                   Hey.

884
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,598
       You waited for me?

885
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,800
 Well, I was a little worried.

886
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,969
Everything all right?

887
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,538
                   I don't know.

888
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,874
         Pride is pretty pissed.

889
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,877
          Can't say I blame him.

890
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:36,613
           And I... I don't know
         what he's gonna do yet.

891
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:38,882
What does that mean?
Do what?

892
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:42,385
      I don't know if he's
     gonna report me to HQ.

893
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:44,387
            (scoffs)
   King's not gonna do that.

894
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,089
  He knows you'll be done for.

895
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:49,659
       Yeah, like I said,
      he's pretty pissed.

896
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:53,930
Well, did you tell him
what really happened?

897
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,999
             What, you're trying
               to find out, too?

898
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,637
(chuckles)
Don't you trust me?

899
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,608
       Were you jealous?

900
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:10,013
    Guy in the coffee shop.

901
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,116
      Now, what does that
       got to do with...

902
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,618
    Ah, you can't expect me
          to trust you

903
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,487
 if you don't trust me, right?

904
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,456
                   (sighs)

905
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,892
         Well, honestly, I don't
               know what I felt.

906
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,762
                            I...

907
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:28,398
              Maybe I could have
          been a little jealous.

908
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,869
     And maybe I could have
         let Nadine go.

909
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,141
    Hey, look, I don't need
a lecture from you, Christopher,

910
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:41,478
     and I don't want this
 to bite you in the ass later,

911
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,979
so please,

912
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,515
          don't ask me
   any more questions, okay?

913
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,418
                           Okay.

914
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,054
                  Come on, let's
                get out of here.

915
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,628
             Percy.

916
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,396
  Just got off the phone with
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Izzo.

917
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,565
      Judge wants us both
         downtown now.

918
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:13,943
            (sighs)

919
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,078
IZZO: The evidence
clearly contradicts

920
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Agent Percy's statement
to the court.

921
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,815
You lied.

922
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:20,683
                      No. See...

923
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:23,520
      the team was in the middle
            of a firefight. I...

924
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,955
You said in
your sworn statement,

925
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:29,058
          and I quote,
  "Nadine Bancroft got away."

926
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,562
Clearly, you could have arrested
her right then and there.

927
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:34,130
       Cuffed her before
       you went back in.

928
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,699
  I was worried about my team.

929
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,969
    I made a judgment call.

930
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,104
    You let a felon escape.

931
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:44,073
         Okay, hold on.

932
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:47,043
        Just out of curiosity...

933
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:49,446
      what made you think
   to look for surveillance?

934
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,114
     That's not the point.

935
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,781
  It is if this is more about
   retribution than justice.

936
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,885
 Are you condoning your agent's
     behavior, Agent Pride?

937
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:58,788
I'm not condoning a witch hunt,
 if that's what you're asking.

938
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,057
What the hell are
you two talking about?

939
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,060
    Your Honor, Agent Pride
       and Mayor Hamilton

940
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,462
    don't exactly get along.

941
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:06,996
       And what does that
     have to do with this?

942
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,732
     Because when the mayor
   heard about what happened,

943
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:12,602
 he asked the inspector general
   to open an investigation.

944
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:15,171
        Retribution for
     my investigating him.

945
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:16,973
          Conjecture.
        Like hell it is!

946
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,291
JUDGE DORSEY:
Enough.

947
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:19,608
       You two can argue
       about this later.

948
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:21,478
     But it doesn't change
           the facts.

949
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,848
   You're in serious trouble,
          young lady.

950
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,949
Because as far as
I'm concerned,

951
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,984
you're not telling me the truth.

952
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,854
You have one last chance.

953
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:34,023
 I want to know why you didn't
    arrest Nadine Bancroft,

954
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,125
and I want to know
where she is,

955
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,228
    or I'm gonna charge you
          with perjury

956
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,964
   and hold you in contempt.

957
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,832
       Do you understand?

958
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:50,240
                   Karen, Karen,
               come on, come on.

959
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:52,242
Why are you doing this?

960
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:53,710
         Don't blame me, Dwayne.

961
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,111
              Your agent brought
                this on herself.

962
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,679
I'm just doing my job.

963
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,781
           Yeah, more like doing
             Hamilton's bidding.

964
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,251
    Didn't realize that you were
     in the mayor's pocket, too.

965
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:02,252
   You know that's not true.

966
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:03,253
             Do I?

967
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:04,787
                    Bottom line:

968
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,023
          your agent screwed up,
           and Hamilton pounced.

969
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:10,093
  I warned you what would happen
 if he found out about the wire.

970
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:11,294
                 There's nothing
                     I could do.

971
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:14,047
        That's not true.

972
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:16,799
   You gave him the opening,
 now you have to live with it.

973
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,205
What just happened, King?

974
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,173
         Where's Percy?

975
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,047
  They're taking her to jail.
