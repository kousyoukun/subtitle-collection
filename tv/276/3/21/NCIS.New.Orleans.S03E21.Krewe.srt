1
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:34,661
请求支援 红色警报 发生交火
Dispatch! Signal red! Shots fired!

2
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:36,163
发生交火
Shots fired!

3
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:48,008
多名嫌疑人 把所有人都派来
Multiple suspects! Send everybody!

4
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:14,334
嘿 你中枪了吗
Hey, you shot?

5
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:15,602
我不知道
I don't know.

6
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:17,137
我想我没事
I don't think so.

7
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:18,959
刚刚到底发生了什么
What the hell just happened?

15
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:40,994
NCIS <font color=#00FF00>新奥尔良</font>
S03<font color=#00FFFF>E21</font>

16
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,338
我的电脑呢
What about my computer?

17
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,174
那个 网络摄像头还是什么的
The... the webcam or whatever it's called.

18
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,843
我是说 他们能不能黑进去
I mean, c-can't they hack into that

19
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:59,145
在我不知情的情况下偷拍我
and record me without my knowing?

20
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:00,847
我们已经采取了防入侵措施 市长先生
We've already disabled it, Mr. Mayor.

21
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,515
你的笔记本电脑和手机也是
Same with your laptop and cell.

22
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:04,417
你们确定没问题了吗 因为
Yeah. You sure about that? 'Cause, uh,

23
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,620
我不想再有什么漏洞 我的麻烦已经够多了
I don't need no more leaks. I got enough problems.

24
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:08,855
要知道 有些人不遗余力地
Certain people try to bring me down

25
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:11,157
想扳倒我
any way they can, you know?

26
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,827
我们接下来会检查您的车子和家里
We'll scan your car and home next.

27
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,196
目前为止 这个房间是安全的
But, for now, this room's secure.

28
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:18,365
好的 电话也安全吗
Good. Phones, too?

29
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,733
呃 别用座机
Uh, don't use landlines.

30
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,468
但如果你的助理发现 听筒里有回音或敲击声
But make sure your assistant lets you know

31
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,969
让她一定要告诉你
if she hears any echoes or clicks.

32
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:24,471
有可能是线路窃听
Could mean a wiretap.

33
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:26,506
如果真的是窃听 我们应该可以追查到源头
And, if so, we should be able to trace its source.

34
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:27,874
手机呢 没问题吗
What about cell phones-- they good?

35
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,242
手机没问题
Cell's good.

36
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:32,412
好的 那我们也没问题了
All right. We're good, then.

37
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:33,880
两千 是吗
2,000, right?

38
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,615
不必了 我们会给你寄账单
Uh, that's okay, we'll just bill you.

39
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:37,050
不 不行
Uh, no. No, no.

40
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:38,451
不要账单
No bills.

41
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:40,553
这事只有你我知道 明白吗
It's between us, you understand?

42
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:41,755
明白了
Understood.

43
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:43,690
好的
Okay.

44
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:51,331
-你好 -Frank 我是Hamilton
- Hello? - Frank, it's Hamilton.

45
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,066
你确定这条线没问题吗
Are you sure this line is secure?

46
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:54,768
说实话 我现在对什么都不确定了
Honestly, I'm not sure about anything anymore.

47
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,469
让我非常困扰
Gotten in pretty deep here.

48
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:58,905
你也不该感到确定 市长先生 因为我
Nor should you be, Mr. Mayor, 'cause I'm gonna be

49
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:00,840
就站在你跟前 宝贝儿
up and in your grill, baby.

50
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:03,977
他都清理过手机了 我们怎么还能窃听他
How can we still hear him if they swept his cell?

51
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:07,447
你是无法清理3P的影子应用的
You can't sweep a Triple P shadow app,

52
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,983
这个应用让我能窃听并录下
which allows me to listen to and record

53
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:12,953
听得见的任何声音
any and everything within earshot.

54
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:15,055
问题在于 不是所有事情
Problem is, anything and everything isn't covered

55
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:16,690
都在窃听令的许可范围
under the wiretap warrant.

56
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:18,491
只能是关于清水市
Only what's related to Clearwater

57
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:20,727
或者他所谓的海外行贿基金
or his alleged offshore slush funds.

58
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:22,062
还有Javier Garcia的谋杀案
And Javier Garcia's murder.

59
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:23,530
告诉Jess
Let Jess know,

60
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:26,066
我这段时间不能见她了
uh, I won't be seeing her for a while.

61
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:28,868
不能冒险让媒体再挖出什么绯闻了
Can't risk the media finding out about any more of these affairs.

62
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,705
-停止录音 -等等 什么
- Stop recording. - Wait, what?

63
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:33,239
私人信息
Personal information is not covered

64
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,075
不在窃听范围之内
under the scope of the wiretap.

65
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:37,744
听着 Dwayne 如果不能严格按照要求执行
Look, Dwayne, if this isn't done within the strict parameters

66
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:39,813
在法庭上是站不住脚的
of the order, it won't stand up in court.

67
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:42,048
市长并不干净 Karen
Mayor's dirty, Karen.

68
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,484
Rita让这个案子正式成立了
Look, Rita's put together a solid circumstantial case,

69
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:47,153
但是Jenkins... 他是唯一一个愿意
but Jenkins-- he was the only judge willing to risk

70
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:50,156
冒险跟Hamilton对立 同意窃听的法官
going up against Hamilton to grant the tap.

71
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,158
我知道你们有多想扳倒他
I know how bad you want to take him down,

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,994
但如果你们不按法律条文办事
but if you don't do this by the book,

73
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,362
你们会失去窃听许可
you're gonna blow the wiretap.

74
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:57,630
Hamilton就会从谋杀案脱身
And Hamilton gets away with murder.

75
00:03:57,632 --> 00:03:59,666
还有其它案件
And everything else.

76
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,136
停止录音
Stop recording.

77
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,174
好了 我有案子了
Ah, all right, I got a case.

78
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:09,843
继续监视市长
Keep monitoring the mayor.

79
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:12,479
你确定Patton知道监听的关键字吗
Are you sure Patton knows what keywords to listen for?

80
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:13,980
他知道清水市案子的
Is he read in on Clearwater,

81
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:15,482
全部细节了吗
every detail?

82
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:17,350
不 不是全部
No, not everything.

83
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:19,786
那我要是你 我会待在这里
Then I'd stay put if I were you.

84
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:22,155
拿下Hamilton可能只有这一次机会
May only get this one shot at Hamilton.

85
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:35,035
Pride还好吗 他听起来怎么样
Yeah, is Pride all right? How'd he sound?

86
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:36,569
纠结
Torn.

87
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:38,004
必须说服他待在那里
Had to talk him into staying put,

88
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:39,339
集中精力扳倒Hamilton
focusing on trying to get Hamilton

89
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:40,640
在他干掉我们之前
before Hamilton gets us.

90
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:42,442
是啊 King对工作很忠诚
Yeah, King's loyal to the job.

91
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:45,345
让他放弃主导案件侦破很不容易
It's not easy for him not taking the lead on a case.

92
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:47,147
所以我们更要把这个案子办得漂漂亮亮
All the more reason for us to kick ass on this one.

93
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,615
你要我去接Percy吗
Do you want me to go pick up Percy?

94
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:51,117
不用 我已经在咖啡店这里了
No, I'm already here at the coffee shop.

95
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,086
我们一会儿在犯罪...
We'll meet you at the crime...

96
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:56,089
现场见
...scene.

97
00:04:57,826 --> 00:04:59,859
Lasalle
Lasalle?

98
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,796
Lasalle 你还在吗
Lasalle, you still there?

99
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:05,065
是 我还在
Yeah, I'm still here.

100
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,633
一会见
We'll see you in a bit.

101
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:08,535
嗨
Hey!

102
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,036
乡下鼠
Country Mouse.

103
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,504
早知道是你来接我
If I knew you were my ride,

104
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,440
我会给你带个羊角面包
I would've picked you up a croissant.

105
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:17,677
一切还好吗
Everything all right?

106
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,747
当然 我们出发吧
Yeah, sure. Let's roll.

107
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:34,961
嘿 你确定没什么心事吗
Hey, you sure nothing's bothering you?

108
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:36,796
我吗 没啊 怎么了
Me? No, why?

109
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:38,498
我不知道 也许是因为这一路上
I don't know, maybe 'cause you only said, like,

110
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,533
你只跟我说了两个字
two words to me on the way over.

111
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,268
是我哎 怎么回事
Come on, it's me. What?

112
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,603
Gregorio 我们掌握了什么
Gregorio, what do we got?

113
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:44,938
你也好啊 Christopher
Hello to you, too, Christopher.

114
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,573
哦 姐们儿 他心情不太好
Oh, girl, he is in a mood.

115
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,541
看得出来
I can see that.

116
00:05:48,543 --> 00:05:50,043
抢劫团伙很专业
Heist crew were pros,

117
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:51,845
干掉了监控 阻断了通讯
took out cameras, jammed communication,

118
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:54,114
很清楚地知道他们想要的东西是什么 在哪里
knew exactly what they were after and where to get it.

119
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:55,849
Sebastian 货物是什么
Sebastian, what's the haul?

120
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,884
运往Fort Bragg基地的几百个MP5冲锋枪
Couple hundred MP5s headed to Fort Bragg.

121
00:05:57,886 --> 00:05:59,519
海军还在清查库存
The Navy's still doing an inventory

122
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,187
以获知准确数目 不过...
to get an exact count, but...

123
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,656
那可是大批量的重火力武器
That's a lot of serious firepower.

124
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,892
我是说 这不可能只是为了
I mean, this can't just be about selling them

125
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:07,360
到黑市上去卖吧
on the black market.

126
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:09,062
我们遇到了民兵组织之类的吗
We're dealing with some kind of militia?

127
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:11,064
不管他们是谁 都是有备而来的
Well, whoever it was, they came prepared.

128
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,867
根据铁路警察的说法 他们都有防弹衣
According to the railway cops, they all had body armor,

129
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,969
用的是AR-15突击步枪 震荡手雷
were using AR-15s, concussive grenades.

130
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:17,337
有多少人受伤
How many were injured?

131
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,571
怪就怪在这儿 没人受伤
That's the thing-- none.

132
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:22,475
哇 抢劫团伙用了AR-15突击步枪 手雷
Whoa. Heist crew using AR-15s, grenades,

133
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:26,045
带着MP5冲锋枪逃跑 竟然没一个警察中枪
making off with MP5s, and no cop gets shot?

134
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,381
不 警察们被射击了 但射中他们的不是子弹
Oh, no, cops were shot all right, just not with bullets.

135
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:29,749
没错 不是致命的子弹
Yeah, not with lethal rounds.

136
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,117
而是橡胶子弹
With rubber bullets.

137
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,352
专门设计的复合材料
Specifically designed composite,

138
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:33,686
就像中了一记重拳一样
packs a heck of a punch,

139
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:35,221
尤其是用AR-15射出来
especially coming out of an AR-15.

140
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,190
能打得你喘不过气来
It's more than enough to knock the wind out of you.

141
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:39,259
-但不会死人 -那么问题来了
- But not kill. - Which begs the question,

142
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:41,461
什么样的抢劫团伙 去偷上百个致命武器
what kind of heist crew steals hundreds of lethal weapons

143
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:43,129
会带非致命武器呢
using nonlethal rounds?

144
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:44,531
是啊 这说不通
Yeah. Doesn't make sense.

145
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:45,899
是的 但幸亏铁路警察
Yeah, well, fortunately the rail cops

146
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:47,534
用的是真子弹
were using live ammo.

147
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:50,570
他们打中了一个团伙成员
They tagged one of the crew.

148
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:53,173
流了不少血 我应该能通过DNA查明身份
Lost a lot of blood. I should be able to get a DNA I.D.

149
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:54,908
好的 有发现就告诉我们 Sebastian
All right, let us know what you find, Sebastian.

150
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,976
那个有钱人是谁
Who's the fat cat?

151
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,946
枪支制造公司的老板
Owner of the company that makes the guns,

152
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:01,181
Justus Bancroft
Justus Bancroft.

153
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:02,715
或者说是受害者
Or the victim.

154
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:05,418
慢着 在ATF里待了那么多年
Whoa. Spent a lot of years at ATF

155
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:05,418
{\a6}烟酒、火器与爆炸物管理局

156
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,987
看过Bancroft的枪械产品所造成的伤害
seeing the pain Bancroft guns cause.

157
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:10,190
很难把他们当成受害人
Hardly makes them a victim.

158
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,626
打扰一下
Excuse me.

159
00:07:13,628 --> 00:07:16,863
海军罪案调查处 可以和我聊聊吗
NCIS. Mind if I get a word?

160
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:19,032
不好意思 请问有什么问题吗
Sorry, is there a problem?

161
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:21,134
不 当然没问题
No, no, no, not at all.

162
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:22,635
只是 呃
It's just that, uh, well,

163
00:07:22,637 --> 00:07:24,604
我们已经把知道的都告诉警察了
we already told the police everything we know.

164
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:26,139
而且我们必须走了
And we have to go.

165
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:28,374
抱歉 请问你是
I'm sorry, who are you?

166
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:29,809
Nadine
Nadine.

167
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:31,244
Bancroft
Bancroft.

168
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:35,148
特别探员Lasalle
Special Agent Lasalle.

169
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,483
我们之后会和警方沟通 但如果你不介意的话...
We'll talk with NOPD afterwards, but if you don't mind...

170
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:41,120
当然不介意 尽管问
No, no, of course, of course. Ask me anything.

171
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:43,156
只不过 呃 我们明天
Well, it's just that, uh, we're hosting

172
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:44,958
要举办年度慈善活动
our annual charity event tomorrow.

173
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,761
我倒是觉得几百支冲锋枪不知所踪
I kind of think a couple hundred missing submachine guns

174
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:50,964
比你们的小派对更重要 不是吗
trumps your little party, don't you?

175
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,065
Percy
Percy.

176
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:54,901
无意冒犯 但是
No disrespect, but, uh,

177
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:57,470
我们的工作还是要做的 而且枪支数量很多
we got to do our jobs, and that's a lot of guns.

178
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:59,072
对 相信我 我理解
Oh, yeah, trust me, I know.

179
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:01,040
这也不是我们第一次遭遇这种事了
It's not the first time we've been hit, either.

180
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:02,275
你们以前也被抢劫过
You've been robbed before?

181
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:04,911
没有这么严重 但是有过
Well, not to this extent, but yes.

182
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,980
FBI ATF 他们都
Uh, the FBI, ATF, they both investigated

183
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:09,349
调查过前两次抢劫 但无功而返
the other two times, and, uh, come up empty.

184
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,784
我很高兴没有警察受伤
I'm just glad none of the police got hurt.

185
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:14,520
三次 这里面一定有什么联系
Well, third time, there's got to be a connection.

186
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,823
我们会深入调查 并通知你我们的进展
We'll dig into it and let you know what we find.

187
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:18,424
-好的 -我们会和你保持联系
- All right. - We'll be in touch.

188
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,493
你随时可以联系我
You, uh, call me anytime.

189
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:22,128
-谢谢 -好了
- Thank you. - All right.

190
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,263
谢谢
Thanks.

191
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,500
我觉得King
I don't think King

192
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:29,736
不会喜欢你对她说话的态度
would've much liked the way you talked to her.

193
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:32,238
我还不喜欢你对我说话的态度呢
Don't much like the way you talked to me.

194
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,840
她的反应就好像这一切
She acted like this was nothing more

195
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:36,209
只是些麻烦而已
than an inconvenience.

196
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:37,944
你不觉得奇怪吗
That didn't bother you?

197
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,979
哦 我忘了
Oh, I forgot,

198
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:42,682
你对什么都无所谓
nothing's bothering you.

199
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,117
对吧
Right.

200
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,057
在我的办公桌上工作还自在吗
Making yourself at home at my desk?

201
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,659
哦 Pride 不 不 抱歉
Oh, Pride, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

202
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:53,960
我就是 我不想
I just, I didn't want to

203
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:55,628
-打扰你和Patton -没事 Sebastian
- bother you and Patton. - It's okay, Sebastian.

204
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,196
开个玩笑 坐吧
Just teasing. Sit down.

205
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:00,566
能和你换位置再高兴不过了 真的
Be more than happy to trade places with you, believe me.

206
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:02,502
坐在窃听设备旁有点儿无聊吧
Sitting on a wiretap's kind of boring, huh?

207
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:03,770
不如说是单调乏味
More like tedious.

208
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:05,438
而且 我知道了越来越多
Plus, I'm learning more about Hamilton

209
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,907
压根不想知道的Hamilton的事 太多了
than I ever wanted to know. A lot more.

210
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:10,943
但没能把他和谋杀案或清水市联系起来吗
But nothing that connects him to the murders or Clearwater?

211
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:12,612
还没有
Not yet.

212
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:13,613
但这只是
But it's just

213
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:14,881
时间问题
a matter of time.

214
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:16,482
案子进展怎么样了
Where are you on the case?

215
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:19,152
用我在犯罪现场找到的DNA
Well, using the DNA I found at the crime scene,

216
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:21,087
我尝试确认伤者的身份
I'm trying to I.D. our wounded bad guy,

217
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:22,255
但迄今为止 一无所获
but nothing's coming up so far,

218
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:23,790
这个 有点儿奇怪
which is, you know, a little odd.

219
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:25,558
好的 但并非异常
Okay. But not unusual.

220
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,993
我刚和FBI打完电话
I just got off the phone with FBI,

221
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:28,928
看了之前的抢劫记录 他们也没有任何发现
checked on the prior heists, and they got nothing, either.

222
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,730
难以置信
Well, that's hard to believe.

223
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:32,632
三起抢劫大案 没有一点证据
Three high-profile hits, no evidence.

224
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:33,933
这怎么可能呢
How's that possible?

225
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:35,401
更奇怪的是 以前被偷的枪
Even stranger, none of the past stolen guns

226
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:37,003
没有一支出现在街头或者黑市
have showed up on the street or black market.

227
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:38,237
它们就像消失了一样
It's as if they just disappeared.

228
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:41,240
也许我该和你们一起调查的
Yeah, maybe I should get involved.

229
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:42,508
不行 Hamilton知道你在查他
No, Hamilton knows you're after him.

230
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,910
你现在不能松懈 这太重要了
You can't let up now. It's too important.

231
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,878
几百支失踪的枪也很重要
So is a couple hundred missing guns.

232
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
哦 怪不得我一直匹配不上
Oh, no wonder I didn't get a match.

233
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:51,184
我把查找的罪犯性别设置成了男性 而不是女性
I programmed the I.D. search for bad guys, not bad girls.

234
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:52,118
这是性别歧视 顺便说一下
That's male bias, by the way.

235
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,486
我为此道歉
I apologize for that.

236
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:55,955
Josephine Bellacroix
Uh, Josephine Bellacroix.

237
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:57,290
中尉 新奥尔良出生
First Lieutenant, born in New Orleans.

238
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,358
海军陆战队员吗
A Marine?

239
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,726
对 而且档案非常干净
Yeah, flawless record, too.

240
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:02,762
她去过索马里和苏丹
She did a tour in Somalia and Sudan.

241
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:04,297
一年前离开了军队
Left the Corps a year ago.

242
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,466
刚好在第一次劫案发生前
Just before the first heist.

243
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:08,501
不知道是什么让她开始偷枪的
Wonder what made her start stealing guns.

244
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:10,403
带她回来 查清楚
Pick her up, find out.

245
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:11,738
-在你去之前... -好的 我先给Lasalle打电话
- And before you do that... - All right, I'll call Lasalle.

246
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,172
他和Sonja还在值外勤
He and Sonja are still in the field.

247
00:10:13,174 --> 00:10:15,341
Sebastian 着手调查她的同事
Sebastian, start looking for known associates,

248
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:16,511
看能不能找到她的同伙
see if we can find out who she's working with.

249
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:17,611
这就查
I'm on it.

250
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:19,045
嘿
Hey.

251
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,814
我们可以的 不要担心
We got this. Don't worry about us.

252
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:35,161
如果你一直对我采取沉默的方式
If you're gonna keep giving me the silent treatment

253
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:36,629
来折磨我
and being mean to me...

254
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:38,097
我没折磨你
I'm not being mean to you.

255
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,566
好吧 那是怎么回事
Okay, so what's your problem?

256
00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:42,802
我不明白
I don't understand.

257
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:45,004
我就是对今早的事情很吃惊
I was just surprised this morning,

258
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:47,673
看到你和那个人在咖啡馆
seeing you with that guy at the coffee shop.

259
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:50,343
等等 Tom吗
Wait, Tom?

260
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:52,245
我不知道你在跟人约会
I didn't know you were dating anybody.

261
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,647
我没在约会
I'm not dating anybody.

262
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:56,082
只是喝咖啡而已
It was just coffee.

263
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:57,784
再说 我一点都不了解他
Besides, I barely know that guy.

264
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:59,819
你已经了解到可以亲他了
Well, you knew him well enough to kiss him.

265
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:02,422
我没亲他 是他亲的我
I didn't kiss-- he kissed me.

266
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:06,993
你是在吃醋吗
Are you jealous?

267
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:08,694
吃醋
Jealous.

268
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:10,663
-你吃醋了 -你发什么疯呢
- You're jealous. - You're trippin' girl.

269
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:13,099
快点 准备武器
Come on. Let's gear up.

270
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:28,114
散弹枪 不是吧
Shotguns? Really?

271
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:29,715
受伤的陆战队员
Yeah, wounded Marine.

272
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:32,418
她手里应该有一把MP5冲锋枪
She's probably armed with a MP5 by now.

273
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,187
还是小心点好
Better safe than sorry.

274
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:39,225
联邦探员
Federal agents!

275
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,898
Percy
Percy.

276
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:55,808
这不可能只是抢劫中的枪
No way that's just from the heist shooting.

277
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,393
街对面的房子装有安全监控
House across the street has a security camera,

278
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:09,161
但摄像头的角度难以确定
but it's a bad angle to I.D. anyone

279
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:11,197
进出Bellacroix房子的人的身份
going in and out of Bellacroix's place.

280
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:14,233
所以没人拿着MP5冲锋枪走出来吗
Ooh, so no one walking out with an MP5?

281
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,435
有个拿着小包的女士 就这样
Lady carrying a small bag. That's about it.

282
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:17,703
这看起来越来越像
It's looking more and more like

283
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:19,605
那个团伙为了掩盖踪迹干掉了她
the crew took her out to cover their tracks.

284
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:22,542
找个凶狠的家伙把自己人干掉
Takes a pretty vicious crew to take out one of their own.

285
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:23,809
我们得查出他们是谁
We need to find out who they are

286
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,811
这样才能尽快找回那些枪
so we can get those guns back, fast.

287
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:28,114
问题是 他们在掩盖行踪上做得太好了
The problem is, they're so good at covering their tracks,

288
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:29,582
我们什么都没查到
we got squat.

289
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:33,052
要是我们能查清楚 一开始是什么让一个光荣的陆战队员
Yeah. If we could just figure out what made a decorated Marine

290
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:35,121
加入一个抢劫团伙
join a heist crew in the first place.

291
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:37,123
你确定在她的服役记录中
Are you sure there weren't any red flags

292
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,324
没有任何危险信号吗
in her service record?

293
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,359
没有创伤后应激障碍 没有心理恐慌
No PTSD, no psych alarm.

294
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:43,262
她的同事中是否有犯罪记录
Any of her known associates with criminal backgrounds?

295
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,699
没有 Bellacroix是新奥尔良本地人
No. Bellacroix's a NOLA native,

296
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,699
路易斯安那州立大学研究生 名列前茅
LSU grad, top of her class.

297
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:48,434
说了吧 什么都查不到
Like I said, squat.

298
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:52,305
听我说 我知道监听Hamilton比什么都重要
Look, I know the Hamilton wire is important and everything,

299
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:54,574
但也许是时候让Pride参与进来了
but think maybe it's time to loop Pride in?

300
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:58,077
King希望我们能找到线索
King's expecting us to find leads.

301
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:01,347
继续调查吧
Let's keep digging.

302
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:03,716
好吧
All right.

303
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:08,654
嘿 大家好
Hey, guys.

304
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:10,590
天啊 回到这里看着你们在那边
Oh, man, it's so weird being back here

305
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:11,991
感觉好奇怪
and seeing you guys there.

306
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:15,528
这种感觉就像是"我以为自己离开了 他们又把我拉回去..."
It's like, “Just when I thought I was out, they pulled...”

307
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:15,528
{\a6}原文：Just when I thought I was out,they pull me back in

308
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,264
是《教父3》里Michael Corleone的台词
It's Michael Corleone, from, uh, from <i>The Godfather 3.</i>

309
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:23,302
我的屏幕好像... 卡住了
Guys, I think my... my screen froze.

310
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,904
说说被害者的弹道分析
Ballistics on the victim, please.

311
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:26,238
对 好的
Right, sure.

312
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,274
死者身上的弹道模式表明
Well, the bullet pattern on our dead Marine

313
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:31,010
13发子弹全部来自于MP5冲锋枪
suggests that all 13 bullets came from an MP5.

314
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,778
要我说 那真是枪林弹雨
Which, if you ask me, that's overkill.

315
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,548
更有理由怀疑 是她的同伙杀了她
Even more reason to suspect her crew took her out.

316
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,716
即使如此 还是有些地方对不上
Still, something doesn't add up.

317
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:38,618
他们抢劫的时候用的是橡皮子弹
They went out of their way to use rubber bullets

318
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,186
现在却用真的子弹
for the heist, but then use real bullets

319
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:41,420
去杀自己人吗
to kill one of their own?

320
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:44,023
或许他们知道 杀警察会被判处死刑
Maybe they knew killing cops guarantees the needle.

321
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:47,059
但如果他们把其中一把枪变成了杀人凶器
Yeah, but if any of those guns end up as the murder weapon,

322
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,327
他们还是会被判处死刑
they'll get the needle anyway.

323
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,895
我们漏掉了什么
We're missing something.

324
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,931
嗨 那些橡胶子弹有什么发现吗
Hey, did you get anything on those rubber bullets yet?

325
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,367
你们让我验尸完
You wanted me to call

326
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,769
马上给你们打电话
as soon as the autopsy was completed.

327
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:58,170
哇 嘿 医生
Whoa. Hey, Doc.

328
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,106
简直了 这就跟从前一样
This is so crazy, it's like old times.

329
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:01,874
你 我 血浆
You, me, plasmas.

330
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,476
我不知道你在你的实验室 Sebastian
I didn't know you were in your lab, Sebastian.

331
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:05,011
你怎么没来打招呼呢
Why didn't you say something?

332
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:06,912
我知道当你忙于解剖抽不开身的时候
Well, I know better than to bother you

333
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,781
还是不要打扰你为好
when you're elbow deep in liver.

334
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:10,116
抱歉打断你们
I hate to interrupt.

335
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:11,951
验尸结果 对
Autopsy results, right.

336
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:13,319
好吧 不出所料
Okay, no surprises.

337
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:16,255
死因是多处枪伤
C.O.D.: multiple gunshot wounds.

338
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:19,759
子弹击中了每个重要的动脉和器官
The bullets hit every major artery and organ,

339
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,560
击中其中任何一个部位都足以致死
and any one of them would've sufficed.

340
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:25,297
这显然是一起声明性的谋杀
This was obviously a statement killing.

341
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,767
好让其他成员乖乖听话
One way to keep the rest of the crew in line.

342
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:29,535
但是 有一个异常
However, there is an anomaly.

343
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:32,071
在Bellacroix女士被杀之前
Before Ms. Bellacroix was murdered,

344
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:34,840
有人缝合了她在抢劫时
someone sutured the initial gunshot wound

345
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,676
由铁路警察造成的
inflicted by the railway officer

346
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,144
初始枪伤
during the heist.

347
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:39,679
甚至取出了子弹
Even removed the bullet.

348
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:42,915
等等 他们要杀她 为什么还要救她
Wait, why would they try to save her only to kill her?

349
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,417
这根本说不通啊
That doesn't make any sense.

350
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:46,952
尤其是当你知道 他们还给她
Especially when you factor in that they gave her

351
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:50,990
用了广谱抗病毒药物 来预防感染
broad-spectrum prophylaxis to fight infection.

352
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:52,858
移除了子弹 还进行了缝合
Bullet removal, sutures,

353
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,193
抗生素 这必须由
antibiotics-- I mean, this has to

354
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:55,861
一名医生来完成 是吗
have been done by a doctor, right?

355
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:57,296
有可能
Maybe.

356
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:58,798
但她并没有去过医院
But she didn't go to a hospital.

357
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,634
那个提着包的女人
The lady with the bag.

358
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:03,169
Sebastian 你跟他们说了
Sebastian, did you tell them about

359
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,303
橡胶子弹的事吗
the rubber bullets yet?

360
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:06,072
没 还没有
No, not yet.

361
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:07,173
是这样 各地警察都一直希望
So, um, police everywhere have been

362
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:08,240
越来越多地使用
looking to use more and more

363
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,408
非致命性子弹
nonlethal ammo.

364
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,143
这对枪支制造商来说是个发财的机会
It's been a real boon for gun manufacturers.

365
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:14,246
幸运的是 每个制造橡胶子弹的公司
Fortunately, each company that makes rubber bullets

366
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,482
都有自己专门的设计 所以
uses its own proprietary design, so,

367
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:19,485
抢劫团伙使用的子弹
the bullets used by the heist crew

368
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,487
实际上是Bancroft的子弹
are actually Bancroft bullets.

369
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:24,790
用Bancroft的子弹来偷Bancroft的枪吗
Bancroft bullets used to steal Bancroft guns?

370
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,959
我可能找到了另一个与Bancroft的联系
I might've found another Bancroft connection.

371
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,295
抱歉 医生 我要把屏幕給另一名医生了
Sorry, Doc, I need the screen for another doc.

372
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:32,598
Emma Miller 一名无国界医生
Emma Miller, a Doctors Without Borders physician,

373
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,033
档案显示 也是Bellacroix的医生
also Bellacroix's doctor of record.

374
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:35,768
她们一起在新奥尔良长大
They grew up in New Orleans together

375
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,237
同一时间从路易斯安纳州立大学毕业
and graduated LSU at the same time.

376
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,606
这说得通 Bellacroix会找一名医生朋友
Which makes sense Bellacroix would call a doctor friend

377
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,302
来帮她缝合 且不会出卖她
to stitch her up without ratting her out.

378
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:42,943
嗯
Mm-hmm.

379
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:46,345
我们需要找到Miller医生 看看她怎么说
Yeah, we need to find Dr. Miller and see what she has to say.

380
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:47,646
与Bancroft的联系是什么
What's the Bancroft connection?

381
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:49,515
非常大的关系 Miller医生是
A big one. Dr. Miller sits on the board

382
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:52,551
新奥尔良Bancroft家族基金会的董事会成员
of the Bancroft Family Foundation of New Orleans.

383
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:55,421
也就是说 她现在可能正在参加慈善舞会
Which means that she could be at that charity shindig right now.

384
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:57,356
Bancroft的子弹 枪支和朋友
Bancroft bullets, guns and friends.

385
00:15:57,358 --> 00:16:00,126
你们觉得这是内部人搞的事情吗
You guys think this is an inside job?

386
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:03,696
唯一能让我们搞清楚的方式就是冲进他们的派对了
Only way to find out is for us to crash their little party.

387
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:04,964
等等
Hold on.

388
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,866
Bancrofts是这里的创始家族
Bancrofts are a founding family here,

389
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:08,467
有几代人的历史
go back for generations.

390
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,736
我们不能直接冲进去 开始盘问
We can't just show up and start asking questions.

391
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:13,105
或许我们不能 但是Pride可以
Maybe we can't, but Pride can.

如果是要谈那些丢失的枪
Now, look, if this about those stolen guns,

423
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:31,317
现在不是时候
now is not the best time.

有人被你的枪所杀 Bancroft先生
Someone was killed with one of your guns, Mr. Bancroft.

425
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,487
如果我们不尽快找出是谁偷了那些枪
And if we don't find out who stole them real soon,

426
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,223
或许会有更多人丧命
more will likely die.

你见过Emma Miller医生吗
Have you seen Dr. Emma Miller?

430
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,565
当然 她帮助我们建立基金会
Well, sure, of course. She helped set up.

431
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,334
她和这件事有什么关系
What's she got to do with this?

432
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:49,969
我们还不确定 所以我们想要和她谈谈
Yeah, we're not sure. That's why we want to talk to her.

433
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:50,903
我们会低调进行的
We'll be discreet.

Nadine, honey, they're just looking for Emma.

439
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,979
你看见过她吗
Have you seen her?

440
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,948
见过 她就在附近 但是你们不能待会再找她吗
Yeah, she's here somewhere, but can't you do this later?

441
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,350
恐怕不行
Afraid not.

442
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:05,818
你对Miller医生了解多少
How well do you know Dr. Miller?

443
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,519
她就像是我的姐姐

看上去是两三个小时前发生的
Looks like it happened a couple hours ago.

454

甚至可能在派对开始前
Maybe even before the party started.

455
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,757
我们刚从Miller医生的家里回来
Well, we just got back from Dr. Miller's house.

456
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,227
找到了防弹衣 帽子和夜视镜
Found body armor, a balaclava and night vision goggles.

457
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:50,829
所以 除非她是喜欢深夜在敌人的火力下进行手术
So, unless she liked performing surgery in the dark

458
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:53,465
不然她就是抢劫团伙的一员
and under enemy fire, I'd say she was part of the heist crew.

459
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,834
团伙中有两个女人吗 这不太正常啊
Two women on the crew? That's unusual.

460
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,703
但如果这是真的 那团伙成员想掩盖行踪
Yeah, but if it's true, it doesn't make sense

461
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,872
就解释不通了
that the crew's trying to cover their tracks now.

462
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,974
一定是有其他人在针对她们
It's got to be somebody else targeting them.

463
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,342
比如 敌对团伙吗
Like what, a rival crew?

464
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:06,445
想为他们自己搞到那些枪 也是有可能
Trying to get the guns for themselves, possibly.

465
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:09,615
可能有个黑市买手出卖了她们
Could be a black market buyer double-crossing them.

466
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:11,984
你在Miller家里找到橡胶子弹了吗
You find any rubber bullets at Miller's house?

467
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:15,087
找到了 有几个盒子 都是Bancroft产的
Yeah, several boxes, actually. All of them made by Bancroft.

468
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:17,122
Bancroft的名字一直在不停出现 不是吗
Bancroft's name just keeps popping up, doesn't it?

469
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:19,224
出现的地方比你想的要多
Popping up in more places than you think.

470
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:21,460
你们来听听这个 但得快点
You need to hear this, but hurry.

471
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:23,462
你需要命令NCIS
<i>You need to get NCIS</i>

472
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:25,531
别再找我麻烦 知道吗
off my back, you understand?

473
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,567
我不能让他们调查那些失踪的枪支
I can't have them investigating those missing guns,

474
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,402
-现在不行 -什么意思
- not now. - What does that mean?

475
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:31,670
难道你知道它们的去向
You know where they are?

Hamilton was on the phone just starting

478
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:37,876
正想讨论清水市 Bancroft就闯进来了
to talk about Clearwater when Bancroft bulled his way in.

479
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,211
-嘘 -但是我和NCIS之间
- Shh. - But I got enough

480
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:40,546
麻烦已经够多了
of my own problems with NCIS.

481
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:41,814
对此我也无能为力
There's nothing I can do.

482
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:43,782
你可以利用你的关系
You can use your connections.

483
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,818
越过他们
Go over their heads.

484
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,054
说你可以自己把枪找回来 变成英雄
Say you'll get the guns back on your own. Be a hero.

485
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:51,824
那我又怎样恰好找回了那些枪呢
Yeah, and how am I supposed to get those guns back exactly?

486
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:53,792
这事交给我
You leave that to me.

487
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,163
和清水市没什么关系
Wasn't anything to do with Clearwater,

488
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:00,699
但我认为不管怎样都应该录下来
but I thought I should record it anyway.

489
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,102
难以相信Bancroft偷了他自己的枪
Can't believe Bancroft stole his own guns.

490
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:04,803
问题是 为什么呢
Yeah, question is: why?

491
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,605
这么一家金融巨头
Company's doing great financially,

492
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,407
不缺这点儿保险赔偿
doesn't need the insurance payoff.

493
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,809
有什么关系 反正我们也不能用刚刚听到的消息
Doesn't matter, we can't use what we just heard anyway.

494
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,244
窃听范围
Scope of the wiretap

495
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:14,313
仅限于Hamilton和清水市
is only for Hamilton and Clearwater.

496
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:16,115
我们不能就这样忽视它
Well, we can't just ignore it.

497
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:18,250
所有人都把他牵扯进来了
Man all but incriminated himself.

498
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,586
为什么你不直接逮捕Bancroft 给他施压
Why don't you just bring Bancroft in, scare him?

499
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:21,820
之后再让律师辩论
And let the lawyers argue

500
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:23,555
这是否被允许
whether it was admissible or not later.

501
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,758
因为那样Bancroft就会发现录音的事情
Because then Bancroft would find out about the tap,

502
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,559
意味着Hamilton也会知道
which means so would Hamilton.

503
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,262
这会毁掉你唯一扳倒他的机会
And then it would blow your one chance to bring him down.

504
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:33,165
但是另一方面 因为这批枪
Yeah, on the other hand, two people are already dead

505
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,800
已经死了两个人
'cause of those guns.

506
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:37,536
在我们将他们捉拿归案前 还有多少人会因此而死
How many more are gonna die before we get them back?

507
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,405
所以你打算怎么办
So what are you gonna do?

508
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:52,584
你做了一个错误的决定
You're making a mistake.

509
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,830
风险太大了 Pride 只是说说
It's a big risk, Pride. Just saying.

510
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:07,833
希望我们不会因此失去扳倒Hamilton的机会
Hope we don't lose Hamilton over it.

511
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,368
我也是
Me, too.

512
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:24,958
不得不说 我有一点吃惊
Got to say, I'm a little surprised.

513
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,726
凭你的本事
Man of your means--

514
00:21:26,728 --> 00:21:29,496
还以为 你现在会要求一个律师
would've thought you'd have asked for a lawyer by now.

515
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,432
我是无辜的 我不需要律师
I'm innocent. I don't need a lawyer.

516
00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:34,434
无辜的人不会让自己犯罪的
Well, innocent men don't tend to incriminate themselves,

517
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:36,269
Bancroft先生
Mr. Bancroft.

518
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:39,339
如果我已经有了逮捕令 你会怎么想
How else do you think I would've gotten an arrest warrant?

519
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,541
我不知道 请你直说
I don't know, you tell me.

520

Patton?

521
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:45,846
好
Yeah.

522
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,080
不好意思 Bancroft
I'm sorry, Bancroft,

523
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,915
但是我和NCIS之间的麻烦已经够多了
but I got enough of my own problems with NCIS.

524
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,083
对此我也无能为力
There's nothing I can do.

525
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:51,985
你可以利用你的关系
You can use your connections,

526
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:53,487
越过他们
go over their heads.

527
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:57,357
说你可以自己把枪找回来 变成英雄
Say you'll get the guns back on your own. Be a hero.

528
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,293
那我又该怎样恰好找回了那些枪呢
Yeah, and how am I supposed to get those guns back exactly?

529
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:02,796
这事交给我
You leave that to me.

530
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:06,266
我听着不像是无辜的啊
Doesn't sound so innocent to me.

531
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:09,002
这是断章取义
That is taken out of context.

532
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:11,438
另外 你是怎么得到这个的
Besides, how'd you get that?

533
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,474
你窃听我吗 理由是什么
You put a tap on me? On what grounds?

534
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:17,043
不是窃听你 而是市长
Tap wasn't on you. It was on the mayor.

535
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,212
你只是求错了人
You just got help from the wrong person,

536
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,547
然后被逮到了
got caught.

537
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,150
我不在乎你为什么要偷自己的枪
I don't give a damn why you stole your own guns.

538
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:26,353
我只想在更多的人被杀害前 找回这批枪
I just want to get 'em back before anybody else gets killed.

539
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:28,088
我没有偷
I didn't steal them.

540
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,190
那你为什么知道这批枪在哪儿
Then why do you know where the guns are?

541
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:32,993
为什么你跟Hamilton说你可以把枪拿回来
How come you told Hamilton you can get 'em back?

542
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:38,932
除非你开始坦白 地检署将会指控你
Unless you start talking, U.S. attorney's gonna charge you

543
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:41,568
作为共犯 重度谋杀罪
as a coconspirator, felony murder.

544
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,739
你不想以后的人生都在监狱度过吧
You don't want to spend the rest of your life in prison,

545
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,074
坦白 快点
talk... fast.

546
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:52,212
我不能
I can't.

不好意思 Pride 但是Izzo来了
Sorry, Pride, but Izzo's here.

548
00:22:58,353 --> 00:23:00,620
她坚持要跟你谈话
She insists on talking to you.

549
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:03,623
你知道当初我单单为了安装窃听设备
<i>Do you realize how many</i> <i>hoops I had to jump through</i>

550
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,126
就要突破多少障碍吗
just to get that wiretap granted in the first place?

551
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:07,594
我知道 Karen 但是我必须
I know, Karen, but I had...

552
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,329
没有但是 Dwayne
No buts, Dwayne.

553
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:12,899
你用窃听Hamilton得到的证据逮捕了Bancroft
You based the arrest of Bancroft on Hamilton's wiretap.

554
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:15,535
一个优秀的被告辩护律师不会这么容易善罢甘休的
A good defense attorney will get that kicked easily.

555
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:17,204
Bancroft犯了罪
Well, Bancroft incriminated himself.

556
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:18,205
那我应该怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

557
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:19,573
你就应该忽视掉
You were supposed to ignore

558
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,408
你所听到的 那就是该做的
what you heard, that's what.

559
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,810
太多的枪消失了 我需要做出选择
Too many guns are missing. I had to make a choice.

560
00:23:23,812 --> 00:23:25,845
这是一个可能会让你失去
A choice that's probably gonna cost you

561
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:27,847
扳倒Hamilton的机会的选择
any chance of bringing down Hamilton.

562
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:30,917
他会发现的 如果他现在还没有的话
He's gonna find out, if he hasn't already.

563
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,319
我稍后会考虑这个问题的
I'll worry about that later.

564
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:34,654
不 你现在就应该考虑
No, you need to worry about that now.

565
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:38,892
Dwayne 如果Hamilton市长真的像你说的那么不堪
Dwayne, if Mayor Hamilton is as dirty as you say he is,

566
00:23:38,894 --> 00:23:40,193
他会报复你的
he's going to retaliate.

567
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:41,661
你知道他会
You know he will.

568
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:44,097
我不会让更多的人被杀害
I wasn't gonna let more people get killed.

569
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:45,532
你应该打电话给我
You should've called me!

570
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:47,867
我没有时间 我必须行动
I didn't have time, I had to act.

571
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,269
我警告过你
I warned you.

572
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:50,737
我警告过你用监听的方式
I warned you about the risk

573
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:52,906
调查Hamilton这种大人物
of going after a powerful man like Hamilton,

574
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:55,508
风险有多高
about blowing the wire.

575
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,011
你完全没意识到你在做什么
You have no idea what you've done.

576
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:13,560
她看起来不怎么高兴
Well, she doesn't seem happy.

577
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:15,528
她是不高兴
She's not.

578
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,997
但还是回到正题吧
But let's stay on point.

579
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:21,234
Bancroft不肯开口 我想我知道原因
Bancroft's not talking, and I think I know why.

580
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:24,404
我不知道他是怎么跟被偷的枪支牵扯上的
I don't know how he's involved with the stolen guns,

581
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:25,939
但是我丝毫不怀疑
but there's no question in my mind

582
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:27,407
他知道这批枪在哪儿
that he knows where they are.

583
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:29,576
-但他还是不会告诉你 -不会
- But he still wouldn't tell you? - Nope.

584
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:32,112
我认为他在保护某个人
And I think it's because he's protecting somebody,

585
00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:34,748
某个他宁愿为其蹲监狱的人
somebody he's willing to go to jail for.

586
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,850
他的女儿
His daughter.

587
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,618
Nadine怎么会
How can Nadine

588
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,986
牵扯进这种事
possibly be involved in this?

589
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:41,621
她牵扯的程度可能比你想象的要深
Well, she may be more involved than you think.

590
00:24:41,623 --> 00:24:45,025
我用先进的链接和社交网络分析
I just ran case and victim profiles

591
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,826
运行了案例和受害者资料
through advanced link and social network analysis;

592
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:48,295
猜猜谁的名字出现在得分榜上
guess whose name lit up the scoreboard.

593
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:50,030
Nadine Bancroft
Nadine Bancroft.

594
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,865
她也涉及到数个不同层面的案件
She connects to the case on several levels, too:

595
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:55,468
地域 社会经济 年龄 学校 社交媒体
geographic, socioeconomic, age, schools, social media.

596
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,736
在另外三个朋友的婚礼上
I mean, all were bridesmaids

597
00:24:56,738 --> 00:24:58,204
她都是伴娘
at three other friends' weddings.

598
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,673
无国界医生 陆战队员
Doctors Without Borders, Marines,

599
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:01,408
Nadine加入了和平队
Nadine joined the Peace Corps.

600
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,611
这些人并不仅仅是一群富豪
I mean, these are hardly just a bunch of rich debutantes.

601
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:06,646
可以解释为什么没有人能抓住这个团队
Could explain why nobody's been able to catch the crew.

602
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:08,615
没有人会怀疑他们 而且
Nobody would ever suspect them, plus...

603
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:10,850
Nadine知道怎样窃取枪支
Nadine would know exactly how to steal the guns

604
00:25:10,852 --> 00:25:11,985
而不被抓住
without getting caught.

605
00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:14,487
你是很认真地在说
Are you seriously suggesting that

606
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:16,856
Nadine Bancroft是抢劫团伙的一员吗
Nadine Bancroft is part of the heist crew?

607
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:19,826
她从自己家偷枪支 为什么呢
That she stole the guns from her own family? Why?

608
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:22,996
不知道 但是如果他父亲发现她做的事情
Don't know, but if her father found out what she was doing,

609
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:25,365
他在努力保护她 这是说得通的
makes sense he's trying to protect her.

610
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,934
这也是为什么他跟Hamilton说会帮忙找回枪支
And that's why he told Hamilton he'd get him back the guns.

611
00:25:27,936 --> 00:25:30,870
所以 这位富家女是在博人眼球吗
So, what, Silver Spoon here is vying for attention?

612
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:33,573
在反对他们多么有钱 还是什么
Rebelling against how rich they are or something?

613
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,875
不 他们这样做一定有别的原因
Nah, there's got to be another reason why they're doing this.

614
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:38,611
不管什么理由 这是一大批枪
Yeah, it's a lot of guns, whatever the reason.

615
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,347
问题是 除非我们找出原因 否则就不会知道
Problem is, we're never gonna figure out who's killing off

616
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:42,082
是谁在杀害抢劫团伙
the heist crew unless we figure out why.

617
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:46,419
意思是 他们接下来可能会杀Nadine
Which means, they could be after Nadine next.

618
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,788
通知警方
Alert NOPD.

619
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,924
让他们去Bancroft家
Get 'em out to the Bancrofts'.

620
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,125
出发
Let's go.

621
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,066
我们到了现场 Christopher 准备
<i>We're on scene,</i> <i>Christopher. Stand by.</i>

622
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:03,069
收到 发现Nadine了吗
Copy that. Any sign of Nadine?

623
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:04,637
没 暂时没有
<i>No, not yet.</i>

624
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:07,540
有人开枪
Shots fired!

625
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:11,611
我认为他们已经抓到了Nadine
<i>I think they've got Nadine!</i>

626
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,979
我们还在追
<i>We're in pursuit!</i>

627
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:13,980
他们正朝你方向逃去
They're coming your way!

628
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:15,181
围住他们
Box 'em in!

629
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:16,783
我们马上就到
<i>We're almost there.</i>

630
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,054
他们来了 我们围到他们了 Pride
<i>Here they come!</i> <i>We got 'em, Pride!</i>

631
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,900
趴下 Nadine
Drop, Nadine!

632
00:26:45,213 --> 00:26:47,113
你安全了
You're okay.

633
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:50,850
你安全了 你安全了
You're okay. You're okay.

634
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,778
我不想催你 Loretta 但
Hate to rush you, Loretta, but...

635
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,080
请告诉我 你能确认他们的身份
please tell me you can help us identify...

636
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:10,682
他们是博科圣地的人
They're Boko Haram.

637
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:10,682
{\a6}尼日利亚极端组织

638
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:13,751
至少这两个人隶属于
At least, that's the particular terrorist group

639
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:15,153
这个恐怖组织
these two gunmen belonged to.

640
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,856
博科圣地出现在新奥尔良
Boko Haram in New Orleans?

641
00:27:17,858 --> 00:27:19,190
你确定吗
Are you sure?

642
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:20,925
很不幸 我确定
Unfortunately, I am.

643
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:24,062
注意那条从额头到鼻子的伤疤
Notice the scarring from forehead to nose,

644
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:26,598
脸上还有两条笔直的线
the two rectilinear lines down the cheeks.

645
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,066
部落伤疤
Tribal scars.

646
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:32,437
许多非洲少数民族使用不同的面部标识
Many African ethnic groups use distinctive facial markings--

647
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:37,408
约鲁巴人 伊博人 豪撒人 但这两位是卡努里人
Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa-- but these men are Kanuri.

648
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,111
他们被博科圣地重金招募
Heavily recruited by Boko Haram.

649
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:42,380
我一直都不敢相信 直到
I couldn't believe it myself until

650
00:27:42,382 --> 00:27:45,850
在他脚踝上看到了这个瘢痕纹身
I saw the keloid tattoo on their ankles.

651
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:47,719
BH
“BH.”

652
00:27:47,721 --> 00:27:49,854
我在非洲做了很长时间的
You know how much time I've spent

653
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:51,489
志愿者 Dwayne
volunteering in Africa, Dwayne.

654
00:27:51,491 --> 00:27:53,324
我亲眼见过
I've witnessed firsthand

655
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:55,026
这些畜生在无辜的女人和孩子身上
the horrors these animals perpetrate

656
00:27:55,028 --> 00:27:56,527
干的坏事
on innocent women and children.

657
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:58,263
我知道 Loretta
I know, Loretta.

658
00:27:58,265 --> 00:28:00,465
我们会尽全力阻止他们
We're gonna do everything we can to stop them.

659
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:01,599
问题是
Yeah, the question is:

660
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:03,368
他们在这里干什么
what are they doing here?

661
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,104
为什么要杀抢劫团伙呢
And why are they killing the heist crew?

662
00:28:06,106 --> 00:28:08,439
他们肯定想要那些枪
They must want the guns.

663
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,341
但是 他们一开始是怎么知道
But still, how'd they know Nadine and her crew

664
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:12,243
Nadine和她的人想要偷走枪呢
were gonna steal the guns in the first place?

665
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:13,578
不知道
I don't know.

666
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,346
也许Nadine能告诉我们
Maybe Nadine could tell us.

667
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:17,615
告诉其他人 我们马上回去
Let the rest of the team know we're heading back.

668
00:28:17,617 --> 00:28:19,150
让Gregorio
Have Gregorio

669
00:28:19,152 --> 00:28:21,219
通报国土安全部和FBI
alert DHS and FBI.

670
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:23,988
我怀疑 这只是袭击小队中的两名成员而已
Doubt these are the only two members of the hit squad,

671
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,858
我们需要其他机构帮忙 追捕其他人
which means we could use a lot of help finding the others.

672
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,459
这就去
On it.

673
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:33,531
他们肯定要活捉Nadine 而不是杀害她
Must've taken Nadine instead of killing her

674
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:36,534
希望她能告诉他们枪在哪儿
in hopes that she would tell 'em where the guns were hidden.

675
00:28:36,536 --> 00:28:39,604
肯定要对她严刑逼供
No doubt by torturing her.

676
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:40,805
你说什么
What do you mean?

677
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,206
那位海军陆战队员
From the Marine.

678
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:45,944
韧带撕裂 死前挫伤
Torn ligaments, antemortem bruising.

679
00:28:45,946 --> 00:28:48,012
初步检查的时候没有发现
I didn't see it in the prelim,

680
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:50,715
但是这个可怜的女人在死前
but the poor woman was clearly tortured

681
00:28:50,717 --> 00:28:52,483
肯定被严刑逼供了
before she was executed.

682
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:55,420
他们可能从她这儿获取了所有想要的情报
They would've gotten everything they wanted from her.

683
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:57,655
Dwayne
Dwayne,

684
00:28:57,657 --> 00:28:59,891
一定要抓住这些混蛋
you've got to get these bastards.

679
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:01,960
但要小心
But be careful.

685
00:29:06,466 --> 00:29:10,034
你们救了我 我很感激
You saved my life, and I'm grateful.

686
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:12,370
但我不能告诉你们枪在哪里
But I can't tell you where the guns are.

687
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:14,305
好吧 我不明白
Okay, I don't understand.

688
00:29:14,307 --> 00:29:17,075
你偷了你父亲的枪
You stole your father's guns.

689
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:19,243
两个伙伴被杀了
Two of your friends were killed,

690
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:20,979
你差点儿被杀
you were nearly killed,

691
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:24,115
为什么还不配合我们
and you won't cooperate with us?

692
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:26,517
你以为你是谁
Who do you think you are?

693
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,987
这不重要 你不会相信我
Doesn't matter, you won't believe me.

694
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:31,489
试试看
Try me.

695
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:37,161
Emma和我几年前去过苏丹的城市Jo
Emma and I visited Jo in Sudan a couple of years ago.

696
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:39,030
我们都很震惊
We were shocked.

697
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:41,232
那儿和这儿有天壤之别
It couldn't have been more different than here--

698
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:44,869
战乱 饥荒
war-torn, famine.

699
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:47,872
那儿是人道主义灾难
Place is a humanitarian disaster.

700
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:51,075
我们自愿在[苏丹首都]喀土穆帮助村民
We volunteered to help villagers set up

701
00:29:51,077 --> 00:29:53,311
建立起一座女子学校
a girls' school in Khartoum,

702
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:55,680
但是博科圣地发动了袭击
but then Boko Haram attacked.

703
00:29:55,682 --> 00:29:57,448
我们逃到大使馆
We were whisked

704
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,284
寻求庇护 但是
into the embassy for safety, but...

705
00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:04,622
我们通过大门看到不断发生的袭击
we watched the attack keep happening through the gates.

706
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:08,459
但是没人想去阻止
And nobody tried to stop it.

707
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:12,363
女人被强暴
Women being raped,

708
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:14,532
孩子被射杀
children being shot.

709
00:30:15,902 --> 00:30:18,236
我们却无能为力
And there was nothing we could do.

710
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:23,041
你不可能忘记这些事
You don't ever unsee something like that.

711
00:30:26,846 --> 00:30:29,047
枪是给村民的
Guns are for the villagers.

712
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:31,949
用来保护自己
To protect themselves.

713
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:33,718
因为没有人会保护他们
'Cause nobody else will.

714
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,154
但博科圣地一定是发现了
But Boko Haram must've found out

715
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:37,255
我们做的事
what we've been doing,

716
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:39,123
所以他们来到这里 要阻止我们
so they came here to try and stop us.

717
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,459
这是个崇高的动机
It's a noble cause,

718
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:44,896
但这是完全违法的
but it's-it's completely illegal.

719
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:47,065
偷枪
Stealing guns,

720
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:50,601
走私到海外
smuggling them out of the country...

721
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:54,672
违反了15条联邦法律 你是知道的
breaks 15 federal laws, you know that.

722
00:30:56,276 --> 00:30:59,677
你真的愿意冒着生命危险这么做 对吗
You're really willing to risk your life for this, aren't you?

723
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,013
是的
Yes, I am.

724
00:31:04,484 --> 00:31:06,250
如果你们不让我走
If you don't let me go,

725
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:08,352
不把枪给村民
get the villagers those guns...

726
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,289
博科圣地会一直袭击他们
...Boko Haram will keep attacking them

727
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,124
直到他们全死光
until they're all dead.

728
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:17,095
你真的能接受吗
Can you really live with that?

729
00:31:25,438 --> 00:31:27,305
我们必须想办法帮她
We have to find a way to help her.

730
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:29,040
没办法帮她 Sonja
Well, there's no way to help her, Sonja.

731
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,174
我们不能放她走
We can't let her go.

732
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:31,509
但要是Nadine说的是真的呢
But what if Nadine's right?

733
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:33,211
我们不能眼睁睁看着那些人死去
We can't just let those people die.

734
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:34,312
这事儿发生在大半个地球外
It's halfway around the world.

735
00:31:34,314 --> 00:31:35,413
这样的人到处都有
There's people like that everywhere,

736
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:36,714
我们帮不了所有人
we can't help 'em all.

737
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:38,749
但我们现在了解了这些人的情况
Yeah, but we know about these people

738
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:40,718
也能帮助他们
and can do something about it.

739
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,887
帮助Nadine就意味着犯法
Helping Nadine means breaking the law.

740
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:44,288
那又怎样 我们之前为了做正确的事
So? We've risked breaking the law before

741
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,490
也冒险行走在法律边缘
to do the right thing.

742
00:31:45,492 --> 00:31:47,091
但这次不同 情况不一样
Not like this. This is different.

743
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,960
怎么会 有什么不同
How? How is this different?

744
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,361
如果你非要问
If you have to ask,

745
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:51,596
那说明你没有在理智思考
you're not thinking straight.

746
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:52,997
现在深呼吸
Now take a breath.

747
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:54,499
看来
Seems like

748
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:56,300
我们现在进退两难
we're danged if we do and danged if we don't.

749
00:31:56,302 --> 00:31:58,102
如果我们不做点什么
I mean, if we don't do something,

750
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:00,972
恐怖分子肯定会抢走枪
the terrorists are gonna get their hands on them guns anyway.

751
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:02,773
还可能用它们来对付那些
Yeah, and probably use them against the very people

752
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:03,941
Nadine想要救的人
Nadine's trying to save.

753
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:05,743
Nadine也知道这个情况
Nadine knows we know that, too,

754
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:08,012
可能因此希望我们放了她
probably hoping we'll let her go because of it.

755
00:32:08,014 --> 00:32:09,814
真是进退维谷
It's a catch-22.

756
00:32:09,816 --> 00:32:12,049
好了
All right,

757
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:13,784
我们放她走
we'll let her go.

758
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:17,522
但要跟着她 让她带我们找到枪
But only to follow her so she leads us to the guns.

759
00:32:17,524 --> 00:32:19,257
等等 你是说我们要给她下套吗
Wait, you mean we're gonna trick her?

760
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:22,493
不是下套 是要救她
No, not trying to trick her, trying to save her life

761
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:24,295
同时 不让博科圣地得到那些枪
and keep Boko Haram from getting those guns.

762
00:32:24,297 --> 00:32:27,798
我们只能帮她到这儿了
And that's gonna have to be enough for you.

763
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:30,835
明白了吗
Clear?

764
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:46,745
Nadine正向东走
<i>Nadine's still</i> <i>heading east towards</i>

765
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:48,579
沿着星条大道
<i>Stars and Stripes Boulevard,</i>

766
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:50,381
时速超过限速15英里
<i>going about 15 miles</i> <i>over the speed limit,</i>

767
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:52,216
也许你想把这条也加入指控
in case you want to add that to the charges.

768
00:32:52,218 --> 00:32:53,418
她是去机场吗
Think she's heading to the airport?

769
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,819
希望不是
I hope not,

770
00:32:54,821 --> 00:32:56,287
因为所有光学测距器的单元信号
'cause all the RF and cell signals

771
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,456
都可能破坏你放在她口袋里的追踪器
might screw up the geotracker you put in her coat.

772
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,824
全靠你了 Patton
Counting on you, Patton.

773
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:01,726
我们得离她足够近才能保护她
We got to stay close enough to protect her

774
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:02,927
以防恐怖分子袭击她
in case the terrorists attack,

775
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:04,696
但不能太近 防止她发现我们
but not so close that she spots us.

776
00:33:04,698 --> 00:33:06,397
我想知道他们为什么还没袭击她
I wonder why they haven't attacked her yet.

777
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,899
也许他们已经找到枪了
Maybe they already found the guns,

778
00:33:07,901 --> 00:33:09,701
要是这样的话 他们就不需要跟着她了
and if so, they don't need to follow her.

779
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:11,135
除非他们一开始就不是冲着枪而来
Except they didn't come for the guns first,

780
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:12,537
而是冲着Nadine来的
they came for Nadine.

781
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:15,373
不要担心 我们会保护她的
Don't worry, we're not gonna let anything happen to her.

782
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:18,042
记住 一旦她带我们找到枪
Just remember, as soon as she leads us to the guns,

783
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:20,244
我们就要逮捕Nadine
we got to get Nadine,

784
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:22,080
拿到枪 然后离开
get the guns, and then get out of there.

785
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:23,381
特别是当他们已经找到了枪的情况
Especially if they already found them.

786
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:25,016
他们可能就在那儿等她
They could be lying in wait for her.

787
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:26,718
她从Crofton下去了
She's getting off on Crofton.

788
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,053
可能是去出租的飞机棚
She might be headed to the charter hangars.

789
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:31,255
该死 她的信号中断了
Damn it, her signal's breaking up.

790
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:33,358
我们得拉近距离
We got to close the gap.

791
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:39,497
我不明白这事 Christopher
I don't know about this, Christopher.

792
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:42,266
我还是不敢相信 我们要逮捕她
I still can't believe we're gonna arrest her.

793
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:46,104
King做了决定 我们做好自己的工作就行了
King made the call. Let's just do our jobs.

794
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:57,448
这个集装箱应该已经卸货了
The storage pods were supposed to be unloaded

795
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,717
并且已经在飞机上了 我没法等那么久
and on the plane by now. I can't wait that long.

796
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:01,486
对不起 Nadine 但我们得推迟
I'm sorry, Nadine, but we got delayed

797
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:02,520
到达机场
getting to the airport.

798
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:04,956
等等 有些不对劲
Wait. Something's happened.

799
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:06,257
枪在哪儿
Where are the guns?

800
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:08,026
你什么意思 什么枪在哪儿
What do you mean, where are the guns?

801
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:09,460
Nadine 怎么了
Nadine, what's wrong?

802
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:10,895
一切都还好吗
Is everything okay?

803
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:12,597
Nadine Nadine
Nadine? Nadine!

804
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,302
嘿
Hey!

805
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:20,405
你在干什么
What are you doing...

806
00:34:45,732 --> 00:34:47,498
Nadine 停下
Nadine, stop!

807
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,499
你跟踪我
You followed me.

808
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:50,168
是的 而且又一次救了你的命
Yeah, and saved your life again.

809
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:53,337
-跑去候机楼 -我得跑的更远一些
- Run to the terminal. - I'm gonna run farther than that.

810
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,339
博科圣地会为了这事儿报复村民的
Boko Haram's gonna retaliate against the villagers for this.

811
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:58,709
如果我没法把枪给他们 至少让我警示他们
If I can't get them guns, at least let me warn them,

812
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:00,011
让他们离开
move them.

813
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:03,648
我有办法
I have the means.

814
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,750
如果你允许 我可以很快离开这个国家
I can easily leave the country if you let me.

815
00:35:05,752 --> 00:35:07,685
对不起 Nadine 我不能
No, I'm sorry, Nadine, I can't.

816
00:35:07,687 --> 00:35:09,687
拜托了
Please.

817
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:25,937
Percy 你没事吧
Percy, you good?

818
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:42,220
Nadine怎么样了
How's Nadine?

819
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,725
她去哪儿了
Where is she?

820
00:35:49,562 --> 00:35:50,962
她 她跑了
Sh-She got away.

821
00:35:50,964 --> 00:35:53,331
陪着他
Stay with him.

822
00:36:04,778 --> 00:36:07,479
我想知道今天外面发生了些什么
I want to know what happened out there today.

823
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:09,514
我已经告诉你我知道的了 Pride
I told you what I know, Pride.

824
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:12,617
你告诉了我 你想让我知道的
You told me what you want me to know.

825
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:14,919
Nadine不可能在你手下跑了
No way Nadine got away from you.

826
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:17,856
见鬼了 Sonja
Damn it, Sonja,

827
00:36:17,858 --> 00:36:21,793
Brody走后 我努力重建这支队伍
I worked too hard to rebuild this team after Brody left.

828
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:23,128
比以前更强大了
Stronger than ever.

829
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,831
你怎么可以冒险把这一切都毁了呢
How could you be so willing to risk throwing it all away?

830
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,751
这个队伍对你的意义 不比别人少吧
This team means as much, if not more, to you than to anybody.

831
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:30,666
这知道
I know that.

832
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,650
那你为什么不告诉我到底发生了什么
Then why the hell won't you tell me what happened?

833
00:36:33,306 --> 00:36:35,106
有什么区别呢
What difference does it make?

834
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:37,075
我们抓到了恐怖分子 对吗
We got the terrorists, didn't we?

835
00:36:37,077 --> 00:36:38,576
还有枪支
And the guns.

836
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,078
Nadine不是坏人
Nadine is not the bad guy.

837
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,213
那怎么那么多执法部门
Then how come half of law enforcement's

838
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:44,282
仍然在外面找她
still out there looking for her?

839
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:52,524
如果我告诉你了 Pride 任何这间办公室之外的人
If I told you, Pride, and anybody outside of this office

840
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:54,092
发现了真相
found out,

841
00:36:54,094 --> 00:36:55,860
你也会有麻烦的
you would get in trouble, too.

842
00:36:55,862 --> 00:36:57,328
我不能让这一切发生
I can't let that happen.

843
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,863
我已经陷入麻烦了
I'm already in trouble.

844
00:36:58,865 --> 00:37:01,232
为了这事我牺牲了抓捕Hamilton的机会
I sacrificed Hamilton for this.

845
00:37:01,234 --> 00:37:03,735
天知道他会怎么报复
God only knows how he's gonna retaliate.

846
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:08,206
这很严重 Sonja
This is serious, Sonja.

847
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:12,977
不仅仅是法律问题
Not just legally.

848
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:16,247
你不能报喜不报忧
You cannot cherry-pick which orders to follow--

849
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:17,716
至少在我眼皮底下不行
not on my watch.

850
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:19,350
这不是一支队伍应该有的
That is not what a team is.

851
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:20,752
我也不会支持你
And I won't stand for it.

852
00:37:20,754 --> 00:37:23,722
我们之前就已经谈过了
And we've had this conversation before.

853
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:28,760
Nadine到底怎么了
What happened to Nadine?

854
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:42,340
对不起
I'm sorry.

855
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:44,509
我不能说
I can't.

856
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:52,050
就这样吧
That'll be all.

857
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:04,562
嘿
Hey.

858
00:38:04,564 --> 00:38:07,065
嘿
Hey.

859
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,500
你在等我吗
You waited for me?

860
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:10,735
我有些担心
Well, I was a little worried.

861
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:12,871
一切都好吗
Everything all right?

862
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,440
我不知道
I don't know.

863
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,776
Pride很生气
Pride is pretty pissed.

864
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:20,712
我不能怪他
Can't say I blame him.

865
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:23,515
我 但我不知道他会做什么
And I... I don't know what he's gonna do yet.

866
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:25,717
什么意思 做什么
What does that mean? Do what?

867
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,187
我不知道他会不会向总部举报我
I don't know if he's gonna report me to HQ.

868
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:31,222
King不会这么做的
King's not gonna do that.

869
00:38:31,224 --> 00:38:32,857
他知道这样你就完了
He knows you'll be done for.

870
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:36,628
是啊 可我说了 他非常生气
Yeah, like I said, he's pretty pissed.

871
00:38:38,732 --> 00:38:40,698
你告诉他究竟发生了什么吗
Well, did you tell him what really happened?

872
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,967
什么 你也想知道么
What, you're trying to find out, too?

873
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,605
不相信我吗
Don't you trust me?

874
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:52,577
你有吃醋吗
Were you jealous?

875
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:56,981
在咖啡店的男人
Guy in the coffee shop.

876
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:59,918
这有什么联系呢
Now, what does that got to do with...

877
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,453
啊 你不能指望我相信你
Ah, you can't expect me to trust you

878
00:39:02,455 --> 00:39:04,322
如果你不相信我 对吗
if you don't trust me, right?

879
00:39:06,226 --> 00:39:09,761
好吧 老实说 我不知道我什么感觉
Well, honestly, I don't know what I felt.

880
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:12,530
我
I...

881
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:15,166
可能有一点点的吃醋吧
Maybe I could have been a little jealous.

882
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:19,838
那也许我可能让Nadine跑了
And maybe I could have let Nadine go.

883
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:25,109
听着 我不需要你给我讲道理 Christopher
Hey, look, I don't need a lecture from you, Christopher,

884
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:28,346
我也不想让这事影响到你
and I don't want this to bite you in the ass later,

885
00:39:28,348 --> 00:39:29,948
所以拜托了
so please,

886
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,483
别问我任何问题了好吗
don't ask me any more questions, okay?

887
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,220
好的
Okay.

888
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:38,223
走吧 我们离开这儿
Come on, let's get out of here.

889
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:41,192
Percy
Percy.

890
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:46,164
刚和助理检察官Lzzo通了电话
Just got off the phone with Assistant U.S. Attorney Izzo.

891
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:49,534
法官想让我们现在就去市中心
Judge wants us both downtown now.

892
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,113
证据明显
The evidence clearly contradicts

893
00:40:02,115 --> 00:40:04,148
和Percy探员在法庭上的证词相违背
Agent Percy's statement to the court.

894
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,650
你撒谎了
You lied.

895
00:40:05,652 --> 00:40:07,485
没有 是这样
No. See...

896
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:10,355
当时队伍正处在枪战之中 我...
the team was in the middle of a firefight. I...

897
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:12,657
你在你宣誓过的证词中
You said in your sworn statement,

898
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:15,894
是这么说的"Nadine Bancroft逃跑了"
and I quote, “Nadine Bancroft got away.”

899
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:19,330
明显地 你本可以在那个时候逮捕她
Clearly, you could have arrested her right then and there.

900
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:21,165
在你回到队伍之前 把她逮捕
Cuffed her before you went back in.

901
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,668
我担心我的队伍
I was worried about my team.

902
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:26,838
我做了主观决定
I made a judgment call.

903
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,139
你让一个重罪犯逃跑了
You let a felon escape.

904
00:40:28,141 --> 00:40:30,875
好的 等等
Okay, hold on.

905
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:33,945
单纯出于好奇
Just out of curiosity...

906
00:40:33,947 --> 00:40:36,214
是什么让你去看监控的
what made you think to look for surveillance?

907
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:37,515
这不是重点
That's not the point.

908
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:39,684
这更像是报复而不是追求正义
It is if this is more about retribution than justice.

909
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,620
你是在宽恕你探员的行为吗 Pride探员
Are you condoning your agent's behavior, Agent Pride?

910
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:45,556
我不宽恕以莫须有罪名进行政治迫害
I'm not condoning a witch hunt, if that's what you're asking.

911
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:47,992
你俩到底在说什么
What the hell are you two talking about?

912
00:40:47,994 --> 00:40:50,862
尊敬的法官大人 Pride探员和Hamilton市长
Your Honor, Agent Pride and Mayor Hamilton

913
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:52,163
相处的不是很愉快
don't exactly get along.

914
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:53,698
那又和这事有什么关系
And what does that have to do with this?

915
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,434
因为市长听说发生的事情之后
Because when the mayor heard about what happened,

916
00:40:56,436 --> 00:40:59,337
他叫了督察长开始新的调查
he asked the inspector general to open an investigation.

917
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:01,906
报复我调查他的事儿
Retribution for my investigating him.

918
00:41:01,908 --> 00:41:03,741
-纯属推测 -说的跟真的一样
- Conjecture. - Like hell it is!

919
00:41:03,743 --> 00:41:04,742
够了
Enough.

920
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:06,311
你们俩可以晚些继续吵
You two can argue about this later.

921
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:08,379
但这没有改变事实
But it doesn't change the facts.

922
00:41:09,482 --> 00:41:11,616
你有大麻烦了 年轻的女士
You're in serious trouble, young lady.

923
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:12,750
因为在我眼里
Because as far as I'm concerned,

924
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:14,786
你没有说实话
you're not telling me the truth.

925
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:17,588
你有最后一次机会
You have one last chance.

926
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,792
我想知道你为什么没有逮捕 Nadine Bancroft
I want to know why you didn't arrest Nadine Bancroft,

927
00:41:20,794 --> 00:41:22,860
我想知道她在哪儿
and I want to know where she is,

928
00:41:22,862 --> 00:41:25,196
否则我要判你伪证罪
or I'm gonna charge you with perjury

929
00:41:25,198 --> 00:41:27,732
以及轻视法庭
and hold you in contempt.

930
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,667
你明白吗
Do you understand?

931
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:36,975
Karen Karen 等等 等等
Karen, Karen, come on, come on.

932
00:41:36,977 --> 00:41:39,143
你为什么这么做
Why are you doing this?

933
00:41:39,145 --> 00:41:40,378
别怪我 Dwayne
Don't blame me, Dwayne.

934
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,846
你探员自找的
Your agent brought this on herself.

935
00:41:41,848 --> 00:41:43,314
我只是做本职工作
I'm just doing my job.

936
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:45,450
是啊 更像是执行Hamilton的命令
Yeah, more like doing Hamilton's bidding.

937
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:47,952
没想到你也是和市长同一阵营的
Didn't realize that you were in the mayor's pocket, too.

938
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:49,153
你知道这不是真的
You know that's not true.

939
00:41:49,155 --> 00:41:50,188
是吗
Do I?

940
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,422
底线是
Bottom line:

941
00:41:51,424 --> 00:41:53,658
你的探员搞砸了 Hamilton反扑了
your agent screwed up, and Hamilton pounced.

942
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,728
我警告过你 如果他发现窃听一事的后果
I warned you what would happen if he found out about the wire.

943
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,029
没什么我能做的
There's nothing I could do.

944
00:41:58,031 --> 00:41:59,364
这不是真的
That's not true.

945
00:41:59,366 --> 00:42:03,634
你让他开了场 现在你必须接受事实
You gave him the opening, now you have to live with it.

946
00:42:06,973 --> 00:42:09,040
刚发生了什么 King
What just happened, King?

947
00:42:09,776 --> 00:42:11,009
Percy呢
Where's Percy?

948
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:17,648
他们要带她去监狱
They're taking her to jail.
