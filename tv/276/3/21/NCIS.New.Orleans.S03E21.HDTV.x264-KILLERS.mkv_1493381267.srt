請求支援 紅色警報 發生交火
Dispatch! Signal red! Shots fired!

2
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:36,163
發生交火
Shots fired!

3
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:48,008
多名嫌疑人 把所有人都派來
Multiple suspects! Send everybody!

4
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:14,334
嘿 你中槍了嗎
Hey, you shot?

5
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:15,602
我不知道
I don't know.

6
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:17,137
我想我沒事
I don't think so.

7
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:18,959
剛剛到底發生了什麼
What the hell just happened?

我的電腦呢
What about my computer?

17
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,174
那個 網絡攝像頭還是什麼的
The... the webcam or whatever it's called.

18
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,843
我是說 他們能不能黑進去
I mean, c-can't they hack into that

19
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:59,145
在我不知情的情況下偷拍我
and record me without my knowing?

20
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:00,847
我們已經採取了防入侵措施 市長先生
We've already disabled it, Mr. Mayor.

21
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,515
你的筆記本電腦和手機也是
Same with your laptop and cell.

22
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:04,417
你們確定沒問題了嗎 因為
Yeah. You sure about that? 'Cause, uh,

23
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,620
我不想再有什麼漏洞 我的麻煩已經夠多了
I don't need no more leaks. I got enough problems.

24
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:08,855
要知道 有些人不遺餘力地
Certain people try to bring me down

25
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:11,157
想扳倒我
any way they can, you know?

26
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,827
我們接下來會檢查您的車子和家裏
We'll scan your car and home next.

27
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,196
目前為止 這個房間是安全的
But, for now, this room's secure.

28
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:18,365
好的 電話也安全嗎
Good. Phones, too?

29
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,733
呃 別用座機
Uh, don't use landlines.

30
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,468
但如果你的助理發現 聽筒裏有回音或敲擊聲
But make sure your assistant lets you know

31
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,969
讓她一定要告訴你
if she hears any echoes or clicks.

32
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:24,471
有可能是線路竊聽
Could mean a wiretap.

33
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:26,506
如果真的是竊聽 我們應該可以追查到源頭
And, if so, we should be able to trace its source.

34
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:27,874
手機呢 沒問題嗎
What about cell phones-- they good?

35
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,242
手機沒問題
Cell's good.

36
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:32,412
好的 那我們也沒問題了
All right. We're good, then.

37
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:33,880
兩千 是嗎
2,000, right?

38
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,615
不必了 我們會給你寄賬單
Uh, that's okay, we'll just bill you.

39
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:37,050
不 不行
Uh, no. No, no.

40
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:38,451
不要賬單
No bills.

41
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:40,553
這事只有你我知道 明白嗎
It's between us, you understand?

42
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:41,755
明白了
Understood.

43
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:43,690
好的
Okay.

44
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:51,331
-你好 -Frank 我是Hamilton
- Hello? - Frank, it's Hamilton.

45
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,066
你確定這條線沒問題嗎
Are you sure this line is secure?

46
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:54,768
說實話 我現在對什麼都不確定了
Honestly, I'm not sure about anything anymore.

47
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,469
讓我非常困擾
Gotten in pretty deep here.

48
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:58,905
你也不該感到確定 市長先生 因為我
Nor should you be, Mr. Mayor, 'cause I'm gonna be

49
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:00,840
就站在你跟前 寶貝兒
up and in your grill, baby.

50
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:03,977
他都清理過手機了 我們怎麼還能竊聽他
How can we still hear him if they swept his cell?

51
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:07,447
你是無法清理3P的影子應用的
You can't sweep a Triple P shadow app,

52
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,983
這個應用讓我能竊聽並錄下
which allows me to listen to and record

53
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:12,953
聽得見的任何聲音
any and everything within earshot.

54
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:15,055
問題在於 不是所有事情
Problem is, anything and everything isn't covered

55
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:16,690
都在竊聽令的許可範圍
under the wiretap warrant.

56
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:18,491
只能是關於清水市
Only what's related to Clearwater

57
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:20,727
或者他所謂的海外行賄基金
or his alleged offshore slush funds.

58
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:22,062
還有Javier Garcia的謀殺案
And Javier Garcia's murder.

59
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:23,530
告訴Jess
Let Jess know,

60
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:26,066
我這段時間不能見她了
uh, I won't be seeing her for a while.

61
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:28,868
不能冒險讓媒體再挖出什麼緋聞了
Can't risk the media finding out about any more of these affairs.

62
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,705
-停止錄音 -等等 什麼
- Stop recording. - Wait, what?

63
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:33,239
私人信息
Personal information is not covered

64
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,075
不在竊聽範圍之內
under the scope of the wiretap.

65
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:37,744
聽著 Dwayne 如果不能嚴格按照要求執行
Look, Dwayne, if this isn't done within the strict parameters

66
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:39,813
在法庭上是站不住腳的
of the order, it won't stand up in court.

67
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:42,048
市長並不乾淨 Karen
Mayor's dirty, Karen.

68
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,484
Rita讓這個案子正式成立了
Look, Rita's put together a solid circumstantial case,

69
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:47,153
但是Jenkins... 他是唯一一個願意
but Jenkins-- he was the only judge willing to risk

70
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:50,156
冒險跟Hamilton對立 同意竊聽的法官
going up against Hamilton to grant the tap.

71
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,158
我知道你們有多想扳倒他
I know how bad you want to take him down,

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,994
但如果你們不按法律條文辦事
but if you don't do this by the book,

73
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,362
你們會失去竊聽許可
you're gonna blow the wiretap.

74
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:57,630
Hamilton就會從謀殺案脫身
And Hamilton gets away with murder.

75
00:03:57,632 --> 00:03:59,666
還有其它案件
And everything else.

76
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,136
停止錄音
Stop recording.

77
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,174
好了 我有案子了
Ah, all right, I got a case.

78
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:09,843
繼續監視市長
Keep monitoring the mayor.

79
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:12,479
你確定Patton知道監聽的關鍵字嗎
Are you sure Patton knows what keywords to listen for?

80
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:13,980
他知道清水市案子的
Is he read in on Clearwater,

81
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:15,482
全部細節了嗎
every detail?

82
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:17,350
不 不是全部
No, not everything.

83
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:19,786
那我要是你 我會待在這裏
Then I'd stay put if I were you.

84
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:22,155
拿下Hamilton可能只有這一次機會
May only get this one shot at Hamilton.

85
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:35,035
Pride還好嗎 他聽起來怎麼樣
Yeah, is Pride all right? How'd he sound?

86
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:36,569
糾結
Torn.

87
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:38,004
必須說服他待在那裏
Had to talk him into staying put,

88
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:39,339
集中精力扳倒Hamilton
focusing on trying to get Hamilton

89
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:40,640
在他幹掉我們之前
before Hamilton gets us.

90
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:42,442
是啊 King對工作很忠誠
Yeah, King's loyal to the job.

91
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:45,345
讓他放棄主導案件偵破很不容易
It's not easy for him not taking the lead on a case.

92
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:47,147
所以我們更要把這個案子辦得漂漂亮亮
All the more reason for us to kick ass on this one.

93
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,615
你要我去接Percy嗎
Do you want me to go pick up Percy?

94
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:51,117
不用 我已經在咖啡店這裏了
No, I'm already here at the coffee shop.

95
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,086
我們一會兒在犯罪...
We'll meet you at the crime...

96
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:56,089
現場見
...scene.

97
00:04:57,826 --> 00:04:59,859
Lasalle
Lasalle?

98
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,796
Lasalle 你還在嗎
Lasalle, you still there?

99
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:05,065
是 我還在
Yeah, I'm still here.

100
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,633
一會見
We'll see you in a bit.

101
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:08,535
嗨
Hey!

102
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,036
鄉下鼠
Country Mouse.

103
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,504
早知道是你來接我
If I knew you were my ride,

104
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,440
我會給你帶個羊角麵包
I would've picked you up a croissant.

105
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:17,677
一切還好嗎
Everything all right?

106
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,747
當然 我們出發吧
Yeah, sure. Let's roll.

107
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:34,961
嘿 你確定沒什麼心事嗎
Hey, you sure nothing's bothering you?

108
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:36,796
我嗎 沒啊 怎麼了
Me? No, why?

109
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:38,498
我不知道 也許是因為這一路上
I don't know, maybe 'cause you only said, like,

110
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,533
你只跟我說了兩個字
two words to me on the way over.

111
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,268
是我哎 怎麼回事
Come on, it's me. What?

112
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,603
Gregorio 我們掌握了什麼
Gregorio, what do we got?

113
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:44,938
你也好啊 Christopher
Hello to you, too, Christopher.

114
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,573
哦 姐們兒 他心情不太好
Oh, girl, he is in a mood.

115
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,541
看得出來
I can see that.

116
00:05:48,543 --> 00:05:50,043
搶劫團伙很專業
Heist crew were pros,

117
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:51,845
幹掉了監控 阻斷了通訊
took out cameras, jammed communication,

118
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:54,114
很清楚地知道他們想要的東西是什麼 在哪裏
knew exactly what they were after and where to get it.

119
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:55,849
Sebastian 貨物是什麼
Sebastian, what's the haul?

120
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,884
運往Fort Bragg基地的幾百個MP5衝鋒鎗
Couple hundred MP5s headed to Fort Bragg.

121
00:05:57,886 --> 00:05:59,519
海軍還在清查庫存
The Navy's still doing an inventory

122
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,187
以獲知準確數目 不過...
to get an exact count, but...

123
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,656
那可是大批量的重火力武器
That's a lot of serious firepower.

124
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,892
我是說 這不可能只是為了
I mean, this can't just be about selling them

125
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:07,360
到黑市上去賣吧
on the black market.

126
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:09,062
我們遇到了民兵組織之類的嗎
We're dealing with some kind of militia?

127
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:11,064
不管他們是誰 都是有備而來的
Well, whoever it was, they came prepared.

128
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,867
根據鐵路警察的說法 他們都有防彈衣
According to the railway cops, they all had body armor,

129
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,969
用的是AR-15突擊步槍 震盪手雷
were using AR-15s, concussive grenades.

130
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:17,337
有多少人受傷
How many were injured?

131
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,571
怪就怪在這兒 沒人受傷
That's the thing-- none.

132
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:22,475
哇 搶劫團伙用了AR-15突擊步槍 手雷
Whoa. Heist crew using AR-15s, grenades,

133
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:26,045
帶著MP5衝鋒鎗逃跑 竟然沒一個警察中槍
making off with MP5s, and no cop gets shot?

134
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,381
不 警察們被射擊了 但射中他們的不是子彈
Oh, no, cops were shot all right, just not with bullets.

135
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:29,749
沒錯 不是致命的子彈
Yeah, not with lethal rounds.

136
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,117
而是橡膠子彈
With rubber bullets.

137
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,352
專門設計的複合材料
Specifically designed composite,

138
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:33,686
就像中了一記重拳一樣
packs a heck of a punch,

139
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:35,221
尤其是用AR-15射出來
especially coming out of an AR-15.

140
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,190
能打得你喘不過氣來
It's more than enough to knock the wind out of you.

141
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:39,259
-但不會死人 -那麼問題來了
- But not kill. - Which begs the question,

142
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:41,461
什麼樣的搶劫團伙 去偷上百個致命武器
what kind of heist crew steals hundreds of lethal weapons

143
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:43,129
會帶非致命武器呢
using nonlethal rounds?

144
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:44,531
是啊 這說不通
Yeah. Doesn't make sense.

145
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:45,899
是的 但幸虧鐵路警察
Yeah, well, fortunately the rail cops

146
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:47,534
用的是真子彈
were using live ammo.

147
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:50,570
他們打中了一個團伙成員
They tagged one of the crew.

148
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:53,173
流了不少血 我應該能通過DNA查明身份
Lost a lot of blood. I should be able to get a DNA I.D.

149
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:54,908
好的 有發現就告訴我們 Sebastian
All right, let us know what you find, Sebastian.

150
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,976
那個有錢人是誰
Who's the fat cat?

151
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,946
槍支製造公司的老闆
Owner of the company that makes the guns,

152
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:01,181
Justus Bancroft
Justus Bancroft.

153
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:02,715
或者說是受害者
Or the victim.

154
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:05,418
慢著 在ATF裏待了那麼多年
Whoa. Spent a lot of years at ATF

155
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:05,418
{\a6}煙酒、火器與爆炸物管理局

156
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,987
看過Bancroft的槍械產品所造成的傷害
seeing the pain Bancroft guns cause.

157
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:10,190
很難把他們當成受害人
Hardly makes them a victim.

158
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,626
打擾一下
Excuse me.

159
00:07:13,628 --> 00:07:16,863
海軍罪案調查處 可以和我聊聊嗎
NCIS. Mind if I get a word?

160
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:19,032
不好意思 請問有什麼問題嗎
Sorry, is there a problem?

161
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:21,134
不 當然沒問題
No, no, no, not at all.

162
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:22,635
只是 呃
It's just that, uh, well,

163
00:07:22,637 --> 00:07:24,604
我們已經把知道的都告訴警察了
we already told the police everything we know.

164
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:26,139
而且我們必須走了
And we have to go.

165
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:28,374
抱歉 請問你是
I'm sorry, who are you?

166
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:29,809
Nadine
Nadine.

167
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:31,244
Bancroft
Bancroft.

168
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:35,148
特別探員Lasalle
Special Agent Lasalle.

169
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,483
我們之後會和警方溝通 但如果你不介意的話...
We'll talk with NOPD afterwards, but if you don't mind...

170
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:41,120
當然不介意 儘管問
No, no, of course, of course. Ask me anything.

171
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:43,156
只不過 呃 我們明天
Well, it's just that, uh, we're hosting

172
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:44,958
要舉辦年度慈善活動
our annual charity event tomorrow.

173
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,761
我倒是覺得幾百支衝鋒鎗不知所蹤
I kind of think a couple hundred missing submachine guns

174
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:50,964
比你們的小派對更重要 不是嗎
trumps your little party, don't you?

175
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,065
Percy
Percy.

176
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:54,901
無意冒犯 但是
No disrespect, but, uh,

177
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:57,470
我們的工作還是要做的 而且槍支數量很多
we got to do our jobs, and that's a lot of guns.

178
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:59,072
對 相信我 我理解
Oh, yeah, trust me, I know.

179
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:01,040
這也不是我們第一次遭遇這種事了
It's not the first time we've been hit, either.

180
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:02,275
你們以前也被搶劫過
You've been robbed before?

181
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:04,911
沒有這麼嚴重 但是有過
Well, not to this extent, but yes.

182
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,980
FBI ATF 他們都
Uh, the FBI, ATF, they both investigated

183
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:09,349
調查過前兩次搶劫 但無功而返
the other two times, and, uh, come up empty.

184
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,784
我很高興沒有警察受傷
I'm just glad none of the police got hurt.

185
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:14,520
三次 這裏面一定有什麼聯繫
Well, third time, there's got to be a connection.

186
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,823
我們會深入調查 並通知你我們的進展
We'll dig into it and let you know what we find.

187
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:18,424
-好的 -我們會和你保持聯繫
- All right. - We'll be in touch.

188
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,493
你隨時可以聯繫我
You, uh, call me anytime.

189
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:22,128
-謝謝 -好了
- Thank you. - All right.

190
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,263
謝謝
Thanks.

191
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,500
我覺得King
I don't think King

192
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:29,736
不會喜歡你對她說話的態度
would've much liked the way you talked to her.

193
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:32,238
我還不喜歡你對我說話的態度呢
Don't much like the way you talked to me.

194
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,840
她的反應就好像這一切
She acted like this was nothing more

195
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:36,209
只是些麻煩而已
than an inconvenience.

196
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:37,944
你不覺得奇怪嗎
That didn't bother you?

197
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,979
哦 我忘了
Oh, I forgot,

198
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:42,682
你對什麼都無所謂
nothing's bothering you.

199
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,117
對吧
Right.

200
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,057
在我的辦公桌上工作還自在嗎
Making yourself at home at my desk?

201
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,659
哦 Pride 不 不 抱歉
Oh, Pride, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

202
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:53,960
我就是 我不想
I just, I didn't want to

203
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:55,628
-打擾你和Patton -沒事 Sebastian
- bother you and Patton. - It's okay, Sebastian.

204
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,196
開個玩笑 坐吧
Just teasing. Sit down.

205
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:00,566
能和你換位置再高興不過了 真的
Be more than happy to trade places with you, believe me.

206
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:02,502
坐在竊聽設備旁有點兒無聊吧
Sitting on a wiretap's kind of boring, huh?

207
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:03,770
不如說是單調乏味
More like tedious.

208
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:05,438
而且 我知道了越來越多
Plus, I'm learning more about Hamilton

209
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,907
壓根不想知道的Hamilton的事 太多了
than I ever wanted to know. A lot more.

210
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:10,943
但沒能把他和謀殺案或清水市聯繫起來嗎
But nothing that connects him to the murders or Clearwater?

211
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:12,612
還沒有
Not yet.

212
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:13,613
但這只是
But it's just

213
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:14,881
時間問題
a matter of time.

214
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:16,482
案子進展怎麼樣了
Where are you on the case?

215
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:19,152
用我在犯罪現場找到的DNA
Well, using the DNA I found at the crime scene,

216
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:21,087
我嘗試確認傷者的身份
I'm trying to I.D. our wounded bad guy,

217
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:22,255
但迄今為止 一無所獲
but nothing's coming up so far,

218
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:23,790
這個 有點兒奇怪
which is, you know, a little odd.

219
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:25,558
好的 但並非異常
Okay. But not unusual.

220
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,993
我剛和FBI打完電話
I just got off the phone with FBI,

221
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:28,928
看了之前的搶劫記錄 他們也沒有任何發現
checked on the prior heists, and they got nothing, either.

222
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,730
難以置信
Well, that's hard to believe.

223
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:32,632
三起搶劫大案 沒有一點證據
Three high-profile hits, no evidence.

224
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:33,933
這怎麼可能呢
How's that possible?

225
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:35,401
更奇怪的是 以前被偷的槍
Even stranger, none of the past stolen guns

226
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:37,003
沒有一支出現在街頭或者黑市
have showed up on the street or black market.

227
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:38,237
它們就像消失了一樣
It's as if they just disappeared.

228
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:41,240
也許我該和你們一起調查的
Yeah, maybe I should get involved.

229
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:42,508
不行 Hamilton知道你在查他
No, Hamilton knows you're after him.

230
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,910
你現在不能鬆懈 這太重要了
You can't let up now. It's too important.

231
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,878
幾百支失蹤的槍也很重要
So is a couple hundred missing guns.

232
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
哦 怪不得我一直匹配不上
Oh, no wonder I didn't get a match.

233
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:51,184
我把查找的罪犯性別設置成了男性 而不是女性
I programmed the I.D. search for bad guys, not bad girls.

234
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:52,118
這是性別歧視 順便說一下
That's male bias, by the way.

235
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,486
我為此道歉
I apologize for that.

236
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:55,955
Josephine Bellacroix
Uh, Josephine Bellacroix.

237
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:57,290
中尉 新奧爾良出生
First Lieutenant, born in New Orleans.

238
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,358
海軍陸戰隊員嗎
A Marine?

239
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,726
對 而且檔案非常乾淨
Yeah, flawless record, too.

240
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:02,762
她去過索馬裏和蘇丹
She did a tour in Somalia and Sudan.

241
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:04,297
一年前離開了軍隊
Left the Corps a year ago.

242
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,466
剛好在第一次劫案發生前
Just before the first heist.

243
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:08,501
不知道是什麼讓她開始偷槍的
Wonder what made her start stealing guns.

244
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:10,403
帶她回來 查清楚
Pick her up, find out.

245
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:11,738
-在你去之前... -好的 我先給Lasalle打電話
- And before you do that... - All right, I'll call Lasalle.

246
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,172
他和Sonja還在值外勤
He and Sonja are still in the field.

247
00:10:13,174 --> 00:10:15,341
Sebastian 著手調查她的同事
Sebastian, start looking for known associates,

248
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:16,511
看能不能找到她的同夥
see if we can find out who she's working with.

249
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:17,611
這就查
I'm on it.

250
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:19,045
嘿
Hey.

251
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,814
我們可以的 不要擔心
We got this. Don't worry about us.

252
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:35,161
如果你一直對我採取沉默的方式
If you're gonna keep giving me the silent treatment

253
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:36,629
來折磨我
and being mean to me...

254
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:38,097
我沒折磨你
I'm not being mean to you.

255
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,566
好吧 那是怎麼回事
Okay, so what's your problem?

256
00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:42,802
我不明白
I don't understand.

257
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:45,004
我就是對今早的事情很吃驚
I was just surprised this morning,

258
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:47,673
看到你和那個人在咖啡館
seeing you with that guy at the coffee shop.

259
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:50,343
等等 Tom嗎
Wait, Tom?

260
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:52,245
我不知道你在跟人約會
I didn't know you were dating anybody.

261
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,647
我沒在約會
I'm not dating anybody.

262
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:56,082
只是喝咖啡而已
It was just coffee.

263
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:57,784
再說 我一點都不瞭解他
Besides, I barely know that guy.

264
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:59,819
你已經瞭解到可以親他了
Well, you knew him well enough to kiss him.

265
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:02,422
我沒親他 是他親的我
I didn't kiss-- he kissed me.

266
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:06,993
你是在吃醋嗎
Are you jealous?

267
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:08,694
吃醋
Jealous.

268
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:10,663
-你吃醋了 -你發什麼瘋呢
- You're jealous. - You're trippin' girl.

269
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:13,099
快點 準備武器
Come on. Let's gear up.

270
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:28,114
散彈鎗 不是吧
Shotguns? Really?

271
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:29,715
受傷的陸戰隊員
Yeah, wounded Marine.

272
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:32,418
她手裏應該有一把MP5衝鋒鎗
She's probably armed with a MP5 by now.

273
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,187
還是小心點好
Better safe than sorry.

274
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:39,225
聯邦探員
Federal agents!

275
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,898
Percy
Percy.

276
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:55,808
這不可能只是搶劫中的槍
No way that's just from the heist shooting.

277
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,393
街對面的房子裝有安全監控
House across the street has a security camera,

278
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:09,161
但攝像頭的角度難以確定
but it's a bad angle to I.D. anyone

279
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:11,197
進出Bellacroix房子的人的身份
going in and out of Bellacroix's place.

280
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:14,233
所以沒人拿著MP5衝鋒鎗走出來嗎
Ooh, so no one walking out with an MP5?

281
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,435
有個拿著小包的女士 就這樣
Lady carrying a small bag. That's about it.

282
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:17,703
這看起來越來越像
It's looking more and more like

283
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:19,605
那個團伙為了掩蓋蹤跡幹掉了她
the crew took her out to cover their tracks.

284
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:22,542
找個兇狠的傢伙把自己人幹掉
Takes a pretty vicious crew to take out one of their own.

285
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:23,809
我們得查出他們是誰
We need to find out who they are

286
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,811
這樣才能盡快找回那些槍
so we can get those guns back, fast.

287
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:28,114
問題是 他們在掩蓋行蹤上做得太好了
The problem is, they're so good at covering their tracks,

288
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:29,582
我們什麼都沒查到
we got squat.

289
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:33,052
要是我們能查清楚 一開始是什麼讓一個光榮的陸戰隊員
Yeah. If we could just figure out what made a decorated Marine

290
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:35,121
加入一個搶劫團伙
join a heist crew in the first place.

291
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:37,123
你確定在她的服役記錄中
Are you sure there weren't any red flags

292
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,324
沒有任何危險信號嗎
in her service record?

293
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,359
沒有創傷後應激障礙 沒有心理恐慌
No PTSD, no psych alarm.

294
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:43,262
她的同事中是否有犯罪記錄
Any of her known associates with criminal backgrounds?

295
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,699
沒有 Bellacroix是新奧爾良本地人
No. Bellacroix's a NOLA native,

296
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,699
路易斯安那州立大學研究生 名列前茅
LSU grad, top of her class.

297
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:48,434
說了吧 什麼都查不到
Like I said, squat.

298
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:52,305
聽我說 我知道監聽Hamilton比什麼都重要
Look, I know the Hamilton wire is important and everything,

299
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:54,574
但也許是時候讓Pride參與進來了
but think maybe it's time to loop Pride in?

300
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:58,077
King希望我們能找到線索
King's expecting us to find leads.

301
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:01,347
繼續調查吧
Let's keep digging.

302
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:03,716
好吧
All right.

303
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:08,654
嘿 大家好
Hey, guys.

304
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:10,590
天啊 回到這裏看著你們在那邊
Oh, man, it's so weird being back here

305
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:11,991
感覺好奇怪
and seeing you guys there.

306
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:15,528
這種感覺就像是"我以為自己離開了 他們又把我拉回去..."
It's like, 「Just when I thought I was out, they pulled...」

307
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:15,528
{\a6}原文：Just when I thought I was out,they pull me back in

308
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,264
是《教父3》裏Michael Corleone的台詞
It's Michael Corleone, from, uh, from <i>The Godfather 3.</i>

309
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:23,302
我的屏幕好像... 卡住了
Guys, I think my... my screen froze.

310
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,904
說說被害者的彈道分析
Ballistics on the victim, please.

311
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:26,238
對 好的
Right, sure.

312
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,274
死者身上的彈道模式表明
Well, the bullet pattern on our dead Marine

313
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:31,010
13發子彈全部來自於MP5衝鋒鎗
suggests that all 13 bullets came from an MP5.

314
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,778
要我說 那真是槍林彈雨
Which, if you ask me, that's overkill.

315
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,548
更有理由懷疑 是她的同夥殺了她
Even more reason to suspect her crew took her out.

316
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,716
即使如此 還是有些地方對不上
Still, something doesn't add up.

317
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:38,618
他們搶劫的時候用的是橡皮子彈
They went out of their way to use rubber bullets

318
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,186
現在卻用真的子彈
for the heist, but then use real bullets

319
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:41,420
去殺自己人嗎
to kill one of their own?

320
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:44,023
或許他們知道 殺警察會被判處死刑
Maybe they knew killing cops guarantees the needle.

321
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:47,059
但如果他們把其中一把槍變成了殺人兇器
Yeah, but if any of those guns end up as the murder weapon,

322
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,327
他們還是會被判處死刑
they'll get the needle anyway.

323
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,895
我們漏掉了什麼
We're missing something.

324
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,931
嗨 那些橡膠子彈有什麼發現嗎
Hey, did you get anything on those rubber bullets yet?

325
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,367
你們讓我驗屍完
You wanted me to call

326
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,769
馬上給你們打電話
as soon as the autopsy was completed.

327
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:58,170
哇 嘿 醫生
Whoa. Hey, Doc.

328
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,106
簡直了 這就跟從前一樣
This is so crazy, it's like old times.

329
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:01,874
你 我 血漿
You, me, plasmas.

330
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,476
我不知道你在你的實驗室 Sebastian
I didn't know you were in your lab, Sebastian.

331
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:05,011
你怎麼沒來打招呼呢
Why didn't you say something?

332
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:06,912
我知道當你忙於解剖抽不開身的時候
Well, I know better than to bother you

333
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,781
還是不要打擾你為好
when you're elbow deep in liver.

334
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:10,116
抱歉打斷你們
I hate to interrupt.

335
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:11,951
驗屍結果 對
Autopsy results, right.

336
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:13,319
好吧 不出所料
Okay, no surprises.

337
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:16,255
死因是多處槍傷
C.O.D.: multiple gunshot wounds.

338
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:19,759
子彈擊中了每個重要的動脈和器官
The bullets hit every major artery and organ,

339
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,560
擊中其中任何一個部位都足以致死
and any one of them would've sufficed.

340
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:25,297
這顯然是一起聲明性的謀殺
This was obviously a statement killing.

341
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,767
好讓其他成員乖乖聽話
One way to keep the rest of the crew in line.

342
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:29,535
但是 有一個異常
However, there is an anomaly.

343
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:32,071
在Bellacroix女士被殺之前
Before Ms. Bellacroix was murdered,

344
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:34,840
有人縫合了她在搶劫時
someone sutured the initial gunshot wound

345
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,676
由鐵路警察造成的
inflicted by the railway officer

346
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,144
初始槍傷
during the heist.

347
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:39,679
甚至取出了子彈
Even removed the bullet.

348
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:42,915
等等 他們要殺她 為什麼還要救她
Wait, why would they try to save her only to kill her?

349
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,417
這根本說不通啊
That doesn't make any sense.

350
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:46,952
尤其是當你知道 他們還給她
Especially when you factor in that they gave her

351
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:50,990
用了廣譜抗病毒藥物 來預防感染
broad-spectrum prophylaxis to fight infection.

352
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:52,858
移除了子彈 還進行了縫合
Bullet removal, sutures,

353
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,193
抗生素 這必須由
antibiotics-- I mean, this has to

354
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:55,861
一名醫生來完成 是嗎
have been done by a doctor, right?

355
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:57,296
有可能
Maybe.

356
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:58,798
但她並沒有去過醫院
But she didn't go to a hospital.

357
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,634
那個提著包的女人
The lady with the bag.

358
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:03,169
Sebastian 你跟他們說了
Sebastian, did you tell them about

359
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,303
橡膠子彈的事嗎
the rubber bullets yet?

360
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:06,072
沒 還沒有
No, not yet.

361
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:07,173
是這樣 各地警察都一直希望
So, um, police everywhere have been

362
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:08,240
越來越多地使用
looking to use more and more

363
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,408
非致命性子彈
nonlethal ammo.

364
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,143
這對槍支製造商來說是個發財的機會
It's been a real boon for gun manufacturers.

365
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:14,246
幸運的是 每個製造橡膠子彈的公司
Fortunately, each company that makes rubber bullets

366
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,482
都有自己專門的設計 所以
uses its own proprietary design, so,

367
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:19,485
搶劫團伙使用的子彈
the bullets used by the heist crew

368
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,487
實際上是Bancroft的子彈
are actually Bancroft bullets.

369
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:24,790
用Bancroft的子彈來偷Bancroft的槍嗎
Bancroft bullets used to steal Bancroft guns?

370
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,959
我可能找到了另一個與Bancroft的聯繫
I might've found another Bancroft connection.

371
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,295
抱歉 醫生 我要把屏幕給另一名醫生了
Sorry, Doc, I need the screen for another doc.

372
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:32,598
Emma Miller 一名無國界醫生
Emma Miller, a Doctors Without Borders physician,

373
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,033
檔案顯示 也是Bellacroix的醫生
also Bellacroix's doctor of record.

374
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:35,768
她們一起在新奧爾良長大
They grew up in New Orleans together

375
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,237
同一時間從路易斯安納州立大學畢業
and graduated LSU at the same time.

376
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,606
這說得通 Bellacroix會找一名醫生朋友
Which makes sense Bellacroix would call a doctor friend

377
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,302
來幫她縫合 且不會出賣她
to stitch her up without ratting her out.

378
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:42,943
嗯
Mm-hmm.

379
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:46,345
我們需要找到Miller醫生 看看她怎麼說
Yeah, we need to find Dr. Miller and see what she has to say.

380
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:47,646
與Bancroft的聯繫是什麼
What's the Bancroft connection?

381
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:49,515
非常大的關係 Miller醫生是
A big one. Dr. Miller sits on the board

382
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:52,551
新奧爾良Bancroft家族基金會的董事會成員
of the Bancroft Family Foundation of New Orleans.

383
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:55,421
也就是說 她現在可能正在參加慈善舞會
Which means that she could be at that charity shindig right now.

384
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:57,356
Bancroft的子彈 槍支和朋友
Bancroft bullets, guns and friends.

385
00:15:57,358 --> 00:16:00,126
你們覺得這是內部人搞的事情嗎
You guys think this is an inside job?

386
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:03,696
唯一能讓我們搞清楚的方式就是衝進他們的派對了
Only way to find out is for us to crash their little party.

387
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:04,964
等等
Hold on.

388
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,866
Bancrofts是這裏的創始家族
Bancrofts are a founding family here,

389
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:08,467
有幾代人的歷史
go back for generations.

390
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,736
我們不能直接衝進去 開始盤問
We can't just show up and start asking questions.

391
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:13,105
或許我們不能 但是Pride可以
Maybe we can't, but Pride can.

412
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:00,286
這樣就能多看會兒表演了

如果是要談那些丟失的槍
Now, look, if this about those stolen guns,

423
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:31,317
現在不是時候
now is not the best time.

424
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,319
有人被你的槍所殺 Bancroft先生
Someone was killed with one of your guns, Mr. Bancroft.

425
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,487
如果我們不盡快找出是誰偷了那些槍
And if we don't find out who stole them real soon,

426
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,223
或許會有更多人喪命
more will likely die.

你見過Emma Miller醫生嗎
Have you seen Dr. Emma Miller?

430
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,565
當然 她幫助我們建立基金會
Well, sure, of course. She helped set up.

431
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,334
她和這件事有什麼關係
What's she got to do with this?

432
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:49,969
我們還不確定 所以我們想要和她談談
Yeah, we're not sure. That's why we want to talk to her.

433
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:50,903
我們會低調進行的
We'll be discreet.

434

435

明白
You got it.

436
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:54,773

Daddy, what's going on?

你看見過她嗎
Have you seen her?

440
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,948
見過 她就在附近 但是你們不能待會再找她嗎
Yeah, she's here somewhere, but can't you do this later?

441
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,350
恐怕不行
Afraid not.

442
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:05,818
你對Miller醫生瞭解多少
How well do you know Dr. Miller?

443

她就像是我的姐姐

被處決 跟Bellacroix一樣
Executed, just like Bellacroix.

453
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:37,016
看上去是兩三個小時前發生的
Looks like it happened a couple hours ago.

454
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:39,285
甚至可能在派對開始前
Maybe even before the party started.

455
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,757
我們剛從Miller醫生的家裏回來
Well, we just got back from Dr. Miller's house.

456
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,227
找到了防彈衣 帽子和夜視鏡
Found body armor, a balaclava and night vision goggles.

457
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:50,829
所以 除非她是喜歡深夜在敵人的火力下進行手術
So, unless she liked performing surgery in the dark

458
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:53,465
不然她就是搶劫團伙的一員
and under enemy fire, I'd say she was part of the heist crew.

459
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,834
團伙中有兩個女人嗎 這不太正常啊
Two women on the crew? That's unusual.

460
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,703
但如果這是真的 那團伙成員想掩蓋行蹤
Yeah, but if it's true, it doesn't make sense

461
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,872
就解釋不通了
that the crew's trying to cover their tracks now.

462
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,974
一定是有其他人在針對她們
It's got to be somebody else targeting them.

463
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,342
比如 敵對團伙嗎
Like what, a rival crew?

464
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:06,445
想為他們自己搞到那些槍 也是有可能
Trying to get the guns for themselves, possibly.

465
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:09,615
可能有個黑市買手出賣了她們
Could be a black market buyer double-crossing them.

466
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:11,984
你在Miller家裏找到橡膠子彈了嗎
You find any rubber bullets at Miller's house?

467
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:15,087
找到了 有幾個盒子 都是Bancroft產的
Yeah, several boxes, actually. All of them made by Bancroft.

468
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:17,122
Bancroft的名字一直在不停出現 不是嗎
Bancroft's name just keeps popping up, doesn't it?

469
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:19,224
出現的地方比你想的要多
Popping up in more places than you think.

470
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:21,460
你們來聽聽這個 但得快點
You need to hear this, but hurry.

471
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:23,462
你需要命令NCIS
<i>You need to get NCIS</i>

472
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:25,531
別再找我麻煩 知道嗎
off my back, you understand?

473
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,567
我不能讓他們調查那些失蹤的槍支
I can't have them investigating those missing guns,

474
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,402
-現在不行 -什麼意思
- not now. - What does that mean?

475
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:31,670
難道你知道它們的去向
You know where they are?

476
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,105

Mayor Hamilton?

477
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:34,907
Hamilton在電話裏
Hamilton was on the phone just starting

478
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:37,876
正想討論清水市 Bancroft就闖進來了
to talk about Clearwater when Bancroft bulled his way in.

479
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,211
-噓 -但是我和NCIS之間
- Shh. - But I got enough

480
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:40,546
麻煩已經夠多了
of my own problems with NCIS.

481
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:41,814
對此我也無能為力
There's nothing I can do.

482
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:43,782
你可以利用你的關係
You can use your connections.

483
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,818
越過他們
Go over their heads.

484
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,054
說你可以自己把槍找回來 變成英雄
Say you'll get the guns back on your own. Be a hero.

485
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:51,824
那我又怎樣恰好找回了那些槍呢
Yeah, and how am I supposed to get those guns back exactly?

486
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:53,792
這事交給我
You leave that to me.

487
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,163
和清水市沒什麼關係
Wasn't anything to do with Clearwater,

488
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:00,699
但我認為不管怎樣都應該錄下來
but I thought I should record it anyway.

489
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,102
難以相信Bancroft偷了他自己的槍
Can't believe Bancroft stole his own guns.

490
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:04,803
問題是 為什麼呢
Yeah, question is: why?

491
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,605
這麼一家金融巨頭
Company's doing great financially,

492
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,407
不缺這點兒保險賠償
doesn't need the insurance payoff.

493
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,809
有什麼關係 反正我們也不能用剛剛聽到的消息
Doesn't matter, we can't use what we just heard anyway.

494
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,244
竊聽範圍
Scope of the wiretap

495
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:14,313
僅限於Hamilton和清水市
is only for Hamilton and Clearwater.

496
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:16,115
我們不能就這樣忽視它
Well, we can't just ignore it.

497
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:18,250
所有人都把他牽扯進來了
Man all but incriminated himself.

498
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,586
為什麼你不直接逮捕Bancroft 給他施壓
Why don't you just bring Bancroft in, scare him?

499
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:21,820
之後再讓律師辯論
And let the lawyers argue

500
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:23,555
這是否被允許
whether it was admissible or not later.

501
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,758
因為那樣Bancroft就會發現錄音的事情
Because then Bancroft would find out about the tap,

502
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,559
意味著Hamilton也會知道
which means so would Hamilton.

503
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,262
這會毀掉你唯一扳倒他的機會
And then it would blow your one chance to bring him down.

504
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:33,165
但是另一方面 因為這批槍
Yeah, on the other hand, two people are already dead

505
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,800
已經死了兩個人
'cause of those guns.

506
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:37,536
在我們將他們捉拿歸案前 還有多少人會因此而死
How many more are gonna die before we get them back?

507
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,405
所以你打算怎麼辦
So what are you gonna do?

508
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:52,584
你做了一個錯誤的決定
You're making a mistake.

509
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,830
風險太大了 Pride 只是說說
It's a big risk, Pride. Just saying.

510
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:07,833
希望我們不會因此失去扳倒Hamilton的機會
Hope we don't lose Hamilton over it.

511
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,368
我也是
Me, too.

512
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:24,958
不得不說 我有一點吃驚
Got to say, I'm a little surprised.

513
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,726
憑你的本事
Man of your means--

514
00:21:26,728 --> 00:21:29,496
還以為 你現在會要求一個律師
would've thought you'd have asked for a lawyer by now.

515
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,432
我是無辜的 我不需要律師
I'm innocent. I don't need a lawyer.

516
00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:34,434
無辜的人不會讓自己犯罪的
Well, innocent men don't tend to incriminate themselves,

517
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:36,269
Bancroft先生
Mr. Bancroft.

518
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:39,339
如果我已經有了逮捕令 你會怎麼想
How else do you think I would've gotten an arrest warrant?

519
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,541
我不知道 請你直說
I don't know, you tell me.

520
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,611
Patton
Patton?

521
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:45,846
好
Yeah.

522
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,080
不好意思 Bancroft
I'm sorry, Bancroft,

523
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,915
但是我和NCIS之間的麻煩已經夠多了
but I got enough of my own problems with NCIS.

524
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,083
對此我也無能為力
There's nothing I can do.

525
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:51,985
你可以利用你的關係
You can use your connections,

526
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:53,487
越過他們
go over their heads.

527
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:57,357
說你可以自己把槍找回來 變成英雄
Say you'll get the guns back on your own. Be a hero.

528
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,293
那我又該怎樣恰好找回了那些槍呢
Yeah, and how am I supposed to get those guns back exactly?

529
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:02,796
這事交給我
You leave that to me.

530
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:06,266
我聽著不像是無辜的啊
Doesn't sound so innocent to me.

531
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:09,002
這是斷章取義
That is taken out of context.

532
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:11,438
另外 你是怎麼得到這個的
Besides, how'd you get that?

533
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,474
你竊聽我嗎 理由是什麼
You put a tap on me? On what grounds?

534
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:17,043
不是竊聽你 而是市長
Tap wasn't on you. It was on the mayor.

535
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,212
你只是求錯了人
You just got help from the wrong person,

536
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,547
然後被逮到了
got caught.

537
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,150
我不在乎你為什麼要偷自己的槍
I don't give a damn why you stole your own guns.

538
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:26,353
我只想在更多的人被殺害前 找回這批槍
I just want to get 'em back before anybody else gets killed.

539
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:28,088
我沒有偷
I didn't steal them.

540
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,190
那你為什麼知道這批槍在哪兒
Then why do you know where the guns are?

541
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:32,993
為什麼你跟Hamilton說你可以把槍拿回來
How come you told Hamilton you can get 'em back?

542
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:38,932
除非你開始坦白 地檢署將會指控你
Unless you start talking, U.S. attorney's gonna charge you

543
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:41,568
作為共犯 重度謀殺罪
as a coconspirator, felony murder.

544
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,739
你不想以後的人生都在監獄度過吧
You don't want to spend the rest of your life in prison,

545
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,074
坦白 快點
talk... fast.

546
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:52,212
我不能
I can't.

547
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:58,351
不好意思 Pride 但是Izzo來了
Sorry, Pride, but Izzo's here.

548
00:22:58,353 --> 00:23:00,620
她堅持要跟你談話
She insists on talking to you.

549
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:03,623
你知道當初我單單為了安裝竊聽設備
<i>Do you realize how many</i> <i>hoops I had to jump through</i>

550
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,126
就要突破多少障礙嗎
just to get that wiretap granted in the first place?

551
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:07,594
我知道 Karen 但是我必須
I know, Karen, but I had...

552
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,329
沒有但是 Dwayne
No buts, Dwayne.

553
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:12,899
你用竊聽Hamilton得到的證據逮捕了Bancroft
You based the arrest of Bancroft on Hamilton's wiretap.

554
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:15,535
一個優秀的被告辯護律師不會這麼容易善罷甘休的
A good defense attorney will get that kicked easily.

555
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:17,204
Bancroft犯了罪
Well, Bancroft incriminated himself.

556
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:18,205
那我應該怎麼辦
What was I supposed to do?

557
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:19,573
你就應該忽視掉
You were supposed to ignore

558
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,408
你所聽到的 那就是該做的
what you heard, that's what.

559
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,810
太多的槍消失了 我需要做出選擇
Too many guns are missing. I had to make a choice.

560
00:23:23,812 --> 00:23:25,845
這是一個可能會讓你失去
A choice that's probably gonna cost you

561
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:27,847
扳倒Hamilton的機會的選擇
any chance of bringing down Hamilton.

562
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:30,917
他會發現的 如果他現在還沒有的話
He's gonna find out, if he hasn't already.

563
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,319
我稍後會考慮這個問題的
I'll worry about that later.

564
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:34,654
不 你現在就應該考慮
No, you need to worry about that now.

565
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:38,892
Dwayne 如果Hamilton市長真的像你說的那麼不堪
Dwayne, if Mayor Hamilton is as dirty as you say he is,

566
00:23:38,894 --> 00:23:40,193
他會報復你的
he's going to retaliate.

567
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:41,661
你知道他會
You know he will.

568
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:44,097
我不會讓更多的人被殺害
I wasn't gonna let more people get killed.

569
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:45,532
你應該打電話給我
You should've called me!

570
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:47,867
我沒有時間 我必須行動
I didn't have time, I had to act.

571
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,269
我警告過你
I warned you.

572
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:50,737
我警告過你用監聽的方式
I warned you about the risk

573
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:52,906
調查Hamilton這種大人物
of going after a powerful man like Hamilton,

574
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:55,508
風險有多高
about blowing the wire.

575
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,011
你完全沒意識到你在做什麼
You have no idea what you've done.

576
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:13,560
她看起來不怎麼高興
Well, she doesn't seem happy.

577
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:15,528
她是不高興
She's not.

578
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,997
但還是回到正題吧
But let's stay on point.

579
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:21,234
Bancroft不肯開口 我想我知道原因
Bancroft's not talking, and I think I know why.

580
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:24,404
我不知道他是怎麼跟被偷的槍支牽扯上的
I don't know how he's involved with the stolen guns,

581
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:25,939
但是我絲毫不懷疑
but there's no question in my mind

582
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:27,407
他知道這批槍在哪兒
that he knows where they are.

583
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:29,576
-但他還是不會告訴你 -不會
- But he still wouldn't tell you? - Nope.

584
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:32,112
我認為他在保護某個人
And I think it's because he's protecting somebody,

585
00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:34,748
某個他寧願為其蹲監獄的人
somebody he's willing to go to jail for.

586
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,850
他的女兒
His daughter.

587
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,618
Nadine怎麼會
How can Nadine

588
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,986
牽扯進這種事
possibly be involved in this?

589
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:41,621
她牽扯的程度可能比你想像的要深
Well, she may be more involved than you think.

590
00:24:41,623 --> 00:24:45,025
我用先進的鏈接和社交網絡分析
I just ran case and victim profiles

591
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,826
運行了案例和受害者資料
through advanced link and social network analysis;

592
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:48,295
猜猜誰的名字出現在得分榜上
guess whose name lit up the scoreboard.

593
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:50,030
Nadine Bancroft
Nadine Bancroft.

594
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,865
她也涉及到數個不同層面的案件
She connects to the case on several levels, too:

595
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:55,468
地域 社會經濟 年齡 學校 社交媒體
geographic, socioeconomic, age, schools, social media.

596
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,736
在另外三個朋友的婚禮上
I mean, all were bridesmaids

597
00:24:56,738 --> 00:24:58,204
她都是伴娘
at three other friends' weddings.

598
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,673
無國界醫生 陸戰隊員
Doctors Without Borders, Marines,

599
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:01,408
Nadine加入了和平隊
Nadine joined the Peace Corps.

600
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,611
這些人並不僅僅是一群富豪
I mean, these are hardly just a bunch of rich debutantes.

601
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:06,646
可以解釋為什麼沒有人能抓住這個團隊
Could explain why nobody's been able to catch the crew.

602
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:08,615
沒有人會懷疑他們 而且
Nobody would ever suspect them, plus...

603
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:10,850
Nadine知道怎樣竊取槍支
Nadine would know exactly how to steal the guns

604
00:25:10,852 --> 00:25:11,985
而不被抓住
without getting caught.

605
00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:14,487
你是很認真地在說
Are you seriously suggesting that

606
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:16,856
Nadine Bancroft是搶劫團伙的一員嗎
Nadine Bancroft is part of the heist crew?

607
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:19,826
她從自己家偷槍支 為什麼呢
That she stole the guns from her own family? Why?

608
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:22,996
不知道 但是如果他父親發現她做的事情
Don't know, but if her father found out what she was doing,

609
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:25,365
他在努力保護她 這是說得通的
makes sense he's trying to protect her.

610
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,934
這也是為什麼他跟Hamilton說會幫忙找回槍支
And that's why he told Hamilton he'd get him back the guns.

611
00:25:27,936 --> 00:25:30,870
所以 這位富家女是在博人眼球嗎
So, what, Silver Spoon here is vying for attention?

612
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:33,573
在反對他們多麼有錢 還是什麼
Rebelling against how rich they are or something?

613
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,875
不 他們這樣做一定有別的原因
Nah, there's got to be another reason why they're doing this.

614
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:38,611
不管什麼理由 這是一大批槍
Yeah, it's a lot of guns, whatever the reason.

615
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,347
問題是 除非我們找出原因 否則就不會知道
Problem is, we're never gonna figure out who's killing off

616
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:42,082
是誰在殺害搶劫團伙
the heist crew unless we figure out why.

617
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:46,419
意思是 他們接下來可能會殺Nadine
Which means, they could be after Nadine next.

618
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,788
通知警方
Alert NOPD.

619
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,924
讓他們去Bancroft家
Get 'em out to the Bancrofts'.

620
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,125
出發
Let's go.

621
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,066
我們到了現場 Christopher 準備
<i>We're on scene,</i> <i>Christopher. Stand by.</i>

622
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:03,069
收到 發現Nadine了嗎
Copy that. Any sign of Nadine?

623
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:04,637
沒 暫時沒有
<i>No, not yet.</i>

624
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:07,540
有人開槍
Shots fired!

625
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:11,611
我認為他們已經抓到了Nadine
<i>I think they've got Nadine!</i>

626
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,979
我們還在追
<i>We're in pursuit!</i>

627
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:13,980
他們正朝你方向逃去
They're coming your way!

628
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:15,181
圍住他們
Box 'em in!

629
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:16,783
我們馬上就到
<i>We're almost there.</i>

630
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,054
他們來了 我們圍到他們了 Pride
<i>Here they come!</i> <i>We got 'em, Pride!</i>

631
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,900
趴下 Nadine
Drop, Nadine!

632
00:26:45,213 --> 00:26:47,113
你安全了
You're okay.

633
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:50,850
你安全了 你安全了
You're okay. You're okay.

634
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,778
我不想催你 Loretta 但
Hate to rush you, Loretta, but...

635
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,080
請告訴我 你能確認他們的身份
please tell me you can help us identify...

636
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:10,682
他們是博科聖地的人
They're Boko Haram.

637
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:10,682
{\a6}尼日利亞極端組織

638
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:13,751
至少這兩個人隸屬於
At least, that's the particular terrorist group

639
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:15,153
這個恐怖組織
these two gunmen belonged to.

640
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,856
博科聖地出現在新奧爾良
Boko Haram in New Orleans?

641
00:27:17,858 --> 00:27:19,190
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

642
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:20,925
很不幸 我確定
Unfortunately, I am.

643
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:24,062
注意那條從額頭到鼻子的傷疤
Notice the scarring from forehead to nose,

644
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:26,598
臉上還有兩條筆直的線
the two rectilinear lines down the cheeks.

645
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,066
部落傷疤
Tribal scars.

646
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:32,437
許多非洲少數民族使用不同的面部標識
Many African ethnic groups use distinctive facial markings--

647
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:37,408
約魯巴人 伊博人 豪撒人 但這兩位是卡努裏人
Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa-- but these men are Kanuri.

648
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,111
他們被博科聖地重金招募
Heavily recruited by Boko Haram.

649
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:42,380
我一直都不敢相信 直到
I couldn't believe it myself until

650
00:27:42,382 --> 00:27:45,850
在他腳踝上看到了這個瘢痕紋身
I saw the keloid tattoo on their ankles.

651
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:47,719
BH
「BH.」

652
00:27:47,721 --> 00:27:49,854
我在非洲做了很長時間的
You know how much time I've spent

653
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:51,489
志願者 Dwayne
volunteering in Africa, Dwayne.

654
00:27:51,491 --> 00:27:53,324
我親眼見過
I've witnessed firsthand

655
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:55,026
這些畜生在無辜的女人和孩子身上
the horrors these animals perpetrate

656
00:27:55,028 --> 00:27:56,527
干的壞事
on innocent women and children.

657
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:58,263
我知道 Loretta
I know, Loretta.

658
00:27:58,265 --> 00:28:00,465
我們會盡全力阻止他們
We're gonna do everything we can to stop them.

659
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:01,599
問題是
Yeah, the question is:

660
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:03,368
他們在這裏幹什麼
what are they doing here?

661
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,104
為什麼要殺搶劫團伙呢
And why are they killing the heist crew?

662
00:28:06,106 --> 00:28:08,439
他們肯定想要那些槍
They must want the guns.

663
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,341
但是 他們一開始是怎麼知道
But still, how'd they know Nadine and her crew

664
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:12,243
Nadine和她的人想要偷走槍呢
were gonna steal the guns in the first place?

665
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:13,578
不知道
I don't know.

666
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,346
也許Nadine能告訴我們
Maybe Nadine could tell us.

667
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:17,615
告訴其他人 我們馬上回去
Let the rest of the team know we're heading back.

668
00:28:17,617 --> 00:28:19,150
讓Gregorio
Have Gregorio

669
00:28:19,152 --> 00:28:21,219
通報國土安全部和FBI
alert DHS and FBI.

670
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:23,988
我懷疑 這只是襲擊小隊中的兩名成員而已
Doubt these are the only two members of the hit squad,

671
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,858
我們需要其他機構幫忙 追捕其他人
which means we could use a lot of help finding the others.

672
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,459
這就去
On it.

673
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:33,531
他們肯定要活捉Nadine 而不是殺害她
Must've taken Nadine instead of killing her

674
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:36,534
希望她能告訴他們槍在哪兒
in hopes that she would tell 'em where the guns were hidden.

675
00:28:36,536 --> 00:28:39,604
肯定要對她嚴刑逼供
No doubt by torturing her.

676
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:40,805
你說什麼
What do you mean?

677
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,206
那位海軍陸戰隊員
From the Marine.

678
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:45,944
韌帶撕裂 死前挫傷
Torn ligaments, antemortem bruising.

679
00:28:45,946 --> 00:28:48,012
初步檢查的時候沒有發現
I didn't see it in the prelim,

680
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:50,715
但是這個可憐的女人在死前
but the poor woman was clearly tortured

681
00:28:50,717 --> 00:28:52,483
肯定被嚴刑逼供了
before she was executed.

682
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:55,420
他們可能從她這兒獲取了所有想要的情報
They would've gotten everything they wanted from her.

683
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:57,655
Dwayne
Dwayne,

684
00:28:57,657 --> 00:28:59,891
一定要抓住這些混蛋
you've got to get these bastards.

685
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:01,960
但要小心
But be careful.

686
00:29:06,466 --> 00:29:10,034
你們救了我 我很感激
You saved my life, and I'm grateful.

687
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:12,370
但我不能告訴你們槍在哪裏
But I can't tell you where the guns are.

688
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:14,305
好吧 我不明白
Okay, I don't understand.

689
00:29:14,307 --> 00:29:17,075
你偷了你父親的槍
You stole your father's guns.

690
00:29:17,077 --> 00:29:19,243
兩個夥伴被殺了
Two of your friends were killed,

691
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:20,979
你差點兒被殺
you were nearly killed,

692
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:24,115
為什麼還不配合我們
and you won't cooperate with us?

693
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:26,517
你以為你是誰
Who do you think you are?

694
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,987
這不重要 你不會相信我
Doesn't matter, you won't believe me.

695
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:31,489
試試看
Try me.

696
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:37,161
Emma和我幾年前去過蘇丹的城市Jo
Emma and I visited Jo in Sudan a couple of years ago.

697
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:39,030
我們都很震驚
We were shocked.

698
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:41,232
那兒和這兒有天壤之別
It couldn't have been more different than here--

699
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:44,869
戰亂 饑荒
war-torn, famine.

700
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:47,872
那兒是人道主義災難
Place is a humanitarian disaster.

701
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:51,075
我們自願在[蘇丹首都]喀土穆幫助村民
We volunteered to help villagers set up

702
00:29:51,077 --> 00:29:53,311
建立起一座女子學校
a girls' school in Khartoum,

703
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:55,680
但是博科聖地發動了襲擊
but then Boko Haram attacked.

704
00:29:55,682 --> 00:29:57,448
我們逃到大使館
We were whisked

705
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,284
尋求庇護 但是
into the embassy for safety, but...

706
00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:04,622
我們通過大門看到不斷發生的襲擊
we watched the attack keep happening through the gates.

707
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:08,459
但是沒人想去阻止
And nobody tried to stop it.

708
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:12,363
女人被強暴
Women being raped,

709
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:14,532
孩子被射殺
children being shot.

710
00:30:15,902 --> 00:30:18,236
我們卻無能為力
And there was nothing we could do.

711
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:23,041
你不可能忘記這些事
You don't ever unsee something like that.

712
00:30:26,846 --> 00:30:29,047
槍是給村民的
Guns are for the villagers.

713
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:31,949
用來保護自己
To protect themselves.

714
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:33,718
因為沒有人會保護他們
'Cause nobody else will.

715
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,154
但博科聖地一定是發現了
But Boko Haram must've found out

716
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:37,255
我們做的事
what we've been doing,

717
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:39,123
所以他們來到這裏 要阻止我們
so they came here to try and stop us.

718
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,459
這是個崇高的動機
It's a noble cause,

719
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:44,896
但這是完全違法的
but it's-it's completely illegal.

720
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:47,065
偷槍
Stealing guns,

721
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:50,601
走私到海外
smuggling them out of the country...

722
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:54,672
違反了15條聯邦法律 你是知道的
breaks 15 federal laws, you know that.

723
00:30:56,276 --> 00:30:59,677
你真的願意冒著生命危險這麼做 對嗎
You're really willing to risk your life for this, aren't you?

724
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,013
是的
Yes, I am.

725
00:31:04,484 --> 00:31:06,250
如果你們不讓我走
If you don't let me go,

726
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:08,352
不把槍給村民
get the villagers those guns...

727
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,289
博科聖地會一直襲擊他們
...Boko Haram will keep attacking them

728
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,124
直到他們全死光
until they're all dead.

729
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:17,095
你真的能接受嗎
Can you really live with that?

730
00:31:25,438 --> 00:31:27,305
我們必須想辦法幫她
We have to find a way to help her.

731
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:29,040
沒辦法幫她 Sonja
Well, there's no way to help her, Sonja.

732
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,174
我們不能放她走
We can't let her go.

733
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:31,509
但要是Nadine說的是真的呢
But what if Nadine's right?

734
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:33,211
我們不能眼睜睜看著那些人死去
We can't just let those people die.

735
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:34,312
這事兒發生在大半個地球外
It's halfway around the world.

736
00:31:34,314 --> 00:31:35,413
這樣的人到處都有
There's people like that everywhere,

737
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:36,714
我們幫不了所有人
we can't help 'em all.

738
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:38,749
但我們現在瞭解了這些人的情況
Yeah, but we know about these people

739
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:40,718
也能幫助他們
and can do something about it.

740
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,887
幫助Nadine就意味著犯法
Helping Nadine means breaking the law.

741
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:44,288
那又怎樣 我們之前為了做正確的事
So? We've risked breaking the law before

742
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,490
也冒險行走在法律邊緣
to do the right thing.

743
00:31:45,492 --> 00:31:47,091
但這次不同 情況不一樣
Not like this. This is different.

744
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,960
怎麼會 有什麼不同
How? How is this different?

745
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,361
如果你非要問
If you have to ask,

746
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:51,596
那說明你沒有在理智思考
you're not thinking straight.

747
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:52,997
現在深呼吸
Now take a breath.

748
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:54,499
看來
Seems like

749
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:56,300
我們現在進退兩難
we're danged if we do and danged if we don't.

750
00:31:56,302 --> 00:31:58,102
如果我們不做點什麼
I mean, if we don't do something,

751
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:00,972
恐怖分子肯定會搶走槍
the terrorists are gonna get their hands on them guns anyway.

752
00:32:00,974 --> 00:32:02,773
還可能用它們來對付那些
Yeah, and probably use them against the very people

753
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:03,941
Nadine想要救的人
Nadine's trying to save.

754
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:05,743
Nadine也知道這個情況
Nadine knows we know that, too,

755
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:08,012
可能因此希望我們放了她
probably hoping we'll let her go because of it.

756
00:32:08,014 --> 00:32:09,814
真是進退維谷
It's a catch-22.

757
00:32:09,816 --> 00:32:12,049
好了
All right,

758
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:13,784
我們放她走
we'll let her go.

759
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:17,522
但要跟著她 讓她帶我們找到槍
But only to follow her so she leads us to the guns.

760
00:32:17,524 --> 00:32:19,257
等等 你是說我們要給她下套嗎
Wait, you mean we're gonna trick her?

761
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:22,493
不是下套 是要救她
No, not trying to trick her, trying to save her life

762
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:24,295
同時 不讓博科聖地得到那些槍
and keep Boko Haram from getting those guns.

763
00:32:24,297 --> 00:32:27,798
我們只能幫她到這兒了
And that's gonna have to be enough for you.

764
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:30,835
明白了嗎
Clear?

765
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:46,745
Nadine正向東走
<i>Nadine's still</i> <i>heading east towards</i>

766
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:48,579
沿著星條大道
<i>Stars and Stripes Boulevard,</i>

767
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:50,381
時速超過限速15英里
<i>going about 15 miles</i> <i>over the speed limit,</i>

768
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:52,216
也許你想把這條也加入指控
in case you want to add that to the charges.

769
00:32:52,218 --> 00:32:53,418
她是去機場嗎
Think she's heading to the airport?

770
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,819
希望不是
I hope not,

771
00:32:54,821 --> 00:32:56,287
因為所有光學測距器的單元信號
'cause all the RF and cell signals

772
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,456
都可能破壞你放在她口袋裏的追蹤器
might screw up the geotracker you put in her coat.

773
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,824
全靠你了 Patton
Counting on you, Patton.

774
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:01,726
我們得離她足夠近才能保護她
We got to stay close enough to protect her

775
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:02,927
以防恐怖分子襲擊她
in case the terrorists attack,

776
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:04,696
但不能太近 防止她發現我們
but not so close that she spots us.

777
00:33:04,698 --> 00:33:06,397
我想知道他們為什麼還沒襲擊她
I wonder why they haven't attacked her yet.

778
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,899
也許他們已經找到槍了
Maybe they already found the guns,

779
00:33:07,901 --> 00:33:09,701
要是這樣的話 他們就不需要跟著她了
and if so, they don't need to follow her.

780
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:11,135
除非他們一開始就不是衝著槍而來
Except they didn't come for the guns first,

781
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:12,537
而是衝著Nadine來的
they came for Nadine.

782
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:15,373
不要擔心 我們會保護她的
Don't worry, we're not gonna let anything happen to her.

783
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:18,042
記住 一旦她帶我們找到槍
Just remember, as soon as she leads us to the guns,

784
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:20,244
我們就要逮捕Nadine
we got to get Nadine,

785
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:22,080
拿到槍 然後離開
get the guns, and then get out of there.

786
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:23,381
特別是當他們已經找到了槍的情況
Especially if they already found them.

787
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:25,016
他們可能就在那兒等她
They could be lying in wait for her.

788
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:26,718
她從Crofton下去了
She's getting off on Crofton.

789
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,053
可能是去出租的飛機棚
She might be headed to the charter hangars.

790
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:31,255
該死 她的信號中斷了
Damn it, her signal's breaking up.

791
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:33,358
我們得拉近距離
We got to close the gap.

792
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:39,497
我不明白這事 Christopher
I don't know about this, Christopher.

793
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:42,266
我還是不敢相信 我們要逮捕她
I still can't believe we're gonna arrest her.

794
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:46,104
King做了決定 我們做好自己的工作就行了
King made the call. Let's just do our jobs.

795
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:57,448
這個集裝箱應該已經卸貨了
The storage pods were supposed to be unloaded

796
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,717
並且已經在飛機上了 我沒法等那麼久
and on the plane by now. I can't wait that long.

797
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:01,486
對不起 Nadine 但我們得推遲
I'm sorry, Nadine, but we got delayed

798
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:02,520
到達機場
getting to the airport.

799
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:04,956
等等 有些不對勁
Wait. Something's happened.

800
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:06,257
槍在哪兒
Where are the guns?

801
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:08,026
你什麼意思 什麼槍在哪兒
What do you mean, where are the guns?

802
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:09,460
Nadine 怎麼了
Nadine, what's wrong?

803
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:10,895
一切都還好嗎
Is everything okay?

804
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:12,597
Nadine Nadine
Nadine? Nadine!

805
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,302
嘿
Hey!

806
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:20,405
你在幹什麼
What are you doing...

807
00:34:45,732 --> 00:34:47,498
Nadine 停下
Nadine, stop!

808
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,499
你跟蹤我
You followed me.

809
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:50,168
是的 而且又一次救了你的命
Yeah, and saved your life again.

810
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:53,337
-跑去候機樓 -我得跑的更遠一些
- Run to the terminal. - I'm gonna run farther than that.

811
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,339
博科聖地會為了這事兒報復村民的
Boko Haram's gonna retaliate against the villagers for this.

812
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:58,709
如果我沒法把槍給他們 至少讓我警示他們
If I can't get them guns, at least let me warn them,

813
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:00,011
讓他們離開
move them.

814
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:03,648
我有辦法
I have the means.

815
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,750
如果你允許 我可以很快離開這個國家
I can easily leave the country if you let me.

816
00:35:05,752 --> 00:35:07,685
對不起 Nadine 我不能
No, I'm sorry, Nadine, I can't.

817
00:35:07,687 --> 00:35:09,687
拜託了
Please.

818
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:25,937
Percy 你沒事吧
Percy, you good?

819
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:42,220
Nadine怎麼樣了
How's Nadine?

820
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,725
她去哪兒了
Where is she?

821
00:35:49,562 --> 00:35:50,962
她 她跑了
Sh-She got away.

822
00:35:50,964 --> 00:35:53,331
陪著他
Stay with him.

823
00:36:04,778 --> 00:36:07,479
我想知道今天外面發生了些什麼
I want to know what happened out there today.

824
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:09,514
我已經告訴你我知道的了 Pride
I told you what I know, Pride.

825
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:12,617
你告訴了我 你想讓我知道的
You told me what you want me to know.

826
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:14,919
Nadine不可能在你手下跑了
No way Nadine got away from you.

827
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:17,856
見鬼了 Sonja
Damn it, Sonja,

828
00:36:17,858 --> 00:36:21,793
Brody走後 我努力重建這支隊伍
I worked too hard to rebuild this team after Brody left.

829
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:23,128
比以前更強大了
Stronger than ever.

830
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,831
你怎麼可以冒險把這一切都毀了呢
How could you be so willing to risk throwing it all away?

831
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,751
這個隊伍對你的意義 不比別人少吧
This team means as much, if not more, to you than to anybody.

832
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:30,666
這知道
I know that.

833
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,650
那你為什麼不告訴我到底發生了什麼
Then why the hell won't you tell me what happened?

834
00:36:33,306 --> 00:36:35,106
有什麼區別呢
What difference does it make?

835
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:37,075
我們抓到了恐怖分子 對嗎
We got the terrorists, didn't we?

836
00:36:37,077 --> 00:36:38,576
還有槍支
And the guns.

837
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,078
Nadine不是壞人
Nadine is not the bad guy.

838
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,213
那怎麼那麼多執法部門
Then how come half of law enforcement's

839
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:44,282
仍然在外面找她
still out there looking for her?

840
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:52,524
如果我告訴你了 Pride 任何這間辦公室之外的人
If I told you, Pride, and anybody outside of this office

841
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:54,092
發現了真相
found out,

842
00:36:54,094 --> 00:36:55,860
你也會有麻煩的
you would get in trouble, too.

843
00:36:55,862 --> 00:36:57,328
我不能讓這一切發生
I can't let that happen.

844
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,863
我已經陷入麻煩了
I'm already in trouble.

845
00:36:58,865 --> 00:37:01,232
為了這事我犧牲了抓捕Hamilton的機會
I sacrificed Hamilton for this.

846
00:37:01,234 --> 00:37:03,735
天知道他會怎麼報復
God only knows how he's gonna retaliate.

847
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:08,206
這很嚴重 Sonja
This is serious, Sonja.

848
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:12,977
不僅僅是法律問題
Not just legally.

849
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:16,247
你不能報喜不報憂
You cannot cherry-pick which orders to follow--

850
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:17,716
至少在我眼皮底下不行
not on my watch.

851
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:19,350
這不是一支隊伍應該有的
That is not what a team is.

852
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:20,752
我也不會支持你
And I won't stand for it.

853
00:37:20,754 --> 00:37:23,722
我們之前就已經談過了
And we've had this conversation before.

854
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:28,760
Nadine到底怎麼了
What happened to Nadine?

855
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:42,340
對不起
I'm sorry.

856
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:44,509
我不能說
I can't.

857
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:52,050
就這樣吧
That'll be all.

858
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:04,562
嘿
Hey.

859
00:38:04,564 --> 00:38:07,065
嘿
Hey.

860
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,500
你在等我嗎
You waited for me?

861
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:10,735
我有些擔心
Well, I was a little worried.

862
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:12,871
一切都好嗎
Everything all right?

863
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,440
我不知道
I don't know.

864
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,776
Pride很生氣
Pride is pretty pissed.

865
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:20,712
我不能怪他
Can't say I blame him.

866
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:23,515
我 但我不知道他會做什麼
And I... I don't know what he's gonna do yet.

867
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:25,717
什麼意思 做什麼
What does that mean? Do what?

868
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,187
我不知道他會不會向總部舉報我
I don't know if he's gonna report me to HQ.

869
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:31,222
King不會這麼做的
King's not gonna do that.

870
00:38:31,224 --> 00:38:32,857
他知道這樣你就完了
He knows you'll be done for.

871
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:36,628
是啊 可我說了 他非常生氣
Yeah, like I said, he's pretty pissed.

872
00:38:38,732 --> 00:38:40,698
你告訴他究竟發生了什麼嗎
Well, did you tell him what really happened?

873
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,967
什麼 你也想知道麼
What, you're trying to find out, too?

874
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,605
不相信我嗎
Don't you trust me?

875
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:52,577
你有吃醋嗎
Were you jealous?

876
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:56,981
在咖啡店的男人
Guy in the coffee shop.

877
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:59,918
這有什麼聯繫呢
Now, what does that got to do with...

878
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,453
啊 你不能指望我相信你
Ah, you can't expect me to trust you

879
00:39:02,455 --> 00:39:04,322
如果你不相信我 對嗎
if you don't trust me, right?

880
00:39:06,226 --> 00:39:09,761
好吧 老實說 我不知道我什麼感覺
Well, honestly, I don't know what I felt.

881
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:12,530
我
I...

882
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:15,166
可能有一點點的吃醋吧
Maybe I could have been a little jealous.

883
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:19,838
那也許我可能讓Nadine跑了
And maybe I could have let Nadine go.

884
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:25,109
聽著 我不需要你給我講道理 Christopher
Hey, look, I don't need a lecture from you, Christopher,

885
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:28,346
我也不想讓這事影響到你
and I don't want this to bite you in the ass later,

886
00:39:28,348 --> 00:39:29,948
所以拜託了
so please,

887
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,483
別問我任何問題了好嗎
don't ask me any more questions, okay?

888
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,220
好的
Okay.

889
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:38,223
走吧 我們離開這兒
Come on, let's get out of here.

890
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:41,192
Percy
Percy.

891
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:46,164
剛和助理檢察官Lzzo通了電話
Just got off the phone with Assistant U.S. Attorney Izzo.

892
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:49,534
法官想讓我們現在就去市中心
Judge wants us both downtown now.

893
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,113
證據明顯
The evidence clearly contradicts

894
00:40:02,115 --> 00:40:04,148
和Percy探員在法庭上的證詞相違背
Agent Percy's statement to the court.

895
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,650
你撒謊了
You lied.

896
00:40:05,652 --> 00:40:07,485
沒有 是這樣
No. See...

897
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:10,355
當時隊伍正處在槍戰之中 我...
the team was in the middle of a firefight. I...

898
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:12,657
你在你宣誓過的證詞中
You said in your sworn statement,

899
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:15,894
是這麼說的"Nadine Bancroft逃跑了"
and I quote, 「Nadine Bancroft got away.」

900
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:19,330
明顯地 你本可以在那個時候逮捕她
Clearly, you could have arrested her right then and there.

901
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:21,165
在你回到隊伍之前 把她逮捕
Cuffed her before you went back in.

902
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,668
我擔心我的隊伍
I was worried about my team.

903
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:26,838
我做了主觀決定
I made a judgment call.

904
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,139
你讓一個重罪犯逃跑了
You let a felon escape.

905
00:40:28,141 --> 00:40:30,875
好的 等等
Okay, hold on.

906
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:33,945
單純出於好奇
Just out of curiosity...

907
00:40:33,947 --> 00:40:36,214
是什麼讓你去看監控的
what made you think to look for surveillance?

908
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:37,515
這不是重點
That's not the point.

909
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:39,684
這更像是報復而不是追求正義
It is if this is more about retribution than justice.

910
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,620
你是在寬恕你探員的行為嗎 Pride探員
Are you condoning your agent's behavior, Agent Pride?

911
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:45,556
我不寬恕以莫須有罪名進行政治迫害
I'm not condoning a witch hunt, if that's what you're asking.

912
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:47,992
你倆到底在說什麼
What the hell are you two talking about?

913
00:40:47,994 --> 00:40:50,862
尊敬的法官大人 Pride探員和Hamilton市長
Your Honor, Agent Pride and Mayor Hamilton

914
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:52,163
相處的不是很愉快
don't exactly get along.

915
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:53,698
那又和這事有什麼關係
And what does that have to do with this?

916
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,434
因為市長聽說發生的事情之後
Because when the mayor heard about what happened,

917
00:40:56,436 --> 00:40:59,337
他叫了督察長開始新的調查
he asked the inspector general to open an investigation.

918
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:01,906
報復我調查他的事兒
Retribution for my investigating him.

919
00:41:01,908 --> 00:41:03,741
-純屬推測 -說的跟真的一樣
- Conjecture. - Like hell it is!

920
00:41:03,743 --> 00:41:04,742
夠了
Enough.

921
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:06,311
你們倆可以晚些繼續吵
You two can argue about this later.

922
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:08,379
但這沒有改變事實
But it doesn't change the facts.

923
00:41:09,482 --> 00:41:11,616
你有大麻煩了 年輕的女士
You're in serious trouble, young lady.

924
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:12,750
因為在我眼裏
Because as far as I'm concerned,

925
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:14,786
你沒有說實話
you're not telling me the truth.

926
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:17,588
你有最後一次機會
You have one last chance.

927
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,792
我想知道你為什麼沒有逮捕 Nadine Bancroft
I want to know why you didn't arrest Nadine Bancroft,

928
00:41:20,794 --> 00:41:22,860
我想知道她在哪兒
and I want to know where she is,

929
00:41:22,862 --> 00:41:25,196
否則我要判你偽證罪
or I'm gonna charge you with perjury

930
00:41:25,198 --> 00:41:27,732
以及輕視法庭
and hold you in contempt.

931
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,667
你明白嗎
Do you understand?

932
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:36,975
Karen Karen 等等 等等
Karen, Karen, come on, come on.

933
00:41:36,977 --> 00:41:39,143
你為什麼這麼做
Why are you doing this?

934
00:41:39,145 --> 00:41:40,378
別怪我 Dwayne
Don't blame me, Dwayne.

935
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,846
你探員自找的
Your agent brought this on herself.

936
00:41:41,848 --> 00:41:43,314
我只是做本職工作
I'm just doing my job.

937
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:45,450
是啊 更像是執行Hamilton的命令
Yeah, more like doing Hamilton's bidding.

938
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:47,952
沒想到你也是和市長同一陣營的
Didn't realize that you were in the mayor's pocket, too.

939
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:49,153
你知道這不是真的
You know that's not true.

940
00:41:49,155 --> 00:41:50,188
是嗎
Do I?

941
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,422
底線是
Bottom line:

942
00:41:51,424 --> 00:41:53,658
你的探員搞砸了 Hamilton反撲了
your agent screwed up, and Hamilton pounced.

943
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,728
我警告過你 如果他發現竊聽一事的後果
I warned you what would happen if he found out about the wire.

944
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,029
沒什麼我能做的
There's nothing I could do.

945
00:41:58,031 --> 00:41:59,364
這不是真的
That's not true.

946
00:41:59,366 --> 00:42:03,634
你讓他開了場 現在你必須接受事實
You gave him the opening, now you have to live with it.

947
00:42:06,973 --> 00:42:09,040
剛發生了什麼 King
What just happened, King?

948
00:42:09,776 --> 00:42:11,009
Percy呢
Where's Percy?

949
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:17,648
他們要帶她去監獄
They're taking her to jail.

950
00:42:20,762 --> 00:42:27,562
