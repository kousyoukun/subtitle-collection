If your toddler doesn't sleep
and cries all night,

31
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:36,532
it might very well be gas

32
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,067

Kind of like a football, right?

00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:50,146
And you pat him gently.

38

You can even rock him

and a mama I barely know.

Is this you asking
me for advice?

Because, normally,

58
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:41,194
I'd love to help,
Lasalle, I really would,

but I'm back home in DC in about
a minute and a half.

60
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:47,532
Except the problem is,
you're the only one that knows.

61
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,401
Right.

62
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,769
That is the problem.

63
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,238
It's a little awkward,
don't you think?

64
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,606
I mean, I thought you would
have told Country Mouse

65
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:55,807
about it by now.

Percy, she's City Mouse.
You know what?

68
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,413
You ought to talk to Pride
about this.

advice than Dr. Phil.

Sure.

82
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:52,660

what's wrong with Lasalle?

87

He's jumpy, he's
getting these texts.

88
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,978
He looks like a zombie,
but he won't tell me about it.

89
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,880
Does seem a little bit
distracted lately.

90
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:15,949
Right. So.

91
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,351
When's the "Pride talking to"
scheduled?

92
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:19,852
Doesn't work like that.

93
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:21,154
He'll come around

94
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:22,755

Ready, ready, right.

95
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:24,857
See, the thing is,
he already told FBI.

96
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:27,326
She's obviously
hip to it, so...

97

Bribery's not needed, Dwayne.

But it's always happily
encouraged.

109
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:06,763
So, across the street
a rowdy motorcycle rally,

110
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,267
thousands of "American outlaws"
in town.

111
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,068
Can't say I didn't
expect a casualty,

112
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,937
just didn't expect it
to be yours.

113
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,805
Well, the Vic
is Lloyd Fillibert.

114
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:18,574
BU1 stationed
in Gulfport, Mississippi.

115
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:21,344
There's paperwork
from the Oasis Motel.

116
00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:24,180
Feet away from Bike Week's
festival grounds.

117
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:27,216
Seabee was visiting
for the biggest

118
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:29,118
motorcycle rally
in the South.

119
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,320
Question is...

120
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:33,122
how'd the ride turn deadly?

121
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,589
Well, here's the basics.

122
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:37,792
It's a small caliber round.

123
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:40,061
It entered through
the rear of the rib cage,

124
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,963
perforated the
poor soul's heart.

125
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,165
It was a clean shot.

126
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,299
Was dead in seconds.

127
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,767
That kind of an eye for detail,

128
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,269
we're not looking at
an accidental shooting.

129
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:49,437
Try road rage.

130
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,572
NOPD tells us your Vic
was lined up for a street race.

131
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:53,440
Well, that would explain
the burnt rubber.

132
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:56,310
I'm guessing maybe... 20 bikers?

133
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:58,579
And if Fillibert was shot
at close range...

134
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,914
The killer was one of them.

135
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,417
Motorcycle race goes down
in New Orleans,

136
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,985
there's gonna be onlookers,
Chris.

137
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:06,253
Well, I already checked.

138
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,354
Either the witnesses
fled from the scene

139
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:10,223
or they have a case
of selective memory.

140
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:12,425
May have been afraid to rat
on the wrong club.

141
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:14,060
MCs can go anywhere

142
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:15,161
from harmless weekend warriors

143
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:16,929
to elaborate crime syndicates.

144
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,764
Seen my share at ATF to know.

145
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:21,501
It's smart to keep quiet.

146
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:26,438
Victim was a member
of the Brothers at Arms.

147
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:30,809
Club's got a long-standing
history in New Orleans.

148
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:33,245
Started as an honorable idea.

149
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,847
Disenfranchised vets
without home or purpose

150
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:38,250
banded together
to give them both.

151
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:39,851
Supposed to do good
after Katrina.

152
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:41,219
But...

153
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,687
Others didn't want
them on their turf.

154
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,555
Yeah, 'cause the turf
belonged to the Niners.

155
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:46,624
Bad motorcycle gang.

156
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,659
Drug dealing,
trafficking weapons...

157
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:51,128
I used to go after them
when I was with ATF.

158
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,597
Tried to root them out,
but turned out

159
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:53,664
they were too well entrenched.

160
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,266
Yeah, smart, too.

161
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:57,735
Somehow made the vets look
like they were the bad guys.

162
00:06:57,737 --> 00:06:59,603
Didn't help back then
that some folks thought

163
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:01,904
all vets were damaged
goods and violent.

164
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:04,274
Even though they were
really here to help rebuild?

165
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:07,377
Niners viewed them as a threat,
just wanted them gone.

166
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:09,346
Sucked them into a fight,
innocent people got hurt,

167
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:11,881
and the vets
took the blame

168
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,049
for all the unrest.

169
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:14,684
The city...
quick to judge,

170
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:16,518
so they left.
- And now this

171

There's the Niners
right there.

173
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:26,328
Oh.

174
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:33,468
He didn't spot me, did he?

175
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,602
Who?

176
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,170
I think she's talking
about the cute guy,

177
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:39,707
tribals on a tank,
Johnny Depp circa 1990.

178
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,342
Know him I take it?

179
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:42,410
Yeah, sort of.

180
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:44,011
He was an ATF informant.

181
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,045
Ramon.

182
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,581
Ramon?

183
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,683
Is he a Niner?

184
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,950
No, he used to build

185
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,852
custom bikes... or
at least he used to.

186
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,621
He's probably here
for the rally.

him dead and why.

Don't scratch it, Yankee.

What?

196
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,405
Overly casual response,

one-sided shoulder shrug,

198

It's none of

unless it's something
that affects work,

211
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,035

Just... here if
you need me.

Well... just might be a...

Keep an open mind, but...

Specifics would be helpful.

224
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:14,363
I think I might be a dad, King.

own getting killed.

City sent you to make
us leave, Pride?

A lot of things went wrong,
I admit.

254
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,204
Yeah, it did. We got chased
out of town like a bunch

255
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:35,673
of criminals all because

256
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:39,043
NOPD was too afraid
to take on the real outlaws.

257
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,209
We're not NOPD.

258
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,712
Here for information,

259
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:43,747
not accusations.

260

Okay? It might help us find out
who killed your man.

00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:52,121
Save the tax dollars, Sheriff.

263
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:54,591
Niners killed Fillibert.
Easy as that.

00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:56,459
And how are you so sure?

265
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:00,963
My club came back for the rally.

266
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:03,098
Thought after ten years,
maybe we'd start over,

267
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,167
places still need
rebuilding.

268
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,202
Barely crossed state line
'fore we hear

269
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:09,204
that the Niners
are planning something.

270
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:10,539
Now, one of
'em must've

271
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,374
convinced him to run
in their race

272
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:14,776
as a-a peace offering.

273
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:17,545
Got Fillibert shot instead.

274
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,180
He was racing the Niners?

275
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:22,416
Surrounded him, ten to one.
Then one of them killed him.

276
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:27,555
I'm not waiting on the law
to do the right thing

00:11:27,557 --> 00:11:29,056
this time.
- Okay,

you want to make a fresh start?

279

You don't want
to be called criminals?

280

You go out there, retaliate,

That doesn't make this right.

284

Got to give me
a chance here, Hogan.

Fillibert's the casualty

It's hard

Yeah, apparently they were
holding a meeting inside.

320
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:46,377
Which means
whoever did this...

321
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:47,936
Knew they'd be here.

322
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:51,304
I know you don't want to hear
it, King, but maybe the vets...

323
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:53,807
Could've taken justice in
their own hands. I know.

324
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,409
Doesn't make sense, though.

325
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:57,177
If Hogan had
already planned this,

326
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,180
why send us over here
so we could see it all?

Hey! You!

328

What are you gonna do
about this, huh?

329
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:05,472
You gonna arrest
these bastards or not?

330
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:06,354
Morrow.

331
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:08,855
You know him?
Leader of the Niners.

332
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:10,757
You need to calm
down, take it easy.

333
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:12,725
I figured it'd be you
working on this case.

334
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:16,061
Just like ten years ago, huh?
Both know damn well who did it.

335
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,531
We're not jumping to conclusions,
just like we're not jumping to conclusions

336
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:19,980
about who shot one
of their men either.

337
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:21,702
You protecting them?

338
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:23,468
Is that what this is?
Just because they're vets?

339
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,003
- This has nothing to do with them being...
- Hey!

340
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:26,838
Hey, hey.
We got it under control.

341
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,273
All right?

342
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,875

What'd you find, Sebastian?

347
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:43,421
Uh, mostly shrapnel.

348
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,155
Looks like it came
from some kind of detonator.

349
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:46,757
I'm thinking
improvised explosives device.

350
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,225
IED.

351
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:49,693
Anything on the explosives?

352
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:51,495
Yeah. Matter of fact,
got to finally use

353
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:54,131
my laser-induced
breakdown spectroscope again.

354

It identifies
explosives on site.

355
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:58,367
Also fulfills my lifelong dream
of wielding a laser gun.

356
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:00,537
What exactly did it identify?
Well,

357
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:03,506
given the nitroglycerin base,
sorbents, and stabilizers,

358
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:05,274
it looks
like old-school dynamite.

359
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:08,277
Used mostly <font color="#0CEC0C">(phone ringing)</font>
just for demolition these days.

360

Gonna spare you the choice.

364
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:17,586
ATF still classifies the Niners
as a motorcycle gang.

365
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:20,522
Two of 'em are up
on murder charges as we speak.

366
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:22,658
FBI also shows several
attempted sting ops

367
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,059
on racketeering charges,

368
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:25,327

That's the good news.
Other than a few bar fights,

371
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:30,499

372
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,266
Yeah, in fact, city hall shows

373
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:35,035
Fillibert pulled up a permit
six months ago.

374
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:36,904
Apparently the vets were
planning to help build

375
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:39,039
affordable housing
in Broadmoor.

376
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,240
Broadmoor's where they tried

377
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:42,176
to build ten years ago.
Yeah.

378
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:44,011
Right after that jerk
stole the Katrina funds.

379
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:45,212
McKinley.

380
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:47,414
How do you know about McKinley?

381
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,815
Long story.

382
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,316
Any chance

383
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:52,352
Fillibert's permit
gave the vets access

384
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:54,387
to demolition explosives?

385
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,455
Looking into it.

386
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:02,696
Here. Shows the order
of a pickup last week. Why?

387
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:04,664
That what blew up
the Niners' shop?

388
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:08,300
You thinking the vets
retaliated for Fillibert?

389
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,802
Every sign's pointing
in that direction.

390
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:13,506
It just...
doesn't make sense though.

391
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:16,375
See where Loretta's at
on Fillibert's autopsy.

392
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:18,176
Maybe we can match bullet
to gun.

393
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,245
Chris'll go to the hospital,
find out what the vics know.

394
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,314
Coming back to the squad room?
No.

395
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:25,383
Pay another visit to the vets.
This time with a warrant.

396
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,785
We need to hustle here.
Bring in Fillibert's killer

397
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,588
and the bomber before things
get out of control.

I'm still investigating that.

Also investigating who blew up
the Niners' bike shop.

404

I don't know what
you're talking about.

405

Well, I hope
that's true.

'Cause a lot of people
got hurt.

407
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:06,321
All I know so far
is that, uh,

408
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:09,759
demolition explosives
were used over there.

409
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,161
Oh, jumping to
conclusions again, huh?

410
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:14,228
Par the course
for you people.

411
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,797
Just gathering evidence.

412
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,632
But I got to tell you,

413
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:19,801
if you or your boys
didn't do it,

414
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:22,971
somebody's working awful hard
to make it look like you did.

415
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:27,208
Maybe, uh, history
repeating itself again?

416
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,445
Maybe. Only way to prove
you didn't retaliate, though,

417
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:34,915
is to make sure that
the explosives don't match.

418
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:38,485
Evidence. That'll
square you away.

419

The bullet was a .22 caliber,

449
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:08,037
but more interesting
is a piece of fiber

450
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,674

So, not from what Fillibert
was wearing, I take it?

453
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:17,912
No, and it had trace amounts

454
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,814

which means...

455

It came from the discharge.
Shooter's clothing?

456
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:22,984
That's the theory.
- Yeah.

Yes. Uh, I might be able

Is there anything

Well, the questionable
fashion choice might help.

00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:58,483
from the hospital was how bad
the Niners want payback.

476
00:19:58,485 --> 00:20:00,920
Well, vets do, too,
from everything I can gather.

477
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:02,788
But if they're the ones that
blew up the Niners' shop,

478
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,255
then they already
got their payback.

479
00:20:04,257 --> 00:20:06,157
Unless they're not the ones
that blew it up.

480
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,325
Well, I don't know
who else could've.

481
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:08,893
The vets are loaded for bear.

482
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:10,895
Do we have
an explosives match yet?

483
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:14,032
Sebastian's still analyzing.
It's hard to think

484
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,967
it's not just an eye for an eye.
Yeah,

485
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:18,002
and it's only
gonna get worse, too.

486
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:21,105
We can't stand by and let
two motorcycle clubs

487
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:23,406
take justice
into their own hands.

488
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:25,976
You mean <i>continue</i> taking it
into their own hands?

489
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,745
Problem is, we don't have enough
leads yet to draw

490
00:20:27,747 --> 00:20:30,214
any conclusions,
let alone make any arrests.

491
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:31,982
Well, next move is the Niners.

492
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:33,817
Now, how do we stop them

493
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:36,253
before we get any more leads?

494
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:37,954
Ramon?

495
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:39,222
What?

496
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:41,490
Your old informant?

497
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,893
I mean, we saw him running
with the Niners, didn't we?

498
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:45,895
Might be our only way in,
plus Percy already has a cover.

499
00:20:45,897 --> 00:20:48,530
No way we get
a UC in any faster.

500
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:50,499
I don't know.

501
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:54,303
Just sayin', she's got both the
cover and the chops to do it.

502
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:57,038
Well, thanks. I think.

503
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,173
You think your cover's
still good?

504
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,607
Yeah, I mean...

505
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,777
I was long gone
when the raid went down.

506
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:04,312
Besides, Ramon wasn't part
of the gang we busted,

507
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:06,148
he was just my source.

508
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,416
There's no way he made me.

509
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:10,986
He could get us
valuable information,

510
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:13,053
maybe even enough to keep
this thing from escalating,

511
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,294
but if you're not comfortable,
then I don't...

512
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:15,393
No, no.

513
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,959
Gregorio's right.

514
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,427
I'll do it.

515
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:21,996
All right.
She has to wear a wire.

516
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:25,099
We have to be able to pull her
out if things get squirrely.

517
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:26,066
Agreed.

518
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,401
Gregorio.

519
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,002
You and Patton back her up.
Wait,

520
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,503
why Gregorio?
Maybe because

521
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:33,840
I've done a million
backups already at FBI.

522

Don't worry, I got your back.

523
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:39,846
All right, we'll work the case
from outside.

524
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:42,148
You let us know

a lot more comfortable

529

they're good together.

Boy, he looks like me.

630
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:36,532
And the math
definitely works.

631
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:37,968
Then the only way to deal
with something like this

632
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,169
is head-on.

633
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:42,172
It can't be easy
for the mom, either.

634
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:45,440
But one thing's
for sure...

635
00:26:45,442 --> 00:26:47,943
it's not something
you can avoid.

636
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,379
Call her back.

Hate to pressure you,
Sebastian, all right?

640
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,693
I'll take anything
you got.

641
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:07,595
Well, what I got, I don't think
you're gonna like.

642
00:27:07,597 --> 00:27:09,764
I reassembled most
of the IED,

643
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:12,200
and either your bomber's got
pristine Googling skills,

644
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:14,002
or he's got
a military background.

645
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:15,836
Okay, well, what about
the explosives?

646
00:27:15,838 --> 00:27:17,105
That's more bad news.

647
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:18,506
It's a perfect match
to the sample

648
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:19,806
you brought back from
the construction site.

649
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:21,841
I mean, there's
no doubt about it.

650
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,845
I don't want to believe that.

651
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:27,447
Why would the vets
come back here

652
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:30,951
after all these years
just to get sucked back into

653
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:33,353
what drove 'em out
in the first place, only worse?

654
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:36,222
Well, old grudges die hard.

655
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:38,891
Nobody's done more

I know.

659

Still, it's disappointing,
if it's true.

660
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:51,670
Something like this stains
the whole veteran community.

661
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,471
What are you gonna do?

662
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:57,508

Easy Rider, he
just fixed bikes.

667
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,996
He did the occasional run,
but he was a small fish.

668
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:21,865
Percy played the player
so she could get in.

That's it? Nothing else

No. In fact, she barely
mentioned him at all.

Did you guys find anything
on him at the FBI?

Just some petty stuff.

Hogan's missing.

682

We just went to bring him in,

I ran it against the Niners,
which was easy,

759
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,600
since they all have
a police record.

760
00:31:52,602 --> 00:31:54,134
What'd you find?
Nothing.

761
00:31:54,136 --> 00:31:55,436
No match, which means

762
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:56,770
Fillibert's killer
was not a Niner.

763
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,573
But he was wearing
a Niner jacket.

764
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:00,474
Yeah, because he wanted
to make it look like

765
00:32:00,476 --> 00:32:01,608
the Niners shot him.

766
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,642
Right, well, to that point,

767
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:04,043
I also ran DNA recovery

768
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:06,346
on the IED explosives, uh,

769
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:08,248
but no match on any of the vets,
either.

770
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,383
Checked both navy
and DoD records, too.

771
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:12,719
So, what, you're saying
that neither the Niners

772
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:14,954
or the vets are responsible
for all this?

773
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:17,390
Well, you know,
I'm just a scientist

774

775
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,226
but if we go by the evidence,

776
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:21,594
then yeah. However,

777
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:23,362
the evidence also shows

778
00:32:23,364 --> 00:32:25,531
that the DNA
from the killer's jacket

779
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:28,166
and the bomber's IED
are a match.

780
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:29,702
Which means?
A third party's

But to what end?

784
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:34,873
I mean, who stands to gain

785
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:35,873
from them killing each other?

786
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,008
What we have to find out.

787
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:40,678
<font color="#D900D9">(sighs)</font>

788
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,149
You hear this guy?

789
00:32:45,151 --> 00:32:47,051
Just the right
amount of cocky, huh?

790
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:49,387
20 high.
- I gotcha.

791
00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:51,522
Damn it.

792
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:54,258
I brought beer.

793
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,092
Yeah, about time.

794
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:01,632
What's going on
over there, anyway?

795
00:33:01,634 --> 00:33:04,134
I don't know. How would I know?
I just build bikes, right?

796
00:33:04,136 --> 00:33:05,869
Yeah, except I don't
see you building any.

797
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:07,404
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckles)</font>
Come on.

798
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:08,772
No, hold up.

799
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:10,839
You brought me all the way
out here to paradise pit,

800
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:12,941
I think I deserve to
know what's going on.

801
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:15,511
I just don't want us to get
in any kind of trouble.

802
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:16,779
We can't,
you're my lucky charm.

803
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:18,614
I don't get in any trouble
when you're around.

804
00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:23,118
Come on, let's go catch up
in private.

805
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:26,488
Think I might have something.

806
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,889
I'll call you back.

807
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,225
<b><font color="#FF8000">LASALLE:</font></b>
Zoning maps?

808
00:33:31,227 --> 00:33:33,127
I've been trying to figure out
who else

809
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:35,229
would want the Niners
and the vets fighting again,

810
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:37,098
but I keep coming up empty.

811
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,267
Then I started wondering
if maybe it was more about

812
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:42,270
somebody not wanting the vets
back in town at all.

813
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,237
Isn't that where they're trying
to build affordable housing?

814
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,507
Broadmoor?
- Mm-hmm.

815
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:48,074
After the vets were chased
out of New Orleans

816
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:49,510
and McKinley took off

817
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:50,811
with the FEMA funds,

818
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:53,414
whole neighborhood
went into litigation.

819
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,749
Been left for dead
ever since.

820
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:58,084
City released it
six months ago.

821
00:33:58,086 --> 00:33:59,486
When Fillibert
got the permit.

822
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:01,354
City approved Fillibert
because of the vets,

823
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,856
but he wasn't the only one
with eyes on the land.

824
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:05,891
Developers been
wanting to rezone it

825
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:07,427
for commercial use for years.

826
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:08,761
Vets beat them
to the punch,

827
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:09,995
kept it residential.

828
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:11,464
So, what, it's a land grab?

829
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,465
Somebody wanted to

830
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,733
rekindle the feud

831
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:15,702
to get the vets
to leave again?

832
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:17,469
If the vets leave, city
releases the permits.

833
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:19,771
Yeah and Broadmoor
gets rebuilt,

834
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:20,939
but not for housing.

835
00:34:20,941 --> 00:34:22,240
For profits.
- Mm-hmm.

836
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:24,309
Well, any idea
who the developers are?

837
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:26,110
I think I know.

838
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:28,179
If memory serves,

839
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:30,114
before McKinley ran off,

840
00:34:30,116 --> 00:34:32,651
he put Broadmoor up
on fire sale.

841
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,485
If memory serves?

842
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:36,053
Not the point.

843
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:39,690
Keep going.

844
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:43,661
Yep, I thought so.

845
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:45,696
Company tied up in litigation--

846
00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:46,831
Aufiero Partners.

847
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:48,932
Aufiero... Mob?

848
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:50,668
Out of New York,
originally, yeah.

849
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,168
Is that how you know
about all this?

850
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,071
Not the point.
But Ramon might be.

851
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:57,674
I think the Aufieros were
connected to that ATF case

852
00:34:57,676 --> 00:34:59,876
Percy was working on
when she met him.

853

They all got busted,

855
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:05,882
but where does Ramon fit in?

856
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:07,950
He didn't get busted,
Percy made sure of that.

857
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:11,353
Long story.

858
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:13,689
There's got to be a reason why

859
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:14,923
his name never turns up,

860
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:16,558
but he always does.

861
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,193
Got him.

862
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:22,297
Ramon Vargas,

863
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:23,866
Specializes

864

under every name.

865

And always
for the Aufieros.

866
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:29,804
No wonder Percy didn't
turn him in, she had no idea.

867
00:35:29,806 --> 00:35:31,272
It could be he's the one
who's instigating the feud

868
00:35:31,274 --> 00:35:32,707
for the Aufieros.

869
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:33,708
Which means, yet again,

870
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,142
she has no idea.

Either there's a lot
of interference,

00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:43,794
any more than the vets
blew up their shop.

943
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:46,797
Somebody's trying to
set you up, both of you.

944
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,098
You pull that trigger,

945
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,401
none of it's
gonna matter.

946
00:38:53,472 --> 00:38:55,405
'Cause we won't let you do it.

947
00:38:57,276 --> 00:38:59,576
Stand down.

948
00:38:59,578 --> 00:39:00,910
Please.

949
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:19,662
Ramon, don't.

950
00:39:19,664 --> 00:39:20,663
Just give it up.

951
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:21,763
Screw you, Sunny,

952
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:23,799
or whatever the hell
your name is.

953
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:28,102
Why'd you save me?

954
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:29,937
Huh? Why'd you let me go
last time?

955
00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:31,939
Because I was stupid.

956
00:39:31,941 --> 00:39:33,541
Yeah, I thought
you were innocent, but

957
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:34,942
I won't make that
mistake again.

958
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:36,578
You don't really got
a choice this time.

959
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,945
Don't I?

960
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:41,849
FBI. Drop it or I'll shoot.

961
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:44,418
Drop it now!

962
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,320
I'd do it if I were you, Ramon,
because I promise you

963
00:39:46,322 --> 00:39:47,987
that girl ain't letting you go.

964
00:40:06,474 --> 00:40:08,674
I told you I got your back.

965

966
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,190
Where is everybody?

967
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:28,025
Pride's bar.

968
00:40:28,027 --> 00:40:30,194
He invited Hogan's MC.

969
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:31,963
He'll probably end up
hiring 'em all,

970
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:33,964
like he hires every other vet.

971
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:35,666
Can he afford to do that?
- No,

972
00:40:35,668 --> 00:40:36,667
but that's Pride.

973
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:38,869
It drives Patton crazy,

974
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:42,172
'cause he does the books.

975
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:48,011
Hey, what's this doing
in Lasalle's desk?

976
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:51,180
You ought to ask City Mouse.

977
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,582
Country Mouse.

978
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:53,949
Yeah.

979
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:00,423
<font color="#D900D9">(drawer shuts)</font>

980
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,991
What do you know?

981
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,694
Just that I'm not
gonna get involved.

982
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,030
So, you okay?

983
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:11,099
I mean, about... Ramon?

984
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,941
You should know we
matched his DNA.

985
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,945
Makes him both the killer
and the bomber.

986
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:25,780
He was at the junkyard

987
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:28,282
supplying the Niners
with nontraceable guns, too.

988
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:30,250
Well,

989
00:41:30,252 --> 00:41:32,320
I sure know how to pick 'em,
don't I?

990
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:39,393
So, now you know why I kept
avoiding the subject.

991
00:41:39,395 --> 00:41:42,061
I can't believe
how stupid I was.

992
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:44,096
Yeah, well, you're
not the first girl

993
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:45,898
to be blinded by
the Bad Boy Spell.

994
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,400
Yeah, but most other girls don't

995
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,168
almost get themselves killed
in doing it.

996
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,471
True, some of us just
live a life of shame,

997
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:52,905
kick ourselves,

998
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:55,742
run, you know.

999
00:41:55,744 --> 00:41:59,244
We might have more in common
than you think, Percy.

1000
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:03,114
I'm all ears.

1001
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:05,083
McKinley, Katrina?

1002
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:06,552
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1003
00:42:06,554 --> 00:42:07,820
That would be the bad boy

1004
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:09,254
I fell for,
before I realized.

1005
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:10,489
No.

1006
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:12,324
Yeah.
- You're McKinley's wife?

1007
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:13,659
<i>Was</i> his wife.

1008
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:16,394
- Wow.
- Left NOLA right after I left him.

1009
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:18,195
Probably should have
left sooner.

1010
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:19,731
Although I'm guessing, like you,

1011
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:22,933
we both knew who they were
all along, we just...

1012
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:25,670
didn't want to admit it.

1013
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:27,872
Well, you live
and you learn, right?

1014
00:42:28,742 --> 00:42:30,541
Hopefully.

1015
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:34,845
Hey, uh, this...

1016
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,580
wasn't us bonding, right?

1017
00:42:36,582 --> 00:42:38,147
Oh, God forbid, no.

1018
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:39,449
Good.
