29
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,698
如果你的宝宝不睡觉或是整晚在哭
If your toddler doesn't sleep and cries all night,

30
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:36,532
让你处于
it might very well be gas

31
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,067
精神崩溃边缘的
that has you on the verge

32
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:39,168
很可能是胀气
of a nervous breakdown.

33
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,737
首先 抱起你的宝宝
First, pick him or her up,

34
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:45,507
肚子冲下 轻轻拍打
stomach down, gently patting...

35
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,144
有点像橄榄球 对吗
Kind of like a football, right?

36
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:50,146
然后你轻轻地拍打他
And you pat him gently.

37
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:52,113
你甚至可以晃晃他
You can even rock him

38
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:54,316
一圈一圈地来
going round and round in circles,

39
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:58,219
像搅拌一大锅汤
like stirring a big pot of soup.

40
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:01,056
晃呀 晃呀 晃呀晃
Bob, bob, bob, bob.

41
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:03,724
哦 他长大后会变成什么
Aw, what's he gonna be when he grows up?

42
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:04,993
一个篮球吗
A basketball?

43
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:06,361
如果这样还不行的话
If all this doesn't help...

44
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:11,365
脸 头发 橄榄球
Face. Hair. Football.

45
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:14,068
家庭生活很甜蜜呀
Take it family life's just peachy.

46
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:18,805
一周前 家里就只有我一个人
A week ago, it was just me at the house.

47
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:22,042
现在多了一个整夜在哭 让我无法睡觉的孩子
Now I got a crying toddler keeping me up at night

48
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:24,111
和一个我不怎么了解的妈妈
and a mama I barely know.

49
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:26,045
你对她的了解已经能生出个孩子了
You knew her well enough to make the toddler.

50
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:29,148
还有 她每分钟都会给我发信息
Plus, she keeps texting me every minute.

51
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,650
"买吸管杯 买尿布
"Pick up sippy cups, pick up diapers.

52
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,785
买这个 买那个"
Pick up this, pick up that."

53
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:35,821
我连吸管杯是什么都不知道
I don't even know what a sippy cup is.

54
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,823
你是在寻求我的建议吗
Is this you asking me for advice?

55
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,225
因为 通常
Because, normally,

56
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:41,194
我是很乐于助人的 Lasalle 真的
I'd love to help, Lasalle, I really would,

57
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:43,695
但我很快就要回华盛顿的家了
but I'm back home in DC in about a minute and a half.

58
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:47,532
问题在于 你是唯一知道这件事的人
Except the problem is, you're the only one that knows.

59
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,401
没错
Right.

60
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,769
这确实是个问题
That is the problem.

61
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,238
有点尴尬 你不觉得吗
It's a little awkward, don't you think?

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,606
我以为你现在已经
I mean, I thought you would have told Country Mouse

63
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:55,807
告诉了那个"乡下鼠"
about it by now.

64
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,842
我才是"乡下鼠" 好吗
I'm Country Mouse, all right?

65
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,644
-Percy 她是"城里鼠" -你知道吗
- Percy, she's City Mouse. - You know what?

66
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,413
你应该和Pride谈谈这件事
You ought to talk to Pride about this.

67
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,883
他可以给你比菲尔博士更有用的建议
That man's got more homespun advice than Dr. Phil.

68
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,883
{\a6}菲尔·麦格劳：著名电视心理学咨询专家，主持著名访谈类节目"菲尔博士"

69
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,168
我听说他有一个女儿 成长得挺好
I heard he's got a daughter; she turned out all right.

70
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,820
呦呦呦 大家好
Yo, yo, yo, what's up?

71
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:12,956
Percy 嗨 你好
Percy, hey. What's up?

72
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,092
什么情况
What's up?

73
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,227
发生了什么
What's going on?

74
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:18,389
没什么
Nothing.

75
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,832
嗯 哼
Uh... huh?

76
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:37,746
和Pride谈谈
Talk to Pride.

77
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:46,021
-早上好 Sonja -嗨
- Morning, Sonja. - Hey.

78
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:48,357
-你做的够两个人喝吗 -当然
- You making enough for two? - Sure.

79
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:52,660
我来吧
I got it.

80
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:54,062
哦 好的
Oh, great.

81
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:00,935
你有心事吗
Something on your mind?

82
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:02,870
没有 我很好
No, I'm good.

83
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:07,542
你能告诉我 Lasalle怎么了吗
Okay, can you tell me what's wrong with Lasalle?

84
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:09,876
他紧张兮兮的 一直收到很多短信
He's jumpy, he's getting these texts.

85
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,978
他就像个僵尸 但他不肯告诉我怎么回事
He looks like a zombie, but he won't tell me about it.

86
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,880
最近看上去确实有点不对劲
Does seem a little bit distracted lately.

87
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:15,949
是啊 所以
Right. So.

88
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,351
"Pride谈话"安排在什么时候
When's the “Pride talking to" scheduled?

89
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:19,852
不是这么来的
Doesn't work like that.

90
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:21,154
当他准备好了
He'll come around

91
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:22,755
-他会来找我 -准备好了 好了
- when he's ready. - Ready, ready, right.

92
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:24,857
现在的情况是 他已经告诉了那位FBI的人
See, the thing is, he already told FBI.

93
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:27,326
她很显然知道这件事 所以
She's obviously hip to it, so...

94
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:28,994
我觉得他准备好了
I think he's ready.

95
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:34,900
Pride
Pride.

96
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:40,506
好 好的
Okay... Okay.

97
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:41,940
得带上咖啡走了
Got to get the coffee to go.

98
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:43,708
圣玛丽公园有一名海军死了
We got a dead sailor by St. Mary's Park.

99
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,551
Loretta在那呢
There's Loretta.

100
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:56,121
新鲜的菊苣汁
Fresh chicory...

101
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:58,623
希望你告诉我你知道的一切
in hopes that you will tell me all you know.

102
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,224
行贿就不必了 Dwayne
Bribery's not needed, Dwayne.

103
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:02,993
但鼓励一下还是很乐意的
But it's always happily encouraged.

104
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:06,763
街对面有一个很吵的摩托车节
So, across the street a rowdy motorcycle rally,

105
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:06,763
{\a6}源于欧洲的年度国际事件，通常持续七天

106
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,267
聚集了上千个"无法无天"的人
thousands of "American outlaws" in town.

107
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,068
有人伤亡 我是真的不意外
Can't say I didn't expect a casualty,

108
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,937
只不过没想到会是你的案子
just didn't expect it to be yours.

109
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,805
受害者叫Lloyd Fillibert
Well, the Vic is Lloyd Fillibert.

110
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:18,574
一级建筑海军士官 驻扎在密西西比的Gulfport
BU1 stationed in Gulfport, Mississippi.

111
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:21,344
有一份Oasis旅馆的文件
There's paperwork from the Oasis Motel.

112
00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:24,180
距离摩托车周的庆祝场地几英尺远
Feet away from Bike Week's festival grounds.

113
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:27,216
海军工兵在美国南部
Seabee was visiting for the biggest

114
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:29,118
参加最大的摩托车节
motorcycle rally in the South.

115
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,320
问题在于
Question is...

116
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:33,122
一个比赛怎么会死人呢
how'd the ride turn deadly?

117
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,589
基本情况如下
Well, here's the basics.

118
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:37,792
一个小口径子弹
It's a small caliber round.

119
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:40,061
从胸腔后面射入
It entered through the rear of the rib cage,

120
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,963
穿透了这位可怜人的心脏
perforated the poor soul's heart.

121
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,165
一枪毙命
It was a clean shot.

122
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,299
很快就死了
Was dead in seconds.

123
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,767
从细节来看
That kind of an eye for detail,

124
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,269
这不是一起意外的枪击事件
we're not looking at an accidental shooting.

125
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:49,437
不排除公路暴怒
Try road rage.

126
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:49,437
{\a6}指司机之间因驾驶问题而极度愤怒或动粗

127
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,572
警方说 受害者当时在排队参加街头赛车
NOPD tells us your Vic was lined up for a street race.

128
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:53,440
这就可以解释那些焦橡胶了
Well, that would explain the burnt rubber.

129
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:56,310
我估计有 20个摩托手吧
I'm guessing maybe... 20 bikers?

130
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:58,579
如果Fillibert是被近距离射杀
And if Fillibert was shot at close range...

131
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,914
凶手就在他们之中
The killer was one of them.

132
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,417
摩托车赛在新奥尔良举行
Motorcycle race goes down in New Orleans,

133
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,985
应该会有围观者 Chris
there's gonna be onlookers, Chris.

134
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:06,253
我已经排查过了
Well, I already checked.

135
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,354
目击者们要么逃离了现场
Either the witnesses fled from the scene

136
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:10,223
要么就是选择性失忆了
or they have a case of selective memory.

137
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:12,425
可能是怕会出卖不该得罪的帮派
May have been afraid to rat on the wrong club.

138
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:14,060
摩托帮派无所不在
MCs can go anywhere

139
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:15,161
从无害的业余体力劳动者
from harmless weekend warriors

140
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:16,929
到复杂的犯罪集团
to elaborate crime syndicates.

141
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,764
我在ATF知道的
Seen my share at ATF to know.

142
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,764
{\a6}酒精烟草枪支管理局

143
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:21,501
保持沉默是明智的
It's smart to keep quiet.

144
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:26,438
受害者是兄弟连的成员
Victim was a member of the Brothers at Arms.

145
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:30,809
这个帮派在新奥尔良有很长的历史了
Club's got a long-standing history in New Orleans.

146
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:33,245
成立之初有一个崇高的想法
Started as an honorable idea.

147
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,847
被剥夺权利的老兵们没有家和人生目标
Disenfranchised vets without home or purpose

148
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:38,250
他们联合起来重建家园和人生目标
banded together to give them both.

149
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:39,851
本是卡特里娜飓风之后做好事的
Supposed to do good after Katrina.

150
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:41,219
但是
But...

151
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,687
其它帮派不让他们到自己的地盘
Others didn't want them on their turf.

152
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,555
没错 因为那块地盘是骑行帮
Yeah, 'cause the turf belonged to the Niners.

153
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:46,624
这个骑行帮不干好事
Bad motorcycle gang.

154
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,659
交易毒品 走私武器
Drug dealing, trafficking weapons...

155
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:51,128
我在ATF的时候追查过他们
I used to go after them when I was with ATF.

156
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,597
想把他们一网打尽 可最后发现
Tried to root them out, but turned out

157
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:53,664
这个组织的根基非常牢固
they were too well entrenched.

158
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,266
是的 还很聪明
Yeah, smart, too.

159
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:57,735
不知用了什么手段 让那帮老兵看起来像是坏人
Somehow made the vets look like they were the bad guys.

160
00:06:57,737 --> 00:06:59,603
当时有些人认为
Didn't help back then that some folks thought

161
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:01,904
所有的老兵都是残缺和暴力的
all vets were damaged goods and violent.

162
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:04,274
即便他们真的是去帮忙重建 也没能改变这种想法吗
Even though they were really here to help rebuild?

163
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:07,377
骑行帮把他们视作威胁 只想让他们离开
Niners viewed them as a threat, just wanted them gone.

164
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:09,346
让他们卷入斗殴 无辜的人受了伤
Sucked them into a fight, innocent people got hurt,

165
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:11,881
而那些老兵们为一切的动乱
and the vets took the blame

166
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,049
背了黑锅
for all the unrest.

167
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:14,684
这座城市 太轻易评判
The city... quick to judge,

168
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:16,518
-所以他们离开了 -而现在
- so they left. - And now this

169
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,820
这是一个温暖的欢迎仪式 说曹操曹操就到
for a warm welcome. Speak of the devil.

170
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:21,557
骑行帮的人来了
There's the Niners right there.

171
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:26,328
哦
Oh.

172
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:33,468
他没看见我吧
He didn't spot me, did he?

173
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,602
谁
Who?

174
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,170
我想她说的是那个小帅哥
I think she's talking about the cute guy,

175
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:39,707
机车上的纹身男 27岁左右的约翰尼·德普
tribals on a tank, Johnny Depp circa 1990.

176
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:39,707
{\a6}1963年生的美国影视演员

177
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,342
我猜你认识他吧
Know him I take it?

178
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:42,410
对 算是吧
Yeah, sort of.

179
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:44,011
他曾经是ATF的线人
He was an ATF informant.

180
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,045
Ramon
Ramon.

181
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,581
Ramon
Ramon?

182
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,683
他是骑行帮的人吗
Is he a Niner?

183
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,950
不 他以前制造过
No, he used to build

184
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,852
定制摩托车 至少以前是
custom bikes... or at least he used to.

185
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,621
他很可能是来参加摩托车节的
He's probably here for the rally.

186
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,989
好吧
Okay.

187
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:59,293
Percy Gregorio 深挖两个帮派
Percy, Gregorio, deep-dive both clubs,

188
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:00,694
告诉我们所有相关人员的情况
get us caught up on everybody involved.

189
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:01,895
我和Chris去查明
Chris and I are gonna go figure out

190
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:03,029
受害者的情况
what happened to the victim.

191
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:04,063
看看是谁想杀死他
See who'd want

192
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,399
以及原因
him dead and why.

193
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,599
别把车刮了 北方佬
Don't scratch it, Yankee.

194
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:10,202
怎么啦
What?

195
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,405
过于随意的回答
Overly casual response,

196
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:13,839
单边耸肩
one-sided shoulder shrug,

197
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:15,040
声音低沉
lowered voice.

198
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:16,642
我看到这些就知道是在掩饰
I know a good cover when I see it.

199
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:18,010
你说啥
I'm sorry?

200
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:20,446
得了吧 帅哥线人 Ramon
Oh, please, hot informant, Ramon?

201
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:21,681
我是个侧写员
I'm a profiler,

202
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:22,715
记得吗
remember?

203
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:24,316
记得 明显不是个很好的侧写员
Yeah, obviously not a good one.

204
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:26,318
我来开车
I'm driving.

205
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:38,463
我不是喜欢打听的人
I'm not one to pry,

206
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:40,298
Christopher
Christopher.

207
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,232
这不关我的事
It's none of my business...

208
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:43,667
除非影响到了工作
unless it's something that affects work,

209
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,035
但如果你遇到了什么事 需要
but you got something going on and you need

210
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:47,771
谈谈的话
to talk...

211
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:49,340
我能搞定 King
I can handle it, King.

212
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,341
别担心
Don't worry.

213
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:52,343
我不是在担心
I'm not worrying.

214
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:55,245
只是 有需要可以找我
Just... here if you need me.

215
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:59,615
好吧 不过这可能需要长谈
Well... just might be a... bigger conversation is all.

216
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:01,150
我还在
I'm still...

217
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:02,985
试着解决它
trying to sort it all out and...

218
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:04,053
我想以正确的方式
I want to do this

219
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:06,456
来解决
the right way.

220
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,290
想听听建议 不过
Keep an open mind, but...

221
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:10,827
具体点会更有帮助
Specifics would be helpful.

222
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:14,363
我想我可能做爸爸了 King
I think I might be a dad, King.

223
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:16,598
或者说
Or I mean...

224
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,167
我做爸爸了
I am a dad.

225
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:21,603
我对此一无所知 直到
I had no idea until this...

226
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:24,606
这个女人带着孩子出现
woman shows up with a baby boy.

227
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:26,241
哦
Oh.

228
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:29,177
没错 就是这样
Yeah, exactly.

229
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,645
像我说的 说来话长
Like I said, a bigger conversation.

230
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:33,881
我们到了
Well, we're here.

231
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:35,383
等会再说
Hold that thought.

232
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:42,256
老兵们像是要去什么地方
Vets look like they're going somewhere.

233
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:44,625
暂时还没出发
Not yet they're not.

234
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:47,428
别紧张 Chris 你在老兵面前
Now, easy, Chris. You come up on the vets

235
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,195
先拔枪的话
barrel first,

236
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:50,497
就不可能得到配合了
lose any chance of cooperation.

237
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:52,164
相信我
Trust me.

238
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,477
哦 你现在对我们亮徽章了
Oh, you badging us now?

239
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,545
Hogan队长
Captain Hogan.

240
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:07,679
我的搭档
My partner,

241
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:08,881
Christopher Lasalle
Christopher Lasalle.

242
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,251
到这里
Not here

243
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:15,353
不是来逮捕的 只是
to arrest anyone, just...

244
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:17,355
只是想谈谈
just want to talk.

245
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:20,426
你怎么样 很久没见了
How you been? A long time.

246
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:22,560
还没久到忘记
Well, not long enough to forget how cops

247
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:24,061
我们的一个兄弟被杀后
come investigating us

248
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:26,831
警察是怎么调查我们的
when it's one of our own getting killed.

249
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,166
城市派你们来赶我们走吗 Pride
City sent you to make us leave, Pride?

250
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:31,936
很多事情做错了 我承认
A lot of things went wrong, I admit.

251
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,204
没错 我们像一群罪犯一样
Yeah, it did. We got chased out of town like a bunch

252
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:35,673
被人赶出城里 这都是因为
of criminals all because

253
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:39,043
新奥尔良警方不敢将真正的罪犯绳之以法
NOPD was too afraid to take on the real outlaws.

254
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,209
我们不是新奥尔良警局的警察
We're not NOPD.

255
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,712
我们是来问点事情的
Here for information,

256
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:43,747
不是来控告谁的
not accusations.

257
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:45,715
我们需要知道你们为什么回来
Need to know why you came back.

258
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:49,719
好吗 这也许能帮我们查出是谁杀了你们的人
Okay? It might help us find out who killed your man.

259
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:52,121
省点纳税人的钱吧 警长
Save the tax dollars, Sheriff.

260
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:54,591
骑行帮杀了Fillibert 就这么简单
Niners killed Fillibert. Easy as that.

261
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:56,459
你怎么如此确定
And how are you so sure?

262
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:00,963
我们帮是回来参加摩托车节的
My club came back for the rally.

263
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:03,098
原以为十年过去了 我们也许可以重新开始
Thought after ten years, maybe we'd start over,

264
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,167
这个地方依然需要重建
places still need rebuilding.

265
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,202
我们在还没过州界的时候
Barely crossed state line 'fore we hear

266
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:09,204
就听说骑行帮在计划着什么事
that the Niners are planning something.

267
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:10,539
肯定是他们中的一个
Now, one of 'em must've

268
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,374
说服他去参加他们的比赛
convinced him to run in their race

269
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:14,776
作为和解
as a-a peace offering.

270
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:17,545
结果Fillibert就被杀了
Got Fillibert shot instead.

271
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,180
他在参加骑行帮的比赛吗
He was racing the Niners?

272
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:22,416
包围着他 十比一 然后他们中的一个杀了他
Surrounded him, ten to one. Then one of them killed him.

273
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:27,555
这次我不会等法律来
I'm not waiting on the law to do the right thing

274
00:11:27,557 --> 00:11:29,056
-主持公道了 -好吧
- this time. - Okay,

275
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:30,924
你们想重新开始吧
you want to make a fresh start?

276
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:33,594
你们不想被称作罪犯吧
You don't want to be called criminals?

277
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:36,296
如果你们出去报复他们
You go out there, retaliate,

278
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:37,831
你们就真成罪犯了
that's all you're gonna be.

279
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:41,468
我知道你们曾经被不公正地对待
Know you've been mistreated in the past.

280
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,604
这不会改变什么
That doesn't make this right.

281
00:11:43,606 --> 00:11:46,439
你得给我个机会 Hogan
Got to give me a chance here, Hogan.

282
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:48,941
让我们来调查是谁杀了你的人
Let us find out who killed your man.

283
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:51,410
我们会将他绳之以法
We'll bring him to justice.

284
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,815
你最好说到做到
You better.

285
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,571
你还是应该
Still, you should probably

286
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,805
找个时间告诉Percy发生了什么
tell Percy what's going on at some point.

287
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,408
她很担心 希望你没事
She's concerned, hopes you're okay.

288
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,510
我知道应该告诉她
Hey, I know I should.

289
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,112
但我怕她会鄙视我的愚蠢
But I'm scared Percy's gonna whup my butt for being stupid.

290
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:30,714
有可能
Well, she might.

291
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,517
听着 这事不好办
Listen, this is a tough one.

292
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,786
你会解决好的
You'll figure it out.

293
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,454
好了 关于骑行帮
All right. About the Niners.

294
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,055
-嗯 -我知道他们有
- Yeah. - I know they got

295
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:41,090
犯罪前科 而且他们和老兵之间
a rap sheet and there's a lot of bad blood

296
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:42,692
有不少不怀好意的人
between them and the vets,

297
00:12:42,694 --> 00:12:44,761
但你真的认为Fillibert的死
but do you really think Fillibert's the casualty

298
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,596
-是因为十年的仇恨吗 -很难
- of a ten-year-old grudge? - It's hard

299
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,965
不让人那么想 基于他被杀的方式和地点
not to consider it, based on how and where he was killed.

300
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,701
还有 你凭什么认为骑行帮的人会和我们谈
Still, why do you think the Niners are gonna talk to us?

301
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,803
因为他们不希望在他们与老兵们的事情之外
'Cause they don't want the law up and in their business

302
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,171
再牵扯更多法律纠纷
any more than they do the vets.

303
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:56,572
我只知道我们得
All I know is we got to figure out

304
00:12:56,574 --> 00:12:57,539
在事情升温以前
what's going on

305
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,575
弄清楚发生了什么
before things escalate.

306
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:30,932
谢了 队长 非常感谢
Thanks, Chief. Appreciate it.

307
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:33,655
消防队长排除了
Marshal's ruling out

308
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:35,957
意外爆炸的可能
any accidental explosion.

309
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:39,126
Sebastian在里面快勘验完了 可能有些发现
Sebastian's almost done inside, thinks he might have something.

310
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:41,396
-伤亡人数多少 -五人 其中两人有生命危险
- How many casualties? - Five, two critical.

311
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:42,142
全是骑行帮的成员吗
All Niners?

312
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,464
是的 很明显他们当时在里面开会
Yeah, apparently they were holding a meeting inside.

313
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:46,377
这说明 干这事的人
Which means whoever did this...

314
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:47,936
知道他们会在这儿
Knew they'd be here.

315
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:51,304
我知道你不想听 但是 King 也许是老兵
I know you don't want to hear it, King, but maybe the vets...

316
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:53,807
-可能是他们自己主持正义 -我知道
- Could've taken justice in their own hands. - I know.

317
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,409
但这说不通
Doesn't make sense, though.

318
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:57,177
如果Hogan已经计划好这么做
If Hogan had already planned this,

319
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,180
为什么让我们过来 目击这一切
why send us over here so we could see it all?

320
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:02,549
嘿 就是你
Hey! You!

321
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,551
现在这个样子 你们要怎么处理
What are you gonna do about this, huh?

322
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:05,472
对做这事的混蛋们 你们抓还是不抓
You gonna arrest these bastards or not?

323
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:06,354
Morrow
Morrow.

324
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:08,855
-你认识他吗 -骑行帮的头儿
- You know him? Leader of the Niners.

325
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:10,757
你需要冷静下来 别急
You need to calm down, take it easy.

326
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:12,725
你知道你负责这件案子
I figured it'd be you working on this case.

327
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:16,061
还是像十年前那样 你我都清楚是谁做的
Just like ten years ago, huh? Both know damn well who did it.

328
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,531
我们不会过早下结论 就像我们也不会过早判定
We're not jumping to conclusions, just like we're not jumping to conclusions

329
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:19,980
是谁枪杀了他们的人
about who shot one of their men either.

330
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:21,702
你在保护他们吗
You protecting them?

331
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:23,468
是这样吗 就因为他们是老兵吗
Is that what this is? Just because they're vets?

332
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,003
-这和他们是老兵无关 -嘿
- This has nothing to do with them being... - Hey!

333
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:26,838
嘿 我们来控制这件事
Hey, hey. We got it under control.

334
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,273
行吗
All right?

335
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,875
所以 麻烦你退后
So, why don't you just back off?

336
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,384
他应该感到感激 他很幸运活下来了
He ought to be more grateful. He's lucky to be alive.

337
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:41,552
你发现了什么 Sebastian
What'd you find, Sebastian?

338
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:43,421
大部分是弹片
Uh, mostly shrapnel.

339
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,155
看上去像是来自某种引爆装置
Looks like it came from some kind of detonator.

340
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:46,757
我认为是简易爆炸装置
I'm thinking improvised explosives device.

341
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,225
简易爆炸装置
IED.

342
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:49,693
关于爆炸物有什么发现
Anything on the explosives?

343
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:51,495
有 实际上 我最后又用了
Yeah. Matter of fact, got to finally use

344
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:54,131
我的激光诱导分解光谱
my laser-induced breakdown spectroscope again.

345
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:55,833
检测出了现场的爆炸物
It identifies explosives on site.

346
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:58,367
还实现了我这辈子使用激光枪的梦想
Also fulfills my lifelong dream of wielding a laser gun.

347
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:00,537
-它到底检测出了什么 -这个嘛
- What exactly did it identify? - Well,

348
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:03,506
硝化甘油基底 吸附剂和稳定剂
given the nitroglycerin base, sorbents, and stabilizers,

349
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:05,274
像是老式的炸药
it looks like old-school dynamite.

350
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:08,277
现在只用来爆破
Used mostly just for demolition these days.

351
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,279
的确爆破了
Demolished it is.

352
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:11,815
说说情况
Tell me things.

353
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:13,215
有好消息和坏消息
Well, there's good news and bad news.

354
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:14,783
就不让你选了
Gonna spare you the choice.

355
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:17,586
ATF依然把骑行帮划为摩托车帮派
ATF still classifies the Niners as a motorcycle gang.

356
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:20,522
现在他们中的两人被指控谋杀
Two of 'em are up on murder charges as we speak.

357
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:22,658
FBI还开展了诱捕行动
FBI also shows several attempted sting ops

358
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,059
针对诈骗指控
on racketeering charges,

359
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:25,327
虽然目前还没什么收获
though nothing's stuck so far.

360
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:26,962
老兵那边有什么发现
Anything on the vets?

361
00:15:26,964 --> 00:15:28,964
好消息 除了几次酒吧斗殴以外
That's the good news. Other than a few bar fights,

362
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:30,499
他们没有犯罪记录
they check out clean.

363
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,266
没错 实际上 市政厅记录显示
Yeah, in fact, city hall shows

364
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:35,035
Fillbert在半年前获得了一项许可
Fillibert pulled up a permit six months ago.

365
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:36,904
显然老兵们当时计划帮助修建
Apparently the vets were planning to help build

366
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:39,039
位于Broadmoor的低价住房
affordable housing in Broadmoor.

367
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,240
Broadmoor就是十年前
Broadmoor's where they tried

368
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:42,176
-他们要盖房子的地方 -是的
- to build ten years ago. - Yeah.

369
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:44,011
就在那个混蛋偷了卡特琳娜飓风基金后
Right after that jerk stole the Katrina funds.

370
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:45,212
McKinley
McKinley.

371
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:47,414
你怎么知道McKinley
How do you know about McKinley?

372
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,815
说来话长
Long story.

373
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,316
有没有可能是
Any chance

374
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:52,352
Fillbert的许可给了老兵们
Fillibert's permit gave the vets access

375
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:54,387
获得爆破炸药的途径
to demolition explosives?

376
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,455
正在查
Looking into it.

377
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:02,696
有了 显示有上周的提货单 为什么
Here. Shows the order of a pickup last week. Why?

378
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:04,664
那是炸了骑行帮店铺的炸药吗
That what blew up the Niners' shop?

379
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:08,300
你觉得这是老兵为Fillibert报仇吗
You thinking the vets retaliated for Fillibert?

380
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,802
所有线索都指向这个方向
Every sign's pointing in that direction.

381
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:13,506
只是 那说不通啊
It just... doesn't make sense though.

382
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:16,375
看看Loretta在Fillibert的尸检中有什么发现
See where Loretta's at on Fillibert's autopsy.

383
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:18,176
也许我们可以把子弹与枪匹配起来
Maybe we can match bullet to gun.

384
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,245
Chris会去医院 调查受害者们知道些什么
Chris'll go to the hospital, find out what the vics know.

385
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,314
-你回办公室吗 -不了
- Coming back to the squad room? - No.

386
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:25,383
我再去拜访老兵 这次要带着搜查令去
Pay another visit to the vets. This time with a warrant.

387
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,785
我们得抓紧 在事情失控之前
We need to hustle here. Bring in Fillibert's killer

388
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,588
抓到杀死FIllibert和制造爆炸的凶手
and the bomber before things get out of control.

389
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,189
谢谢
Thanks.

390
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,901
嘿 你在这里做什么
Hey! What are you doing here?

391
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:50,206
你应该去抓住杀死Fillibert的凶手
You are supposed to be arresting Fillibert's killer!

392
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,576
我还在调查此案
I'm still investigating that.

393
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:57,379
同时也在调查骑行帮店铺爆炸案的凶手
Also investigating who blew up the Niners' bike shop.

394
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:58,748
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

395
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,983
但愿这话是真的
Well, I hope that's true.

396
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:03,385
因为很多人都受伤了
'Cause a lot of people got hurt.

397
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:06,321
我现在只知道
All I know so far is that, uh,

398
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:09,759
那里用过爆破炸药
demolition explosives were used over there.

399
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,161
噢 又急着下结论了 是吗
Oh, jumping to conclusions again, huh?

400
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:14,228
就像其他警察一样
Par the course for you people.

401
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,797
只是在收集证据
Just gathering evidence.

402
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,632
但我得告诉你
But I got to tell you,

403
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:19,801
如果你和你的人没有这么做
if you or your boys didn't do it,

404
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:22,971
就是有人用心良苦 让一切看起来像是你们做的
somebody's working awful hard to make it look like you did.

405
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:27,208
也许 是又历史重演了吗
Maybe, uh, history repeating itself again?

406
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,445
也许吧 证明你们没有做的唯一方法
Maybe. Only way to prove you didn't retaliate, though,

407
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:34,915
就是确定两边的炸药不匹配
is to make sure that the explosives don't match.

408
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:38,485
证据 让你们摆脱嫌疑
Evidence. That'll square you away.

409
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:42,990
你有搜查令吗
You got a warrant?

410
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:48,461
我需要搜查令吗
Do I need one?

411
00:17:57,238 --> 00:17:59,238
看好了
There you go.

412
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,374
为了以防万一 我带着呢
I brought one just in case.

413
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:04,510
现在我们已经说清楚了
Just so we're clear.

414
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:08,614
如果两边的炸药匹配
If this comes back a match,

415
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:12,818
下次我会带着逮捕令过来
next time I'll come back with arrest warrants.

416
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:23,260
只是聊聊
Just saying,

417
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,496
-你知道我知道了 -我知道你知道什么了
- you know I know. - I know you know what?

418
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:27,397
有关这个Ramon
That there's more to this Ramon thing

419
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,899
你有事瞒着没说 而你越假装没事
than you're letting on to, and the more you pretend

420
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,070
我越肯定有事
there's not, the more I know there is.

421
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:32,570
女人啊 你需要有点生活
Girl, you need to get a life.

422
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,739
抱歉 我的生活在华盛顿
Sorry, my life's back in DC.

423
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,774
-这里只有工作 -听着
- This is all I got. - Look.

424
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:40,309
我和ATF一起查件案子 武器运输案
I worked a case with ATF, an arms pipeline,

425
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:42,411
一个摩托车团伙干的
uh, run by another motorcycle gang.

426
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,980
Ramon帮他们造了些摩托车
Ramon built them some bikes,

427
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:45,882
我利用他进入团伙内部 就这样
and I used him to get in, that's it.

428
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:47,283
-你和他上床了 -什么
- You screwed him. - What?

429
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:49,418
你准备否认吗
You gonna say you didn't?

430
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,987
好吧
Okay.

431
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:53,589
你先告诉我 你是怎么知道
Well, first do you want to tell me how you knew

432
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,991
McKinley偷了卡特琳娜飓风基金
about McKinley stealing those Katrina funds?

433
00:18:55,993 --> 00:18:58,193
哈
Uh-huh.

434
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:00,996
看来不只我一个人有秘密
Yeah. Looks like I'm not the only one with secrets.

435
00:19:00,998 --> 00:19:02,497
开始工作 好吗
Work. Shall we?

436
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,367
子弹是0.22口径的
The bullet was a .22 caliber,

437
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:08,037
然而更有趣的是我在枪伤里面
but more interesting is a piece of fiber

438
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,674
发现的一块纤维
I found inside the bullet wound.

439
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:16,410
我猜 纤维不是Fillibert的衣服上的
So, not from what Fillibert was wearing, I take it?

440
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:17,912
不是 上面还有少量的
No, and it had trace amounts

441
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,814
射击残留物 这意味着
of gunshot residue on it, which means...

442
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,949
是开枪后留下的 凶手衣服上的么
It came from the discharge. Shooter's clothing?

443
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:22,984
-理论上是这样 -对
- That's the theory. - Yeah.

444
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,351
杀手出现在Fillibert面前
Killer rolls up to Fillibert,

445
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:25,820
枪藏在他的夹克里面
gun concealed under his jacket,

446
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:27,655
-扣动扳机 -子弹穿过衣服
- pulls the trigger... Shoots through it,

447
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:28,856
给我们留下了碎屑
delivering us the breadcrumb.

448
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:29,956
还有
And...

449
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:30,991
呃
Hmm?

450
00:19:30,993 --> 00:19:32,392
亲爱的 最重要的事情
The most important thing, dear.

451
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:34,061
对 我也许能恢复触碰DNA
Yes. Uh, I might be able to recover

452
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:37,497
确定凶手身份 我只是需要一点时间
touch DNA and ID your killer. I just need a little time.

453
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:40,067
我们没有太多时间 有什么
Something we don't have much of. Is there anything

454
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:42,302
你现在能告诉我们的 以便我们缩小嫌犯的范围
you can tell us now, help us narrow down the suspect pool?

455
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:44,705
可疑的时尚选择也许有用
Well, the questionable fashion choice might help.

456
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:46,506
纤维来自于一条金色的金属线
The fiber came from a gold metallic thread,

457
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:47,773
这意味着 要么是
which means either it was

458
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:50,375
-利伯雷斯 要么是... -那个
- Liberace, or... - The one motorcycle gang

459
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:50,375
{\a6}美国钢琴演奏家，常以金色夹克和大量珠宝打扮自己

460
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,877
有黄金臂章的摩托帮
flying gold patches.

461
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:53,112
骑行帮
The Niners.

462
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:55,380
我在医院
<i>All I heard</i>

463
00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:58,483
听到的都是骑行帮有多想报复
from the hospital was how bad the Niners want payback.

464
00:19:58,485 --> 00:20:00,920
从我收集到的信息看 老兵们也是如此
Well, vets do, too, from everything I can gather.

465
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:02,788
但如果是他们炸了骑行帮的店铺
But if they're the ones that blew up the Niners' shop,

466
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,255
那他们已经报复过了
then they already got their payback.

467
00:20:04,257 --> 00:20:06,157
除非不是他们炸的
Unless they're not the ones that blew it up.

468
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,325
我不知道还有谁会这么做
Well, I don't know who else could've.

469
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:08,893
老兵们准备要背锅了
The vets are loaded for bear.

470
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:10,895
我们查到匹配的炸药了吗
Do we have an explosives match yet?

471
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:14,032
-Sebastian还在分析 -很难认为
- Sebastian's still analyzing. - It's hard to think

472
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,967
-这不是报复 -是的
- it's not just an eye for an eye. - Yeah,

473
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:18,002
而且事情只会更糟
and it's only gonna get worse, too.

474
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:21,105
我们不能袖手旁观 让两个摩托帮
We can't stand by and let two motorcycle clubs

475
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:23,406
自行解决矛盾
take justice into their own hands.

476
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:25,976
你是指 继续自行解决吧
You mean <i>continue</i> taking it into their own hands?

477
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,745
问题是 我们没有足够的线索来得出
Problem is, we don't have enough leads yet to draw

478
00:20:27,747 --> 00:20:30,214
任何结论 更不用说实行逮捕了
any conclusions, let alone make any arrests.

479
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:31,982
下一步轮到骑行帮了
Well, next move is the Niners.

480
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:33,817
现在 在我们得到线索前
Now, how do we stop them

481
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:36,253
该怎么阻止他们呢
before we get any more leads?

482
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:37,954
Ramon
Ramon?

483
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:39,222
什么
What?

484
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:41,490
你的旧线人
Your old informant?

485
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,893
我们看到他跟骑行帮有来往 不是吗
I mean, we saw him running with the Niners, didn't we?

486
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:45,895
可能是我们唯一的方法 加上Percy已经有一个卧底身份了
Might be our only way in, plus Percy already has a cover.

487
00:20:45,897 --> 00:20:48,530
除了卧底没有更快的方法了
No way we get a UC in any faster.

488
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:50,499
我不知道
I don't know.

489
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:54,303
只是说说而已 她有卧底身份和路子
Just sayin', she's got both the cover and the chops to do it.

490
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:57,038
谢谢 我想想
Well, thanks. I think.

491
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,173
你认为你的卧底身份还是好的吗
You think your cover's still good?

492
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,607
是的
Yeah, I mean...

493
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,777
逮捕进行的时候我早就离开了
I was long gone when the raid went down.

494
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:04,312
而且 Ramon不是我们逮捕的帮派中的一员
Besides, Ramon wasn't part of the gang we busted,

495
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:06,148
他只是我的消息来源
he was just my source.

496
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,416
他不可能知道我的身份
There's no way he made me.

497
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:10,986
他能为我们提供有价值的信息
He could get us valuable information,

498
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:13,053
也许甚至可以阻止这个事件升级
maybe even enough to keep this thing from escalating,

499
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,294
但是如果你感觉不好 那我不...
but if you're not comfortable, then I don't...

500
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:15,393
不 没有
No, no.

501
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,959
Gregorio是对的
Gregorio's right.

502
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,427
我去卧底
I'll do it.

503
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:21,996
好吧 她得带窃听器
All right. She has to wear a wire.

504
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:25,099
一旦情况异常 我们必须把她救出来
We have to be able to pull her out if things get squirrely.

505
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:26,066
同意
Agreed.

506
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,401
Gregorio
Gregorio.

507
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,002
-你和Patton给她做后援 -等等
- You and Patton back her up. - Wait,

508
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,503
-为什么是Gregorio -也许是因为
- why Gregorio? - Maybe because

509
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:33,840
我在FBI做过很多次后援
I've done a million backups already at FBI.

510
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:36,475
别担心 我会保护你
Don't worry, I got your back.

511
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:39,846
那好 我们会在外围跟进这个案子
All right, we'll work the case from outside.

512
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:42,148
有任何消息马上告诉我们
You let us know the moment you hear anything.

513
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,283
收到
Copy that.

514
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:45,218
去带窃听器
Go get wired.

515
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:51,523
我得说 如果是我来做她的后援
Just gotta say, I'd feel a lot more comfortable

516
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:52,958
我会感觉更安心些
if I were backing her up.

517
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,059
好了 Chris 我想你现在手头的
Yeah, well, I think you got enough

518
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:55,560
事情已经够多了
on your plate right now, Chris.

519
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:58,931
再说 她们两个多吵吵架
Besides, as much as those two bark at each other,

520
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,632
就会处得好了
they're good together.

521
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:03,234
她们只是还不知道罢了
They just don't know it yet.

00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:05,502

What?

528
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:43,105
你在这个镇上停一辆FBI的监察车
You park an FBI surveillance van in this town,

Come on, I deserve to know, Sunny.

561
00:24:20,974 --> 00:24:22,273
你和我 我们曾如此亲密
You and me, we got close,

562
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:25,944
然后你就消失了
and then you just... up and disappeared.

563
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:30,280
你甚至没有说过再见
You never even said good-bye.

564
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:35,886
我知道 对不起
I know. I'm sorry.

565
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:37,687
尽管如此 你当时离开
It was probably a good thing

566
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:39,389
可能是件好事
you left when you did, though.

567
00:24:39,391 --> 00:24:40,858
之后所有人都被捕了
Everybody got busted right afterwards.

568
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,860
很显然 有人背叛了我们
Apparently, somebody ratted us out.

569
00:24:42,862 --> 00:24:44,327
是的 但你没有被捕 不是吗
Yeah, but you didn't get busted, right?

570
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:46,996
没有 多亏了你
No, thanks to you.

571
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:48,564
关于这个叫
How much did Percy say

572
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:51,000
-Ramon的家伙 Percy讲了多少 -显然不够多
- about this Ramon dude, exactly? - Not enough, obviously.

573
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:52,501
嗯 但你没做什么错事儿吧
Yeah, but you didn't do anything wrong, right?

574
00:24:52,503 --> 00:24:54,871
你只是给他们修修摩托车 对吧
You were just building bikes for them, right?

575
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:56,538
-差不多 -看起来Percy隐瞒的
- Yeah, pretty much. - Yo, looks like Percy's hiding

576
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,673
还不只是勾搭的事
more than just a hook-up.

577
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,208
别忘了
Neglected to mention

578
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,044
Ramon没被抓到 是因为Percy救了他
that Ramon didn't get busted because she saved him.

579
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:03,082
你打电话给Pride吗
You calling Pride?

580
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:05,014
不 打给FBI 我觉得这小子有问题
No, FBI. I got a bad feeling about this guy.

581
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:06,447
我要明确知道我们面对的是什么人
I want to know exactly who we're dealing with,

582
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:08,784
这也是为了Percy好 就是说
for Percy's sake. Which means...

583
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:09,851
如果你还没觉得有必要
if you haven't felt the urge

584
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:11,452
黑进ATF的数据库
to hack into the ATF database,

585
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:13,155
拿到卧底行动资料的话
get access to our undercover ops,

586
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:15,257
现在正是好时机 我就随口一说
now would be the time-- just sayin'.

587
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:18,559
但那么做不是非法的吗 Gregorio探员
But isn't that illegal, Agent Gregorio?

588
00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:21,628
不问也不说 对么
Don't ask, don't tell, right?

589
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,963
那真的是伤了我的心
That really did a number on me.

590
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:25,499
我吃不下 睡不着
I didn't eat, couldn't sleep.

591
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:27,268
我骑车走遍了德州 内华达州
You know I was riding around Texas, Nevada,

592
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,203
一直到加州 就为了找你
all the way out to California trying to find you?

593
00:25:30,673 --> 00:25:34,374
我现在就在这儿啊 不是吗
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

594
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:40,180
迟到总比不到好
Well, it's better late than never.

595
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:48,321
你不能一直躲着她
Can't keep avoiding her, you know.

596
00:25:48,323 --> 00:25:49,488
我知道 但是她也不能
Yeah, I know, but she can't keep

597
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,589
没完没了地打电话
calling all the time, either.

598
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,891
我得工作啊
I gotta focus on work.

599
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:54,759
工作不是借口 Chris
Work isn't always an excuse, Chris.

600
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,095
你对这个女孩有多了解
How well you know this girl?

601
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,232
一般
Not very.

602
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:01,800
这就是问题所在
I mean, that's the problem.

603
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:03,869
你知道Savannah死后
Look, you know how I used to be,

604
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:05,237
我成了什么样子
after Savannah's death.

605
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,105
那是段黑暗的日子 到处约炮
It was dark times, sleeping around.

606
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,373
这不是什么光彩的事情
It's not something I'm proud of.

607
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,842
我也迷失了自己
And it's not who I am anymore, either.

608
00:26:10,844 --> 00:26:12,476
但是
But...

609
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:18,382
我真的不知道该怎么办
I honestly don't know what to do.

610
00:26:19,418 --> 00:26:24,088
可我也不能放手不管啊
Still, I can't just... walk away.

611
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,924
但我不知道自己有没有准备好
But I don't know if I'm ready for all this.

612
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:29,625
我必须得问一句
I gotta ask--

613
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:30,927
你确定孩子是你的么
you sure the baby's yours?

614
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:33,230
他长得很像我
Boy, he looks like me.

615
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:36,532
时间也合得上
And the math definitely works.

616
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:37,968
这种情况唯一的解决方法就是
Then the only way to deal with something like this

617
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,169
直接面对
is head-on.

618
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:42,172
这对孩子的母亲来说也不容易
It can't be easy for the mom, either.

619
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:45,440
但是有一点
But one thing's for sure...

620
00:26:45,442 --> 00:26:47,943
你不能逃避
it's not something you can avoid.

621
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,379
给她打电话吧
Call her back.

622
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:52,614
我去Sebastian那边看看
I'll see where Sebastian's at.

623
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:03,958
我不会给你压力的 Sebastian
Hate to pressure you, Sebastian, all right?

624
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,693
你有什么就说什么吧
I'll take anything you got.

625
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:07,595
我得到的结果 你可能不会喜欢
Well, what I got, I don't think you're gonna like.

626
00:27:07,597 --> 00:27:09,764
我把简易爆炸装置进行了重组
I reassembled most of the IED,

627
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:12,200
要么嫌疑犯掌握了原始的谷歌技术
and either your bomber's got pristine Googling skills,

628
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:14,002
要么他有很强的军事背景
or he's got a military background.

629
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:15,836
好吧 关于爆炸物呢
Okay, well, what about the explosives?

630
00:27:15,838 --> 00:27:17,105
还有更多的坏消息
That's more bad news.

631
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:18,506
它跟你从建筑工地带回来的
It's a perfect match to the sample

632
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:19,806
样本完全一致
you brought back from the construction site.

633
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:21,841
毫无疑问了
I mean, there's no doubt about it.

634
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,845
我不想相信这一切
I don't want to believe that.

635
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:27,447
为什么这些老兵们
Why would the vets come back here

636
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:30,951
这么多年后回来 要再卷入
after all these years just to get sucked back into

637
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:33,353
当初赶走他们的事件 只会更糟
what drove 'em out in the first place, only worse?

638
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:36,222
过去的恩怨不易了结
Well, old grudges die hard.

639
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:38,891
没人比你更支持
Nobody's done more to support veterans

640
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:40,626
退役军人了 Dwayne
than you have, Dwayne.

641
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:41,961
可你救不了他们全部
You just can't save 'em all.

642
00:27:41,963 --> 00:27:43,762
我知道
I know.

643
00:27:43,764 --> 00:27:47,766
如果是真的 这太令人失望了
Still, it's disappointing, if it's true.

644
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:51,670
一条臭鱼腥了一锅汤
Something like this stains the whole veteran community.

645
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,471
你打算怎么办
What are you gonna do?

646
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:57,508
就剩一条路了 逮捕Hogan队长
What I have to do-- arrest Captain Hogan.

647
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,523
ATF的档案显示Percy在两年前的一起枪支运输案件中
ATF says Percy was UC on a gun-running pipeline

648
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,724
当卧底
about two years back.

649
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,493
这位骑手 他只是修摩托车的
Easy Rider, he just fixed bikes.

650
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,996
偶尔也参与运输 但只是个小角色
He did the occasional run, but he was a small fish.

651
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:21,865
Percy跟他演了场戏 从而打入团伙内部
Percy played the player so she could get in.

652
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,634
就这些么 她的案件陈述里没有其他关于Ramon的内容了
That's it? Nothing else in her case file on Ramon?

653
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,337
没了 事实上 她几乎没怎么提起过他
No. In fact, she barely mentioned him at all.

654
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,405
你们在FBI那边找到他的资料了么
Did you guys find anything on him at the FBI?

655
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,773
只是些零碎的资料
Just some petty stuff.

656
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,075
我的直觉还是不变
Still doesn't change my gut on the guy.

657
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,476
他跟那些坏蛋混在一起
Hangs out with too many bad guys

658
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,311
但Percy却不认为他同流合污
without being dirtier than Percy thinks he is.

659
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,545
爱情真让人盲目
Love is blind.

660
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:38,481
是啊 又聋又哑
Yeah, deaf and dumb, too.

661
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,816
Pride 我开免提了
Pride, you're on speaker.

662
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:42,018
Sonja还好吧
Is Sonja okay?

663
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,886
Percy吗 好着呢 怎么了
Percy? Yeah, why? What's wrong?

664
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,853
Hogan失踪了
Hogan's missing.

665
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:46,554
我们刚刚去抓他
We just went to bring him in,

666
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:47,589
却在工地后边的沟里
found his bike in a ditch

667
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,024
发现了他的摩托车
behind the construction site,

668
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:50,425
车上还有新鲜的血迹
fresh blood on the tank,

669
00:28:50,427 --> 00:28:51,659
还有离开的轮胎印
tire tracks leading away.

670
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:52,861
Sebastian在跟进
Put Sebastian on it.

671
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:54,296
你认为是骑行帮绑架了他
You think the Niners kidnapped him?

672
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,830
我想不到其它可能了
I don't know what else to think.

673
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:58,233
我们已经发出了Hogan的协查通报 现在我们正
We got a BOLO out on Hogan now, and we're headed over

674
00:28:58,235 --> 00:28:59,234
开往退役军人俱乐部
to the vets' clubhouse to see

675
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:00,435
看他们知道或看见些什么
if they know or saw anything.

676
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:02,703
事态严重了
I don't like where this is heading.

677
00:29:02,705 --> 00:29:03,937
如果骑行帮捉了Hogan
If the Niners took Hogan,

678
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:05,672
事情很快会恶化
things could get ugly real quick.

679
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:07,208
我们不能让Sonja被困在其中
We can't let Sonja get caught up in the middle of it.

680
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,877
我来解决 我们得通知Percy
I'm on it. We gotta get word to Percy.

681
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:12,579
骑行帮刚刚来了
The Niners gang just came up

682
00:29:12,581 --> 00:29:15,016
找Roman问话呢
to Ramon asking for something.

683
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:16,984
看上去有事要发生 我去弄明白是什么事儿
Looks like something's going down-- I'll find out what.

684
00:29:16,986 --> 00:29:19,219
啊 亲爱的 下一轮我请
Hey, baby, next round's on me.

685
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:21,554
呃 有点突发状况
Uh, look, something's come up.

686
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:22,688
我走不开
I gotta jam.

687
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,790
你走不开 什么意思啊
You gotta jam? What do you mean?

688
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:26,592
那些人究竟是谁啊
Who are those guys, anyway?

689
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:29,762
你不想招惹的人 相信我
Nobody you want to piss off, trust me.

690
00:29:29,764 --> 00:29:31,398
我们晚点再联系
Look, we'll have to catch up later.

691
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,533
你就这么丢下我吗
Are you just gonna ditch me...

692
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:35,501
过了这么久才遇见啊
after all this time?

693
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:37,302
我还以为
And here I was thinking

694
00:29:37,304 --> 00:29:40,139
你想知道我离开的原因呢
you wanted to know why I left.

695
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,412
她在干什么
What is she doing?

696
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:48,780
你要是现在走了 就永远都不会知道了
Walk away now, you'll never know.

697
00:29:52,552 --> 00:29:56,154
好吧 你可以来 但是 你还带着吗
All right, you can come, but, uh, you still carrying?

698
00:29:58,058 --> 00:29:59,768
靴子里的刀 你还带着吗
The knife in the boot, you still got it?

699
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:00,322
当然了 怎么了
Yeah, why?

700
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:02,161
千万别把刀扔了 Percy 不要
Don't give up your knife, Percy. Don't do it.

701
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:03,827
骑行帮要是搜我们的身发现了武器
Niners pat us down and they find something bad,

702
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:05,596
我们就完蛋了
we ain't going nowhere good.

703
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:07,532
当然了
Of course.

704
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:17,740
相信我 我知道自己在做什么
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

705
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:19,242
不行 我们得把她弄出来
Forget that, we gotta get her out of there.

706
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:21,844
没信号了
The wire's dead.

707
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:24,847
我现在出去
I'm out.

708
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:40,696
你好
Excuse me.

709
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,913
老兵那边有消息吗
Did you get anything from the vets?

710
00:31:01,915 --> 00:31:03,181
除了他们很生气外 没有了
Other than they're pissed off, no.

711
00:31:03,183 --> 00:31:04,397
但你怎么会跟丢Percy
Now, how could you lose Percy?

712
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:05,457
你应该做她的后援
You're supposed to be her backup.

713
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,524
你在说什么 我们没想到
What are you talking about? We didn't know

714
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:08,259
她会丢掉通信设备
she was gonna dump the wire.

715
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:09,893
如果她要继续跟着Ramon 就必须这么做
She had to if she was gonna stick with Ramon.

716
00:31:09,895 --> 00:31:11,093
她本可以不跟着他 让他走
She could have let him go without her,

717
00:31:11,095 --> 00:31:13,095
但她是老手 她有办法
but she's a pro, she found a way.

718
00:31:13,097 --> 00:31:14,230
是 但她以为你会保护她
Yeah, but she expected you

719
00:31:14,232 --> 00:31:15,565
像你承诺的一样
to have her back, like you promised.

720
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:16,599
-好了 -够了 听我说
- All right, - that's enough. Listen...

721
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:18,067
好吗
All right?

722
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:19,369
这样无济于事
This isn't getting us anywhere.

723
00:31:19,371 --> 00:31:20,903
不管怎样 Percy已处于那种境地
For better or worse, Percy's put herself

724
00:31:20,905 --> 00:31:23,806
她等着我们去找她
in position-- she's counting on us to find her.

725
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:25,308
定位她的一次性手机了吗
GPS her burner phone?

726
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,876
事实上 一次性手机不容易追踪
Burner phones, by nature, don't track easy,

727
00:31:26,878 --> 00:31:28,943
-但我在想办法 -好吧 尽快
- but I'm working on it. - Well, work faster.

728
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:30,479
如果骑行帮和Hogan一起出现
If the Niners show up with Hogan,

729
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:31,746
我不想让她一个人
I don't want her ducking bullets

730
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:33,215
躲避枪林弹雨去救他
trying to save him by herself.

731
00:31:33,217 --> 00:31:35,717
呦 有人在么
Yo, anybody home?

732
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:38,753
请告诉我你有所发现
Please tell me you got something for us.

733
00:31:38,755 --> 00:31:40,255
我会的 这真是个好主意
Oh, I do. It's a brilliant idea.

734
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:42,324
我觉得你们应该把血浆放在院子里
I think you guys should put a plasma in the courtyard.

735
00:31:42,326 --> 00:31:43,425
Sebastian
Sebastian!

736
00:31:43,427 --> 00:31:44,825
好吧 抱歉
Right, okay, sorry.

737
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:48,095
匹配了凶手夹克衫上的DNA后
Um, so I finally got the results on the touch DNA

738
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:49,430
我得到了最终结果
from the shooter's jacket.

739
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:51,065
我把它和骑行帮的DNA进行了匹配
I ran it against the Niners, which was easy,

740
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,600
这很简单 因为他们都有前科
since they all have a police record.

741
00:31:52,602 --> 00:31:54,134
-你有什么发现 -没有
- What'd you find? - Nothing.

742
00:31:54,136 --> 00:31:55,436
不匹配 也就是说
No match, which means

743
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:56,770
杀Fillibert的凶手不是骑行帮的人
Fillibert's killer was not a Niner.

744
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,573
但他穿着骑行帮的夹克衫
But he was wearing a Niner jacket.

745
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:00,474
对 因为他想让它看上去像是
Yeah, because he wanted to make it look like

746
00:32:00,476 --> 00:32:01,608
骑行帮杀了他
the Niners shot him.

747
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,642
好了 另外
Right, well, to that point,

748
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:04,043
我也匹配了简易爆炸装置上的
I also ran DNA recovery

749
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:06,346
DNA采样
on the IED explosives, uh,

750
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:08,248
但也不匹配老兵中的任何一人
but no match on any of the vets, either.

751
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,383
也检查了海军和国防部记录
Checked both navy and DoD records, too.

752
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:12,719
所以 你是说这一切
So, what, you're saying that neither the Niners

753
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:14,954
既不是骑行帮也不是老兵们干的
or the vets are responsible for all this?

754
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:17,390
你知道 我只是个科学家
Well, you know, I'm just a scientist

755
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:18,790
一天到晚在实验室
cooped up in a lab all day,

756
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,226
但如果就证据来讲
but if we go by the evidence,

757
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:21,594
是这样 但是
then yeah. However,

758
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:23,362
证据同样显示
the evidence also shows

759
00:32:23,364 --> 00:32:25,531
凶手夹克衫上和简易炸弹上的DNA
that the DNA from the killer's jacket

760
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:28,166
是匹配的
and the bomber's IED are a match.

761
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:29,702
-这意味着 -有第三方
- Which means? - A third party's

762
00:32:29,704 --> 00:32:31,136
想让双方对立起来
trying to set 'em both up--

763
00:32:31,138 --> 00:32:32,671
想点燃仇恨
trying to rekindle the feud.

764
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:33,639
但最终为了什么
But to what end?

765
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:34,873
他们互相残杀后
I mean, who stands to gain

766
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:35,873
谁能从中获利呢
from them killing each other?

767
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,008
这就是我们要查明的
What we have to find out.

768
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,149
你听说过这个人吗
You hear this guy?

769
00:32:45,151 --> 00:32:47,051
有点嘚瑟 哈
Just the right amount of cocky, huh?

770
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:49,387
-20英尺 -我知道
- 20 high. - I gotcha.

771
00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:51,522
该死
Damn it.

772
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:54,258
我买了啤酒
I brought beer.

773
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,092
来得正好
Yeah, about time.

774
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:01,632
那边发生什么事了
What's going on over there, anyway?

775
00:33:01,634 --> 00:33:04,134
我不知道 我怎么会知道 我只组装摩托
I don't know. How would I know? I just build bikes, right?

776
00:33:04,136 --> 00:33:05,869
是 只不过我没见你组装什么
Yeah, except I don't see you building any.

777
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:07,404
走吧
Come on.

778
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:08,772
不 等一下
No, hold up.

779
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:10,839
你把我带到这个鬼地方
You brought me all the way out here to paradise pit,

780
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:12,941
我想我应该知道这里要发生什么
I think I deserve to know what's going on.

781
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:15,511
我只是不想让我们陷入任何麻烦
I just don't want us to get in any kind of trouble.

782
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:16,779
我们不会 你是我的幸运符
We can't, you're my lucky charm.

783
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:18,614
只要你在旁边 我就不会陷入任何麻烦
I don't get in any trouble when you're around.

784
00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:23,118
来吧 我们单独待会
Come on, let's go catch up in private.

785
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:26,488
我想我有所发现
Think I might have something.

786
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,889
回头打给你
I'll call you back.

787
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,225
区域划分图
Zoning maps?

788
00:33:31,227 --> 00:33:33,127
我一直在想到底是谁
I've been trying to figure out who else

789
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:35,229
想让骑行帮和老兵们相互争斗
would want the Niners and the vets fighting again,

790
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:37,098
但我没有任何思路
but I keep coming up empty.

791
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,267
然后我开始思考 有人或许
Then I started wondering if maybe it was more about

792
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:42,270
不想让老兵们重新回到镇上
somebody not wanting the vets back in town at all.

793
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,237
他们不是在那里建适用住房吗
Isn't that where they're trying to build affordable housing?

794
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,507
-在Broadmoor吗 -嗯
- Broadmoor? - Mm-hmm.

795
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:48,074
在老兵们被赶出新奥尔良
After the vets were chased out of New Orleans

796
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:49,510
McKinley拿走了
and McKinley took off

797
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:50,811
联邦应急管理局的资金后
with the FEMA funds,

798
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:53,414
整个社区开始打官司
whole neighborhood went into litigation.

799
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,749
自那以后就一直搁置
Been left for dead ever since.

800
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:58,084
六个月前 市政府重启了那块地
City released it six months ago.

801
00:33:58,086 --> 00:33:59,486
这时候Fillibert拿到了许可
When Fillibert got the permit.

802
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:01,354
市政府支持Fillibert是因为老兵们
City approved Fillibert because of the vets,

803
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,856
但盯着这块地的不止他一个人
but he wasn't the only one with eyes on the land.

804
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:05,891
过去几年 为了经济效益
Developers been wanting to rezone it

805
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:07,427
开发商一直想再分区
for commercial use for years.

806
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:08,761
老兵们打败了他们
Vets beat them to the punch,

807
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:09,995
把它作为住宅用地
kept it residential.

808
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:11,464
所以 这是一次土地争夺么
So, what, it's a land grab?

809
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,465
有人想要
Somebody wanted to

810
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,733
点燃仇恨
rekindle the feud

811
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:15,702
让老兵们再次离开
to get the vets to leave again?

812
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:17,469
如果老兵们离开了 市政府会放宽许可
If the vets leave, city releases the permits.

813
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:19,771
Broadmoor会重建
Yeah and Broadmoor gets rebuilt,

814
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:20,939
但不再作为住宅
but not for housing.

815
00:34:20,941 --> 00:34:22,240
作为商用
For profits.

816
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:24,309
知道这些开发商是谁么
Well, any idea who the developers are?

817
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:26,110
我知道
I think I know.

818
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:28,179
如果没记错
If memory serves,

819
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:30,114
在McKinley逃跑之前
before McKinley ran off,

820
00:34:30,116 --> 00:34:32,651
他曾将Broadmoor减价出售
he put Broadmoor up on fire sale.

821
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,485
如果没记错是什么意思
If memory serves?

822
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:36,053
这不是重点
Not the point.

823
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:39,690
继续
Keep going.

824
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:43,661
我想也是
Yep, I thought so.

825
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:45,696
公司联合诉讼
Company tied up in litigation--

826
00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:46,831
Aufiero团伙
Aufiero Partners.

827
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:48,932
Aufiero黑手党
Aufiero... Mob?

828
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:50,668
本来是在纽约
Out of New York, originally, yeah.

829
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,168
所以你会知道这些吗
Is that how you know about all this?

830
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,071
这不是重点 但Ramon可能知道
Not the point. But Ramon might be.

831
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:57,674
我认为Aufieros和ATF那件案子有关
I think the Aufieros were connected to that ATF case

832
00:34:57,676 --> 00:34:59,876
Percy就是在办那件案子时遇到他的
Percy was working on when she met him.

833
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:02,679
"勒索 武器交易 走私毒品"
"Extortion, arms dealing,

834
00:35:02,681 --> 00:35:04,347
他们都被抓了
drug running." They all got busted,

835
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:05,882
Ramon属于哪一个
but where does Ramon fit in?

836
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:07,950
他没有被抓 Percy很肯定这点
He didn't get busted, Percy made sure of that.

837
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:11,353
说来话长
Long story.

838
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:13,689
他的名字从来没出现过
There's got to be a reason why

839
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:14,923
一定是有理由的
his name never turns up,

840
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:16,558
但他经常被抓
but he always does.

841
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,193
找到了
Got him.

842
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:22,297
Ramon Vargas Tony Aveda Leo Manzini
Ramon Vargas, Tony Aveda, Leo Manzini.

843
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:23,866
用各种名字 专门从事
Specializes in trafficking weapons

844
00:35:23,868 --> 00:35:25,533
贩运武器
under every name.

845
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:27,101
都是为Aufieros做事
And always for the Aufieros.

846
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:29,804
怪不得Percy没有告发他 她不知道
No wonder Percy didn't turn him in, she had no idea.

847
00:35:29,806 --> 00:35:31,272
很可能就是他点燃仇恨
It could be he's the one who's instigating the feud

848
00:35:31,274 --> 00:35:32,707
为了Aufieros
for the Aufieros.

849
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:33,708
也就是
Which means, yet again,

850
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,142
她不知道
she has no idea.

851
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,519
来吧 Hogan
Come on, Hogan.

852
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:46,753
-等等 -怎么了
- Hold on, hold on. - What?

853
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:47,921
-快走 -别担心
- Move. - Don't worry about it,

854
00:35:47,923 --> 00:35:49,389
-走 -和我们没关系
- Move! - It doesn't matter.

855
00:35:49,391 --> 00:35:50,557
你怎么能说和我们没关系呢
What do you mean it doesn't matter?

856
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,191
你看 那个人被打得血肉模糊了
Look, that guy is beaten to a pulp!

857
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,794
我们得做点什么
We got to do something.

858
00:35:53,796 --> 00:35:55,529
什么 等等 你到底在说什么
What? Hold on, what the hell are you talking about?

859
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:56,563
-算了 -等等
- Never mind. - Wait,

860
00:35:56,565 --> 00:35:57,798
你要离开我吗
you trying to take off on me?

861
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,732
-哦 -你要这么做吗
-  Ow. - Is that what's going on?

862
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:00,399
-嘿 放开我 -不
- Hey, let go of me. - No.

863
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:04,169
现在 听着 我救过你一次
Now, look, I saved your ass once.

864
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:05,370
你最好别
You better not

865
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,672
得寸进尺
push your luck now.

866
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:27,433
我总连不上Percy的一次性手机
Ah, I keep losing the signal on Percy's burner.

867
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,501
要么是她周围有太多干扰
Either there's a lot of interference,

868
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:29,902
要么是她的位置太偏了
or it's too remote.

869
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:32,271
至少我们现在走的方向是正确的吧
Are we at least headed in the right direction?

870
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,506
她在运河边上
Well, it's by the canals,

871
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:35,073
这可能是干扰的原因
that might explain the interference.

872
00:36:35,075 --> 00:36:36,707
我也还是联系不到她
I still can't reach her, either.

873
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:38,510
找到了
Got it!

874
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:39,644
Palomino打捞地
Palomino Salvage.

875
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:41,146
她在废品堆积站
She's at the junkyard.

876
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:42,313
很好 如果你联系上她
All right, if you get her,

877
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:43,614
告诉她我们在路上
you tell her we're on our way!

878
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:47,785
我在你后面 King
<i>Right behind you, King.</i>

879
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:56,527
我们来解决这件事吧 Hogan
Now we're gonna settle this, Hogan.

880
00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:57,528
这还没完
This won't be the end of it.

881
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,495
你说对了
You're right,

882
00:36:58,497 --> 00:37:00,697
没完
it won't!

883
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:01,765
利索点
Get it done!

884
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:04,000
把Hogan队长塞行李箱里去 快点
Put Captain Hogan in the trunk, come on.

885
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:05,702
把他带过来 快点
Bring him over here, come on.

886
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:05,702
{\a6}无服务

887
00:37:08,474 --> 00:37:10,673
好 现在把他带上来
All right, now get him up there.

888
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:13,109
把他带到台子上
Get him on the platform.

889
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:21,184
这个可以
It'll do.

890
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:22,985
放下枪
Drop it.

891
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:27,189
转过身来
Turn around.

892
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:29,391
慢慢地
Slowly.

893
00:37:30,627 --> 00:37:33,027
至少现在我知道你上次为什么离开了
At least now I know why you left last time.

894
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:35,763
你是警察 对吧
You're a cop, aren't you?

895
00:37:35,765 --> 00:37:36,831
对吧
Aren't you?

896
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,600
-Ramon 听着 你不... -快走
- Ramon, look, you don't... - Move!

897
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:40,102
老兵们觉得他们可以不尊敬咱们
Vets think they can disrespect us?

898
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:43,770
那么 骑行帮 我们动手吧
Well, then, Niners, let's do this.

899
00:37:46,775 --> 00:37:48,242
你真觉得你跑的了吗
You really thought you can get away with it?

900
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:49,477
我不知道
I don't know what

901
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,345
-你在说什么 -不可能
- you're talking about! - The hell you don't!

902
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:52,879
启动它
Fire this thing up,

903
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:55,015
让我们彻底了结这个恩怨
we're gonna end this feud once and for all.

904
00:38:05,793 --> 00:38:08,394
联邦探员 放下武器 立刻
Federal agents! Put the weapons down, now!

905
00:38:08,396 --> 00:38:10,029
-别这么做 -跪在地上 Hogan
- Don't do it! - On your knees, Hogan.

906
00:38:10,031 --> 00:38:11,197
我们带你走
Let's go!

907
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:15,535
Percy在哪
Where's Percy?

908
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:16,702
我去找她
I'll go find her.

909
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:20,305
别冲动 Hogan
Easy, Hogan.

910
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:24,576
你不想这样做
You don't want to do this.

911
00:38:24,578 --> 00:38:26,945
这个人杀了Fillibert
This man killed Fillibert,

912
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:29,248
然后试图杀我
then tried to kill me.

913
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,417
这次我不会逃避了
I'm not running from it this time!

914
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:35,085
这不是你
It's not who you are.

915
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:37,188
这不是你当初入伍的原因
It's not why you wore the uniform.

916
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,589
让我们来处理
Let us handle it!

917
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:40,291
就像你们上次处理的那样吗
Like it was handled last time?

918
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:41,659
骑行帮没杀你的人
Niners didn't kill your man

919
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:43,794
老兵们也没炸他们的店
any more than the vets blew up their shop.

920
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:46,797
有人要陷害你们 你们双方
Somebody's trying to set you up, both of you.

921
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,098
你扣动扳机
You pull that trigger,

922
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,401
一切就都完了
none of it's gonna matter.

923
00:38:53,472 --> 00:38:55,405
因为我们会阻止你
'Cause we won't let you do it.

924
00:38:57,276 --> 00:38:59,576
后退
Stand down.

925
00:38:59,578 --> 00:39:00,910
请吧
Please.

926
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:19,662
Ramon 别这么做
Ramon, don't.

927
00:39:19,664 --> 00:39:20,663
放弃吧
Just give it up.

928
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:21,763
去你的 Sunny
Screw you, Sunny,

929
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:23,799
不管你到底叫什么
or whatever the hell your name is.

930
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:28,102
你为什么救我
Why'd you save me?

931
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:29,937
上次你为什么放我走
Huh? Why'd you let me go last time?

932
00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:31,939
因为我很愚蠢
Because I was stupid.

933
00:39:31,941 --> 00:39:33,541
我以为你是无辜的 但是
Yeah, I thought you were innocent, but

934
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:34,942
我这次不会犯同样的错误了
I won't make that mistake again.

935
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:36,578
恐怕你这次没得选
You don't really got a choice this time.

936
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,945
我没有吗
Don't I?

937
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:41,849
FBI 把枪放下 不然我就开枪了
FBI. Drop it or I'll shoot.

938
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:44,418
立刻放下枪
Drop it now!

939
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,320
如果我是你我会照做 因为我向你保证
I'd do it if I were you, Ramon, because I promise you

940
00:39:46,322 --> 00:39:47,987
那姑娘不会放过你的
that girl ain't letting you go.

941
00:40:06,474 --> 00:40:08,674
我说过 我会保护你的
I told you I got your back.

942
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,190
大家都去哪了
Where is everybody?

943
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:28,025
Pride的酒吧
Pride's bar.

944
00:40:28,027 --> 00:40:30,194
他邀请了Hogan的摩托帮
He invited Hogan's MC.

945
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:31,963
他很可能最后会雇下所有人
He'll probably end up hiring 'em all,

946
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:33,964
就像他雇了其他老兵一样
like he hires every other vet.

947
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:35,666
-他能负担的起吗 -不能
- Can he afford to do that? - No,

948
00:40:35,668 --> 00:40:36,667
但那就是Pride
but that's Pride.

949
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:38,869
Patton快被逼疯了
It drives Patton crazy,

950
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:42,172
因为他是管账的
'cause he does the books.

951
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:48,011
嘿 这东西怎么会在Lasalle的桌子上
Hey, what's this doing in Lasalle's desk?

952
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:51,180
你得自己去问"城市鼠"
You ought to ask City Mouse.

953
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,582
"乡下鼠"
Country Mouse.

954
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:53,949
是啊
Yeah.

955
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,991
你知道什么
What do you know?

956
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,694
我不想参与这个话题
Just that I'm not gonna get involved.

957
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,030
你还好吗
So, you okay?

958
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:11,099
我是说 Ramon的事
I mean, about... Ramon?

959
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,941
你应该知道我们匹配了他的DNA
You should know we matched his DNA.

960
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,945
也就是说他既是凶手也是放炸弹的人
Makes him both the killer and the bomber.

961
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:25,780
他还在废品堆积站
He was at the junkyard

962
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:28,282
给骑行帮提供不明枪支
supplying the Niners with nontraceable guns, too.

963
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:30,250
是啊
Well,

964
00:41:30,252 --> 00:41:32,320
我真是会挑人 是吧
I sure know how to pick 'em, don't I?

965
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:39,393
现在你知道我为什么一直避开这个话题了
So, now you know why I kept avoiding the subject.

966
00:41:39,395 --> 00:41:42,061
我不敢相信我这么愚蠢
I can't believe how stupid I was.

967
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:44,096
你不是第一个
Yeah, well, you're not the first girl

968
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:45,898
被坏男孩蒙蔽的女孩
to be blinded by the Bad Boy Spell.

969
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,400
没错 但多数女孩不会
Yeah, but most other girls don't

970
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,168
因此差点丢了性命
almost get themselves killed in doing it.

971
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,471
是 有些人有一段令人耻辱的人生
True, some of us just live a life of shame,

972
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:52,905
感到后悔
kick ourselves,

973
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:55,742
然后逃跑 你懂的
run, you know.

974
00:41:55,744 --> 00:41:59,244
我们之间的共同点比你想的要多 Percy
We might have more in common than you think, Percy.

975
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:03,114
我洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

976
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:05,083
McKinley 卡特琳娜飓风
McKinley, Katrina?

977
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:06,552
对对对
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

978
00:42:06,554 --> 00:42:07,820
他就是我爱上的坏男人
That would be the bad boy

979
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:09,254
在我意识到之前
I fell for, before I realized.

980
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:10,489
不是吧
No.

981
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:12,324
-没错 -你是McKinley的妻子
- Yeah. - You're McKinley's wife?

982
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:13,659
曾经是他的妻子
<i>Was</i> his wife.

983
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:16,394
-哇 -离开他之后我就离开了新奥尔良
- Wow. - Left NOLA right after I left him.

984
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:18,195
也许应该再早点离开
Probably should have left sooner.

985
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:19,731
但我猜 就像你也是
Although I'm guessing, like you,

986
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:22,933
我们也许一直知道他们的真面目 我们只是
we both knew who they were all along, we just...

987
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:25,670
不想承认
didn't want to admit it.

988
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:27,872
活到老学到老 对吧
Well, you live and you learn, right?

989
00:42:28,742 --> 00:42:30,541
希望吧
Hopefully.

990
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:34,845
嘿 呃 这个
Hey, uh, this...

991
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,580
我们不是在联络感情吧
wasn't us bonding, right?

992
00:42:36,582 --> 00:42:38,147
哦 当然不是
Oh, God forbid, no.

993
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:39,449
很好
Good.
