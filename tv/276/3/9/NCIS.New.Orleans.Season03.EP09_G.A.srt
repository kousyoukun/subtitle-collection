5
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:24,213
既然我做的好 为什么你还是紧跟在
I'm doing so great, how come you're right up

6
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:25,848
我身后
<i>on my ass?</i>

7

Not for long, you're not.

有点不对劲
Something's wrong.

11
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:53,309
我刹不住车

我无法控制这辆车
I can't control it!

Jared
Jared!

35
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:01,544
换句话说 别惹她生气
I.E., don't piss her off.

36
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:04,180
我们昨天一起从华盛顿飞过来

38
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:07,550
帮助解决Javier Garcia调查中出现的问题吗
Helping out with the Javier Garcia investigation?

39
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:09,085
希望能建立一个针对他的个案
Hoping to build a case against him,

40
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,253
我可以因此请求陪审团起诉他
so I can petition the grand jury for an indictment.

41
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:13,422
擒贼先擒王 要把垄断联盟
Cut the snake off at the head and get the cartel

42
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,990
彻底赶出NOLA
out of NOLA once and for all.

43
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:16,158
在这他们不说NOLA
They don't call it NOLA down here.

44
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,393
他们更喜欢New Orleans
They prefer New Orleans.

45
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:19,295
哦 Gregorio 很高兴我们给你留下了深刻印象
Oh, glad to see we made an impression on you, Gregorio.

46
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:21,630
哦 那是当然
Oh, absolutely.

47
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:23,132
你带着礼物来的吗
You come bearing gifts?

48
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:24,867
呃 事实上 Garcia送的
Uh, actually, Garcia does.

49
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:27,369
波本威士忌 当作是
Bourbon, as a thank you,

50
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,638
帮助我们拯救了他儿子的学校的谢礼
for helping us save his son's school last week.

51
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,440
东西很贵
This is expensive stuff.

52
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,675
我想说这更像是贿赂
I'd say that's more of a bribe.

53
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:33,976
是啊 为什么我把它送过来
Yeah, why I brought it over.

54
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:36,112
我想你们会把它当作证物记录
Thought you'd want to log it as evidence.

55
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,313
Sebastian怎么样了
How's Sebastian?

56
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:39,949
我敢说 成为团队中的一员 他很兴奋 对吧
I bet he's so excited to be a part of the team, huh?

57
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,518
暂时还不是 还要通过联邦执法培训中心的测试
Not part of it yet, still has to make it through FLETC training,

58
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,454
这意味着 在他通过测试前 我们还是人手不足
which means, until he does, we're short-handed again.

59
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,639
很抱歉让你处于困境
I'm sorry to leave you high and dry.

60
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:47,290
没事
Yeah.

61
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,559
但是如果你需要任何帮助 就通知我 好吗
But look, if you need any help, just let me know, all right?

62
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,091
好的
Okay.

63
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:52,361
很可惜我不认为你能去
Except that I don't think that you can.

64
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:54,463
Isler主任跟我说得很清楚
Director Isler made it pretty clear to me

65
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,098
我们只是来这里建立
that we are only down here to build

66
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,299
针对Garcia的个案
the case against Garcia,

67
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,136
然后就安心回华盛顿
and then it's back to D.C. for good.

68
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,572
好吧 我明白了 这是个重要的案子
Well… I get that. It's an important case.

69
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:05,708
我得走了 Lee女士 很高兴见到你
I gotta go. Nice to meet you, Ms. Lee.

70
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:08,677
嘿 替我向他们每个人问好 行吗
Hey, tell everyone I said hi, okay?

71
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,079
好的 肯定
Yeah, you bet.

72
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,782
再见
Bye.

73
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:15,417
我们继续工作
Let's get back to work.

74
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:27,263
被害人是Jared Connors下士 28岁
The victim is Corporal Jared Connors, 28,

75
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:28,664
第四陆战师
Fourth Marine Division.

76
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,699
休假的时候 他会定期到这里赛车
Drove here regularly when he was on leave,

77
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,835
他甚至在参加过几次业余赛车比赛
he even raced in the amateur circuit a few times.

78
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,570
-老司机了 -很显然是
- Experienced driver. - Apparently.

79
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:36,605
他和他的女朋友 Dana Wells
Him and the girlfriend, Dana Wells,

80
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:40,109
是车祸发生时在赛道上仅有的车手
were the only drivers on the track when he crashed.

81
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:42,178
他的车失去了控制吗
Lost control of his car?

82
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,182
是的 除了他的父亲认为他是被谋杀的
Yeah, except his father thinks he was murdered.

83
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,118
Russ Connors是某个赛车团队里的机修工
Russ Connors is a mechanic on one of the racing teams.

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,420
他告诉当地警官 他确信车被蓄意破坏
Told the sheriffs he's convinced the car was sabotaged.

85
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:54,089
蓄意破坏 他为什么这么想
Sabotage? Why does he think that?

86
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:55,724
我还没跟他说上话
Well, I didn't get to talk to him.

87
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:58,627
他为了把儿子从残骸中拖出来 受伤严重 所以
He got cut pretty bad taking his son out of the wreck, so…

88
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,997
医务人员把他跟他儿子的女朋友都送往医院了
Paramedics took him and the girlfriend to the hospital.

89
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:08,504
你觉得那跟案子有关吗
Think that's case-related?

90
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:11,073
更像是情侣吵架
More like trouble in paradise.

91
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:14,476
我觉得目前他跟Melody处得并不好
I don't think he and Melody are getting along right now.

92
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:16,078
好吧 这很不容易
Well, it can't be easy…

93
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,814
这个女人突然闯进他的生活 还捎带个孩子 吓了他一跳
Woman pops into his life, surprises him with a baby.

94
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:20,716
至少Lasalle正努力去做正确的事情
At least Lasalle's trying to do the right thing.

95
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,785
我只希望不要太影响他的工作
Just wish it didn't affect his work so much,

96
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:24,486
特别是在人员不足的情况下
undermanned as it is.

97
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:26,155
Christopher
Christopher!

98
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,098
死因看起来是
Cause of death appears to be

99
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,968
头部 颈部 胸部的钝力外伤
blunt force trauma to the head, neck, chest.

100
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,770
符合时速100英里以上造成的冲击
It's consistent with an impact of over 100 miles an hour.

101
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:43,305
哦 看来他一直没有减速
Oh, it's like he never slowed down.

102
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:45,407
唯一好消息是
And the only silver lining is

103
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,842
死亡很可能就在一瞬间
the death is likely instantaneous.

104
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:48,143
他没怎么受罪
He didn't suffer.

105
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:50,012
有可能是他的身体状况造成的吗
Possible he had a medical condition?

106
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:52,281
心脏病发作 中风
Heart attack? Stroke?

107
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:56,252
他很年轻 但是尸检后我会有进一步了解
He's awfully young. But I'll know more after the autopsy,

108
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,420
我会做一个兴奋剂检验来检测药物和酒精
and I'll do a tox screen for drugs and alcohol.

109
00:04:58,422 --> 00:04:59,655
你好 老大
Hey, boss.

110
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:00,789
哦 等一下 没人叫你“老大”
Oh, wait, nobody calls you "boss,"

111
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,224
对吧 这太随意了
do they? It's too informal.

112
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:04,893
我懂了 一段崭新的关系不该就这样开始
I get it, it's no way to start a relationship.

113
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,862
Sabastian 我们不用开始什么关系 好吗
Sebastian, we're not starting a relationship, okay?

114
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:08,230
我们都认识好多年了
We've known each other for years.

115
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:10,199
是的 但不是雇主和雇员的关系
Yeah, but not as employer and employee.

116
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:11,700
那是截然不同的互动 长官
That's a whole different dynamic, sir.

117
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,602
“长官”听起来好像也不对
"Sir" doesn't sound right, either.

118
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,204
你确定要让这家伙成为探员吗
You sure about making this guy an agent?

119
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,706
我认为这很伤人 你知道吗 现在
I find that hurtful, you know, right here.

120
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,208
Sebastian 案子
The case, Sebastian.

121
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,143
对 好的 呃
Right. Yeah, well, uh,

122
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:23,646
这很简单 我认为 至少从表面上看
it's really simple, I guess, at least on the surface.

123
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:26,248
车开得太快 没有办法转弯
Car was going too fast, couldn't make the turn.

124
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,349
这种情况不需要复杂的鉴证
Don't really need fancy forensics

125
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:28,317
就能搞明白
to figure that part out.

126
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,952
有被破坏的迹象吗
Any signs of sabotage?

127
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,854
还没有 我会把车送到证据库
Not yet. But I'll have the car transported

128
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:33,989
我要做一个完整的司法鉴定
to the evidence garage, I'll do a full forensic work-up.

129
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:36,358
当然 除非你们需要我待在这儿
Unless, of course, you need me to stay here.

130
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,260
询问目击者 彻底检查这片区域
Interview witnesses, canvass the area.

131
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:39,762
因为我一直忙于跟上
'Cause I am totally up to speed on

132
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,864
NCIS调查手册的进度
the NCIS investigation manual.

133
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,266
我需要你来完成检测
And I need you to finish the examination.

134
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:47,169
暂时 你还是要为我工作的 记得吗
You still work for me, for now, remember?

135
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,704
我马上照办 老大
You got it, boss.

136
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:53,042
Loretta 我们不会让你人手不够的
We're not gonna leave you undermanned, Loretta.

137
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:55,344
Sebastian走出实验室后仍然是为你工作的
Sebastian can still work out of the lab for you,

138
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:58,580
甚至在他成为一名特别检验探员后也一样
even after he becomes a special forensics agent.

139
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:02,017
只希望有人能提前告诉我
Just wish somebody had told me in advance.

140
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:04,953
哦 King 抱歉
Ooh, sorry about that, King.

141
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:06,355
不会再发生了
Won't happen again.

142
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:07,990
以后再说
Talk about it later.

143
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,591
你对竞速车有研究
You got experience tracking cars.

144
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:10,793
你看到了什么
What do you see?

145
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,028
没什么很有用的
Well, not a lot that makes sense,

146
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,563
尤其是这些打滑的痕迹
especially with these skid marks.

147
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:17,132
赛车手知道在转弯处控制车辆滑动
Racers know to control their slides around turns,

148
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:20,069
但是这些表明Jared出于某种原因
but these indicate that Jared kept accelerating

149
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:21,804
不断加速 然后失去了控制
for some reason, and then lost it.

150
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,138
也许他的油门卡住了吧
Well, maybe his accelerator stuck.

151
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,540
有可能
It's possible,

152
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:28,210
但是这些打滑痕迹不是刹车造成的
but these skid marks are inconsistent with braking,

153
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:30,512
这就引出了一个问题 他为什么不刹车
which begs the question, why didn't he?

154
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:33,682
希望Sebastian能给我们解答
Well, hopefully Sebastian will be able to give us some answers.

155
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,251
同时 让我们查明关于
Meanwhile, let's find out everything we can

156
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:37,720
这个海军的一切
about our marine.

157
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:40,155
确保他没有什么见不得人的秘密
Make sure he doesn't have any skeletons in his closet.

158
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:41,857
-可以指望你吗 -当然
- Count on you? - Absolutely.

159
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,992
好的 Percy和我去医院
All right, Percy and I are gonna head over to the hospital,

160
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:46,195
跟Jared的父亲谈谈
talk to Jared's father.

161
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,665
看看能否跟我们解释下 他认为儿子是被谋杀的原因
See if he can explain to us why he thinks his son was murdered.

162
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,934
我不知道为什么我会说车被蓄意破坏
<i>I-I-I don't know why I</i> <i>said it was sabotage.</i>

163
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:53,402
我当时头脑混乱
<i>I wasn't thinking straight.</i>

164
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:54,903
我只是很难过 仅此而已
I was just upset, that's all.

165
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:56,739
但是 Connors先生 你一开始就认为是人为破坏
But, Mr. Connors, there has to be a reason

166
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:58,707
总得有个理由吧
you thought initially that it was sabo…

167
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,211
我说了我脑子很乱 行了吗
I said I wasn't thinking. Okay?

168
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,912
我的儿子刚去世
My son just died.

169
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:05,948
Connors先生
Mr. Connors,

170
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,351
我无法想象这对你而言有多痛苦
I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you,

171
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:13,222
可我们的工作是查出当时你儿子到底经历了什么
but our job is to find out what happened to your son.

172
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,256
你能理解的 对么
You know that, right?

173
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:16,291
是的 当然了
Sure. Of course.

174
00:07:16,293 --> 00:07:18,160
那你知不知道为什么
Do you know of any reason why

175
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,796
有人可能害死Jared
somebody might have wanted to hurt Jared?

176
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:22,931
我 我不知道
I-I don't know.

177
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,135
那你呢 Wells女士
What about you, Ms. Wells?

178
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:27,970
你当时发现什么可疑的情况了吗
Did you see anything suspicious?

179
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:30,773
没有
No.

180
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:32,808
我们当时正在跑道上相互追逐
We were just chasing each other around the track,

181
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,243
你懂的 玩得很疯
you know, messing around.

182
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,978
Jared当时正在教我怎样赛车
Jared was showing me how to race.

183
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,713
这么说这是你第一次赛车
So it was your first time.

184
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:40,449
我以前参加过赛车比赛
I've been in racecars before.

185
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:43,018
我是Warbury赛车比赛的高级协调员
I'm the advance coordinator for Warbury Racing.

186
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,188
这周我们来到镇上是为了参加比赛
We're in town this week for the race.

187
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,023
你们俩都为同一支队伍效力吗
You two work for the same team?

188
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,391
对 差不多有一年了 没错
Yeah, about a year now, yeah.

189
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:51,360
我是这样认识Jared的
That's how I met Jared.

190
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:52,861
自那以后我们就开始约会
We've been dating ever since.

191
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:54,763
-他开车技术如何 -车技非常棒
- Was he a good driver? - He was great.

192
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,331
他一生都在赛车
Well, he's been racing his whole life.

193
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,367
从驾驶单座赛车开始
All the way back to go-carts.

194
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,836
他原本计划退伍后立刻成为职业赛车手
He was gonna turn pro after his discharge.

195
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:03,205
是不是机械故障导致的事故
Possible it was mechanical failure?

196
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:06,408
不 不可能 那辆赛车是我们自己组装的
No, no, no, we built that car ourselves.

197
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,777
每次驾驶前我们都会从头到尾仔细检查
Check it out head to toe every time we took it out.

198
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,013
那么我不得不问
Then I have to ask,

199
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:14,650
Jared有没有为一些事感到沮丧 情绪低落
was Jared upset about anything? Depressed?

200
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:17,486
没有 他不是故意翻车的 如果你在暗示这个的话
No, he didn't crash on purpose, if that's what you're implying.

201
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,787
好吧 那么
Okay, so…

202
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,223
抱歉 如果不是故意为之
Sorry. If it wasn't intentional,

203
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:23,926
也不是驾驶失误或机械故障
and it wasn't driver or mechanical error,

204
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:25,294
那翻车的原因是什么呢
what caused the crash?

205
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,562
我不知道
I don't know!

206
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:37,973
他们显然在隐瞒什么
Well, they're obviously hiding something.

207
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,008
问题是 隐瞒了什么 为什么要隐瞒
The question is, what and why?

208
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,144
根据他们共同维护Jared的表现来看
Either they're complicit, which based on how they were

209
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,546
要么是他们串通好了 这很难令人相信 要么是
both defending Jared, it's hard to believe, or…

210
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:46,482
因为某种原因 他们非常害怕 不敢说出来
They're too scared to talk for some reason.

211
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,984
没错 这就意味着不管现在能否得到他们的帮助
Yeah. Which means we're gonna have to figure out the truth,

212
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,552
我们都要查出真相
with or without their help for now.

213
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:52,154
Loretta得到了尸检结果
Loretta's got autopsy results.

214
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,556
我过去看看她有什么发现
I'll see what she's found.

215
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:56,058
也许你应该和Christopher会合
Maybe you should catch up with Christopher,

216
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,760
搜查Jared的家 看看能否找到线索
go through Jared's house, see if you can find any leads.

217
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:00,329
我认为我们暂时
I don't suppose we could ask Gregorio

218
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,231
还不能让Gregorio帮忙 因为
to pitch in temporarily, seeing as though

219
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,265
我们的线索非常少
we're spread pretty thin.

220
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:04,800
不 我不会指望这个
No, I wouldn't count on it.

221
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:07,603
Gregorio正在帮助联邦律师
Gregorio's helping the U.S. attorney

222
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:10,405
准备针对Garcia的公诉书
build an indictment against Garcia.

223
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:12,674
她用不了多久就该回去了
It won't be long before she's heading home.

224
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,877
最好随她去吧 打起精神 我们还有很多东西要查
Best let her be. Come on. We've got things to learn.

225
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,048
毒性分析仪没有检测出任何有毒物质
A prelim tox screen was negative for any anomalies,

226
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,051
除非你能拿出其他证据
so unless you come up with something else,

227
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:26,555
否则我只能断定他是意外死亡
I'm ruling his death as accidental.

228
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:31,460
你让我大老远过来 就是为了跟我说这个
You brought me all the way out here just to tell me that?

229
00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:34,429
不是 因为我觉得这不是意外
No. Because I don't think it was an accident,

230
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:37,366
主要是因为这个
mainly because of this.

231
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,269
很显然 这位海军是曾被人捅伤的
Apparently, your marine was stabbed,

232
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:42,404
根据肉芽组织
and based on the granulation tissue

233
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:43,672
和恢复的情况来看
and the degree of healing,

234
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:45,807
我认为发生在三四天前
I'd say this happened three or four days ago.

235
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:48,176
他自己缝合的伤口么
He stitch himself up?

236
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:49,311
看起来是
Appears so.

237
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:51,880
他本该去医院的
Should've gone to the hospital.

238
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,749
伤口很深 可他没去
It's a pretty deep wound, but he didn't go.

239
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,417
说明他不希望外界发现
That means he didn't want the authorities

240
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,818
是谁捅伤的他
to find out who stabbed him.

241
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,587
如果这次袭击在某种程度上和
And if this attack is somehow connected

242
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:00,455
翻车死亡有关联 那么
to the crash that killed him, then…

243
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:01,990
正如我所说
Like I said,

244
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:03,859
这不是意外事故
it's not an accident.

245
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:06,962
所有人都隐瞒某件事
Everybody's hiding something about this case.

246
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:08,797
很显然 Jared也是
Apparently, even Jared.

247
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,433
哪儿都一样
That seems to be going around.

248
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:15,337
Loretta 我很抱歉
Loretta… I'm sorry.

249
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:17,739
我并没有和你隐瞒什么
But I wasn't hiding anything from you.

250
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:20,842
我当时以为Sebastian在找我之前会先来找你
I assumed that Sebastian came to you before he came to me.

251
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:25,447
事实是 我先向Gregorio发出职位邀请
Truth is, I'd offered the position to Gregorio first.

252
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:26,648
但她拒绝你了么
And she turned you down?

253
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,617
不太适合她吧 我猜
Wasn't the right fit for her, I guess.

254
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:29,685
所以当Sebastian说他想当探员时
So when Sebastian surprised me,

255
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:30,986
我感到很吃惊 我…
said he wanted to become an agent, I…

256
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:33,822
Dwayne 我没有生你的或Sebastian的气
Dwayne, I'm not mad at you or Sebastian.

257
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:36,992
我一直都知道 他迟早要离开这儿
I always knew he'd come out of his shell sooner or later.

258
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:38,160
事实是
The truth is,

259
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:40,295
我觉得 如果我是你的话 需要更加担心的是
I think you need to worry more about

260
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:43,599
Sebastian在出外勤时会让你发疯
Sebastian driving you crazy in the field, if I were you.

261
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,168
很有可能是这样
Good possibility of that.

262
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,403
好了 去吧 你还有很多事要做
Come on, go. You got your hands full.

263
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:50,205
你也不用担心我
You don't have to worry about me, too.

264
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:53,408
对你我一直都有时间 Loretta
I always got time for that, Loretta.

265
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,117
这有超过10万美金现金了 对吧
There must be over $100,000 in here, huh?

266
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,385
对于一个年薪刚到3万美元的下士来说
That's a lot of cash for a corporal

267
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:06,054
是笔巨款了
that barely clears 30 thou a year.

268
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:07,956
-你认为这钱不干净 -应该是的 对吧
- You think it's dirty? - It's gotta be, right?

269
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,825
我是说 要不Jared怎么会
I mean, why else would Jared hide

270
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:11,393
把这么多现金藏到车库呢
this much cash in his garage?

271
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:13,161
还有 这钱他从哪得来的
Plus, where'd he get it?

272
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,830
可能是他抢银行得来的
Maybe he stole it from a bank.

273
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:17,432
这看上去像是染料包爆炸了
This looks like a dye pack went off.

274
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:20,602
嗯 显然我们这位海军并不像他表面上看起来这么清白
Hmm, apparently our marine isn't as squeaky-clean as he seems.

275
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:22,237
好吧 查出真相的唯一方法就是
Well, only way to find out is

276
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,939
找出钱是从哪里来的
to figure out where the cash came from.

277
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:27,109
FBI专查银行抢劫案
FBI specializes in bank robberies.

278
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:30,178
我过会儿把序列号发给Gregorio
Maybe I'll send Gregorio the serial numbers,

279
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,514
-看看她能否查到来源 -Gregorio
- see if she can trace 'em. - Gregorio?

280
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:34,149
我们不是应该不再让她参与了吗
Aren't we supposed to leave her alone?

281
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,718
简单查查而已 就一分钟的事
It's just a quick check. It won't take her a minute.

282
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,787
-好吧 呵呵 -呵呵
- Yeah, uh-huh. - Uh-huh.

283
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:41,923
Lasalle 你认识他们吗
Lasalle, you know these people?

284
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,892
Melody 你来这里干什么
Melody, what are you doing here?

285
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:46,928
很抱歉 Chris 我跟他说了别来 但是…
I'm sorry, Chris, I told him not to come, but…

286
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,563
你是谁
Who are you?

287
00:11:48,565 --> 00:11:49,865
嘿
Hey!

288
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:52,567
孩子的父亲 就是我
The baby's father! That's who I am!

289
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:54,770
离我儿子远点儿
Stay the hell away from my son!

290
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,097
-手背到后面 快点 -混蛋
- Bend your arms now! - Son of a bitch!

291
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,565
Melody 跟我说
Melody, talk to me.

292
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,435
他说的是真的吗 Tucker不是我儿子
Is he telling the truth? Is Tucker not my son?

293
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,470
你要相信我 我从没想过要伤害你
You gotta believe me, I never meant to hurt you.

294
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,005
这话是什么意思
What is that supposed to mean?

295
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,440
你为什么要对我说谎
Why did you lie to me?

296
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,109
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

297
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,610
Melody
Melody!

298
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,947
听着 在警察来之前先把他关到审讯室
Look, put him in interrogation until NOPD comes.

299
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,716
-放他走吧 -什么
- Let him go. - Do what?

300
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,152
听着 我刚说了放他走 见鬼
Look, I said just let him go, damn it.

301
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,521
如果我是他 我很可能也会这样做
I probably would have done the same thing if I were him.

302
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,890
-Lasalle… -听着 放了他
- Lasalle… - Look, just do it!

303
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,603
离我的孩子远点
Stay the hell away from my kid.

304
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,806
在我改变主意以前离开这里
Get out of here before I change my mind.

305
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,147
你相信他
You believe him?

306
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,749
我不知道该相信什么
I don't know what to believe.

307
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,052
但Melody对此似乎清楚
Melody did seem pretty clear about it, though.

308
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:11,722
我是说 她一直不停地说她很抱歉
I mean, she kept saying she was sorry.

309
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,624
她怎么能这样做呢 King
I mean, how could she do it, King?

310
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,526
把一个小男孩带到我的生活里告诉我
Bring a little boy into my life

311
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,829
我是他的父亲 但其实不是
and tell me I'm his father… when I'm not?

312
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,031
我不知道 Chris
I don't know, Chris.

313
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,733
有些事情你得问她
Something you gotta ask her.

314
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,970
这也改变不了什么 这么做又有什么意义
Well, it won't change anything, so what's the point?

315
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,672
意义是 你有权利知道
The point is, you deserve to know.

316
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,642
无所谓了 行了 事实就是这样
It doesn't matter, all right, it is what it is.

317
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,944
Christopher
Christopher.

318
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,313
这件事不是你假装没发生就可以算了的
It's not something you can pretend didn't happen.

319
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,482
你放走那个揍你的人已经够糟糕的了
It's bad enough you let the guy go.

320
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,484
没什么大不了的
It wasn't a big deal.

321
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,020
袭击联邦警察一直是很恶劣的行为
Assaulting a federal officer is always a big deal,

322
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,488
这你知道
and you know it.

323
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,524
但实际上你并没有逮捕他
The fact that you didn't arrest him

324
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,925
我觉得你头脑不清醒
tells me you're not thinking straight.

325
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,226
听着 不要担心我 King
Look, don't worry about me, King.

326
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,461
好吗 我没事
All right? I'm fine.

327
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,896
我们回去工作吧
Let's just get back to work.

328
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,664
打断一下 关于被偷的钱
Sorry to interrupt, but we just got a lead

329
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,999
有了新线索
on the stolen money.

330
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,367
好 我去查
Yeah, I'm on it.

331
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,676
我什么也没见 线索在哪儿
I don't see anything. Where's the lead?

332
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,512
确切的说不是我的线索
Well, it's actually not my lead, so…

333
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,647
你去了好久 Percy
Took you long enough, Percy.

334
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,115
我也不是整天都有时间
I don't exactly have all day.

335
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,783
哎 抱歉 有事情耽误了
Yeah, sorry, something came up.

336
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,618
-你通知了Gregorio -发了个邮件
- You called Gregorio. - E-mailed.

337
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,520
只是一些序列号
And it was just some serial numbers,

338
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,389
这都是她自己的选择
so this was all her choice.

339
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,891
不是什么大事 Pride 怎么说 事实上也算是吧
It's not a big deal, Pride. Well, actually it is.

340
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,493
这些钱来自一起银行劫案
The bills came from a bank robbery

341
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,361
密西西比的Biloxi 六周前
in Biloxi, Mississippi, six weeks ago.

342
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,330
在劫犯们把钱抢走之前
A teller slipped a dye pack into the money

343
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,865
一个出纳把染色包顺进了现金里
before the robbers took off.

344
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,968
看上去我们的海军成了银行劫匪
Seems that makes our marine a bank robber.

345
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,271
但这不能解释Jared为何被捅伤
Doesn't explain why Jared was stabbed

346
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,306
以及是谁会谋杀他
or who'd want to kill him.

347
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,041
Biloxi案子有多少劫犯
How many robbers in Biloxi?

348
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,542
目击者说有四人
Witnesses said there were four,

349
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,811
包括一个逃走的全副武装的司机
including a getaway driver, heavily armed, too.

350
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,213
所以 劫犯们开始内讧了
So, robbers turning against each other?

351
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,849
-怎么了 -噢 嘿 Hannah
- What's going on? - Oh, hey, Hannah.

352
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,184
Pride探员
Agent Pride.

353
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,852
我希望你们在讨论与贩毒集团有关的案件
This is about the cartel case, I hope?

354
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,854
我得走了 再会
Gotta go. Bye.

355
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,856
哇哦
Whoa.

356
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,491
希望我们没给她找麻烦
I hope we didn't get her in trouble.

357
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,795
-呃 不是“我们” 只有你 -就是个邮件而已
- Uh, not "we," you. - It was just an e-mail.

358
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,663
再怎么说 这给我们提供了一个线索 不是吗
Anyway, it got us a lead, didn't it?

359
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,865
是啊 没准还让Gregorio被解雇了
Yeah, and possibly Gregorio fired.

360
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,668
我知道我们都怎么看待Gregorio的
I know how we all feel about Gregorio,

361
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,972
但是我们得习惯没有她一起工作的日子了 好吗
but we gotta learn to work without her again, okay?

362
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,640
好吧
Okay.

363
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,142
从查明
Starting with figuring out

364
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:16,547
Jared是如何牵扯进银行抢劫案开始
how, exactly, Jared's connected to the bank robbery.

365
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,283
也许就是他父亲和女友在隐瞒的事情
Well, it may be what his father and girlfriend were hiding.

366
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,719
我是说 Dana看起来非常紧张
I mean, Dana seemed really nervous.

367
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,587
我们再去找他们谈谈
Let's have another chat with them.

368
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,689
只不过这次要分开谈
Only separately this time.

369
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:29,093
Sebastian好像在车上找到了些什么
Looks like Sebastian's found something on the car.

370
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,295
我去看看
I'll check it out.

371
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,636
他还好吧
Is he okay?

372
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:39,970
不知道
Don't know.

373
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,111
帮个小忙 可以不
Little help, please?

374
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,014
呃 谢谢
Ah, thank you.

375
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,449
天啊 腰酸背痛
Man, I am sore.

376
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,717
这就是我一直在为海军罪案调查处的训练
It's gotta be all that ab work I've been doing

377
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,719
做的准备 你知道吧
prepping for NCIS training, you know?

378
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,888
哇噢 你介意把那玩意儿关掉吗
Whoa. You care to turn that off, please?

379
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,057
什么 噢 好吧 抱歉
What? Oh, right. Sorry.

380
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,759
这位美人怎么了
So what about this beauty?

381
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,327
嗯 我对这辆车的残骸
Uh, I went over what's left of the car

382
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,762
进行了彻底的检查
with a fine-tooth comb.

383
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,030
我没有找到任何证据
I didn't find any evidence

384
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,098
证明是机械故障或者蓄意破坏
of a mechanical problem or even sabotage.

385
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,667
-但是 -但是
- But? - But…

386
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,168
当我运行了一个全套诊断程序
when I ran a full diagnostic

387
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,270
在这辆车的控制器局域网络
on the car's controller area network--

388
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,805
那个网络就像是 大脑中枢
that's, like, the brain.

389
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,707
这些天几乎控制了这辆车的所有行动
Pretty much controls everything in the car these days.

390
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,542
控制器局域网络 我知道 是个电脑吧
The CAN, I know. It's a computer?

391
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,977
对 就像所有电脑一样
Right, and just like any computer,

392
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,111
可以用新的软件进行升级
it can be upgraded with new software

393
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,579
但是也会被黑掉
but it can also be hacked--

394
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,581
用来完成黑客的所有要求
made to do whatever the hacker wants it to do.

395
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,483
比如用油门替换刹车
Like accelerate instead of brake?

396
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,918
是啊 对这个案子来说 是这样
Yeah, in this case, exactly.

397
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,287
有人用无线操控
Somebody overrode the accelerator module

398
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,555
改动了加速模块
wirelessly.

399
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,323
让它持续加速
Told it to keep going faster.

400
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,225
如果在合适的时机完成改动 司机完全无能为力
If done at the right time, there's nothing a driver can do.

401
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,927
合适的时机就是
And the right time is just as

402
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,395
Jared进入弯道的时候
Jared entered the turn,

403
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,164
这意味着他确实是被谋杀的
which means he was definitely murdered.

404
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,532
是啊 也意味着不管是谁干的
Yeah, it also means that whoever did this

405
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,300
他们完全清楚自己在做什么
knows exactly what they're doing.

406
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,471
不是吧 她在干什么
No, what is she doing?

407
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,439
嗯 怎么了
Why, what's up?

408
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,808
没事 但是我得走了
Never mind. But I gotta go.

409
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,576
嘿 告诉Pride你查出的结果 行吗
Hey, fill in Pride on what you found out, all right?

410
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,813
噢 好的
Uh… okey-dokey.

411
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,115
那是Scott Hamilton
And that's Scott Hamilton…

412
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,118
我希望我能帮助你 真的
I wish I could help you, I do,

413
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,419
但我确实不知道
but I don't know how.

414
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,887
不 你知道的 Dana
Yes, you do, Dana.

415
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,656
你是Jared的女友 你不可能
There's no way you're Jared's girlfriend

416
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,091
一无所知
and didn't know something.

417
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,159
Dana 你的男友是被谋杀的
Dana, your boyfriend was murdered.

418
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,427
你对此竟无动于衷吗
Doesn't that matter to you?

419
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,762
当然不是 但是我要去
Of course it does, but I'm not gonna…

420
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,964
Dana 我们刚刚发现
Dana! We just found out

421
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,365
我们失去了排位赛资格
we lost our qualifying slot.

422
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,800
我们没有资格 就比不了赛
We don't qualify, we don't race.

423
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,402
相信我 各位 我正在处理 好吗
Believe me, guys, I'm working on it, okay?

424
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,970
赛车委员会以为因为Jared的事情
The racing committee assumed we weren't racing

425
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,438
我们不参赛了
because of what happened to Jared.

426
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,273
如果我们不参赛 就拿不到分
If we don't race, we don't get points.

427
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,975
听着 我知道这对你来说很不容易 但是
Look, I know this is a hard time for you, but…

428
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,544
别担心 我会处理的
Don't worry, I'm on it!

429
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,712
Harrison Cal
Harrison, Cal,

430
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,681
这些是联邦探员
these are federal agents.

431
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:31,982
他们正在调查那起车祸
They're investigating the crash.

432
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,183
调查什么
Investigating what?

433
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,318
我还以为那是个意外
I thought it was an accident.

434
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,487
是啊 我们还不太确定
Yeah, we're not so sure.

435
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,989
去吧 准备好 我会给我们拿到资格
Go, get ready. I'll get us a slot.

436
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,625
抱歉 我得回去干活了 各位
Sorry, I gotta get back to work, guys.

437
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,260
哇哦 不行 除非你告诉我们
Whoa. No, not until you tell us

438
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,763
你和Jared的父亲在隐瞒什么
what you and Jared's father are hiding.

439
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,167
我们知道Jared曾被捅伤 我们知道有超过10万美金
We know Jared was stabbed. We know he had over $100,000

440
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,570
失窃现金在他的车库里 我们还知道你不可能
of stolen money in his garage, and we know there's no way

441
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,638
对这事毫不知情
that you didn't know something about this.

442
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,473
目前情况对Jared来说
And this does not look good

443
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,175
非常不利 Dana
for Jared right now, Dana.

444
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,144
如果你在乎他 你得帮助我们
If you care about him, you'll help us.

445
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,112
我也希望我可以
I wish I could.

446
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,047
如果你是在害怕什么
If you're scared for some reason,

447
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,415
我们会保护你
we can protect you.

448
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,786
但如果我们发现你知情不报
But if we find out you're withholding anything,

449
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,754
我们必须逮捕你
we have to arrest you.

450
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,491
我得走了
I have to go.

451
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,094
拜托
Please.

452
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,771
一定是有什么秘密
That must be one hell of a secret.

453
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,673
是啊
Yeah.

454
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,975
Sebastian发来短信
A text from Sebastian.

455
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:36,647
Christopher要他告诉我们
It says that Christopher wanted him to tell us

456
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,449
Jared确定是被谋杀的
that Jared was definitely murdered.

457
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,785
Chris去哪儿了
So where's Chris?

458
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,721
问得好
Good question.

459
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,358
嘿 Christopher
Hey, Christopher.

460
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,927
你给我发了个信息就走了
So you just send me a text and then leave?

461
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:50,961
我不想再打扰你
I don't want to bother you

462
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,029
已经够麻烦你了
any more than I already have.

463
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,363
打扰我
Bother me?

464
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,465
这就是你对你所作所为的说辞么
Is that what you call what you did?

465
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,837
噢 Chris 我很抱歉
Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry.

466
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,739
我 我不该这样做的
I-I shouldn't have done it.

467
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,907
听着 我不明白
Look, I don't understand.

468
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,075
我把你带过来
I took you in,

469
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,210
我试着做正确的事情
I tried to do the right thing,

470
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,212
相信Tucker是我的孩子
believed Tucker was mine.

471
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,580
你为什么要因此说谎呢
Why did you lie about it?

472
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,815
我想我那时只是绝望了
I guess I was just desperate.

473
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,751
你知道 逃离Darrell
You know, to get away from Darrell,

474
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,954
给Tucker找个善待他的父亲 我
to try and find a good daddy for Tucker, I…

475
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,923
逃离Darrell 什么 他
Get away from Darrell? What, did…

476
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,658
他有没有伤害你
did he try to hurt you or something?

477
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,393
让我们 没有
Let's just… no.

478
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,829
Melody 你得给我说说
Melody, you gotta talk to me.

479
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,631
到底怎么了
What's going on?

480
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,135
Darrell脾气不好 我太害怕了
Darrell has a temper, and I was afraid.

481
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,939
不仅是 不仅对我 对Tucker也一样
Not just… not just for me but for Tucker.

482
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,841
我尝试过申请针对他的限制令
I tried to get a restraining order against him,

483
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,611
但他们说 我得等到暴行真正发生后
but they said I had to wait until something bad happened.

484
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,914
我很害怕 我只是 我不知道该怎么办
And I was afraid, and I just-- I didn't know what to do.

485
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,550
我从来不想伤害你
I never meant to hurt you.

486
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,720
没事
Okay.

487
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,223
没事的 好吗
It's okay. Yeah?

488
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,765
别担心Darrell
Don't worry about Darrell.

489
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,467
他不会伤害你们的
He's not gonna hurt either one of you.

490
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:08,238
首先他的会计说 他通过
First his accountant said that he was laundering drug money

491
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,607
高现金业务来洗钱
through high-cash businesses.

492
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,942
这儿的餐厅都挺大的 对吧
Restaurants are big down here, right?

493
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,911
特别大
Huge.

494
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,379
其实我开始还是有点拒绝的
Kind of resisted them at first.

495
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,381
你知道的 我并不算是个吃货
As you know, I'm not much of a foodie.

496
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,349
是嘛 那你现在是了么
What, now you are?

497
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,251
其实吧 我是
As a matter of fact, I am.

498
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,020
在罗马的时候 对吗
When in Rome, right?

499
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,789
好吧 或许你可以帮我们缩小范围
Well, maybe you can help us narrow down

500
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,025
挑选几个主要候选餐厅
which restaurants are prime candidates.

501
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,627
好吧
Okay.

502
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,230
看看都有哪些餐厅
What do we got?

503
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,200
这个怎么样 Pat O'Brien's
How about this… Pat O'Brien's?

504
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,902
Pat O's 他们不是贩毒集团的人
Pat O's? No way they're cartel.

505
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,437
他们在法国区已经有数十年了
They've been in the Quarter for decades.

506
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,640
他们调制的飓风鸡尾酒爽翻了 会让你
Make a killer hurricane cocktail that'll…

507
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,942
你应该试一下
You should try one.

508
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,178
我来这儿不是为了鸡尾酒的 T
I'm not here for the cocktails, T.

509
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,947
好吧
Okay.

510
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:53,750
我们赶紧查清Garcia的案子然后回家吧
Let's just get Garcia and get back home.

511
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,056
我不确定我是否想回家
I'm not sure I want to go back home.

512
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,292
什么
Sorry?

513
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,596
我只是说 我不确定
I'm just saying I'm not sure.

514
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,898
十年前 你恨不得用最快的速度
Ten years ago, you couldn't get

515
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,566
逃的越远越好
far enough away from this place fast enough,

516
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,168
现在你却喜欢上这儿了吗
and now you like it?

517
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,236
我不明白 Tammy
I don't understand, Tammy.

518
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,605
这个贩毒集团的案子可是你的关键一案
This cartel case is your big shot.

519
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,441
Isler可以升官 你也会升官 这可是
Isler moves up, you move up. It's…

520
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,776
你一直挂在嘴边的你想拥有的生活
everything you've always said you wanted.

521
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,781
这难道不是我们分手的原因吗
Isn't that why we broke up?

522
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,951
这跟你和我没有关系 Hannah
This isn't about me and you, Hannah.

523
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,320
这仅仅是我的缘故
This is just about me.

524
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,357
但是 你说你不想继续我们之间的关系
Still, when you say you don't want to be

525
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,926
是因为你想要把精力都放在
in a relationship because you want to focus

526
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,594
-你的事业上 -我当时
on your career… And that's the way

527
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,496
就是这么觉得的
I felt at the time.

528
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,733
听着 我很珍惜
Look, I love

529
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,235
我们共同的曾经 你知道的
what we had together, you know that.

530
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,406
但是 你也知道 当我到了华盛顿特区后我想要逃跑
But, you also know I was running when I got to D.C.

531
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,109
我不知道我自己是谁了
I didn't know who I was.

532
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,581
继续调查Garcia吧 如果发现了什么向我汇报
Keep digging into Garcia, let me know if you find anything.

533
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,916
Hannah
Hannah…

534
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,593
哇哦
Whoa.

535
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,496
Pride 给我回电 关于你手上的案子
Pride, call me back. I think I just got

536
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,831
我刚刚有了重大发现
a big break on your case.

537
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:30,418
利用FBI的劫持专案组调查了在密苏里
Had FBI's Robbery Task Force see if there were

538
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,553
发生的其它抢劫案是否会与密西西比抢劫案的作案手法相匹配
any other robberies that matched the MOs of the one

539
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:35,856
发现类似案件两起 一个是奥兰多银行 一个在莫拜尔
in Mississippi: bank in Orlando, one in Mobile,

540
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:39,293
亚特兰大的装甲车 这其中都涉嫌了三个戴面具的持枪者
armored car in Atlanta. All involved three masked gunmen

541
00:22:39,295 --> 00:22:41,395
有着攻击性武器和带他们跑路的司机
with assault weapons and a getaway driver.

542
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:44,098
跟这几天发生的大多数银行抢劫案很像啊
That pretty much matches most bank robberies these days.

543
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,733
对 但是如果我告诉你 他们中的每个人
Right. But what if I told you each one

544
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:48,402
也正好出现在同一所城市的
also happened to take place in the exact same city

545
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:50,004
赛车比赛呢
as a car race?

546
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:52,373
哈
Huh.

547
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,408
假设这帮强盗团伙
Suggesting that the heist crew

548
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,877
和赛车有联系
is connected to the racing circuit.

549
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:59,313
太多巧合让我们很难不这么猜测
Too much of a coincidence for it not to be.

550
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:01,415
我是说 不管是谁黑进了Jared的车
I mean, whoever hacked Jared's car

551
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,684
很显然他对赛车从里到外都很了解
obviously knew racecars inside and out.

552
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:06,387
是的 除了Jared是海军 而不是赛车手这点
Yeah, except Jared's a marine, not part of the circuit,

553
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,022
那为什么要黑进他的车呢
so why hack his car?

554
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:10,491
- 那个 我就不知道了 -只是好奇
- That, I don't know. - Just curious,

555
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:13,461
你是怎么知道Jared的车被人黑过
how'd you even know Jared's car was hacked?

556
00:23:15,064 --> 00:23:17,264
不要看着我
Well, don't look at me.

557
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:19,233
我照你吩咐的没有跟她讲
I left her alone like you said.

558
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:21,802
我还是保留着NCIS电脑权限
I still have my NCIS computer access.

559
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:23,838
我想我会一直关注你的 你知道
Figured I'd keep tabs on you, you know,

560
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,239
以防什么意外出现
in case something popped up.

561
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:27,108
因为她很想念我们
'Cause she misses us.

562
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,077
Gregorio探员 嗨
Agent Gregorio! Hey!

563
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,313
-很高兴见到你 - 我也是 来假装你并不高兴见到我
- Good to see you. - You, too. Let's pretend you didn't.

564
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:33,948
在我因此丢掉工作之前
I have to get back to the Garcia case

565
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,217
我得回去到Garcia案子上了
before I don't have a case to get back to.

566
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:38,119
祝你们好运
Good luck!

567
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:39,520
我以为她很讨厌带馅煎饼的
I thought she hated beignets.

568
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:41,021
她确实不喜欢
She does.

569
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:43,357
所以 我们有四个抢劫案
So, we got four robberies,

570
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,659
都和赛车有联系
all connected to the racing circuit,

571
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:47,395
Jared的车库里发现了被抢的现金
marked money in Jared's garage.

572
00:23:47,397 --> 00:23:49,897
Russ和Dana什么都不肯说
Neither Russ or Dana are talking.

573
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:52,233
很难相信他们不是抢劫银行的人
Hard not to think that they're the bank robbers.

574
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:54,969
是的 只是Dana看上去恐惧多余愧疚
Yeah, except Dana seemed more scared than guilty.

575
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:56,670
检查下Jared的出行记录
Check Jared's leave record.

576
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,054
看看在每次抢劫案中他都在哪
See where he was on each of the robberies.

577
00:23:58,078 --> 00:23:59,574
明白
Copy that.

578
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:01,208
嗨 你可能想查一下
Hey, you might want to check,

579
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,043
看看他们中有没有谁是电脑专家
see if any of 'em are cyber geeks.

580
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:04,612
我对他们是如何操作这场
I dove into the specifics

581
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:06,347
车祸的细节进行了深究
of how they manipulated that car crash.

582
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:08,682
不管是谁做的 他都很厉害
Whoever did it, they are good.

583
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:10,651
我是说很厉害的门萨国际黑客水平
I'm talking Mensa hacker level good.

584
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:12,753
是 但是 Jared并没有参与抢劫
Yeah, but… it wasn't Jared.

585
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,989
根据海军记录
According to the marines,

586
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:18,459
四起案件中 有三起案件发生的时候他在执行临时任务
he was TDY on three of the four robberies.

587
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:21,128
所以他不可能是团伙中的一员
So he couldn't have been a part of the crew.

588
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,763
或许他发现了这一切
Maybe he found out about it

589
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:24,331
想要做正确的事
and tried to do the right thing

590
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,267
却提前被人杀害了
and got killed before he could.

591
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:28,569
还是不能解释为什么他被捅伤
Still doesn't explain why he got stabbed

592
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:30,371
为什么Dana这么恐惧什么都不肯说
or why Dana was too scared to talk.

593
00:24:30,373 --> 00:24:33,107
或许我们现在应该去找他父亲谈谈了
Maybe we ought to take another run at the father now?

594
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:34,675
这次带上搜查令
This time with a warrant.

595
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:36,310
把他带回来问话吧
Let's bring him in.

596
00:24:36,312 --> 00:24:37,778
深挖每一支
Deep-dive every team

597
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,448
参加比赛的队伍 Patton
that competed in those races, Patton.

598
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,516
尤其是Dana的队伍
Especially Dana's.

599
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:45,219
我希望一个黑客可以找到另一个黑客
I'm hoping that a hacker can find a fellow hacker.

600
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:47,221
拜托 哥们 那不就是我的活么
Come on, man. That's what I'm all about.

601
00:24:47,223 --> 00:24:48,956
这就是为什么我干这行
That's why I do what I do.

602
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,524
好吧 去查吧
Well, go do it.

603
00:24:50,526 --> 00:24:52,393
接电话啊 Christopher
Come on, Christopher.

604
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:54,361
你到底在哪儿啊
Where the hell are you?

605
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:14,882
嗨
Hey.

606
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:16,083
你跑这儿来干嘛
What the hell are you doing here?

607
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:17,885
我是来给你一个友好的警告
I come here to give you a friendly warning.

608
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:19,987
离Tucker和他的妈妈远点
Stay away from Tucker and his mom.

609
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:21,989
-你明白了吗 -什么
- You understand? - What?

610
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:23,624
赶紧走吧 好吗
Get out of here, right…

611
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:25,159
但我并不认为你听进去我的话了
But I don't think you heard me.

612
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:28,596
听着 我可能不是Tucker的父亲
Look, I may not be Tucker's dad,

613
00:25:28,598 --> 00:25:30,764
但我决不允许他 或是他妈妈
but I'm not gonna let anything happen to him

614
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:32,533
有任何闪失
or his mom.

615
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:33,968
所以 如果我是你
So, if I were you,

616
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,670
我就会 离他们远远的
I would just… stay away.

617
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:39,240
-不然呢 -相信我
- Or what? - Well, trust me.

618
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:41,175
你不会想知道的
You don't want to find out.

619
00:25:41,177 --> 00:25:44,545
你知道的 那是我的儿子和我的女人
You see, that's my boy and my woman.

620
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:46,914
所以 为什么你他妈的不离远点呢
So, why don't you stay the hell away from them?

621
00:25:48,684 --> 00:25:50,784
哦 你要扭断我的胳膊了
Ow! You're gonna bust my arm.

622
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:53,554
听着 我是不会警告你第二次的 你听到了吗
Look, I'm not warning you again. You hear me?

623
00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:55,089
-你最好离他们远点 - 嗨
- You stay away from them. - Hey!

624
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:56,757
发生什么了
What's going on?

625
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:19,113
你的机工长 Cal Vernon
Your crew chief, Cal Vernon.

626
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:21,048
有三次入室盗窃的前科
Three priors for burglary.

627
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,218
你的技术专家 Nathan St. Clair
Your tech specialist, Nathan St. Clair,

628
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,354
曾经黑入过美国国防部服务器
served time for hacking a DoD server,

629
00:26:27,356 --> 00:26:29,957
还有两个技工
and two mechanics,

630
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:32,293
你和Ansel Dane
you and Ansel Dane,

631
00:26:32,295 --> 00:26:35,162
也都有前科
also have priors.

632
00:26:35,164 --> 00:26:37,031
你们队伍一半的人都有前科
Half your team's got a record.

633
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:39,466
除此之外 我们知道Warbury赛车队
Plus, we know Warbury Racing

634
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:42,469
在四座发生抢劫案的城市里参加了四场比赛
competed in four cities where four robberies took place.

635
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:44,238
嗯 这说明不了什么
Mm… That don't mean nothing.

636
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,073
我说呀
Come on.

637
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:48,142
Connors
Connors.

638
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,346
为什么你一直在保护那些
Why do you keep protecting the people

639
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:54,481
该为你儿子的死负责的人呢
responsible for your son's murder?

640
00:26:54,483 --> 00:26:57,551
什么样的父亲会这么做呢
What kind of father does that?

641
00:26:57,553 --> 00:27:00,621
你 你不明白
Y-You don't understand.

642
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:02,756
你试试看
Try us.

643
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:04,892
是因为和Dana有关吗
Is this about Dana?

644
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:06,427
是因为这个吗
Is that it?

645
00:27:07,597 --> 00:27:10,364
Jared爱她胜过一切
Jared loved her more than anything.

646
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,567
她也爱他
And she loved him, too.

647
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:14,759
他原本都打算向她求婚了
He was gonna propose to her.

648
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:16,095
这跟案子有什么关系么
What's that got to do with anything?

649
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,606
太有关系了
It's got everything to do with it!

650
00:27:18,608 --> 00:27:20,975
Jared可以为Dana做任何事
Jared would do anything for Dana,

651
00:27:20,977 --> 00:27:22,643
她也很清楚这一点
and she knew it, too.

652
00:27:22,645 --> 00:27:24,178
所以她才从
That's why she wanted

653
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,714
原有的生活中解脱 找到新的出路
to straighten out her life, l-look for a way out.

654
00:27:26,716 --> 00:27:28,482
Dana曾是抢劫团伙中的一员
Dana was part of the heist crew.

655
00:27:28,484 --> 00:27:30,751
是 但是 她想金盆洗手
Yeah, but… but she wanted to quit.

656
00:27:30,753 --> 00:27:32,019
为了Jared
For Jared.

657
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:33,320
但是那伙人不同意
Except they wouldn't let her.

658
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:35,255
他们是谁 那伙人还有谁
Who's they? The rest of the team?

659
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:37,091
不 不 不 也不是每个人都受此牵连
No, no, no. Not everyone was involved.

660
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:38,325
我也没跟他们一伙
I wasn't either.

661
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:39,354
我之前一直不知道
I didn't know about the robberies

662
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:41,321
直到Dana在医院跟坦白抢劫这事儿
until Dana told me at the hospital.

663
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:41,860
我发誓
I swear.

664
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:44,054
那Dana在抢劫团伙里是做什么的呢
So, what was Dana's job on the crew?

665
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:47,027
她是负责跑路的司机 但正如我刚才所言
She was the getaway driver, but like I said,

666
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:49,596
她不想再干了 她还威胁他们说
she wanted out, she threatened to come clean

667
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:50,898
如果不让她撤伙就告发他们
if they didn't let her go.

668
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,499
所以 他们就捅伤了Jared
So, what, they stabbed Jared

669
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,201
以示警告
to warn her?

670
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:56,236
他们发现Dana
They found out that Dana

671
00:27:56,238 --> 00:27:59,406
打算把抢劫的事实和盘托出
was gonna tell him the truth about the heists.

672
00:27:59,408 --> 00:28:01,642
她劝Jared别去医院
She convinced Jared not to go to the hospital,

673
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:03,577
否则他会伤得更严重
so he wouldn't get hurt worse.

674
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:05,879
Dana也不能跟Jared实话实说
Dana couldn't tell Jared the truth, either.

675
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:08,949
她只是让他相信她
She just asked him to… to trust her.

676
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:13,854
抢来的钱就放在Jared的车库里
And the money in Jared's garage.

677
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:17,124
那些钱是她的那份
It was her cut.

678
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:20,594
她决定告诉
She decided to tell…

679
00:28:20,596 --> 00:28:22,696
Jared实情
Jared the truth

680
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:24,698
这周末
this weekend and…

681
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,567
那伙人却发现了
somehow they found out.

682
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,235
所以就动手杀了Jared
Which is why they killed Jared.

683
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:31,838
他们 还威胁要把她也杀了
And they… and they threatened to kill her and, um…

684
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,607
还要杀我 如果
and me, too, if…

685
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,343
如果她还继续生事的话
if she tried anything else.

686
00:28:36,345 --> 00:28:38,545
所以我才不敢告诉你实话
That's why I was afraid to tell you the truth.

687
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,219
他们邪恶至极
They're vicious.

688
00:28:48,824 --> 00:28:50,958
如果他说的都是事实 我们得找到Dana
Well, if he's telling the truth, we need to find Dana

689
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,759
保护她 我们现在就动身过去
and protect her. That's where we're headed.

690
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:55,729
Christopher 你到底上哪儿去了
Christopher, where the hell have you been?

691
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:57,631
我找了你好几个小时了
I've been trying to get a hold of you for hours.

692
00:28:57,633 --> 00:29:00,901
我知道 King 对不起 我回去再跟你解释
I know, King, I'm sorry, and I'll explain it when I get in.

693
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:03,570
等下 等下 等下 你在哪 离赛车场近么
Wait, wait, wait. Where are you? Are you anywhere near the track?

694
00:29:03,572 --> 00:29:05,706
Avondale大街 也就5到10分钟的车程吧 怎么了
Avondale, maybe five, ten minutes, why?

695
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,841
好 你现在赶紧去赛车场
Okay. I need you to head over there as fast as possible,

696
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:10,711
对Dana Wells实行保护性监禁 必要的话先逮捕她
take Dana Wells into protective custody. Arrest her

697
00:29:10,713 --> 00:29:12,246
把她从那儿弄出来就行
if you have to, just get her out of there,

698
00:29:12,248 --> 00:29:13,814
别当着她队友的面
and don't do it in front of any of her crew.

699
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:15,249
你到这了我再跟你说详情
I'll fill you in when you get here.

700
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:16,750
没问题
You got it.

701
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,497
Wells女士 Wells女士
Ms. Wells? Ms. Wells?

702
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:40,941
怎么了 Chris
Yeah, Chris.

703
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:42,643
King 我们来晚了
King, I think we're too late.

704
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:45,545
-什么意思 -看上去Dana已经被带走了
- What do you mean? - Looks like Dana's been taken.

705
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,095
赛车场的监控录像视角很宽
Track surveillance camera has a pretty wide angle,

706
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:03,499
就是这几个人把Dana带上了那辆黑色的道奇战马
but those are our guys forcing Dana into that black Charger.

707
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,267
发布这辆车的协查通告
Add the car to the BOLOs.

708
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:07,002
从今早上开始 没有人见过Vernon Dane
Nobody's seen Vernon, Dane,

709
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,904
还有 St. Clair
or St. Clair since this morning.

710
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:11,173
连今天比赛的赛前检查都没出现
Didn't even show up to pre-check for today's race.

711
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:12,775
他们肯定知道我们已经盯上他们了
They must know that we're onto them.

712
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,877
恩 如果是这样的话 Dana可能已经死了
Yeah. And if so, Dana could already be dead.

713
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,278
不一定
Maybe not.

714
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,347
我用我高超的技术
I hit Dana's e-mails and text messages

715
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,684
黑进了Dana的邮件和短信
with some Triple P-grade hacking of my own.

716
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:24,253
她不仅是赛车比赛的资深协调者
Turns out, she's not just the advance coordinator

717
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,723
也是抢劫案的策划者
for the races, she's the advance planner for the robberies.

718
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,091
有道理
Well, it makes sense.

719
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,227
资深协调者会提前一周到达
Advance coordinators go to the next town

720
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,862
比赛所在地的城市
a week ahead of each race.

721
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,964
这就为抢劫提供了充足的准备时间
That's plenty of time to prep for the next heist,

722
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,832
而且也是完美的掩饰
and it's a perfect cover, too.

723
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,734
这条短信表明他们
And that text indicates that they're planning

724
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,103
今天要在我们城里策划一场抢劫案
a hit today, in our town.

725
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,171
你知道在哪么
You know where?

726
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,205
我追踪不到她的
She left the location

727
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:44,507
任何电子通讯信号了
out of the digiverse.

728
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,141
你觉得他们把Dana截走
You think they took Dana to pull off

729
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:47,743
-去完成另一起抢劫案么 -如果是这样的
- one more heist? - If they did,

730
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,245
他们肯定采取了强迫手段
then they did it by force.

731
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,779
也就是说
Means figuring out

732
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:52,548
找到那伙抢劫犯
where the heist is gonna go down

733
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,316
就是我们唯一能救出Dana的机会了
might be our only chance to save her.

734
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:57,453
哦 我们得缩小区域内的潜在目标了
Oh, we'll narrow down possible targets in the area.

735
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,721
不
No.

736
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,523
Percy和Patton可以搞定
Percy and Patton can do that.

737
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,224
让Sebastian追查
Have Sebastian see if he can figure out

738
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:05,661
那些图上蓝点的目的地
what those schematics and blueprints go to.

739
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,898
那我干什么呢
Well, what does that leave me?

740
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,934
我们谈谈吧
Let's talk.

741
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,340
我知道 King 我搞砸了
I know, King, I messed up.

742
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:20,476
你可不仅仅是搞砸了 Christopher
You did more than that, Christopher.

743
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,445
在案件调查过程中失踪
Bad enough you went M.I.A. in the middle of a case…

744
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:25,748
仅此一次 下不为例 明白么
and that can't ever happen again, understand?

745
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,916
下不为例 但是
It won't, but…

746
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,150
新奥尔良警察局打电话过来了
NOPD called,

747
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,085
说Darrell控告
said Darrell filed

748
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:31,654
你袭击他
assault charges against you.

749
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,721
什么
What?

750
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:34,189
他先打我的
He swung at me first.

751
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:35,891
是的 幸运的是警方找到了目击证人
Yeah, well, lucky they found a witness who said

752
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,426
和你的说辞一致 但这些并不能
the same thing, but that doesn't explain

753
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,662
解释你为什么出现在那里
what you were doing there in the first place.

754
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,797
是这样 Melody曾试着申请针对他的
Look, Melody tried to get a restraining order

755
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,098
限制令
on him, all right?

756
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,601
她很担心自己和Tucker的安危
Said she was worried for both her and Tucker.

757
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,836
所以呢 你觉得
So, what, you thought

758
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:49,772
你得自己搞定这事儿
you-you'd handle it yourself,

759
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,806
于是就去恐吓他了
threaten him?

760
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,840
我做了
Well, I did what

761
00:31:51,842 --> 00:31:52,875
我应该做的
needed to be done.

762
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,443
我见过你怎么做的
I've seen you go off-book…

763
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,744
别把我扯进来
Not about me.

764
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:58,180
你变了 Christopher
This isn't you, Christopher.

765
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,915
也许你以前是这样的
Maybe who you used to be,

766
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,251
但这不该是你现在的样子
but this is not who you've become.

767
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,454
情感问题 我懂的
Emotional situation, I get it,

768
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,591
但是你不能这么毛躁地冲过去就要解决问题
but you can't just go running off hotheaded to solve problems,

769
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,658
不能再这样了
not anymore.

770
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,794
我知道
I know.

771
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,366
我知道
I know.

772
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,472
你得想明白你要什么
You got to think about what it is you want.

773
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:27,977
你想以某种方式
You hoping to keep…

774
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,311
把Tucker
Tucker in your life

775
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:32,047
留在你的生命里么
some way?

776
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:33,349
我不知道
I don't know.

777
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,151
我知道我想给他最好的
I know I want what's best for him.

778
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,388
但有件事儿我绝对可以做
But there's one thing I can do

779
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,257
就是保护他不受Darrell的伤害
and that's protect them from Darrell.

780
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,227
那就想办法
Then figure out how to do that.

781
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,365
肯定会有正确的办法来解决 Christopher
There's a right way to handle this, Christopher.

782
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,166
找到它
Find it.

783
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:01,310
这个金融产品经理Simon Delaney呢
What about this financial manager, Simon Delaney?

784
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,585
恩 有什么线索么
Okay. Anything?

785
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,653
有 在这儿
Yeah, here it is.

786
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,887
Simon Delaney
Simon Delaney.

787
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,356
他显然还是
Apparently, he's also an officer

788
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,959
跟Garcia有关的三家公司的工作人员
of three other LLCs connected to Garcia.

789
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:20,529
也就是说这三家公司有可能牵扯到毒品洗钱
Which means three more possible drug-laundering companies.

790
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,131
Garcia的名字在法人文件上吗
Is Garcia's name on the title?

791
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,200
我得找找了 若是如此
I'll have to find out, but if so…

792
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:26,702
我们就有足够的证据提起诉讼了
We might have enough for an indictment.

793
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,103
嗯
Mm-hmm.

794
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:29,238
特别探员Pride打电话
There's a Special Agent Pride

795
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,239
找你
on the phone for you.

796
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,007
Percy刚刚也打电话来了
Percy just called, too.

797
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,342
肯定有什么重要的事儿
Must be important.

798
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,576
对不起
I'm sorry.

799
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:36,378
-我得去看看 -Tammy
I got to find out. Tammy…

800
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,580
不是有意打扰你
<i>Wouldn't have bothered you,</i>

801
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,549
不过我们认为有人有生命危险
<i>but we think somebody's life</i> <i>may be at stake.</i>

802
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,251
希望FBI的资源能够帮助我们
Hoping FBI resources can help.

803
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:43,686
没问题 你需要什么
Of course, what do you need?

804
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,721
你对赛车场案件的判断是对的
Well, you were right about the racing circuit.

805
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,056
我们确定了抢劫团伙的身份
We've IDed the heist crew

806
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,091
我们认为另一场抢劫可能即将发生
and we think another robbery may be imminent.

807
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:50,793
Patton拿到了设计蓝图和电路图
Yeah, Patton got blueprints and schematics,

808
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,928
但我们只能知道这是一条
but the best we can figure out is that it's a road map

809
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,563
指向某一IP地址的公路图
to certain IP addresses.

810
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,065
具体来说 这些地址
Specifically, the ones that relate

811
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,866
与Arsenal Protection公司研发的
to high-tech communication systems

812
00:33:57,868 --> 00:33:59,368
高科技通讯系统有关
made by Arsenal Protection.

813
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,970
显然 他们把这些东西安装在运钞车上
Apparently, they install them in armored trucks

814
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:05,340
才可以让他们全天候监视安全总部
to allow continuous monitoring from security HQ.

815
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,776
问题是 我们不知道
You know, the problem is, we can't figure out

816
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:08,811
哪几家银行和Arsenal公司
which banks contracted

817
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,346
签了这份系统的合同
with Arsenal for the system.

818
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:13,949
希望银行抢劫案特勤组的数据库
Hoped Bank Robbery Task Force database

819
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,584
会有这方面的信息
might have that information.

820
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,853
让我看看
Let me see.

821
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,422
查过所有的本地银行了 没什么问题
Checked all local banks-- no issues

822
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:22,057
而且他们也快到关门下班了
and they're all closed for the day now.

823
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,559
所有的运钞车都回库了
Yeah, and all the armored trucks

824
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,860
正在做清点
are in and accounted for.

825
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,729
你看 我们…已经没有办法了
Look, we're… running out of options.

826
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,997
你们查过美联储的运钞车了吗
Did you check Federal Reserve trucks?

827
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,299
美联储吗
The Reserve?

828
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,000
这些家伙总不会疯狂到
No way these guys are crazy enough

829
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:33,602
抢劫政府的东西吧 对吧
to go after the feds, are they?

830
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,487
开车
Drive.

831
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,190
Patton还在追踪运钞车吗
Patton still tracking the armored truck?

832
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,456
他们还没有黑进去
They haven't hacked into it yet.

833
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,314
车子还在移动
<i>The truck's still moving.</i>

834
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:11,336
半英里开外
Half mile ahead.

835
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,717
支援什么时候到
When is backup arriving?

836
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:15,218
抢劫团伙可能监视着警用通讯频道
Crew could be monitoring police communications.

837
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,721
通知他们太过冒险 尤其是对Dana而言
Too risky to call, especially for Dana.

838
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:20,390
你们转进Magnolia大街 我们前后夹击
<i>Cut over to Magnolia,</i> <i>we'll box them in.</i>

839
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,767
小心点 我想我们被跟踪了
Heads up! I think we're being followed.

840
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,535
快汇报
Call it in.

841
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,773
-你干嘛呢 -不是我
- What're you doing? - Wasn't me.

842
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:38,108
这车就这么停了下来
The truck just shut down.

843
00:35:39,878 --> 00:35:42,278
敢动一下你就死定了
Move and you're dead.

844
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:46,016
开锁 快
Locks! Now!

845
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,352
-下来 -别 别激动
- Come on! - Take it, take it easy.

846
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:51,187
-快走 -好 好的
- Move it! - Okay, okay, all right, all right.

847
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:52,756
快去拿钱
Get the money!

848
00:36:00,465 --> 00:36:01,965
快跑 跑
Go, go, go!

849
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:03,700
NCIS
NCIS!

850
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,736
交给我了 快去追Dana
I got this. Go get Dana.

851
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:28,324
等等 她是不是在给我们发信号
Wait, i-is she signaling us?

852
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:29,659
她想让我们从侧面上
She wants us to cut around.

853
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:30,627
为什么
Why?

854
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:31,928
只有一种方法才能知道
One way to find out.

855
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,530
抓紧了
Hang on.

856
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:41,171
他们干嘛呢
What are they doing?

857
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:52,849
联邦探员
Federal agents!

858
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:54,851
举起手来 从车里出来
Hands up! Get out the car!

859
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:02,025
你还好吗 Dana
You okay, Dana?

860
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:04,928
还行吧 大概
Yeah, I think so.

861
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,062
车技不错
Nice driving.

862
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:08,431
你也是
You, too.

863
00:37:20,712 --> 00:37:23,780
我们无法保证Dana可以逃脱牢狱之灾
Can't guarantee Dana won't spend some time

864
00:37:23,782 --> 00:37:25,882
Connors先生
behind bars, Mr. Connors.

865
00:37:25,884 --> 00:37:30,353
因为 毕竟 她曾经和他们是同谋
I mean, after all, she was complicit until she wasn't.

866
00:37:30,355 --> 00:37:31,921
恩 我知道
Yeah, I know.

867
00:37:31,923 --> 00:37:34,190
但我和联邦检察官说过了
But I spoke to the federal prosecutors,

868
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:39,462
告诉他们 她帮我们抓获抢劫团伙的所有事情
told them everything she did to help us bring down the crew.

869
00:37:39,464 --> 00:37:41,865
加上 她也很配合调查
Plus, she's cooperating,

870
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:44,334
因此我还是很有信心的
so I'm hopeful.

871
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:46,636
至少不管如何
At least one way or the other,

872
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:48,605
她得到了解放…
she's out from underneath it…

873
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:50,373
终于…
finally…

874
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,908
平安无事
and safe.

875
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:54,844
我只求这么多
That's all I wanted.

876
00:37:57,816 --> 00:37:59,949
Jared也会这么想的
That's all Jared would've wanted.

877
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:13,396
保重
Take care.

878
00:38:13,398 --> 00:38:15,598
恩
Yeah.

879
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:20,370
可怜的人呐
Poor dude.

880
00:38:20,372 --> 00:38:22,639
他经历的太多了
He's been through a lot.

881
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:26,176
还会经历更多
Gonna go through a lot more, too.

882
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:29,512
丧子之痛 无以复加
Losing a child, nothing harder.

883
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:31,781
我有点理解他的感受
Sort of know how he feels.

884
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:35,385
但是…
Still…

885
00:38:35,387 --> 00:38:36,986
我们的确做得很好
we did a lot of good…

886
00:38:36,988 --> 00:38:39,689
尤其是在我们人手不足的时候
especially considering we're down a man.

887
00:38:39,691 --> 00:38:40,924
我以你们为荣
I'm proud of you.

888
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:42,358
对 不过我没觉得
Yeah, but I didn't feel

889
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,626
我们少一个人
like we were down a man, though,

890
00:38:43,628 --> 00:38:44,828
因为每个人都参与了进来
the way everybody was pitching in.

891
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,062
还蛮不错的
It was kind of cool.

892
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:47,764
Gregorio也没被解雇
Didn't get Gregorio fired, either.

893
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:49,299
只是就目前情况来看
As far as we know.

894
00:38:50,635 --> 00:38:52,702
一旦Sebastian通过训练
Well, we'll finally get back up to speed

895
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:54,604
我们就能够恢复以前的状态了
once Sebastian gets through training.

896
00:38:54,606 --> 00:38:57,674
同时…
In the meantime…

897
00:38:57,676 --> 00:38:59,676
我们休假一天
let's take the day off.

898
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:01,277
我觉得很好啊
Now, that works for me.

899
00:39:04,182 --> 00:39:05,748
老兄 我都能
Man, I can just

900
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,852
听到靶场在呼唤着我的名字
hear that firing range calling my name.

901
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:10,053
天哪
Geez.

902
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:12,388
你怎么办
What about you?

903
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,524
我想你懂的
I think you know.

904
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,995
嗨
Hey.

905
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:20,830
你认为我们能够提起诉讼吗
Think we have enough for an indictment?

906
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,299
等我回来的时候告诉你 但我不抱乐观态度
I'll let you know when I get back, but I doubt it.

907
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:25,201
我们仍然需要确凿的证据
We are still looking for the smoking gun

908
00:39:25,203 --> 00:39:28,404
将Garcia与NOLA交易直接联系起来
to directly link Garcia to NOLA businesses.

909
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:30,073
新奥尔良
New Orleans.

910
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,844
新奥尔良
New Orleans.

911
00:39:34,846 --> 00:39:36,246
自从你来到这儿之后
You really have changed

912
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,614
你的确变了 对吧
since you've been down here, haven't you?

913
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:38,848
怎么说
How so?

914
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:41,017
你看上去更开心了…
You seem happier…

915
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:42,352
这是件好事
which is a good thing.

916
00:39:43,622 --> 00:39:46,256
可能对我们来说不是好事 但对你 绝对是好事
Not for us, maybe, but for you, definitely.

917
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:51,027
可能
Maybe…

918
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:53,363
你终于可以停下奔波
you finally have stopped running.

919
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:54,964
我也这么想
I think so.

920
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:57,066
但是 工作方面
Still, what are you

921
00:39:57,068 --> 00:39:59,435
你要怎么处理
gonna do for work?

922
00:39:59,437 --> 00:40:01,070
NCIS的位置已经满了
NCIS slot's already filled.

923
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:02,272
我不知道
I don't know.

924
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,474
我之前一直在想 我可以试着说服Isler
I was thinking I'd try talking Isler

925
00:40:04,476 --> 00:40:06,876
把我调到这儿
into transferring me here.

926
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:09,545
祝你好运 Isler需要你
Good luck. Isler needs you.

927
00:40:09,547 --> 00:40:11,881
他可不会轻易把你拱手让人
He's not gonna let you go that easily.

928
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:14,651
要是他不放手 我就倒霉了
Yeah, well, if he doesn't, I'm screwed.

929
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:18,154
好吧…
Well…

930
00:40:23,194 --> 00:40:26,262
…祝你好运
…good luck.

931
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:45,448
警察到这儿来做什么
What-what are the police doing here?

932
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,717
不要紧的 他们来这儿只是为了
Oh, it's no big deal-- they're just here in case

933
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,585
防止Darrell在你离开前就出现
Darrell shows up before you leave.

934
00:40:49,587 --> 00:40:51,888
但他怎么知道我们要走了
But how does he know that we're leaving?

935
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,256
哦 他可能已经听说了
Oh, a little birdie might've told him.

936
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:54,290
什么
What?

937
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:56,893
听着 Melody
Look, Melody…

938
00:40:56,895 --> 00:40:59,595
你不必再去担心他了 我保证
you don't have to worry about him anymore, I promise.

939
00:40:59,597 --> 00:41:01,431
为什么 你要做什么
Why, what are you gonna do?

940
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:02,498
做该做的事
What needs to be done.

941
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:06,970
你呆在这儿
All right, you stay here.

942
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:08,771
你把Tucker放在车里
You put Tucker in the car.

943
00:41:08,773 --> 00:41:10,640
我马上就回来 好吗
I'll be right back, all right?

944
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:16,813
发生什么了 啊
What's going on, huh?

945
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:18,181
他们要逮捕你 Darrell
They're arresting you, Darrell.

946
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:19,115
你们要干嘛
Hey, what're you doing?

947
00:41:19,117 --> 00:41:20,316
放开我
Get off me.

948
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:21,517
我做了背景调查
I did a background search.

949
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,885
德克萨斯州有未执行的关于你的逮捕令
You got outstanding warrants in Texas.

950
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:25,922
加上袭击联邦官员
That, plus assaulting a federal officer,

951
00:41:25,924 --> 00:41:27,557
你估计要在牢里呆很久了
you'll be going away for a long time.

952
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,826
安分点 把手放在身后
Settle down, hands behind your back!

953
00:41:29,828 --> 00:41:30,994
这不对 好吗
This ain't right, okay?

954
00:41:30,996 --> 00:41:31,928
你们不能这么对我
You can't do this to me.

955
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,029
已经做了
Already did.

956
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:34,797
我告诉过你离他们远点
I told you to stay away from them

957
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:35,965
我是认真的
and I meant it.

958
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:37,800
走吧 把他带走
Now, go on, get him out of here.

959
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:45,975
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

960
00:41:45,977 --> 00:41:47,910
没什么好说的
There's nothing to say.

961
00:41:47,912 --> 00:41:50,279
你来向我求助 不是吗
You came to me for help, right?

962
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:52,849
或许事情没有朝着
It may not have turned out the way

963
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:54,450
我们两个人设想的方向发展 但…
either of us wanted it to, but…

964
00:41:54,452 --> 00:41:56,219
事实证明
it's how it turned out

965
