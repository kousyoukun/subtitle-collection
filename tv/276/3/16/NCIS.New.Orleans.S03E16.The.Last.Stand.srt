哦 好像有点紧绷
Oh, seem a little tense.

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,291
你也许需要弹得放松一点
You might want to lighten up on the keys.

你也弹钢琴吗
You play?

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,286
没有 不过我以前偶尔会唱歌
No. I used to sing a little, though.

Why'd you stop?

Besides, 25 years is a long time to hold a grudge.

33

00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:19,484
好
Okay.

152
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:23,355
看看 Noah的哪起案子和他的失踪有关系
See if we can figure out which, if any, of Noah's cases

153
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:25,591
如果有的话
have something to do with his disappearance.

154
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,826
机密案件 我们有权限吗
Classified cases-- do we have access?

155
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:29,561
有 并且Rita会去跟我们会合
Yeah, we do, and Rita will meet us there

156
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,163
帮我们解决问题
to help us sort things out.

157
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:32,464
那好
Okay, then.

158
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:35,701
我很期待和这个Rita会面
Look forward to meeting this <i>Rita.</i>

159
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:41,707
不要误会我
Don't get me wrong.

160
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,509
要说我来这里后 懂得了什么
If there's anything I've learned since I got here,

161
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:45,444
那就是你有特定的司法方式
is you have a definite nose for justice.

162
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,647
就是 用很不平常的方式接案子
It's just, you know, unusual way of taking the case, is all.

163
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,149
你想说什么 Gregorio
What are you trying to get at, Gregorio?

164
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:51,417
没什么 我只是说
No, nothing. I'm just saying,

165
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,685
我们通常是有了案子才开始行动
we usually start things off with an actual crime.

166
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:55,020
接到来电 有尸体
Phone call, a body.

167
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:58,323
但现在 很大程度是依赖于你的这个朋友Rita
But here, banking a lot on this Rita friend of yours.

168
00:06:58,325 --> 00:06:59,925
你一定有很充分的理由来相信她的直觉吧
You must have good reason to trust her instincts.

169
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:00,859
确实是
I do.

170
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:01,760
哦
Oh.

171
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:04,430
继续试探 纽约官
Keep fishing, New York.

172
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,333
谢谢你来 Dwayne
Thanks for doing this, Dwayne.

173
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:10,169
不用谢
No thanks necessary.

很多头衔 我知道
Lot of titles, I know.

178
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:20,112
你可以叫我Rita
You can call me Rita.

179
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:21,580
很高兴见到你 Rita
Nice to meet you, Rita.

180
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:23,782
地方法院同意我们介入么
D.A. get us any access?

181
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:26,752
必须回到现役才能拿到 但是可以
Had to go back on active duty to get it, but yes.

182
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,587
幸亏制服还合身 有一段时间没穿了
Glad the uniform still fits. It's been a while.

183
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:29,922
不 你看起来棒极了
No, you look great.

184
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:31,123
-谢谢 -嗯
- Thank you. - Yeah.

185
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,292
女士们
Ladies? Yeah.

186
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:35,994
我们在Noah的卷宗里有发现任何有帮助的线索么
We find anything in Noah's case files that might help?

187
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:39,398
很可惜 还是毫无线索
No, nothing yet, unfortunately.

188
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,467
我找遍了他手头上的所有待处理案件
I've gone through all his current JAG caseload,

189
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,802
尽管很敏感
but although sensitive,

190
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:45,871
但没有发现什么疑点
nothing stands out as suspicious.

191
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:47,806
他的电脑呢 也被清空了么
What about his computer? Has that been erased, too?

192
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:49,441
没有 电脑看起来保存完好
No, it seems to be intact.

193
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,643
最后一次上机是在
His last entry was calendaring the meet

194
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,779
安排和我明早的行程
he wanted to have with me tomorrow morning.

195
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:55,914
家里的电脑被清空了 办公室的却没有
Home computer wiped, office not?

196
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,516
如果Noah真的失踪了
If Noah's really missing,

197
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,818
更有可能是因为私人原因而非工作原因
could be more of a personal nature than business.

198
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,186
Gregorio说的对
Gregorio's right.

199
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,387
如果这里没有任何线索
If there aren't any leads here,

200
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,323
而他的公寓却有...
but there were at his apartment...

201
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,191
你很了解他
Look, you knew him well.

202
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:07,993
他下班之余都会干些什么
What did he do with his personal time?

203
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:09,695
我几个月前才刚搬回来
We really haven't had a chance to catch up

204
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,563
我们真没什么机会见面
since I moved back here a couple months ago.

205
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:13,132
哦 你在新奥尔良住过么
Oh, you lived in New Orleans?

206
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,633
很久以前了 那还是
Long time ago, way, way back

207
00:08:14,635 --> 00:08:16,468
我第一次遇到Dwayne的时候
when I first met Dwayne.

208
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,538
Noah似乎和Fort MacArthur有很深的关联
Looks like Noah was pretty involved with Fort MacArthur.

209
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,939
Fort MacArthur是什么
What's Fort MacArthur?

210
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:23,242
城外一家私人军事院校
Private military academy outside the city.

211
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:26,111
那座学校在城里有很长的历史了
Town has a long-standing history with the school.

212
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:28,580
接收有犯罪前科的问题少年
Takes in troubled juvies with criminal records.

213
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:30,782
那里是他们回头是岸的最后机会
Place is their last shot at turning their lives around.

214
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:32,417
对Noah来说就是这样
Just like it did for Noah.

215
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,919
学校给他提供了教育和指导
Academy offered him structure and direction.

216
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,354
这就是他参加海军的原因
It's why he joined the Navy.

217
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:37,456
也是他一直在那里做志愿者的原因
And why he's been volunteering there ever since.

218
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,591
他想要报答
He likes to give back.

219
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,293
其实 和你很像
A lot like you, actually.

220
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:45,264
看起来你的朋友
Looks like your friend

221
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:47,533
不只是在做志愿者
was doing more than volunteering.

222
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:49,434
学生档案 记录本
Student files, log books,

223
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:50,903
休假申请
leave requests,

224
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,070
学校土地的工程图纸
blueprints of the school's ground.

225
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,405
我觉得 这更像是
I mean, it almost feels like

226
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,641
他在那里调查某些东西
he was investigating something there.

227
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:58,677
我很好奇是什么
I wonder what.

228
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,480
你有什么线索 Sebastian
What you got, Sebastian?

229
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:02,714
好
Okay.

230
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:03,982
我们这就来 告诉Christopher
We're on our way. Uh, tell Christopher

231
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:05,984
我们去那儿跟他们会合
we'll meet them there.

232
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:08,887
Noah的电脑是被远程清除的
Noah's computer was erased remotely,

233
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:12,824
但是他们可以通过IP地址追踪到他的手提电脑
but they were able to trace the IP address to his laptop.

234
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:14,760
打给我 无论好坏
Call me. Good or bad.

235
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,161
一定
Promise.

236
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,476
Noah Sandler的车
Noah Sandler's vehicle.

237
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:34,446
从车胎印看 它停在这儿一整夜了
Judging by the tire tracks, it sat here overnight.

238
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,448
-有发现Noah么 -暂时没有
- Any sign of Noah? - Not yet.

239
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,650
知道他一直待在这儿干什么吗
Any idea what he was doing all the way out here?

240
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:40,052
可能是猎捕短吻鳄
Well, it could have been gator hunt.

241
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:41,420
有装备
Got the gear.

242
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:43,689
这是一个好地方 但是要够胆量
It's a popular spot, but you got to have courage.

243
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:45,090
什么意思
Meaning?

244
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:47,426
伊利湖并不是捕猎的安全地方
Lake Verret's not the safest place to hunt.

245
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:48,527
非常偏僻 并且危险
It's pretty remote and dangerous.

246
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,896
一般没有人会独自过来
Nobody usually comes out here alone.

247
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:53,932
手提电脑找到了 但是也被清除干净了
Found the laptop, but it's been wiped clean, too.

248
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,500
据Sebastian说
And according to Sebastian,

249
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:58,437
它曾被用来远程清除Noah家里的电脑
it was used to remotely erase Noah's home computer first.

250
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:01,406
Noah并不是大老远过来清除电脑的
Noah didn't come all the way out here to erase computers.

251
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:04,042
King
King.

252
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:21,560
哇哦
Whoa.

253
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:27,933
走开
Hyah. Get back. Hyah.

254
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,901
走开
Hyah. Get back.

255
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:31,737
走开
Get back.

256
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:33,672
去 去
Hyah. Yeah.

257
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,742
走开
Get back.

258
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:38,477
去
Hyah.

259
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:44,082
这应该是Noah
It's probably Noah.

260
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:49,221
看起来 他中了两枪
Looks like he's been shot twice.

261
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:52,958
也就是说 失踪人员案现在变成谋杀案了
Which means our missing persons case just turned into a murder.

262
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:07,924
Wade医生给你打电话了么
Hey, Doc Wade call you yet?

263
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:08,729
没有 怎么
No, why?

264
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,897
她刚刚给Noah律师做了初步尸检
She just finished her prelim autopsy on JAG Noah.

265
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,165
结果证明你是对的
Turns out you were right.

266
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,466
他被人从后面开了两枪
He was shot twice in the back.

267
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:14,967
是捕猎意外么
Hunting accident?

268
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:16,536
我不觉得 创口离得很近
I don't think so. It was a tight pattern,

269
00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:17,737
而且两枪都是直击心脏
and both went right through the heart.

270
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:19,572
致命枪杀
Kill shots.

271
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:21,841
问题是 谁杀了他 为什么杀他
Question is, who killed him and why?

272
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:24,110
看起来 他是自己开车出去的
Looked like he drove out there by himself.

273
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:25,578
有人在守株待兔
Someone lying in wait,

274
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,647
想让这看起来是捕猎时出现的意外
hoping to make it look like a hunting accident?

275
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,482
他们怎么知道他会去那里呢
Yeah, how'd they know he'd even be out there?

276
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:30,650
他又为什么去呢
And why was he there?

277
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:32,218
给你的朋友Rita打电话
Calls your friend Rita,

278
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,587
说他想和她谈一个敏感的案子
says he wants to discuss a sensitive case with her.

279
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:36,289
所以 这肯定跟
Well, it had to be connected to whatever case

280
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,690
他想和她谈的案子有关 是么
he wanted to talk to her about, right?

281
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,358
而且告诉她 这很重要
And told her it was important.

282
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,295
现在的情况是 如果Rita没有来找我
Thing is, if Rita hadn't come to me when she did,

283
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:44,330
我们可能永远都找不到Noah的尸体
probably never would have found Noah's body.

284
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:46,098
鳄鱼会把尸体吃光的
Gators would have made sure of that.

285
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,034
凶手想要的是什么呢
Was probably what the killer was hoping for.

286
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:49,769
你和Patton有没有查出
You and Patton have any luck figuring out

287
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:51,804
Noah的电脑被清除前有什么东西
what was on Noah's computers before they got erased?

288
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:54,373
没有 我们甚至黑进云端去检查数据流
Nada. We even hacked into the cloud to check the data stream.

289
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,641
也就是说 不管这个人是谁
Which means whoever it was

290
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:57,143
都花了很大的功夫
went through an awful lot of trouble

291
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,579
来掩盖Noah正在查的事情
to cover up whatever Noah was working on.

292
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:00,813
有消息吗
Any word?

293
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:08,855
你说你会打电话的
You said you would call.

294
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:10,857
我知道 但我们刚回来
I know. But we just got back,

295
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:14,827
而且我 想先确定一件事
and I... I wanted to be sure first.

296
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:16,762
确定什么
Sure of what?

297
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:18,731
不论结果好坏 你都想知道
Good or bad, you wanted to know.

298
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,533
这不是件好事
It's not good.

299
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:22,535
Noah被杀了 Rita
Noah was murdered, Rita.

300
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:24,303
被枪杀了
He was shot.

301
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:27,206
什么
What?

302
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,574
怎么会 谁干的
How? Who?

303
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:29,809
我不知道
I don't know.

304
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:32,879
我们刚开始调查
We just started the investigation.

305
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:35,548
我猜
I assume that...

306
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,684
你有一直在查
that you've kept looking.

307
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:41,387
知道Noah想要和你说的是什么吗
Any idea what Noah wanted to talk to you about yet?

308
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,022
什么事那么重要
What was so important?

309
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:46,759
我 呃
I, uh...

310
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:50,963
我认为和Terrence Lewis有关
I think it had something to do with Terrence Lewis.

311
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:52,365
他是Noah在学校
He's one of the cadets

312
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,467
指导的军校学员之一
that Noah was mentoring at the academy.

313
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:56,869
我在你离开后
I started looking more

314
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:59,839
开始进一步查找Noah和Fort MacAArthur的联系
into Noah's Fort MacArthur connections after you left.

315
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,807
Lewis有什么特别的吗
What's so special about Lewis?

316
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,676
Noah要求看
Uh, Noah had requested

317
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:06,078
那个男孩的少年犯档案
the boy's juvenile criminal file,

318
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,980
但是没有法庭命令 执法署不能接触
but JAGs can't access a minor's record

319
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:09,315
未成年人档案
without a court order.

320
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:12,919
但是地方检察官可以 你认为
But A.D.A.s can, and you're thinking that, uh,

321
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,788
他打电话给你 是希望你能给他文件
he called you, hoping you could get him the files?

322
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,456
Terrence Lewis是坏孩子
Troubled kid, Terrence Lewis.

323
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,525
袭击 持械抢劫
Assault, armed robbery,

324
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:22,061
他在学校也没有重新做人
and it doesn't look like he got reformed at the academy, either.

325
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:23,462
还是在学校内外
Kept getting into trouble,

326
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:25,298
不断惹麻烦
both in and out of Fort MacArthur.

327
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,068
如果Terrence Lewis知道Noah在调查他
If Terrence Lewis knew Noah was investigating him...

328
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,803
他可能杀了他 是吗
He might have killed him so he couldn't?

329
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:32,738
这是延伸的猜测
That's a stretch.

330
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,340
我只是在寻找真相 Dwayne
I'm just looking at the facts, Dwayne.

331
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:35,808
这是我的工作
It's what I do.

332
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,478
很抱歉 但不是每个孩子都会被改变的
And I'm sorry, but not every kid can be reformed.

333
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,580
Lewis看起来就没有
And Lewis looks like he wasn't.

334
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:44,917
暴力背景 持有武器
Violent background, access to weapons,

335
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,321
接着是 Noah在我们见面前被枪杀
and then Noah gets shot to death before we can even meet?

336
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:51,557
如果那不是可能的原因 我不知道还有什么了
If that's not probable cause, I don't know what is.

337
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:54,694
别急着判断
Don't want to rush to judgment here.

338
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:57,630
特别是关系到学校里的孩子
Especially when it comes to the kids at the academy.

339
00:13:57,632 --> 00:14:00,333
嫌疑人就是嫌疑人 与年龄无关
Suspects are suspects, regardless of age.

340
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:02,401
听着 我知道Noah是你的朋友
Look, I know that Noah was your friend.

341
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:03,703
跟这个没有关系
That's got nothing to do with this.

342
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:05,805
有关系 你无法理智思考
It does when you're not thinking straight

343
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:08,074
因为你很生气
'cause you're loaded for bear.

344
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:16,816
可能是我第一次争赢了你
Might be the first argument I ever won with you.

345
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:21,420
我有很好的团队 Rita
I got a good team here, Rita.

346
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:24,457
他们工作做得很好
They're good at their jobs.

347
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,860
让我们去调查Terrence Lewis
Let us investigate Terrence Lewis

348
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:29,295
不管这事
and whatever connection

349
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:31,864
跟学校有没有关系
the academy may or may not have had in this,

350
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:36,402
我保证 我们会找出杀害Noah的凶手
and I promise we'll find out who killed Noah.

351
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,306
好吧
Okay.

352
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:42,742
但如果你们没找到 我会的
But if you don't, I will.

353
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:18,511
Pride探员吗 我是Walsh上将
Agent Pride? General Walsh.

354
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:21,013
对你早有耳闻 很高兴终于见到你了
Heard a lot about you. It's nice to finally meet you.

355
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:22,181
你也是 将军
You, too, General.

356
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:24,550
特别探员Percy和Lasalle
Special Agents Percy and Lasalle.

357
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:25,684
-欢迎 -你好 将军
- Welcome. - Hey, General.

358
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:26,952
-欢迎 -谢谢
- Welcome. - Thank you.

359
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:28,888
立正
Atten-hut.

360
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,156
所以
<i>So...</i>

361
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,857
NCIS怎么会来Fort MacArthur
what brings NCIS to Fort MacArthur?

362
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:35,027
最好在私下里谈
Well, probably best to discuss in private.

363
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:36,695
孩子们在这儿
Minors around,

364
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,831
我们想尽可能保持低调
want to handle this as sensitively as possible.

365
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,000
明白 感谢你们
Understood... and appreciated.

366
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:44,036
尤其是考虑到大多数学员的来历
Especially considering where most of our cadets come from.

367
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:47,073
警察往往把他们想得很坏
Law tends to assume the worst about them.

368
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:51,043
Sklahr将军 那是谁
Uh, General Sklahr, who is that?

369
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:53,712
他是创建这个地方的人
He was the man who practically founded this place.

370
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:55,047
你认识吗
You're familiar?

371
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:56,882
在这个城市长大的人很难不知道
Hard to grow up in this town and not be.

372
00:15:56,884 --> 00:16:00,352
他做了很多好事 帮助了很多问题少年
All the good he did, troubled kids he helped.

373
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:02,888
给了他们一个家 第二次机会
He gave 'em a home, a second chance.

374
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,223
Sklahr将军对大多数孩子来说
General Sklahr was the father figure

375
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:05,991
是不曾有过的父亲的形象
most of these boys didn't have.

376
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,993
很难接替的角色
That's large shoes to fill.

377
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:10,629
被任命从事这样的工作感到很自豪
Proud to have been appointed to do exactly that.

378
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:13,666
但是 说比做要容易
Although, easier said than done.

379
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:15,734
停
Halt!

380
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,570
♪ The military live... ♪

381
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:23,542
说吧 孩子们惹上什么麻烦了
So, which of my boys is in trouble?

382
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:25,244
暂时还不确定
Well, not sure any are yet.

383
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:26,645
所以我们才来到这儿
That's why we're here.

384
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:29,348
希望得到协助
Hoping for an assist.

385
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,917
我们想和一个学员谈一谈 Terrence Lewis
We'd like to talk with one of your cadets, Terrence Lewis.

386
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,253
我也想
Well, so would I.

387
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,789
Lewis士兵已经擅自缺勤三周了
Private Lewis has been UA for three weeks now.

388
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,525
但我说不上这不正常
Wish I could say that was unusual.

389
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:41,260
Lewis经常失踪吗
Lewis go missing often?

390
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:43,295
很遗憾 是的
Unfortunately, yes.

391
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,766
我们很自豪能在这里改造孩子
We take pride here in reforming boys,

392
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:49,468
教他们遵守规矩
teaching 'em to obey orders,

393
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,838
如何面对比自身强大的东西
how to commit to something larger than themselves.

394
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,707
但是 我们并不总能成功
But, we're not always successful

395
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,242
恐怕Lewis士兵就是这一类
and I'm afraid that includes Private Lewis.

396
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:58,344
你通知警局他失踪了吗
You notify NOPD he was missing?

397
00:16:58,346 --> 00:16:59,411
他们人手不足
They don't have the manpower

398
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:01,714
无法追踪逃跑者 而且...
to chase down runaways and...

399
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:04,483
像Lewis这样的孩子没有优先级
juvies like Lewis aren't a high priority.

400
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,018
他做了什么
What's he done?

401
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,954
重申一遍 我们不确定 但是
Again, not sure, but, uh...

402
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:13,926
很抱歉这么说
I'm sorry to say,

403
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:16,862
Noah Sandler律师被杀害了
JAG Noah Sandler has been murdered.

404
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,167
Terrence Lewis是嫌犯之一
And Terrence Lewis is a person of interest.

405
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,804
Noah 天啊
Noah, my God.

406
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:27,673
怎么回事 什么时候
How, when?

407
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,608
昨晚
Last night.

408
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,546
我们现在知道的是 Noah在调查Lewis
And what we know now is: Noah was investigating Lewis.

409
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:35,414
也许还调查这个学校
And maybe even the academy.

410
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,949
调查
Investigating?

411
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:38,851
Noah从来没和我说过
Noah never said anything to me about it

412
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,953
他一直在这里
and he was here all the time.

413
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:43,856
他教导许多孩子 不只有Lewis士兵
He mentored lots of boys, not just Private Lewis.

414
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:46,258
我们可以和Lewis的指挥官谈一谈吗
Is it all right if we speak with Lewis' commanding officer?

415
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,694
当然
Of course. Uh...

416
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:52,031
Dorsey 请进来
Dorsey, come in here, please.

417
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:56,368
长官
Sir?

418
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,971
这些是NCIS的探员们 Dorsey上校
These are NCIS agents, Captain Dorsey.

419
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:00,673
他们要和Carbral少校谈话 越快越好
They need to speak to Commander Cabral ASAP.

420
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:02,942
好的 长官 这边请
Yes, sir. Right this way.

421
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,812
Pride探员
Agent Pride?

422
00:18:06,814 --> 00:18:10,649
Noah去世的消息会严重打击到孩子们
This news of Noah's death is gonna hit the boys hard.

423
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,352
我希望由我来告诉他们 如果可以的话
I'd rather they hear it from me, if that's all right with you.

424
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:15,221
好的
Yes, sir.

425
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,899
有什么发现 Loretta
What do we got, Loretta?

426
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:29,868
抱歉 这个问法太像Pride了
I'm sorry, that was way too much like Pride.

427
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,804
那太糟糕了 我得改一改
That was awful. God, I got to work on that.

428
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,472
我会改的 会好的
I'll work on it, it's gonna be fine.

429
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:36,742
别用力过猛 Sebastian 你做得不错
Stop trying so hard, Sebastian, you're doing fine.

430
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:38,677
我知道 我知道 我知道 只是
I know, I know, I know, it's just...

431
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,381
我大概还在找自己在NCIS的风格
still trying to find my NCIS way, I guess. You know?

432
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:44,116
也许我应该继续做个闷罐子
Maybe I should keep the moped.

433
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:45,851
你是来问进展的吧
You here for an update?

434
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:47,753
没错 好几颗求知的心想要知道进展
I am. Yeah, inquiring minds want to know.

435
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,255
尤其是Pride
Especially Pride's.

436
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:51,924
显然 一个完整的尸体会有帮助
Well, obviously, an intact body would have helped,

437
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:54,927
但是从可见的割伤和磨损的痕迹
but from the pattern of the cuts and abrasions I've seen,

438
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:57,496
以及没有凝血作用来看
coupled with the lack of coagulation,

439
00:18:57,498 --> 00:19:01,800
Noah律师的尸体是在死后被拖过去的
it appears JAG Noah's body was dragged postmortem.

440
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:03,602
因为嘀嗒嘀嗒的鳄鱼么
Because of Tick-Tock Croc?

441
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:06,939
这是《彼得潘》里面的
It's a <i>Peter Pan</i> reference.

442
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:08,474
不管怎么说
Anyway,

443
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:10,109
短吻鳄的咬痕
the alligator bite pattern didn't match

444
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:13,379
跟割痕的方向并不一致 所以
the indicated direction of the cuts, so...

445
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:15,881
凶手一定是射杀Noah以后 才把他拖走的
So the killer must have dragged Noah after he shot him,

446
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:17,416
拖到离水更近的地方
closer to the water.

447
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:20,552
指望着短吻鳄能吃掉证据
Hoping the alligators would devour the evidence, yes.

448
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:22,488
不过对我们确认凶手身份
Doesn't really get us any closer

449
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,990
没什么很大的帮助
to IDing the killer, though.

450
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:26,625
我们有没有什么办法
Is there any way that we can, uh,

451
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,327
能缩小枪支范围的
narrow down what type of gun was used?

452
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,663
这肯定是某种自动步枪
It was definitely an automatic rifle of some kind.

453
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:32,498
根据
Based on the...

454
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,667
入射伤口来看 可能是军用枪支
entry wound, probably military.

455
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:37,336
在你找到子弹之前 我没法确定
I can't be sure until you find me the projectiles.

456
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:39,138
是啊 这就得看运气了 对吧
Yeah, well, good luck with that, right?

457
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,940
一个威力强大的步枪 子弹穿过人体
A high-powered rifle, bullets went right through the body,

458
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:44,209
可能被埋在小河附近的什么地方
it's probably buried back in the bayou somewhere.

459
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:45,804
嗯 在我听来像是需要一次外勤行动
Mm-hmm. Sounds like a field trip to me.

460
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:47,346
没错
Yeah.

461
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:49,315
等等 你是说我吗
Wait, do you mean me?

462
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:53,085
你想让我回到那个
You-- you want me to go back out there

463
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:55,521
致命的短吻鳄的世界 我一个人
to deadly gator-world? By myself?

464
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:57,956
嘀嗒嘀嗒的鳄鱼
Tick-Tock Croc.

465
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:03,295
好吧
All right.

466
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:04,963
我不会再见到你了
I'll see you never.

467
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:08,067
全体注意 立正
<i>Platoon, atten-hut!</i>

468
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:09,568
下午好 长官
Good afternoon, sir.

469
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,936
稍息 少校
At ease, Commander.

470
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:13,138
Cabral少校 这些是NCIS探员
Commander Cabral, these are NCIS agents.

471
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,973
他们需要跟你单独说几句话
They need to speak with you in private.

472
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,643
好的 长官
Of course, sir.

473
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:19,311
Cole 出列
Cole, front and center.

474
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:23,749
你来指挥 上尉
Your command, Lieutenant.

475
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:25,651
是 长官
Aye, sir.

476
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:30,089
我还是不能理解
Still can't wrap my head around

477
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,291
教少年犯用M16步枪射击
how teaching juvies to shoot M16s

478
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:34,059
跟改造他们有什么关系
helps reform them.

479
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:36,495
这不在于怎么射击 而在于教导他们什么是责任
Well, it's not about that. It teaches them responsibility.

480
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:38,564
至少这里给了他们一个机会
At least this place gives them a chance.

481
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:40,165
举枪
Port arms!

482
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,335
我能怎么协助你们
How can I be of assistance?

483
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,937
我知道Terrence Lewis
I understand Terrence Lewis

484
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,705
曾经在你的小队里 少校
was in your squad, Commander?

485
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:49,241
依然在我的小队里 是的
<i>Is</i> in my squad. Yes, sir.

486
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:50,976
不过 列兵Lewis近来...
Although, currently, Private Lewis is...

487
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:53,145
失踪了 我知道 你跟他熟吗
UA, I know. How well do you know him?

488
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:56,515
Walsh上将三个月前把他分配到我的小队里
General Walsh assigned him to my squad three months ago.

489
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:58,650
希望我能帮他改邪归正
Hoped I could straighten him out.

490
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:01,687
-怎么个情况 -能自由发言吗
- How so? - Permission to speak freely?

491
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:04,256
我们只是想寻找答案
We're just looking for answers.

492
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:05,724
只要有帮助 说什么都行
However you can help.

493
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:09,862
列兵Lewis是新兵中的刺头
Private Lewis was a difficult recruit.

494
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,997
这个学校
The academy prides itself

495
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,868
以忠诚和服从命令为荣
on strength through loyalty, following orders.

496
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,103
Lewis完全反着来
Lewis fought it every step of the way.

497
00:21:18,105 --> 00:21:20,839
所以我可以理解为 你跟Lewis相处得并不好
So I take it you and Lewis didn't get along very well.

498
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:23,542
Lewis跟谁相处得都不好
Lewis didn't get along with anyone very well.

499
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:26,712
-那Noah律师呢 -律师
- What about JAG Noah? - JAG...

500
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:29,615
他是最好的 他一直在我们身边
He's the best, he's always been there for us.

501
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:32,284
他也帮Lewis 但是
Lewis, too, but...

502
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:33,786
但是什么 孩子
But what, son?

503
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,757
就在几周前 Noah律师想帮他
Just a few weeks ago, JAG Noah tried to help Lewis

504
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,726
从一些麻烦中脱身
with some stuff he was going through.

505
00:21:40,728 --> 00:21:43,195
但是Lewis发了飚
But Lewis got mad.

506
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:44,797
变得更暴力
Violent, even.

507
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,232
还狠狠地打了Noah律师
Hit JAG Noah-- hard, too.

508
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:50,736
之后再也没人见过他
That's the last anyone ever saw of him.

509
00:21:56,177 --> 00:21:58,010
那是什
What the...?

510
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:22,134
找到了
Bingo.

511
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:38,484
好的
Okay.

512
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:56,034
哦 天呐
Oh, my God!

513
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,726
根据腐烂程度
Judging by the rate of decomposition,

514
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:13,362
我推测这个男孩大概死于三周前
I'd estimate the boy died about three weeks ago.

515
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:15,364
跟Lewis失踪的时间一致
Same time Lewis went UA.

516
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:16,365
死因呢
Cause of death?

517
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:17,366
你这位失踪的学员
Your missing cadet

518
00:23:17,368 --> 00:23:18,834
明显被打过
was obviously beaten.

519
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:20,736
即使过了这么久 他脸上
Even after all this time, bruises on his face,

520
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:22,505
胳膊上和胸口的伤痕依然明显
arms, and chest are still evident.

521
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:24,840
是啊 但更有意思的是 打他的凶器是什么
Yeah, more interesting, though, is what was used to beat him.

522
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:26,542
我们复原了
Yes, we recovered the same substance

523
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:29,145
表皮淤伤里发现的物质
found in the epidermis of the bruises--

524
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:31,948
碱液 甘油 氢氧化钾
lye, glycerin, potassium hydroxide...

525
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,017
也就是肥皂 我们甚至在他的嘴里发现了大量的肥皂痕迹
I.e., soap. We even found trace amounts of it in Lewis' mouth.

526
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:37,186
-肥皂 -肥皂打人
- Soap? - Soap bashing.

527
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:41,023
是军队一直谴责的一种欺凌方式
A hazing technique the military has long condemned.

528
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:44,026
只不过肥皂不能打断这个男孩的顶骨
Except soap didn't break the boy's parietal bone.

529
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:45,661
死因是后脑上
The cause of death was a sharp blow

530
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:47,430
致命的一击 我还在试着
to the back of the head, and I'm still trying

531
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:49,398
查清具体用的是什么凶器
to figure out exactly what was used.

532
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,100
欺凌过头了吗
Hazing gone too far?

533
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:53,803
如果是这样 Noah律师是把Lewis当成受害者
If so, JAG Noah may have been investigating

534
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:56,505
而不是少年犯来进行调查
Terrence Lewis as a victim, not a juvie.

535
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:58,474
不知怎么查出了弃尸地点
Somehow figured out where the body had been dumped,

536
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:00,476
前往Verre湖边调查
went to Lake Verret to investigate,

537
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:02,445
然后被杀害Lewis的人射杀了
and then got shot by whoever killed Lewis.

538
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:05,948
我真不想这么说 但是如果不止一个学员
Well, I hate to say it, but if more than one cadet

539
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,618
羞辱过Lewis 那很难相信
really did haze Lewis, then it's hard to believe

540
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,653
他们与两起谋杀案没有关联
they're not responsible for both murders.

541
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:12,688
我们不能直接下结论 好吗
We're not gonna jump to conclusions here, okay?

542
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,123
我们需要确认
We need to be sure.

543
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:18,260
好了 Loretta 我需要准确知道
Okay, Loretta, I need to know what <i>exactly</i>

544
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:20,062
杀害Terrence Lewis的凶器
was used to kill Terrence Lewis.

545
00:24:20,064 --> 00:24:21,130
马上去
On it.

546
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:22,198
Sebastian
Sebastian,

547
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,299
查清杀害Noah律师的子弹
get an ID on those bullets

548
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:24,333
都是什么型号
that killed JAG Noah.

549
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,601
我想尽快知道
I want to know what type of weapon

550
00:24:25,603 --> 00:24:26,769
它们来自哪种武器
they came from ASAP.

551
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,571
-收到 -你要去哪
- Copy that. - Where you going?

552
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:29,739
Rita刚发了信息
Rita just texted.

553
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:31,140
我得试着拖延她
I need to try and slow her down.

554
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:33,509
她一到就让她上来
Send her up as soon as she gets here.

555
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:39,515
Max Cabral 用致命武器袭击
Max Cabral, assault with a deadly weapon.

556
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:41,550
William Cole 暴力袭击
William Cole, aggravated assault.

557
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:43,753
-Jamal Povey 强奸未遂 -Rita
- Jamal Povey, attempted rape. - Rita...

558
00:24:43,755 --> 00:24:46,689
Tyler Wilson 持枪抢劫 名单还没完呢
Tyler Wilson, armed robbery. And the list goes on.

559
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:48,991
在听到发生什么之后
I unsealed every cadet's criminal record

560
00:24:48,993 --> 00:24:50,526
我解封了所有学员的犯罪记录
after I heard about what happened.

561
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:52,361
我知道Noah相信这些孩子 Dwayne
I know Noah believed in these boys, Dwayne.

562
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:53,796
我知道你也相信他们
I know you probably do, too.

563
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:55,297
但你不能说
But you can't tell me

564
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,967
他们都没有能力进行谋杀
none of them are capable of murder.

565
00:24:57,969 --> 00:24:59,735
你不能因为他们的过去就对他们有偏见
You can't prejudge them from their past.

566
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:02,138
这不公平 这是改造的意义所在
That's not fair. That's what reform's all about.

567
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,906
这已经和改造无关了
This isn't about reform anymore.

568
00:25:03,908 --> 00:25:05,241
这是关于正义
This is about justice.

569
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:06,976
我同意 但我想说的是
I agree, but all I'm saying is

570
00:25:06,978 --> 00:25:08,611
我们知道的还不够
we don't know enough yet.

571
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:10,646
我们已经有足够的证据去申请
Well, we know enough to get a search and arrest warrant

572
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:12,081
对整个学校的搜索和逮捕令了
for the entire academy,

573
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,116
这正是我要去做的事情
which is exactly what I'm going to do.

574
00:25:14,118 --> 00:25:15,451
但如果你错了呢
And what if you're wrong,

575
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:16,786
就像昨天
like you were yesterday,

576
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:19,255
你以为是Lewis杀了Noah
when you thought that Lewis killed Noah?

577
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:21,490
带着那些搜查令 媒体人员
Bring all those warrants, media follows,

578
00:25:21,492 --> 00:25:23,626
让这件事情变成头条新闻
makes this headline news,

579
00:25:23,628 --> 00:25:25,094
让Fort MacArthur关门大吉
and Fort MacArthur gets shut down.

580
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:27,229
-这是你想要的吗 -不 我想要正义
- Is that what you want? - No! I want justice,

581
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:29,398
你也应该想要正义
and you should want that, too.

582
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,734
-他们只是孩子 -他们是嫌疑犯
- They're boys. - They're suspects!

583
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:38,908
听着 我知道城里的人都爱戴你 Dwayne
Look, I know everybody in this town loves you, Dwayne.

584
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,944
他们一向如此 因为你总把他们放在第一位
They always have because you always put them first.

585
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:43,012
相信我 我知道
Believe me, I know.

586
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:44,113
这跟我们无关 Rita
This isn't about us, Rita.

587
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:46,148
我知道你是怎么长大的
I know how you grew up.

588
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,817
我知道你想要给所有人
I know how you want to give everyone,

589
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,486
尤其是那些弱者 无辜的推测
especially the underdogs, the benefit of the doubt,

590
00:25:50,488 --> 00:25:53,723
但有时候他们不值得
but sometimes they don't deserve it.

591
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:56,225
我们还不知道
We don't know enough yet.

592
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:59,295
这对学校和那些孩子来说都太冒险了
There's too much risk to those boys and to the academy.

593
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:01,297
所以 Rita 拜托
So, Rita, please...

594
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,032
我不同意
I disagree.

595
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:05,000
Noah律师也许在你的执法范围内
JAG Noah may be your jurisdiction,

596
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:06,702
但Terrence Lewis归我管
but Terrence Lewis is mine.

597
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:09,205
我要去申请逮捕许可证
I'm getting the arrest warrants.

598
00:26:17,615 --> 00:26:20,216
我不相信这些
I don't believe this.

599
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:21,917
凌辱 谋杀
Hazing? Murder?

600
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,552
如果这是真的 我已经失去了
If any of this is true, I've lost total control

601
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:25,187
对学校的控制
of this school.

602
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:26,989
你对此有多肯定
How certain are you of this?

603
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:28,491
杀死Noah的子弹可能来自于
The bullets that killed Noah could have come

604
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:30,192
学校的一把步枪
from one of the academy's rifles,

605
00:26:30,194 --> 00:26:31,794
所以我们需要调查真相
so we need to find out what is true

606
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:34,530
看看我们是否能够控制局势
if we have any hopes of containing the situation.

607
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:35,831
因此 我们需要
And to do that, we need to

608
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,067
测试学员的步枪 进行匹配
test your cadets' rifles for matches,

609
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,002
还要知道哪个学生在两起谋杀发生的时候
and know which students were off-campus or on leave

610
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:41,437
不在学校 或者请假了
during both murders.

611
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:45,040
我去调记录
I'll get the logs.

612
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:49,445
安全
Clear!

613
00:26:53,351 --> 00:26:55,918
谢谢大家的合作
Thank you guys for your cooperation.

614
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,386
在查清Noah律师的案子后
Didn't know how you would act

615
00:26:57,388 --> 00:26:59,822
不知道你会作何反应
after finding out what happened to JAG Noah.

616
00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:00,923
他会是第一个站出来安抚我们
He'd be the first to counsel calm

617
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,224
告诉我们服从命令
and tell us to follow orders,

618
00:27:02,226 --> 00:27:03,359
这就是我在做的事情
and that's what I'm doing.

619
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:04,727
好了 下一个是谁的枪
Okay, whose rifle's up next?

620
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:06,595
-Cabral少校的 -拿来吧
- Commander Cabral's. - Let's have it.

621
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:19,375
我还是不明白 他们为什么检查我们的枪
I still don't understand, why are they checking our guns?

622
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:20,676
我不知道
I don't know.

623
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:24,013
Cabral少校 稍息
Commander Cabral. At ease.

624
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:25,481
Walsh上将要见你 少校
General Walsh needs to see you, Commander.

625
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:27,149
有关于士兵Lewis
It's about Private Lewis.

626
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:33,122
忠诚 荣誉 胜利
<i>Fide, Honorem, Victoria.</i>

627
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:38,294
是 长官
Yes, sir.

628
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:44,033
让队伍准备执行代号18
Prep the squad for Code 18.

629
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:45,768
-但是... -快去
- But... - Just do it!

630
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:51,173
- Christopher -怎么了
- Christopher? - What is it?

631
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:54,210
我不知道 但我有种不好的感觉
I don't know, but I don't have a good feeling about this.

632
00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:56,645
这里一定有什么事情
Something's definitely up over there.

633
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:11,760
有个身份号在两起谋杀发生的时候都不在这里
One ID shows off premises at the time of both murders.

634
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:14,096
狗牌 2476
Dog tag 2476.

635
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:14,096
{\a6}狗牌（身份牌），就是士兵的身份识别标志

636
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:15,364
247
247...

637
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:17,733
Max Cabral少校
Lieutenant Commander Max Cabral.

638
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:18,506
Max
Max?

639
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,203
是的 而且他的枪刚刚匹配上了
Yeah, well, his rifle just matched the bullets

640
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:21,437
杀死Noah律师的子弹
that killed JAG Noah.

641
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,671
这是什么
What's that?

642
00:28:22,673 --> 00:28:24,440
是全面封锁
It's a lockdown.

643
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:26,075
但我没有下指令
But I didn't order it.

644
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:31,447
哇哦 这到底是什么情况
Whoa! What the hell is going on?

645
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:34,516
我在保护学校 举起手来
I'm protecting the academy. Hands up!

646
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,519
走吧 快点
Let's go, come on.

647
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,421
过来 快点 快走
Down here. Come on, let's go.

648
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:04,656
不要向后看
Stop looking back.

649
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,192
继续走 快点
Keep going, come on!

650
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:12,064
你不知道你在干什么 孩子
You don't know what you're doing, son.

651
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,298
你不在理智思考
You're not thinking straight.

652
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,733
-这到底是在... -坐下
- What is this supposed to... - Sit down!

653
00:29:14,735 --> 00:29:16,502
坐下
Sit down!

654
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:19,672
-拿走他们的武器 -是 长官
- Pull their weapons. - Yes, sir.

655
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:31,116
你应该接这个电话 和他谈谈
You should answer that. Talk to him.

656
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:32,351
不 不要
No, don't.

657
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,586
不要
Don't.

658
00:29:34,588 --> 00:29:35,988
我们在严格执行命令
We're under strict orders.

659
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,524
命令 谁给的命令
Orders? Orders from who?

660
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,028
看着他们
Stand watch.

661
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,080
走走走
Go! Go! Go!

662
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:52,538
-没接电话 -没有 好奇怪
- No answer? - No. It's weird.

663
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,872
-Pride -有消息吗
- Pride. - Anything?

664
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:55,941
新奥尔良警方和路易斯安那州州警正在疏散学生
NOPD and LSP are evacuating the students.

665
00:29:55,943 --> 00:29:57,209
特别行动小组正在就位
SWAT's taking position.

666
00:29:57,211 --> 00:29:59,211
天啊 Dorsey
Geez-- Dorsey!

667
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:00,345
为什么特别行动小组在这里
Why is SWAT here?

668
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:02,181
Rita
Rita.

669
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:03,849
她叫了他们 这是用于重罪逮捕令的程序
She called them. It's procedure when serving felony warrants,

670
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:05,951
看情况 显然是被准许了
and in this case, it's obviously warranted.

671
00:30:05,953 --> 00:30:07,753
Christopher和Sonja在哪里
Where the hell are Christopher and Sonja?

672
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:08,987
警方看到一群人用枪指着他们
NOPD saw a squad of them take them

673
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:10,623
把他们带去了食堂
into the mess hall at gunpoint.

674
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:11,149
什么
What?

675
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:12,559
学生正在封锁窗户
Students were blocking the windows.

676
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,426
-没有人接电话 -这里的事态已经
- No one's answering. - Things are getting

677
00:30:14,428 --> 00:30:16,395
失去控制了 将军 赶紧行动
out of hand here, General. Fast.

678
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,830
Dorsey
Dorsey!

679
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:19,798
长官
Sir.

680
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,601
你刚和Cabral少校说话 他说了什么
You just spoke to Commander Cabral, what did he say?

681
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:23,936
他没说什么 我就告诉他
Well, he didn't say anything. I just told him

682
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:25,204
你想要和他谈谈关于Lewis的事情
you wanted to talk to him about Lewis,

683
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:26,872
然后他就发起了全面封锁
then he triggered a lockdown.

684
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:27,906
你不觉得
You don't think Cabral

685
00:30:27,908 --> 00:30:29,241
Cabral和这事情有关系吗
had anything to do with this, do you?

686
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:31,176
不不不 等等 我们现在知道的是
No, no, no. Hold on. All we know right now

687
00:30:31,178 --> 00:30:34,479
子弹匹配了Cabral的枪
is that the bullets match Cabral's rifle.

688
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:35,581
-就这些 -对
- That's it. - Right.

689
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,015
他为什么会把他的枪交给我们呢
Why would he hand us over his rifle

690
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:39,451
当我们问他要的时候 他都没有犹豫
when we asked for it, without even hesitating,

691
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:40,445
如果他知道这会跟凶器匹配的话
if he knew it was gonna match the murder weapon?

692
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:41,221
他不会
He wouldn't have

693
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:43,422
-让你去测试 -去找Loretta
- let you test it. - Get ahold of Loretta.

694
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,257
好 希望她能给一些答案
Okay, let's hope she's got some answers.

695
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:46,792
我们错过了一些细节
We're missing something here.

696
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:48,360
我还在试着建立通信
I'm still trying to establish communication

697
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:50,529
等待无人机 原地待命
and waiting on drones, stand by.

698
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:52,865
地方检察官Devereaux 这是怎么回事 发生了什么
A.D.A. Devereaux. What's going on? What happened?

699
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,333
军校学员封锁了学校
The cadets have locked down the school.

700
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:55,868
等等 就因为逮捕令吗
Wait, because of the warrants?

701
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,336
我们还没能联系到他们
We never got a chance to serve them.

702
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:58,871
现在 他们隐藏起来 全副武装
Now, they're ensconced, heavily armed

703
00:30:58,873 --> 00:30:59,905
他们有人质
and they've got hostages.

704
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:01,840
人质解救队多久能到
How long till HRT gets here?

705
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:03,575
15到20分钟
15 to 20 minutes,

706
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:06,945
但基于现在这种情况 我们等不了那么久
but based on the situation, we may not have that long.

707
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:08,881
我要在每扇窗和入口都安排狙击手
I want scopes in every window and access...

708
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:10,482
听着 我不想这事闹得这么大
Okay, look, I don't want this blowing up on us.

709
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:13,018
首先我们需要弄清楚他们想要什么
We need to find out what they want first.

710
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,953
这不是我决定的 而是取决于他们 但事实是
It's not up to me, it's up to them, but the fact is,

711
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:16,688
他们扣留了人质
is they've taken hostages.

712
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,956
嘿 他们会听我的
Hey, they'll listen to me.

713
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,858
让我进去 跟Cabral少校谈谈
Let me go in, talk to Commander Cabral.

714
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,994
我是他的指挥官 他会按我说的做
I'm his commanding officer, he'll do whatever I say.

715
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:24,129
这也许是救他们的唯一办法
It may be the only way to save them.

716
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:37,175
Terrence Lewis头上的致命击打伤
The lethal blow to the head on Terrence Lewis

717
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:39,011
是在凌辱之后发生的
was administered after the hazing.

718
00:31:39,013 --> 00:31:40,045
之后多久
How long after?

719
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:41,780
12 15小时
12, 15 hours.

720
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:43,048
所以说 不是凌辱造成的
So, it's not due to the hazing?

721
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,950
除非Lewis事后威胁说要告诉别人
Unless Lewis threatened to tell somebody

722
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:46,485
然后就被杀了
after the fact, and got killed later.

723
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,886
好吧 这还不足以
Yeah, there's still not enough there

724
00:31:47,888 --> 00:31:49,855
洗脱Cabral少校的嫌疑
to let Commander Cabral off the hook.

725
00:31:49,857 --> 00:31:51,723
知道凶器是什么吗
Any idea what the murder weapon was?

726
00:31:51,725 --> 00:31:54,793
不知道 但我确实发现了一些奇怪的细节
No, but I did find some curious details.

727
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:56,228
我在男孩的颅骨里
I found a sliver of wood

728
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,764
发现了一片木屑 不是普通的木头
in the boy's skull, not just any wood,

729
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:00,432
是200年树龄的西洋杉
but 200-year-old cedar.

730
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:04,036
还有微量的硫磺 炭 硝石
Also, trace amounts of sulfur, charcoal, saltpeter.

731
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:05,904
这听起来像是黑火药
That sounds like black gunpowder.

732
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:08,507
黑火药 你是说 可能源于内战时期
Black gunpowder, you mean, like from the Civil War?

733
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,542
是的
Yeah.

734
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:12,744
Pride 怎么了
Pride, what is it?

735
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:14,479
Sebastian
Sebastian,

736
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:18,116
如果有人使劲用这些旧的步枪击打
if somebody swung one of these old rifles hard enough,

737
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:20,285
微量的黑火药会...
could trace amounts of black gunpowder...

738
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:21,520
被晃出来 最终嵌入
Get dislodged, and end up embedded

739
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,188
颅骨吗 肯定会
in the skull? Absolutely.

740
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:27,259
上将 知不知道遗失的步枪在哪里
Any idea where the missing rifle is, General?

741
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:29,194
我从没注意到它丢了
I never even noticed it was gone.

742
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:31,496
还有谁有权进入这间办公室
Who else has access to the office?

743
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:32,798
Dorsey上校
Captain Dorsey.

744
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,032
Dorsey在哪里
Where is Dorsey?

745
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:40,072
这不是谈判
This is not a negotiation.

746
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:42,407
我们没有选择 上尉
We don't have a choice, Lieutenant.

747
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:44,309
我只是说 也许我们应该听他们的
All I'm saying is maybe we should listen to them.

748
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:45,544
我们没做错什么事
We didn't do anything wrong.

749
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,312
Lewis是因我们而死
Lewis is dead because of us!

750
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:49,314
我们是奉命去凌辱他
We were ordered to haze him,

751
00:32:49,316 --> 00:32:51,917
就像现在我们也是在奉命行事
just like we were ordered to do this.

752
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,086
我们没有杀Lewis 更没有杀Noah律师
We didn't kill Lewis any more than we killed JAG Noah.

753
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:56,455
你认为外面的人会在乎这个吗
You think anyone outside of here cares about that?

754
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:58,190
这里所代表的一切都处于危险中
Everything this place stands for is on the line.

755
00:32:58,192 --> 00:32:59,524
你明白吗
Do you understand?

756
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:01,960
我们服从命令 就这样
We follow orders. Period.

757
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:04,496
但是最初 正是服从命令才让我们
But following orders is what got us into this mess

758
00:33:04,498 --> 00:33:06,164
陷入这件事
in the first place.

759
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,737
Rita
Rita!

760
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:15,474
我很抱歉这么说 Dwayne 但我认为这证明了
I'm sorry to say this, Dwayne, but I think this proves

761
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:17,009
我对学员的看法是对的
I was right about the cadets.

762
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:18,844
事实上 我认为他们被陷害了
Actually, I think they're being set up.

763
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:21,113
我认为不是学员们杀了Lewis或者Noah
I don't think any of the cadets killed Lewis or Noah.

764
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:24,182
-证据呢 -你看到Dorsey上校了吗
- Based on what? - Have you seen Captain Dorsey?

765
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:26,051
Dorsey 我们刚让他进去 怎么了
Dorsey, we just sent him inside. Why?

766
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:38,597
原地候命
Stand down.

767
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:46,371
你本该控制住局面的 学员
You were supposed to contain the situation, Cadet.

768
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:49,107
现在我得来收拾摊子
Now I have to clean it up.

769
00:33:50,477 --> 00:33:51,810
跟我来
With me.

770
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:11,998
我想说的是 情况可能不像看起来那样
All I'm saying is, the situation may not be as it appears.

771
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,166
我们认为Cabral少校
We think Commander Cabral's

772
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,735
被你们刚放进去的人陷害了
being set up by the man you just let inside.

773
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:17,537
Cabral扣留了两名你的人当人质
Cabral is holding two of your own people hostage.

774
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:19,439
他只是在服从命令
He's just following orders.

775
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:21,541
我也一样 我的工作是清除危险 Pride探员
And so am I. My job is clear, Agent Pride,

776
00:34:21,543 --> 00:34:23,810
就是要尽我所能去缓和局势
and that's to defuse the situation any way I can.

777
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,812
-Dugan -失陪
- Dugan? - Excuse me.

778
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,313
这说不通
This doesn't make any sense.

779
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,681
如果你是对的 那些男孩是无罪的
If you're right, and the boys are innocent,

780
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:31,284
为什么要这么做 为什么要扣留人质
why do this? Why take hostages?

781
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,519
整个改造的前提是教会学员们
The whole premise of reform here is to teach cadets

782
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:34,887
绝对服从命令
to obey orders without question,

783
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,023
把军校放在第一位
to put the academy first.

784
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:39,459
显然 Dorsey利用了这点
Obviously, Dorsey took advantage of that.

785
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:42,395
等等 你是说Dorsey杀了Noah和Lewis 为什么
Wait, you're saying Dorsey killed Noah and, and Lewis? Why?

786
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:44,631
-Pride -跟我说说情况
- Pride. - Talk to me.

787
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:47,066
上将让我查阅了Dorsey的人事档案
The general got me access to Dorsey's personnel files.

788
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,102
看样子 在上一位上将死后
Apparently, he applied to take over the academy

789
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:51,904
他申请了接管学校 但是却由Walsh接管了
after the last general died, but Walsh got it instead.

790
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,806
-这不是谋杀的动机 -是的
- That's not motivation for murder. - Well, no.

791
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:55,942
但他被否决的主要原因却可能成为动机
But the main reason that he got passed over might be.

792
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:57,377
Dorsey曾多次因滥用职权
See, Dorsey had been reprimanded several times

793
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,678
而被谴责
for abuse of authority,

794
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,880
包括下达凌辱学员的命令
including ordering the hazing of cadets.

795
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,516
所以Lewis这事做得过火了
So things with Lewis went too far,

796
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,252
不受他们失控了 Noah律师发现了
they got out of hand, JAG Noah figured it out...

797
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,420
他不得不也杀了他
And he had to kill him, too.

798
00:35:07,422 --> 00:35:08,788
还是解释不了为什么Cabral
Still doesn't explain why Cabral

799
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,290
封锁了学校
locked down the school.

800
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:11,991
不 可以解释
No, it does.

801
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:14,694
这能说通 如果他是奉了Dorsey的命令
It does, if he's following Dorsey's orders.

802
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:18,331
而Dorsey想让Max看起来有罪...
And if Dorsey's trying to make Max look guilty...

803
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:21,634
Gregorio在哪里
Where's Gregorio?

804
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,570
我们只有一次机会
We only got one shot at this.

805
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:28,174
收到 Pride 我只希望我们有足够的时间
Got it, Pride. I just hope we have enough time.

806
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:31,678
嘿 如果你是无罪的
Hey. If you're innocent,

807
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,480
如果Max是无罪的 我们可以证明
if Max is innocent, we can prove it,

808
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:36,382
但不是这样
But not like this.

809
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,785
除此之外 就连军队都会不遵守命令
Besides, even the military's not supposed to follow orders

810
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:40,253
如果命令是不合法的
if they're illegal,

811
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:42,722
或者犯法的 嘿 你也一样
or criminal... hey, and neither are you.

812
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,457
如果你想做正确的事
Look, if you want to do what's right?

813
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:45,892
你怎么回事
What is wrong with you?

814
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,328
我们可以趁早停止这些
We can stop this before it's too late.

815
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,330
你能阻止
You can stop this.

816
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:52,732
但请你
But please,

817
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,934
让我们走
let us go.

818
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:02,175
你是军队的耻辱
You are an embarrassment to the uniform.

819
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:03,943
这是你的烂摊子 少校
This is your mess, Commander.

820
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,244
我是服从你的命令
I was following your orders.

821
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,280
我的命令是保护学校
My orders were to protect the academy,

822
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:08,815
不是把它置于险境
not to put it at risk,

823
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:10,583
而那却是你所做的
which is exactly what you've done.

824
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,972
你到底在想什么
What the hell were you thinking?

825
00:36:11,996 --> 00:36:13,220
你是开始这一切的人
You're the one that started this.

826
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:15,588
是你让我凌辱Lewis 吓吓他
You're the one that told me to haze Lewis, scare him straight.

827
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,423
但你做过头了 不是吗
But you went too far, didn't you?

828
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,991
Lewis威胁说要把事情抖出来
Lewis threatened to expose it,

829
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:20,927
但那就破坏了学校的制度
but that would've brought down the very institution

830
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,095
你就要在监狱里
that's kept you from spending the rest

831
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,763
度过你可怜的余生
of your sorry-ass life in prison.

832
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,098
我没有杀Lewis
I didn't kill Lewis!

833
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,499
但我不得不
But I had to!

834
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:28,000
为了保护学校
To protect the academy

835
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:29,669
免受同样的混乱
from the same mess.

836
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:31,671
那Noah律师呢
What about JAG Noah?

837
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:33,773
也算你头上
Also on you.

838
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,275
在他弄明白发生了什么之后
After he figured out what happened,

839
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,977
找到了Lewis的尸体
tracked down Lewis's body,

840
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:41,481
我必须做点什么 来保护我们免遭你的连累
I had to do something to protect us all from your screwups!

841
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:43,349
忠诚高于一切
Loyalty above all else!

842
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,019
记得吗
Remember that?

843
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:49,021
那是这个地方所代表的意义
That's what this place stands for.

844
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:51,624
但显然你没有做到
But that's something you obviously don't get.

845
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,992
你是个失败者 Cabral
You're a failure, Cabral,

846
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:55,294
对你自己 对学校 都是失败者
a failure to yourself, and this institution.

847
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,897
你应该为你自己感到羞耻
You should be ashamed of yourself!

848
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,300
我可以开火吗
Do I have permission to fire?

849
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,869
你以为你控制了一切吗
You think you got the balls?

850
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:05,705
来啊 开枪啊 朝我开枪
Go ahead, pull the trigger! Shoot me!

851
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:08,007
不行 但我可以 挪开
No, but I do. Move.

852
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,446
来啊
Do it!

853
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:23,322
联邦探员 不许动
Federal agents! Don't move!

854
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,358
举起手来
Put your hands up!

855
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,470
警报解除 警报解除
All clear, all clear.

856
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:39,105
漂亮的一枪 Gregorio
Nice shot, Gregorio.

857
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:40,506
我知道你可以做到
I knew you could do it.

858
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,741
等你下来了再见
See you when you get back down here.

859
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:42,708
收到
Copy that.

860
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,076
只是出于好奇
Just out of curiosity,

861
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:45,244
你怎么知道那个计划可行
how'd you know that would work?

862
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:46,712
那是Dorsey的计划吗
That that was Dorsey's plan?

863
00:37:46,714 --> 00:37:48,781
我不知道 我不清楚
I didn't, but I couldn't figure out

864
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:50,383
他还会做什么
what else he was gonna do.

865
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:53,486
穷途末路 知道我们要逮捕他
Backed in the corner, knew we were onto him,

866
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:55,121
假设事态会升级
assumed things would escalate.

867
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:57,723
所以 换句话说 这只是直觉吗
So, in other words, it was just a hunch?

868
00:37:57,725 --> 00:38:00,426
我更乐意说是"有依据的推测"
I prefer “educated guess.”

869
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:18,144
还是不能完全了解他
Still can't quite figure him out.

870
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:20,646
了解谁 Pride吗
Figure out who? Pride?

871
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:22,281
-对 -他有什么好了解的
- Yeah. - What's there to figure out?

872
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:23,483
他就是那种人啊
He's the man.

873
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:25,284
我想她说的是他的私生活
I think she's talking about his personal life.

874
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:26,652
哦
Oh.

875
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:28,221
弹钢琴是他的私生活
Yeah, but playing piano is his personal life.

876
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,922
不 还有比这个更私密的事情
Nah, there's got to be more to it than that.

877
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:31,524
他这么优质的男人
He's such a good catch.

878
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:35,628
他不应该被人勾搭吗 不是吗
I mean, he should be hooked up with someone, no?

879
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:41,801
把话说清楚 现在聊的只是出于职业好奇
Talking professional curiosity here, let's just be clear.

880
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,970
King并不急着
Look, King is not in a hurry to get together

881
00:38:43,972 --> 00:38:45,404
找个人在一起
with anyone anytime soon.

882
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,840
他喜欢当King
He's just happy being King.

883
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:49,775
没错 好吧 像我刚刚说的
It's true. Okay. Well, like I said,

884
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:52,478
他是个优质男 只是不大符合常理罢了
he's a great catch, and it's just not natural.

885
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,881
你只是因为输掉了关于Rita的打赌而不爽
You're just cranky that you lost the bet about Rita.

886
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:57,083
-对了 -没错 我都忘了
- Bingo. - Exactly! I forgot.

887
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:57,483
我有不爽吗
I'm cranky? I'm cranky?

888
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:00,253
-对 你有 -那她为什么来了
- Yeah, you cranky. - Then why is she here?

889
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,787
啊哈
Huh?

890
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:10,763
看来你还记得我的话
I see I made an impression on you.

891
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,865
是吗 弹的怎么样
Oh, yeah? How's that?

892
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,301
轻敲琴键 没那么紧绷了
Lighter touch on the keys, less tense.

893
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:17,069
好吧 你非常有自信
All right, you're pretty confident.

894
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:18,604
还好啦
Uh, not so much.

895
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,274
在我差点酿成惨剧之后 就没那么自信了
Certainly not after I nearly caused a disaster.

896
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,708
你太苛责你自己了
You're being too hard on yourself.

897
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,677
还有什么新鲜的
Eh. What else is new?

898
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:26,512
我早该知道
I should've known better.

899
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,914
我应该记住的
I should've remembered.

900
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:30,116
永远不要和你的直觉过不去
Never go up against one of your hunches.

901
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,486
我不知道 我的方法也有跑偏的时候
Oh, I don't know, my way could've gone sideways, too.

902
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,555
鉴于那些孩子在上军校前
Troubled history those kids had even before

903
00:39:35,557 --> 00:39:37,290
问题重重的历史 很难不想到
they get to the academy, hard not to think

904
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,825
无风不起浪
that where there's smoke, there's fire.

905
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:41,894
这就是Dorsey上校希望
Well, certainly what Captain Dorsey was hoping

906
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:43,729
让大家相信的事情
to make everybody believe.

907
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:45,831
地方检察署认为他不仅试图陷害Max
D.A. thinks he wasn't just trying to frame Max,

908
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:48,634
还想让Walsh难看 这样他就能接管学校
but also make Walsh look bad so he could take over.

909
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,404
可是却差点搞垮了学校
Almost brought down the academy instead.

910
00:39:51,406 --> 00:39:53,806
谢谢为他们的行为说了好话
Thanks for putting in a good word on their behalf.

911
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,609
这是我最起码能做的事情了
Oh, it's the least I could do.

912
00:39:56,611 --> 00:40:00,947
毕竟 那些孩子值得拥有第二次机会
After all, those boys deserve a second chance.

913
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:02,682
没错 我同意
Yeah, I agree with that.

914
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,519
继续说
Yeah, go ahead.

915
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:08,621
对了
By the way...

916
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,158
记得这个吗
Remember this one?

917
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,061
别 拜托 别弹那个
No-- don't. Please, don't go there.

918
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:16,829
怎么 你害怕了
What, are you scared?

919
