For how long?

117

The last time
anybody heard from him

118
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:57,670
was the night before last.

119
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,138
Called a fellow JAG.

120
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,274
Said he had something sensitive
to discuss with her,

121
00:05:02,276 --> 00:05:03,208
but never showed.

122

00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:10,482

Knows he wouldn't have called

126
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:11,717
if it wasn't important.

127
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,285

Yeah, we both do.

GREGORIO: Rita?

PRIDE:
Sorry.

JAG Devereaux and I

132
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:21,560
went to his apartment
last night,

133
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:24,563
but there were no signs of him
or his car.

134
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:26,432
Well, still, it's only been
a day and a half.

135
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:28,500

we're talking about here.

Sorry. Look, I...

140
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,113
I admit there's nothing
much to go on here yet,

141
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:42,848
but I've known
Rita a long time.

142
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,984
She's not one to panic easily.

143
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:46,018
She's concerned.

144
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,453
I told her we'd help.

145
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:49,788
A friend of yours
is a friend of ours, King.

was there was nothing
on his computer.

149
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:57,463
Nothing?
Like it had been erased?

150
00:05:57,465 --> 00:06:00,132
Yeah. I want you and Patton
to work on it.

151
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:02,301
Maybe see if you can restore
what was on it.

152
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:04,003

00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,826
Classified cases--
do we have access?

166
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:29,561
Yeah, we do,
and Rita will meet us there

167
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,163
to help us sort things out.

168
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:32,464
Okay, then.

169
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:35,701
Look forward to meeting
this <i>Rita.</i>

170
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:41,707
Don't get me wrong.

171
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,509
If there's anything I've
learned since I got here,

172
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:45,444
is you have a definite
nose for justice.

173
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,647
It's just, you know, unusual way
of taking the case, is all.

174
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,149
What are you trying
to get at, Gregorio?

175
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:51,417
No, nothing.
I'm just saying,

176
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,685
we usually start things
off with an actual crime.

177
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:55,020
Phone call, a body.

178
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:58,323
But here, banking a lot on
this Rita friend of yours.

179
00:06:58,325 --> 00:06:59,925
You must have good reason
to trust her instincts.

180
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:00,859
I do.

181
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:01,760
Oh.

182
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:04,430
Keep fishing, New York.

183
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,333
RITA:
Thanks for doing this, Dwayne.

184
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:10,169
No thanks necessary.

185
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:12,004
Special Agent Tammy Gregorio,

186
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:14,706
Assistant District Attorney,
Reserve Naval Commander,

187
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,342
JAG Corps Rita Devereaux.

188
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:18,744
Lot of titles, I know.

189
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:20,112
You can call me Rita.

190
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:21,580
Nice to meet you, Rita.

191
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:23,782
D.A. get us any access?

192
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:26,752
Had to go back on active
duty to get it, but yes.

193
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,587
Glad the uniform still fits.
It's been a while.

194
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:29,922
No, you look great.

195
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:31,123
Thank you.
Yeah.

196
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,292
Ladies? Yeah.

197
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:35,994
We find anything in Noah's
case files that might help?

198
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:39,398
No, nothing yet, unfortunately.

199
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,467
I've gone through all
his current JAG caseload,

200
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,802
but although sensitive,

201
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:45,871
nothing stands out
as suspicious.

202
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:47,806
What about his computer?
Has that been erased, too?

203
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:49,441
No, it seems to be intact.

204
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,643
His last entry
was calendaring the meet

205
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,779
he wanted to have with me
tomorrow morning.

206
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:55,914
Home computer wiped,
office not?

207
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,516
If Noah's really missing,

208
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,818
could be more of a personal
nature than business.

209
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,186
Gregorio's right.

210
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,387
If there aren't any leads here,

211
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,323
but there were
at his apartment...

212
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,191
Look, you knew him well.

213
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:07,993
What did he do
with his personal time?

214
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:09,695
We really haven't had a chance
to catch up

215
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,563
since I moved back here
a couple months ago.

216
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:13,132
Oh, you lived in New Orleans?

217
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,633
Long time ago, way, way back

218
00:08:14,635 --> 00:08:16,468
when I first met Dwayne.

219
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,538
Looks like Noah was pretty
involved with Fort MacArthur.

220
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,939
GREGORIO:
What's Fort MacArthur?

221
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:23,242
Private military academy
outside the city.

222
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:26,111
Town has a long-standing history
with the school.

223
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:28,580
Takes in troubled juvies
with criminal records.

224
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:30,782
Place is their last shot
at turning their lives around.

225
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:32,417
RITA: Just like it
did for Noah.

226
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,919
Academy offered him
structure and direction.

227
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,354
It's why he joined the Navy.

228
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:37,456
And why he's been
volunteering there ever since.

229
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,591
He likes to give back.

230
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,293
A lot like you, actually.

231
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:45,264
GREGORIO:
Looks like your friend

232
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:47,533
was doing more
than volunteering.

233
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:49,434
Student files, log books,

234
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:50,903
leave requests,

235
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,070
blueprints
of the school's ground.

236
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,405
I mean, it almost feels like
(phone rings)

237
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,641
he was investigating
something there.

238
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:58,677
I wonder what.

239
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,480
What you got, Sebastian?

240
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:02,714
Okay.

241
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:03,982
We're on our way.
Uh, tell Christopher

242
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:05,984
we'll meet them there.

243
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:08,887
Noah's computer
was erased remotely,

244
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:12,824
but they were able to trace
the IP address to his laptop.

245
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:14,760
Call me. Good or bad.

246
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,161
Promise.

247
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,476
Noah Sandler's vehicle.

248
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:34,446
Judging by the tire tracks,
it sat here overnight.

249
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,448
Any sign of Noah?
Not yet.

250
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,650
Any idea what he was doing
all the way out here?

251
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:40,052
Well, it could have been
gator hunt.

252
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:41,420
Got the gear.

253
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:43,689
It's a popular spot, but
you got to have courage.

254
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:45,090
Meaning?

255
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:47,426
(sighs) Lake Verret's
not the safest place to hunt.

256
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:48,527
PRIDE: It's pretty
remote and dangerous.

257
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,896
Nobody usually
comes out here alone.

258
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:53,932
Found the laptop,
but it's been wiped clean, too.

259
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,500
And according to Sebastian,

260
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:58,437
it was used to remotely erase
Noah's home computer first.

261
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:01,406
Noah didn't come all the way
out here to erase computers.

262
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:04,042
King.

263
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:21,560
Whoa.

264
00:10:21,562 --> 00:10:24,296
(growling)

265
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:27,933
Hyah. Get back.
Hyah.

266
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,901
(growling)
Hyah. Get back.

267
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:31,737
Get back.

268
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:33,672
Hyah. Yeah.

269
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,742
(hisses)
Get back.

270
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:38,477
Hyah.

271
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:44,082
It's probably Noah.

272
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:49,221
Looks like he's been shot twice.

273
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:52,958
Which means our missing persons
case just turned into a murder.

274
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:07,924
SEBASTIAN:
Hey, Doc Wade call you yet?

275
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:08,729
No, why?

276
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,897
She just finished her
prelim autopsy on JAG Noah.

277
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,165
Turns out you were right.

278
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,466
He was shot twice in the back.

279
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:14,967
Hunting accident?

280
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:16,536
I don't think so.
It was a tight pattern,

281
00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:17,737
and both went
right through the heart.

282
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:19,572
Kill shots.

283
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:21,841
Question is,
who killed him and why?

284
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:24,110
Looked like he drove out there
by himself.

285
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:25,578
Someone lying in wait,

286
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,647
hoping to make it look
like a hunting accident?

287
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,482
Yeah, how'd they know
he'd even be out there?

288
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:30,650
And why was he there?

289
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:32,218
Calls your friend Rita,

290
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,587
says he wants to discuss
a sensitive case with her.

291
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:36,289
Well, it had to be connected
to whatever case

292
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,690
he wanted to talk to her about,
right?

293
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,358
And told her it was important.

294
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,295
Thing is, if Rita hadn't come
to me when she did,

295
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:44,330
probably never would have found
Noah's body.

296
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:46,098
Gators would have made sure
of that.

297
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,034
Was probably what the killer
was hoping for.

298
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:49,769
You and Patton have any luck
figuring out

299
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:51,804
what was on Noah's computers
before they got erased?

300
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:54,373
Nada. We even hacked into the
cloud to check the data stream.

301
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,641
Which means whoever it was

302
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:57,143
went through
an awful lot of trouble

303
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,579
to cover up
whatever Noah was working on.

304
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:00,813
RITA:
Any word?

305
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:08,855
You said you would call.

306
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:10,857
I know. But we just got back,

307
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:14,827
and I...
I wanted to be sure first.

308
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:16,762
Sure of what?

309
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:18,731
Good or bad, you
wanted to know.

310
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,533
It's not good.

311
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:22,535
Noah was murdered, Rita.

312
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:24,303
He was shot.

313
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:27,206
What?

314
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,574
How? Who?

315
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:29,809
I don't know.

316
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:32,879
We just started
the investigation.

317
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:35,548
I assume that...

318
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,684
that you've kept looking.

319
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:41,387
Any idea what Noah wanted
to talk to you about yet?

320
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,022
What was so important?

321
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:46,759
I, uh...

322
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:50,963
I think it had something to do
with Terrence Lewis.

323
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:52,365
He's one of the cadets

324
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,467
that Noah was mentoring
at the academy.

325
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:56,869
I started looking more

326
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:59,839
into Noah's Fort MacArthur
connections after you left.

327
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,807
What's so special
about Lewis?

328
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,676
Uh, Noah had requested

329
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:06,078
the boy's
juvenile criminal file,

330
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,980
but JAGs can't access
a minor's record

331
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:09,315
without a court order.

332
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:12,919
But A.D.A.s can, and
you're thinking that, uh,

333
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,788
he called you, hoping you
could get him the files?

334
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,456
Troubled kid, Terrence Lewis.

335
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,525
Assault, armed robbery,

336
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:22,061
and it doesn't look like he got
reformed at the academy, either.

337
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:23,462
Kept getting into trouble,

338
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:25,298
both in and out
of Fort MacArthur.

339
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,068
If Terrence Lewis knew
Noah was investigating him...

340
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,803
He might have killed
him so he couldn't?

341
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:32,738
That's a stretch.

342
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,340
I'm just looking
at the facts, Dwayne.

343
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:35,808
It's what I do.

344
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,478
And I'm sorry, but not every kid
can be reformed.

345
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,580
And Lewis looks like he wasn't.

346
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:44,917
Violent background,
access to weapons,

347
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,321
and then Noah gets shot to death
before we can even meet?

348
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:51,557
If that's not probable cause,
I don't know what is.

349
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:54,694
Don't want to rush
to judgment here.

350
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:57,630
Especially when it comes
to the kids at the academy.

351
00:13:57,632 --> 00:14:00,333
Suspects are suspects,
regardless of age.

352
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:02,401
Look, I know that
Noah was your friend.

353
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:03,703
That's got nothing to do
with this.

354
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:05,805
It does when you're
not thinking straight

355
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:08,074
'cause you're loaded for bear.

356
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:11,510
(exhales)

357
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:16,816
Might be the first argument
I ever won with you.

358
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:21,420
I got a good team here, Rita.

359
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:24,457
They're good at their jobs.

360
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,860
Let us investigate
Terrence Lewis

361
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:29,295
and whatever connection

362
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:31,864
the academy may or may
not have had in this,

363
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:36,402
and I promise we'll find
out who killed Noah.

364
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,306
Okay.

365
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:42,742
But if you don't, I will.

366
00:14:56,824 --> 00:14:58,891
(guns firing,
drill commands shouted)

367
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:10,836
(drums playing)

368
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:18,511
Agent Pride?
General Walsh.

369
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:21,013
Heard a lot about you.
It's nice to finally meet you.

370
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:22,181
PRIDE:
You, too, General.

371
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:24,550
Special Agents Percy
and Lasalle.

372
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:25,684
Welcome.
Hey, General.

373
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:26,952
Welcome.
Thank you.

374
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:28,888
DRILL SERGEANT:
Atten-hut.

375
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,156
WALSH:
<i>So...</i>

376
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,857
what brings NCIS
to Fort MacArthur?

377
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:35,027
Well, probably best to
discuss in private.

378
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:36,695
Minors around,

379
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,831
want to handle this as
sensitively as possible.

380
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,000
Understood...
and appreciated.

381
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:44,036
Especially considering where
most of our cadets come from.

382
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:47,073
Law tends to assume
the worst about them.

383
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:51,043
Uh, General Sklahr, who is that?

384
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:53,712
PRIDE: He was the man who
practically founded this place.

385
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:55,047
You're familiar?

386
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:56,882
Hard to grow up in
this town and not be.

387
00:15:56,884 --> 00:16:00,352
All the good he did,
troubled kids he helped.

388
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:02,888
WALSH: He gave 'em a home,
a second chance.

389
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,223
General Sklahr
was the father figure

390
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:05,991
most of these boys
didn't have.

391
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,993
That's large shoes to fill.

392
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:10,629
Proud to have been appointed
to do exactly that.

393
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:13,666
Although,
easier said than done.

394
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:15,734
COMMANDING OFFICER:
Halt!

395
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,570
CADETS:
♪ The military live... ♪

396
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:23,542
So, which of my boys
is in trouble?

397
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:25,244
Well, not sure
any are yet.

398
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:26,645
That's why we're here.

399
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:29,348
Hoping for an assist.

400
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,917
We'd like to talk with one
of your cadets, Terrence Lewis.

401
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,253
Well, so would I.

402
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,789
Private Lewis has been UA
for three weeks now.

403
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,525
Wish I could say
that was unusual.

404
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:41,260
LASALLE: Lewis
go missing often?

405
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:43,295
Unfortunately, yes.

406
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,766
We take pride here
in reforming boys,

407
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:49,468
teaching 'em
to obey orders,

408
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,838
how to commit to something
larger than themselves.

409
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,707
But, we're not
always successful

410
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,242
and I'm afraid
that includes Private Lewis.

411
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:58,344
You notify NOPD
he was missing?

412
00:16:58,346 --> 00:16:59,411
They don't
have the manpower

413
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:01,714
to chase down runaways and...

414
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:04,483
juvies like Lewis
aren't a high priority.

415
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,018
What's he done?

416
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,954
Again, not sure, but, uh...

417
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:13,926
I'm sorry to say,

418
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:16,862
JAG Noah Sandler
has been murdered.

419
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,167
And Terrence Lewis
is a person of interest.

420
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,804
(sighs)
Noah, my God.

421
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:27,673
How, when?

422
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,608
Last night.

423
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,546
And what we know now is:
Noah was investigating Lewis.

424
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:35,414
And maybe even the academy.

425
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,949
Investigating?

426
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:38,851
Noah never said anything to me
about it

427
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,953
and he was here all the time.

428
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:43,856
He mentored lots of boys,
not just Private Lewis.

429
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:46,258
Is it all right if we speak
with Lewis' commanding officer?

430
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,694
Of course. Uh...

431
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:52,031
Dorsey,
come in here, please.

432
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:56,368
Sir?

433
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,971
These are NCIS agents,
Captain Dorsey.

434
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:00,673
They need to speak
to Commander Cabral ASAP.

435
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:02,942
Yes, sir. Right this way.

436
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,812
Agent Pride?

437
00:18:06,814 --> 00:18:10,649
This news of Noah's death
is gonna hit the boys hard.

438
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,352
I'd rather they hear it from me,
if that's all right with you.

439
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:15,221
Yes, sir.

440
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:21,393
(sighs)

441
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:25,097
(door opens)

442
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,899
What do we got,
Loretta?

443
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:29,868
I'm sorry, that was way too much
like Pride.

444
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,804
That was awful.
God, I got to work on that.

445
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,472
I'll work on it,
it's gonna be fine.

446
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:36,742
Stop trying so hard, Sebastian,
you're doing fine.

447
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:38,677
I know, I know, I know,
it's just...

448
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,381
still trying to find
my NCIS way, I guess. You know?

449
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:44,116
Maybe I should
keep the moped.

450
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:45,851
You here for an update?

451
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:47,753
I am. Yeah,
inquiring minds want to know.

452
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,255
Especially Pride's.

453
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:51,924
Well, obviously, an intact body
would have helped,

454
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:54,927
but from the pattern of the cuts
and abrasions I've seen,

455
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:57,496
coupled with the lack
of coagulation,

456
00:18:57,498 --> 00:19:01,800
it appears JAG Noah's body
was dragged postmortem.

457
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:03,602
Because of Tick-Tock Croc?

458
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:06,939
It's a <i>Peter Pan</i> reference.

459
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:08,474
Anyway,

460
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:10,109
the alligator bite pattern
didn't match

461
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:13,379
the indicated direction
of the cuts, so...

462
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:15,881
So the killer must have
dragged Noah after he shot him,

463
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:17,416
closer to the water.

464
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:20,552
Hoping the alligators
would devour the evidence, yes.

465
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:22,488
(sighs)
Doesn't really get us any closer

466
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,990
to IDing the killer, though.

467
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:26,625
Is there any way
that we can, uh,

468
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,327
narrow down what type
of gun was used?

469
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,663
It was definitely
an automatic rifle of some kind.

470
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:32,498
Based on the...

471
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,667
entry wound,
probably military.

472
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:37,336
I can't be sure until
you find me the projectiles.

473
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:39,138
Yeah, well, good luck
with that, right?

474
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,940
A high-powered rifle, bullets
went right through the body,

475
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:44,209
it's probably buried
back in the bayou somewhere.

476
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:45,804
Mm-hmm. Sounds like
a field trip to me.

477
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:47,346
Yeah.

478
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:49,315
Wait, do you mean me?

479
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:53,085
You-- you want me to go
back out there

480
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:55,521
to deadly gator-world?
By myself?

481
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:57,956
Tick-Tock Croc.

482
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:00,492
(sighs)

483
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:03,295
All right.

484
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:04,963
I'll see you never.

485
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:06,765
(door opens)

486
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:08,067
DORSEY:
<i>Platoon, atten-hut!</i>

487
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:09,568
Good afternoon, sir.

488
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,936
At ease, Commander.

489
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:13,138
Commander Cabral,
these are NCIS agents.

490
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,973
They need to speak
with you in private.

491
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,643
Of course, sir.

492
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:19,311
Cole, front and center.

493
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:23,749
Your command, Lieutenant.

494
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:25,651
Aye, sir.

495
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:30,089
Still can't wrap
my head around

496
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,291
how teaching juvies
to shoot M16s

497
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:34,059
helps reform them.

498
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:36,495
Well, it's not about that.
It teaches them responsibility.

499
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:38,564
At least this place
gives them a chance.

500
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:40,165
Port arms!

501
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,335
How can I be of assistance?

502
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,937
I understand Terrence Lewis

503
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,705
was in your squad,
Commander?

504
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:49,241
<i>Is</i> in my squad.
Yes, sir.

505
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:50,976
Although, currently,
Private Lewis is...

506
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:53,145
UA, I know.
How well do you know him?

507
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:56,515
General Walsh assigned him
to my squad three months ago.

508
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:58,650
Hoped I could
straighten him out.

509
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:01,687
How so?
Permission to speak freely?

510
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:04,256
We're just looking
for answers.

511
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:05,724
However you can help.

512
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:09,862
Private Lewis was
a difficult recruit.

513
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,997
The academy prides itself

514
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,868
on strength through loyalty,
following orders.

515
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,103
Lewis fought it
every step of the way.

516
00:21:18,105 --> 00:21:20,839
So I take it you and Lewis
didn't get along very well.

517
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:23,542
Lewis didn't get along
with anyone very well.

518
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:26,712
What about JAG Noah?
JAG...

519
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:29,615
He's the best, he's always
been there for us.

520
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:32,284
Lewis, too, but...

521
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:33,786
But what, son?

522
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,757
Just a few weeks ago,
JAG Noah tried to help Lewis

523
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,726
with some stuff
he was going through.

524
00:21:40,728 --> 00:21:43,195
But Lewis got mad.

525
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:44,797
Violent, even.

526
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,232
Hit JAG Noah-- hard, too.

527
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:50,736
That's the last anyone
ever saw of him.

528
00:21:55,075 --> 00:21:56,175
(device beeping slowly)

529
00:21:56,177 --> 00:21:58,010
(loud growl)
What the...?

530
00:22:04,552 --> 00:22:07,252
(beeping)

531
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:19,031
(beeping rapidly)

532
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:22,134
Bingo.

533
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:38,484
Okay.

534
00:22:41,255 --> 00:22:42,654
(beeping steadily)

535
00:22:46,694 --> 00:22:48,660
(beeping rapidly)

536
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:56,034
Oh, my God!

537
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,726
Judging by the rate
of decomposition,

538
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:13,362
I'd estimate the boy died
about three weeks ago.

539
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:15,364
SEBASTIAN:
Same time Lewis went UA.

540
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:16,365
Cause of death?

541
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:17,366
WADE: Your missing cadet

542
00:23:17,368 --> 00:23:18,834
was obviously beaten.

543
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:20,736
Even after all this time,
bruises on his face,

544
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:22,505
arms, and chest
are still evident.

545
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:24,840
Yeah, more interesting, though,
is what was used to beat him.

546
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:26,542
Yes, we recovered
the same substance

547
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:29,145
found in the epidermis
of the bruises--

548
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:31,948
lye, glycerin,
potassium hydroxide...

549
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,017
I.e., soap. We even found trace
amounts of it in Lewis' mouth.

550
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:37,186
Soap?
Soap bashing.

551
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:41,023
A hazing technique
the military has long condemned.

552
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:44,026
Except soap didn't break
the boy's parietal bone.

553
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:45,661
The cause of death was
a sharp blow

554
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:47,430
to the back of the head,
and I'm still trying

555
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:49,398
to figure out
exactly what was used.

556
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,100
Hazing gone too far?

557
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:53,803
If so, JAG Noah may have been
investigating

558
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:56,505
Terrence Lewis as a victim,
not a juvie.

559
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:58,474
Somehow figured out
where the body had been dumped,

560
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:00,476
went to Lake Verret
to investigate,

561
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:02,445
and then got shot
by whoever killed Lewis.

562
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:05,948
Well, I hate to say it,
but if more than one cadet

563
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,618
really did haze Lewis,
then it's hard to believe

564
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,653
they're not responsible
for both murders.

565
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:12,688
We're not gonna jump
to conclusions here, okay?

566
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,123
(phone beeping)
We need to be sure.

567
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:18,260
Okay, Loretta,
I need to know what <i>exactly</i>

568
00:24:18,262 --> 00:24:20,062
was used to kill Terrence Lewis.

569
00:24:20,064 --> 00:24:21,130
On it.

570
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:22,198
PRIDE:
Sebastian,

571
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,299
get an ID on those bullets

572
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:24,333
that killed JAG Noah.

573
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,601
I want to know
what type of weapon

574
00:24:25,603 --> 00:24:26,769
they came from ASAP.

575
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,571
Copy that.
Where you going?

576
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:29,739
Rita just texted.

577
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:31,140
I need to try
and slow her down.

578
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:33,509
Send her up as soon
as she gets here.

579
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:39,515
Max Cabral,
assault with a deadly weapon.

580
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:41,550
William Cole,
aggravated assault.

581
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:43,753
Jamal Povey, attempted rape.
Rita...

582
00:24:43,755 --> 00:24:46,689
Tyler Wilson, armed robbery.
And the list goes on.

583
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:48,991
I unsealed every cadet's
criminal record

584
00:24:48,993 --> 00:24:50,526
after I heard about
what happened.

585
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:52,361
I know Noah believed
in these boys, Dwayne.

586
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:53,796
I know you probably do, too.

587
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:55,297
But you can't tell me

588
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,967
none of them are
capable of murder.

589
00:24:57,969 --> 00:24:59,735
You can't prejudge them
from their past.

590
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:02,138
That's not fair.
That's what reform's all about.

591
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,906
This isn't about
reform anymore.

592
00:25:03,908 --> 00:25:05,241
This is about justice.

593
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:06,976
I agree, but all
I'm saying is

594
00:25:06,978 --> 00:25:08,611
we don't know enough yet.

595
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:10,646
Well, we know enough to get
a search and arrest warrant

596
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:12,081
for the entire academy,

597
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,116
which is exactly what
I'm going to do.

598
00:25:14,118 --> 00:25:15,451
And what if you're wrong,

599
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:16,786
like you were yesterday,

600
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:19,255
when you thought that
Lewis killed Noah?

601
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:21,490
Bring all those warrants,
media follows,

602
00:25:21,492 --> 00:25:23,626
makes this headline news,

603
00:25:23,628 --> 00:25:25,094
and Fort MacArthur
gets shut down.

604
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:27,229
Is that what you want?
No! I want justice,

605
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:29,398
and you should
want that, too.

606
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,734
They're boys.
They're suspects!

607
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:38,908
Look, I know everybody
in this town loves you, Dwayne.

608
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,944
They always have because
you always put them first.

609
00:25:41,946 --> 00:25:43,012
Believe me, I know.

610
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:44,113
This isn't about us, Rita.

611
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:46,148
I know how you grew up.

612
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,817
I know how you want
to give everyone,

613
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,486
especially the underdogs,
the benefit of the doubt,

614
00:25:50,488 --> 00:25:53,723
but sometimes they
don't deserve it.

615
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:56,225
We don't know enough yet.

616
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:59,295
There's too much risk to those
boys and to the academy.

617
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:01,297
So, Rita, please...

618
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,032
I disagree.

619
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:05,000
JAG Noah may be
your jurisdiction,

620
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:06,702
but Terrence Lewis is mine.

621
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:09,205
I'm getting the arrest warrants.

622
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,613
DRILL SERGEANT:
Hut!

623
00:26:17,615 --> 00:26:20,216
(sighs)
I don't believe this.

624
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:21,917
Hazing? Murder?

625
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,552
WALSH: If any of this is true,
I've lost total control

626
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:25,187
of this school.

627
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:26,989
How certain are you of this?

628
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:28,491
The bullets that killed Noah
could have come

629
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:30,192
from one of
the academy's rifles,

630
00:26:30,194 --> 00:26:31,794
so we need to find out
what is true

631
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:34,530
if we have any hopes
of containing the situation.

632
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:35,831
And to do that, we need to

633
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,067
test your cadets'
rifles for matches,

634
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,002
and know which students
were off-campus or on leave

635
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:41,437
during both murders.

636
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:45,040
I'll get the logs.

637
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:49,445
(gunshots)
Clear!

638
00:26:53,351 --> 00:26:55,918
Thank you guys
for your cooperation.

639
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,386
Didn't know how
you would act

640
00:26:57,388 --> 00:26:59,822
after finding out
what happened to JAG Noah.

641
00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:00,923
He'd be the first
to counsel calm

642
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,224
and tell us to follow orders,

643
00:27:02,226 --> 00:27:03,359
and that's what I'm doing.

644
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:04,727
Okay, whose rifle's
up next?

645
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:06,595
Commander Cabral's.
Let's have it.

646
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:19,375
(gunshots) I still don't understand, why
are they checking our guns?

647
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:20,676
I don't know.

648
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:24,013
Commander Cabral.
At ease.

649
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:25,481
General Walsh needs
to see you, Commander.

650
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:27,149
It's about Private Lewis.

651
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:33,122
<i>Fide, Honorem, Victoria.</i>

652
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:38,294
Yes, sir.

653
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:44,033
Prep the squad for Code 18.

654
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:45,768
But...
Just do it!

655
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,237
(gunshots)

656
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:51,173
Christopher?
What is it?

657
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:54,210
I don't know, but I don't have
a good feeling about this.

658
00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:56,645
Something's definitely up
over there.

659
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:11,760
One ID shows off premises
at the time of both murders.

660
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:14,096
Dog tag 2476.

661
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:15,364
PRIDE: 247...

662
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:17,733
Lieutenant Commander
Max Cabral.

663
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:18,506
Max?

664
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,203
Yeah, well, his rifle just
matched the bullets

665
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:21,437
that killed JAG Noah.

666
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,671
(alarm blaring)
What's that?

667
00:28:22,673 --> 00:28:24,440
It's a lockdown.

668
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:26,075
But I didn't order it.

669
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:31,447
Whoa!
What the hell is going on?

670
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:34,516
I'm protecting the academy.
Hands up!

671
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,906
(sirens wailing)

672
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:57,116
(alarm blaring)

673
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,519
Let's go, come on.

674
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,421
Down here.
Come on, let's go.

675
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:04,656
Stop looking back.

676
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,192
Keep going, come on!

677
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:12,064
You don't know what
you're doing, son.

678
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,298
You're not thinking straight.

679
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,733
What is this supposed to...
Sit down!

680
00:29:14,735 --> 00:29:16,502
Sit down!

681
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:19,972
CABRAL:
Pull their weapons.

682
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:22,274
(alarm buzzer continues)

683
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:26,478
(cell phone ringing)

684
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:31,116
You should answer that.
Talk to him.

685
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:32,351
No, don't.

686
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,586
Don't.

687
00:29:34,588 --> 00:29:35,988
We're under strict orders.

688
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,524
Orders?
Orders from who?

689
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:43,028
Stand watch.

690
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,080
Go! Go! Go!
(indistinct shouting)

691
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:52,538
No answer?
No. It's weird.

692
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,872
Pride.
Anything?

693
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:55,941
NOPD and LSP are
evacuating the students.

694
00:29:55,943 --> 00:29:57,209
SWAT's taking position.

695
00:29:57,211 --> 00:29:59,211
Geez-- Dorsey!

696
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:00,345
Why is SWAT here?

697
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:02,181
Rita.

698
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:03,849
She called them. It's procedure
when serving felony warrants,

699
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:05,951
and in this case,
it's obviously warranted.

700
00:30:05,953 --> 00:30:07,753
Where the hell
are Christopher and Sonja?

701
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:08,987
NOPD saw a squad of them
take them

702
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:10,623
into the mess hall at gunpoint.

703
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:11,149
What?

704
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:12,559
Students were
blocking the windows.

705
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,426
No one's answering.
Things are getting

706
00:30:14,428 --> 00:30:16,395
out of hand here, General. Fast.

707
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,830
Dorsey!

708
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:19,798
Sir.

709
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,601
You just spoke to Commander
Cabral, what did he say?

710
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:23,936
Well, he didn't say anything.
I just told him

711
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:25,204
you wanted to talk to him
about Lewis,

712
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:26,872
then he triggered a lockdown.

713
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:27,906
You don't think Cabral

714
00:30:27,908 --> 00:30:29,241
had anything to do
with this, do you?

715
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:31,176
No, no, no. Hold on.
All we know right now

716
00:30:31,178 --> 00:30:34,479
is that the bullets
match Cabral's rifle.

717
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:35,581
That's it.
SEBASTIAN: Right.

718
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,015
Why would he hand us
over his rifle

719
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:39,451
when we asked for it,
without even hesitating,

720
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:40,445
if he knew it was gonna
match the murder weapon?

721
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:41,221
GREGORIO: He wouldn't have

722
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:43,422
let you test it.
Get ahold of Loretta.

723
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,257
Okay, let's hope
she's got some answers.

724
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:46,792
We're missing something here.

725
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:48,360
I'm still trying
to establish communication

726
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:50,529
and waiting on drones, stand by.

727
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:52,865
A.D.A. Devereaux.
What's going on? What happened?

728
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,333
The cadets have locked down
the school.

729
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:55,868
Wait, because of the warrants?

730
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,336
We never got a chance
to serve them.

731
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:58,871
Now, they're ensconced,
heavily armed

732
00:30:58,873 --> 00:30:59,905
and they've got hostages.

733
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:01,840
How long till HRT gets here?

734
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:03,575
(sighs)
15 to 20 minutes,

735
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:06,945
but based on the situation,
we may not have that long.

736
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:08,881
I want scopes in every window
and access...

737
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:10,482
Okay, look, I don't want
this blowing up on us.

738
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:13,018
We need to find out
what they want first.

739
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,953
It's not up to me, it's up
to them, but the fact is,

740
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:16,688
is they've taken hostages.

741
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,956
Hey, they'll listen to me.

742
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,858
Let me go in,
talk to Commander Cabral.

743
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,994
I'm his commanding officer,
he'll do whatever I say.

744
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:24,129
It may be the only
way to save them.

745
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:37,175
WADE: The lethal blow
to the head on Terrence Lewis

746
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:39,011
was administered
after the hazing.

747
00:31:39,013 --> 00:31:40,045
How long after?

748
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:41,780
12, 15 hours.

749
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:43,048
So, it's not due to the hazing?

750
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,950
Unless Lewis threatened
to tell somebody

751
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:46,485
after the fact,
and got killed later.

752
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,886
Yeah, there's still
not enough there

753
00:31:47,888 --> 00:31:49,855
to let Commander Cabral
off the hook.

754
00:31:49,857 --> 00:31:51,723
Any idea
what the murder weapon was?

755
00:31:51,725 --> 00:31:54,793
No, but I did find
some curious details.

756
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:56,228
I found a sliver of wood

757
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,764
in the boy's skull,
not just any wood,

758
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:00,432
but 200-year-old cedar.

759
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:04,036
Also, trace amounts of sulfur,
charcoal, saltpeter.

760
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:05,904
That sounds
like black gunpowder.

761
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:08,507
Black gunpowder, you mean,
like from the Civil War?

762
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,542
WALSH:
Yeah.

763
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:12,744
Pride, what is it?

764
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:14,479
Sebastian,

765
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:18,116
if somebody swung one
of these old rifles hard enough,

766
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:20,285
could trace amounts
of black gunpowder...

767
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:21,520
Get dislodged,
and end up embedded

768
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,188
in the skull? Absolutely.

769
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:27,259
Any idea where the missing
rifle is, General?

770
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:29,194
I never even noticed
it was gone.

771
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:31,496
Who else has access
to the office?

772
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:32,798
Captain Dorsey.

773
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,032
Where is Dorsey?

774
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:40,072
CABRAL:
This is not a negotiation.

775
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:42,407
We don't have a choice,
Lieutenant.

776
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:44,309
All I'm saying is maybe
we should listen to them.

777
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:45,544
We didn't do anything wrong.

778
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,312
Lewis is dead because of us!

779
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:49,314
We were ordered to haze him,

780
00:32:49,316 --> 00:32:51,917
just like we were ordered
to do this.

781
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,086
We didn't kill Lewis any more
than we killed JAG Noah.

782
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:56,455
You think anyone outside
of here cares about that?

783
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:58,190
Everything this place
stands for is on the line.

784
00:32:58,192 --> 00:32:59,524
Do you understand?

785
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:01,960
We follow orders. Period.

786
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:04,496
But following orders
is what got us into this mess

787
00:33:04,498 --> 00:33:06,164
in the first place.

788
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,737
PRIDE:
Rita!

789
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:15,474
I'm sorry to say this, Dwayne,
but I think this proves

790
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:17,009
I was right
about the cadets.

791
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:18,844
Actually, I think
they're being set up.

792
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:21,113
I don't think any of
the cadets killed Lewis or Noah.

793
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:24,182
Based on what?
Have you seen Captain Dorsey?

794
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:26,051
Dorsey, we just sent him
inside. Why?

795
00:33:28,355 --> 00:33:30,222
(door closes)

796
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:38,597
Stand down.

797
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:46,371
You were supposed to contain
the situation, Cadet.

798
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:49,107
Now I have to clean it up.

799
00:33:50,477 --> 00:33:51,810
With me.

800
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:08,361
(urgent chatter, guns clicking)

801
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:11,998
All I'm saying is, the situation
may not be as it appears.

802
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,166
We think Commander Cabral's

803
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,735
being set up by the man
you just let inside.

804
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:17,537
Cabral is holding two
of your own people hostage.

805
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:19,439
He's just following orders.

806
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:21,541
And so am I. My job is clear,
Agent Pride,

807
00:34:21,543 --> 00:34:23,810
and that's to defuse
the situation any way I can.

808
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,812
MAN (over radio): Dugan?
Excuse me.

809
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,313
RITA: This doesn't
make any sense.

810
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,681
If you're right,
and the boys are innocent,

811
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:31,284
why do this?
Why take hostages?

812
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,519
The whole premise of reform here
is to teach cadets

813
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:34,887
to obey orders without question,

814
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,023
to put the academy first.

815
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:39,459
Obviously, Dorsey
took advantage of that.

816
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:42,395
Wait, you're saying Dorsey
killed Noah and, and Lewis? Why?

817
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:44,631
SEBASTIAN: Pride.
Talk to me.

818
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:47,066
The general got me access to
Dorsey's personnel files.

819
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,102
Apparently, he applied
to take over the academy

820
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:51,904
after the last general died,
but Walsh got it instead.

821
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,806
That's not motivation for murder.
Well, no.

822
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:55,942
But the main reason that
he got passed over might be.

823
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:57,377
See, Dorsey had been
reprimanded several times

824
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,678
for abuse of authority,

825
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,880
including ordering
the hazing of cadets.

826
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,516
So things with Lewis
went too far,

827
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,252
they got out of hand,
JAG Noah figured it out...

828
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,420
And he had to kill him, too.

829
00:35:07,422 --> 00:35:08,788
Still doesn't explain why Cabral

830
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,290
locked down the school.

831
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:11,991
No, it does.

832
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:14,694
It does, if he's following
Dorsey's orders.

833
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:18,331
And if Dorsey's trying
to make Max look guilty...

834
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:21,634
Where's Gregorio?

835
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,570
PRIDE:
We only got one shot at this.

836
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:28,174
Got it, Pride.
I just hope we have enough time.

837
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:31,678
Hey. If you're innocent,

838
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,480
if Max is innocent,
we can prove it,

839
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:36,382
But not like this.

840
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,785
Besides, even the military's
not supposed to follow orders

841
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:40,253
if they're illegal,

842
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:42,722
or criminal...
hey, and neither are you.

843
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,457
Look, if you want
to do what's right?

844
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:45,892
What is wrong with you?

845
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,328
We can stop this
before it's too late.

846
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,330
You can stop this.

847
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:52,732
But please,

848
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,934
let us go.

849
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:02,175
You are an embarrassment
to the uniform.

850
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:03,943
This is your mess, Commander.

851
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,244
I was following your orders.

852
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,280
My orders were to protect
the academy,

853
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:08,815
not to put it at risk,

854
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:10,583
which is exactly
what you've done.

855
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,972
What the hell were you thinking?

856
00:36:11,996 --> 00:36:13,220
You're the one
that started this.

857
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:15,588
You're the one that told me to
haze Lewis, scare him straight.

858
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,423
But you went too far,
didn't you?

859
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,991
Lewis threatened
to expose it,

860
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:20,927
but that would've brought down
the very institution

861
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,095
that's kept you
from spending the rest

862
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,763
of your sorry-ass life
in prison.

863
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,098
I didn't kill Lewis!

864
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,499
But I had to!

865
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:28,000
To protect
the academy

866
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:29,669
from the same mess.

867
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:31,671
What about JAG Noah?

868
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:33,773
Also on you.

869
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,275
After he figured out
what happened,

870
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,977
tracked down Lewis's body,

871
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:41,481
I had to do something to protect
us all from your screwups!

872
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:43,349
Loyalty above all else!

873
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,019
Remember that?

874
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:49,021
That's what
this place stands for.

875
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:51,624
But that's something
you obviously don't get.

876
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,992
You're a failure,
Cabral,

877
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:55,294
a failure to yourself,
and this institution.

878
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,897
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

879
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,300
Do I have permission to fire?

880
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,869
You think you got the balls?

881
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:05,705
Go ahead, pull the trigger!
Shoot me!

882
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:08,007
No, but I do. Move.

883
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,446
Do it!

884
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:23,322
Federal agents! Don't move!

885
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,358
Put your hands up!

886
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,470
All clear, all clear.

887
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:39,105
Nice shot, Gregorio.

888
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:40,506
I knew you could do it.

889
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,741
See you when you get
back down here.

890
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:42,708
Copy that.

891
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,076
Just out of curiosity,

892
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:45,244
how'd you know
that would work?

893
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:46,712
That that was Dorsey's plan?

894
00:37:46,714 --> 00:37:48,781
I didn't,
but I couldn't figure out

895
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:50,383
what else he was gonna do.

896
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:53,486
Backed in the corner,
knew we were onto him,

897
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:55,121
assumed things would escalate.

898
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:57,723
So, in other words,
it was just a hunch?

899
00:37:57,725 --> 00:38:00,426
I prefer “educated guess.”

900
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:04,063
(exhales)

901
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:06,065
(chuckles)

902
00:38:10,572 --> 00:38:12,738
(piano playing)

903
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:18,144
GREGORIO: Still can't quite
figure him out.

904
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:20,646
Figure out who? Pride?

905
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:22,281
Yeah.
What's there to figure out?

906
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:23,483
He's the man.

907
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:25,284
I think she's talking
about his personal life.

908
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:26,652
Oh.

909
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:28,221
Yeah, but playing piano
is his personal life.

910
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,922
Nah, there's got to be
more to it than that.

911
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:31,524
He's such a good catch.

912
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:35,628
I mean, he should be hooked
up with someone, no?

913
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:41,801
Talking professional curiosity
here, let's just be clear.

914
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,970
Look, King is not in a hurry
to get together

915
00:38:43,972 --> 00:38:45,404
with anyone anytime soon.

916
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,840
SONJA: Yeah.
He's just happy being King.

917
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:49,775
SONJA: It's true.
Okay. Well, like I said,

918
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:52,478
he's a great catch, and
it's just not natural.

919
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,881
You're just cranky that you lost
the bet about Rita.

920
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:57,483
- Bingo. - Exactly! I forgot.
- I'm cranky? I'm cranky?

921
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:00,253
Yeah, you cranky.
Then why is she here?

922
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,787
GREGORIO:
Huh?

923
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:10,763
I see I made
an impression on you.

924
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,865
Oh, yeah? How's that?

925
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,301
Lighter touch on the keys,
less tense.

926
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:17,069
All right,
you're pretty confident.

927
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:18,604
(chuckles)
Uh, not so much.

928
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,274
Certainly not after
I nearly caused a disaster.

929
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,708
You're being too hard
on yourself.

930
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,677
Eh. What else is new?

931
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:26,512
I should've known better.

932
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,914
I should've remembered.

933
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:30,116
Never go up against
one of your hunches.

934
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,486
Oh, I don't know, my way
could've gone sideways, too.

935
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,555
Troubled history
those kids had even before

936
00:39:35,557 --> 00:39:37,290
they get to the academy,
hard not to think

937
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,825
that where there's smoke,
there's fire.

938
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:41,894
Well, certainly
what Captain Dorsey was hoping

939
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:43,729
to make everybody believe.

940
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:45,831
D.A. thinks he wasn't
just trying to frame Max,

941
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:48,634
but also make Walsh look
bad so he could take over.

942
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,404
Almost brought down
the academy instead.

943
00:39:51,406 --> 00:39:53,806
Thanks for putting in
a good word on their behalf.

944
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,609
Oh, it's the least I could do.

945
00:39:56,611 --> 00:40:00,947
After all, those boys
deserve a second chance.

946
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:02,682
Yeah, I agree with that.

947
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:04,850
(playing piano)

948
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,519
Yeah, go ahead.

949
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:08,621
By the way...

950
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,590
(begins playing
“It Had to Be You”)

951
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,158
Remember this one?

952
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,061
No-- don't.
Please, don't go there.

953
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:16,829
