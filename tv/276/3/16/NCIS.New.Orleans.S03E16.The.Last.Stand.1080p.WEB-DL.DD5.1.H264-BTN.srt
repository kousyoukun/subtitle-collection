       but never showed.

117

00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,367

   we're talking about here.

134
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,603

135
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:42,374
         I admit there's nothing
         much to go on here yet,

136
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,842
                  but I've known
               Rita a long time.

137
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,944
  She's not one to panic easily.

138
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,012
                She's concerned.

139
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,513

143
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,688
     was there was nothing
        on his computer.

144
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,490
            Nothing?
    Like it had been erased?

145
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,360
  Yeah. I want you and Patton
         to work on it.

146
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,362
  Maybe see if you can restore
        what was on it.

147
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,030

deep dive Noah.

149

phone records,

150

152
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,407
his last known whereabouts.

153
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,575
          You got it.

154
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:17,609
         What can I do?

155
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,877
You and I

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,545
are going
to Belle Chasse.
                          Okay.

157
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,449
See if we can figure out which,
    if any, of Noah's cases

158
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,718
      have something to do
    with his disappearance.

159
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,954
       Classified cases--
       do we have access?

160
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,622
          Yeah, we do,
  and Rita will meet us there

161
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,391
  to help us sort things out.

162
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,558
Okay, then.

163
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,628
Look forward to meeting
this<i> Rita.</i>

164
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,801
             Don't get me wrong.

165
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,636
        If there's anything I've
       learned since I got here,

166
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,538
          is you have a definite
               nose for justice.

167
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,708
It's just, you know, unusual way
     of taking the case, is all.

168
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,410
What are you trying
to get at, Gregorio?

169
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,078
                    No, nothing.
                I'm just saying,

170
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,745
         we usually start things
       off with an actual crime.

171
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,148
             Phone call, a body.

172
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,418
      But here, banking a lot on
      this Rita friend of yours.

173
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,986
   You must have good reason
    to trust her instincts.

174
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:01,987
     I do.

175
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:02,854
                      Oh.

176
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,424
    Keep fishing, New York.

177
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,461
             RITA:
 Thanks for doing this, Dwayne.

178
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,496
      No thanks necessary.

179
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,165
 Special Agent Tammy Gregorio,

180
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,801
  Assistant District Attorney,
    Reserve Naval Commander,

181
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,470
JAG Corps Rita Devereaux.

182
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:19,871
          Lot of titles, I know.

183
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,206
           You can call me Rita.

184
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,674
    Nice to meet you, Rita.

185
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,910
D.A. get us any access?

186
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,879
        Had to go back on active
        duty to get it, but yes.

187
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,714
Glad the uniform still fits.
It's been a while.

188
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,082
             No, you look great.

189
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,451
Thank you.
                           Yeah.

190
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,486
         Ladies? Yeah.

191
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:37,088
   We find anything in Noah's
  case files that might help?

192
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,592
No, nothing yet, unfortunately.

193
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,594
           I've gone through all
       his current JAG caseload,

194
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,996
         but although sensitive,

195
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,998
              nothing stands out
                  as suspicious.

196
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,934
What about his computer?
Has that been erased, too?

197
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,602
   No, it seems to be intact.

198
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,838
         His last entry
    was calendaring the meet

199
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,940
   he wanted to have with me
       tomorrow morning.

200
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,042
      Home computer wiped,
          office not?

201
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,710
   If Noah's really missing,

202
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,946
  could be more of a personal
     nature than business.

203
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,547
       Gregorio's right.

204
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,648
If there aren't any leads here,

205
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,484
         but there were
      at his apartment...

206
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,219
    Look, you knew him well.

207
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,254
         What did he do
    with his personal time?

208
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,922
 We really haven't had a chance
          to catch up

209
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,757
    since I moved back here
      a couple months ago.

210
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,526
 Oh, you lived in New Orleans?

211
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,794
  Long time ago, way, way back

212
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,662
when I first met Dwayne.

213
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,799
Looks like Noah was pretty
involved with Fort MacArthur.

214
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,167
                       GREGORIO:
          What's Fort MacArthur?

215
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,236
    Private military academy
       outside the city.

216
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:27,539
Town has a long-standing history
with the school.

217
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,808
    Takes in troubled juvies
     with criminal records.

218
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,043
    Place is their last shot
 at turning their lives around.

219
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,645
              RITA: Just like it
                   did for Noah.

220
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,113
      Academy offered him
    structure and direction.

221
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,615
  It's why he joined the Navy.

222
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,650
       And why he's been
 volunteering there ever since.

223
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,785
          He likes to give back.

224
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,554
   A lot like you, actually.

225
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,525
GREGORIO:
Looks like your friend

226
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,727
         was doing more
       than volunteering.

227
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,629
   Student files, log books,

228
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,130
                 leave requests,

229
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,532
           blueprints
    of the school's ground.

230
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,633
  I mean, it almost feels like
         (phone rings)

231
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,835
      he was investigating
        something there.

232
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,838
                  I wonder what.

233
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,707
What you got, Sebastian?

234
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,975
Okay.

235
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,243
We're on our way.
Uh, tell Christopher

236
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,279
     we'll meet them there.

237
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,215
        Noah's computer
      was erased remotely,

238
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:14,085
  but they were able to trace
 the IP address to his laptop.

239
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,987
     Call me. Good or bad.

240
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,289
            Promise.

241
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,804
         Noah Sandler's vehicle.

242
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,774
  Judging by the tire tracks,
     it sat here overnight.

243
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,776
               Any sign of Noah?
              Not yet.

244
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,945
   Any idea what he was doing
     all the way out here?

245
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,313
    Well, it could have been
          gator hunt.

246
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,115
                   Got the gear.

247
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,916
        It's a popular spot, but
        you got to have courage.

248
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,618
Meaning?

249
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,753
     (sighs) Lake Verret's
 not the safest place to hunt.

250
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,854
              PRIDE: It's pretty
           remote and dangerous.

251
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,190
         Nobody usually
     comes out here alone.

252
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,193
       Found the laptop,
but it's been wiped clean, too.

253
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,446
  And according to Sebastian,

254
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,698
 it was used to remotely erase
  Noah's home computer first.

255
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,667
Noah didn't come all the way
out here to erase computers.

256
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,170
                   King.

257
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,821
                      Whoa.

258
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,624
           (growling)

259
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,227
Hyah. Get back.
Hyah.

260
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,162
           (growling)
Hyah. Get back.

261
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,998
           Get back.

262
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,799
                     Hyah. Yeah.

263
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:37,869
                        (hisses)
                       Get back.

264
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,404
Hyah.

265
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:45,210
      It's probably Noah.

266
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,682
Looks like he's been shot twice.

267
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:54,085
Which means our missing persons
case just turned into a murder.

268
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,069
                      SEBASTIAN:
     Hey, Doc Wade call you yet?

269
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,587
No, why?

270
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,104
           She just finished her
     prelim autopsy on JAG Noah.

271
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,173
       Turns out you were right.

272
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,675
 He was shot twice in the back.

273
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,209
       Hunting accident?

274
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,778
       I don't think so.
    It was a tight pattern,

275
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,945
         and both went
    right through the heart.

276
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,814
          Kill shots.

277
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,116
          Question is,
    who killed him and why?

278
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,118
 Looked like he drove out there
          by himself.

279
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,820
     Someone lying in wait,

280
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,889
     hoping to make it look
    like a hunting accident?

281
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,691
     Yeah, how'd they know
    he'd even be out there?

282
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,825
     And why was he there?

283
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,260
    Calls your friend Rita,

284
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,829
    says he wants to discuss
   a sensitive case with her.

285
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,297
  Well, it had to be connected
        to whatever case

286
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,899
he wanted to talk to her about,
             right?

287
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,434
 And told her it was important.

288
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,336
 Thing is, if Rita hadn't come
      to me when she did,

289
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,372
probably never would have found
          Noah's body.

290
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,140
  Gators would have made sure
            of that.

291
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,109
  Was probably what the killer
        was hoping for.

292
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,011
  You and Patton have any luck
          figuring out

293
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,113
  what was on Noah's computers
    before they got erased?

294
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,449
 Nada. We even hacked into the
cloud to check the data stream.

295
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:58,917
   Which means whoever it was

296
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,285
          went through
    an awful lot of trouble

297
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,921
          to cover up
 whatever Noah was working on.

298
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:03,955
             RITA:
           Any word?

299
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,130
You said you would call.

300
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,165
   I know. But we just got back,

301
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:18,069
                        and I...
      I wanted to be sure first.

302
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,071
Sure of what?

303
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,006
                Good or bad, you
                 wanted to know.

304
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,775
                  It's not good.

305
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,777
    Noah was murdered, Rita.

306
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,378
                    He was shot.

307
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,248
             What?

308
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,850
How? Who?

309
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,118
         I don't know.

310
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,121
        We just started
       the investigation.

311
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,823
                I assume that...

312
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,026
       that you've kept looking.

313
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,462
       Any idea what Noah wanted
       to talk to you about yet?

314
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,264
          What was so important?

315
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,034
I, uh...

316
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:54,205
I think it had something to do
with Terrence Lewis.

317
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,507
He's one of the cadets

318
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,776
that Noah was mentoring
at the academy.

319
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,211
I started looking more

320
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,181
into Noah's Fort MacArthur
connections after you left.

321
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,116
               What's so special
                    about Lewis?

322
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,018
Uh, Noah had requested

323
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,220
the boy's
juvenile criminal file,

324
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,289
but JAGs can't access
a minor's record

325
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,792
without a court order.

326
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,294
            But A.D.A.s can, and
       you're thinking that, uh,

327
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,097
   he called you, hoping you
    could get him the files?

328
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,565
Troubled kid, Terrence Lewis.

329
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,867
Assault, armed robbery,

330
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,370
and it doesn't look like he got
reformed at the academy, either.

331
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,805
Kept getting into trouble,

332
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,439
both in and out
of Fort MacArthur.

333
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:32,243
If Terrence Lewis knew
Noah was investigating him...

334
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,145
            He might have killed
             him so he couldn't?

335
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,114
               That's a stretch.

336
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,448
        I'm just looking
     at the facts, Dwayne.

337
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,150
        It's what I do.

338
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,587
And I'm sorry, but not every kid
can be reformed.

339
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,989
And Lewis looks like he wasn't.

340
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,259
      Violent background,
       access to weapons,

341
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,529
and then Noah gets shot to death
    before we can even meet?

342
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:55,033
 If that's not probable cause,
     I don't know what is.

343
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,136
       Don't want to rush
       to judgment here.

344
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,039
    Especially when it comes
  to the kids at the academy.

345
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,608
Suspects are suspects,
regardless of age.

346
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,844
               Look, I know that
           Noah was your friend.

347
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,178
    That's got nothing to do
           with this.

348
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,247
             It does when you're
           not thinking straight

349
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,282
  'cause you're loaded for bear.

350
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:14,586
           (exhales)

351
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:20,091
  Might be the first argument
      I ever won with you.

352
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,629
   I got a good team here, Rita.

353
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,932
     They're good at their jobs.

354
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,269
              Let us investigate
                  Terrence Lewis

355
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,570
         and whatever connection

356
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,273
          the academy may or may
           not have had in this,

357
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:39,477
        and I promise we'll find
            out who killed Noah.

358
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,514
             Okay.

359
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,017
   But if you don't, I will.

360
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,233
         (guns firing,
    drill commands shouted)

361
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,178
        (drums playing)

362
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,053
                    Agent Pride?
                  General Walsh.

363
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,489
     Heard a lot about you.
 It's nice to finally meet you.

364
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:25,523
PRIDE:
You, too, General.

365
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,026
      Special Agents Percy
          and Lasalle.

366
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,160
                        Welcome.
Hey, General.

367
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,295
                        Welcome.
Thank you.

368
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,463
        DRILL SERGEANT:
           Atten-hut.

369
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,932
             WALSH:
             <i> So...</i>

370
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,400
        what brings NCIS
       to Fort MacArthur?

371
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,503
          Well, probably best to
             discuss in private.

372
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,204
                  Minors around,

373
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,307
          want to handle this as
        sensitively as possible.

374
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,475
Understood...
and appreciated.

375
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,378
Especially considering where
most of our cadets come from.

376
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,415
             Law tends to assume
           the worst about them.

377
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,419
Uh, General Sklahr, who is that?

378
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:57,255
   PRIDE: He was the man who
practically founded this place.

379
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,456
     You're familiar?

380
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,425
              Hard to grow up in
           this town and not be.

381
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:03,962
            All the good he did,
        troubled kids he helped.

382
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,431
   WALSH: He gave 'em a home,
        a second chance.

383
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,565
General Sklahr
was the father figure

384
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,500
most of these boys
didn't have.

385
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,402
That's large shoes to fill.

386
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,172
  Proud to have been appointed
      to do exactly that.

387
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,075
Although,
easier said than done.

388
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,344
      COMMANDING OFFICER:
             Halt!

389
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,979
            CADETS:
    ♪ The military live... ♪

390
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:27,118
      So, which of my boys
         is in trouble?

391
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,586
                  Well, not sure
                    any are yet.

392
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,188
          That's why we're here.

393
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,724
     Hoping for an assist.

394
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,460
   We'd like to talk with one
of your cadets, Terrence Lewis.

395
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,595
       Well, so would I.

396
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,331
Private Lewis has been UA
for three weeks now.

397
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,134
Wish I could say
that was unusual.

398
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,569
                  LASALLE: Lewis
               go missing often?

399
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,504
Unfortunately, yes.

400
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,342
We take pride here
in reforming boys,

401
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,011
teaching 'em
to obey orders,

402
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,447
how to commit to something
larger than themselves.

403
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,383
But, we're not
always successful

404
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,717
         and I'm afraid
  that includes Private Lewis.

405
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,753
                 You notify NOPD
                 he was missing?

406
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,021
They don't
have the manpower

407
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,356
 to chase down runaways and...

408
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,059
       juvies like Lewis
    aren't a high priority.

409
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,427
        What's he done?

410
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,430
  Again, not sure, but, uh...

411
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,568
       I'm sorry to say,

412
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,338
        JAG Noah Sandler
       has been murdered.

413
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,642
       And Terrence Lewis
    is a person of interest.

414
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,414
            (sighs)
         Noah, my God.

415
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,282
           How, when?

416
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,251
          Last night.

417
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:37,155
    And what we know now is:
 Noah was investigating Lewis.

418
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,790
  And maybe even the academy.

419
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,591
Investigating?

420
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,460
 Noah never said anything to me
            about it

421
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,595
 and he was here all the time.

422
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,465
   He mentored lots of boys,
    not just Private Lewis.

423
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,634
  Is it all right if we speak
with Lewis' commanding officer?

424
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,303
        Of course. Uh...

425
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,573
Dorsey,
come in here, please.

426
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,844
              Sir?

427
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,647
These are NCIS agents,
Captain Dorsey.

428
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,348
They need to speak
to Commander Cabral ASAP.

429
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,484
   Yes, sir. Right this way.

430
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,555
Agent Pride?

431
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:14,358
   This news of Noah's death
  is gonna hit the boys hard.

432
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,828
I'd rather they hear it from me,
 if that's all right with you.

433
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,563
           Yes, sir.

434
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,735
            (sighs)

435
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,573
(door opens)

436
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,441
What do we got,
Loretta?

437
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,578
I'm sorry, that was way too much
          like Pride.

438
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,513
        That was awful.
  God, I got to work on that.

439
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,181
        I'll work on it,
      it's gonna be fine.

440
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,451
Stop trying so hard, Sebastian,
       you're doing fine.

441
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,386
    I know, I know, I know,
          it's just...

442
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:46,124
      still trying to find
my NCIS way, I guess. You know?

443
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,558
                  Maybe I should
                 keep the moped.

444
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,594
    You here for an update?

445
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,429
          I am. Yeah,
 inquiring minds want to know.

446
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,763
      Especially Pride's.

447
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,666
Well, obviously, an intact body
       would have helped,

448
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,669
but from the pattern of the cuts
    and abrasions I've seen,

449
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,272
coupled with the lack
of coagulation,

450
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:05,543
   it appears JAG Noah's body
    was dragged postmortem.

451
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,211
   Because of Tick-Tock Croc?

452
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,648
  It's a<i> Peter Pan</i> reference.

453
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,283
Anyway,

454
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:13,684
   the alligator bite pattern
          didn't match

455
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,921
    the indicated direction
       of the cuts, so...

456
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,624
    So the killer must have
dragged Noah after he shot him,

457
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,159
      closer to the water.

458
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,295
Hoping the alligators
would devour the evidence, yes.

459
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,230
            (sighs)
Doesn't really get us any closer

460
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,733
  to IDing the killer, though.

461
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,401
                Is there any way
                that we can, uh,

462
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,869
           narrow down what type
                of gun was used?

463
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,372
It was definitely
an automatic rifle of some kind.

464
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,240
Based on the...

465
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,409
entry wound,
probably military.

466
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,945
I can't be sure until
you find me the projectiles.

467
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,680
           Yeah, well, good luck
               with that, right?

468
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,683
A high-powered rifle, bullets
went right through the body,

469
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,818
it's probably buried
back in the bayou somewhere.

470
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,854
Mm-hmm. Sounds like
a field trip to me.
                           Yeah.

471
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:52,723
     Wait, do you mean me?

472
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,694
    You-- you want me to go
         back out there

473
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,230
     to deadly gator-world?
           By myself?

474
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,566
        Tick-Tock Croc.

475
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,901
            (sighs)

476
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,837
           All right.

477
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,673
      I'll see you never.

478
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,575
                    (door opens)

479
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:11,776
            DORSEY:
      <i> Platoon, atten-hut!</i>

480
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,277
            Good afternoon, sir.

481
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,745
At ease, Commander.

482
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,681
       Commander Cabral,
     these are NCIS agents.

483
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,716
They need to speak
with you in private.

484
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,385
                 Of course, sir.

485
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,720
         Cole, front and center.

486
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,458
   Your command, Lieutenant.

487
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,260
                       Aye, sir.

488
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,698
        Still can't wrap
         my head around

489
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,833
      how teaching juvies
         to shoot M16s

490
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,668
       helps reform them.

491
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,271
      Well, it's not about that.
 It teaches them responsibility.

492
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,306
             At least this place
            gives them a chance.

493
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,774
           Port arms!

494
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:46,877
  How can I be of assistance?

495
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,746
  I understand Terrence Lewis

496
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,481
       was in your squad,
           Commander?

497
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>Is</i> in my squad.
Yes, sir.

498
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,785
Although, currently,
Private Lewis is...

499
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,821
          UA, I know.
   How well do you know him?

500
00:20:56,823 --> 00:21:00,391
   General Walsh assigned him
 to my squad three months ago.

501
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,493
         Hoped I could
      straighten him out.

502
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,563
                    How so?
  Permission to speak freely?

503
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,865
       We're just looking
          for answers.

504
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,400
     However you can help.

505
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,638
       Private Lewis was
      a difficult recruit.

506
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,673
The academy prides itself

507
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:19,710
  on strength through loyalty,
       following orders.

508
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,779
        Lewis fought it
     every step of the way.

509
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,715
   So I take it you and Lewis
  didn't get along very well.

510
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,351
     Lewis didn't get along
     with anyone very well.

511
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,588
            What about JAG Noah?
JAG...

512
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,424
   He's the best, he's always
       been there for us.

513
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,893
       Lewis, too, but...

514
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,461
         But what, son?

515
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,600
     Just a few weeks ago,
  JAG Noah tried to help Lewis

516
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,502
        with some stuff
     he was going through.

517
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,804
But Lewis got mad.

518
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,606
         Violent, even.

519
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,908
   Hit JAG Noah-- hard, too.

520
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,412
     That's the last anyone
        ever saw of him.

521
00:21:58,718 --> 00:21:59,917
    (device beeping slowly)

522
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,752
          (loud growl)
          What the...?

523
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,795
           (beeping)

524
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,773
       (beeping rapidly)

525
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,876
             Bingo.

526
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,026
             Okay.

527
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,397
       (beeping steadily)

528
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,403
       (beeping rapidly)

529
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:59,844
          Oh, my God!

530
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,560
      Judging by the rate
       of decomposition,

531
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,963
   I'd estimate the boy died
     about three weeks ago.

532
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,898
                      SEBASTIAN:
        Same time Lewis went UA.

533
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,899
        Cause of death?

534
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:22,900
    WADE: Your missing cadet

535
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,602
was obviously beaten.

536
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,504
Even after all this time,
bruises on his face,

537
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,105
arms, and chest
are still evident.

538
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,474
Yeah, more interesting, though,
 is what was used to beat him.

539
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,143
       Yes, we recovered
       the same substance

540
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,712
     found in the epidermis
        of the bruises--

541
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,548
lye, glycerin,
potassium hydroxide...

542
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,651
I.e., soap. We even found trace
 amounts of it in Lewis' mouth.

543
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,787
                       Soap?
         Soap bashing.

544
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:46,590
       A hazing technique
the military has long condemned.

545
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,660
Except soap didn't break
the boy's parietal bone.

546
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,495
The cause of death was
a sharp blow

547
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,063
to the back of the head,
and I'm still trying

548
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,032
to figure out
exactly what was used.

549
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,801
      Hazing gone too far?

550
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:59,503
 If so, JAG Noah may have been
         investigating

551
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:02,173
  Terrence Lewis as a victim,
          not a juvie.

552
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:04,141
      Somehow figured out
where the body had been dumped,

553
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,143
      went to Lake Verret
        to investigate,

554
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,145
       and then got shot
    by whoever killed Lewis.

555
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:11,649
         Well, I hate to say it,
      but if more than one cadet

556
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:14,518
          really did haze Lewis,
       then it's hard to believe

557
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,587
         they're not responsible
               for both murders.

558
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,522
      We're not gonna jump
   to conclusions here, okay?
        (phone beeping)

559
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,857
      We need to be sure.

560
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:23,861
         Okay, Loretta,
  I need to know what<i> exactly</i>

561
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,696
was used to kill Terrence Lewis.

562
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:26,831
             On it.

563
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,832
             PRIDE:
           Sebastian,

564
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:28,933
   get an ID on those bullets

565
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,034
     that killed JAG Noah.

566
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,235
         I want to know
      what type of weapon

567
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:32,636
      they came from ASAP.

568
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,205
           Copy that.
        Where you going?

569
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:35,639
       Rita just texted.

570
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,841
         I need to try
       and slow her down.

571
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:39,009
      Send her up as soon
       as she gets here.

572
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,216
          Max Cabral,
 assault with a deadly weapon.

573
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,218
         William Cole,
      aggravated assault.

574
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,687
  Jamal Povey, attempted rape.
            Rita...

575
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:52,623
    Tyler Wilson, armed robbery.
           And the list goes on.

576
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,758
        I unsealed every cadet's
                 criminal record

577
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,260
             after I heard about
                  what happened.

578
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,028
            I know Noah believed
          in these boys, Dwayne.

579
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,697
    I know you probably do, too.

580
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,031
           But you can't tell me

581
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,667
                none of them are
              capable of murder.

582
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,636
    You can't prejudge them
        from their past.

583
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,872
        That's not fair.
That's what reform's all about.

584
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,607
                This isn't about
                 reform anymore.

585
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:10,941
          This is about justice.

586
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,643
I agree, but all
I'm saying is

587
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:14,578
we don't know enough yet.

588
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,547
     Well, we know enough to get
     a search and arrest warrant

589
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,815
         for the entire academy,

590
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:19,817
           which is exactly what
                I'm going to do.

591
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,118
   And what if you're wrong,

592
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,753
like you were yesterday,

593
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,955
     when you thought that
       Lewis killed Noah?

594
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,191
Bring all those warrants,
media follows,

595
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,560
   makes this headline news,

596
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:30,828
       and Fort MacArthur
        gets shut down.

597
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,997
     Is that what you want?
No! I want justice,

598
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,165
                  and you should
                 want that, too.

599
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,301
         They're boys.
               They're suspects!

600
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:44,642
     Look, I know everybody
in this town loves you, Dwayne.

601
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:47,711
    They always have because
   you always put them first.

602
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:48,779
      Believe me, I know.

603
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:49,880
   This isn't about us, Rita.

604
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,949
         I know how you grew up.

605
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,651
             I know how you want
               to give everyone,

606
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:56,320
       especially the underdogs,
       the benefit of the doubt,

607
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:59,657
              but sometimes they
               don't deserve it.

608
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,992
We don't know enough yet.

609
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:05,062
There's too much risk to those
boys and to the academy.

610
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,064
      So, Rita, please...

611
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,832
          I disagree.

612
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,768
        JAG Noah may be
       your jurisdiction,

613
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,636
  but Terrence Lewis is mine.

614
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,838
I'm getting the arrest warrants.

615
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,614
        DRILL SERGEANT:
              Hut!

616
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,950
            (sighs)
     I don't believe this.

617
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,751
        Hazing? Murder?

618
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,320
  WALSH: If any of this is true,
         I've lost total control

619
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:30,955
                 of this school.

620
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,756
  How certain are you of this?

621
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,258
The bullets that killed Noah
could have come

622
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,026
from one of
the academy's rifles,

623
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,828
     so we need to find out
          what is true

624
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,297
      if we have any hopes
  of containing the situation.

625
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,665
   And to do that, we need to

626
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,867
               test your cadets'
             rifles for matches,

627
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,769
    and know which students
  were off-campus or on leave

628
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,071
      during both murders.

629
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,741
       I'll get the logs.

630
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,145
           (gunshots)
             Clear!

631
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,785
         Thank you guys
     for your cooperation.

632
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,287
        Didn't know how
         you would act

633
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,689
       after finding out
   what happened to JAG Noah.

634
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:06,757
       He'd be the first
        to counsel calm

635
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,058
 and tell us to follow orders,

636
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,226
   and that's what I'm doing.

637
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,794
      Okay, whose rifle's
            up next?

638
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,296
      Commander Cabral's.
Let's have it.

639
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,209
           (gunshots)
 I still don't understand, why
  are they checking our guns?

640
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:26,744
                   I don't know.

641
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,913
       Commander Cabral.
            At ease.

642
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,315
      General Walsh needs
     to see you, Commander.

643
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,850
   It's about Private Lewis.

644
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,822
    <i> Fide, Honorem, Victoria.</i>

645
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,994
                   Yes, sir.

646
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,000
  Prep the squad for Code 18.

647
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,869
         But...
                  Just do it!

648
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,204
           (gunshots)

649
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:57,141
       Christopher?
               What is it?

650
00:27:57,143 --> 00:28:00,177
 I don't know, but I don't have
   a good feeling about this.

651
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,413
   Something's definitely up
          over there.

652
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,861
   One ID shows off premises
  at the time of both murders.

653
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,997
         Dog tag 2476.

654
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,331
         PRIDE: 247...

655
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,767
      Lieutenant Commander
          Max Cabral.

656
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,103
          Max?
   Yeah, well, his rifle just
      matched the bullets

657
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,337
     that killed JAG Noah.

658
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,739
        (alarm blaring)
                    What's that?

659
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,340
It's a lockdown.

660
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:31,842
     But I didn't order it.

661
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,414
             Whoa!
   What the hell is going on?

662
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,284
  I'm protecting the academy.
           Hands up!

663
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,734
        (sirens wailing)

664
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:05,943
        (alarm blaring)

665
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,346
       Let's go, come on.

666
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,181
           Down here.
       Come on, let's go.

667
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,283
              Stop looking back.

668
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,019
      Keep going, come on!

669
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,024
      You don't know what
       you're doing, son.

670
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,259
 You're not thinking straight.

671
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,493
  What is this supposed to...
Sit down!

672
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:25,129
           Sit down!

673
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,899
CABRAL:
Pull their weapons.

674
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,101
    (alarm buzzer continues)

675
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,105
      (cell phone ringing)

676
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:39,877
    You should answer that.
          Talk to him.

677
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,078
           No, don't.

678
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,347
                        Don't.

679
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:44,948
   We're under strict orders.

680
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,151
            Orders?
        Orders from who?

681
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,855
                    Stand watch.

682
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,826
Go! Go! Go!
     (indistinct shouting)

683
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:01,365
                      No answer?
        No. It's weird.

684
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,833
             Pride.
           Anything?

685
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:04,902
        NOPD and LSP are
    evacuating the students.

686
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:05,969
         SWAT's taking position.

687
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,971
         Geez-- Dorsey!

688
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,106
               Why is SWAT here?

689
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,941
             Rita.

690
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,810
She called them. It's procedure
when serving felony warrants,

691
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,978
and in this case,
it's obviously warranted.

692
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,547
         Where the hell
   are Christopher and Sonja?

693
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:17,915
    NOPD saw a squad of them
           take them

694
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,249
into the mess hall at gunpoint.

695
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,385
What?
                   Students were
           blocking the windows.

696
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:23,153
      No one's answering.
              Things are getting

697
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,122
out of hand here, General. Fast.

698
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:26,590
            Dorsey!

699
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:28,592
              Sir.

700
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:31,395
  You just spoke to Commander
    Cabral, what did he say?

701
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:32,963
 Well, he didn't say anything.
        I just told him

702
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:33,964
   you wanted to talk to him
          about Lewis,

703
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,833
 then he triggered a lockdown.

704
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:36,934
          You don't think Cabral

705
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,436
              had anything to do
              with this, do you?

706
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:39,937
No, no, no. Hold on.
All we know right now

707
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:43,307
is that the bullets
match Cabral's rifle.

708
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:44,474
That's it.
SEBASTIAN: Right.

709
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,076
      Why would he hand us
         over his rifle

710
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,378
     when we asked for it,
    without even hesitating,

711
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,080
         if he knew it was gonna
        match the murder weapon?
      GREGORIO: He wouldn't have

712
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,249
let you test it.
     Get ahold of Loretta.

713
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,084
        Okay, let's hope
    she's got some answers.

714
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,853
 We're missing something here.

715
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,154
        I'm still trying
   to establish communication

716
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,356
and waiting on drones, stand by.

717
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,959
A.D.A. Devereaux.
What's going on? What happened?

718
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,160
  The cadets have locked down
          the school.

719
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:04,962
  Wait, because of the warrants?

720
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:06,230
           We never got a chance
                  to serve them.

721
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,898
         Now, they're ensconced,
                   heavily armed

722
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,932
       and they've got hostages.

723
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,901
  How long till HRT gets here?

724
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:12,436
            (sighs)
       15 to 20 minutes,

725
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:16,039
  but based on the situation,
   we may not have that long.

726
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,941
 I want scopes in every window
         and access...

727
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,376
    Okay, look, I don't want
     this blowing up on us.

728
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,045
      We need to find out
     what they want first.

729
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,947
It's not up to me, it's up
to them, but the fact is,

730
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,515
is they've taken hostages.

731
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:26,984
   Hey, they'll listen to me.

732
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:28,919
Let me go in,
talk to Commander Cabral.

733
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:31,088
  I'm his commanding officer,
    he'll do whatever I say.

734
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,023
              It may be the only
               way to save them.

735
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:46,103
     WADE: The lethal blow
 to the head on Terrence Lewis

736
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,071
        was administered
       after the hazing.

737
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,139
        How long after?

738
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,641
         12, 15 hours.

739
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:52,142
So, it's not due to the hazing?

740
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:54,077
    Unless Lewis threatened
        to tell somebody

741
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,379
        after the fact,
     and got killed later.

742
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,014
Yeah, there's still
not enough there

743
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,982
    to let Commander Cabral
         off the hook.

744
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:00,684
            Any idea
  what the murder weapon was?

745
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:03,654
       No, but I did find
     some curious details.

746
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:05,188
    I found a sliver of wood

747
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,624
      in the boy's skull,
       not just any wood,

748
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,393
    but 200-year-old cedar.

749
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:13,196
 Also, trace amounts of sulfur,
      charcoal, saltpeter.

750
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,032
          That sounds
     like black gunpowder.

751
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:17,467
      Black gunpowder, you mean,
        like from the Civil War?

752
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,303
             WALSH:
             Yeah.

753
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:21,638
       Pride, what is it?

754
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,373
           Sebastian,

755
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:27,077
     if somebody swung one
of these old rifles hard enough,

756
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,246
      could trace amounts
     of black gunpowder...

757
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,414
         Get dislodged,
      and end up embedded

758
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,149
   in the skull? Absolutely.

759
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,219
      Any idea where the missing
              rifle is, General?

760
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:38,155
      I never even noticed
          it was gone.

761
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,357
             Who else has access
                  to the office?

762
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,725
        Captain Dorsey.

763
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,060
        Where is Dorsey?

764
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,199
            CABRAL:
   This is not a negotiation.

765
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:51,401
We don't have a choice,
Lieutenant.

766
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,270
    All I'm saying is maybe
   we should listen to them.

767
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:54,471
  We didn't do anything wrong.

768
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,239
    Lewis is dead because of us!

769
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,275
We were ordered to haze him,

770
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:01,111
just like we were ordered
to do this.

771
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:03,080
 We didn't kill Lewis any more
    than we killed JAG Noah.

772
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,415
    You think anyone outside
   of here cares about that?

773
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,117
Everything this place
stands for is on the line.

774
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,452
Do you understand?

775
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:11,188
   We follow orders. Period.

776
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,457
      But following orders
 is what got us into this mess

777
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,192
      in the first place.

778
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,564
             PRIDE:
             Rita!

779
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,434
I'm sorry to say this, Dwayne,
but I think this proves

780
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,236
I was right
about the cadets.

781
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,005
       Actually, I think
     they're being set up.

782
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,107
      I don't think any of
the cadets killed Lewis or Noah.

783
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:33,176
                  Based on what?
Have you seen Captain Dorsey?

784
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,078
    Dorsey, we just sent him
          inside. Why?

785
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:39,249
         (door closes)

786
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,491
          Stand down.

787
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,265
  You were supposed to contain
     the situation, Cadet.

788
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,201
   Now I have to clean it up.

789
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:00,704
            With me.

790
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,057
(urgent chatter, guns clicking)

791
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:23,460
All I'm saying is, the situation
may not be as it appears.

792
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:24,694
We think Commander Cabral's

793
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:27,297
    being set up by the man
      you just let inside.

794
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,232
     Cabral is holding two
  of your own people hostage.

795
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,201
  He's just following orders.

796
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,070
 And so am I. My job is clear,
          Agent Pride,

797
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:35,405
      and that's to defuse
  the situation any way I can.

798
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,441
    MAN (over radio): Dugan?
           Excuse me.

799
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,109
              RITA: This doesn't
                 make any sense.

800
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:40,310
        If you're right,
   and the boys are innocent,

801
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:43,080
          why do this?
       Why take hostages?

802
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,248
The whole premise of reform here
       is to teach cadets

803
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,450
to obey orders without question,

804
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:48,618
   to put the academy first.

805
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,254
       Obviously, Dorsey
    took advantage of that.

806
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,191
   Wait, you're saying Dorsey
killed Noah and, and Lewis? Why?

807
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,226
               SEBASTIAN: Pride.
Talk to me.

808
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,662
    The general got me access to
       Dorsey's personnel files.

809
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,730
     Apparently, he applied
    to take over the academy

810
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,600
  after the last general died,
   but Walsh got it instead.

811
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,402
     That's not motivation
          for murder.
                       Well, no.

812
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,571
    But the main reason that
  he got passed over might be.

813
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,106
      See, Dorsey had been
   reprimanded several times

814
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,307
    for abuse of authority,

815
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:12,509
       including ordering
     the hazing of cadets.

816
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:15,145
      So things with Lewis
         went too far,

817
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:17,814
     they got out of hand,
   JAG Noah figured it out...

818
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,149
  And he had to kill him, too.

819
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,317
Still doesn't explain why Cabral

820
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:21,852
    locked down the school.

821
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:23,587
          No, it does.

822
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:26,323
   It does, if he's following
        Dorsey's orders.

823
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:29,759
     And if Dorsey's trying
   to make Max look guilty...

824
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,263
       Where's Gregorio?

825
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,233
             PRIDE:
 We only got one shot at this.

826
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:39,669
         Got it, Pride.
I just hope we have enough time.

827
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,340
        Hey. If you're innocent,

828
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,309
             if Max is innocent,
                we can prove it,

829
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,211
              But not like this.

830
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,380
Besides, even the military's
not supposed to follow orders

831
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:51,882
if they're illegal,

832
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:54,417
or criminal...
hey, and neither are you.

833
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,253
               Look, if you want
             to do what's right?

834
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:57,554
    What is wrong with you?

835
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:00,157
                We can stop this
           before it's too late.

836
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,925
              You can stop this.

837
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:04,361
But please,

838
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:06,429
           let us go.

839
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,803
    You are an embarrassment
        to the uniform.

840
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,572
 This is your mess, Commander.

841
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,940
  I was following your orders.

842
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:18,909
   My orders were to protect
          the academy,

843
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,443
     not to put it at risk,

844
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,312
which is exactly
what you've done.

845
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,915
What the hell were you thinking?
                  You're the one
              that started this.

846
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:27,284
  You're the one that told me to
 haze Lewis, scare him straight.

847
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,252
     But you went too far,
          didn't you?

848
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:30,620
Lewis threatened
to expose it,

849
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,556
but that would've brought down
the very institution

850
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:33,790
that's kept you
from spending the rest

851
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,458
     of your sorry-ass life
           in prison.

852
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,793
      I didn't kill Lewis!

853
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,195
         But I had to!

854
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,696
To protect
the academy

855
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,364
      from the same mess.

856
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,366
      What about JAG Noah?

857
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,468
          Also on you.

858
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,971
After he figured out
what happened,

859
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:49,706
   tracked down Lewis's body,

860
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,343
I had to do something to protect
   us all from your screwups!

861
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:54,911
Loyalty above all else!

862
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:58,715
         Remember that?

863
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,750
That's what
this place stands for.

864
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,320
      But that's something
    you obviously don't get.

865
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:04,688
You're a failure,
Cabral,

866
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,990
a failure to yourself,
and this institution.

867
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:09,459
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

868
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,996
 Do I have permission to fire?

869
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,564
  You think you got the balls?

870
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,400
Go ahead, pull the trigger!
Shoot me!

871
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,569
             No, but I do. Move.

872
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:25,008
             Do it!

873
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,285
  Federal agents! Don't move!

874
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:36,987
              Put your hands up!

875
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,399
     All clear, all clear.

876
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,834
Nice shot, Gregorio.

877
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,269
I knew you could do it.

878
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,470
See you when you get
back down here.

879
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,471
           Copy that.

880
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:55,872
          Just out of curiosity,

881
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:56,973
                  how'd you know
                that would work?

882
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,475
    That that was Dorsey's plan?

883
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:00,510
I didn't,
but I couldn't figure out

884
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,345
what else he was gonna do.

885
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:05,415
Backed in the corner,
knew we were onto him,

886
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,883
assumed things would escalate.

887
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,552
So, in other words,
it was just a hunch?

888
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:12,055
   I prefer "educated guess."

889
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,825
           (exhales)

890
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,694
           (chuckles)

891
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:24,367
        (piano playing)

892
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:29,906
  GREGORIO: Still can't quite
        figure him out.

893
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,409
     Figure out who? Pride?

894
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:34,044
                    Yeah.
What's there to figure out?

895
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:35,679
                   He's the man.

896
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,313
I think she's talking
about his personal life.

897
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,816
                       Oh.

898
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,317
Yeah, but playing piano
is his personal life.

899
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,751
          Nah, there's got to be
           more to it than that.

900
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,420
         He's such a good catch.

901
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,524
     I mean, he should be hooked
            up with someone, no?

902
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,630
  Talking professional curiosity
      here, let's just be clear.

903
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:55,765
Look, King is not in a hurry
to get together

904
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,467
with anyone anytime soon.

905
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,669
SONJA: Yeah.
He's just happy
being King.

906
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,671
SONJA: It's true.
        Okay. Well, like I said,

907
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,341
         he's a great catch, and
          it's just not natural.

908
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,810
You're just cranky that you lost
      the bet about Rita.

909
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:09,346
Bingo.
          Exactly! I forgot.
         I'm cranky? I'm cranky?

910
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:12,115
Yeah, you cranky.
     Then why is she here?

911
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,483
                       GREGORIO:
                            Huh?

912
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:22,592
I see I made
an impression on you.

913
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,694
           Oh, yeah? How's that?

914
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,364
Lighter touch on the keys,
less tense.

915
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,932
           All right,
    you're pretty confident.

916
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,500
           (chuckles)
        Uh, not so much.

917
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:33,370
      Certainly not after
  I nearly caused a disaster.

918
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:34,504
     You're being too hard
          on yourself.

919
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:36,439
Eh. What else is new?

920
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,541
I should've known better.

921
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,776
         I should've remembered.

922
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,945
             Never go up against
            one of your hunches.

923
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:45,515
Oh, I don't know, my way
could've gone sideways, too.

924
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,384
Troubled history
those kids had even before

925
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,119
they get to the academy,
hard not to think

926
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:51,688
that where there's smoke,
there's fire.

927
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,723
        Well, certainly
 what Captain Dorsey was hoping

928
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,625
   to make everybody believe.

929
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,694
           D.A. thinks he wasn't
       just trying to frame Max,

930
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,463
        but also make Walsh look
      bad so he could take over.

931
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:03,433
Almost brought down
the academy instead.

932
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:05,635
Thanks for putting in
a good word on their behalf.

933
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,471
  Oh, it's the least I could do.

934
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:12,742
     After all, those boys
    deserve a second chance.

935
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,477
    Yeah, I agree with that.

936
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,646
        (playing piano)

937
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,548
        Yeah, go ahead.

938
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,550
         By the way...

939
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,585
        (begins playing
      "It Had to Be You")

940
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,020
       Remember this one?

941
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,890
          No-- don't.
    Please, don't go there.

942
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,725
