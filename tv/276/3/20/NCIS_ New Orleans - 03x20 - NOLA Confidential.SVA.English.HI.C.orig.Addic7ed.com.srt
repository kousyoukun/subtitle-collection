a banana cinnamon pudding

00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,390
in the oven,
which I'm hoping I didn't burn.

(romantic jazz music playing)

Here I thought I was the chef

(chuckles)
You may want to taste

49
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,298
the food before
you relinquish the title.

50
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,201
(chuckles) Well, you know,
you didn't really have to do

51
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,402
all of this.

52
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:03,270
And you don't have
to do that.

53
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:04,605
I got this.

54
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:06,840
Okay.
To be honest,

55
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:08,742
I might have an ulterior motive.

56
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:11,612
There are a couple of things
I wanted to talk to you about.

57
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:13,847
And I was thought
the food and wine might

58
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,549
make it a little easier.

59
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,851
This about Clearwater?

60
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:18,852
Ah!

61
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:20,654
So, few weeks ago...

62
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:23,089
Yeah.
...on the Brossette case,

63
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:25,825
we learned several housing
developments were shelved there.

64
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,860
Police resources were curbed.
Yeah, Mayor Hamilton

65
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:31,064
was behind all of it,
but we never found out why.

66
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,098
Well, I may have.

67
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,233
Someone's been buying

68
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,201
properties in Clearwater
at a huge rate,

69
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:38,037
pushing people out
when they don't want to sell.

70
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,405
And you think
it's Hamilton?

71
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:41,106
Well, it makes sense.

72
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:42,608
Deny services
to the residents,

73
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,644
and then sweep in
and buy their houses.

74
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:47,046
It's a poor immigrant community.

75
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,848
Property values
are rock-bottom.

76
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,783
No profits to be made.

77
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:53,352
I have to figure out
Hamilton's angle.

78
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:54,753
Well, this is a city matter.

79
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:56,221
You're NCIS.

80
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:57,622
No jurisdiction.

81
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,291
Me, on the other hand,

82
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:01,893
go to Clearwater, question
some of the complainants,

83
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,495
figure out who's buying
the property,

84
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,797
try and put a case together
for the D.A.

85
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,499
Hamilton basically got
the D.A. elected.

86
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,734
He's kissing cousins
with half the office.

87
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,604
You'd be putting a target
on your back at work.

88
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,673
That's the second thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

89
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:18,710
Um... I may not be staying
at the D.A.'s office, Dwayne.

90
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:20,545
What?
I got a job offer.

91
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:22,213
Department of Justice.

92
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,116
National Security Division.

93
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:27,585
It's in Washington, D.C.

94
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,255
Wow, that's-that's...

95
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:32,957
that's a big deal.

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,758
Yeah, it is.

97
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,994
They want me ASAP,
and I've been putting them off.

98
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:37,962
Why?

99
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,997
You have to ask?

100
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:43,667
Look, I'm not one to cut
and run, and neither are you.

101
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:46,136
But whatever this is between us,

102
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,472
it deserves a chance,
don't you think?

103
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:51,274
Yes, I do.

104
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:53,310
(phone beeping)

105
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:55,646
Oh, yeah.
I know what that means.

106
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:57,481
No, no. No, not neces...

107
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:59,083
It's Gregorio.

108
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:00,683
We caught a case.

109
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:04,421
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,823
Eh, more bread pudding
for me.

111
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:07,857
(chuckles)

112
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,326
Talk later.

113
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:10,327
Yeah.

114
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,962
You got the dishes.

115
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,097
There are plenty of 'em.

116
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,565
(chuckles)

117
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:17,399
(camera clicking)

118
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:20,069
Victim's name
is Nathan Kelly.

119
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:22,639
A Navy contractor
working the port by day,

120
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:24,107
drug dealing by night.

121
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:26,109
Didn't turn out
too well for him.

122
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,112
Mr. Kelly was shot three times
with a Glock Model 17.

123
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:30,513
Don't you usually
have to get the body

124
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:31,881
back to the morgue
before you know that?

125
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:33,782
This time, we have
the weapon and the shooter.

126
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:35,684
Kelly acted crazy
during the deal.

127
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:37,153
NOPD Vice had to take him out.

128
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:39,087
He was dealing drugs
to an undercover cop?

129
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:41,390
Fentanyl,
according to NOPD.

130
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:45,161
A synthetic opioid 50 times
more powerful than heroin.

131
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:46,495
About a kilo of
it over there.

132
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:48,096
LASALLE:
That's some heavy weight.

133
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:50,231
How does a dock worker
get his hands on it?

134
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,233
We're hoping you could
answer that question.

135
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:53,902
If you Feds can spare

136
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:55,737
some of your precious time.

137
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,340
Special Agent Lasalle.

138
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,976
Hey, always
willing to step in

139
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:02,978
and fix the locals' messes,
Sergeant Spencer.

140
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,479
Hey, he's Lieutenant Spencer,
actually.

141
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:06,181
For real?
Yep.

142
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:07,215
You got promoted again?

143
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:09,184
Always failing upward.

144
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,560
(laughter)

145
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:19,894
LASALLE:
Good to see you.

146
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:21,429
Let me guess, you guys go back.

147
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,197
Spencer.
Gregorio.

149
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,800
Detective Aubrey.

150
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:28,335
We taught LaSalle everything
he knows about being a cop.

151
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:30,671
Yeah, it took an hour,
and I improvise the rest.

152
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:32,406
And then Pride stole him
away from vice.

153
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,075
Forgot about his pals.

154
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:35,943
Haven't seen you
for Tuesday drinks in a while.

155
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:38,112
Ah, my partying
days are curtailed.

156
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:39,379
Busy fighting crime.

157
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,347
Speaking of which,

158
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,549
any idea what Kelly
was into here?

159
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,351
City's been fentanyl-free
for a year.

160
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:47,053
Couple weeks ago, it's back
on the street with a vengeance.

161
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,488
You think Kelly's the supplier?

162
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,090
Nah. Kelly's on the thug end
of the spectrum.

163
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:52,526
But Marino's been working him
for the past couple days.

164
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:53,993
Pretty sure he's got a hookup
down at the ports though.

165
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:55,229
Maybe a Navy connection.

166
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,429
Hoping you guys could
check that out.

167
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:58,031
Where's Marino anyway?

168
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,100
He working another
monster hangover?

169
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:01,167
You didn't hear?

170
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,169
Deal went bad, Chris.

171
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,338
Marino took a bullet.

172
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,911
(siren wailing)

173
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:15,481
(groans softly)

174
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,782
(knocks)

175
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:19,285
Hey. Whoa.

176
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,354
It's my former partner, huh?

177
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:23,088
And the new guy.

178
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,923
Been almost ten years
since Chris joined NCIS.

179
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:27,293
I don't think you can call me
the new guy anymore.

180
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:29,327
I'm the one that
broke him in.

181
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,063
And I'm still
not convinced

182
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:33,265
this whole NCIS thing
isn't just a phase.

183
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,234
You want me to come visit,
you should just call,

184
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:36,835
not get in a shootout.

185
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:38,036
Wasn't much of a shootout.

186
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:39,537
I didn't even get to my weapon.

187
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,007
You're still wearing
your gun on your ankle.

188
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,575
Just like in that movie.

189
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:44,943
<i>French Connection,</i> baby.

190
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,511
Look at that.

191
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:48,313
It's a modern-day classic.

192
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:49,447
I bet you still haven't seen it.

193
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,815
It's on my list.

194
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:55,654
Sure you should be doing that?

195
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:58,122
Celebrating
my miraculous survival.

196
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:00,925
Shot point-blank,
barely a scratch.

197
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:02,226
Looks like more than
a scratch to me.

198
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:03,694
MARINO:
Yeah, well.

199
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:05,963
- You should see the other guy.
- Yeah, we did.

200
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,765
Since he can't talk,
we're hoping you will.

201
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,700
Sure, Dwayne. I don't think
there's much to tell.

202
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:13,437
You think Kelly was getting his
fentanyl in through the port?

203
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,341
Must've. I mean, we shut down
the local operation last year.

204
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:19,242
Took out one of
his big drug labs.

205
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:20,678
Confiscated 50 keys.

206
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,845
That's quite a haul.

207
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:23,447
Yeah, biggest of my career.

208
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,317
Though somehow,
Spencer got all the credit

209
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,884
and the big promotion.

210
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:29,453
Well, you're a team.
Good for him, right?

211
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:31,755
He got the reward,
and I got the bullet.

212
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,324
Uh, that's a fair deal.

213
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:35,091
Well, Kelly must've had
some kind of connection

214
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,260
bringing in the drugs.
Huh?

215
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:39,762
I mean, he was loading
and unloading Navy cargo

216
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:41,597
off ships
from all over the world.

217
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,099
Had special clearance.

218
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:44,367
You think Navy personnel
are smuggling drugs

219
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:45,568
into New Orleans?

220
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,003
(chuckles)

221
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:49,239
I'm just a street cop.

222
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,141
They pay me
to bust down doors.

223
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:53,810
I'll leave it to the, uh,
professional investigators

224
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:55,511
to put the pieces
together.

225
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:57,246
Maybe we can work
together on this.

226
00:07:57,248 --> 00:08:00,049
You lay off the booze
and get some rest.

227
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:01,651
Molly picking you up?

228
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,853
Ooh.

229
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:06,188
I guess it has been
a while, Chris.

230
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,724
Um...

231
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:09,524
Molly left me.

232
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,361
Guess I'm an acquired taste.

233
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:13,795
Sorry to hear that.

234
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:15,164
Mm.

235
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,967
Come on. I'll take you home.

236
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:20,102
All right.

237
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:30,679
Okay. According to NOPD,
Kelly was smuggling fentanyl

238
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,681
off of incoming cargo ships.

239
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:34,549
Problem is, the vessels
he was off-loading

240
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,251
come from
the Southern Hemisphere.

241
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:38,987
Fentanyl's usually manufactured
in China and East Asia.

242
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:41,722
If Kelly was a part
of an international drug ring,

243
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:44,425
there'd be signs
in his digital life--

244
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:46,594
phone calls, e-mails,

245
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,763
activity in the Dark Web--
but there's nothing.

246
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,390
There is one discrepancy.

247
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:51,790
Kelly was loading a ship

248
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,025
that was bound
for the Panama Canal yesterday.

249
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:56,161
A hundred crates
of dry goods for

250
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,429
the USNS <i>Tacoma.</i>

251
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:00,131
He ended up loading 101 crates.

252
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,600
Did a manual correction
in the ship's log.

253
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:04,870
I contacted
the Navy logistics officer.

254
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:07,672
There's no record
of this extra crate.

255
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:09,074
King, what if
Kelly wasn't

256
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:12,143
smuggling drugs
<i>in</i> to New Orleans...

257
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,544
But smuggling them out.

258
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,713
Skimmed a key off the
top to sell on the side,

259
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:17,348
got clipped by the cops.

260
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,517
Still doesn't answer the
question of who supplied him.

261
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,353
Keep digging into Kelly's life;
there's got to be something.

262
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:24,188
Well, I might not be able
to tell you about Kelly's life,

263
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,956
but I can tell you
about the drugs that he had.

264
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,458
See, every batch of
synthetic narcotics

265
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,760
has its own unique
chemical recipe,

266
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:30,294
kind of like DNA.

267
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:32,529
Well, the brick of fentanyl
that was in Kelly's car,

268
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,064
that was manufactured
here in New Orleans.

269
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,665
GREGORIO: From the same drug lab
that vice busted last year.

270
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,968
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, from the same
batch that was confiscated

271
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,836
in that bust.
By all accounts,

272
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:42,172
this should be
in an NOPD evidence locker.

273
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,074
Somehow, Kelly got
possession of the drugs.

274
00:09:44,076 --> 00:09:45,809
GREGORIO:
Well, if that's true,

275
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:47,511
then he definitely couldn't
have done it alone.

276
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:49,880
He had to have help
from inside the NOPD.

277
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,815
Not just NOPD.

278
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,417
The vice squad.

279
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,951
My old unit.

280
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:56,252
I mean, that's what
you're suggesting,

281
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:58,455
isn't it?

282
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:10,921
So we're saying
that someone stole 50 kilos

283
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:12,455
of fentanyl
from the NOPD,

284
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:14,625
gave it to Kelly to smuggle
out of the country.

285
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:15,626
Probably a vice cop.

286
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:17,060
We have no proof of that.

287
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,796
Well, I-I tested
the drugs.

288
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:21,664
They're from the same batch;
that's pretty strong evidence.

289
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,133
Not to me, Sebastian.

290
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:26,002
Not when you're talking about
my old unit being corrupt.

291
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:27,303
SEBASTIAN: I'm just saying
that the drugs match,

292
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:29,439
that's all.
You don't know these guys.

293
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:32,842
After Katrina, my house was
destroyed, Marino took me in.

294
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:34,144
The rest of the unit,

295
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,311
they helped rebuild; every day,

296
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:36,979
after work, they pitched in.

297
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:39,181
All right, guys like that
don't do this!

298
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:40,182
PRIDE:
Christopher.

299
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,418
Let's take this one step
at a time.

300
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,920
Okay, we know that Kelly

301
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:45,421
had the fentanyl,
and it looks like

302
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:47,156
he loaded it onto a cargo ship.

303
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:49,291
Which is currently headed
for the Panama Canal.

304
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:50,626
PRIDE:
Contact the Coast Guard.

305
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,662
Get on that ship.
Find the extra crate.

306
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:53,863
Oh, you know what,
I should go, too.

307
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:55,830
I thought you and boats
don't get along so well.

308
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:57,232
No, I love boats,
it's just the water

309
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:58,300
that makes me want to hurl.

310
00:10:58,302 --> 00:10:59,634
But the point is
you're gonna need me

311
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:00,769
to test the fentanyl.

312
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:02,371
Besides, I'm an
NCIS agent now, right?

313
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:04,206
I got to get my sea
legs at some point.

314
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,941
Take him.

315
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:07,709
Come on.

316
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,011
If you throw up on me,
I'll shoot you.

317
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:11,913
No pressure, though, right?

318
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:17,052
(sighs)

319
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:19,788
Now, I came up with these cops.
They're like family.

320
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,189
You know 'em, too.

321
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:22,857
Now, they seem like
the kind of people

322
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:25,226
who would take a penny
that doesn't belong to 'em?

323
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,828
We're not talking about a penny,
Christopher.

324
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,265
Look, they're good guys, but
we-we got to investigate.

325
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:33,033
This is all kinds
of personal for you,

326
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:35,035
so if it's
too close to home, then...

327
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:36,337
No, I'm good.

328
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,539
Let's go to vice.

329
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,281
GREGORIO:
You gonna be all right?

330
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:50,450
SEBASTIAN: Yeah. That flight was a little
choppier than I would've liked.

331
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:51,785
Think I'm all
out of patches.

332
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,553
All right, well, look,
take one of these.

333
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,554
What is it?

334
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:56,090
What do you know
about Chinese medicine?

335
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,859
I'm more of a dabbler
than an expert, really.

336
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:00,760
I went to get acupuncture once,
but then I just kept thinking

337
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,629
about <i>Hellraiser</i> and that
guy with all the needles

338
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:03,387
in his face, I freaked out.

339
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:05,133
Okay, well, I have
a great acupuncturist.

340
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,433
He put this
herbal blend together;

341
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,101
it helped me
with seasickness.

342
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,736
- I'm all right, thanks.
- What do you mean you're good?

343
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:11,070
You don't trust me?

344
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:12,739
No, I trust you.
It's just, you know,

345
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:15,108
I like to do a full spectrum
analysis of anything new

346
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,044
before I, uh...
before I ingest it. It's fine.

347
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:20,479
All right, look at you. Come on.
Beggars can't be choosers, okay?

348
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:21,781
All right, okay.
Come on.

349
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,250
Come on, sweetie.
You'll be fine.

350
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:30,123
Hey, I'm Captain Gaines.
Welcome aboard the USNS <i>Tacoma.</i>

351
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,558
Special Agent Gregorio and Lund.
Thanks for having us.

352
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,659
Yeah, I wasn't given
much of a choice,

353
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:34,960
and I'm not sure
why you're here.

354
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,396
We just need to inspect
some cargo that you're hauling.

355
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:39,298
Inspections are traditionally
done in the port

356
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,666
of exit or entry.

357
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:43,502
Yeah, well, this is one of those
nontraditional inspections.

358
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:46,772
Just follow me below deck;
I'll bring you to your cargo.

359
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:53,779
PRIDE: <i>So we ask for the case</i>
<i>file on the fentanyl bust.</i>

360
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:55,881
We need access to
the evidence locker.

361
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:57,482
No reason to make
any accusations

362
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:59,317
till we know exactly
what's going on, right?

363
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:00,786
Yeah. Pride.

364
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,921
We go in there together,
they're gonna tense up,

365
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:04,856
think we're fishing
for something.

366
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,158
You want to go in solo?

367
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,693
I know you're friendly with 'em
and all, but...

368
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:10,195
I'm still an outsider.

369
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:11,862
They'll be more at ease with me.

370
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,331
You sure?

371
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,566
Yeah.

372
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:16,367
I don't expect to find
anything suspicious anyway.

373
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,035
I'll be right back.

374
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:20,104
All right.

375
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:22,574
(siren wailing in distance)

376
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:24,742
(phone ringing)

377
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:30,981
Hey, Rita.
Sorry about last night.

378
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,382
RITA:
Don't be.

379
00:13:32,384 --> 00:13:33,751
Work is work.

380
00:13:33,753 --> 00:13:35,219
Yeah, well,
I was hoping you'd still

381
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:36,987
be at NCIS when I got back,

382
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:38,355
but it was 2:00 in the morning.

383
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:39,690
Oh, we'll pick up
that conversation later.

384
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:40,990
Right now, I want to ask

385
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:43,126
what you know about
Audubon Industries.

386
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:45,462
Never heard of 'em. Why?
RITA: They're the company

387
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:46,896
buying up all the properties
in Clearwater.

388
00:13:46,898 --> 00:13:48,498
I'm about to go knock
on their door.

389
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,067
Why don't you wait for me.
We'll go in together.

390
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:52,236
Well, I'm here now.

391
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,370
And you're working.

392
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:54,571
I'll call you after.

393
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:55,839
Don't worry.

394
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:57,673
(line clicks, phone beeps)

395
00:13:57,675 --> 00:14:00,343
MARINO: <i>Let me show you what</i>
<i>we got on that fentanyl bust.</i>

396
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,612
Got to be around here somewhere.

397
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:04,313
Yeah, nothing
ever changes.

398
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:06,482
Sloppy ten years ago,
sloppy today.

399
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:08,051
How do you work
like this?

400
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:09,219
(chuckles)

401
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:10,653
I do have a system.

402
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,355
But you're wrong.

403
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:14,590
I haven't changed, but you have.

404
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,158
When I first met you,

405
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,694
you were a punk kid
who thought he knew everything.

406
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:19,928
Now look at you.

407
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,196
Yeah, still a punk.

408
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:22,998
Yeah, but you're
no longer a kid.

409
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,333
Seriously, though.

410
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:27,035
You were smart
to get out of this place,

411
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:28,904
make something
of yourself.

412
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:31,373
I should've done the same thing
when I had the options.

413
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,275
Well, you can always
change units.

414
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:35,144
Take the
sergeant's exam.

415
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:36,311
(chuckles)

416
00:14:36,313 --> 00:14:37,980
Not with my history.

417
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:40,749
Public Integrity's come
knocking a few too many times.

418
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,551
Drinking at work now?

419
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:45,220
It's medicinal.

420
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:49,157
Seriously, Richard,
you got me a little worried.

421
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,427
Look, you may have
that federal badge,

422
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,996
but you're still a rookie
in my books, okay?

423
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:56,798
Let me do the worrying.

424
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,100
Here's everything we have
on the fentanyl bust,

425
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:00,234
but Nathan Kelly's not involved.

426
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,703
How can you
be so sure?

427
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:05,807
'Cause it was a group
of chemistry majors

428
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:06,908
that watched too much
<i>Breaking Bad,</i>

429
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,109
thought they'd start a gang.

430
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:09,911
Every single one of them
is doing time,

431
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:12,446
and every ounce of their drugs
ended up in the evidence locker.

432
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:14,415
I'd like to take a look
at those drugs.

433
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,050
Why do you want to do that?

434
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:18,752
'Cause the fentanyl
we took off of Kelly

435
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:20,821
is an exact chemical match.

436
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:23,590
So you think Kelly broke into
the NOPD evidence locker

437
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:24,858
and stole the drugs?

438
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,926
(chuckles)

439
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:27,628
Clearly you've never met him.

440
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,262
Ah.

441
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,099
You think a cop did this.

442
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:34,868
Well, I don't want
to believe that,

443
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,237
but it's a
legitimate lead.

444
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,972
We need to
follow up on it.

445
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,473
Or you could just ask me.

446
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:41,441
I am asking.

447
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:42,943
Can I see the drugs?

448
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:44,644
No.

449
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:46,579
They're gone.

450
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,849
They were taken
to the incinerator last week.

451
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:50,116
Well, who signed them out?

452
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:52,752
I did. I took them
there myself, okay?

453
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:54,520
So consider
that lead followed.

454
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:56,322
Unless, of course,
you don't believe me,

455
00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:59,726
in which case, you might want to
get Public Integrity involved.

456
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:04,897
Hey, Richard,

457
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,433
I'm the rookie here, right?
Of course I believe you.

458
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:10,169
Must be some other explanation
how Kelly got the drugs.

459
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:12,671
Must be.

460
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:25,149
GAINES:
Unit number U.S. 2537-B.

461
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,318
Ah, here we are.

462
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,490
This is your locker.

463
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:33,892
Inside is your crate.

464
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,494
All right, thank you.

465
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,900
Here it is.

466
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:43,368
Just need to break the seal.

467
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,805
Uh, this seal's
already been broken.

468
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,540
Someone's been
inside the locker?

469
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,510
No, that's not possible.

470
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,415
Hmm, guessing that's the
crate we're looking for?

471
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,518
Yep, and whatever was
in it is gone now.

472
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,256
(exhales)

473
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,630
(siren wailing in distance)

474
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:21,405
You get access to the fentanyl?

475
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,906
(sighs)

476
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,743
What's going on?

477
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,212
Drugs are gone, King.

478
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,682
Signed straight out of evidence,
right into Kelly's hands.

479
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,283
You know who did it?

480
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:36,586
Yeah, but I sure as hell
wish I didn't.

481
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,890
It was Marino.

482
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,657
GREGORIO: <i>So, we searched</i>
<i>the Navy locker.</i>

483
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:01,193
The extra crate that Kelly
loaded was completely empty.

484
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:03,395
Any idea if the drugs
were ever in it?

485
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:05,530
Sebastian tested the crate,
came back positive

486
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:07,466
for the same fentanyl
Kelly was dealing.

487
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:08,900
Hi. It wasn't just
fentanyl though,

488
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:10,602
it was a whole
gamut of narcotics.

489
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:12,904
Talking cocaine, marijuana,
all your heroins.

490
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:14,539
I mean, you got your black
tar, your Colombian white,

491
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,140
your Afghan brown...
LASALLE: We get it Sebastian.

492
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:17,342
Lot of drugs.

493
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:20,111
500 pounds,
worth millions on the street.

494
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:21,613
And it's much more
than what Kelly got

495
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:22,914
from the NOPD
evidence locker.

496
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,349
You need to
search the ship.

497
00:18:24,351 --> 00:18:26,250
SEBASTIAN: Well, you know,
that's easier said

498
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:29,187
than done, you know, 'cause
this is a T-AKR class vessel.

499
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:31,589
That means
it's 965 feet long,

500
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:33,824
it's 40 feet deep, it's got
a 3000 TEU capacity.

501
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,059
I mean, do the math,
you know?

502
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:36,094
Actually, I'm gonna
do the math.

503
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:37,661
Sebastian.

504
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:38,963
Seasickness
getting to you?

505
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:40,331
Actually,
you know what? No.

506
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,034
Tammy gave me some
dynamite Chinese medicine,

507
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:44,768
and I feel great;
it's so awesome.

508
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,504
GREGORIO: Just might be
a side effect or two.

509
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,105
But we got another problem.

510
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,307
That crate was emptied
while the ship was at sea.

511
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,543
Means Kelly's got an accomplice
on the crew.

512
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,277
Find the accomplice,
you'll find the drugs.

513
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,212
Any luck figuring out

514
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:56,614
who gave Kelly access

515
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:58,415
to the confiscated drugs
in the first place?

516
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,385
We got some ideas.

517
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,421
PRIDE:
But nothing confirmed yet.

518
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:06,123
This is
a sophisticated operation.

519
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,258
We need to shut it down
before that ship

520
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,726
makes the Panama Canal.

521
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:10,446
Copy that.

522
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,795
You seen this thing?
It's nuts.

523
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:13,930
Get out of here.
You're gonna get me in trouble.

524
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:19,903
You really think Richard Marino
would steal drugs?

525
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:25,041
The Marino that was
my mentor and partner?

526
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:26,308
No.

527
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,977
But he's not that guy anymore.

528
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:30,413
Well, the drinking's
one thing.

529
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:32,148
We're talking
a major felony.

530
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,350
Well, he admitted he signed
for the confiscated fentanyl

531
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:36,052
out of evidence to be destroyed.

532
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:37,920
And now it's on that cargo ship.

533
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:39,221
If it's true,

534
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:41,424
Marino was in league with Kelly.

535
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:43,592
And we have no connection
between them

536
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:45,027
except last night's bust.

537
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:46,495
PATTON: You might not
have the connection,

538
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,797
but I do. Follow me.

539
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:53,334
<i>Here we go, right here.</i>

540
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:55,470
Brian Cooper.
Who's Brian Cooper?

541
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:58,406
Brian Cooper graduated
Western High School in 2010

542
00:19:58,408 --> 00:19:59,875
with Nathan Kelly.

543
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:01,910
They played varsity baseball,
and they're still part

544
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,078
of a summer ball league
together.

545
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,680
What's Cooper's
connection to Marino?

546
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:06,014
PATTON:
Cooper works the incinerator

547
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,249
for the New Orleans
Police Department.

548
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,885
Let's pay him a visit.

549
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,288
Good work, P.

550
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:16,191
SEBASTIAN: There are hundreds
of crates on this ship.

551
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:17,392
There's no way
we search them all

552
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:18,660
before we reach
the Panama Canal.

553
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:20,395
GREGORIO: And we know
at least one of the crew

554
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:21,897
is involved in
the smuggling operation.

555
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:23,498
No one can be trusted.

556
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,400
Not even us.

557
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:27,368
Ah, I'm kidding.
I'm just going with a thing.

558
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,338
I'm sorry.
I totally trust you, just...

559
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,440
Okay, well, I mostly trust you,
but you've been acting

560
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:33,774
weirder than usual.
Well, yeah.

561
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,910
It's these Chinese herbs
that you gave me, you know?

562
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:38,113
They're making me feel
all wired and tense and itchy.

563
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:39,147
Is that normal?

564
00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:40,582
I should've never
given them to you.

565
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:41,916
I like it,
though, you know?

566
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:43,584
I feel like I'm firing
on all cylinders.

567
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:45,385
Oh, good, well, maybe you
can use those cylinders

568
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:48,355
to lead us to where the
narcotics are hidden.

569
00:20:48,357 --> 00:20:49,957
I was just kidding,
Sebastian.

570
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,759
We have to do it the
old-fashioned way.

571
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,327
We need to check
every locker.

572
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:54,629
No. No, we don't.

573
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:55,830
W-We're thinking
about this all wrong.

574
00:20:55,832 --> 00:20:57,832
Why hide 500 pounds
of drugs in a locker

575
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,633
just to take them out
before you reach port?

576
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:00,967
It's too risky, unless...

577
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,737
They were never meant to reach
the port in the first place.

578
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:06,273
But where do you get rid
of 500 pounds of drugs

579
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:08,008
in the middle of the ocean?
Can't just throw them overboard.

580
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,244
Follow me,
I got an idea.

581
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:12,212
But it's gonna be smelly.
Smelly?

582
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:14,080
Wait, where are
we going?

583
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:23,356
Incinerator's going.

584
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:24,624

585
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:25,992
Cooper must be here.

586
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,861
Oh, Patton just sent me
everything he's got

587
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,262
on Brian Cooper.

588
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:30,764
He's been working
the incinerator

589
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:33,566
for seven years,
destroying drugs for NOPD,

590
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,967
state police and DEA.

591
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:36,335
Gives him access
to a lot of narcotics.

592
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,703

I-I tried to move out of
the way. It kept coming,

627
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:34,283
and then just rammed into me,
and the next thing I know,

628
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:35,584
my car was flipped over,

629
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,085

was speeding away.

00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:55,170
Yeah.

639
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,338
Okay, come on.

640
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:03,377
You weren't wrong
about the smell.

641
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:05,379
Why do you think
the drugs are here?

642
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:07,615
Well, on a ship,
recycling is stacked

643
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:09,550
and sorted to be
off-loaded at port.

644
00:24:09,552 --> 00:24:11,452
But compost is
dumped in the ocean

645
00:24:11,454 --> 00:24:13,153
before the ship reaches
its, uh, destination.

646
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:16,089
You think the drugs
are gonna be dumped?

647
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:17,725
Yeah, and then picked up
by whoever else is part

648
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,427
of the smuggling ring,
which means we have to search

649
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:20,961
all these garbage
containers right now.

650
00:24:20,963 --> 00:24:22,562
Come on, let's
get gross. (whoops)

651
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:23,897
Okay, I'll be over here.

652
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:27,634
Believe it or not, this doesn't
even rank my top ten

653
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:30,304
most disgusting places
to search.

654
00:24:30,306 --> 00:24:33,440
Glamorous life
of a field agent.

655
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:42,081
Sebastian,
I think I hit pay dirt.

656
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:46,419
(grunting)

657
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:50,423
(screams)

658
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,726
(Sebastian yells)

659
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:59,198
(panting)

660
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:03,469
That was unexpected.

661
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,171
You did great, baby.

662
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:06,705
You did great.

663
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:12,244
Uh, let's... put cuffs on him
or whatever happens next.

664
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:14,145
Do these fit him?

665
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:17,616
Loretta.

666
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,618
Ah. Is Dwayne
joining us?

667
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,553
No. Rita got in
some kind of accident.

668
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:24,055
She's okay, but he took her
to NCIS to be sure.

669
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:25,357
Okay.

670
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,192
What can you tell me
about Brian Cooper?

671
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,861
Uh, I can tell you
he wasn't burned alive.

672
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,863
Died of a single
gunshot wound to the chest.

673
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,232
Killer was trying to get rid
of the body and evidence.

674
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:36,234
If he was, he did
a poor job of it.

675
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:39,204
A drug incinerator usually has
an automatic cut-off function

676
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:42,573
whenever foreign materials
are introduced.

677
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,909
And that's why I was able
to recover these.

678
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,511
Pretty badly burned.

679
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:49,647
On the outside, yes,
but I pulled biologicals

680
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:52,283
from the inside of the gloves.

681
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:56,788
Christopher, not sure you're
gonna like what I came up with.

682
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,693
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

683
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,831
(siren wailing in distance)

684
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,036
MARINO:
I can't believe it.

685
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:15,339
You called in the rat squad
after all.

686
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:18,141
I'm so disappointed.

687
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,811
Nothing compared
to how I'm feeling.

688
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,780
MARINO:
You see this?

689
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,015
This is how they treat
a 25-year veteran.

690
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,517
No more lies, Marino.

691
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,785
You're breaking my heart.

692
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,822
No need to make
a scene, Richard.

693
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,556
“No need to make a Sc...”
Me make a scene?

694
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,691
What were you gonna do,
arrest me for theft?

695
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:39,028
No. We're gonna arrest you
for murder.

696
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,133
(handcuffs clicking)

697
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:58,059
Why am I looking at this?

698
00:26:58,948 --> 00:27:00,513
It's Brian Cooper,

699
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:04,150
incinerator operator
for the City of New Orleans.

700
00:27:04,152 --> 00:27:05,652
You think I killed Brian?

701
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:07,019
We know you did.

702
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:08,488
And why did I do that?

703
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,723
O-Over some fentanyl

704
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:12,224
I supposedly liberated
from evidence?

705
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:13,626
Not just fentanyl.

706
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:15,161
Hundreds of pounds
of other narcotics, too.

707
00:27:15,163 --> 00:27:17,897
You took the drugs
before they were destroyed.

708
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:21,700
Gave 'em to Nathan Kelly at
the port to smuggle onto a ship.

709
00:27:21,702 --> 00:27:26,038
Do I look like
some sort of criminal kingpin?

710
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,806
I don't know what I see anymore.

711
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:30,109
Ah. (chuckles)

712
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:32,445
So I'm a disappointment
to you, hmm?

713
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,713
You're way past
disappointing to me.

714
00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:36,648
All right, you're a disgrace.

715
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:47,593
I didn't kill anybody,
and I'm not a thief.

716
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:49,060
We got your DNA

717
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:52,197
off of gloves
that were dumped by the body.

718
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,906
Someone's trying
to frame me, Chris.

719
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:03,975
LASALLE: Yeah, 'cause you never take
responsibility for anything.

720
00:28:03,977 --> 00:28:06,144
MARINO: No, no, no, no, no.
Listen to me, okay?

721
00:28:06,146 --> 00:28:08,112
I-I know I do a lot of things.

722
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:09,313
I drink too much,
I'll cut corners

723
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:11,582
on a case,
and I'll manhandle a suspect,

724
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:14,217
but nothing...
nothing like this!

725
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:16,285
We don't have much time.
Nothing like this, Chris.

726
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,655
LASALLE: Come on,
do the right thing, Richard.

727
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:22,492
Give me the members
of the smuggling ring,

728
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:25,294
every last one of 'em...

729
00:28:25,296 --> 00:28:27,931
maybe I can cushion the blow.

730
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,071
You want to help me?

731
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:37,140
You can start by believing me.

732
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:41,377
I'm not the guy
you're looking for.

733
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,319
(door opens, closes)

734
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,362
I tried, King.

735
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,798
He's too far gone.

736
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,533
Maybe.

737
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,401
But there's
something off here.

738
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:08,403
Come on.

739
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:10,672
You don't really believe
he was set up.

740
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:13,641
Everything's
a little convenient--

741
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:15,777
Cooper's body, the gloves--

742
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:19,081
like it's tied up
in a bow for us.

743
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,482
Well, that's just
Richard being sloppy.

744
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:23,851
There's more.

745
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:26,320
Come on.

746
00:29:26,322 --> 00:29:30,892
Patton ran financials
on Kelly and Cooper.

747
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:35,063
Both of them had an infusion
of cash recently,

748
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,265
but Marino...

749
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:39,733
flat broke.

750
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:41,335
That's just him being careful.

751
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:44,771
Is he sloppy or is he careful?

752
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:47,241
Think about it.

753
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,510
That's the man who taught you
how to be a cop.

754
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:50,611
People change.

755
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:51,845
Not that much.

756
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:54,615
If it were me
in the interview room,

757
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:57,050
would I get the benefit
of the doubt?

758
00:29:59,287 --> 00:30:02,756
(computer beeping)

759
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,492
Gregorio, Sebastian,
tell me things.

760
00:30:05,494 --> 00:30:07,761
Suspect's name is
Mitchell Castor.

761
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:09,729
He's the maintenance
officer on the ship.

762
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,265
First, he refused to talk
until I threatened to leave him

763
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:13,833
with Sebastian
for round two.

764
00:30:13,835 --> 00:30:15,801
Heard you did quite a job

765
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:16,969
backing up your partner,
Sebastian.

766
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:18,371
I don't know
what came over me.

767
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:19,839
It's like I had superpowers.

768
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:21,307
LASALLE: What did
Mitchell Castor have to say?

769
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:23,343
Well, Kelly's the one who
brought him into the operation.

770
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:25,378
Plan was to dump
the drugs in the ocean,

771
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,779
marked with geotrackers,

772
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,648
then the buyers would collect
them later in a small boat.

773
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,582
It's a good way to avoid
Coast Guard and Navy patrols.

774
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:32,051
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, well, until this morning

775
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:33,886
when the Coast Guard
swept up the buyers.

776
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:35,387
And who are they?

777
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:36,822
Mexican drug cartel.

778
00:30:36,824 --> 00:30:38,758
They were buying back drugs
that were confiscated here

779
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,760
and redistributing them
in new territories.

780
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:43,428
Yeah, we essentially uncovered
a drug recycling operation.

781
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,330
Well, it takes
cash, planning.

782
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:47,199
None of our suspects
fit the bill.

783
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,467
There must be

784
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:49,535
a bigger player involved.

785
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:51,270
Mitchell has no idea
who's in charge,

786
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:53,405
but we did look into
his bank account information.

787
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:55,807
Yeah, a company has
been wiring him payments.

788
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:59,443
Uh, some offshore corporation
called Audubon Industries.

789
00:30:59,445 --> 00:31:01,012
You're kidding.

790
00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:03,181
That name mean something
to you, King?

791
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:14,225
Good morning.

792
00:31:14,227 --> 00:31:16,594
Morning for me.

793
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:18,596
Pretty sure
you never came to bed.

794
00:31:18,598 --> 00:31:21,199
This case is keeping me busy,

795
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:24,435
but I like knowing that
you were up here... safe.

796
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:29,674
Well, if I don't take
that job in Washington,

797
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:31,342
we could make it a habit.

798
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:32,810
Ah, I like
the sound of that.

799
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:34,778
(sighs)

800
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,615
Okay. Audubon Industries.

801
00:31:38,617 --> 00:31:40,584
And he's back, folks.

802
00:31:40,586 --> 00:31:42,186
(chuckles)

803
00:31:42,188 --> 00:31:45,055
Company's been buying up
properties in Clearwater.

804
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:47,758
Think they're involved
in our drug smuggling ring.

805
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,426
What did you
learn about them?

806
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:51,728
Not much. It's a
glorified shell company.

807
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,230
They've got an
empty office,

808
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:55,532
no more than a desk
and a phone, really,

809
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:57,900
and millions invested
in Clearwater.

810
00:31:57,902 --> 00:32:02,572
Yeah, probably financed from the
sale of confiscated narcotics.

811
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:06,909
And if Hamilton
is connected to Clearwater,

812
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:09,078
he must be connected
to the drugs.

813
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,313
He's too smart to have
any direct contact.

814
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:13,783
So, what? Someone's working
on his behalf?

815
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:16,986
That vice cop you arrested?

816
00:32:16,988 --> 00:32:19,222
Marino.

817
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:21,457
He's been plagued
by complaints for years.

818
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:23,225
Hard to believe
Hamilton would trust him.

819
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:25,026
Prefer a partner
beyond reproach.

820
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,962
So we're looking for
another cop.

821
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:28,530
Someone who Hamilton knows well.

822
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:29,732
Means they have history.

823
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:33,034
Find that cop,
we bring down Hamilton.

824
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,003
I'll go to City Hall
and request

825
00:32:35,005 --> 00:32:36,605
NOPD's personnel records.

826
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:38,874
No, no, no, no,
that's not a good idea.

827
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,108
Well, you don't have
the authority

828
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,376
to make the request-- I do.

829
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:43,845
Someone tried to kill you
yesterday.

830
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:46,248
I'm going to City Hall,
not an abandoned warehouse.

831
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,849
And I'm not asking
permission.

832
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:49,350
Okay, well, fine, then.

833
00:32:49,352 --> 00:32:50,852
Fine, then I'll come with you.

834
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:52,520
And I'm not asking
for permission eith...

835
00:32:52,522 --> 00:32:53,789
(door closes)

836
00:32:56,293 --> 00:32:58,593
Man, I got to
give it to you, Rita.

837
00:32:58,595 --> 00:32:59,994
You're as good
as your word.

838
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:01,663
You got every file
on every cop

839
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:03,931
who worked vice
in the last 15 years.

840
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:06,434
What can I say?
I don't take no for an answer.

841
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:08,436
Sort of like my
second ex-wife.

842
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:10,305
Though she didn't care much
for yes either.

843
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:11,471
We're looking for any cop

844
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:13,373
who has a relationship
with Hamilton.

845
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,475
Well, that's half
the department, right?

846
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:18,312
He considers himself
a friend to law and order.

847
00:33:18,314 --> 00:33:21,115
We need more than photo ops.
We need deep ties, favors done.

848
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:22,482
Someone who owes him.

849
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:25,119
How about a cop who was
in deep with Public Integrity?

850
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:27,387
I'm talking about
a confidential investigation

851
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:28,822
into drugs that went missing

852
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:30,457
from the evidence locker
five years ago.

853
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:31,991
Well, how could he still
be on the job?

854
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:34,661
Drugs magically reappeared
in evidence.

855
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:36,129
Investigation never went public,

856
00:33:36,131 --> 00:33:37,664
thanks to a letter
from Hamilton,

857
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,033
who headed up
the Criminal Justice Committee

858
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:42,235
for the city council.
Marino?

859
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:44,737
No. Jordan Spencer.

860
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:47,506
He almost lost his job for it,

861
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:48,808
and he went up
on charges.

862
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,509
And now he runs the vice unit?

863
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:53,046
That is quite a
change of fortunes.

864
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:54,780
Patton, ping whatever
you got to ping,

865
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,316
trace whatever you got to trace.

866
00:33:56,318 --> 00:33:58,084
We got to find Spencer now.

867
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,186
RITA:
And they're off.

868
00:34:01,188 --> 00:34:02,287
PATTON:
Yeah.

869
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:04,790
We do all the work,
they have all the fun.

870
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,760
Kind of makes you want
to tag along for the takedown.

871
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:09,595
Nah, we'd just get in the way.

872
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:12,398
Give Pride one more
thing to worry about.

873
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:20,372
(gate buzzes)

874
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:26,178
What's going on?

875
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,180
You locked up in Orleans Parish
is no good.

876
00:34:28,182 --> 00:34:29,514
Too many people know you here.

877
00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:30,849
SPENCER: Got permission
to transfer you

878
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,817
to St. Charles
till this gets figured out.

879
00:34:37,624 --> 00:34:39,724
(siren wailing)

880
00:34:39,726 --> 00:34:41,192
Spencer wasn't at NOPD, Patton.

881
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:42,727
Where are you on his location?

882
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:44,562
I got GPS on his cell phone.

883
00:34:44,564 --> 00:34:46,631
Spencer just left
Orleans Parish jail.

884
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:48,867
According to the records,
he got custody of Marino.

885
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:51,068
He's gonna kill Richard
and make sure he takes the fall.

886
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,303
Unless we stop him.

887
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:54,338
(tires screeching)

888
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:58,109
(siren continues wailing)

889
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,946
(siren wailing)

890
00:35:14,653 --> 00:35:17,560
You got yourself into
a real mess here, Richard.

891
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:19,996
You know I didn't do what
they're accusing me of, right?

892
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:21,463
Yeah, of course
we do, Marino.

893
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:23,732
Even you're not
that much of a screw-up.

894
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:24,800
(chuckles)

895
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:27,503
Aubrey, pull the car
over here.

896
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,671
What's going on?

897
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:48,023
MARINO:
Hey!

898
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:50,091
What are you,
what are you doing?!

899
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:51,459
No witnesses.

900
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:52,994
Get out of the car.

901
00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:55,563
Get out!

902
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,099
You lost your mind?!

903
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:00,935
PATTON: Spencer is
no longer on the move.

904
00:36:00,937 --> 00:36:02,169
He pulled over off the highway.

905
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:03,704
We need an exact location.

906
00:36:03,706 --> 00:36:05,071
There's an access road.

907
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:07,741
Zeroing in on
his precise coordinates now.

908
00:36:07,743 --> 00:36:09,108
You shot him!

909
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,244
No, <i>you</i> shot him, Richard.

910
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,279
After you managed
to get out of your cuffs.

911
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:14,280
You're out of your mind!

912
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:15,916
Cost of doing business.

913
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:18,318
Turn around, Richard!
This'll go fast.

914
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,385
Screw you.

915
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,254
(siren wails)

916
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:30,263
Cover me!
You got it.

917
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:33,232
(yells)

918
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:38,871
It's over, Spencer!
Drop it now!

919
00:36:38,873 --> 00:36:40,238
Drop the weapon!

920
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:49,247
Richard, you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,283
PRIDE:
Spencer.

922
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:54,186
Hey, hey, Spencer.
You're gonna be all right.

923
00:36:54,188 --> 00:36:56,588
Chris, call 911.
Hurry.

924
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,922
Spencer, we're gonna
cut you a deal.

925
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,924
A deal, you understand?

926
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,994
You're gonna be all right,
all right, and then you're gonna

927
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:03,295
talk to me,
and you're gonna tell me

928
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:04,296
everything about Mayor Hamilton.

929
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:06,031
All right?
We're gonna take him down.

930
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:08,133
You're gonna help me
take him down, you understand?!

931
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:09,434
Spencer!

932
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,969
You underst...

933
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:13,337
Spencer!

934
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:20,612
(panting)

935
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,690
Our only link
to Hamilton is dead,

936
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:35,826
which puts us back
at square one.

937
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:37,794
Not necessarily.

938
00:37:37,796 --> 00:37:39,430
We got a link to
Audubon Industries.

939
00:37:39,432 --> 00:37:41,765
Taking profit from
selling illegal drugs

940
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,267
to buy property
in Clearwater.

941
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:45,002
Still no connection
to Hamilton, though.

942
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:47,170
Dude, what's with all
the negativity here?

943
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:48,438
I'm sorry. I don't know.

944
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,073
It's just, I feel like
I'm coming down

945
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:51,508
from a high or
something, you know?

946
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,076
Must be the pills
that Gregorio gave me.

947
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:55,245
Sebastian, you're not
coming down from a high.

948
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:57,280
It's okay, all right?
I don't blame you.

949
00:37:57,282 --> 00:37:59,516
It's just that my body
is a delicate ecosystem.

950
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:02,318
Okay, so the pills...

951
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,787
were not even Chinese herbs.

952
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:08,791
Regular allergy medicine, over
the counter, nothing exotic.

953
00:38:08,793 --> 00:38:09,792
PATTON:
Dude,

954
00:38:09,794 --> 00:38:11,261
you got placebo'd.

955
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:12,762
(laughs)
Hold on, all right.

956
00:38:12,764 --> 00:38:15,198
Wait a minute.
Now, I wasn't seasick.

957
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,499
Right. Mm.
I wasn't nervous.

958
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:19,735
But I-I kicked that guy's ass.

959
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:21,336
Yeah, you did.

960
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:23,205
That's right,
no special drugs.

961
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:26,208
Just Forensic Agent Lund.

962
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,644
So what you're saying is...

963
00:38:28,646 --> 00:38:30,379
I'm kind of awesome.

964
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:32,281
Okay, that's my cue to go.

965
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:33,534
Wait, can you not?
Don't leave me.

966
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:34,484
No.

967
00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:36,218
Here, how about this?
How about you go onto Twitter,

968
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,153
and you tweet: hashtag
“Sebastian's awesome”?

969
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:40,089
Now you're thinking it.
You're thinking I'm awesome.

970
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:42,157
I mean, you're thinking
“Sebastian's awesome”"

971
00:38:51,902 --> 00:38:54,002
I wasn't sure
you was coming in.

972
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:55,570
I was at the hospital
seeing Roger.

973
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:56,738
Yeah? How's he doing?

974
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,840
He'll be good, eventually.

975
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:00,341
What are you doing here?

976
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:02,811
Pride and I was just
wrapping up the case.

977
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:04,178
Listen, I...

978
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,880
If you're gonna
apologize, don't.

979
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:09,183
You got nothing to be sorry for.

980
00:39:09,185 --> 00:39:11,685
You did your job,

981
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:13,721
and you saved my life.

982
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:16,424
Still, what I put you through...

983
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:17,558
No, Chris.

984
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,327
I'm a mess.

985
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,962
Have been for
quite a while now.

986
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,434
You know it doesn't always
have to be like that.

987
00:39:27,436 --> 00:39:30,604
Consider this
a wake-up call.

988
00:39:30,606 --> 00:39:32,640
Time to make some real changes.

989
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:39,113
You know, I haven't had a drink
since you arrested me.

990
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,548
That's good.

991
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,916
Yeah. Yeah.

992
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:47,454
I'm here if you need
anything, all right?

993
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,789
Look at you,
all grown up.

994
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,725
I mean it, Richard.

995
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:55,295
Me, too.

996
00:39:57,065 --> 00:39:59,165
Me, too.

997
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,813
(sighs)

998
00:40:14,815 --> 00:40:16,615
(trumpet playing jazz music
in distance)

999
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,284
I'm glad
you're still here.

1000
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:22,254
And you're just
getting in-- again.

1001
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:26,425
Yeah, well, a lot to wrap
up with Spencer dead.

1002
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:28,794
Yeah, sorry you couldn't
take him alive.

1003
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:31,596
But you'll figure out
another way to get to Hamilton.

1004
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,132
Not me. We.

1005
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,367
We're a great team.

1006
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:39,171
We just need to tie
Hamilton to Audubon,

1007
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:42,440
and I got a couple ideas how.

1008
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,642
What do you say
we hash 'em out

1009
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:45,776
over breakfast?

1010
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,312
And then what?

1011
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:51,148
You rush off into the night
again, while I wait here?

1012
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,518
Well, you're safe here, Rita.

1013
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,421
I'm a prosecutor, Dwayne.
I lead the charge.

1014
00:40:56,423 --> 00:40:59,457
I don't stay back and keep
the home fires burning.

1015
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,760
Well, Hamilton's different
than any case you've ever had.

1016
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:05,395
Okay? And I'm not gonna let
anything else happen to you.

1017
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:09,166
I don't want to worry
about my safety,

1018
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:10,901
and I don't want you to, either.

1019
00:41:15,942 --> 00:41:17,574
What's this?

1020
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,445
It's a list of jazz clubs
in D.C.,

1021
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:24,814
where musicians can sit in
any Sunday night.

1022
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,953
Is that what you want?

1023
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:32,155
Not sure it's what I want,

1024
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:36,126
but... it's what I need.

1025
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:38,527
Look, we're not
kids anymore.

1026
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,029
We don't rush in head first.

1027
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,965
We've got lives and careers.

1028
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:44,167
Whatever we're doing here
deserves attention.

1029
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,568
I'm paying attention, Rita.

1030
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,103
I know you are.

1031
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:50,173
But you need your full focus
to go after Hamilton.

1032
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:54,477
You don't need
to worry about me.

1033
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:58,714
Take him down, Dwayne,
and get closure.

1034
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:02,618
And-and when you have,
I'll be in D.C.

1035
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,954
I'm not convinced
that we have to end this.

1036
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:10,025
Nothing's ending,
we're just hitting pause.

1037
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,727
It's like a fermata.

1038
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:14,629
(chuckles)

1039
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,933
I'm gonna hold you to that.

1040
