in the oven, which I'm hoping I didn't burn.

我以为咱俩一起的时候我才是厨师
Here I thought I was the chef in this relationship.

44
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,329
在你放弃厨师身份之前
You may want to taste

45
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,298
最好先尝一下味道如何
the food before you relinquish the title.

46
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,201
你知道的 你真的不需要
Well, you know, you didn't really have to do

47
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,402
做这些
all of this.

48
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:03,270
你也不需要做那个
And you don't have to do that.

49
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:04,605
我能搞定
I got this.

50

-好的 -说实话
- Okay. - To be honest,

51
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:08,742
我可能别有用心
I might have an ulterior motive.

52
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:11,612
有几件事我想跟你说一下
There are a couple of things I wanted to talk to you about.

53
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:13,847
我觉得佳肴和美酒可能会
And I was thought the food and wine might

54
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,549
让我们谈得轻松些
make it a little easier.

55
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,851
这是有关清水市的吗
This about Clearwater?

56
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:18,852
啊
Ah!

57
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:20,654
是这样 几周前
So, few weeks ago...

58
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:23,089
-嗯 -在Brossette的案子里
- Yeah. - ...on the Brossette case,

{\a6}第三季第18集

59
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:25,825
我们了解到有几个地产开发项目被搁置
we learned several housing developments were shelved there.

60
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,860
-警力受到了限制 -是啊 Hamilton市长
- Police resources were curbed. - Yeah, Mayor Hamilton

61
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:31,064
是幕后主使 但是我们一直没找到原因
was behind all of it, but we never found out why.

62
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,098
我可能找到了
Well, I may have.

63
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,233
有人一直在
Someone's been buying

64
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,201
大量购买清水市的房产
properties in Clearwater at a huge rate,

65
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:38,037
如果对方不想卖 就强行把人赶走
pushing people out when they don't want to sell.

66
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,405
你觉得是Hamilton吗
And you think it's Hamilton?

67
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:41,106
这是有可能的
Well, it makes sense.

68
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:42,608
拒绝向居民提供市政服务
Deny services to the residents,

69
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,644
然后趁机进入 买走他们的房产
and then sweep in and buy their houses.

70
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:47,046
那是个贫穷的移民区
It's a poor immigrant community.

71
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,848
地产价值处在谷底
Property values are rock-bottom.

72
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,783
无利可取
No profits to be made.

73
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:53,352
我必须查出Hamilton的算盘
I have to figure out Hamilton's angle.

74
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:54,753
这是市政问题
Well, this is a city matter.

75
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:56,221
你是NCIS
You're NCIS.

76
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:57,622
没有管辖权
No jurisdiction.

77
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,291
但是 我呢
Me, on the other hand,

78
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:01,893
去趟清水市 找几个抱怨的人盘问一下
go to Clearwater, question some of the complainants,

79
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,495
搞清楚谁在购买房产
figure out who's buying the property,

80
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,797
尽力让地方检察官来处理这个案子
try and put a case together for the D.A.

81
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,499
Hamilton基本掌控了地方检察官的选举
Hamilton basically got the D.A. elected.

82
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,734
那里半数的办公人员都是他的人
He's kissing cousins with half the office.

83
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,604
你会把矛头指向自己的
You'd be putting a target on your back at work.

84
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,673
这就是我想跟你说的第二件事
That's the second thing I wanted to talk to you about.

85
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:18,710
呃 我可能不会留在地方检察官办公室了 Dwayne
Um... I may not be staying at the D.A.'s office, Dwayne.

86
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:20,545
-什么 -我找了个新工作
- What? - I got a job offer.

87

在华盛顿特区
It's in Washington, D.C.

90
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,255
哇哦 那真是
Wow, that's-that's...

91
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:32,957
真是件大事
that's a big deal.

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,758
没错
Yeah, it is.

93
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,994
他们想让我尽快去 但我一直在拖着
They want me ASAP, and I've been putting them off.

94
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:37,962
为什么
Why?

95
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,997
你一定要问吗
You have to ask?

96
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:43,667
听着 我不是那种说走就走的人 你也不是
Look, I'm not one to cut and run, and neither are you.

97
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:46,136
但无论我们之间是什么关系
But whatever this is between us,

98
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,472
都值得给个机会 你说呢
it deserves a chance, don't you think?

99
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:51,274
我同意
Yes, I do.

100
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:55,646
哦 好吧 我知道那是什么意思
Oh, yeah. I know what that means.

101
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:57,481
不 不一定...
No, no. No, not neces...

102
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:59,083
是Gregorio
It's Gregorio.

103
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:00,683
我们有案子了
We caught a case.

104
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:04,421
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,823
我可以吃更多的面包布丁了
Eh, more bread pudding for me.

106
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,326
回头聊
Talk later.

107
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:10,327
好
Yeah.

108
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,962
你来洗盘子
You got the dishes.

109
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,097
还真不少呢
There are plenty of 'em.

110
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:20,069
受害者名叫Nathan Kelly
Victim's name is Nathan Kelly.

111
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:22,639
白天在港口做海军承包商

112
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:24,107
晚上做毒品交易
drug dealing by night.

113
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:26,109
但他的结局并不好
Didn't turn out too well for him.

114
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,112
Kelly先生被格洛克17型手枪击中三次
Mr. Kelly was shot three times with a Glock Model 17.

115
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:30,513
你一般不是得把尸体
Don't you usually have to get the body

116
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:31,881
运回验尸房才能确定死因吗
back to the morgue before you know that?

117
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:33,782
这次 我们有武器和枪手
This time, we have the weapon and the shooter.

118
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:35,684
Kelly在交易中举止疯狂
Kelly acted crazy during the deal.

119
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:37,153
警方的缉毒队不得不干掉他
NOPD Vice had to take him out.

120
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:39,087
他当时在跟一个卧底警察做毒品交易吗
He was dealing drugs to an undercover cop?

121
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:41,390

A synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin.

123
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:46,495
那儿大概有一公斤
About a kilo of it over there.

124
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:48,096
这份量可不小
That's some heavy weight.

125
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:50,231
一个码头工人是怎么能拿到的呢
How does a dock worker get his hands on it?

126
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,233
我们希望你们能回答这个问题
We're hoping you could answer that question.

127
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:53,902
如果你们这些联邦探员
If you Feds can spare

128
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:55,737
能拿出一点宝贵时间的话
some of your precious time.

129
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,340
特别探员Lasalle
Special Agent Lasalle.

130
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,976
嗨 我向来愿意插手
Hey, always willing to step in

131
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:02,978
解决地方问题 Spencer警长
and fix the locals' messes, Sergeant Spencer.

132
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,479
嘿 他现在其实是高级警官了
Hey, he's Lieutenant Spencer, actually.

133
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:06,181
-真的吗 -是
- For real? - Yep.

134
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:07,215
你又升职了
You got promoted again?

135
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:09,184
真是扶摇直上啊
Always failing upward.

136
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:19,894
见到你真好
Good to see you.

137
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:21,429
我猜 你们交情很深
Let me guess, you guys go back.

138
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,197
-我是Spencer -Gregorio

139
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,800
Aubrey警探
Detective Aubrey.

140
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:28,335
我们手把手教LaSalle如何做一名警察
We taught LaSalle everything he knows about being a cop.

141
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:30,671
是啊 就花了一个小时 剩下都是我自己学的
Yeah, it took an hour, and I improvise the rest.

142
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:32,406
然后Pride就把他从缉毒队带走了
And then Pride stole him away from vice.

143
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,075
把他的朋友们都忘了
Forgot about his pals.

144
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:35,943
好久没见你出现在周二酒会了
Haven't seen you for Tuesday drinks in a while.

145
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:38,112
啊 我的聚会生涯已经中断了
Ah, my partying days are curtailed.

146
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:39,379
忙着跟犯罪作斗争呢
Busy fighting crime.

147
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,347
说到这儿
Speaking of which,

148
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,549
知道Kelly这事是什么情况吗
any idea what Kelly was into here?

149
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,351
城里已经一年没出现过芬太尼了
City's been fentanyl-free for a year.

150
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:47,053
几周前 它又卷土重来渗入街头巷尾
Couple weeks ago, it's back on the street with a vengeance.

151
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,488
你们认为Kelly是供货商吗
You think Kelly's the supplier?

152
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,090
不 Kelly只是里面的一个小走卒
Nah. Kelly's on the thug end of the spectrum.

153
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:52,526
但是Marino这几天一直在调查他
But Marino's been working him for the past couple days.

154
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:53,993
非常确定他在港口那边有联络人
Pretty sure he's got a hookup down at the ports though.

155
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:55,229
可能是海军的人
Maybe a Navy connection.

156
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,429
希望你们能查出来
Hoping you guys could check that out.

157
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:58,031
对了 Marino人呢
Where's Marino anyway?

158
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,100
他又成了宿醉的大块头么
He working another monster hangover?

159
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:01,167
你没听说吗
You didn't hear?

160
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,169
交易出了问题 Chris
Deal went bad, Chris.

161
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,338
Marino中了一枪
Marino took a bullet.

162
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:19,285
嘿 哇
Hey. Whoa.

163
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,354
我以前的搭档来了哈
It's my former partner, huh?

164
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:23,088
还有个新来的
And the new guy.

165
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,923
Chris加入NCIS都快十年了
Been almost ten years since Chris joined NCIS.

166
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:27,293
我想你不能管我叫新来的人了
I don't think you can call me the new guy anymore.

167
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:29,327
是我带他入的行
I'm the one that broke him in.

168
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,063
我到现在还不能相信
And I'm still not convinced

169
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:33,265
他加入NCIS不是临时的
this whole NCIS thing isn't just a phase.

170
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,234
如果你想让我来见你 打电话就可以了
You want me to come visit, you should just call,

171
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:36,835
不用来个枪战
not get in a shootout.

172
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:38,036
算不上是枪战
Wasn't much of a shootout.

173
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:39,537
我都没来得及掏枪
I didn't even get to my weapon.

174
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,007
你还在你的脚踝上配枪呢
You're still wearing your gun on your ankle.

175
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,575
就像那个电影里一样
Just like in that movie.

176
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:44,943
《法国贩毒网》 兄弟
<i>French Connection,</i> baby.

177
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,511
看看
Look at that.

178
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:48,313
这可是现代经典
It's a modern-day classic.

179
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:49,447
我猜你到现在都没看那个电影呢
I bet you still haven't seen it.

180
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,815
在我的观影列表上了
It's on my list.

181
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:55,654
你真的可以喝酒吗
Sure you should be doing that?

182
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:58,122
庆祝我奇迹般的生还
Celebrating my miraculous survival.

183
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:00,925
近身射击 顶多就是擦伤
Shot point-blank, barely a scratch.

184
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:02,226
在我看来比擦伤严重多了
Looks like more than a scratch to me.

185
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:03,694
还好 没事
Yeah, well.

186
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:05,963
-你应该看看那个人的样子 -我们看过了
- You should see the other guy. - Yeah, we did.

187
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,765
鉴于他说不了话了 我们希望你能说说
Since he can't talk, we're hoping you will.

188
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,700
当然了 Dwayne 但我觉得没太多可说的
Sure, Dwayne. I don't think there's much to tell.

189
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:13,437
你认为Kelly通过码头走私芬太尼吗
You think Kelly was getting his fentanyl in through the port?

190
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,341
一定是 我们去年遏制了他们在本地的制毒活动
Must've. I mean, we shut down the local operation last year.

191
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:19,242
拿下了他的一个大型制毒实验室
Took out one of his big drug labs.

192
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:20,678
查获了50千克毒品
Confiscated 50 keys.

193
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,845
那真是很大一批
That's quite a haul.

194
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:23,447
对啊 我职业生涯中最大一批
Yeah, biggest of my career.

195
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,317
虽然不知怎么 Spencer得了所有的功劳
Though somehow, Spencer got all the credit

196
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,884
还有获得了升职
and the big promotion.

197
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:29,453
你们是一组的嘛 对他也是好事 不是吗
Well, you're a team. Good for him, right?

198
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:31,755
他得的是功劳 我得的是枪子
He got the reward, and I got the bullet.

199
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,324
还真是公平的买卖
Uh, that's a fair deal.

200
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:35,091
Kelly一定有某种渠道
Well, Kelly must've had some kind of connection

201
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,260
-走私毒品 -嗯
- bringing in the drugs. - Huh?

202
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:39,762
他过去一直给来自世界各地的船只
I mean, he was loading and unloading Navy cargo

203
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:41,597
装卸海军货物
off ships from all over the world.

204
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,099
有特殊权限
Had special clearance.

205
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:44,367
你认为有海军走私毒品
You think Navy personnel are smuggling drugs

206
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:45,568
到新奥尔良
into New Orleans?

207
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:49,239
我只是一个街警
I'm just a street cop.

208
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,141
我拿工资只是干些破门而入的事情
They pay me to bust down doors.

209
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:53,810
梳理案情这种事还是留给那些
I'll leave it to the, uh, professional investigators

210
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:55,511
专业的调查人员吧
to put the pieces together.

211
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:57,246
也许这个案子我们可以合作
Maybe we can work together on this.

212
00:07:57,248 --> 00:08:00,049
你别再喝酒了 好好休息
You lay off the booze and get some rest.

213
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:01,651
Molly来接你吗
Molly picking you up?

214
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,853
喔
Ooh.

215
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:06,188
看来咱俩确实很久没见了 Chris
I guess it has been a while, Chris.

216
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,724
呃
Um...

217
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:09,524
Molly离开我了
Molly left me.

218
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,361
可能我是需要时间才会被欣赏的人吧
Guess I'm an acquired taste.

219
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:13,795
很遗憾听到这个
Sorry to hear that.

220
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:15,164
嗯
Mm.

221
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,967
来吧 我送你回家
Come on. I'll take you home.

222
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:20,102
好
All right.

223
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:30,679
好了 根据警方的说法 Kelly利用进货船只
Okay. According to NOPD, Kelly was smuggling fentanyl

224
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,681
走私芬太尼
off of incoming cargo ships.

225
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:34,549
问题是 他卸货的船只
Problem is, the vessels he was off-loading

226
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,251
都是从南半球来的
come from the Southern Hemisphere.

227
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:38,987
芬太尼一般是在中国和东亚生产的
Fentanyl's usually manufactured in China and East Asia.

228
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:41,722
如果Kelly是国际贩毒集团的一员
If Kelly was a part of an international drug ring,

229
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:44,425
在他的电子记录中一定会有痕迹
there'd be signs in his digital life--

230
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:46,594
电话 邮件
phone calls, e-mails,

231
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,763
在暗网的活动... 但什么都没有
activity in the Dark Web-- but there's nothing.

232
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,390
还有一处矛盾
There is one discrepancy.

233
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:51,790
Kelly昨天给一艘
Kelly was loading a ship

234
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,025
开往巴拿马运河的船装货
that was bound for the Panama Canal yesterday.

235
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:56,161
一百箱干货运给
A hundred crates of dry goods for

236
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,429
Tacoma号美国海军舰艇
the USNS <i>Tacoma.</i>

0
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,429
{\a6}Tacoma：城市名，位于华盛顿州

237
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:00,131
他最后装运了101个箱子
He ended up loading 101 crates.

238
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,600
手动修改了航行日志
Did a manual correction in the ship's log.

239
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:04,870
我联系了海军后勤官
I contacted the Navy logistics officer.

240
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:07,672
并没有记录这个多出来的箱子
There's no record of this extra crate.

241
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:09,074
King 如果Kelly不是
King, what if Kelly wasn't

242
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:12,143
把毒品走私到新奥尔良
smuggling drugs <i>in</i> to New Orleans...

243
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,544
而是把毒品走私出去
But smuggling them out.

244
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,713
私下瞒天过海抽出一千克来卖
Skimmed a key off the top to sell on the side,

245
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:17,348
被警察发现了
got clipped by the cops.

246
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,517
但我们依然不知道是谁给他供货
Still doesn't answer the question of who supplied him.

247
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,353
继续调查Kelly的日常 一定会有线索的
Keep digging into Kelly's life; there's got to be something.

248
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:24,188
我虽然不能告诉你Kelly的日常
Well, I might not be able to tell you about Kelly's life,

249
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,956
但我可以给你讲讲他持有的毒品
but I can tell you about the drugs that he had.

250
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,458
看 每一批合成毒品
See, every batch of synthetic narcotics

251
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,760
都有他自己独特的化学配方
has its own unique chemical recipe,

252
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:30,294
就像DNA一样
kind of like DNA.

253
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:32,529
那包在Kelly车里发现的芬太尼
Well, the brick of fentanyl that was in Kelly's car,

254
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,064
是在新奥尔良本地生产的
that was manufactured here in New Orleans.

255
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,665
就是去年缉毒组查封的那个制毒实验室生产的
From the same drug lab that vice busted last year.

256
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,968
对 就是那次被查获的
Yeah, from the same batch that was confiscated

257
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,836
那批毒品 正常来说
in that bust. By all accounts,

258
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:42,172
现在应该在警方的证物室里
this should be in an NOPD evidence locker.

259
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,074
但不知怎么 Kelly得到了这批毒品
Somehow, Kelly got possession of the drugs.

260
00:09:44,076 --> 00:09:45,809
如果这是真的
Well, if that's true,

261
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:47,511
那么他不可能是单独作案
then he definitely couldn't have done it alone.

262
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:49,880
他在警局中一定有内应
He had to have help from inside the NOPD.

263
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,815
不只是警局
Not just NOPD.

264
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,417
而是缉毒队
The vice squad.

265
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,951
我的旧部
My old unit.

266
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:56,252
你是在暗指这个
I mean, that's what you're suggesting,

267
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:58,455
对吧
isn't it?

268
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:10,921
现在的情况是 有人从警局
So we're saying that someone stole 50 kilos

269
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:12,455
偷了50千克的芬太尼
of fentanyl from the NOPD,

270
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:14,625
交给Kelly去走私到国外
gave it to Kelly to smuggle out of the country.

271
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:15,626
也许是个缉毒警
Probably a vice cop.

272
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:17,060
我们现在可一点证据都没有
We have no proof of that.

273
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,796
我检验了毒品
Well, I-I tested the drugs.

274
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:21,664
他们是同一批生产的 这就是非常有力的证据
They're from the same batch; that's pretty strong evidence.

275
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,133
对我来说可不是 Sebastian
Not to me, Sebastian.

276
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:26,002
你说我曾经的同僚腐败的时候 我就不认同
Not when you're talking about my old unit being corrupt.

277
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:27,303
我只是说这些药是同一批
I'm just saying that the drugs match,

278
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:29,439
-就这样 -你不了解他们
- that's all. - You don't know these guys.

279
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:32,842
Katrina飓风后 我的房子被毁了 Marino收留了我
After Katrina, my house was destroyed, Marino took me in.

280
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:34,144
队里的其他人
The rest of the unit,

281
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,311
他们帮我重建房子 每一天
they helped rebuild; every day,

282
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:36,979
下班后 他们都在那儿
after work, they pitched in.

283
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:39,181
那样的人是不会做这种事的
All right, guys like that don't do this!

284
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:40,182
Christopher
Christopher.

285
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,418
让我们一步一步来
Let's take this one step at a time.

286
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,920
好了 我们知道Kelly手里
Okay, we know that Kelly

287
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:45,421
有芬太尼 而且证据显示
had the fentanyl, and it looks like

288
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:47,156
他把这些毒品装上了一艘货船
he loaded it onto a cargo ship.

289
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:49,291
一艘开往巴拿马运河的货船
Which is currently headed for the Panama Canal.

290
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:50,626
联系海岸警卫队
Contact the Coast Guard.

291
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,662
登上那艘船 找到多出来的那个箱子
Get on that ship. Find the extra crate.

292
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:53,863
那什么 我也应该去的
Oh, you know what, I should go, too.

293
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:55,830
我以为你不太喜欢船
I thought you and boats don't get along so well.

294
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:57,232
不 我喜欢船 只是怕水
No, I love boats, it's just the water

295
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:58,300
水让我想要尖叫
that makes me want to hurl.

296
00:10:58,302 --> 00:10:59,634
但重点是你需要我
But the point is you're gonna need me

297
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:00,769
去检测芬太尼
to test the fentanyl.

298
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:02,371
除此之外 我现在是个NCIS探员 好吗
Besides, I'm an NCIS agent now, right?

299
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:04,206
从某方面来说 我总得克服晕船
I got to get my sea legs at some point.

300
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,941
带上他吧
Take him.

301
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:07,709
走吧
Come on.

302
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,011
如果你敢吐我身上 我就开枪打你
If you throw up on me, I'll shoot you.

303
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:11,913
别有压力 好吗
No pressure, though, right?

304
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:19,788
我以前跟这些警察在一起 他们就像是家人
Now, I came up with these cops. They're like family.

305
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,189
你也了解他们的
You know 'em, too.

306
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:22,857
他们像是那种
Now, they seem like the kind of people

307
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:25,226
会拿不义之财的人吗
who would take a penny that doesn't belong to 'em?

308
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,828
我们说的可不是小钱 Christopher
We're not talking about a penny, Christopher.

309
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,265
听着 他们是好人 但我们还是得调查下去
Look, they're good guys, but we-we got to investigate.

310
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:33,033
你这样完全是带有个人情感
This is all kinds of personal for you,

311
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:35,035
如果跟你的关系太近了 那...
so if it's too close to home, then...

312
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:36,337
不 我很好
No, I'm good.

313
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,539
我们去缉毒组吧
Let's go to vice.

314
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,281
你还好吧
You gonna be all right?

315
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:50,450
还行 飞行过程比我想的颠了一点
Yeah. That flight was a little choppier than I would've liked.

316
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:51,785
我好像用完防晕贴了
Think I'm all out of patches.

317
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,553
好吧 来试试这个
All right, well, look, take one of these.

318
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,554
这是啥
What is it?

319
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:56,090
听说过中医么
What do you know about Chinese medicine?

320
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,859
我虽然不是专家 但还是懂一点
I'm more of a dabbler than an expert, really.

321
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:00,760
我以前去针灸过一次 但我一直忍不住去想
I went to get acupuncture once, but then I just kept thinking

322
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,629
电影《猛鬼追魂》里面的那个满脸是针的人
about <i>Hellraiser</i> and that guy with all the needles

323
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:03,387
然后我就吓成狗了
in his face, I freaked out.

324
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:05,133
好吧 我有个很棒的针灸师
Okay, well, I have a great acupuncturist.

325
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,433
他把这种草药混在一起
He put this herbal blend together;

326
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,101
对我的晕船很有帮助
it helped me with seasickness.

327
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,736
-我很好 谢谢 -你这是什么意思
- I'm all right, thanks. - What do you mean you're good?

328
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:11,070
你不信任我么
You don't trust me?

329
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:12,739
不 我相信你 只是
No, I trust you. It's just, you know,

330
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:15,108
我喜欢在摄入任何新东西之前
I like to do a full spectrum analysis of anything new

331
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,044
做个完全的分析检测 就这样
before I, uh... before I ingest it. It's fine.

332
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:20,479
行了 你看看你 都这样了还挑三拣四
All right, look at you. Come on. Beggars can't be choosers, okay?

333
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:21,781
好了 赶紧走吧
All right, okay. Come on.

334
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,250
来吧 没事的
Come on, sweetie. You'll be fine.

335
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:30,123
我是Gaines船长 欢迎登上Tacoma号舰艇
Hey, I'm Captain Gaines. Welcome aboard the USNS <i>Tacoma.</i>

336
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,558
特别探员Gregorio和Lund 感谢让我们登船
Special Agent Gregorio and Lund. Thanks for having us.

337
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,659
我也没有别的选择
Yeah, I wasn't given much of a choice,

338
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:34,960
不清楚你们为什么来这里
and I'm not sure why you're here.

339
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,396
我们要调查你们运输的一些货物
We just need to inspect some cargo that you're hauling.

340
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:39,298
一般都是在进出港口时
Inspections are traditionally done in the port

341
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,666
检查
of exit or entry.

342
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:43,502
是 但这次不是一般的检查
Yeah, well, this is one of those nontraditional inspections.

343
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:46,772
跟我到甲板下面吧 我带你们去货物那儿
Just follow me below deck; I'll bring you to your cargo.

344
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:53,779
我们要查看芬太尼突击搜查案的卷宗
<i>So we ask for the case</i> <i>file on the fentanyl bust.</i>

345
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:55,881
我们需要进到证物间
We need access to the evidence locker.

346
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:57,482
在我们查明真相前
No reason to make any accusations

347
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:59,317
没理由做出任何指控 好么
till we know exactly what's going on, right?

348
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:00,786
好的 Pride
Yeah. Pride.

349
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,921
我们一起进去 他们肯定紧张
We go in there together, they're gonna tense up,

350
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:04,856
觉得我们在查什么东西
think we're fishing for something.

351
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,158
你想一个人进去
You want to go in solo?

352
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,693
我知道你对他们很友善 但是...
I know you're friendly with 'em and all, but...

353
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:10,195
我始终是个外人
I'm still an outsider.

354
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:11,862
他们跟我一起会更放松
They'll be more at ease with me.

355
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,331
你确定
You sure?

356
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,566
嗯
Yeah.

357
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:16,367
反正我也不期望找到什么可疑的东西
I don't expect to find anything suspicious anyway.

358
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,035
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

359
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:20,104
好的
All right.

360
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:30,981
嘿 Rita 昨晚的事很抱歉
Hey, Rita. Sorry about last night.

361
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,382
别这样
Don't be.

362
00:13:32,384 --> 00:13:33,751
工作就是工作
Work is work.

363
00:13:33,753 --> 00:13:35,219
我本来希望我回去的时候
Yeah, well, I was hoping you'd still

364
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:36,987
你还在NCIS
be at NCIS when I got back,

365
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:38,355
但已经是凌晨两点了
but it was 2:00 in the morning.

366
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:39,690
这事还是晚点再说吧
Oh, we'll pick up that conversation later.

367
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:40,990
现在我想问问
Right now, I want to ask

368
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:43,126
你知道"Audubon工业"么
what you know about Audubon Industries.

369
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:45,462
-从来没听说过 怎么了 -他们就是
- Never heard of 'em. Why? - They're the company

370
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:46,896
买下清水市所有地产的公司
buying up all the properties in Clearwater.

371
00:13:46,898 --> 00:13:48,498
我要上他们的门了
I'm about to go knock on their door.

372
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,067
为什么不等我 我们可以一起去
Why don't you wait for me. We'll go in together.

373
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:52,236
我已经在这了
Well, I'm here now.

374
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,370
你不还在工作么
And you're working.

375
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:54,571
我等会再打给你
I'll call you after.

376
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:55,839
别担心
Don't worry.

377
00:13:57,675 --> 00:14:00,343
给你看我们突击搜查芬太尼的所有资料
<i>Let me show you what</i> <i>we got on that fentanyl bust.</i>

378
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,612
应该就放在这附近
Got to be around here somewhere.

379
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:04,313
嗯 一切都没变
Yeah, nothing ever changes.

380
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:06,482
十年前杂乱无章 现在还是这样
Sloppy ten years ago, sloppy today.

381
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:08,051
你是怎么在这种情况下工作的
How do you work like this?

382
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:10,653
我真的是有逻辑的
I do have a system.

383
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,355
但你错了
But you're wrong.

384
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:14,590
我没变 可是你变了
I haven't changed, but you have.

385
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,158
我第一次见你的时候
When I first met you,

386
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,694
你是个以为自己无所不知的毛头小子
you were a punk kid who thought he knew everything.

387
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:19,928
现在看看你
Now look at you.

388
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,196
嗯 还是个毛头小子
Yeah, still a punk.

389
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:22,998
但你不再是小孩子了
Yeah, but you're no longer a kid.

390
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,333
不过 说真的
Seriously, though.

391
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:27,035
你离开这里是明智的选择
You were smart to get out of this place,

392
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:28,904
做点个人的成就
make something of yourself.

393
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:31,373
我也应该在有选择的时候出走
I should've done the same thing when I had the options.

394
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,275
你一直都可以选择换部门
Well, you can always change units.

395
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:35,144
参加警官考试
Take the sergeant's exam.

396
00:14:36,313 --> 00:14:37,980
我有黑历史可不行
Not with my history.

397
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:40,749
公共廉政组找过我很多次
Public Integrity's come knocking a few too many times.

398
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,551
现在工作也喝酒么
Drinking at work now?

399
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:45,220
这是药用的
It's medicinal.

400
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:49,157
说真的 Richard 我有点担心你
Seriously, Richard, you got me a little worried.

401
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,427
听着 你现在是有了FBI的徽章
Look, you may have that federal badge,

402
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,996
但你在我这儿还是个新手 好吗
but you're still a rookie in my books, okay?

403
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:56,798
担心这事就交给我吧
Let me do the worrying.

404
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,100
这是搜查芬太尼案的所有资料
Here's everything we have on the fentanyl bust,

405
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:00,234
但是Nathan Kelly与此无关
but Nathan Kelly's not involved.

406
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,703
你怎么能确定
How can you be so sure?

407
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:05,807
因为那是一帮化学专业的学生
'Cause it was a group of chemistry majors

408
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:06,908
看了太多《绝命毒师》
that watched too much <i>Breaking Bad,</i>

409
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,109
也想着成立一个帮派
thought they'd start a gang.

410
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:09,911
每个人都在监狱里呆着呢
Every single one of them is doing time,

411
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:12,446
每盎司毒品都在证物室里
and every ounce of their drugs ended up in the evidence locker.

412
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:14,415
我想去看看那些毒品
I'd like to take a look at those drugs.

413
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,050
你为什么要去
Why do you want to do that?

414
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:18,752
因为我们从Kelly那儿拿到的芬太尼
'Cause the fentanyl we took off of Kelly

415
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:20,821
与那批毒品完全匹配
is an exact chemical match.

416
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:23,590
你是说Kelly闯进警方的证物室
So you think Kelly broke into the NOPD evidence locker

417
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:24,858
然后偷走了毒品
and stole the drugs?

418
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:27,628
显然你从没见过他
Clearly you've never met him.

419
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,262
哈
Ah.

420
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,099
你觉得是个警察干的
You think a cop did this.

421
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:34,868
我不想这样认为
Well, I don't want to believe that,

422
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,237
但这是个合理的线索
but it's a legitimate lead.

423
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,972
我们得继续跟进
We need to follow up on it.

424
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,473
或者你可以直接问我
Or you could just ask me.

425
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:41,441
我正在问你
I am asking.

426
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:42,943
我能看看毒品么
Can I see the drugs?

427
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:44,644
不行
No.

428
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:46,579
都没了
They're gone.

429
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,849
上周丢进焚化炉给烧了
They were taken to the incinerator last week.

430
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:50,116
那谁签的字
Well, who signed them out?

431
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:52,752
是我 我亲自押运的 好么
I did. I took them there myself, okay?

432
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:54,520
这样逻辑就清楚了
So consider that lead followed.

433
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:56,322
当然了 除非你不相信我
Unless, of course, you don't believe me,

434
00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:59,726
那样的话 你可以去找公共廉政组
in which case, you might want to get Public Integrity involved.

435
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:04,897
嘿 Richard
Hey, Richard,

436
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,433
我在这儿就是个新人 好么 我当然相信你
I'm the rookie here, right? Of course I believe you.

437
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:10,169
一定有别的原因 解释Kelly怎样拿到那些毒品
Must be some other explanation how Kelly got the drugs.

438
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:12,671
一定有
Must be.

439
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:25,149
序列号U.S. 2537-B
Unit number U.S. 2537-B.

440
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,318
就这儿了
Ah, here we are.

441
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,490
这就是你们要找的储物间
This is your locker.

442
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:33,892
里面是你们的箱子
Inside is your crate.

443
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,494
好了 谢谢你
All right, thank you.

444
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,900
在这里
Here it is.

445
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:43,368
只要打开封条就行了
Just need to break the seal.

446
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,805
呃 这个封条已经打开了
Uh, this seal's already been broken.

447
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,540
有人来过这个隔间吗
Someone's been inside the locker?

448
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,510
不 那不可能
No, that's not possible.

449
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,415
估计这就是我们要找的货物吧
Hmm, guessing that's the crate we're looking for?

450
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,518
对 现在里面的东西都没了
Yep, and whatever was in it is gone now.

451
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:21,405
你有接触到芬太尼么
You get access to the fentanyl?

452
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:26,743
怎么了
What's going on?

453
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,212
毒品都没了 King
Drugs are gone, King.

454
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,682
直接从证物室签字出来 到了Kelly手中
Signed straight out of evidence, right into Kelly's hands.

455
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,283
你知道谁干的么
You know who did it?

456
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:36,586
嗯 但我真希望我不知道
Yeah, but I sure as hell wish I didn't.

457
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,890
是Marino干的
It was Marino.

458
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,657
所以 我们搜查了海军储物间
<i>So, we searched</i> <i>the Navy locker.</i>

459
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:01,193
Kelly多装的那个箱子是空的
The extra crate that Kelly loaded was completely empty.

460
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:03,395
是否知道毒品可能曾放在里面
Any idea if the drugs were ever in it?

461
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:05,530
Sebastian测试了箱子 结果呈阳性
Sebastian tested the crate, came back positive

462
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:07,466
和Kelly倒卖的芬太尼是同一种
for the same fentanyl Kelly was dealing.

463
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:08,900
嗨 不仅仅是芬太尼
Hi. It wasn't just fentanyl though,

464
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:10,602
而是各种各样的毒品
it was a whole gamut of narcotics.

465
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:12,904
像是可卡因 大麻 海洛因
Talking cocaine, marijuana, all your heroins.

466
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:14,539
黑焦油 哥伦比亚白粉
I mean, you got your black tar, your Colombian white,

467
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,140
-阿富汗棕... -我们懂了 Sebastian
- your Afghan brown... - We get it Sebastian.

468
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:17,342
很多毒品
Lot of drugs.

469
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:20,111
500磅[约230千克] 几百万的市值
500 pounds, worth millions on the street.

470
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:21,613
这比Kelly从警方证物间拿到的
And it's much more than what Kelly got

471
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:22,914
要多得多
from the NOPD evidence locker.

472
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,349
你们得搜查整艘船
You need to search the ship.

473
00:18:24,351 --> 00:18:26,250
好吧 你要知道 说比做容易
Well, you know, that's easier said

474
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:29,187
你要知道这可是战略海运舰级别的船
than done, you know, 'cause this is a T-AKR class vessel.

475
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:31,589
也就是说 它有965英尺[约300米]长
That means it's 965 feet long,

476
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:33,824
40英尺[约12米]深 有3000个标箱的容量
it's 40 feet deep, it's got a 3000 TEU capacity.

476
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:33,824
{\an8}国际计量单位TEU(Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit),指长度为20英尺的集装箱{\r}

477
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,059
你自个儿算算
I mean, do the math, you know?

478
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:36,094
事实上 我正要算呢
Actually, I'm gonna do the math.

479
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:37,661
Sebastian
Sebastian.

480
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:38,963
晕船了吗
Seasickness getting to you?

481
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:40,331
事实上 你知道吗 不晕
Actually, you know what? No.

482
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,034
Tammy给了我一些超棒的中药
Tammy gave me some dynamite Chinese medicine,

483
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:44,768
我感觉太好了 简直棒极了
and I feel great; it's so awesome.

484
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,504
就是可能有点儿副作用
Just might be a side effect or two.

485
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,105
但我们现在有另一个问题
But we got another problem.

486
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,307
箱子是在海上被清空的
That crate was emptied while the ship was at sea.

487
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,543
意味着Kelly在船员里有内应
Means Kelly's got an accomplice on the crew.

488
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,277
找到同伙 你们就能找到毒品
Find the accomplice, you'll find the drugs.

489
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,212
有没有发现
Any luck figuring out

490
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:56,614
一开始是谁
who gave Kelly access

491
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:58,415
让Kelly拿到被没收的毒品
to the confiscated drugs in the first place?

492
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,385
我们有了一些想法
We got some ideas.

493
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,421
但还没有确认
But nothing confirmed yet.

494
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:06,123
这是非常复杂的一场行动
This is a sophisticated operation.

495
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,258
我们要在船到巴拿马运河前
We need to shut it down before that ship

496
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,726
把这事儿给解决了
makes the Panama Canal.

497
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:10,446
收到
Copy that.

498
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,795
你看到这个了吗 简直疯了
You seen this thing? It's nuts.

499
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:13,930
赶紧出去 别给我添乱
Get out of here. You're gonna get me in trouble.

500
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:19,903
你真的认为Richard Marino偷了毒品吗
You really think Richard Marino would steal drugs?

501
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:25,041
我原来的导师和搭档那个Marino么
The Marino that was my mentor and partner?

502
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:26,308
不
No.

503
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,977
他已经不是那个人了
But he's not that guy anymore.

504
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:30,413
喝酒是一回事
Well, the drinking's one thing.

505
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:32,148
我们现在说的是重罪
We're talking a major felony.

506
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,350
他承认是他签字将充公的芬太尼
Well, he admitted he signed for the confiscated fentanyl

507
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:36,052
进行销毁
out of evidence to be destroyed.

508
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:37,920
而现在毒品在那艘货船上
And now it's on that cargo ship.

509
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:39,221
如果是真的
If it's true,

510
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:41,424
Marino就是Kelly的同伙
Marino was in league with Kelly.

511
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:43,592
我们没找到他们之间的联系
And we have no connection between them

512
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:45,027
除了昨晚的抓捕行动
except last night's bust.

513
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:46,495
你可能没有找到联系
You might not have the connection,

514
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,797
但我有 跟我来
but I do. Follow me.

515
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:53,334
来吧 这里
<i>Here we go, right here.</i>

516
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:55,470
-Brian Cooper -谁是Brian Cooper
- Brian Cooper. - Who's Brian Cooper?

517
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:58,406
Brian Cooper 2010年从西部高中毕业
Brian Cooper graduated Western High School in 2010

518
00:19:58,408 --> 00:19:59,875
和Nathan Kelly一起
with Nathan Kelly.

519
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:01,910
他们一起参加棒球队 现在他们仍是
They played varsity baseball, and they're still part

520
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,078
夏季球赛联盟的一员
of a summer ball league together.

521
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,680
Copper和Marino有什么联系
What's Cooper's connection to Marino?

522
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:06,014
Copper在新奥尔良警方的
Cooper works the incinerator

523
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,249
焚化炉工作
for the New Orleans Police Department.

524
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,885
我们去拜访他
Let's pay him a visit.

525
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,288
干得好 P
Good work, P.

526
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:16,191
船上有上百个箱子
There are hundreds of crates on this ship.

527
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:17,392
我们没法在到达巴拿马运河前
There's no way we search them all

528
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:18,660
一个个搜查
before we reach the Panama Canal.

529
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:20,395
并且我们知道至少有一个船员
And we know at least one of the crew

530
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:21,897
涉嫌毒品走私
is involved in the smuggling operation.

531
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:23,498
没有人能够信任
No one can be trusted.

532
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,400
包括我们
Not even us.

533
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:27,368
啊 我开玩笑的 只是顺口一说
Ah, I'm kidding. I'm just going with a thing.

534
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,338
对不起 我完全相信你 就是...
I'm sorry. I totally trust you, just...

535
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,440
好吧 我大概率相信你 但你的表现
Okay, well, I mostly trust you, but you've been acting

536
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:33,774
-比往常更奇怪 -好吧
- weirder than usual. - Well, yeah.

537
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,910
是因为你给我的那些中药
It's these Chinese herbs that you gave me, you know?

538
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:38,113
让我感觉怪怪的 浑身紧张发痒
They're making me feel all wired and tense and itchy.

539
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:39,147
这正常吗
Is that normal?

540
00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:40,582
我就不应该给你
I should've never given them to you.

541
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:41,916
我挺喜欢的 你知道吗
I like it, though, you know?

542
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:43,584
我感觉我浑身是劲
I feel like I'm firing on all cylinders.

543
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:45,385
哦 很好 也许你能用这些干劲
Oh, good, well, maybe you can use those cylinders

544
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:48,355
让我们找到被藏的毒品
to lead us to where the narcotics are hidden.

545
00:20:48,357 --> 00:20:49,957
我开玩笑的 Sebastian
I was just kidding, Sebastian.

546
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,759
我们得用老办法
We have to do it the old-fashioned way.

547
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,327
一个个储物间去找
We need to check every locker.

548
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:54,629
不 不 我们不需要
No. No, we don't.

549
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:55,830
我们思路错了
W-We're thinking about this all wrong.

550
00:20:55,832 --> 00:20:57,832
为什么要把500磅毒品藏在储物室
Why hide 500 pounds of drugs in a locker

551
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,633
只是为了在到达港口前取出来
just to take them out before you reach port?

552
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:00,967
太冒险了 除非
It's too risky, unless...

553
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,737
他们一开始就没打算到港口
They were never meant to reach the port in the first place.

554
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:06,273
但是身处大海中央 你会把500磅毒品
But where do you get rid of 500 pounds of drugs

555
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:08,008
放在那儿呢 不能直接扔出船外吧
in the middle of the ocean? Can't just throw them overboard.

556
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,244
跟我来 我有个想法
Follow me, I got an idea.

557
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:12,212
-但会有一点臭 -臭
- But it's gonna be smelly. - Smelly?

558
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:14,080
等等 我们去哪儿
Wait, where are we going?

559
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:23,356
焚化炉在运行
Incinerator's going.

560
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:25,992
Copper一定在这里
Cooper must be here.

561
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,861
哦 Patton刚把所有关于Brian Copper的资料
Oh, Patton just sent me everything he's got

562
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,262
发给我了
on Brian Cooper.

563
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:30,764
他在焚化炉这里
He's been working the incinerator

564
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:33,566
工作了七年 为新奥尔良警方 州警
for seven years, destroying drugs for NOPD,

565
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,967
缉毒局销毁毒品
state police and DEA.

566
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:36,335
他有机会接触到许多毒品
Gives him access to a lot of narcotics.

567
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,703
有从中获利的机会
Opportunity to make a profit.

568
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:41,541
Brian Copper 联邦探员
Brian Cooper, federal agents.

569
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,509
我们得谈谈 开门
We need to talk. Open up.

570
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:47,112
门锁了
It's locked.

571
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,923
这不是烧毒品的味道
That's not drugs being burned.

572
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,561
哦 天啊
Oh, God.

573
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:13,838
哦 是Brian Copper
Oh, that's Brian Cooper.

574
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,173
Cooper
Cooper?

575
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:17,775
到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

576
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,847
上报情况 Chris
Call it in, Chris.

577
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:24,615
Rita
Rita.

578
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:26,584
嘿 Rita 听着 我...
Hey, Rita, listen, I...

579
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,019
马上来
I'm on my way.

580
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,521
还好吗
Everything all right?

581
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,556
她出车祸了
She got run off the road.

582
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:06,122
Rita
Rita?

583
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:09,359
Rita 你在吗
Rita, are you here?

584
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:11,193
Dwayne
Dwayne.

585
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:13,195
Rita
Rita.

586
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:14,864
没事了
It's okay.

587
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:16,031
我没受伤 我没事
I'm not hurt. I'm good.

588
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:17,933
哇哦 哇哦 哇哦 不 你在流血
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No. You're bleeding.

589
00:23:17,935 --> 00:23:20,435
我吗 哦 我...
I am? Oh, I... Oh.

590
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:22,471
一定是爬出来割到自己了 我
Must have cut myself getting out. I was...

591
00:23:22,473 --> 00:23:25,407
我跑得太快了 想要跑到安全的地方 我...
I just was moving so fast. I was trying to get to safety. I...

592
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:26,742
直接告诉我发生了什么
Just tell me what happened.

593
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:29,211
好吧 有辆卡车在我后面开得很快
Well, this truck came up behind me fast.

594
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:31,212
我想要让道 它一直跟着
I-I tried to move out of the way. It kept coming,

595
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:34,283
然后它撞了我 之后我记得的事情就是
and then just rammed into me, and the next thing I know,

596
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:35,584
我的车翻了
my car was flipped over,

597
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,085
然后卡车加速跑了
and then the truck was speeding away.

598
00:23:37,087 --> 00:23:38,654
你看到车牌号了吗
Did you get a look at the plates?

599
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:40,054
没
No.

600
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:41,856
但我见过这辆卡车
But I've seen the truck before.

601
00:23:41,858 --> 00:23:43,592
它之前跟踪了我一整天
It was following me.

602
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:46,194
在清水市 这不是一起意外
All day in Clearwater. This wasn't an accident.

603
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:48,897
你应该报警的
You should have called 911.

604
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:51,800
但如果你是对的 Hamilton是幕后黑手
But if you're right, and Hamilton's behind all this,

605
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:53,534
除了你我还能相信谁呢
how can I trust anyone but you?

606
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:55,170
也是
Yeah.

607
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,338
好了 来吧
Okay, come on.

608
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:03,377
这气味你说的没错
You weren't wrong about the smell.

609
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:05,379
你为什么觉得毒品在这里
Why do you think the drugs are here?

610
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:07,615
在船上 回收品被堆起来
Well, on a ship, recycling is stacked

611
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:09,550
然后分类 等着到港口卸货
and sorted to be off-loaded at port.

612
00:24:09,552 --> 00:24:11,452
但混合肥料会在船到达之前
But compost is dumped in the ocean

613
00:24:11,454 --> 00:24:13,153
被倒入大海
before the ship reaches its, uh, destination.

614
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:16,089
你觉得毒品会被倒掉么
You think the drugs are gonna be dumped?

615
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:17,725
是啊 然后被走私圈的某个人捡到
Yeah, and then picked up by whoever else is part

616
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,427
所以我们要把这里
of the smuggling ring, which means we have to search

617
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:20,961
所有的垃圾箱找一遍
all these garbage containers right now.

618
00:24:20,963 --> 00:24:22,562
来吧 让我们脏起来
Come on, let's get gross.

619
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:23,897
好的 我去那边
Okay, I'll be over here.

620
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:27,634
不管你信不信 这地方都排不上
Believe it or not, this doesn't even rank my top ten

621
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:30,304
我搜查过最脏地点的前十名
most disgusting places to search.

622
00:24:30,306 --> 00:24:33,440
外勤探员的特殊魅力生活啊
Glamorous life of a field agent.

623
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:42,081
Sebastian 我想我找到了
Sebastian, I think I hit pay dirt.

624
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:03,469
这是没有料到的
That was unexpected.

625
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,171
干得好 宝贝儿
You did great, baby.

626
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:06,705
你干的不错
You did great.

627
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:12,244
呃 以防万一 把他拷上吧
Uh, let's... put cuffs on him or whatever happens next.

628
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:14,145
这手铐够大吗
Do these fit him?

629
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:17,616
Loretta
Loretta.

630
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,618
啊 Dwayne也来了吗
Ah. Is Dwayne joining us?

631
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,553
没有 Rita出了点意外
No. Rita got in some kind of accident.

632
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:24,055
她没事 但为了安全起见 他把她带回NCIS了
She's okay, but he took her to NCIS to be sure.

633
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:25,357
好
Okay.

634
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,192
关于Brian Cooper 有发现什么吗
What can you tell me about Brian Cooper?

635
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,861
我可以告诉你 他不是活着被烧死的
Uh, I can tell you he wasn't burned alive.

636
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,863
死因是胸口的一处枪伤
Died of a single gunshot wound to the chest.

637
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,232
凶手想毁尸灭迹
Killer was trying to get rid of the body and evidence.

638
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:36,234
如果是这样 那他做得太差了
If he was, he did a poor job of it.

639
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:39,204
当药物焚烧炉加入其他物质时
A drug incinerator usually has an automatic cut-off function

640
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:42,573
通常会触发自动断电功能
whenever foreign materials are introduced.

641
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,909
所以我才能提取这些
And that's why I was able to recover these.

642
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,511
烧毁得差不多了
Pretty badly burned.

643
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:49,647
表面上的确如此 但是我从手套内部
On the outside, yes, but I pulled biologicals

644
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:52,283
提取出了生物组织
from the inside of the gloves.

645
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:56,788
Christopher 你可能不会喜欢我的发现
Christopher, not sure you're gonna like what I came up with.

646
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,036
难以置信
I can't believe it.

647
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:15,339
你居然带内务部来了
You called in the rat squad after all.

648
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:18,141
我太失望了
I'm so disappointed.

649
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,811
没什么比我现在的感觉更失望的了
Nothing compared to how I'm feeling.

650
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,780
你们看到了吗
You see this?

651
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,015
他们就是这样对待一位工作25年的老兵
This is how they treat a 25-year veteran.

652
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,517
不要再说谎了 Marino
No more lies, Marino.

653
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,785
你伤了我的心
You're breaking my heart.

654
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,822
没必要大吵大闹 Richard
No need to make a scene, Richard.

655
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,556
"没必要大吵大..." 我是在闹事么
“No need to make a Sc...” Me make a scene?

656
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,691
你们想干什么 因盗窃罪逮捕我吗
What were you gonna do, arrest me for theft?

657
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:39,028
不 因谋杀罪逮捕你
No. We're gonna arrest you for murder.

658
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:58,859
为什么给我看这个
Why am I looking at this?

659
00:26:58,948 --> 00:27:00,513
这是Brian Cooper
It's Brian Cooper,

660
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:04,150
新奥尔良市的焚烧炉操作员
incinerator operator for the City of New Orleans.

661
00:27:04,152 --> 00:27:05,652
你认为是我杀了他吗
You think I killed Brian?

662
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:07,019
我们知道是你干的
We know you did.

663
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:08,488
我为什么要这么做
And why did I do that?

664
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,723
为了一些芬太尼么
O-Over some fentanyl.

665
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:12,224
你们认为是我偷走了那些毒品
I supposedly liberated from evidence?

666
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:13,626
不仅仅是芬太尼
Not just fentanyl.

667
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:15,161
还有上百磅的其它毒品
Hundreds of pounds of other narcotics, too.

668
00:27:15,163 --> 00:27:17,897
你在毒品被销毁之前将其转移
You took the drugs before they were destroyed.

669
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:21,700
在港口交给Nathan Kelly 让他用船进行走私
Gave 'em to Nathan Kelly at the port to smuggle onto a ship.

670
00:27:21,702 --> 00:27:26,038
我看起来像是犯罪团伙的头目吗
Do I look like some sort of criminal kingpin?

671
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,806
我不再相信我看到的了
I don't know what I see anymore.

672
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:30,109
哈
Ah.

673
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:32,445
这么说 我让你失望了 是吗
So I'm a disappointment to you, hmm?

674
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,713
比失望严重多了
You're way past disappointing to me.

675
00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:36,648
你令我感到羞耻
All right, you're a disgrace.

676
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:47,593
我没有杀人 也没有偷东西
I didn't kill anybody, and I'm not a thief.

677
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:49,060
我们从尸体旁的手套中
We got your DNA

678
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:52,197
发现了你的DNA
off of gloves that were dumped by the body.

679
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,906
有人想陷害我 Chris
Someone's trying to frame me, Chris.

680
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:03,975
对 因为你从来不想为任何事负责
Yeah, 'cause you never take responsibility for anything.

681
00:28:03,977 --> 00:28:06,144
不 不 不 听我说 好吗
No, no, no, no, no. Listen to me, okay?

682
00:28:06,146 --> 00:28:08,112
我知道我做了很多不光彩的事
I-I know I do a lot of things.

683
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:09,313
我酗酒 我办案时
I drink too much, I'll cut corners

684
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:11,582
自作聪明 我对嫌犯拳脚相加
on a case, and I'll manhandle a suspect,

685
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:14,217
但不会 不会做这种事
but nothing... nothing like this!

686
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:16,285
-我们的时间不多了 -不会做这种事 Chris
- We don't have much time. - Nothing like this, Chris.

687
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,655
拜托 招了吧 Richard
Come on, do the right thing, Richard.

688
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:22,492
供出走私团伙的名单
Give me the members of the smuggling ring,

689
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:25,294
供出团伙中每一个人
every last one of 'em...

690
00:28:25,296 --> 00:28:27,931
或许我可以帮你说点好话
maybe I can cushion the blow.

691
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,071
你真想帮我吗
You want to help me?

692
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:37,140
先相信我说的话吧
You can start by believing me.

693
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:41,377
我不是你要抓的人
I'm not the guy you're looking for.

694
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,362
我尽力了 King
I tried, King.

695
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,798
他已经无可救药了
He's too far gone.

696
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,533
或许吧
Maybe.

697
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,401
但是事情有点奇怪
But there's something off here.

698
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:08,403
拜托
Come on.

699
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:10,672
你不会真相信他是被陷害的吧
You don't really believe he was set up.

700
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:13,641
这一切都太理所当然了
Everything's a little convenient--

701
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:15,777
Cooper的尸体 手套
Cooper's body, the gloves--

702
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:19,081
像是打包等着我们发现一样
like it's tied up in a bow for us.

703
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,482
那是因为Richard太草率了
Well, that's just Richard being sloppy.

704
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:23,851
不仅仅是这样
There's more.

705
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:26,320
跟我来
Come on.

706
00:29:26,322 --> 00:29:30,892
Patton分析了Kelly和Cooper的财务状况
Patton ran financials on Kelly and Cooper.

707
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:35,063
他们最近都有现金注入
Both of them had an infusion of cash recently,

708
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,265
但是Marino
but Marino...

709
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:39,733
身无分文
flat broke.

710
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:41,335
那是因为他很谨慎
That's just him being careful.

711
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:44,771
他到底是草率还是谨慎
Is he sloppy or is he careful?

712
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:47,241
好好想想
Think about it.

713
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,510
是他教会你如何成为一名警察
That's the man who taught you how to be a cop.

714
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:50,611
人是会变的
People change.

715
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:51,845
不会变化那么大
Not that much.

716
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:54,615
如果是我被抓进去审问
If it were me in the interview room,

717
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:57,050
我会不会得到无罪推定呢
would I get the benefit of the doubt?

718
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,492
Gregorio Sebastian 说说情况
Gregorio, Sebastian, tell me things.

719
00:30:05,494 --> 00:30:07,761
嫌犯名叫Mitchell Castor
Suspect's name is Mitchell Castor.

720
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:09,729
是船上的维修人员
He's the maintenance officer on the ship.

721
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,265
刚开始他拒绝开口交代 直到我威胁他
First, he refused to talk until I threatened to leave him

722
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:13,833
让他和Sebastian再来一个回合
with Sebastian for round two.

723
00:30:13,835 --> 00:30:15,801
听说你非常完美地
Heard you did quite a job

724
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:16,969
保护了你的搭档 Sebastian
backing up your partner, Sebastian.

725
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:18,371
我也不知道我怎么了
I don't know what came over me.

726
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:19,839
就像我有了超能力一样
It's like I had superpowers.

727
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:21,307
Mitchell Castor交代了什么
What did Mitchell Castor have to say?

728
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:23,343
是Kelly把他带进这次行动的
Well, Kelly's the one who brought him into the operation.

729
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:25,378
他们计划把毒品倒进海里
Plan was to dump the drugs in the ocean,

730
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,779
再用地理追踪器标记位置
marked with geotrackers,

731
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,648
之后买家就会坐小船来搜集毒品
then the buyers would collect them later in a small boat.

732
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,582
真是个逃避海岸警卫队和海军巡逻队的好办法
It's a good way to avoid Coast Guard and Navy patrols.

733
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:32,051
对 但今天早上
Yeah, well, until this morning

734
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:33,886
海岸警卫队抓获了买家
when the Coast Guard swept up the buyers.

735
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:35,387
他们是谁
And who are they?

736
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:36,822
墨西哥毒枭
Mexican drug cartel.

737
00:30:36,824 --> 00:30:38,758
他们买回被没收的毒品
They were buying back drugs that were confiscated here

738
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,760
重新分配毒品到新的地域
and redistributing them in new territories.

739
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:43,428
我们实际上发现了一个毒品回收的行动
Yeah, we essentially uncovered a drug recycling operation.

740
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,330
这需要现金以及缜密的计划
Well, it takes cash, planning.

741
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:47,199
嫌犯一条都不符合
None of our suspects fit the bill.

742
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,467
这肯定
There must be

743
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:49,535
牵涉到更大的人物
a bigger player involved.

744
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:51,270
Mitchell不知道谁是幕后黑手
Mitchell has no idea who's in charge,

745
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:53,405
但我们查了他的银行账户信息
but we did look into his bank account information.

746
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:55,807
对 一家公司一直在给他汇钱
Yeah, a company has been wiring him payments.

747
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:59,443
一家名叫"Audubon工业"的离岸公司
Uh, some offshore corporation called Audubon Industries.

748
00:30:59,445 --> 00:31:01,012
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

749
00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:03,181
你知道那家公司吗
That name mean something to you, King?

750
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:14,225
早上好
Good morning.

751
00:31:14,227 --> 00:31:16,594
对我来说是早上
Morning for me.

752
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:18,596
你肯定一夜没睡
Pretty sure you never came to bed.

753
00:31:18,598 --> 00:31:21,199
这个案子我走不开
This case is keeping me busy,

754
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:24,435
但是知道你在这儿平平安安的就好了
but I like knowing that you were up here... safe.

755
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:29,674
如果我不接受华盛顿的那份工作
Well, if I don't take that job in Washington,

756
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:31,342
我们可以经常这样
we could make it a habit.

757
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:32,810
我喜欢这种感觉
Ah, I like the sound of that.

758
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,615
好了 Audubon工业
Okay. Audubon Industries.

759
00:31:38,617 --> 00:31:40,584
又开始工作了 伙计
And he's back, folks.

760
00:31:42,188 --> 00:31:45,055
这家公司在清水市购置产业
Company's been buying up properties in Clearwater.

761
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:47,758
他们可能涉及我们调查的走私集团
Think they're involved in our drug smuggling ring.

762
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,426
关于这家公司 你还知道些什么
What did you learn about them?

763
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:51,728
不多 这是一家有钱的空壳公司
Not much. It's a glorified shell company.

764
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,230
他们的办公室空空荡荡
They've got an empty office,

765
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:55,532
事实上 只有一张桌子 一部手机
no more than a desk and a phone, really,

766
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:57,900
以及在清水市投资的几百万美元
and millions invested in Clearwater.

767
00:31:57,902 --> 00:32:02,572
资金来源可能是贩卖被没收的毒品
Yeah, probably financed from the sale of confiscated narcotics.

768
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:06,909
如果Hamilton和清水市有联系
And if Hamilton is connected to Clearwater,

769
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:09,078
他就肯定和贩毒集团有联系
he must be connected to the drugs.

770
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,313
他太聪明了 我们没有发现任何直接联系
He's too smart to have any direct contact.

771
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:13,783
所以呢 有人在替他卖命吗
So, what? Someone's working on his behalf?

772
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:16,986
你逮捕的缉毒队警察呢
That vice cop you arrested?

773
00:32:16,988 --> 00:32:19,222
Marino
Marino.

774
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:21,457
他这么多年来一直麻烦不断
He's been plagued by complaints for years.

775
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:23,225
很难相信Hamilton会信任他
Hard to believe Hamilton would trust him.

776
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:25,026
应该是那些毫无瑕疵的人
Prefer a partner beyond reproach.

777
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,962
这么说 我们要找的是另一名警察
So we're looking for another cop.

778
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:28,530
Hamilton熟悉的人
Someone who Hamilton knows well.

779
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:29,732
他们之间有过交集
Means they have history.

780
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:33,034
找到那个警察 我们就能扳倒Hamilton
Find that cop, we bring down Hamilton.

781
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,003
我去市政厅 申请调取
I'll go to City Hall and request

782
00:32:35,005 --> 00:32:36,605
警方的人事记录
NOPD's personnel records.

783
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:38,874
不不不 这不是个好办法
No, no, no, no, that's not a good idea.

784
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,108
你没有权利申请
Well, you don't have the authority

785
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,376
但我可以
to make the request-- I do.

786
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:43,845
昨天还有人在追杀你
Someone tried to kill you yesterday.

787
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:46,248
我是去市政厅 不是什么废弃的仓库
I'm going to City Hall, not an abandoned warehouse.

788
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,849
我并不需要征求你的同意
And I'm not asking permission.

789
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:49,350
好吧 好
Okay, well, fine, then.

790
00:32:49,352 --> 00:32:50,852
好 等我跟你一起去
Fine, then I'll come with you.

791
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:52,520
我也不是在征求同意...
And I'm not asking for permission eith...

792
00:32:56,293 --> 00:32:58,593
我不可不说 Rita
Man, I got to give it to you, Rita.

793
00:32:58,595 --> 00:32:59,994
你真是说话算话
You're as good as your word.

794
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:01,663
你把过去15年来
You got every file on every cop

795
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:03,931
进过缉毒队的警察档案都弄来了
who worked vice in the last 15 years.

796
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:06,434
我能说什么 我不接受否定的答复
What can I say? I don't take no for an answer.

797
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:08,436
有点像我的第二任前妻
Sort of like my second ex-wife.

798
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:10,305
但她对肯定的答复也不太在乎
Though she didn't care much for yes either.

799
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:11,471
我们在找
We're looking for any cop

800
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:13,373
与Hamilton有关联的警察
who has a relationship with Hamilton.

801
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,475
近一半的警察都与他有关联吧
Well, that's half the department, right?

802
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:18,312
他把自己当成是法律和秩序之友
He considers himself a friend to law and order.

803
00:33:18,314 --> 00:33:21,115
我们需要的不只是照片 我们需要深刻的关系 帮过忙的
We need more than photo ops. We need deep ties, favors done.

804
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:22,482
欠他人情的人
Someone who owes him.

805
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:25,119
一个被公共廉政组深查的警察怎么样
How about a cop who was in deep with Public Integrity?

806
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:27,387
我说的是 五年前
I'm talking about a confidential investigation

807
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:28,822
对于物证室毒品遗失的
into drugs that went missing

808
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:30,457
一次秘密调查
from the evidence locker five years ago.

809
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:31,991
这样的人怎么还能保住自己的工作
Well, how could he still be on the job?

810
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:34,661
毒品又神奇地出现了
Drugs magically reappeared in evidence.

811
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:36,129
多亏了Hamilton的一封信
Investigation never went public,

812
00:33:36,131 --> 00:33:37,664
调查从未公开
thanks to a letter from Hamilton,

813
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,033
他当时领导市议会的
who headed up the Criminal Justice Committee

814
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:42,235
-刑事司法委员会 -Marino吗
- for the city council. - Marino?

815
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:44,737
不是 是Jordan Spencer
No. Jordan Spencer.

816
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:47,506
为此他几乎丢了工作
He almost lost his job for it,

817
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:48,808
他还被指控了
and he went up on charges.

818
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,509
他现在负责整个缉毒队了吗
And now he runs the vice unit?

819
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:53,046
运气真不错
That is quite a change of fortunes.

820
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:54,780
Patton 查你该查的
Patton, ping whatever you got to ping,

821
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,316
追踪你该追踪的
trace whatever you got to trace.

822
00:33:56,318 --> 00:33:58,084
我们现在得找到Spencer
We got to find Spencer now.

823
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,186
他们就这么走了
And they're off.

824
00:34:01,188 --> 00:34:02,287
是的
Yeah.

825
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:04,790
我们做了所有的工作 他们享受了所有的乐趣
We do all the work, they have all the fun.

826
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,760
你有点想参加逮捕行动了吧
Kind of makes you want to tag along for the takedown.

827
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:09,595
不 我们只会碍事
Nah, we'd just get in the way.

828
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:12,398
让Pride多操心一件事
Give Pride one more thing to worry about.

829
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:26,178
发生什么事了
What's going on?

830
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,180
你被关在奥尔良监狱不好
You locked up in Orleans Parish is no good.

831
00:34:28,182 --> 00:34:29,514
太多人知道你在这里了
Too many people know you here.

832
00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:30,849
得到许可把你转移到
Got permission to transfer you

833
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,817
St. Charles街 直到事情解决
to St. Charles till this gets figured out.

834
00:34:38,926 --> 00:34:41,192
Spencer不在警局 Patton
Spencer wasn't at NOPD, Patton.

835
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:42,727
你查查他的位置
Where are you on his location?

836
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:44,562
查到了他的手机位置
I got GPS on his cell phone.

837
00:34:44,564 --> 00:34:46,631
Spencer刚离开了奥尔良监狱
Spencer just left Orleans Parish jail.

838
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:48,867
根据记录显示 他带走了Marino
According to the records, he got custody of Marino.

839
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:51,068
他会杀了Richard 让他当替罪羊
He's gonna kill Richard and make sure he takes the fall.

840
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,303
除非我们阻止他
Unless we stop him.

841
00:35:14,653 --> 00:35:17,560
你把自己搞得一团糟 Richard
You got yourself into a real mess here, Richard.

842
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:19,996
你知道我是清白的 对吗
You know I didn't do what they're accusing me of, right?

843
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:21,463
是 我们当然知道 Marino
Yeah, of course we do, Marino.

844
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:23,732
哪怕是你也不会做这种事
Even you're not that much of a screw-up.

845
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:27,503
Aubrey 把车停那儿
Aubrey, pull the car over here.

846
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,671
出什么事了
What's going on?

847
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:48,023
嘿
Hey!

848
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:50,091
你干什么 你在干什么
What are you, what are you doing?!

849
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:51,459
没有目击者
No witnesses.

850
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:52,994
从车里出去
Get out of the car.

851
00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:55,563
出去
Get out!

852
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,099
你疯了吧
You lost your mind?!

853
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:00,935
Spencer没有在移动了
Spencer is no longer on the move.

854
00:36:00,937 --> 00:36:02,169
他在高速公路边停车了
He pulled over off the highway.

855
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:03,704
我们需要一个确切的位置
We need an exact location.

856
00:36:03,706 --> 00:36:05,071
有条交支路
There's an access road.

857
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:07,741
精确定位他的位置
Zeroing in on his precise coordinates now.

858
00:36:07,743 --> 00:36:09,108
你杀了他
You shot him!

859
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,244
不 是你开的枪 Richard
No, <i>you</i> shot him, Richard.

860
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,279
在你设法摆脱手铐之后
After you managed to get out of your cuffs.

861
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:14,280
你疯了
You're out of your mind!

862
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:15,916
交易的代价
Cost of doing business.

863
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:18,318
转身 Richard 给你一个痛快的
Turn around, Richard! This'll go fast.

864
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,385
去你的
Screw you.

865
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:30,263
-掩护我 -好
- Cover me! - You got it.

866
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:38,871
结束了 Spencer 马上放下武器
It's over, Spencer! Drop it now!

867
00:36:38,873 --> 00:36:40,238
放下武器
Drop the weapon!

868
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:49,247
-Richard 你还好吧 -是 是 是
- Richard, you all right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

869
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,283
Spencer
Spencer.

870
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:54,186
嘿 嘿 Spencer 你会没事的
Hey, hey, Spencer. You're gonna be all right.

871
00:36:54,188 --> 00:36:56,588
Chris 打911 快
Chris, call 911. Hurry.

872
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,922
Spencer 我们要跟你做笔交易
Spencer, we're gonna cut you a deal.

873
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,924
一笔交易 你懂吗
A deal, you understand?

874
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,994
你会没事的 好吧 然后你就能
You're gonna be all right, all right, and then you're gonna

875
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:03,295
跟我说说 你就能告诉我
talk to me, and you're gonna tell me

876
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:04,296
关于Hamilton市长的一切
everything about Mayor Hamilton.

877
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:06,031
好吗 我们要捉拿他
All right? We're gonna take him down.

878
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:08,133
你要帮我逮捕他 你明白吗
You're gonna help me take him down, you understand?!

879
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:09,434
Spencer
Spencer!

880
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,969
你明...
You underst...

881
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:13,337
Spencer
Spencer!

882
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,690
与Hamilton相关的唯一线索断了
Our only link to Hamilton is dead,

883
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:35,826
我们又回到了原点
which puts us back at square one.

884
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:37,794
不一定
Not necessarily.

885
00:37:37,796 --> 00:37:39,430
我们有关于Audubon工业的线索
We got a link to Audubon Industries.

886
00:37:39,432 --> 00:37:41,765
通过贩卖毒品获利
Taking profit from selling illegal drugs

887
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:43,267
在清水市购买房产
to buy property in Clearwater.

888
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:45,002
尽管如此 但还是与Hamilton没有关联
Still no connection to Hamilton, though.

889
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:47,170
老兄 这满满的负面情绪是怎么回事
Dude, what's with all the negativity here?

890
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:48,438
对不起 我不清楚
I'm sorry. I don't know.

891
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,073
只是 我觉得我从某种快感中
It's just, I feel like I'm coming down

892
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:51,508
平静下来 你了解吗
from a high or something, you know?

893
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,076
肯定是Gregorio给我药的缘故
Must be the pills that Gregorio gave me.

894
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:55,245
Sebastian 你不是从快感中平静下来
Sebastian, you're not coming down from a high.

895
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:57,280
没事的 好吗 我没怪你
It's okay, all right? I don't blame you.

896
00:37:57,282 --> 00:37:59,516
只是我的身体是一个微妙的生态系统
It's just that my body is a delicate ecosystem.

897
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:02,318
好吧 那些药
Okay, so the pills...

898
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,787
根本不是中药
were not even Chinese herbs.

899
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:08,791
常规抗过敏药 非处方药 不是外国产的
Regular allergy medicine, over the counter, nothing exotic.

900
00:38:08,793 --> 00:38:09,792
老兄
Dude,

901
00:38:09,794 --> 00:38:11,261
你吃了安慰剂
you got placebo'd.

901
00:38:09,794 --> 00:38:11,261
{\an8}安慰剂，一种不含有效成分的“模拟药物”{\r}

902
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:12,762
稍等 好吧
Hold on, all right.

903
00:38:12,764 --> 00:38:15,198
等一下 我不是晕船
Wait a minute. Now, I wasn't seasick.

904
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,499
-对 -我不是紧张
- Right. Mm. - I wasn't nervous.

905
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:19,735
但我搞定了那家伙
But I-I kicked that guy's ass.

906
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:21,336
是的 的确如此
Yeah, you did.

907
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:23,205
就是这样 没有药物帮助
That's right, no special drugs.

908
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:26,208
只有法医探员Lund
Just Forensic Agent Lund.

909
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,644
你是说
So what you're saying is...

910
00:38:28,646 --> 00:38:30,379
我很了不起
I'm kind of awesome.

911
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:32,281
好了 我要走了
Okay, that's my cue to go.

912
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:33,534
等等 你能不走吗 不要离开我
Wait, can you not? Don't leave me.

913
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:34,484
不
No.

914
00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:36,218
嘿 要不这样 你上Twitter
Here, how about this? How about you go onto Twitter,

915
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,153
发推 带标签"Sebastian真了不起"
and you tweet: hashtag “Sebastian's awesome”?

916
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:40,089
现在你就是这么想的 你在想我很了不起
Now you're thinking it. You're thinking I'm awesome.

917
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:42,157
你正在想"Sebastian真了不起"
I mean, you're thinking “Sebastian's awesome”"

918
00:38:51,902 --> 00:38:54,002
我不确定你会来
I wasn't sure you was coming in.

919
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:55,570
我刚在医院看Roger
I was at the hospital seeing Roger.

920
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:56,738
是吗 他怎么样了
Yeah? How's he doing?

921
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,840
他最终会痊愈的
He'll be good, eventually.

922
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:00,341
你在这做什么
What are you doing here?

923
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:02,811
Pride和我刚完成了这个案子
Pride and I was just wrapping up the case.

924
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:04,178
听着 我
Listen, I...

925
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,880
如果你要道歉 就免了吧
If you're gonna apologize, don't.

926
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:09,183
你没什么需要道歉的
You got nothing to be sorry for.

927
00:39:09,185 --> 00:39:11,685
你做了你的本职工作
You did your job,

928
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:13,721
救了我的命
and you saved my life.

929
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:16,424
尽管如此 我给你带来的麻烦
Still, what I put you through...

930
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:17,558
不 Chris
No, Chris.

931
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,327
我糟透了
I'm a mess.

932
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,962
已经有很长一段时间了
Have been for quite a while now.

933
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,434
你知道 事情不是非得变成这样的
You know it doesn't always have to be like that.

934
00:39:27,436 --> 00:39:30,604
把这当成一记警钟
Consider this a wake-up call.

935
00:39:30,606 --> 00:39:32,640
是时候做些真正的改变了
Time to make some real changes.

936
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:39,113
你知道吗 自从你逮捕我以后 我就没喝过酒
You know, I haven't had a drink since you arrested me.

937
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,548
这很好
That's good.

938
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,916
是 是
Yeah. Yeah.

939
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:47,454
如果需要什么就联系我 好吗
I'm here if you need anything, all right?

940
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,789
看看你 都长大了
Look at you, all grown up.

941
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,725
我是认真的 Richard
I mean it, Richard.

942
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:55,295
我也是
Me, too.

943
00:39:57,065 --> 00:39:59,165
我也是
Me, too.

944
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,284
我很高兴你还在这儿
I'm glad you're still here.

945
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:22,254
你刚到 又一次
And you're just getting in-- again.

946
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:26,425
是啊 关于Spencer的死有很多要总结
Yeah, well, a lot to wrap up with Spencer dead.

947
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:28,794
很遗憾你没能活捉他
Yeah, sorry you couldn't take him alive.

948
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:31,596
但是你会找到另一种方法去扳倒Hamilton
But you'll figure out another way to get to Hamilton.

949
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,132
不是我 是我们
Not me. We.

950
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,367
我们是个很好的团队
We're a great team.

951
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:39,171
我们只需要把Hamilton与Audubon联系起来
We just need to tie Hamilton to Audubon,

952
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:42,440
我有很多想法
and I got a couple ideas how.

953
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:44,642
我们吃早饭的时候聊聊
What do you say we hash 'em out

954
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:45,776
你看怎样
over breakfast?

955
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,312
之后呢
And then what?

956
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:51,148
在夜里你又冲出去 而我等在这
You rush off into the night again, while I wait here?

957
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,518
你在这里是安全的 Rita
Well, you're safe here, Rita.

958
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,421
我是个检察官 Dwayne 我要打头阵
I'm a prosecutor, Dwayne. I lead the charge.

959
00:40:56,423 --> 00:40:59,457
而不是留守在家等待
I don't stay back and keep the home fires burning.

960
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,760
Hamilton的案子比你之前的案子更困难
Well, Hamilton's different than any case you've ever had.

961
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:05,395
好吗 我不想让你发生意外
Okay? And I'm not gonna let anything else happen to you.

962
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:09,166
我不想担心自己的安全
I don't want to worry about my safety,

963
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:10,901
我也不想你来担心
and I don't want you to, either.

964
00:41:15,942 --> 00:41:17,574
这是什么
What's this?

965
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,445
这是华盛顿的爵士乐俱乐部清单
It's a list of jazz clubs in D.C.,

966
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:24,814
乐师可以在任何一个周日的晚上去那里客串参演
where musicians can sit in any Sunday night.

967
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,953
这是你想要的吗
Is that what you want?

968
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:32,155
不确定这是不是我想要的
Not sure it's what I want,

969
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:36,126
但这是我需要的
but... it's what I need.

970
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:38,527
听着 我们不是小孩子了
Look, we're not kids anymore.

971
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,029
我们不会一时头脑发热
We don't rush in head first.

972
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,965
我们有自己的生活和事业
We've got lives and careers.

973
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:44,167
我们需要花费精力去经营
Whatever we're doing here deserves attention.

974
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,568
我有集中精力 Rita
I'm paying attention, Rita.

975
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,103
我知道你有
I know you are.

976
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:50,173
但你需要把全部精力花费在扳倒Hamilton上
But you need your full focus to go after Hamilton.

977
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:54,477
你不用担心我
You don't need to worry about me.

978
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:58,714
抓住他 Dwayne 之后一切都结束了
Take him down, Dwayne, and get closure.

979
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:02,618
当一切都结束的时候 我在华盛顿等你
And-and when you have, I'll be in D.C.

980
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,954
我不相信我们不得不结束
I'm not convinced that we have to end this.

981
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:10,025
不是结束 只是暂停
Nothing's ending, we're just hitting pause.

982
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,727
就像是个自由延长记号
It's like a fermata.

982
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,727
{\an8}五线谱中记号{\r}

983
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,933
我不会让它终止的
I'm gonna hold you to that.
