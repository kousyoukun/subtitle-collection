148
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,011
我尽量不要让这个想法分散我的注意力
I'm trying not to let that idea distract me.

149
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:46,545
你的注意力已经被分散了 Dwayne
You're already distracted, Dwayne.

150
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,014
FBI的审查
The FBI review.

151
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:52,352
没错 与其说审查不如说是一场联合攻击
Yeah. Not so much a review as a coordinated attack.

152
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,052
你一定会圆滑地处理
Well, sure you handled it diplomatically.

153
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:55,488
我确实是
I did.

154
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,191
直到Isler开始对Merri指指点点
Until Isler started pointing fingers at Merri.

155
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:01,259
就把她当替罪羊了
Used her as a scapegoat, then?

156
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:02,628
你怎么处理的
How'd you handle that?

157
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,463
不那么圆滑 那是肯定的
Not diplomatically, that's for sure.

158
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,231
太抱歉了 我很抱歉
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

159
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,733
我已经能等多久等多久了
Uh, I waited as long as I could.

160
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:09,167
我知道你们在进行私人对话
I know you're having a private conversation.

161
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:10,798
我只是 我必须来拿受害者的个人物品
I just... I got to get the victim's personal effects.

162
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:11,609
没关系 Sebastian
It's okay, Sebastian.

163
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:13,072
那太好了 因为我实在太想知道了
Okay, great, 'cause, look, I'm dying to know:

164
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:16,174
牵扯进这个案子的是那个Elvis Bertrand吗
is <i>the</i> Elvis Bertrand involved in this case?

165
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:18,010
-你认识他 -我 我倒是希望能认识他
- You know him? - Well, I-I wish.

166
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:20,112
他就像 他就像是黑客之星
He's like the... he's like the hacker of the people.

167
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:22,747
他黑进公司内网
He breaks into corporate computer networks,

168
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:24,116
然后公布所有见不得人的交易
then he releases all their dirty laundry.

169
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:25,384
他简直是我心目中的英雄
He's a personal hero.

170
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:27,685
有那样的特长会树敌很多 Sebastian
Made a lot of enemies pulling those stunts, Sebastian,

171
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:31,188
包括司法部门
including the Justice Department.

172
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,425
为了免除牢狱之灾
Got himself banned from using the Internet

173
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:37,595
他被禁止使用网络 但他无视了这个禁令
instead of jail time... a ban he ignored.

174
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:43,100
这声音是从物证中来的
That's coming from the evidence.

175
00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:47,038
Warbeck少校的手机
Commander Warbeck's phone.

176
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,305
嘿 给我个手套
Hey, give me a glove.

177
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:54,311
Elvis
Elvis?

178
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:56,213
这正是我喜欢你的地方 Dwayne 你接一个
That's what I love about you, Dwayne; you answer

179
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:58,482
死人的电话 但你就是知道是我打来的
a dead man's phone, and somehow you know it's me calling.

180
00:07:58,484 --> 00:07:59,850
跟他说我是他的粉丝
Tell him I'm a fan.

181
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:04,254
到底发生了什么
What the hell is going on?

182
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:06,590
我很想要坐下来边喝秋葵浓汤边和你说
Well, I'd love to sit and chat over a bowl of gumbo,

183
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:07,925
但在他们追踪到我的手机之前
but I got about 30 seconds

184
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:09,392
我只有三十秒
before they can track the phone I'm on.

185
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:10,594
他们是谁 Elvis
Who's they, Elvis?

186
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:11,862
呃 政府
Uh, the government,

187
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:14,965
私人调查员 那些人 还有你 据我所知
private sector, “the Man,” you, for all I know.

188
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,832
现在我们只剩20秒了
Now we got 20 seconds.

189
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,768
你听上去太偏执了
You're sounding paranoid.

190
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,870
如果是这些人在追踪我 这就不算偏执
Well, you're not paranoid if they are actually after you,

191
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:22,772
而且我的确是刚刚死里逃生
and I did barely survive a massacre.

192
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:24,407
我还有10秒钟 Dwayne
I got ten seconds, Dwayne.

193
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:27,410
我要你在四小时内与我见面 你一个人来
I need you to meet me in four hours... alone.

194
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:30,113

我还指望你把我的帽子带来呢
I was hoping you brought my hat,

205
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:10,451
因为 我跟你讲 我不喜欢我头上这玩意
'cause I tell you, this thing on my head ain't working.

253

因为你把他吓走了
'Cause you scared him off.

254
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:15,450
难道我要在以谋杀罪逮捕他之前
Was I supposed to say “pretty please”

255
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:16,685
说几句求求你么
when I arrested him for murder?

256
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,020
那就是NOLA的做事方法吗

Elvis有很多身份 但不是杀人犯

Elvis和我的小组的审查一点关系都没有
Elvis has nothing to do with my team's review.

261

你到底在这干什么

这镇子比我记忆中还小

人们总会遇到的

265
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:35,003

266
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:36,938
哦 所以你也不是什么都知道
Oh, so you <i>don't</i> know everything.

267
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,940
你想再来一个惊喜吗

00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:46,480
我应该认识吗
Should I?

270
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:49,017
我还以为你认识这镇上的每个人呢
Figured you knew everyone in this town.

271
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,485
Elvis的后备箱里有个死人

272
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:53,587
你再说一遍他不是个杀人犯

275
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:03,431
所以这是NCIS的事儿 不是你的
That's NCIS's stake here. Not seeing yours.

你对水下光纤电缆了解多少
What do you know about underwater fiber-optic cables?

279
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,272
我也一无所知
I know squat, too.

280
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,842
只知道他们传输着各种各样的敏感数据

283
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:19,747

286
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,087
我们一直在监视光缆上的秘密交易
We've been monitoring the transactions on the cables.

287
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:28,955
结果发现 不只我们一家在监视
Turns out, we're not the only ones.

288
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:33,025
你认为Natal Cartel黑进了光缆吗
You think the Natal Cartel is hacking these cables?

289
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,461
你正因为贩毒集团双重间谍一事
You're under review regarding

290
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,995
而被调查
a cartel double agent.

291
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:38,498
你得退出 让机动部队来处理这事
You need to step off and let the cavalry handle it.

292
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,666
我手上有一名死亡的海军军官
I got a dead Navy officer.

293
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:41,668
你的手下是首要嫌疑目标
Your buddy's the prime suspect.

294
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,737
再提醒一次 你在接受审查
Again, you're under review.

295
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:46,873
是啊 但没那么容易
Yeah. Not that easy.

296
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:53,279
在你或者你那"机动部队"误杀Elvis之前
I'm gonna go find Elvis before you or your “cavalry”

297
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:55,547
我会找到他
put a bullet in him by mistake.

298
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:59,118
说的对
Fair enough.

299
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:11,697
Loretta女士
Miss Loretta.

300
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,766
我想要最近一位受害者的尸检结果
Hoping to get autopsy results on our latest victims.

301
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:15,200
不只你想要

几分钟前拿着许可证
came a few minutes ago with a warrant,

304
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:19,637
把受害者
and they're taking the victims

305
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,639
和我的验尸结果一起带回了他们的实验室
and my results back to their crime lab.

306
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,275
Elvis车里那个无名氏也带走了吗
Even the John Doe from Elvis's car?

307
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:25,310
他们让我停手之前
I barely had time to photograph the body

308
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,478
我都来不及给尸体拍照
before they told me to cease and desist.

309
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,948
我不喜欢半途而废
I hate leaving something undone.

310
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:36,020
吱
Psst.

311
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:37,655
过来
Come over here!

312

我有东西给你们
I have something for you.

313
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,793
但我不想他们知道
But I don't want them to know,

314
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:43,461
让我们低调一些 好吗
so let's be inconspicuous, okay?

315
00:13:43,463 --> 00:13:44,929
大家表现的自然点儿
Everyone just act normal.

316
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:47,598
Sebastian 你现在比刚才
Sebastian, you couldn't look more conspicuous

317
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,233
还要显眼
than you do right now.

318
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:51,768
你查到了什么 老兄
What you got, my brother?

319
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,904
我在Warbeck少校的个人物品里找到了这个
I found it in Commander Warbeck's personal effects.

320
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:56,006
像是门卡 那种
Looks like a key card that you find in a...

321
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:57,241
恩
Mm...

322
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:58,909
看上去是不是很像办公室或者酒店里用的
Looks like a common key card

323
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,179
很普通的门卡 不是的
that you'd use in any office or hotel, right? Wrong.

324
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:03,513
我试着分析了一下芯片
Tried to analyze the chip.

325
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:05,482
它的加密算法的安全标准仅次于
Encryption is, like, next-level secure,

326
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:06,817
国家安全局
only available to NSA,

327
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:07,884
中情局
CIA...

328
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:09,218
真的 所有带A的缩写词
Really, any of the “A” acronyms.

329
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,620
那就说得通了
Well, that makes sense.

330
00:14:10,622 --> 00:14:12,989
Warbeck曾为水下光缆
Warbeck was working a cyber security project

331
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,624
做过网络安防工程
on underwater fiber optics.

332
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:16,893
嘿 你要是能找出这个卡来自哪里
Hey, you figure out where that key card comes from,

333
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:19,463
你就能给我们提供Warbeck被害的线索了
you can give us the lead on why Warbeck was killed.

334
00:14:19,465 --> 00:14:20,730
说起来容易 做起来难 但是Patton和我
Easier said than done, but Patton and I

335
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:22,298
潜心研究 破译了这玩意儿
got down and dirty, and we decrypted this bad boy.

336
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,732
结果发现 这个卡属于某个叫Certel的公司
Turns out, it belongs to some company

337
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:25,601
这公司和政府有合约
called Certel-- contracts with the government.

338
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,603
我不清楚 Pride正往那里赶
I don't know-- Pride's on his way there right now.

339
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,105
不 我的理解是
No, it's my understanding

340
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:31,074
我们不参与这件案子
that we aren't on this case.

341
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,509
或者我们可以把FBI的命令当耳旁风
Or are we taking the FBI order as optional?

342
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:35,878
Pride肯定当耳旁风了 我们得帮他
Well, Pride sure is, and we got his back.

343
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:37,746
{\an8}[注：“Pig Latin” 密语]

346
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:41,350
你们现在有空吧
Got some free time on your hands?

347
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:44,453
不妨回FBI 把谈话结束
Why not come back to the FBI, get your interviews over with?

348
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:48,657
我以为FBI在处理

追踪到了这儿 Certel公司

353

354

Warbeck少校负责什么
And Commander Warbeck's role?

357
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:06,274
Henry是来做威胁评估的国防部联络员
Henry was DoD liaison for Threat Assessment.

358
00:15:06,276 --> 00:15:07,809

359
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:18,185

363
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:24,726
我们的职责嘛
It's our business.

364
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,865
额
Uh...

00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:35,002
我们最近都有点紧张

366
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:41,175
你和Warbeck少校工作关系很好吗

我们共同管理这个部门两年了

Warbeck少校遇害
Commander Warbeck's murder

370
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:53,319
或许和他在这儿的工作有关

371
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:54,922
他说的没错

还有敏感的政府谈话

375
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:05,432
Henry觉得他发现了一个监视软件

376

在光缆上有一个虚拟窃听器

378
00:16:08,437 --> 00:16:10,203
用于窃听数据

他没有上报过关于黑客的事

做这个事情的人很厉害

Henry需要确认
Henry needed confirmation,

382
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:17,243
所以他去找了他觉得他能信任的人
so he went to the one person he thought he could trust,

383
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:18,244
Elvis Bertrand

他们一起服役过

他是Henry见过的最厉害的黑客

386
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:25,618
有可能
It's possible

387
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,987
是有人背叛了Certel公司
whoever breached Certel

388
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:30,389
意识到Warbeck少校正在查这事

389
00:16:30,391 --> 00:16:31,991
为此便杀害了他

390

391
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,229
什么都不知道
Nothing.

392
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:39,131
你得和Elvis谈谈

他是唯一一个能够搞清楚这个漏洞的人

394
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,138
Patton 请告诉我你已经追查到了Elvis
Patton, please tell me you've tracked down Elvis.

395
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,173
你哥们Elvis很牛掰
Oh, your buddy Elvis is scary good.

396
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,741
他开机打几个简短的电话
He turns his phone on long enough

397
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,776
然后关机
to make short calls, and then he powers it down.

398
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:52,978
所以 没发现
So, no luck.

399
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,245
嘿 我也很不错

400
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,914
我不得不跑出来 移动追查
I had to hit the streets and go mobile.

401
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,983
我不能告诉你他手机现在在哪儿
I can't tell you where his phone is,

402
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,318
但我能告诉你它曾经在哪儿
but I can tell you where it was.

403
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,787
自从谋杀案开始 Elvis就从城市公园的某处
Ever since the murders, Elvis has been making several calls

404
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,355
打了几通电话
from somewhere in City Park.

405
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,992
Elvis一直对旋转木马情有独钟

00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,529
哦 我以为你知道呢 LaSalle和Sonja脱不了身
Oh, I thought you knew. Lasalle and Sonja's tied up.

408
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,265
就在我们说话的同时 FBI在审讯他们呢
The FBI is interviewing them as we speak.

409
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,375

Guess I know what a high colonic feels like now.

410
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,809
他们问你Merri的事情了吗
They ask you about Merri?

411
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,945
对 她和Russo的关系
Yeah, and her relationship with Russo.

412
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,780
持续了多久 关系有多亲密
How long it was, how intense.

413
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,382
我是否信任她 废话 我当然信任她
Did I trust her? Yeah, I trust her.

414
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,317
对 比这些蠢货们更值得新任
Yeah, more than these “feeb” jokers.

415
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,286
他们也问了我King的事情
They asked me about King, too.

416
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,656
他有破坏协议的习惯吗
Did he make it a habit of breaking protocol?

417
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,891
听着 Isler将阻止恐怖袭击
Look, Isler's gonna make stopping a terrorist attack

418
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:45,828
变成实施恐怖袭击  把我们都坑惨了
into an actionable offense, hanging us all out to dry.

419
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,664
我想知道
I want to know.

420
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,865
你干嘛呢
What are you doing?

421
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,134
那边有情况
There's something going on over there.

422
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,502
我没听到太多
I couldn't catch a lot of it.

423
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,305
很多低声的对话 但
A lot of whispered conversation, but...

424
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,007
我觉得他们发现了Elvis
I think they got a line on Elvis.

425
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:00,843
那让我们查个明白
Well, let's find out.

426
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:02,779
你要跟踪她吗
You want to follow her?

427
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,214
你知道这会给我们带来多大的麻烦吗
You know how much trouble that's gonna get us in?

428
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:07,249
我们已经麻烦缠身了
We're already in trouble.

429
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,988
到处都没有Elvis的消息
No sign of Elvis anywhere.

430
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,790
我能告诉你的就是 你要找的人昨天
All I can tell you is your boy was clocking

431
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,591
在这里用了几小时做了些很重要的事
some serious hours around here yesterday.

432
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:17,693
据我目前所知 他现在可能在古巴
Far as I know, he can be in Cuba by now.

433
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,395
Patton
Patton?

434
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:21,129
Patton 你能听到吗
Patton, you there?

435
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:24,800
不 不 是我 Fidel Castro 我黑进了你们的通话
No, no, it's me, Fidel Castro, hacking in.

436
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:27,002
我断掉了Patton的线路
I disconnected Patton.

437
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:29,238
虽然你的人竟能追踪到我 令我印象深刻
Although I am impressed that you boys actually tracked me down.

438
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,506
我们该好好谈谈了
We got a lot to talk about.

439
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:34,342
Certel公司光缆的破坏
Breach of the Certel fiber-optic cables.

440
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,411
你后备箱里的尸体
Dead body in your trunk.

441
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:37,913
是啊 是他活该
Yeah, well, he had it coming.

442
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:39,380
他杀了Henry和其他人
He killed Henry and the others.

443
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:41,416
你知道 他们可能确实是扑克玩的很烂
You know, they might have been bad poker players,

444
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,284
但是他们不该为此而死
but they did not deserve to die.

445
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:45,954
别再开玩笑了 这次是认真的
No more jokes. This is serious.

446
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:47,888
他也想杀我
Well, he tried to kill me, too.

447
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,458
真他妈的走运 我活下来了 没让他得逞
And, dumb luck, I survived and he didn't.

448
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,228
相信我 兄弟 我没有在开玩笑
And trust me, brother, I'm not laughing.

449
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,830
听着 我需要知道真相 Elvis
Look, I need the truth, Elvis.

450
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:58,199
Warbeck少校有没有因为Certel公司的问题
Did Commander Warbeck come to you for help

451
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:00,801
向你寻求过帮助 还是因为这件事就是你做的
on the Certel breach or because you were involved?

452
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:02,737
你觉得我会做那样的事吗
You think I'd do something like that?

453
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,338
你之前做过的 Elvis
You have before, Elvis.

454
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,209
好吧 说得对 说得对 我是做过 但是
Okay, good point, good point, I have, but...

455
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:10,410
这次我学聪明了 不会再次被抓了
I am too smart to get caught twice.

456
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:15,049
旋转木马 真的吗
Carousel? Really?

457
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:17,051
你要当面跟我们说清楚
You got to come in.

458
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:18,786
那么FBI就可以拿我当替罪羊了
So the FBI could scapegoat me,

459
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:21,755
就像他们拿你和你的团队当替罪羊一样
like they're scapegoating you and your team.

460
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:24,258
等一下 Elvis
Wait a minute, Elvis.

461
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,092
你黑进了FBI吗
Did you hack the FBI?

462
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:27,827
嗨 这是公平的反击
Hey, turnabout's fair play, man.

463
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:30,397
顺便提醒你一下 哥们 你也是他们的目标
And by the way, you are in their crosshairs, too, brother.

464
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:32,899
FBI认为你是凶手
FBI thinks that you're a killer.

465
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:36,102
他们现在就想把你带走
They will not hesitate in taking you out.

466
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:39,005
因为我是不会进监狱的
They're gonna have to, because I'm not going to prison.

467
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:40,173
Elvis
Elvis...

468
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:49,249
Elvis
Elvis.

469
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:51,050
回头见 Dwayne
See you around, Dwayne.

470
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:52,085
他不
He's not...

471
00:19:55,256 --> 00:19:56,455
是我 Christopher
Yeah, Christopher?

472
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:58,056
我刚从FBI出来
Just got out of the FBI.

473
00:19:58,058 --> 00:20:00,058
我很确信Tammy有了Elvis的线索
Pretty sure Tammy's got a lead on Elvis,

474
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,394
所以我们正在跟踪她
so we're kind of following her.

475
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:03,962
但是如果你不希望这样 我们可以退出
But we will stand down if you want us to.

476
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:05,130
不
No.

477
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:07,600
不 继续跟着 不管发生什么
No, keep on it, whatever happens.

478
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:12,237
我们必须在FBI找到Elvis之前找到他
We got to get to Elvis before the FBI does.

479
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:15,107
他不会让FBI活捉他的
He won't let them take him alive.

480
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:31,076
你一定要小心谨慎 Christopher
You need to be cautious, Christopher.

481
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:32,777
如果被Tammy发现你在跟踪她
If Tammy realizes what you're doing,

482
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:34,546
那么一切就都完了
all hell will break loose.

483
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:35,780
有情况随时跟我汇报
Keep me updated.

484
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:37,749
听上去情况不是太好
Sounds like you're up to no good.

485
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:40,085
Lasalle和Sonja正在尾随
Lasalle and Sonja are tailing the FBI agent

486
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:43,421
调查我们的FBI探员 希望她可以带他们
investigating us, hoping that she will lead them

487
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:46,557
找到我那在逃的朋友
to my fugitive friend.

488
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,693
真是太糟了
No good at all.

489
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:50,361
这不算什么
That's nothing.

490
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:52,930
我试图去证明Certel公司的光纤
Has me trying to confirm that Certel's fiber optics

491
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,332
确实是被人黑进去过
were being hacked.

492
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:55,699
于是我违反了数十条联邦法律
I'm breaking a dozen federal laws

493
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:57,101
黑进了Certel公司的光纤
hacking them myself.

494
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:59,170
FBI根本不在乎Warbeck少校的死
FBI doesn't care about Commander Warbeck's murder.

495
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:00,438
他们只想知道是否
Only want to prove that there's

496
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,341
真的有什么黑帮阴谋
some sort of a cartel conspiracy.

497
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:05,576
-为什么不让他们自己折腾呢 -我不能
- Why not let them flounder? - I can't.

498
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:08,379
这样的代价是 Elvis会被
Odds are, Elvis will get himself killed.

499
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:11,381
真正的犯罪嫌疑人或是FBI杀掉的
By the actual suspects or the FBI.

500
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:13,216
你有发现些什么吗 Loretta
You got something, Loretta?

501
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:17,287
哦 FBI拿走了我们的证据
Oh. The FBI took our evidence, uh,

502
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:20,724
但是我好像是忘记把Elvis后备箱里
but I may have neglected to give them

503
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:23,961
那具尸体的照片给他们了
the photos of the body found in Elvis's trunk.

504
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:25,428
就是Elvis说的那个
The man he said was responsible

505
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,164
谋杀扑克室三人的人吗
for the three murders in the poker room?

506
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,199
此刻我对你充满敬意 Loretta
Brimming with respect for you right now, Loretta.

507
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:30,367
可我没有时间
Didn't have time

508
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:32,735
去做适当的尸检
for a proper autopsy,

509
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:35,605
更没有指纹或DNA
let alone fingerprints or DNA.

510
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:37,307
但是我有这些
But I have these.

511
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:39,876
粗糙的 简单墨水印
Crude. Improvised inks.

512
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:41,678
是 像是在监狱里画的那种
Yeah, something you'd get in prison.

513
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,414
这些刺青表明了他所效力的组织团伙
These tattoos highlight the gangs he ran with.

514
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,150
就像是简历一样
It's like a resume.

515
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:49,819
Sebastian外出做了些调查 找到了这个人的身份
Sebastian did some legwork, came up with this I.D.

516
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:52,655
Max Connor
Max Connor.

517
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:54,657
坐过十年牢
Serving ten years.

518
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,325
抢劫 严重伤害罪
Robbery, aggravated assault.

519
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:58,360
普通的坏蛋
Common crook.

520
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:00,762
不是那种能做高级黑客的人
Not the type to get involved in high-level hacking,

521
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:02,831
更别说是当贩毒集团的雇佣兵
let alone a cartel soldier.

522
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,400
FBI的理论根本讲不通
Blows up the FBI theory.

523
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:06,735
他必须要有同伙
He had to have had an accomplice.

524
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:08,637
这个人要精通电脑
Someone with computer skills.

525
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:11,407
或者是有权限接触到Certel公司的人
Or someone with access to Certel.

526
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:14,776
好吧 我做些了调查
Uh, well, I-I did a little digging.

527
00:22:14,778 --> 00:22:17,679
结果发现 Max Connor有个兄弟叫James
And turns out, Max Connor has a brother James.

528
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:21,482
他是Certel公司的技术人员
He's a technician contracted with Certel to run

529
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:23,785
为他们的水下光缆工作
their underwater cable.

530
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:25,187
他对工程知识
He had inside knowledge

531
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:27,055
有很深的了解
of the engineering.

532
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:29,257
我们这里还有位"神探南茜"啊
Regular Nancy Drew over there.

533
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:32,260
我想知道他现在在哪
I want to know where he is right now.

534
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:33,994
马上就找到 我这就打开他手机上的GPS
Way ahead of you. I'm-a pull up the GPS

535
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:35,330
我们会找到他的
on his phone, we'll find him.

536
00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:49,777
看吧 我告诉过你 你离她太近了
See? I told you, you're getting too close to her.

537
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:52,078
你什么意思 我离她有两个车的距离
What do you mean? I'm two car lengths behind.

538
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,614
我知道怎么跟踪嫌犯
I know how to follow a suspect.

539
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:56,015
但她不是嫌犯 她是FBI
Yeah, but she's not a suspect, she's FBI.

540
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:58,918
如果她发现了我们 我们将失去唯一能找到Elvis的线索
If she makes us, we lose our only lead on Elvis.

541
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,654
也可能失去我们的工作
Probably our jobs.

542
00:23:00,656 --> 00:23:02,122
是的 所以安静点
Yeah, so be quiet.

543
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:04,157
-哦 是你应该安静点 -相信我
- Oh, you be quiet. - I got this.

544
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,369
真见鬼
Dad-gummit.

545
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:17,904
啊 我告诉过你的
Ugh, I told you.

546
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:20,539
-她发现我们了 -她没有
- She made us. - She did not.

547
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,743
好吧 我想我们就在这等着 看她有没有发现
All right, well, I guess we'll just wait here and find out.

548
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,449
嗨
Hey.

549
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:33,486
好吧 够了
All right, enough.

550
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:35,020
我们得谈谈了
We got to talk.

551
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:36,789
不要否认 不要跟我绕弯子
No denials, no deflections.

552
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,024
自从我们在Russo的案子后抱过彼此
You've been acting weird toward me ever since we hugged

553
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:40,225
你的举止总是怪怪的
after the Russo case.

554
00:23:40,227 --> 00:23:42,094
我们有过那一刻
And... we had a moment.

555
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:45,297
行了 我要在这里打断你了
Okay, I'm just gonna stop you right there.

556
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,400
因为 是的 我们同意不谈这件事
'Cause we agreed we're not talking about this.

557
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:50,202
因为我们之间没什么
'Cause we're cool.

558
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:51,804
因为都是过去的事了
'Cause that's bygones.

559
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:52,871
我们很不自然
We're anything but cool.

560
00:23:52,873 --> 00:23:55,340
我们应该是一个团队

and trust each other; I can't even reach for my water

562
00:23:58,211 --> 00:24:00,111
你都要把手弹开

563

You're a jackass! You freakin' follow me, too?!

不袖手旁观和阻碍公务之间
Well, there's a line between not standing down

635
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:41,029
是有界限的 不容跨越
and obstruction; and it's not a fine one.

636
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:43,798
如果不是因为我们 就不会在查Certel的时候
Wasn't for my team, we would not I.D. James Connor

637
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,467
认出James Connor 并阻止他

638
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:47,669
在这里枪杀Gregorio探员

嘿 如果我们错了呢

688
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,129
如果我们的案子
What if the breach had nothing to do

689
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,232
和间谍行动以及贩毒集团无关呢
with the espionage or the cartels?

690
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,133
如果这只是一场简单的银行抢劫案呢

696
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,350
但证据正好相反
But the evidence looks bad.

697
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,453
你自己不解释 我也没法帮你
Got to explain yourself or I can't help.

698
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,023
好吧
Okay.

699
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:33,128
我能要一碗秋葵吗
Can I get a bowl of gumbo?

700
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:35,764
听着 我没入侵任何人
Listen, I didn't hack anybody.

701
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:38,934
Warbeck发现有人入侵Certel
Warbeck found a sniffer down at Certel.

702
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:41,402
有人把数据从服务器上传了出去
Someone had transferred data off the server.

703
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:45,006
-什么数据 -Elvis 什么样的数据
- What kind of data? - Elvis, what kind of data?

704
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:47,209
我不知道 但传到了一家投资银行
I don't know, but it went to an investment bank.

705
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:49,410
IDI银行
IDI Bank.

706
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:50,846
因为Ciudad Natal贩毒集团的事情
Under Justice Department investigation

707
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,948
正在被司法部调查
for working with the Ciudad Natal Cartel.

708
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,549
包括其他几千名客户
And about a thousand other clients.

709
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:55,750
重点是
The point is

710
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:57,485
Warbeck没法进行追踪 所以我帮了他
Warbeck couldn't trace it, so I helped him out.

711
00:30:57,487 --> 00:31:00,154
-他找了个被判重罪的罪犯帮忙 -他找了位朋友帮忙
- He came to a convicted felon. - He came to a friend.

712
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:01,522
他想知道到底是外来的攻击
He wondered if it was an attack

713
00:31:01,524 --> 00:31:03,124
还是内部有人在捣鬼
from the outside or an inside job.

714
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:04,225
他是怎么做的
And how exactly could he do that?

715
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:05,627
你知道吗 我可以给你解释
You know, I would explain it to you,

716
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:07,328
但你还是听不懂
but you still would not understand it.

717
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,597
试试看 额
Try and, uh...

718
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,000
解释得简单点吧
Try and dumb it down for me.

719
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:15,702
Warbeck把损坏的数据给了我
Warbeck brought me the corrupted data.

720
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:18,773
我检查了所有日志 寻找黑客的蛛丝马迹
I went through the logs looking for the hacker's signature,

721
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:21,809
因为他们通常会留下一些数据痕迹
because they almost always leave a digital trace.

722
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:24,544
直接跳到三人打牌被杀的部分
Skip to the part where three men end up dead at the poker game.

723
00:31:24,546 --> 00:31:26,380
我们经常一起打牌
We played poker together all the time.

724
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:28,415
我在那里是去告诉他们我的发现
I was there to tell them what I'd found.

725
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,484
不幸的是 有人在跟踪我们
Unfortunately, someone was tracking us.

726
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:32,653
Max Connor 就是死在你后备箱的那个人
Max Connor, who was found dead in your car trunk.

727
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:35,021
没错 他杀了他们 也想杀死我
Right, he killed those guys, and he tried to kill me, too.

728
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:37,190
-但我很幸运 -或者他是你的同伙
- And I got lucky. - Or he was your partner,

729
00:31:37,192 --> 00:31:39,993
还有他在Certel工作的兄弟James
along with his brother James, who worked at Certel.

730
00:31:39,995 --> 00:31:42,162
你入侵了服务器 当Warbeck听说此事时
You hacked the servers. When Warbeck got wind of it,

731
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:44,164
-你就杀了他 -别像个白痴一样
- you had him killed. - Don't be an idiot!

732
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,331
我根本没有做这种事
I had nothing to do with it.

733
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,233
我是在帮我的兄弟 好吗
I was helping out my buddy, okay?

734
00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:49,035
而且我会帮你们找到黑客
And I'll bring you your hacker, all right?

735
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,804
不论他是内部的人 还是外部的人
Whether he's on the inside or the outside.

736
00:31:50,806 --> 00:31:53,673
但你得让我进入Certel的服务器
But you got to let me on Certel's servers.

737
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:55,541
这样你就能删掉所有证据了吗
So you can clear any damning evidence?

738
00:31:55,543 --> 00:31:57,043
别妄想了 Elvis
Don't hold your breath, Elvis.

739
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:58,644
愚蠢至极
So stupid.

740
00:31:58,646 --> 00:32:01,980
Dwayne 我向上帝发誓 我说的是事实
Dwayne, I swear to God, I'm telling the truth.

741
00:32:01,982 --> 00:32:04,216
而且我保证字字属实
And I can back up every word of it.

742
00:32:04,218 --> 00:32:06,485
Henry给我的那些文件
Those files that Henry gave me

743
00:32:06,487 --> 00:32:08,521
隐藏在我的笔记本电脑里
are hidden in my laptop.

744
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:10,022
去查吧
Check it out.

745
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:11,657
现在 我知道自己搞砸了
Now, I know I'm a screwup,

746
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:13,659
但是你很清楚
but you know damn well

747
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:17,595
我和你一样 想找到杀死Henry的凶手
I want to find the killer of Henry just as much as you do.

748
00:32:21,168 --> 00:32:22,500
怎么样
So?

749
00:32:22,502 --> 00:32:24,837
你从文件中发现了什么
What do the files tell you?

750
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,339
Certel的缺口有几百太字节
Hundreds of terabytes of the Certel breach.

751
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:28,874
主要是IDI银行的数据
IDI Bank mainly.

752
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:31,009
-和Elvis说的一样 -这证明了
- Just like Elvis said. - All this proves

753
00:32:31,011 --> 00:32:32,477
他有着被盗的数据
is that he had the stolen data.

754
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:34,045
被盗的数据 还有凶器
That and the murder weapon?

755
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:35,847
他得马上坐飞机回华盛顿
He's on the next plane back to D.C.

756
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:37,382
你没有考虑周全
You're not thinking this through.

757
00:32:37,384 --> 00:32:38,583
你还想保护你的朋友吗
You still trying to protect your friend?

758
00:32:38,585 --> 00:32:40,051
这算是新奥尔良的风格吗
Is this some kind of New Orleans thing?

759
00:32:40,053 --> 00:32:41,686
因为我完全不能理解
Because I don't understand it at all.

760
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:43,722
-看看清楚 -如果我相信Elvis有罪
- Open your eyes. - If I believed Elvis was guilty,

761
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:45,089
我早就行动了
I'd be leading the charge.

762
00:32:45,091 --> 00:32:46,991
我认为他是替Ciudad Natal做事
I say he's working for Ciudad Natal.

763
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:49,360
帮助他们暗中破坏我们对他们资金的调查
Helping them to undermine our investigation into their funds.

764
00:32:49,362 --> 00:32:51,628
这只是你的想法 但没有证据证明这是事实
Nothing to prove that except your desire for it to be true.

765
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,664
等我把他带回华盛顿 我会证明的
I'll prove it when I get him back to D.C.

766
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,566
你不了解新奥尔良
You don't understand New Orleans,

767
00:32:55,568 --> 00:32:58,602
但我了解华盛顿 在华盛顿 你的成就
but I understand D.C., and in D.C. you're only as good

768
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:00,004
只跟你最后的结果有关
as your last accomplishment.

769
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:01,138
什么意思
There a point?

770
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,439
如果你错了
If you're wrong here--

771
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:04,876
你确实错了 这就是职业生涯的结束
and you are-- it's career ending.

772
00:33:04,878 --> 00:33:06,243
你会像个傻瓜一样离开
You'll come off like a fool.

773
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,011
你知道我说的没错
You know it's true.

774
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:09,346
但是
But?

775
00:33:09,348 --> 00:33:10,647
再等12个小时
Wait 12 hours.

776
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:13,684
让我们的人搜捕James Connor
Let our people track down James Connor.

777
00:33:13,686 --> 00:33:15,386
让Elvis进入Certel
Let Elvis into Certel,

778
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:16,687
检查他们的服务器
check their servers,

779
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:17,755
找到真正的黑客
find the real hacker.

780
00:33:17,757 --> 00:33:18,856
-要是他逃跑呢 -他不会的
- And if he runs? - He won't.

781
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,391
我用我的职业生涯做赌注
I'll stake my career on it.

782
00:33:20,393 --> 00:33:23,093
如果他不能证明黑客的存在
And if he can't prove the hacker's still out there,

783
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:25,862
我会和你一起把他押送到华盛顿
I'll escort him to D.C. with you.

784
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,634
我们在你的手机上安装了无线设备
We got wires hooked into your cell phone.

785
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:32,835
你能通过耳机听到我们的指示
You'll be able to hear us through this earwig.

786
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:34,971
另外 我连上了大楼所有的
Plus, I have a feed into the building's

787
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,007
监控摄像头 到处都是我们的眼睛
security cameras. We have eyes all over.

788
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:38,574
我会注视着你的一举一动
I'll be watching your every move.

789
00:33:38,576 --> 00:33:39,975
反正你们联邦探员
Well, I figure you Feds have been

790
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:40,976
这么多年一直都在盯着我
doing that for years, anyways.

791
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,278
一旦你不按计划行动
The minute you go off book,

792
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,746
我就立即停止 重新拘捕你
I pull the plug and you're back in custody.

793
00:33:43,748 --> 00:33:44,980
他不会私自行动的
He's not going off book.

794
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:49,184
嘿 不要私自行动 好吗
Hey, don't go off book, okay?

795
00:33:54,025 --> 00:33:55,991
你过于相信人了
You got a dangerous amount of trust in people.

796
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,593
除此之外 我不知道还有什么方法
I don't know how to do it any other way.

797
00:33:58,595 --> 00:34:00,729
是啊 这次失败的话 咱俩都完蛋
Yeah, this goes wrong, we're both screwed.

798
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:02,611
你会惹上比我的审查更大的麻烦
You'll have much bigger problems than my review.

799
00:34:05,268 --> 00:34:06,868
什么都不要担心
Don't worry about anything.

800
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,702
只要让我进入服务器
Just get me into the servers.

801
00:34:07,704 --> 00:34:09,538
-我来完成剩下的部分 -Anne

802
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,206
没想到下班了还会在这里见到你
Didn't expect to see you here after hours.

803
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,206

00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,341
维护人员

00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,576
空调坏了
Problem with the air conditioning.

806
00:34:14,578 --> 00:34:16,611
不能让硬盘的温度太高
Got to keep the hard drives cool.

807
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:27,556
他们进去了 到现在为止 一切顺利

808
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:37,999
刚刚发生什么了
What just happened?

809
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,167
不是我们这边的问题
That's not on our end.

810
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:40,568
有人切断了信号
Someone cut the feed.

811

在Connor的电脑上有发现
Got something off Connor's computer.

James Connor's on his way, if he's not here already.

814
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,144
有人给了他进入Certel的安全密码

815

他在楼上Certel的办公室
He's up in Certel's offices.

817
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:08,415
监控信号被切断了 很可能是Elvis做的
Security feed got cut, probably by Elvis.

818
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:10,116
他耍了我们 Pride 他和Connor是一伙的
He played us, Pride. He's working with Connor.

819
00:35:10,118 --> 00:35:12,485
我们现在还不清楚
We don't know anything right now.

820
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:14,620
你们去找Connor 我去保护Elvis
You find Connor. I'll secure Elvis.

821
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:16,456
明白
You got it.

822
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:18,158
我打电话叫支援

823
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,126
好主意
Good idea.

FBI派我来的
The FBI sent me here.

826
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:23,964
你不会有事的
You'll be okay.

827
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:26,833
记住 我们这么做是为了Henry
Remember, we're doing this for Henry.

828
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:32,705

834
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,894
我要自己解决"
I'm handling this myself."

835
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:55,961
这话什么意思
What does that mean?

836
00:35:55,963 --> 00:35:57,162
意思是替Connor做事的人
It means whoever's working

837
00:35:57,164 --> 00:35:59,231
已经进入Certel了
for Connor is already in Certel.

838
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:00,732
有发现吗
Any luck?

839
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:02,100
入侵服务器的人
Whoever breached the servers

840
00:36:02,102 --> 00:36:04,503
很好地掩盖了他们的痕迹
did a good job of covering their tracks.

841
00:36:04,505 --> 00:36:06,003
所以 你不能确定黑客的身份
So, you can't I.D. the hacker?

842
00:36:06,005 --> 00:36:08,105
不 我可以
No, no, no, I can,

843
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:10,574
但这个黑客是从内部入侵的服务器
but the hacker scrubbed the servers from the inside,

844
00:36:10,576 --> 00:36:12,309
所以是Certel的员工
so it was a Certel employee

845
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:15,646
对这台电脑
with complete security clearance...

846
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:18,282
有完全的安全权限
from this computer.

847
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,455
你隐藏得很好 Anne
You're very good, Anne.

848
00:36:27,592 --> 00:36:29,326
显然还不够好
Clearly not good enough.

849
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:30,994
不过你会帮忙的
But you're gonna help.

850
00:36:30,996 --> 00:36:32,896
清除我入侵服务器的所有痕迹
Erase any signs that I hacked the server.

851
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:34,697
你杀了我的朋友
You killed my friend.

852
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:36,466
我不会这么轻易删除的
I don't make them too easy.

853
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:38,168
我不会帮你逃脱的
I'm not gonna help you get away with it.

854
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,969
-你没有选择 -要是我有呢
- You don't have a choice. - Hell if I don't.

855
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:45,207
Elvis
Elvis!

856
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:46,242
不要阻止我 Dwayne
Don't try to stop me, Dwayne.

857
00:36:46,244 --> 00:36:47,310
你要想清楚
You need to think this through.

858
00:36:47,312 --> 00:36:49,412
她杀了Henry和另外两个人
She killed Henry and the other two men.

859
00:36:49,414 --> 00:36:50,880
还想毁灭证据
Tried to cover her ass.

860
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:52,582
我认为她是间谍之类的
Thinks she's some kind of spy or something.

861
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:54,250
她不是间谍
She's not a spy.

862
00:36:54,252 --> 00:36:56,919
她只是入侵了IDI银行偷钱
She just hacked into the IDI Bank to steal money.

863
00:36:56,921 --> 00:36:58,587
我什么都没做
I didn't do any of it.

864
00:36:59,457 --> 00:37:01,523
Elvis
Elvis...

865
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:03,225
你知道我的
you know me.

866
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:04,760
我爱Henry
I loved Henry.

867
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:06,562
收起你的眼泪和谎言吧
Stop with your tears and your lies,

868
00:37:06,564 --> 00:37:08,331
因为没人会相信它们的 好吗
'cause nobody believes them, okay?!

869
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:11,300
我发誓 我没想让他受伤
Oh, I swear. I didn't want him to get hurt.

870
00:37:11,302 --> 00:37:12,968
杀他是他们的主意
It was their idea to kill him.

871
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,536
陪审团不会信的
Hard to sell to a jury.

872
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:16,438
我就是陪审官
I am the jury.

873
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:18,474
Elvis
Elvis,

874
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:20,676
你真的需要好好想想
you need to think this through.

875
00:37:20,678 --> 00:37:24,245
扣动扳机 你就毁了自己的生活
Pull that trigger, you're throwing your life away.

876
00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:26,081
Henry值得我伸张正义
Henry deserves justice!

877
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,816
这不是正义 这是报复
This isn't justice. It's revenge.

878
00:37:28,818 --> 00:37:31,086
说辞不同罢了
Those are just words.

879
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:33,288
不止是说辞
More than that.

880
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,123
让她面对自己的所作所为
Make her face what she's done.

881
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,557
付出代价
Pay the price.

882
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,360
在阴冷的监狱度过余生
Cold cell for the rest of her days.

883
00:37:38,362 --> 00:37:39,594
是她总比是你好
Better her than you.

884
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:41,929
没有人会进阴冷的监狱
Nobody's gonna spend any time in a cold cell!

885
00:37:41,931 --> 00:37:43,798
这把枪里有很多子弹
There's a lot of bullets in this gun!

886
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,632
不
No.

887
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:46,667
Henry是我唯一的朋友
Henry was my only friend!

888
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:50,505
唯一的朋友
Only friend?

889
00:37:59,348 --> 00:38:01,915
你说的对
You're right.

890
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:04,551
她不值得我这么做
She's not worth it.

891
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:24,004
Isler副主任
Assistant Director Isler.

892
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,039
让我想想
Let me see.

893
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,441
Anne Foreman被联邦拘留了
Anne Foreman's in federal custody.

894
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:30,476
Elvis所有的不法行为都会被清除
Elvis is gonna be cleared of all wrongdoing.

895
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:34,947
我想你来这里 另有他事吧
I'm guessing you're here on some other matter.

896
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,416
嗯
Mm...

897
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:39,552
虽然我还是不能认同你的方法
I... can't fathom your methods down here,

898
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:40,819
但令我印象深刻的是
but I'm impressed.

899
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:42,655
你和你的团队完成了工作
You and your team got the job done.

900
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:44,524
我们在
Just like we did

901
00:38:44,526 --> 00:38:46,392
John Russo一案中也是如此
in the John Russo case.

902
00:38:46,394 --> 00:38:47,860
好吧 我建议你们
Well, I advise you to follow protocol

903
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:49,862
下次遇到John Russo这种人 还是按规章办事
next time you come across someone like John Russo,

904
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:53,131
但我找不到理由责罚你们团队中的任何人
but I see no reason to penalize anyone on your team.

905
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:56,569
FBI对NCIS的审查结束
The FBI review of NCIS is closed.

906
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:57,937

00:38:57,939 --> 00:39:00,505
所以 你也要坐飞机回华盛顿了
So, you're on a plane back to D.C., too.

908
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:01,707
事实上 非也
Actually, no.

909
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,341
我们没有理由追查NCIS
There's no reason to pursue NCIS,

910
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:04,643
但仍有证据显示
but there's still evidence

911
00:39:04,645 --> 00:39:06,979
Ciudad Natal在新奥尔良仍然活跃
Ciudad Natal is active in New Orleans.

912
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:08,213
你们没有财力和
You just don't have the money

913
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,981
硬件技术去对付他们

914
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:11,683
我们呆在这里直到他们消失
We stay until they're gone.

915
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:17,155
哈哈 我能看得出来 你们都吓到了
Well, I can just, I can tell that you're all thrilled.

916
00:39:17,157 --> 00:39:18,290
不如说
Let's just say

917
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:20,325
我们希望你们尽快把他们清理掉
we look forward to you clearing them out fast.

我们私下谈一谈吧
let's talk privately.

920
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:27,632
好啊
Sure.

Butch. Sundance

你觉得他是什么意思
What do you think that's about?

923
00:39:35,008 --> 00:39:36,373
不知道 不关心
Don't know. Don't care.

924
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,742
我要走了
I'm out of here.

925
00:39:39,946 --> 00:39:41,212
嘿 Percy
Hey, Percy.

933
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:21,417
这种风格很吸引我隐藏的本性
You know, it's got a style that appeals to my seedier nature.

934
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,286
我应该说声谢谢
Thank you, I think.

935
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,454
音乐很棒
Music is great.

你得认识下Quincy 你的手臂怎么样了
You got to know Quincy. How's your arm?

938
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,593
我都不需要它 这才是我啪啪啪用的手
I don't even need it. This is my lovemaking hand.

939
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,595
什么

940
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,830
-哇 -嗯

谢谢

FBI网络犯罪部向你敞开了大门

949
00:40:51,948 --> 00:40:55,184
这意味着重返电脑 并且是合法地
Means getting back on the computer again-- legally.

950
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,786
哇 在"老大哥"的全天候监视下重返电脑
Wow, what an opportunity to be back on a computer

951
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,989
这真是一个好机会啊
with Big Brother watching my every move 24/7.

952
00:40:55,186 --> 00:41:00,989
{\a6}Big Brother：意欲控制人们思想行为的虚伪领导者

扮演好人不适合我 好吗

964
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:23,644
有多不愿承认

965
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:27,981

我跟Isler谈过了
Talked to Isler.

974
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:55,875
他说要我和你的团队一起工作
