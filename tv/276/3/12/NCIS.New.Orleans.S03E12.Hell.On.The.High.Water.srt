What are you doing?

18

我不是第一次入职了
Not my first rodeo.

19
00:01:25,906 --> 00:01:28,673
新人第一天上班总会被戏弄的
Day one on the job, newbie always gets hazed.

20
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:30,140
椅子坏了 桌子里有老鼠
Broken chair, rats in the desk

21
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:32,943
奶精里有泻药
Laxatives in the creamer.

22
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:36,580
你在FBI的同事都是反社会啊
What kind of sociopaths did you work with at FBI?

23
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:39,549
妹子 在贩毒集团的案子结束后
Girl, after everything that went down with the cartel,

24
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:41,352
我们要做好几天的文书工作
we got paperwork for days.

25
00:01:41,354 --> 00:01:43,120
没人有空来捉弄你
Nobody got time for hazing.

26
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:45,022
但要恭喜你通过了FLETC的训练
Congrats getting through FLETC, though.

00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:57,000
Gregorio
Gregorio!

30
00:01:58,669 --> 00:01:59,668
耶
Yeah.

31
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,537
你真该看看自己的表情
You should have seen your face.

32
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,939
我们把你骗得那么好
Yeah, we got you so good.

33
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:05,540
NCIS特别探员Gregorio
NCIS Special Agent Gregorio,

34
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,210
我们用新奥尔良山核桃派切片
we'd like to officially welcome you to our team,

35
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,512
正式欢迎你加入我们团队

也欢迎来到这座城市

我很感谢
I appreciate it.

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,317
还有以后记住 我讨厌惊喜
And for future reference, I hate surprises.

39
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,618
你讨厌乐趣
So you hate fun.

40
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,920
惊喜不是乐趣
Surprises aren't fun.

41
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:19,354
如果我不能嗅出惊喜
And I'm not much of an agent

42
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:20,889
我就不能算是一名探员
if I can't sniff out a surprise.

43
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,358
这个嘛 我们还有一个惊喜给你
Well, we got one more for you.

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,627
我们知道 你有多想戴上这个
We know how badly you've wanted to wear one of these,

45

46
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,663
-帽子 -帽子
- ...a hat. - ...a hat.

47
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:32,233
-NCIS团队的官方帽子 -哇哦
- Official NCIS team hat. - Whoo-hoo.

48
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,467
-我一定要戴吗 -当然
- Do I have to? - Yes.

49
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,403
现在就戴上
Put it on right now.

50
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,371
-让我们看看 -很漂亮
- Let me see. Yeah. - Oh, that's nice.

51
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:38,972
哦 看看这喜悦之情
Oh, look at the happiness

52
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:41,574
从帽子里溢出来了
pouring out of the hat.

53
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:44,911
我觉得自己做了件错事
I think I made a mistake.

54
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:46,746
工作时间到
Time for work.

55
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:48,415
Jay Nielsen上尉的尸体
The body of Lieutenant Jay Nielsen was just

56
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,882
刚在墨西哥湾被钓上来
fished out of the Gulf.

57
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:52,618
这会儿已经在Lorreta的解剖台上了
Landing on Loretta's table as we speak.

58
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,988
Sonja 你跟我去验尸房
Sonja, you're with me at the morgue.

59
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,823
Lasalle和Gregorio
Lasalle and Gregorio,

60
00:02:57,825 --> 00:03:00,725
去Nielsen上尉最近去过的地方调查
dig into Lieutenant Nielsen's recent whereabouts.

61
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:04,029
查出他怎么最终死在了水里
Find out how he ended up in the drink.

62
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:05,931
哦 你这个小探员
Oh, you, a little agent.

63
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:08,968
那好 我去联系
All right, so I'll contact

64
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,569
他的指挥官和亲人
his commanding officer, next of kin.

65
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,037
你去调查他的财政情况和通话记录
You take his financials and phone records.

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,873
怎么了
What?

67
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,141
我牙齿里有东西吗
Do I have something in my teeth?

68
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:18,977
-你在看什么 -没什么
- What are you looking at? - No.

69
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:21,479
Pride不在时 我资历最深
I'm ranking agent when Pride's not around,

70
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,780
应该是我发号施令才对
so I kind of call the shots.

71
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:24,582
得了吧 你是认真的吗
Oh, stop. Are you for real?

72
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:26,184
我知道你以前在FBI地位很高
I know you were a big deal in the FBI,

73
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:29,286
但在这儿你是新人 得服从团队规矩
but you're the newbie here, so gotta follow team rules.

74
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:33,290
啊 所以是我逾越规矩了么
Ah. So, uh, I jump on the paper trail?

75
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,627
是的 我去打电话
Yeah, and I'll make the phone calls.

76
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:35,193
行
Okay.

77
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:38,061
顺便说一句 帽子不错
That hat looks good, by the way.

78
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:49,805
有什么发现吗 Loretta
What have we got here, Loretta?

79
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:51,840
看上去像是
Something out of a Salvador Dali painting,

80
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:53,142
萨瓦多尔达利的画
it would seem.

81
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:53,142
{\a6}超现实主义画家

82
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:55,878
哇 我说
Wow! Shoot.

83
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,714
这不是鱼造成的吧
Um, guessing a fish didn't do that?

84
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:00,616
肯定不是
Most definitely not.

85
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:02,485
Nielsen上尉死于热冲击
Lieutenant Nielsen died of thermal shock.

86
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:04,852
由于某种很强的热量
His heart, lungs, bones literally melted

87
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:07,389
他的心脏 肺 骨头都熔化了
by some intense, concentrated heat.

88
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,957
哦 那个...
Ugh. Well, uh...

89
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,626
Nielsen在菲律宾驻扎了
Nielsen was stationed in the Philippines

90
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:14,162
六个月 两天前回来的
for six months, got back two days ago.

91
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:15,830
这次回家还真是不容易
This is a rough homecoming.

92
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:17,932
十分不容易 根据
Mm, very rough, and judging by

93
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:19,600
他脸上的瘀伤
the bruising on his face

94
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:21,268
和手上的防卫伤判断
and defensive wounds on his hands,

95
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,370
上尉当时打架是拼了命的
our lieutenant was in the fight of his life.

96
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:26,340
有可能是和烧伤他胸口的人打斗
Presumably with the person who burned in his chest?

97
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:27,474
嘿
Hey, uh,

98
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,842
Tammy和Lasalle查到了
Tammy and Lasalle got

99
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:30,511
Nielsen最后被看到的地方
Nielsen's last-known whereabouts.

100
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:32,612
在奥尔良码头 他们现在在去的路上
Orleans Marina. They're headed there now.

101
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:34,248
让他们去的时候带上你
Have 'em pick you up on their way.

102
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,083
去吧 了解情况
Go. Learn things.

103
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:40,238
知道是什么造成的伤害吗
Any idea what caused the damage?

104
00:04:40,262 --> 00:04:41,788
不知道
No.

105
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,323
而且查明的可能性不大
And the chances of finding out aren't favorable.

106
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:48,027
由于Sebastian在进行NCIS训练
With Sebastian getting his NCIS shield,

107
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,863
我只有一帮换来换去的临时助手
I get a revolving door of temps.

108
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:53,332
赶紧交差来了
Drop it like it's hot.

109
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,268
我测试了你送来的尸体样本 Wade医生
I tested the flesh sample you sent in, Doc Wade.

110
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,370
这家伙被火烧了
Dude was <i>torched.</i>

111
00:04:58,372 --> 00:05:00,905
这家伙有名字的 Nielsen上尉
The dude has a name-- Lieutenant Nielsen.

112
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:02,307
好吧 Nielsen上尉
Right, Lieutenant Nielsen.

113
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:04,443
天啊 这太狠了
Oh, man, that is gnarly.

114
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:05,710
Pride探员
Agent Pride,

115
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:08,913
认识下我们实验室技术人员 Claire Belcher
meet our lab technician, Claire Belcher.

116
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:12,283
她刚从新奥尔良科技学院毕业
She's just graduated from New Orleans Technical College.

117
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:13,884
这是她的第一份工作
This is her first job.

118
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:18,155
我以前从没看到过这样的东西
I have never seen anything like that before.

119
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:19,890
很高兴见到你 Belcher女士
Glad to meet you, Ms. Belcher.

120
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:22,893
你说Nielsen上尉被火烧了
You were saying Lieutenant Nielsen was torched.

121
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:24,395
知道是什么造成的吗
Any idea by what?

122
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:26,897
我想说 哇哦
I mean... wow.

123
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,431
他像是被熔化了
Like, he got melted.

124
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:31,934
是的 我们想知道是什么造成的
Yes. And we were wondering what did it.

125
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:35,171
我觉得...
I think, you know...

126
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,846
我想Sebastian了
I miss Sebastian.

127
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:45,981
-我知道为什么了 -嗯哼
- I see why. - Mm-hmm.

128
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:48,250
呃 我会联系FLETC
Uh, I'll reach out to FLETC,

129
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:49,951
把验尸报告给Sebastian
get Sebastian the autopsy report.

130
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:52,721
看他能否帮我们缩小凶器的范围
See if he can help us narrow in on the murder weapon.

131
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:55,324
你跟他谈的时候 让他打电话给我
When you talk to him, have him call me.

132
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:56,891
我很担心他
He's got me worried.

133
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,928
俯卧撑和障碍训练真的不是他的长项
Push-ups and obstacle courses aren't really his forte.

134
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,532
我会的 但我确信他肯定没事 Loretta
I will, but I'm sure he's doing just fine, Loretta.

135
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:08,769
加油 Lund 上 上 上
Come on, Lund, move, move, move!

136
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:10,104
行动
Let's go!

137
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:12,373
我只是... 你知道战逃反应吗
I just... You know “fight or flight”?

138
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:12,373
{\a6}指人在高压下，大脑调动身体作出攻击或逃跑的应激反应

139
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,575
其实还有第三种应激反应 叫"僵住"
Well, there's a third stress response-- it's called “freeze”"

140
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:18,513
这碰巧就是我正在经历的
And it's what I happen to be experiencing right now.

141
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:20,713
闭嘴 去敲铃铛
Shut up and ring the bell!

142
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,449
我只是 我看不出这个训练
I just... I don't see the practical application

143
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:24,284
有什么实际意义 长官
of this exercise, sir.

144
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:26,119
我是说 在真实场景中
I mean, in what real-world scenario

145
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:28,188
我会需要爬绳子吗
would I ever have to scale a rope, you know?

146
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,922
比如说 我要是在一艘海盗船上
Like, if I'm on a pirate ship?

147
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:31,758
等等 你要 要做什么
Wait, what-what are you doing?

148
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,693
这里没有位置了
There's no room at the inn!

149
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:35,728
两个人太挤了 你知道我的意思吗
Two's a crowd, you know what I mean?

150
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,130
天啊
Oh, God.

151
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,832
你在干什么 你在 呃
What are you doing? What... Uh.

152
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,270
等等
Wait...

153
00:06:44,272 --> 00:06:46,539
等等 等等 把它放回来
Wait, wait, wait. Put that back.

154
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,040
敲响铃铛
Ring the bell!

155
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,757
好了 好了 我做到了
Okay. Okay, I did it.

156
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,427
我敲了 拜托快把垫子放回去吧
I did it, now put the pad back, please.

157
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,506
我做到了
I did it.

158
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,541
如果完成不了 你就会摔断脚踝
You would have broken your ankle if you hadn't.

159
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:26,343
恐惧只能帮你到这 Lund
Fear only gets you so far, Lund.

160
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,277
如果你想当一名探员 最好能找到另一种方法
You want to make agent, you better find another way

161
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,978
来激励你爬上绳子
to motivate your butt up that rope.

162
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:38,120
Nielsen上尉的妻子说 他早早结束巡航回来
Lieutenant Nielsen's wife said he came home early from tour

163
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:40,423
为了带她参加在他们船上举行的周年航行
to take her on an anniversary cruise on their boat.

164
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:42,958
家住什里夫波特市 昨天开车过来做准备
Lives in Shreveport, drove down yesterday to prep.

165
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,892
接着就听到伤亡援助电话处上门的消息
Next thing she knows, CACO's at her door.

166
00:07:44,894 --> 00:07:46,394
留给她的是心碎
She's left with a broken heart

167
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:48,597
而他的丈夫是真的被烧死了
while her husband was literally melted away.

168
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:49,931
-女士优先 -哦 不
- Ladies first. - Oh, no.

169
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,966
你是资深探员 当然要你先
You're senior ranking agent. By all means.

170
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:53,801
话是没错 但我也是一名绅士
Well, that's true. But I'm also a gentleman,

171
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:55,237
所以您先请
so after you.

172
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,904
-哦 不 我... -听着 女士们
- Oh, no, I... - Look, ladies,

173
00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:59,140
你们都很漂亮 快走吧
you're both pretty-- let's go.

174
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:03,410
没有鸟屎 没有盐矿床
No bird poop, no salt deposits.

175
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,279
没有藤壶堆积
No barnacle buildup.

176
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,648
考虑到这艘船已经在这里停靠了六个月
Considering this boat's been sitting here for six months,

177
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,450
保持得还真好啊
it's in dang good shape.

178
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:11,652
好过头了 要检查检查
Too good. Check it.

179
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:14,304
你看到了这层新漆底下的黑点了吗
You see these black spots under this fresh coat of paint?

180
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,056
嗯
Mm-hmm.

181
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:17,224
这是蛋白质烟雾损伤
It's protein smoke damage.

182
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:19,525
我在ATF的在纵火案中见到过
Used to see it in arson cases with ATF.

183
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:21,861
当人身上着火的时候 脂肪和油脂
When the body catches fire, the fats and oils

184
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:23,763
就会化为烟并覆盖所有东西
turn into smoke and coat everything.

185
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:25,431
所以这些烟尘很有可能是
So this soot could be leftover residue

186
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:27,199
上尉胸口燃烧后的残留物吗
from our lieutenant's burning chest?

187
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:28,701
而且不管是谁烧伤了他
And it looks like whoever torched him

188
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:29,969
都曾试图刷漆 掩盖证据
tried to paint over the evidence

189
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:31,404
并清理了这艘船
and clean up the boat.

190
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:34,039
我想我们找到案发现场了
Think we might have just found our crime scene.

191
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,641
我有发现 你们需要过来看看
I got something y'all need to see.

192
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:39,878
Nielsen夫人说上尉是唯一一个
Mrs. Nielsen said the lieutenant was the only one

193
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,012
可以上船的人
who had access to the boat,

194
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:42,581
但我觉得她错了
but I think she was wrong.

195
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,082
看看这个
Look at this.

196
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:45,550
根据计时表来看
According to the hour meter,

197
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:48,553
在过去的六个月里
there's five trips, 12 hours each,

198
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:49,988
有五趟出行 每次12个小时
over the last six months

199
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,823
当时上尉是被派驻海外
while the lieutenant was stationed overseas.

200
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:53,223
有其他人在使用这艘船
Someone else was using the boat.

201
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,492
跟杀害他的是同一个人吗
The same someone who killed him?

202
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:56,360
上尉偶然发现了嫌疑人
The lieutenant stumbles on the suspect,

203
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:59,363
嫌疑人用喷枪烧伤了他 并把他丢进海湾
who proceeds to blowtorch him, dump him in the Gulf.

204
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:01,064
这么看来 很冷血啊
Now, that's cold-blooded.

205
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:02,566
不管罪犯用这艘船做了什么
Well, whatever the perp was using the boat for,

206
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:04,067
他都觉得这件事值得他杀人
he thought it was worth killing over.

207
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:06,337
我正在调出GPS行程记录
I'm pulling up the GPS trip history,

208
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:07,805
重播最后一次行程
replaying the last one.

209
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:19,683
这艘船开到石油钻塔去做什么
What was the boat doing out at an oil rig?

210
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,684
我不知道
I don't know.

211
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,051
但是这个偷船贼
But seeing as our boat thief

212
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:24,421
愿意用谋杀来掩盖他的行迹
was willing to murder to cover his tracks,

213
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:26,322
就不会是什么好事
it can't be good.

214
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:41,314
Apolis五号石油钻塔 离海岸200英里
Apolis oil rig 5. 200 miles off the coast.

215
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:44,450
每天运输2500桶原油
Pumps 2,500 barrels of crude a day.

216
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:47,053
这与海军上尉谋杀案有什么联系
What has it got to do with the murder of a Navy lieutenant?

217
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:50,156
还不清楚 但杀害Nielsen上尉的凶手
Well, no idea, but Lieutenant Nielsen's killer

218
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:52,691
偷了他的船 并在他被派驻海外期间
took his stolen boat out to that rig five times

219
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,460
五次去油塔
while he was stationed overseas.

220
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:57,363
长途用的油箱 增压的发动机
Long distance fuel bladders, super charged engine.

221
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:59,031
绝对是出行的最佳轮船
It's the perfect vessel for the journey.

222
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,532
现在就不是了 因为Nielsen撞见了嫌疑人
Not so perfect once Nielsen surprised the suspect,

223
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,202
并因此被点燃 然后抛尸在墨西哥湾
got lit up for his trouble and dumped in the Gulf.

224
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,171
一个拥有喷枪的凶手
A torch-wielding killer,

225
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,872
一艘被偷的船和一个海上石油钻塔
a stolen boat and an offshore oil rig.

226
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,474
有什么联系
What's the connection?

227
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,542
嗨 抱歉 电话回晚了
Hey. Uh, sorry it took me a little bit to call you back.

228
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,845
我一直在忙别的事儿
I've been... otherwise engaged.

229
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,947
我猜到了 训练情况还好吗
I bet. Training going okay?

230
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,449
哦 很好 很好 不能更好了
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Couldn't be better.

231
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,916
你知道的 结交一生的朋友
Uh, you know. Making life-long friends.

232
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:22,286
走上人生的巅峰 还是老一套
Achieving personal bests. The usual.

233
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,255
你有时间看我们发给你的尸检报告么
You find time to look at the autopsy report we sent?

234
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,424
有 有 我看了 而且我想我知道
Yeah, yeah. I did, and I-I think I know

235
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,893
Nielsen上尉是被什么杀害的
what killed Lieutenant Nielsen.

236
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,962
一切都还好吗 Sebastian
Everything okay, Sebastian?

237
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,031
当然了 很好 都很好
Oh, sure. Yeah. All good.

238
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,564
那你为什么这么小声
So why are you so whispery?

239
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:37,166
我只是 严格来说 我是不可以
I just... I'm not technically allowed

240
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:39,702
现在打电话的 但是 这
to be on my phone right now, but, um... it's...

241
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:41,170
这太酷了 所以听着
it's totally cool. So listen.

242
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:42,805
根据受害者身上残留的
I, uh, based on the chemical residue

243
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:44,374
化学物质 我认为
on the victim's body, I think

244
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:46,075
你们要找的凶器是一种深海用的
that your murder weapon was a deep-sea,

245
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:47,810
燃烧氧的焊接喷枪
oxy-fueled welding torch.

246
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:50,046
需要有美国焊工联盟的证明
Now, you need certification from the American Welders Union

247
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,881
才能持有 并操作它
to own and... and operate one.

248
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:53,281
我们会检查他们的数据库
We check their database,

249
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:54,416
或许能筛选一份
might be able to compile a list

250
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:56,251
嫌疑人名单 干得好 Sebastian
of suspects. Good work, Sebastian.

251
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:57,519
好的 谢谢 我得挂了
Okay. Thanks. I got to go.

252
00:10:57,521 --> 00:10:59,054
确定一切都还好吗 Sebastian
Sure it's going okay, Sebastian?

253
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:00,555
不 什么 哦 好 好
No. What? Oh, yeah, yeah.

254
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:02,457
不 很好 一切都非常棒
No. It's great. Uh, everything's awesome.

255
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:03,625
说实话 我在这里很愉快
To be honest, I'm having a great time,

256
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:05,093
不能再好了 所以
and it couldn't be better, so...

257
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:06,861
混蛋 Lund 我说了不许打电话
Damn it, Lund! I said no cell phones!

258
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:08,296
哦 好的 好吧
Oh. Okay, all right.

259
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:10,164
他看上去很友善
He seems friendly.

260
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,999
不 那是特别探员Perkins
No. That's Special Agent Perkins.

261
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:15,102
我在FLETC的第一天 就见他弄哭了一名前海军陆战队员
I saw him make a former Marine cry on my first day at FLETC.

262
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:16,870
幸运的是 我只需要上周末课程
Luckily, I only had to do the weekend course,

263
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,772
而且我勉强通过了那个课程
and I barely made it through that one.

264
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:20,707
祝Sebastian好运吧
So, Sebastian's toast.

265
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:23,744
他体能上的不足 他都会从精神上弥补
Well, what he lacks in strength, he makes up for in spirit.

266
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:25,712
我可以跟你赌任何东西 他会通过的
I'll bet you anything he makes it through.

267
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:27,047
打赌的事以后再说吧
Save the bets for later.

268
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:30,016
Chris Gregorio 去Apolis总部 去看看他们
Chris, Gregorio, get to Apolis HQ. See if they got

269
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:32,152
是否知道 那艘船在他们的油塔附近做什么
any idea what that boat was doing out by their rig.

270
00:11:32,154 --> 00:11:33,920
我在焊工联盟有个老朋友
I got an old friend at the Welders Union,

271
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:37,290
应该可以帮我们获取数据库权限
should be able to get us access to their database.

272
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:43,462
帮不了你们 没人报告说
Can't help you. Haven't heard one word

273
00:11:43,464 --> 00:11:45,230
5号钻井有快艇接近过
about a boat near rig 5.

274
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:48,133
它多次穿过了你们的安全范围
It crossed your safety perimeter multiple times.

275
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:49,401
你们难道没有保安在那儿
Don't you have security in place

276
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:50,702
监控周边船只吗
to monitor vessels from doing that?

277
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,438
你是想知道我怎么管理公司
You interested in how I run my company

278
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,905
还是想知道我有没有看到那艘快艇
or whether I saw this boat?

279
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:56,542
没事 妈妈 我来解释
It's all right, Mom. I'll explain.

280
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:59,010
当指标下降 石油市场触底时
When the indexes fell and the oil market bottomed out,

281
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,712
我们被迫在财政方面做了艰难的决定
we were forced to make some hard fiscal decisions.

282
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:03,548
我们不得不取消了安保 就这么简单
We had to cut security, plain and simple.

283
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,517
花10万美元拿到工商管理硕士学位 现在话都不会说了
$100,000 for an MBA and he's speaking gibberish.

284
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,519
你们有24个人在国际水域
You got 24 men out there in international waters

285
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:10,555
就没人照看他们一下么
and no one looking out for them?

286
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:13,757
我们不是英国石油公司 我们只是个家族企业
We're not BP. we're a family business.

287
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:13,757
{\a6}目前世界第四大上下游一体化经营的跨国石油公司

288
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,893
泵机价格下跌以后 我们能做的
And with prices falling at the pumps, we either had to start

289
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:17,961
要么减少轮班 要么减少安保人员
cutting shifts or cut security personnel.

290
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:18,995
该死
Damn it.

291
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:20,263
这周围遭到了破坏
These perimeter breaches,

292
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:22,132
这些标识对应我们油管泄漏的地方
they correspond with leaks to our pipeline.

293
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:24,267
-泄漏 -六个月前
- Leaks? - Six months back,

294
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,436
5号钻井突然开始出现泄漏情况
puncture-leaks start popping up around rig 5.

295
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:28,905
我们不得不关闭石油生产 直到把它们焊好
Had to shut down oil production till we welded them up.

296
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:31,841
Nielsen上尉是被深海焊枪杀死的
Lieutenant Nielsen was killed by a deep-sea welding torch.

297
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:33,610
也许那个焊枪原本有别的用途
Maybe it was intended for something else.

298
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,544
比如在管道上烧几个洞
Like making holes in the pipeline.

299
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,580
能想到有谁会做这种事吗
Any idea who would want to do something like this?

300
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:39,081
我们的任何竞争对手都会这样做
Just about every one of our competitors.

301
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,749
没错 不过我们的工程师们确定
Yes, except our engineers determined those leaks

302
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,684
管道上的那些洞都是正常磨损导致的
to be normal wear and tear to our pipeline.

303
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:44,786
别天真了 Elliot 我们一直在亏损
Don't be so naive, Elliot. We're all hurting here.

304
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:46,355
每次我们关闭一个油井
Every time we shut down a rig,

305
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,357
沿海地区的油价就会飙升
oil prices spike across the seaboard.

306
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,926
企业的蓄意破坏 我感觉就像回到了华盛顿
Corporate sabotage. I feel like I'm back in D.C.

307
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:53,294
这和华盛顿无关 石油生意就是很残酷的
This may not be Washington, but oil's a cutthroat business.

308
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:55,763
你们需要什么来查清整件事
What do you need to get to the bottom of this?

309
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:57,832
帮我们确认那艘快艇上凶手的身份
Help us I.D. the killer on that boat.

310
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:58,933
如果有人看到什么
Anybody saw something, it'd be

311
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:00,101
那人就一定在钻井平台上
one of those men out on that rig.

312
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:01,569
那我们就得去那个平台了
Then we'll need to get on that rig.

313
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,471
好的 我联系到一架直升机
Well, I got a helo

314
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:06,141
一小时后飞过去换班
taking a shift out in an hour.

315
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:07,675
如果你们想去 还有一个空位
One seat left if you want it.

316
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:09,343
-我去 -我去
- I'll take it. - I'll take it.

317
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:10,910
石头剪刀布
Rock-paper-scissors?

318
00:13:10,912 --> 00:13:13,247
得了 这是浪费时间
All right. Ah, it's a waste of time.

319
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:15,382
我们都不会坐上那个座位
We're not getting on that seat anyway.

320
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:16,983
那谁会
Well, who is?

321
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:05,629
第一次来 是不是
First time out, huh?

322
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:07,731
你知道我在哪能找到钻井经理吗
You know where I can find the rig manager?

323
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,334
跟上 我领你去
Keep up. I'll show you.

324
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:13,837
闻到了吗
Oh, yeah. Smell that?

325
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,939
汽油味 体臭
Petrol, B.O.

326
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,574
还有甜蜜的海风
and the sweet ocean breeze.

327
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:20,276
拥抱它吧 地球上再没有地方跟这儿一样了
Embrace it. No place like it on Earth.

328
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:21,777
你做钻工多久了
How long you been roughnecking?

329
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:22,845
两年
Two years.

330
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:24,814
不过 这是我最后一次过来了
This is my last hitch, though.

331
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:28,451
是时候开始下一段旅途了 一个新世界
Time for the next part of my journey, a new frontier.

332
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:30,920
给 看看这个
Here. Check this out.

333
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:34,089
"心之所向包租公司"
“Your Heart's Desire Charters”.

334
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,624
我曾在安第斯山脉跋涉
I've trekked the Andes,

335
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,992
给横渡大西洋的货船导航
navigated transatlantic cargo ships,

336
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:41,663
拿到了学位 现在 我的飞行员执照也有了
got my degree, and now... my pilot's license.

337
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,932
还有你见过的那架
Plus the sweetest little twin engine Cessna

338
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:45,467
双引擎塞斯纳飞机
you've ever laid eyes on.

339
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,935
-印象深刻 -嗯
- Very impressive. - Mm.

340
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:50,504
我能不能自作主张地给你提点建议
Can I give you a piece of unsolicited advice?

341
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,673
你在这里 要把注意力放在工事上
While you're here, set your eyes on the work,

342
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:54,842
而不是看风景 钻井是个危险的地方
not the view. Rig's a dangerous place.

343
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:57,144
而且这里太远了 等医疗直升机飞过来
And it's remote. By the time the medevac gets here,

344
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,613
一切就都太迟了
it's always too late.

345
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:00,348
我会记住的
I'll keep that in mind.

346
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,250
那是你要找的人
There's your man.

347
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:03,718
记住
And remember,

348
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,886
留意钻井
eyes on the rig.

349
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:17,930
你肯定是Pride探员
You must be Agent Pride.

350
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:20,199
我是Hauser 很高兴你能过来
I'm Hauser. Glad to have you aboard.

351
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,301
谢谢
Thank you.

352
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:22,369
法人代表让我为你
Corporate told me to give you

353
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,770
提供你所需要的一切
access to whatever you need,

354
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:26,171
你让我往东 我不会往西
so, you say jump, I'll say how high.

355
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:27,640
非常感谢
I appreciate it.

356
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:29,475
我需要跟你的工作人员谈谈
I need to speak to your crew.

357
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,843
看看有没有人记得有艘快艇来过这里
See if any of them remember a boat that's been out here.

358
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:34,480
就在最近 几天前的晚上
Most recently, a couple nights back?

359
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:36,382
噢 我们这里有不少船只过来呢
Oh, we get a lot of boats out here.

360
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:39,050
你能不能说得更具体些
You... You want to be more specific?

361
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:41,519
45英尺超级运动快艇
The 45 foot Super Sport.

362
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:43,388
有人非法使用了它
Someone was using it illegally.

363
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,122
哦 船真漂亮 我猜
Oh. She's a beauty. I'm guessin' there's more

364
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:46,891
能把NCIS引过来
to the story than just some joyridin'

365
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:48,259
肯定不是飚船之类的
to bring NCIS out here.

366
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,662
一名海军上尉在船上被杀了
Navy lieutenant was murdered on it.

367
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:54,231
好吧 那我们 我们先跟平台人员谈谈吧
Okay. Well, let's, uh... let's talk to the floor hands first.

368
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:04,874
当然 Pride在夏天去过他叔叔的钻井平台干活儿
Of course Pride spent summers working on his uncle's oil rig.

369
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,643
这家伙还有什么没做过的事
What hasn't the guy done?

370
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:09,613
经过认证的全能型人才 所以他是老大
Certifiable Renaissance man. That's why he's the boss.

371
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:11,581
不过我才是你们要找的人
But this is why I'm the man.

372
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,684
为你们找到了一个上尉谋杀案的嫌疑人
Found you a suspect in the lieutenant's murder.

373
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,118
Pride的联络有回音了
Pride's connection paid off.

374
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,186
我们进入了焊工联盟的数据库
We got us access to the Welders Union database.

375
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:18,654
我们一直在交叉对比
We've been combing through it, cross-referencing

376
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:20,690
Nielsen上尉的个人信息和数据库
with Lieutenant Nielsen's personal life.

377
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:23,492
Darren Meade 焊工联盟的正式会员
Darren Meade. Card-carrying member of the union,

378
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:24,993
Nielsen上尉的姐夫
Lieutenant Nielsen's brother-in-law.

379
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:27,029
他应该知道Nielsen在外出
Would have known Nielsen was on tour,

380
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:28,764
并且知道他的快艇没有人用
and known his boat was available.

381
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,098
根据联盟的记录
And according to union records,

382
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,367
他在Nielsen被杀的早晨
he refilled an oxygenized torch-tank

383
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:34,035
给焊枪燃料箱补充了一个富氧燃料罐
the morning of Nielsen's murder.

384
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:35,236
Darren Meade现在在哪儿
Where's Darren Meade now?

385
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:36,604
问到点上了
Well, that's the kicker.

386
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:37,939
Darren在钻井上工作
Darren works the rigs for a living.

387
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,041
他刚开始十天的轮班
He just cycled into a ten-day shift.

388
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:43,010
-猜猜他在哪儿 -Apolis的5号钻井平台
- Guess where. - Apolis oil rig 5.

389
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:45,513
Pride跟凶手一起在钻井平台上 而他并不知道
Pride's on the rig with the killer, and doesn't know it?

390
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:47,615
离海岸200英里远 他的手机也没信号
200 miles off the coast. He ain't got cell reception either.

391
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:50,718
我给油井的座机打电话
I'll call the rig's sat line.

392
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,220
我们得警告他
We got to warn him.

393
00:16:54,923 --> 00:16:57,157
你确定之前没看到一个运动快艇
You sure you didn't see a Super Sport?

394
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,726
没有 警官
No, sir.

395
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:00,361
没看见不能说看见了
Can't say I seen it.

396
00:17:00,363 --> 00:17:01,862
您刚才说它什么时间来过
When did you say it was here?

397
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:03,997
几天前的一个晚上 十一点左右
Around 11:00 p.m. Couple nights back.

398
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,566
经理说你当时正在上夜班
Manager said you were working the swing shift.

399
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,801
在这个有利位置 你的视野应该会很清楚
From this vantage point, you would've had a clear view.

400
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:09,902
没错
Yeah.

401
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,604
我看得很清楚
I would've.

402
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,506
可我当时什么都没看到
But I didn't see nothing.

403
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,678
脖子上的淤青很严重啊 怎么弄的
Nasty bruise you got on your neck. What happened?

404
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,081
不小心撞到甲板下面的管道了
Ran into a water pipe below deck.

405
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,582
管道碰巧是手指形状的么
Pipe happened to be hand shaped?

406
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,085
在Apolis 什么形状的管道都有
Got all kinds of pipes on Apolis.

407
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,788
根据个人记录
According to personnel records,

408
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,289
你是这钻井上唯一
you're the only welder on this rig

409
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,258
有权使用焊枪的焊工
authorized to use that torch.

410
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:36,728
我想是的
I guess that's true.

411
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,063
跟你有关吗
What's it to you?

412
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:40,831
你老板说前两周
Well, your boss says you've been working repairs

413
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,232
你一直在负责维修
the last two weeks.

414
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:44,435
我猜如果我检查两晚前的
Assuming that if I check the shift logs

415
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:46,771
交班记录 我能找到你的名字
two nights back, I'd find you.

416
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:49,172
你为什么要这么做
Why would you do that?

417
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:51,008
因为你一直在对我说谎
'Cause you've been lying to me.

418
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:22,447
这只是演习
This is just a drill.

419
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:25,650
所有工作人员去食堂大厅报到
All crew members report to the mess hall.

420
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:29,453
重复 所有工作人员去食堂大厅进行安全检查
I repeat, all crew to the mess hall for a safety check.

421
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:30,754
你要把所有人都支走
You stashing away the crew

422
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:32,122
直到我们想出解决办法为止吗
till we figure out how to play this?

423
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,990
现在只有一种解决办法
There's only one way to play this.

424
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:35,459
在那家伙找到救生艇
Take care of this guy before he gets

425
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:37,661
或传话出去以前 干掉他
to one of those lifeboats, or gets word off this rig.

426
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,996
我已经拿到他的枪 干掉他会简单许多
It should be easier now that I got his gun.

427
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:42,132
如果当时你冷静一点 而不是突然慌张
Yeah. It'd be easier if you'd played it cool

428
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:43,400
一切会更简单
instead of going all pyro.

429
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:44,735
我们现在都找不到他了
We can't even find him.

430
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:46,269
没得选啊 他盯上我们了
No choice. He was onto us.

431
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:49,205
所以呢 我们现在要杀警察了吗
So what? We're killin' a cop now?

432
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:52,205
{\a6}无服务

433
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,478
我很不情愿这么做
I get no pleasure from it,

434
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,749
但必要时候我们必须为了自己这样做 对吧
but we do what we have to to take care of our own. Right?

435
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:02,051
-我们杀的人越来越多了 -嘿 我们这么做
- Bodies are starting to stack up. - Hey, we got into this

436
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,184
就是为了给家里
to make some money,

437
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:04,720
多弄些钱
provide for our families.

438
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:07,055
我可不想因此进监狱 你想吗
I'm not about to go to prison for it. Are you?

439
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,926
给他一枪 把尸体扔下去
Put a bullet in him, toss him over.

440
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:20,033
沉降流会让他的尸体
The downwellings out here will take his body

441
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,702
直接沉到海底
right to the ocean floor.

442
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,103
没人会再见到他
Nobody will ever see it again.

443
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:24,838
只是个钻井事故罢了
Just be another rig accident.

444
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,941
这人在安全演习的时候慌了 直接掉进海里
Guy panicked during a safety drill, fell overboard.

445
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:38,351
你凭什么觉得他们会买账
What makes you think they'll buy that?

446
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:40,587
因为我有两个目击证人
'Cause I got two witnesses

447
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:42,322
来证实我说的话
to back up my story.

448
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:01,206
没进展么
I take it no luck?

449
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,575
Apolis总部和钻井彻底失去联系了
Apolis HQ lost all communications to the rig.

450
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,577
他们正在努力弄清楚发生了什么
They're scrambling to figure out what's going on.

451
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,546
你从海岸警卫队那里有什么好消息吗
You do any better with the Coast Guard?

452
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:09,014
正在调动他们距离最近的小型武装快艇 但是
Redirecting their nearest cutter-- it'll be three,

453
00:20:09,016 --> 00:20:11,482
也得三四个小时才能抵达钻井
four hours before the boat reaches that rig.

454
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:13,451
所以我们根本没办法警告Pride
So we got no way of warning Pride

455
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:15,753
他正和一个凶手呆在一起
he's out there with a killer.

456
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:18,389
是多个凶手 调出了谋杀案那晚
Killers, plural. Dumped Darren's phone records

457
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:20,257
Darren的通话记录
from the night of the murder.

458
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:22,393
他和Apolis的两名雇员
He was in touch with two Apolis employees--

459
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:24,462
Jackson Hauser和Lyle Peterson联系过
Jackson Hauser and Lyle Peterson.

460
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:26,964
我检查了他们的短信 能看出其中两个人
Yeah, I checked their texts-- it appears that two of them

461
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:29,299
在上尉被烧死的当晚在快艇上
was on the lieutenant's boat the night he got torched.

462
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:31,835
所以Pride不止和一个凶手在一起 而是三个
So Pride's not with one killer, he's with three?

463
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:33,337
其中一个还是经过训练的
And a trained one at that.

464
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,905
Hauser以前是个步兵 在阿富汗打过仗
Hauser's ex-infantry, fought in Afghanistan.

465
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:37,674
他们负责给管道打洞
These guys put holes in that pipeline.

466
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:39,543
他们很有可能想在Pride揭发他们之前
There's a good chance they'll want to take Pride out

467
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:41,712
-干掉他 -我们没时间
- before he blows the whistle. - And we don't have time to wait

468
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,279
等海岸警卫队的快艇到那儿了
for the Coast Guard cutter to get there.

469
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:44,447
去把他们召回
Let's call them back,

470
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:45,948
-看他们能不能用直升机送我们过去 -好
- see if they'll chopper us out. - All right.

471
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,650
Patton和Sonja继续尝试
Patton, Sonja, keep trying

472
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:49,652
和钻井重新取得联系
to reestablish connection with the rig.

473
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:51,420
必要时候给Sebastian打电话
Call Sebastian if you have to.

474
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:53,288
-不惜一切代价 -现在就办
- Do whatever it takes. - On it.

475
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,990
Gregorio 你跟我来
Gregorio, you're with me.

476
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,859
挺有Pride的样子啊 Lasalle
Not a bad Pride impression, Lasalle.

477
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,728
不过我还是更喜欢真的那个
I still prefer the real thing, though.

478
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,163
相信我 我也是 我们去找他
Trust me, so do I. Let's go get him.

479
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:04,332
哦 又是美好的一天
Oh, just another day in paradise.

480
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:07,301
嘿 如果你在找食堂的话 兄弟
Hey, if you're looking for the mess hall, my man,

481
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:09,070
-这里可不是 -我是个联邦探员
- this ain't it. - I'm a federal agent.

482
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:11,038
在这个钻井上 有人想杀我
There are men on this rig who are trying to kill me.

483
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,841
我需要对外通信
I need to get a line out.

484
00:21:12,843 --> 00:21:14,642
整个系统都是离线的
The whole system's offline.

485
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:16,778
传感器 无线电 卫星通信 所有都是
Sensors, radio, satcom, all of it.

486
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,812
还有什么办法能从这里发出消息吗
Is there any other way to get a message off this thing?

487
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:20,447
在钻井地下室有个无线电发射器
There's a distress beacon in the rig cellar--

488
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:22,716
你可以用摩尔斯电码发求救信号
you can send an SOS using Morse code.

489
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,457
那哥们刚才不是在开枪打我们吧
That dude did not just shoot at us!

490
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:32,593
-你还好吗 -我还好
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.

491
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:36,095
我们得离开这里 快走
All right, we got to get out of here. Come on.

492
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:38,197
-趁他们还没闯进来... -我当时说
- Before they bust in... - This is not what I meant

493
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:40,299
希望能在旅途的最后听到嘭的响声
when I said I wanted to go out with a bang

494
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:41,601
可不是指这个
on my last tour.

495
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:50,576
嘿
Hey.

496
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:52,211
拿着 把水喝了
Here you go, drink that.

497
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:54,178
慢点儿喝
Slow.

498
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:01,497
你能告诉我为什么这几个修理工想杀你吗
You want to tell me why those grease monkeys want you dead?

499
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:04,423
他们杀了一位海军 而我是不会让他们逍遥法外的
They killed a Navy sailor, and I'm not gonna let them get away with it.

500
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:08,593
如果你要抓这些坏蛋 我帮你
If you're gonna take out those fools, I'm with you.

501
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,462
慢着 慢着
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

502
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:12,433
你拿它干嘛
What are you gonna do with that?

503
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,665
在我长大的地方
Where I grew up,

504
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,666
如果有人打了你 你要打回去
if someone takes a swing at you, you swing back.

505
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,702
好吧 这是个值得尊敬的风俗 不过
Okay, all right, that's an honorable code, but...

506
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,705
面对装有11发子弹的SIG Sauer手枪
a wrench won't do any good against a SIG Sauer

507
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,874
一个扳手可不占什么优势
with 11 rounds left in the magazine.

508
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,309
那你有什么好办法
Well, what do you propose, then?

509
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,076
你带我去求无线电发射器那里
You take me to those signal beacons.

510
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:29,479
我给我的团队发信息 叫后援
I'll get word to my team, get backup.

511
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,247
我们要拿下他们
We'll take these guys down.

512
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,049
嘿 我不需要你来代表我
Hey, I'm not looking to get deputized here.

513
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,484
我也不怎么喜欢"我们"这个词 好吗
And I'm not much for “we,” okay?

514
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,085
所以你做你的 我做我的
So you do you and I'll do me.

515
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:38,287
也许我也能找到一把信号枪
Maybe find another one of those flare guns.

516
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:39,856
Bonnie Bonnie 对吧
Bonnie. Bonnie, right?

517
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,691
-对 -听着 我需要你
- Yeah. - Okay, listen, I need you

518
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,525
按照我说的去做
to do what I tell you to do.

519
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:45,794
在食堂里有20个无辜的人
There are 20 innocent people up in that commissary.

520
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:48,530
如果我们进行枪战 有人打中了油箱
We get into a shoot out, someone hits a fuel tank,

521
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:50,566
那他们的死就有我们的责任
their deaths are gonna be on us.

522
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:52,801
我们需要合作
We got to do our part,

523
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:55,203
而不是直接冲进枪林弹雨
and running into a hail of bullets isn't it.

524
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:58,306
所以你带我去无线电发射器那里
So are you gonna show me where those beacons are,

525
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:00,075
还是我自己去找
or do I have to find them myself?

526
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:03,778
你最好有一个厉害的团队
You better have one hell of a cavalry.

527
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,746
三个都是国内最好的探员
Three of the best agents in the country.

528
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:07,949
三个
Three?

529
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:09,951
三个人么
As in three people?

530
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,819
暂时 过几周会有第四个
For now. Couple weeks I'll have a fourth--

531
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:13,454
但他得通过训练
he's got to get through training.

532
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:14,822
-天啊 -快 我们走
- Oh, God. - Come on, let's go.

533
00:23:14,824 --> 00:23:16,090
好吧
All right.

534
00:23:26,234 --> 00:23:28,201
Sebastian
Sebastian!

535
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:30,003
哦 抱歉 大伙
Oh. Sorry, guys.

536
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:43,081
哦 哦 别打了 别打了
Ow, ow, cut it out, cut it out, ow, ow.

537
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,484
我说过不能带电话 Lund
I said no more cell phones, Lund.

538
00:23:45,486 --> 00:23:48,053
你害死了自己 还有你的队友
You got yourself killed, and your team, too!

539
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:50,956
-我可以解释的 -不 你不行 因为你已经死了
- I can explain. - No, you can't, because you are dead.

540
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,991
-死人是不会说话的 -是 但重点是
- Dead men do not talk. - Yeah, but the point is

541
00:23:52,993 --> 00:23:54,959
我队友一直给我打电话 我 我不能
my team keeps calling me, and I-I can't...

542
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:57,695
总统跟你打电话又怎样
I don't care if the president of the United States is calling you.

543
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:00,031
我再发现你打电话 你就完了
I catch you on that phone again, you're done.

544
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:01,265
懂了不
Got it?!

545
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,434
把手机拿开
Put it away!

546
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,037
进去再来一次
Get in there and start over.

547
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,705
走
Go!

548
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,848
哪边
Which way?

549
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,550
-哦 完了 -咋了
- Aw, man. - What?

550
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:21,317
一直在冲击
The hits keep comin'.

551
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,420
太多钻机液被泵进来了
Too much drill fluid's being pumped in.

552
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,621
-钻井过度负载了 -有多糟糕
- It's overstressing the well. - How bad are we talking?

553
00:24:25,623 --> 00:24:27,745
像"天启四骑士"那么糟糕
Like “Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse” bad.

554
00:24:25,623 --> 00:24:27,745
{\a6}出自圣经，指人类的四大灾祸：战争、瘟疫、饥荒、死亡

555
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:28,876
咱们得赶紧离开这里
We got to get out of here right now.

556
00:24:28,877 --> 00:24:30,619
等等 Bonnie 等等
Whoa, whoa, Bonnie, no, no, we...

557
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:31,962
我们还得去信号塔
we still have to get to the signal beacons,

558
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:34,396
-警告我的团队 警告所有人 -好 行
- warn my team, warn everybody. - Okay, fine,

559
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:35,631
但是我们得快点了
but we got to hurry up.

560
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:36,799
这些仪表告诉我
These gauges are telling me

561
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:37,767
平台就要爆炸了
this rig's gonna blow.

562
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,401
这边
This way.

563
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:46,575
这个平台可以说是一个巨型的无线信号接收器
This rig is basically one giant Wi-Fi receiver.

564
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:49,077
没道理我连接不上啊
There's no good reason why I can't connect.

565
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,411
不想承认这一点
Hate to admit it,

566
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:52,113
但是我需要Sebastian的帮助
but I can use an assist from Sebastian.

567
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,615
我已经给他打过十几个电话了
Well, I've called him, like, ten times.

568
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,684
甚至还跟训练员留了言
I even left word with the training officer.

569
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:57,085
还是没回应
Still nothing.

570
00:24:58,822 --> 00:25:00,788
这是 这是啥
What the... what is that?

571
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,156
来自这个平台
It's coming from the rig.

572
00:25:03,158 --> 00:25:06,894
有人用摩斯码从平台发送信息
Someone's broadcasting Morse code off that rig.

573
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:09,129
我想我知道是谁
I think we know who.

574
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:11,932
-肯定是Pride -给我支笔
- Pride for the win. - Hand me a pen.

575
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,302
你从哪学的 在ATF么
Where'd you learn that, ATF?

576
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:17,503
-不是 是女童子军 -真的假的
- No. Girl Scouts. - Really?

577
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:18,771
高阶童子军
Senior level.

578
00:25:18,773 --> 00:25:20,539
那就露一手吧 女童军
Well, let's hear it, troop leader.

579
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,445
平台就要 爆炸了
Rig is going to... blow.

580
00:25:26,447 --> 00:25:28,414
离
Stay...

581
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,116
远点
away.

582
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,586
天啊 真希望是我的摩斯码退步了
God, I hope my Morse code is rusty.

583
00:25:33,588 --> 00:25:35,687
有办法核实 NASA的公开资源
One way to check. NASA open source,

584
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:37,990
EO-1热能天线卫星
EO-1 thermal satellite.

585
00:25:37,992 --> 00:25:40,626
好了 我刚刚对准了平台
Okay, I just aimed it at the rig.

586
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:43,561
哦 不 你的摩斯码没有退步
Oh, no, your Morse code ain't rusty.

587
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:46,164
那个红色的暴风云是碳氢化合物气体
That red storm cloud is all hydrocarbon gas.

588
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,465
意思是
Meaning...?

589
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:48,867
意思是 我们再不快一点的话
Meaning if we don't act fast,

590
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:51,435
我们看到的就是"深海地平线"了
we're looking <i>Deepwater Horizon</i> all over again.

591
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:51,435
{\a6}位于美国路易斯安那州海岸约80公里的近海钻井油田。2010年4月20日发生爆炸并沉没，导致大规模的墨西哥湾原油污染。

592
00:25:51,437 --> 00:25:53,738
我们还有多长时间
How long do we have?

593
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:57,341
没多长
Not long.

594
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:12,444
Pride正在那个随时都要爆炸的平台上
Pride's out there on that ticking time bomb of a rig

595
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,364
和三个凶手一起 你却把车开走了
with three killers, and you turn the car around?

596
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,347
把钥匙给我 我要要直升机
Give me the keys-- I'm getting on that chopper.

597
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:17,244
你哪儿也别想去
You're not going anywhere.

598
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:18,781
行 我开我自己的车
Fine, I'll take my own damn car.

599
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:19,986
你并不是老大 Lasalle
You're not the boss, Lasalle.

600
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,625
对 我不是 Pride才是
No, I'm not. Pride is.

601
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:23,591
不管他在这 还是在海岸线200英里外的地方
And whether he's right here or 200 miles off the coast,

602
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,325
我们都要听他的
we do what he says.

603
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:25,825
我不要
I don't...

604
00:26:28,694 --> 00:26:29,827
现在 我们
Now, we all

605
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:32,230
都希望Pride回到他的办公桌上
want Pride back at his desk...

606
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:34,098
但是我们不能争吵
but we cannot do that by arguing.

607
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,399
Gregorio
Gregorio,

608
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:37,068
Lasalle是对的 平台周围爆炸气体的量太大了
Lasalle is right. With the amount

609
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,436
你们赶到那里
of HC gas around this rig, by the time you get there,

610
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:40,322
也是白费
it'll be too late.

611
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:41,473
那我也不能就坐在这
Well, I'm not just gonna

612
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,907
看着他炸飞
sit around and watch it blow.

613
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:44,640
Pride还指望着咱们呢
Pride is counting on us

614
00:26:44,642 --> 00:26:46,442
找个办法救他
to find a way to save him

615
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:49,079
以及平台上的所有人
<i>and</i> the people on that rig.

616
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:51,014
那就开始工作吧
So let's get to work.

617
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:53,416
好吧 咱们怎么办
All right. Where do we start?

618
00:26:53,418 --> 00:26:55,418
找到了
I got it.

619
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,121
跟着我 我展示给你们
Follow me. I'll show you.

620
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,258
我的系统一直在搜索
Kept my system scanning

621
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,927
从平台上发出的无线电信号
for radio signals to and from the rig.

622
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:08,130
有人在远程给平台上的液体泵发信号
Someone is remotely signaling the rig's fluid pumps,

623
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:10,632
往钻井里灌泥水 扰乱洞内压力
filling the well with mud, messing up the hole pressure.

624
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:12,434
这就解释了即将爆炸的原因
Explains why it's about to blow.

625
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:13,523
咱们的三个凶手在平台上
Well, our three killers are on the rig--

626
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:15,038
你是说他们还有同伙
you saying they have an accomplice?

627
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,839
某些会牺牲他们生命来掩盖踪迹的人
Someone willing to sacrifice their lives to cover their tracks.

628
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:18,873
我们能阻断信号么
Can we kill the signal?

629
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,608
得找出信号的来源
Got to find out where it's coming from.

630
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,725
同伙方面有头绪么
Any idea on the accomplice?

631
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:22,912
可能是生态恐怖分子
Well, it could be ecoterrorists.

632
00:27:22,913 --> 00:27:24,979
他们之前瞄准过墨西哥湾的钻井平台
They've targeted the Gulf rigs before.

633
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:26,981
不可能 这三个嫌犯是彻头彻尾的油井修建工
No, the three suspects are lifelong roughnecks--

634
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:28,783
可不是树木热爱者
not exactly tree huggers.

635
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:30,651
也许是Apolis的竞争者之一
Hey, maybe one of Apolis's competitors.

636
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:33,554
有可能 但是我感觉这个凶手要更接近一些
Maybe, but I got a feeling this hits closer to home.

637
00:27:33,556 --> 00:27:36,256
遥控那个平台只有两个方法
There's only two ways that rig's remotely operated--

638
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:38,525
要么是黑客 要么是
either by a hacker, or someone who has access

639
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:40,209
有权进入Apolis控制中心的人
to the control center at Apolis.

640
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:40,828
等一下
Wait.

641
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:43,330
为啥Apolis要炸掉他们自己的钻井平台
Why would Apolis want to blow up their own rig?

642
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:45,432
和他们竞争者相同的原因
Same reason their competitors would.

643
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:47,467
Patton 你能调出Apolis最近六个月的
Patton, can you pull Apolis's revenue streams

644
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:49,836
财政流水账单么
over the last six months on the go?

645
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:52,038
我们要去Apolis的总部
We're going to Apolis HQ.

646
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,672
这你还用问
Do you even have to ask?

647
00:27:55,143 --> 00:27:56,675
行动吧 Gregorio
Your move, Gregorio.

648
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,177
好的
All right.

649
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:04,050
关掉15号
Close down 15.

650
00:28:04,052 --> 00:28:06,018
还有油泥区分仪
And the mud-gas separator.

651
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:09,020
不 不管用
No, it's not working.

652
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,588
肯定有人远程控制了泵
Someone must be remotely overriding the pumps.

653
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,856
我们无法阻止
We can't stop them.

654
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,858
还得继续尝试
Got to keep trying.

655
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,294
我们再呆在这就要死了 赶紧
If we stick around here, we're dead. Come on!

656
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,029
我们得让所有人离开平台
We got to get everyone off this rig.

657
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,965
马上就来
Right behind you.

658
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:22,167
好了 救生船就在这里
Okay. Lifeboats are through here.

659
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:23,736
你准备好船 我把员工带来
You prep the boats-- I'll bring the crew to you.

660
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,303
好的
Okay.

661
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,311
快来
Come on.

662
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:38,349
Johnny 你得把吊车挪走
Johnny, you got to move this crane.

663
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:39,883
Benny有拖船要过来
Benny's got a tug coming in.

664
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,352
你们不能就这么随心所欲地踏进我的地盘
Hey, you can't just come onto my property anytime you want.

665
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,153
我们有搜查证就可以了
Got a warrant that says we can.

666
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,022
你所有的设施都归我们管
Your whole facility is under our control.

667
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,690
我们查了你的流水账单
We checked your revenue streams.

668
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,193
你关掉5号钻井平台 你的竞争对手有利可得
When you shut down rig 5, your competitors benefited,

669
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,428
但猜猜看谁的收益最大
but guess whose earnings went up the most?

670
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,131
你付钱给你的人 让他们在你的输油管凿洞
You paid your own men to put holes in your own pipeline,

671
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,433
阻断石油 拉高油价
choke out the oil, raise the prices of gas.

672
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,547
还导致一名无辜的海员在这一过程中丧命
And got an innocent sailor killed in the process.

673
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:01,171
我一个字都不用听
I don't have to listen to a word of this.

674
00:29:01,195 --> 00:29:02,205
我要给我的律师打电话
I'm calling my lawyers.

675
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:04,806
哦 不必了 有人在你的办公室控制着
Oh, no, you're not. Someone in your office is controlling

676
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:06,808
钻取平台的压力系统
the pressure systems of the rig.

677
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,443
我们知道是谁了
And we're finding out who.

678
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:10,278
你们根本没有证据
You don't have a shred of evidence.

679
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,215
平台上的三个油井修建工就可以让你完蛋
We got three roughnecks on that rig that are ready to bury you.

680
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:15,083
所以你想炸掉它
Which is why you're trying to blow it up.

681
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:16,385
如果你不想一辈子待在监狱
If you want to avoid a lifetime in prison,

682
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,952
你就得告诉我们如何阻止这事情发生
you need to tell us how to stop this from happening.

683
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:21,288
我做的一切都是为了发展我的事业
All I've ever done is try to grow my business,

684
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,589
照顾我的员工
look out for my people.

685
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:24,691
为了救这些人我可以放弃一切
I'd give up everything to save those men out there.

686
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:27,261
我对这起事故没有责任
I'm not responsible for this catastrophe.

687
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:29,863
好吧 如果不是你 那会是谁 一名技工吗
Okay. If not you, then who, a technician?

688
00:29:29,865 --> 00:29:32,333
他们必须得知道密码才能超控系统
They'd have to know the passcodes to override the system.

689
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,634
只有一个人...
Only one person...

690
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:39,406
我的天啊
God help me.

691
00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:42,642
我的儿子
My son.

692
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:45,811
他是我们的首席技术官 是他设计的系统
He's our CTO, designed the system himself.

693
00:29:45,813 --> 00:29:47,047
只有他了
He's the only one.

694
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:48,648
他人现在在哪儿
Where is he now?

695
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,250
不太舒服 说是得了流感 回家了
Didn't feel well. Said he had the flu, went home.

696
00:29:51,252 --> 00:29:53,718
更可能是去机场了 我发协查通告去
More like the airport. I'll put a BOLO out.

697
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,987
我把一切都交给了他
I gave him everything.

698
00:29:56,857 --> 00:29:59,324
你们得帮我阻止这事
You have to help me stop this.

699
00:29:59,326 --> 00:30:01,726
好消息和坏消息 Patton恢复了和平台的通讯
Good news and bad-- Patton reestablished comms with the rig

700
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,828
中断了正在注入油井的泥浆
and shut off the mud being pumped into the well.

701
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,230
坏消息呢
And the bad?

702
00:30:05,232 --> 00:30:07,332
这事情已经没办法回头了
This thing is past the point of no return,

703
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:08,766
不论是谁干扰它
and whoever was messing with it

704
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:10,468
都会使防喷器失灵
disabled the blowout preventer, too.

705
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,303
撤离倒计时已经开始了
Evacuation countdown's already begun.

706
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:14,038
我们离爆炸还有15分钟
We got 15 minutes before it goes up.

707
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,073
有可能保住它吗
Any way to save it?

708
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:16,240
有 奇迹
Yeah. A miracle.

709
00:30:16,242 --> 00:30:19,544
或者是一个智商160的机械天才
Or a mechanical genius with an IQ of 160.

710
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:25,015
让Patton发我钻井平台的设计图 让我临时接入
Have Patton send me the rig blueprints and get me patched in out there.

711
00:30:25,017 --> 00:30:26,386
我马上去拿电脑
I'm gonna be on a computer in two shakes.

712
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,017
该死的 Lund
Damn it, Lund!

713
00:30:27,018 --> 00:30:28,485
你就是控制不住自己 是吗
You just can't help yourself, can you?

714
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:29,752
-情况紧急 -我管不了了
- It's an emergency! - I don't care!

715
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:31,421
你要是想拿到徽章 你就得听我的
You want a badge, you belong to me.

716
00:30:31,423 --> 00:30:33,090
没有紧急情况 没有解释
No emergencies, no exceptions.

717
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,625
而且你也不能接触电脑 你听明白了吗
And no way you're going to those computers. You got it?

718
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:38,261
不 我没明白 因为如果要在我的团队和我的徽章中做选择
No, I don't get it. Because if it's a choice between my team

719
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:40,497
那我百分百选我的团队
or my badge, then I'm gonna choose my team every time.

720
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:42,498
现在 他们需要我
And right now, they need me.

721
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,101
你们跑不了了
<i>You got no more moves,</i>

722
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:46,535
Pride探员
Agent Pride!

723
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:48,036
出来吧
Come on out!

724
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:49,371
我们来谈谈
We'll conversate.

725
00:30:49,373 --> 00:30:51,407
可以 只要你丢掉武器
It's a deal. Soon as you drop

726
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:53,275
向我们投降就可以了
your weapons and surrender.

727
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:55,144
该投降的不是我
I'm not the one who has to surrender.

728
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:57,413
我把你逼到了角落
And I've got you cornered.

729
00:30:57,415 --> 00:31:00,047
你走投无路了
No way out.

730
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:04,051
他说得对 我们完蛋了
He's right. We're screwed.

731
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:10,057
你为什么这样看着我
Why are you looking at me like that?

732
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:12,193
你没有幽闭恐惧症 对吗
You're not claustrophobic, are you?

733
00:31:12,195 --> 00:31:14,962
什么
What?

734
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:19,966
这真的不是个好主意
This is a really bad idea.

735
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:22,402
我甚至都不知道通风系统通往哪里
I don't even know where the ventilation system leads to.

736
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:24,070
会带你离开这里 这是肯定的
Out of here. That's for sure.

737
00:31:24,072 --> 00:31:28,375
听着 你沿着这个通风口走 直到碰到第二个
Listen, you follow this vent until you find another one.

738
00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:31,077
到食堂 把船员带到救生艇上
Get to the mess hall and get the crew to the lifeboats.

739
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:37,816
我们重新连上了
We're back online.

740
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:40,419
喂
Hello?

741
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:43,122
找你的
It's for you.

742
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:45,958
Pride
Pride.

743
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,127
Pride 我是Sebastian 没时间寒暄了
Pride, it's Sebastian. No time for small talk,

744
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:50,828
但我想我有办法阻止钻井平台爆炸
but I think I got a way to stop the blowout on the rig.

745
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,997
-Sebastian 你是个大救星 -现在 你需要帮助
- Sebastian, you're a lifesaver. - Now, you're gonna need help,

746
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:54,666
找一些个头特别大 很强壮的工人
so grab some-some big, burly drill dudes

747
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:56,234
然后到地下室去
and get to the cellar deck.

748
00:31:56,236 --> 00:31:57,636
我知道你的动向 你到那里
I'm tracking your movements. I'll call you

749
00:31:57,638 --> 00:31:58,637
再打给你
when you get there.

750
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:01,273
你有11分钟
You got 11 minutes.

751
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:04,409
记得在训练中的那个探员吗 那第四个探员
Remember that agent-in-training, the fourth one?

752
00:32:04,411 --> 00:32:05,977
他可能有办法阻止这场爆炸
He may have a way to stop this thing from blowing.

753
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:08,212
-好极了 我们该怎么办 -你有11分钟
- Great. What do we do? - You got 11 minutes

754
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:10,648
找到出口 把船员带离钻井平台
to get up that vent and get the crew off the rig.

755
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,915
你不上船吗
You're not coming on the boats?

756
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:13,150
听着 这玩意儿要爆炸了
Look, this thing blows up,

757
00:32:13,152 --> 00:32:14,518
石油会流入海湾
oil coats the gulf again,

758
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,053
这对海岸将是致命的打击
it'll be a death blow to the coast.

759
00:32:16,055 --> 00:32:17,521
-好 -我不会让这事情发生
- Okay. - I'm not letting that happen.

760
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:18,589
那是什么
What is that?

761
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:21,024
喷灯火焰
Torch.

762
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,459
没错
Yeah.

763
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:24,061
他们正在进来 快走
They're cutting their way in. Go now.

764
00:32:24,063 --> 00:32:25,295
你一个人办不到
You can't do this alone.

765
00:32:25,297 --> 00:32:26,629
我不是一个人
I'm not alone.

766
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:28,598
听着 我们都有自己的任务 Bonnie
Look, we all got to do our part, Bonnie.

767
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,866
你得保证船员安全 现在快走
You got to get this crew to safety. Now go.

768
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,702
你是个奇怪的家伙 Pride
You're a strange dude, Pride.

769
00:32:35,473 --> 00:32:37,407
Hauser
Hauser,

770
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:40,610
听好了 关掉喷灯
listen up! Turn off the blowtorch!

771
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:43,478
我出来了
I'm comin' out.

772
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,980
现在你听清楚我说的每一个字
And you're gonna listen to every word I have to say.

773
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:48,250
我们为什么要这么做
And why exactly will we do that?

774
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:52,287
因为这个钻井平台在10分钟之后要爆炸了
'Cause this rig's gonna blow in the next ten minutes,

775
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:55,324
而我是唯一一个知道如何阻止爆炸的人
and I'm the only one who knows how to stop it.

776
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:06,567
我们听着呢
Well, you got our attention.

777
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:08,436
最好快点说
Better talk quick.

778
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:26,876
胡说八道 他在虚张声势 好让Bonnie逃走
This is a bunch of crap. He's bluffing so Bonnie can get away.

779
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:28,847
你们有比她更严重的问题需要去担心
You got bigger problems to worry about than her.

780
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:30,938
钻井平台马上要变成大火球了
This rig's goin' up in a fireball

781
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,673
如果我们不做点什么
if we don't do something about it.

782
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:34,707
如果这地方要爆炸 我们肯定能听到警报声啊
If this place were gonna blow, we'd be hearing sirens.

783
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:36,276
刷新一下你的电脑
Refresh your computer.

784
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:39,612
警报系统应该重新上线了
Warning system should come back online.

785
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:42,215
让你破坏输油管的人
Whoever you were working with

786
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:44,217
给你下了套
to sabotage the pipeline set you up.

787
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:47,454
他们现在要毁尸灭迹 包括你们三个
Looking to clean up their mess. You three included.

788
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,257
他没说错
He's right.

789
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:53,392
井底的压力值都爆表了
Bottom hole pressure's off the charts,

790
00:33:53,394 --> 00:33:55,494
防喷器也失灵了 你能改成手控吗
and the preventer's offline. Can you override it?

791
00:33:55,496 --> 00:33:56,462
这儿不行
Not from here.

792
00:33:56,464 --> 00:33:58,431
我们 好像 只有9分钟了
We got, like, nine minutes!

793
00:33:58,433 --> 00:33:59,532
我们得上救生船
We got to get to the lifeboats.

794
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:00,599
不行 Bonnie和船员把船开走了
No, Bonnie and the crew took 'em.

795
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:02,768
你们别无选择 只能帮我
You got no other option but to help me.

796
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,637
只是管道上的几个洞 不是吗
Just a couple holes in the pipeline, huh?

797
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:07,372
为我的家人去做
Do it for my family.

798
00:34:07,374 --> 00:34:09,274
这不是你说的吗 Hauser
Isn't that what you said, Hauser?

799
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:10,408
不不 这是他的错
Uh-uh, this is his fault.

800
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,776
继续在我脸上晃你的枪
Keep waving that weapon in my face,

801
00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:13,111
我先崩了你
I'll feed it to you.

802
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:18,015
你说你知道怎么停止爆炸
You said you know how to stop it?

803
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:19,517
带我去底层甲板 我会告诉你的
Get me to the cellar deck. I'll show you.

804
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:28,459
-Sebastian 你说吧 -好的
- Talk to me, Sebastian. - Okay,

805
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:29,793
你们所要做的是
all you guys need to do

806
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:32,529
激活爆炸防护器
is activate the blowout preventer...

807
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:34,798
用来封住管道
...to seal the pipe

808
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,533
并防止在水下爆炸
and prevent an underwater blowout.

809
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:38,034
这很简单 是吗
That's easy, right?

810
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:43,339
现在 有两个幸运儿要爬去
Now, two lucky contestants are gonna climb down

811
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:44,640
下面的爆炸防护器
to the blowout preventer.

812
00:34:44,642 --> 00:34:46,809
Pride 下去的路挺长的
Pride, it's a long way down.

813
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:48,077
你最好快一点
You better hurry.

814
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,278
明白了
Got you.

815
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,747
走吧 Hauser
Let's go, Hauser.

816
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:56,085
在上面的人
You guys up on the top,

817
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:57,820
你们得等到他们上来之后
you have to wait until they surface

818
00:34:57,822 --> 00:35:00,188
再关上舱口 锁住阀门
before you close the hatch, turn the valves,

819
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,290
然后封井 如果你不这么做 你们会害死他们的
and seal the well. If you don't, you're gonna kill them.

820
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:04,626
好的 Pride 我看见你在下面了
All right, Pride, I see you down there.

821
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:06,094
找两块控制面板
Look for two control panels.

822
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:09,598
一块蓝色的和一块黄色的
One blue and one yellow.

823
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,300
现在 这部分非常关键 你必须
Now, this part is super important. You have to turn

824
00:35:12,302 --> 00:35:14,836
同时转动两把激活钥匙
the activation keys at the same time.

825
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:17,804
他们花太久时间了 我们不能等了
It's taking too long. We can't wait!

826
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:19,573
钟走到五的时候 我就转
That clock hits five, I'm doin' it.

827
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,842
一 二 三
One, two, three.

828
00:35:21,844 --> 00:35:23,210
在钟走到零的时候
Then book it up the ladder

829
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:24,678
你们得爬上梯子
before the clock strikes zero.

830
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,383
我要这么干了 关舱门
I'm doin' it. Close the hatch.

831
00:35:29,385 --> 00:35:30,917
好的 我同意你
Yeah. I'm with you!

832
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:31,918
他们快上来了
They're almost up!

833
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,453
别 千万别
Don't! Just-just wait!

834
00:35:33,455 --> 00:35:34,855
他们来了 他们就在那里了
They're coming. They're right there.

835
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,824
伙计们 快点出来 你们有十秒钟
Get out of there, guys. You got ten seconds.

836
00:35:38,826 --> 00:35:40,326
八秒
Eight seconds.

837
00:35:40,328 --> 00:35:43,029
六秒
Six seconds.

838
00:35:43,031 --> 00:35:46,266
好了 关舱门 关舱门
All right, close the hatch! Close the hatch!

839
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:49,101
我们关上了 按按钮
We're closed! Hit it!

840
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:54,939
我们没事了
We're clear.

841
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:05,384
所以 现在怎么样
So... what now?

842
00:36:08,954 --> 00:36:10,821
我不得不逮捕你们
I have to arrest you

843
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:12,923
因为Nielsen上尉的命案
for the murder of Lieutenant Nielsen.

844
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:17,895
你打算怎么做
And how do you plan to do that?

845
00:36:17,897 --> 00:36:19,096
举起手来 混账
Hands up, jackass.

846
00:36:20,933 --> 00:36:23,033
就是这样
That's how.

847
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:25,635
应该拿着那把枪的
Probably should've held on to that gun.

848
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:28,338
你回来了
You're back, huh?

849
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,407
每个人都要完成他们的任务
Everybody's got to do their part.

850
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:32,475
我的还没做完
Mine wasn't over.

851
00:36:32,477 --> 00:36:34,344
好吧 我欠你的
Well, I owe you one.

852
00:36:34,346 --> 00:36:38,348
让我和这些白痴们待五分钟 我们就扯平了
Give me five minutes with these morons, we'll call it even.

853
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:59,400
Lund
Lund.

854
00:36:59,402 --> 00:37:01,135
我有话跟你说
I'm gonna tell you something.

855
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,271
不 是我有话跟你说
No, you know what, I'm gonna tell you something.

856
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:04,872
没错 我没有遵守命令
Yeah, I disobeyed a direct order.

857
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,907
但你知道吗 我不在乎
But guess what, I don't give a damn.

858
00:37:06,909 --> 00:37:09,410
如果成为一名探员意味着
If becoming an agent means abandoning my team

859
00:37:09,412 --> 00:37:10,845
在我的队伍需要我的时候抛弃他们
when they need me the most, well,

860
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:12,580
那你可以拿走我的徽章 并且你可以
then you can take that badge and you can sh...

861
00:37:12,582 --> 00:37:14,181
Lund
Lund!

862
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,283
你做得很好
You did good.

863
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:17,917
再说一次
Come again?

864
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,953
还记得我让你爬绳子的时候 跟你说的话吗
Remember what I told you when I chased you up the rope?

865
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:22,522
我需要找到我向上的动力
That I needed to find a way to motivate my butt up it?

866
00:37:22,524 --> 00:37:25,592
你愿意为了你的队伍放弃徽章
You were willing to sacrifice your badge for your team.

867
00:37:25,594 --> 00:37:27,461
你找到了
You found it.

868
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:29,329
训练颇有成效 不是吗
Training works good, doesn't it?

869
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,865
现在回到训练房去 你给我
Now get back to the gym. You owe me

870
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:33,299
跑五十圈 因为违反规则
50 laps for breaking the rules.

871
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:34,333
长官 是的长官
Sir, yes, sir.

872
00:37:36,371 --> 00:37:39,037
快点
Move it!

873
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,143
仅仅是管道上的几个洞
<i>It was just</i> <i>a couple holes in the pipeline.</i>

874
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:46,245
最终演变成海军军官的谋杀案
Which turned into the murder of a Navy officer

875
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:48,216
以及对24名钻机工人的谋杀未遂
and the attempted murder of 24 of your rig workers.

876
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,566
本应该没有人受到伤害的
No one was supposed to get hurt.

877
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,317
好吧 大家不都这么说
Well, that's what they all say.

878
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,051
我本意是让公司顺利运转
I was trying to keep the company afloat.

879
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:58,055
在这过程中差点毁了整个海湾
And nearly destroyed the entire Gulf in the process.

880
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:00,725
想象一下这会对你母亲产生什么样的后果
Imagine what that would've done to your mama.

881
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:04,496
我一辈子都在让她失望
I've disappointed her every day of my life.

882
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:07,164
我唯一想要的就是她对我的尊重
And all I ever wanted was her respect.

883
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:10,701
本以为如果我挽救了她宝贵的公司 我会获得尊重
Thought if I saved her precious company, I-I'd finally get it.

884
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,536
我向你保证一件事情
Well, I'll promise you one thing,

885
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:15,506
Angola的监狱顾问会给你足够多的时间
you'll have plenty of time to work through those mommy issues

886
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:18,141
解决你的恋母情结
with the prison counselor at Angola.

887
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,879
我会给国土安全部打电话
I'll call DHS,

888
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:25,548
让他们来接他去审讯
have them pick him up for processing.

889
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,283
Gregorio
Gregorio.

890
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:28,718
你干得非常棒
You did good in there.

891
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,186
谢谢
Thanks.

892
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:31,821
你也不赖
You weren't so bad yourself.

893
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:35,658
Roy 给我们一些时间好吗
Roy, will... you give us a minute?

894
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,494
嘿 Lasalle
Hey, look, Lasalle,

895
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:41,029
我知道我们一直合不太来 但今天是
I know we've been butting heads but today was like...

896
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:42,497
巨大的成功
A huge success.

897
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,133
都过去了
It was.

898
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:46,802
毕竟 我们最终抓到了坏人
I mean, after all, we took down the bad guys,

899
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:48,169
一天下来
and at the end of the day,

900
00:38:48,171 --> 00:38:49,871
这才是最重要的事情 对吗
that's all that really matters, right?

901
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:52,708
是的 但我们还是因意见不合而大吵特吵
Right, but still, we were at each other's throats.

902
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,410
这是成长的烦恼 自古都是如此
It's growing pains, ancient history.

903
00:38:55,412 --> 00:38:57,511
历史总是不断的重复
History tends to repeat itself.

904
00:38:57,513 --> 00:38:59,313
就我看来
As far as I'm concerned,

905
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:01,281
因为我们都在乎 所以才吵架
we were arguing 'cause we both cared,

906
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:03,584
这是件好事情
and that's a good thing.

907
00:39:03,586 --> 00:39:05,753
好吧 我同意
All right, I'm down with that.

908
00:39:05,755 --> 00:39:07,788
但 还是发生了
Still, it happened.

909
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,459
所以 我们应该告诉Pride这血淋淋的细节 还是怎样
So, you think we can spare Pride the gory details, or what?

910
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:14,461
这只是办公室的日常
It's just another day at the office down here.

911
00:39:14,463 --> 00:39:15,762
底线是
Bottom line,

912
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:18,631
他不需要知道今天发生的所有事情
is he doesn't need to know anything about today.

913
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:24,404
-哈喽 有人在家吗 -嘿
- Hello? Anybody home? - Hey!

914
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:25,872
-嘿 -他来了
- Hey, man! - There he is!

915
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:27,741
真高兴看你完好无缺的回来了
Hey, good to see you in one piece.

916
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:28,975
你是完好无缺的吧
You are in one piece?

917
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:31,042
当然 就一些小伤口
Oh, yeah, it's just a flesh wound.

918
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:33,945
如果不是你们的话 会糟糕很多
Could've been a lot worse if it hadn't been for you all.

919
00:39:33,947 --> 00:39:35,283
我不在 你们干的不错
You did a good job without me.

920
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:37,083
哦 是的
Oh, yeah.

921
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,785
完全没有问题 就像上了油
This was seamless. It was like a well-oiled

922
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:41,953
但又很吵的机器
but extremely loud machine.

923
00:39:41,955 --> 00:39:43,555
我需要知道这话什么意思吗
Do I want to know what that means?

924
00:39:43,557 --> 00:39:45,624
意思是 我们很高兴看到你回来
It means we're glad to have you back,

925
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:47,658
主持大局
calling the shots.

926
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,194
好的 那这样
Okay. In that case,

927
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:52,797
我们先把文书工作放一边 去喝一杯吧
I say we forget the paperwork, go get a drink.

928
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:53,308
哦
Oh!

929
00:39:53,332 --> 00:39:54,767
棒 正合我意
Yes. Now you're talkin' my language.

930
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:55,554
第一轮我买单
First round's on me.

931
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:57,068
恐怕我不能让你这么做
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

932
00:39:57,069 --> 00:39:58,483
这是我作为绅士的责任
It's my gentlemanly responsibility.

933
00:39:58,507 --> 00:40:00,238
你这么说话真是
Literally makes me nauseous

934
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,194
令我恶心
when you talk like that.

935
00:40:01,218 --> 00:40:02,908
他们一直这样吗
They been like this the whole time?

936
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:04,341
-别提了 -别提了
- You have no idea. - You have no idea.
