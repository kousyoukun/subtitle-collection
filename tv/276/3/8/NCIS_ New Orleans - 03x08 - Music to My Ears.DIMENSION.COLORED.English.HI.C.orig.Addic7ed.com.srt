No. It's your private life,

I found a strange soil sample

637
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:01,422
in the victim's house.

638
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:03,690
Analysis came back
with evidence of PCBs.

639
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:05,158
Stuff they used for insulation

640
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,593
for electrical equipment
back in the day.

641
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:08,027
Really toxic, right?

642
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:09,329
Yeah. It's been
banned since the '80s.

643
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:11,030
Anyway, I checked
Heather's property,

644
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:13,233
no sign of the
same levels of toxicity,

645
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:14,701
so I figured I'd come
to all the places

646
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:17,137

and gather some samples.

647
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:18,438
Yeah, but you could
have called us.

648
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,973
We would have brought you
a sample.

649
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:21,006
Nah, it's good to
get out in the field.

650
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,941
You know? Away from the lab.

651
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:24,343
Breathe in the fresh air,

652
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,044
even if it's filled
with deadly fumes.

653
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:27,846
Whoa. How dangerous
is this stuff?

654
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,348
Well, on a scale
from one to lethal?

655
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,783
Even limited exposure can lead

656
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:32,285
to serious
respiratory illnesses.

657
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:34,086
It's, it's the real deal.

Got a problem, King.

661
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:44,596
It looks like Heather found
sediment containing PCBs

662
00:27:44,598 --> 00:27:45,963
behind Dustin's school.

663
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,532
It could be the reason
she was killed--

664
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:48,966
to keep her quiet.

665
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,669
PCBs can make someone sick?

666
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,236
Yeah. It affects
the respiratory system,

667
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,672
especially in kids.

Oh, no. We got to get you

<font color="#D900D9">(coughing)</font>
I got you, I got you.

674
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:19,214
There's a doctor here.

00:28:19,216 --> 00:28:21,715
All right? Secure.

676
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:27,021
Dustin's okay now.

677
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:30,391
But his blood test came
back positive for PCBs.

678
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:31,893
That's the same toxin
Sebastian found

679
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:33,560
at the construction site
by Dustin's school.

680
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:35,729
Yeah.
Hospital's contacting

681
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:37,731
the other students
for testing.

682
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,966
Probably why so
many of them got sick.

683
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,467
Doc says that

684
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,137
Dustin's asthma
exacerbated his reaction.

685
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,738
Luckily, it's treatable.

686
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,441
Music academy's been on
that location for 20 years.

687

Nothing like this
ever happened before.

688
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,246
Well, maybe the construction
workers uncovered the PCBs

689
00:28:53,248 --> 00:28:54,580
when excavating the site.

690
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:56,048
Or they brought
it in with them.

691
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,750
Either way, Heather
discovered the problem,

692
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,719
killed before she
could expose it.

694
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,789
It's hard enough
keeping them safe

695
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,824
from the normal worries of life,

696
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:09,328
and then you've got to wonder if
their school's on a toxic dump?

697
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:13,631
That's a lot.

698
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:16,901
Look...

699
00:29:16,903 --> 00:29:20,471
You take care of them
the best you can.

700
00:29:20,473 --> 00:29:23,741
Teach them how to
take care of themselves.

701
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:27,312
It takes work,
sleepless nights,

702
00:29:27,314 --> 00:29:29,712
a lot of faith.

703
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:32,916
How did you balance
it out, King?

704
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:37,654
Working, marriage,
raising Laurel?

705
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:41,258
You do your best.

00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:01,344
Need to figure out the origin

712
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:03,044
of the toxic sediment.

713
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:05,113
It could lead us
to Heather's killer.

714
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:08,183
Okay.

from the construction site had
only trace amounts of PCBs.

717
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:15,556
And there's not enough
there to get one kid sick,

718

let alone half
the student body.

719
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:18,293
But the construction crews

720
00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:20,060
were working overtime
at the school

721
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:22,629
the last day or so;
I saw the bulldozer tracks.

722
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:24,598
Maybe they moved
the toxic soil.

723
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,266
Well, if they were dealing
with PCBs,

724
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:27,934
then they would have had to pull
a ton of safety permits.

725
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:29,436
And they definitely wouldn't
have allowed kids

726
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:31,338
to be anywhere nearby
until it was all cleared.

727
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,639
Then they moved it illegally.

728
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:34,541
Okay. So Heather
figured it out,

729
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:37,310
was gonna expose them,
and got killed for it.

this construction company
moved the toxic waste

and Heather was trying
to expose them.

748

I tried, though.
I mean, her-her phone

749

and her computer were wiped,

750

restored to
factory settings.

751
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,114
I assume that she went to
a lab to test the soil,

752
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:18,849
but there's no proof of it.

You know, it's like the
killer covered all his tracks.

What about the
construction company?

755
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:26,290
Well, that's, uh,

00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:22,309
to the Heather Cobb murder?
Yeah. We think she got hip

784
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,910
to the PCB's in the soil

785
00:32:23,912 --> 00:32:25,812
making the kids sick,
started looking into

786
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:27,581
the construction and dredging
company responsible.

787
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,881
Javier Garcia owns it.

788
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:30,817
Avery Builders.
We know all about it.

789
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:32,185
Listen, you need to back off.

790
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:34,621
Is this some kind
of state secret?

791
00:32:35,524 --> 00:32:37,356
It's a cartel front.

792
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:40,058
Probably laundering drug money,
though we can't prove it yet.

793
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,129
So Javier Garcia's an imbed?
He arrived in New Orleans

794
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:44,930
months ago, been buying
companies and properties

795
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:46,898
all over the city--
he's probably gonna be

796
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,800
our new focus
in the investigation.

Sounds very official.
What are you looking for?

808
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:20,738
Evidence of mishandling
toxic soil

809
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,490
at the Crescent City
Music Academy.

810
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:23,775
As well as evidence

811
00:33:23,776 --> 00:33:25,877
about Heather Cobb's murder.
Let's go.

812
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,879
Well, if you think I had
anything to do with that tragedy

813
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,148
at the school,
you don't know me very well.

814
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,383
I don't know you at all,
Mr. Garcia.

815
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:34,718
But we found PCB's

816
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,286
at your construction site.

817
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:37,888
Heather Cobb did, too,
and you know

818
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,456
what happened to her.
My son goes

819
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,790
to that school.

820
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:42,159
He's under a doctor's care

821
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:43,660
for a respiratory infection,

822
00:33:43,662 --> 00:33:45,895
as much a victim
as the other children.

823
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:46,728
This is your
construction company.

824
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:49,565
I own many companies--
don't run the day-to-day.

825
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,734
I just found out
about the PCB's.

826
00:33:51,736 --> 00:33:55,037
That's why I'm here--
to handle the situation.

827
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,077
King. Take a look at this.

828
00:34:05,015 --> 00:34:08,183
I found this
inside that cabinet.

829
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:09,584
Heather's trumpet case.

830
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,887
Inside, a container of dirt,

831
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,788
along with...
lab report.

832
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,723
Taken from Heather's house.

833
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:21,028
This is the man I saw you with
yesterday at the school.

834
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,930
Theo Beattie, my foreman.

835
00:34:22,932 --> 00:34:24,858
I-I've been looking into
this since yesterday.

836
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:28,293
Seems Theo used substandard
materials to cut costs.

837
00:34:28,295 --> 00:34:29,497
Contaminated soil.

838
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:30,630
You know where he is?

839
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:32,130
He's supposed to be here
waiting for me.

840
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:33,665
I was going to deal with him.

841
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:36,100
I found this e-mail
that Theo tried to delete.

842
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:37,602
It's from Heather Cobb.

843
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:40,405
She confronted him
about kids getting sick.

844
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:42,607
Was going to the EPA.

845
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:44,409
The guy's in the wind, King.

846
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:46,544
Probably in Mexico by now.

847
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:49,947
He'll have to go further than
that if he wants to escape me.

848
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,852
Uh, we'll take care
of Theo Beattie.

stole scrubs and an ID,

867

pulled a gun on the guard.

Take care of each other.

941
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:51,075
You still here?

942
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:53,110
I figured Isler
would be wondering

943
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:55,312
where you are about now.
Probably.

944
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:57,781
I just wanted
to see this case through.

945
00:38:57,783 --> 00:38:59,316
Hm.

946
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:01,852
Don't be a stranger,
Gregorio.

947
00:39:03,622 --> 00:39:05,989
<font color="#D900D9">(takes deep breath)</font>

948
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:21,971
Explain something to me.

949
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:25,273
I put you front and center on
the Ciudad Natal investigation.

950
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:26,774
Career-making case.

951
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:29,344
Yet you drop everything
to help NCIS.

952
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:30,745
They were shorthanded.
Not to mention

953
00:39:30,747 --> 00:39:32,414
almost exposing us
to Javier Garcia.

954
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,782
He has no idea we suspect him
of cartel ties.

955
00:39:34,784 --> 00:39:37,685
I thought Theo Beattie might
provide evidence against him.

956
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:39,153
The construction worker?

957
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:41,522
Who dumped the toxic waste
at the school? Not likely.

958
00:39:41,524 --> 00:39:43,424
He wasn't involved
in cartel business.

959
00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:45,192
<font color="#D900D9">(sighs)</font>

960
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:47,361
I got to ask, Gregorio--

961
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:49,596
are you happy at FBI?

962
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:55,102
Honestly, sir...

963
00:39:55,104 --> 00:39:57,203
I don't know.

964
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,208
<font color="#D900D9">(exhales)</font>

965
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:05,178
Well, you better
figure it out quick,

966
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,113
because we head for D.C.
in a couple of hours,

967
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,215
and I need to know
whose team you're on.

968
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,858
<b><font color="#FF8000">PRIDE:</font></b>
<i>I'll be honest. I'm surprised.</i>

969
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,660
I know you haven't
been satisfied lately,

970
00:40:21,662 --> 00:40:23,795
but this is a big life change.

971
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,631
You sure you're ready for it?

972
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,368
Well, I-I don't know
if I'm ready for it,

973
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:33,304
but I know I... I need
to give it a shot.

974
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,040
I want to be part of the team.
You are part of the team.

975
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:38,576
I know, I know, and lab work
is... rewarding.

976
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:40,445
Or... it used to be.

977
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:41,845
I just...

978
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:44,648
I don't know, I-I
feel like I can...

979
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,750
offer more.
I want to do

980
00:40:46,752 --> 00:40:49,119
what you guys do.
It's a hard job, Sebastian.

981
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:50,954
Yeah, look,
this is not a whim, okay?

982
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:52,322
I already submitted
my application

983
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,690
to be a special
agent-- I-I...

984
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:55,792
I am all in.
I was, uh,

985
00:40:55,794 --> 00:40:58,195
actually kind of...
hoping that...

986
00:40:58,197 --> 00:41:01,030
maybe I could get
a recommendation?

987
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:02,732
Training is tough, Sebastian.

988
00:41:02,734 --> 00:41:04,633
Tougher than anything
you've ever been through before,

989
00:41:04,635 --> 00:41:06,235
but if you pass...

990
00:41:06,237 --> 00:41:08,637
I'll give you more
than a recommendation,

991
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,307
I'll give you a job.

992
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:13,275
Oh, my God, really?

993
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:16,645
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckling)</font>: Yeah,
