怎么了
What's wrong?

4
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:20,902
呆在里面别出声
Stay inside and not a sound.

-这是玩游戏么 -Dustin

你不能进我家
You can't be in my house!

9
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:36,516
闭嘴 你把它藏哪儿了
Shut up! Where did you hide it?!

10
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:39,086
滚出我家
Get out of my house!

11
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:41,688
我要报警了
I'm gonna call the cops!

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,124
你谁也别想叫
You are not... calling anyone!

我也不喜欢给你换尿布 老弟
I hate diaper changes as much as you do, bud.

25
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:44,047
请问你是
You are...?

26
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:47,650

抱歉
Um... excuse me.

30

附近有个案子

我跟Pride说我过去的时候顺便带上你
I told Pride I'd swing around and pick you up.

32
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:00,195
那你也应该先通知我一声
Well, you should've called.

33
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:01,530
我给你打过电话了 也发过短信
I did call and text,

34
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:02,898

A son?

什么都想问
So many...

Guess I better get going.

54
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,738
你要离开很长时间么 Christopher
You think you'll be gone long, Christopher?

55

Bye.

00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:12,397
你还好吧
You okay?

61
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,065
好得很
Peachy.

62
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,666
来的路上你可一句话都没说啊
'Cause you didn't say a word on the way over here.

63
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:16,767
没什么想说的
Don't have any words.

64
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:19,204
我应该早点告诉你的
I should've told you sooner.

65
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:20,838
刚才在车上你都说了好几回了
Which you said a dozen times in the car.

66
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,540
你不用说的 我不生气
You don't have to. I'm not mad.

67
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,242
真的么 可你看起来很生气
Really? You seem mad.

68
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:26,410
没有 这是你的私人生活 与工作无关
No. It's your private life, nothing to do with work

69
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:27,511
与我也无关
and it's none of my business.

70
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:28,745
好吧
Okay...

71
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:29,813
就像你告诉了组里其他所有人
Just like it's none of my business

72
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:30,780
你的亲亲宝贝
you told everyone else

73
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:31,815
唯独没告诉我一样
on the team

74
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:32,849
这都与我无关
about your love child except me.

75
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:33,850
无所谓
Doesn't mean a thing.

76
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:34,818
我们挺好的
We're good.

77
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,587
等一下
So, wait...

78
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:39,723
你生气了
you are mad.

79
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:41,058
NOPD昨晚
NOPD got

80
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,459
接到了一通有关家庭暴力的报警电话
a domestic disturbance call last night.

81
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,328
邻居听到了尖叫
Neighbor heard screaming.

82
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,796
巡警发现了死去的军士Heather Cobb
Patrol found Petty Officer Heather Cobb dead.

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,566
她是海军准将的一员
She's a member of the Commodores,

84
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:52,135
海军爵士乐队
the Navy Jazz Band.

85
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:53,569
是普通盗窃案恶化成凶杀案了么
Think this simple burglary went aggravated?

86
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:55,838
这可不是简单的盗窃
This is more than just a burglary.

87
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,740
这地方都翻遍了
This place is turned upside down.

88
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:59,107
嫌犯在找某个特别的东西
Suspect searching for something specific?

89
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:00,842
不论凶手想找什么
Whatever the killer was looking for,

90
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:02,710
被害人一定不想让他找到
our victim didn't want it found.

91
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:03,845
她有防御性创伤
She has defensive wounds

92
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:06,181
在她的头上 手上
on her forearm, hands...

93
00:04:06,183 --> 00:04:07,482
死前的擦伤
Pre-mortem bruising

94
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:08,517
和撞伤
and contusions

95
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,319
在躯干 脖子和脸上
on torso, throat, face.

96
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:13,688
还是搏斗了一番的
Put up a fight.

97
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,923
很可惜 搏斗不奏效
Sadly, not a good enough one.

98
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:16,157
要下结论还太早
It's too soon to tell,

99
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:17,591
但我猜钝物重击
but I'm guessing blunt force trauma

100
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:19,026
就是死亡原因了
as cause of death.

101
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:23,064
老大 看看这个
King, check this out.

102
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,498
你发现了什么
What'd you find?

103
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,633
主卧在墙的另一边
Master bedroom's on the other end of the hall.

104
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:27,935
那又如何
Yeah, so?

105
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:29,403
谁在这张床上睡觉
Who was sleeping in this bed?

106
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:31,539
也许还有其他人在这间房子里
Maybe someone else was staying in the house?

107
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,339
散开找找
Spread out and look around.

108
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:35,141
嗨 Gregorio
Hey, Gregorio.

109
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:36,809
你来了真好
Hey. Nice of you to stop by.

110
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,111
FBI还是我的主业
Well, FBI's still my day job.

111
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:39,279
和你们查案算是业余爱好
You guys are more of a hobby.

112
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,213
我错过了什么
What'd I miss?

113
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:41,281
楼上一个受害者死亡
One victim upstairs dead.

114
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,782
可能有第二个受害者
Possible second victim

115
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,451
逃出了房子 我们要搜查
made it out of the house. We're gonna search

116
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:45,518
整个地区
the area.

117
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
我和你一起
You're with me.

118
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:48,654
自从我们从河沟里
You know, ever since we plucked

119
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,755
把Ciudad Natal的会计
that Ciudad Natal accountant

120
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:50,922
捞出来之后
out of the bayou,

121
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:51,890
特区一直想甩锅
D.C.'s been turning

122
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,024
给Isler
the screws on Isler

123
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,025
想起诉
to try to get indictments

124
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,194
Natal贩毒集团
on the cartel.

125
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:56,128
Isler也一直想甩锅
And Isler's been turning

126
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,362
给你
the screws on you.

127
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,730
这就是游戏规律
That's the way the game works.

128
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,898
不是全世界通用
Not everywhere.

129
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,567
Isler想在感恩节之前
Yeah, well, Isler wants to find

130
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,068
找出藏在新奥尔良的
the cartel embeds in New Orleans

131
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,603
贩毒集团卧底
before Thanksgiving.

132
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,238
那就意味着你要在这里过节了
That means you'll be in town for the holiday?

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,772
给我一个好借口来躲避家人
Gives me an excuse to avoid family.

134
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,674
好吧
Yeah, well...

135
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:12,009
在我的节日餐桌上
always got a place

136
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,078
总有你的一个位子 如果
at my Thanksgiving table if you...

137
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,081
如果你愿意的话
...if you want it.

138
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,083
别指望我去做饭啊
Don't expect me to cook.

139
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,518
你可以带个派
You can always bring pie.

140
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,154
-Sebastian -怎么了
-Sebastian. -Yeah?

141
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,387
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

142
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,422
我在收集证据啊
I'm gathering evidence.

143
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:26,889
罪案现场在房子里面
Crime scene's inside the house.

144
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:27,924
是这样么
Or is it?

145
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:29,392
来看下这个
Check this out.

146
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:31,128
我找到了这个门
So, I found this door.

147
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,529
想着凶手也许是从这里进入的
Thought maybe it was the killer's entry point

148
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,531
不过 门却没锁
except... it was unlocked

149
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,533
是从里面损坏的
and broken from the inside.

150
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:38,535
当时我又注意到了
Now, that's when I also noticed what...

151
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:40,237
-看上去像是脚印 -正是
- Looks like footprints. - Exactly.

152
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,870
这些痕迹或者通向
Now, these tracks lead either

153
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:43,172
这边的锁起来的门
to a locked gate over here...

154
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:45,407
-对 -或者是这边的门
-Yeah? ... -or to this door over here.

155

- Hey, you want to check it out? - No, no, no, no, no.

158
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:52,348
谢谢了 去把Percy和Lasalle叫来
Thank you. Get Percy and Lasalle.

159
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,550

我们不会伤害你的
We're not gonna hurt you. Please.

166
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:24,344

167
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:26,946
我保证 你现在安全了
I promise. You're safe now.

168
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:42,523
他说了什么
<i>He say anything?</i>

169
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:44,314
只说了他叫Dustin
Other than his name is Dustin,

170
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:46,615
-他妈妈是海军 -我去
-and his mom's in the Navy - I went to

171
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:48,750
Heather Cobb的家里给他拿了些干净的衣服
Heather Cobb's house to get him some clean clothes.

172
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:50,252
据邻居所言 这是她的侄子
According to neighbors, that's her nephew,

173
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:52,121
他一直跟她呆在一起
and he's been staying with her.

174
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:53,822
有道理
Well, it makes sense.

175
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:56,025
孩子母亲去日本的横须贺海军基地服役了
Mom's deployed at the Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan.

176
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:57,726
她正在赶回来的路上

177
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:59,094
父亲去世了

178
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:00,829
联系儿童保护服务中心了么
Contact Child Protective Services?

179
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:04,132
联系了 他们授权我们在他母亲回来之前暂时监护他
Yup. Got 'em to grant us custody until his mom returns.

180
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:06,600
我希望都盯着他 他可能是Heather Cobb谋杀案中
I want eyes on him. He might be our only witness

181
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:08,102
唯一的目击者
to Heather Cobb's murder.

182
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,107
给你
Here you go.

183
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:21,714
你能把它们 拿下来吗
Could you take... them...?

184
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:23,417
甘薯派
Sweet potato pancakes.

185
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,685
吃完后 也许我们可以
After you eat, maybe we can, uh...

186
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:29,189
谈谈之前发生了什么 好吗
talk about what happened, okay?

187
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:32,792
不过 不着急
But take... take your time.

188
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,862
如果他不吃的话 我来吃
If he doesn't eat them, I will.

189
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,597
总会多做一份
Yeah. Always make extra.

190
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,534
不得不说 我将来肯定会想念你做的菜 还有咖啡
Got to say, I'm gonna miss your cooking... and your coffee.

191
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,302
FBI的咖啡很难喝
FBI coffee is swill.

192
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:45,637
听上去像是告别
That sounds like a good-bye.

193
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,275
贩毒集团的案子要是结案了或者告吹了了
Cartel case is gonna close or blow up soon.

194
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:50,976
不管怎样 我都要离开了
Either way, I'm out of here.

195
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,646
你还好吗 孩子
You okay, kid?

196
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:58,550
Dustin
Dustin?

197
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,920
这是治哮喘的吗
Is this for asthma?

198
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,091
Dustin 我们会照顾你
Dustin, we're gonna take care of you

199
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:09,127
直到你妈妈回来 好吗
till your mom comes home, okay?

200
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,527
好
Okay.

201
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,762
嘿 King 我们发现了点东西
Hey, King? I think we got something.

202
00:08:12,764 --> 00:08:15,299
走访了
<i>Canvassed</i>

203
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:16,700
Heather Cobb的邻居

a white Jeep driving down her street the last couple weeks.

207
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:24,608
-有人看到车牌了吗 -问题就在这
- Well, someone get a license plate? - That's the thing.

208
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,542
那辆吉普没有车牌
Jeep has no plates.

209
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:26,710
不过我们还是发布了协查通告

210
00:08:26,712 --> 00:08:27,843

Heather Cobb被殴打致死

-为什么 -我们
- Why? - Well, we're

214
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,952
还不确定 因为Heather是个循规蹈矩的人

伯克利音乐学院硕士

221

有人想让她死
Well, someone wanted her dead.

222
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:50,599
我们得深挖下她的生活
Let's dig into her life.

223
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:53,168
你们两个去海军乐队 我去音乐学校
You two talk to the Navy Band, I'll hit the music academy.

Melody 我现在不能和你说话

228
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:03,810
怎么会有人丢了遥控器

229
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:05,979
管的真严啊 乡下鼠

Isler刚打来电话 听上去
Isler just called, and by the sound of it,

235
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,725

236
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:22,128

237
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,464
你一离开 我又要看一大堆简历了
You make me go through that stack of résumés again?

238
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:26,665
我还以为你会待得更久一点
Thought you'd be around a little bit longer.

239
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:28,118
嘿 如果我能决定
Hey, if it was up to me...

240
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:29,569
要是你能呢
Well, what if it was?

241
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,602
我的团队还有一个空缺
I got a space on my team.

242
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:37,736
如果你想要 就是你的了

243
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:40,373
加入NCIS吗
Join NCIS?

244
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,642
真是个不错的工作
That's a really nice offer.

245
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:47,413
但是我有工作
But I got a job, you know?

246
00:09:48,783 --> 00:09:50,682
使命在召唤
Duty calls.

247
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:53,351
好吧 那你为什么不至少考虑一下
Well, why don't you think about it at least, huh?

248
00:09:53,353 --> 00:09:56,654
我受宠若惊 真的 尽管这很有趣
I'm flattered, really, and as fun as it's been,

249
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:59,958
但都只是暂时的
this was always gonna be temporary, you know?

250
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:18,275
就剩你和我了 孩子
You and me, kid.

251
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,129
距袭击有好几周了
<i>Well, it's been weeks</i> <i>since the attack.</i>

252
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:42,332
不知道为什么NCIS现在才来
I'm not sure why NCIS is here now.

253
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:44,466
你说的袭击是什么
What attack are <i>you</i> talking about?

254
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:45,733
Gordon军士
Petty Officer Gordon.

255
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:47,402
前二号小号手
Former second trumpet.

256
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:49,371
用椅子打断了我的手
Broke my arm with a chair.

257
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:51,673
我们来这儿是为了Heather Cobb
We're here about Heather Cobb.

258
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:53,741
她昨晚被杀了
She was murdered last night.

259
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:56,611
不敢相信
I can't believe it...

260
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:58,080
我们想了解下你是否知道
We're wondering if you know of anyone

261
00:10:58,082 --> 00:10:59,640
有谁可能会伤害她
who might've wanted to do her harm.

262
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:00,449
知道
Yes.

263
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,915
和伤害我的是同一人
The same man who did this to me.

264
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:03,717
-Gordon军士 -他本来是
- Petty Officer Gordon. - He was in line

265
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,686
首席小号手的候选人 但Heather试演后
to be first trumpet. But when Heather auditioned,

266
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:08,155
她成功击败了他 毫无异议
she blew him away. It was no contest.

267
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:08,957
所以你给了她工作
So you gave her the job.

268
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,126
Gordon军士肯定不同意
Guessing Petty Officer Gordon didn't agree with that.

269
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:13,461
他对Heather一直不友好
He never gave Cobb a moment's peace.

270
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,162
在排练的时候骚扰她
Harassed her during rehearsals

271
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:17,430
排练结束后也骚扰她 Cobb向我抱怨了
and after hours. Cobb complained to me,

272
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:19,032
我决定调走他
I decided to have him transferred.

273
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,001
他就是在那个时候袭击你的么
And that's when he attacked you?

274
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:22,768
海军生涯就此结束
Ending his Navy career.

275
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,604
这就给了他另一个理由
Giving him even more of a reason

276
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:26,402
去和Heather Cobb摊牌
to have it out for Heather Cobb.

277
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:29,443
Gordon军士不开白色吉普 是吗
Petty Officer Gordon doesn't drive a white Jeep, does he?

278
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:31,844
事实上 他开
As a matter of fact, he does.

279
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:34,679
这说不通
<i>This doesn't make any sense.</i>

280
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:37,149
这几个小时我一直在研究犯罪现场的照片
I've been studying these crime scene photos for hours.

281
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:38,750
你现在不应该要处理证据么
Shouldn't you be processing evidence?

282
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:40,119
我已经处理完了 所有在现场的DNA
I did already. All the DNA

283
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:41,920
和指纹
and fingerprints from the crime scene

284
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:43,622
都属于Heather或者Dustin
all belong to Heather or Dustin.

285
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:46,191
我唯一发现的线索是在厨房洗碗槽里的
And the only trace I came up with was a foreign dirt sample

286
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:47,692
国外泥土样本 我在用
in the kitchen sink. I'm running that

287
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:49,194
-质谱仪分析检测 -犯罪现场的照片里
- through the Mass Spec right now. - What doesn't

288
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,699
有什么说不通的
make sense in the crime scene photos?

289
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:51,497
就
Just...

290
00:11:51,498 --> 00:11:53,364
看看这个混乱的场景 我是说
L-Look at this mess. I mean,

291
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:55,099
凶手一定是在找什么东西

00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:16,995
好了 你认识他吗
Okay, do you... do you recognize him?

432
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:19,030
仔细看 好吗
Look close, okay?

433
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,832
你为什么要闯入她的房子
Why did you break into her house?

434
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,500
我没有
I didn't.

435
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:25,670
我从没见过他的脸
I never saw his face.

436
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,273
好吧 你没有看到他
Okay. You didn't see him.

437
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,375
你听到他的声音了吗
Did you hear him?

438
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,279
听起来你想要奖品
Seems like a trophy you'd want.

439
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,447
我是被迫害的那个
I'm the one being persecuted here.

440
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,884
你们一看到我就认定我有罪
You guys decided I was guilty the second you laid eyes on me.

441
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,253
我才是那个被夺走一切的人
I'm the one who had everything taken away!

442
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,620
你们还说我偏执
And you call me paranoid.

443
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,856
有一个词来形容你
There is a word for what you are.

444
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,859
是这个人袭击了你阿姨么
Is this the man who attacked your aunt?

445
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,794
当你们认真考虑这件事的时候 在这种情况下
When you really think about it, I'm the victim

446
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,061
我才是受害者
in this situation.

447
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,329
我绝对不是杀人凶手
I'm definitely not a murderer.

448
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:55,064
听着 你是对的 好吧
Listen, you're right... Okay.

449
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:58,367
我是在跟踪Heather 行了吧 但我只做了这些
...I was following Heather, okay? But that's all I did.

450
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:01,404
我最后一次看到Heather是几天前的一个晚上
Last time I saw Heather was a couple nights ago.

451
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,306
她越过音乐学院的围墙
She jumped the fence at the music academy

452
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,408
进入一片建筑工地 几分钟后她回来了
into a construction site. Came back a few minutes later

453
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,910
身上有泥 我知道的就这些
covered in dirt. That's all I know.

454
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:09,278
有人能证明
Anyone to confirm

455
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,847
Heather那天晚上在音乐学院吗
Heather at the music academy that night?

456
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,849
有的
Yeah.

457
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:15,583
有个孩子跟她一起
There was a kid with her.

458
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:18,053
坐在副驾驶的位置
In the passenger seat.

459
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,231
Dustin说不是 他不是凶手
Dustin says no, he is not the killer.

460
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:32,287
要我说我们就按规矩把那个卑鄙小人关一会
I say we keep that creep in there awhile just on principle.

461
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:33,836
嘿 亲爱的
Hey, honey,

462
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:37,638
你阿姨有没有在晚上带你去过音乐学院
did your aunt ever take you to the music academy at night?

463
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:41,407
你阿姨曾在晚上带你
Did your aunt ever take you

464
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:43,076
去过音乐学院吗
to the academy after dark?

465
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:46,112
知道为什么吗
Any idea why?

466
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:49,282
不
No.

467
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:51,051
好吧
Okay.

468
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:56,056
这孩子已经经历了很多打击
Kid's been through a lot.

469
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:57,790
得给他找个指导老师
Might be worth getting him a counselor.

470
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,092
也许吧 但他对你比较有好感 Pride
Maybe. But he's warming up to you, Pride.

471
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:02,761
我可能有办法跟他沟通
May have an idea how to reach out to him.

472
00:20:02,763 --> 00:20:04,463
好吧 我们要去音乐学院了
Well, we'll go to the music academy.

473
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:06,332
看看Heather对什么这么感兴趣
See what was so compelling to Heather.

474
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,133
好了 我们去了
All right, we're on it.

475
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,910
Gregorio 醒醒
Gregorio, wake up.

476
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:20,678
你的思绪好像飘到百万英里之外了
Like you're a million miles away.

477
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,552
没那么远
Not that far.

478
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:23,415
我现在需要你
I need you present right now.

479
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,884
嘿 我不知道你为什么把我从NCIS拉回来了
Hey, I'm not sure why you pulled me from NCIS.

480
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:29,387
我们已经好几周没有收到Ciudad Natal的有效信息了
We've had no valid info on Ciudad Natal in weeks.

481
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:31,922
你这么说并不准确
That's not exactly accurate.

482
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,324
陪我走走
Walk with me.

483
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:36,760
贩毒集团的巨额现金在过去几个月中
A significant amount of cartel cash has been flooding

484
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:38,428
不断涌入新奥尔良
into New Orleans over the last few months.

485
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,230
上千万 或者更多
Tens of millions. Maybe more.

486
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:43,100
你是说新奥尔良被用来洗贩毒的黑钱
You saying New Orleans is being used to launder drug money?

487
00:20:43,102 --> 00:20:45,235
不仅仅是洗钱 贩毒集团在扎根
Not just laundering. The cartel's laying down roots,

488
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:47,948
经营合法生意 创建操作基地
funding legitimate businesses. Creating a base of operations.

489
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:50,941
有线索指向是谁在洗黑钱吗
Any leads on who's running this laundering operation?

490
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:52,174
也许
Maybe.

491
00:20:52,176 --> 00:20:55,244
具体细节还不清楚
Details are sketchy.

492
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:57,446
你有12个小时来快速进入状况
You have 12 hours to get up to speed.

493
00:20:57,448 --> 00:20:59,115
明天动身去华盛顿
Leave tomorrow for D.C.

494
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:02,418
我们在给主任和司法部长做简报
We're briefing the director and the attorney general.

495
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,487
假设你没有任何感恩节计划
That's assuming you don't have any Thanksgiving plans.

496
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:07,455
我
Well, all I...

497
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:09,090
Gregorio 这是个玩笑
It's a joke, Gregorio.

498
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:10,258
我知道你没有计划
I know you don't have plans.

499
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,395
长官 事实上 我有计划
Actually, sir, I do have something.

500
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:18,199
在过去的两个月里你一直渴望回到华盛顿
You've been itching to get back to D.C. for the last two months.

501
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:20,601
现在我正给你机会 去跟司法部
Now I'm offering you face time

502
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:23,404
两个最重要的会晤
with the two most important people at DOJ.

503
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:26,006
这时你应该感谢我
This is the part where you thank me,

504
00:21:26,008 --> 00:21:28,475
并询问我们什么时候动身去机场
ask what time do we leave for the airport.

505
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:31,045
-长官 谢谢你 -不客气
- Thank you, sir. - You're welcome.

506
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:40,886
目前 我知道这儿看起来不大
<i>Now, I know it doesn't</i> <i>look like much,</i>

507
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:42,688
但是 呃 这都是我的
but, um, it's all mine.

508
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:45,325
最精彩的部分是
Best part of it is,

509
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:49,395
我想什么时候弹琴就什么时候弹 想弹多大声就弹多大声
I can play anytime I want, as loud as I want,

510
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:51,431
想弹多久就弹多久
as long as I want.

511
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,767
我想你可能知道这首
I think you might know this one.

512
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:07,346
'始于坏时迹'
"Born Under a Bad Sign."

513
00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:08,613
你弹得真好
You're good.

514
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:10,115
没有你好
Not as good as you are.

515
00:22:10,117 --> 00:22:11,616
自从我在音乐学院听到你演奏它
The song's been stuck in my head

516
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:13,518
这首歌就浮现在我脑海里
since I heard you play it at the academy.

517
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,053
像你这个年纪的孩子没几个喜欢老式的布鲁斯
Not many kids your age like old-time blues.

518
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:18,889
嘿 快速思考一下
Hey. Think fast.

519
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:21,359
Booker T. Jones还是Eric Clapton
Booker T. Jones or Eric Clapton?

520
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:23,494
一直都是Booker T.
Booker T. all the way.

521
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:26,964
你知道吗 我在这家酒吧里看过他现场演奏
You know, I saw him play live in this bar,

522
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:28,732
就在这个舞台上
on this very stage.

523
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:30,101
-真的吗 -真的
- For real? - For real.

524
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:32,102
当时我没比现在的你大很多
When I was not much older than you.

525
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:34,404
我妈妈是名歌手
My mama was a singer.

526
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:36,306
和一些最好的歌手一起演唱
Sang with some of the best.

527
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:39,242
我的妈妈在船上
My mama's on the ship.

528
00:22:39,244 --> 00:22:41,077
我想她
I miss her.

529
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:44,780
我也想我的妈妈
I miss my mama, too.

530
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:46,616
有段时间没有看到她了
Haven't seen her in a while.

531
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:48,717
但是无论何时我弹起钢琴
But whenever I play the piano...

532
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,988
我会觉得离她近了一些
...I feel closer to her.

533
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,657
我们可以演奏 如果你 如果你觉得行的话
We could play if you...if you feel up to

534
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,233
来吧
Come on.

535
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:07,135
你说呢
What do you say?

536
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,582
你还好吧
You okay?

537
00:23:57,584 --> 00:23:59,784
嗯
Yeah.

538
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:02,520
瞧 我们得谈谈昨天晚上
Look, we need to talk about last night.

539
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:07,925
我知道你害怕
I know you're scared.

540
00:24:07,927 --> 00:24:09,827
我阿姨告诉我要勇敢
My aunt told me to be brave.

541
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:12,530
你做得很好
And you're doing great.

542
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,667
我知道她想要你的帮助
And I know she'd want you to help.

543
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:23,707
告诉我们发生了什么
Tell us what happened.

544
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:25,675
我躲起来了
I was hiding.

545
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:27,877
我没有真切的看到任何东西
I didn't really see anything.

546
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:32,014
'没有真切的看到'意味着你可能看到了一些
"Didn't really see" means maybe you saw a little bit?

547
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:35,351
我本该做些什么
I should have done something.

548
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:37,353
去帮助她
Helped her.

549
00:24:37,355 --> 00:24:38,954
没有什么
There was nothing...

550
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:42,658
Dustin 那时你做不了什么
nothing you could have done then, Dustin.

551
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,094
但是现在 跟我一起
But now, with me,

552
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:47,729
你可以有所作为
you can make a difference.

553
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:50,232
我敢打赌如果你听过一首歌
I bet if you hear a song once,

554
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:54,202
你可以立即演奏它
you can instantly play it.

555
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:56,238
对吧 嗯
Right? Yeah.

556
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,739
所以这个就像那样
So this is just like that.

557
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:01,109
我知道你能做到
I know, I know you can do it.

558
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,648
他对她大喊大叫
He wa-- he was yelling at her.

559
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,749
在哪里
Where is it?

560
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:13,187
她让他滚出去
She told him to get out.

561
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:15,055
威胁说要报警
Threatened to call the cops.

562
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:16,957
我要报警
I'm calling the cops.

563
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:20,461
就在那时他们打起来了
That's when they started to fight.

564
00:25:20,463 --> 00:25:22,862
然后他用拳打她
And then he punched her.

565
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:31,237
打得很重
He punched her hard.

566
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,493
我这是第三次尝试给Melody打电话了
<i>It's the third time I've tried</i> <i>contacting Melody.</i>

567
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:56,227
没回应
<i>No response.</i>

568
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:58,229
-什么情况 -也许她带着宝宝
- What's up with that? - Maybe she's taking the baby

569
00:25:58,231 --> 00:26:00,431
在哪儿散步或者打盹儿呢
for a walk or a nap.

570
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,999
不管怎样 你应该庆幸
Anyway, you should be glad

571
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,068
她没窃听你啊 居家好男人
she's not bugging you, family man.

572
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,250
这倒是个新称呼
That's a new name for me.

573
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:07,138
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

574
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:09,106
小孩儿还是挺让你抓狂的 是吧
Kid's still freaking you out, huh?

575
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:11,475
有一个学习过程 那是没错的
Well, there's a learning curve, that's for sure,

576
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:13,276
但是一个可爱的小家伙
but he is a lovable fella.

577
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:14,678
那个女孩儿呢
And the girl?

578
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,215
她也很可爱吗
She's lovable, too?

579
00:26:18,217 --> 00:26:20,684
Melody 还好吧 只是
Melody? Sure. It's just...

580
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:23,320
几年前我们有过一段幸福时光
We had a good time a couple years back,

581
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:25,154
但我那时不一样
but I was a different guy then.

582
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:27,490
她绝对不是我想要的结婚对象
She's definitely not my idea of a wife.

583
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:29,058
她没必要非得跟你结婚
She doesn't have to be your wife.

584
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,693
你只需要给她支持
You just have to have her back.

585
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:33,161
照顾好小孩儿 对吧
Care for the kid. Right?

586
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:36,398
Melody想要的绝对不止这些
Melody definitely wants more from me than that.

587
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,901
问题是 你想要什么
The question is, what do you want?

588
00:26:41,872 --> 00:26:44,039
我想要知道墙背面发生了什么
I want to know what's going on behind this fence.

589
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,774
-NCIS -等等 等一下
- NCIS. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.

590
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:47,141
我是好人 别开枪 噢
I'm a good guy. Hold on. Ow!

591
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:50,411
Sebastian 你在这里干什么呢
Sebastian. What are you doing here?

592
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:53,448
希望没有内出血
Hopefully not bleeding internally.

593
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,816
我想我摔在我的钥匙上了
I think I landed on my keys.

594
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:57,918
谢谢
Thank you.

595
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,087
我在受害者家里
I found a strange soil sample

596
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:01,422
发现了可疑的泥土样本
in the victim's house.

597
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:03,690
分析结果是多氯联苯
Analysis came back with evidence of PCBs.

598
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:05,158
就是那种
Stuff they used for insulation

599
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,593
以前用来绝缘电子设备的东西
for electrical equipment back in the day.

600
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:08,027
有毒 对吧
Really toxic, right?

601
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:09,329
是的 从上世纪80年代就禁用了
Yeah. It's been banned since the '80s.

602
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:11,030
无论如何 我查过Heather的物品
Anyway, I checked Heather's property,

603
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:13,233
没有类似毒性的痕迹
no sign of the same levels of toxicity,

604
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:14,701
所以我觉得我应该到她最近去过的所有地方
so I figured I'd come to all the places

605
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:17,137
取一些样本回来
she's been to recently and gather some samples.

606
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:18,438
好吧 但你可以给我们打电话
Yeah, but you could have called us.

607
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,973
我们可以给你带样本
We would have brought you a sample.

608
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:21,006
不用了 能出外勤挺好的
Nah, it's good to get out in the field.

609
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,941
你知道吗 离开实验室
You know? Away from the lab.

610
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:24,343
呼吸新鲜空气
Breathe in the fresh air,

611
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,044
即便这里充满致命的气体
even if it's filled with deadly fumes.

612
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:27,846
哇哦 这东西有多危险
Whoa. How dangerous is this stuff?

613
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,348
从1到致命之间打分的话
Well, on a scale from one to lethal?

614
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,783
即使是有限的接触
Even limited exposure can lead

615
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:32,285
也会引起严重的呼吸系统疾病
to serious respiratory illnesses.

616
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:34,086
我可没骗你
It's, it's the real deal.

617
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:41,959
-Pride -出了点问题 King
- Pride. - Got a problem, King.

618
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:44,596
似乎Heather在Dustin学校后边的
It looks like Heather found sediment containing PCBs

619
00:27:44,598 --> 00:27:45,963
沉积物里发现了多氯联苯
behind Dustin's school.

620
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,532
这可能是她被害的原因
It could be the reason she was killed--

621
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:48,966
好让她闭嘴
to keep her quiet.

622
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,669
多氯联苯会让人生病吗
PCBs can make someone sick?

623
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,236
没错 它会影响呼吸系统
Yeah. It affects the respiratory system,

624
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,672
尤其是孩子们
especially in kids.

625
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,240
好吧 好的 我得挂了
Okay. Good. I-I-I got to go.

626
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,244
Dustin 哦 不
Dustin... Oh, no.

627
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,380
哦 不 我得把你送到医院去
Oh, no. We got to get you to the hospital.

628
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:06,049
撑住 撑住
I got you, I got you.

629
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:19,214
这里有医生
There's a doctor here.

630
00:28:19,216 --> 00:28:21,715
行么 很安全
All right? Secure.

631
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:27,021
Dustin现在没事了
Dustin's okay now.

632
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:30,391
但是他的血液检测显示多氯联苯呈阳性
But his blood test came back positive for PCBs.

633
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:31,893
这跟Sebastian在Dustin学校后边的工地里
That's the same toxin Sebastian found

634
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:33,560
发现的毒物是一样的
at the construction site by Dustin's school.

635
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:35,729
是的 医院方面
Yeah. Hospital's contacting

636
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:37,731
正在联系其他学生来做测试
the other students for testing.

637
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,966
这可能就是那么多学生得病的原因
Probably why so many of them got sick.

638
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,467
医生说
Doc says that

639
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,137
Dustin的哮喘会加重感染
Dustin's asthma exacerbated his reaction.

640
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,738
幸运的是 还是能治好的
Luckily, it's treatable.

641
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,441
音乐学校已经在那里20多年了
Music academy's been on that location for 20 years.

642
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:50,777
这种事情从未发生过
Nothing like this ever happened before.

643
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,246
可能是工地工人在进行发掘的时候
Well, maybe the construction workers uncovered the PCBs

644
00:28:53,248 --> 00:28:54,580
把多氯联苯挖出来了
when excavating the site.

645
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:56,048
或者是他们带过来的
Or they brought it in with them.

646
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,750
无论如何 Heather发现了问题
Either way, Heather discovered the problem,

647
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,719
在公之于众前 她被杀了
killed before she could expose it.

648
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,789
让孩子们避免受到日常伤害
It's hard enough keeping them safe

649
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,824
就很困难了
from the normal worries of life,

650
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:09,328
现在还要担心他们的学校是不是建在有毒垃圾上
and then you've got to wonder if their school's on a toxic dump?

651
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:13,631
真够呛
That's a lot.

652
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:16,901
听着
Look...

653
00:29:16,903 --> 00:29:20,471
照顾他们 尽自己所能
You take care of them the best you can.

654
00:29:20,473 --> 00:29:23,741
教会他们怎么照顾自己
Teach them how to take care of themselves.

655
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:27,312
这需要付出 无眠的夜晚
It takes work, sleepless nights,

656
00:29:27,314 --> 00:29:29,712
和坚定的信念
a lot of faith.

657
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:32,916
你是怎么平衡这一切的 King
How did you balance it out, King?

658
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:37,654
工作 婚姻 抚养Laurel
Working, marriage, raising Laurel?

659
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:41,258
尽自己所能
You do your best.

660
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,560
有时候你会失败
Sometimes you fail.

661
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:46,895
我现在还是每天都会担心Laurel
I still worry about Laurel every day.

662
00:29:48,466 --> 00:29:51,600
这是你作为父亲的礼物
Gift of fatherhood.

663
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:59,175
接下来我们怎么做 King
What's our next move, King?

664
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:01,344
需要查清那些有毒沉积物
Need to figure out the origin

665
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:03,044
从何而来
of the toxic sediment.

666
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:05,113
这也许会让我们找到杀害Heather的凶手
It could lead us to Heather's killer.

667
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:08,183
好吗
Okay.

668
00:30:09,652 --> 00:30:11,453
从工地
<i>Dirt pulled</i>

669
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:13,821
取回的泥土只有微量的多氯联苯
from the construction site had only trace amounts of PCBs.

670
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:15,556
这点儿剂量都不能感染一个孩子
And there's not enough there to get one kid sick,

671
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:17,025
更别说一半的学生了
let alone half the student body.

672
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:18,293
但是建筑工人们
But the construction crews

673
00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:20,060
前几天还在学校
were working overtime at the school

674
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:22,629
加班加点地工作 我见到了推土机的迹象
the last day or so; I saw the bulldozer tracks.

675
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:24,598
也许他们移走了有毒土壤
Maybe they moved the toxic soil.

676
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,266
如果他们在处理多氯联苯
Well, if they were dealing with PCBs,

677
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:27,934
那他们需要办理一堆安全许可证
then they would have had to pull a ton of safety permits.

678
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:29,436
而且他们在完成之前
And they definitely wouldn't have allowed kids

679
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:31,338
绝对不应该让孩子们出现在附近
to be anywhere nearby until it was all cleared.

680
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,639
那就是他们在非法转运
Then they moved it illegally.

681
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:34,541
好的 Heather发现了这点
Okay. So Heather figured it out,

682
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:37,310
正准备去揭发他们 然后因此被害了
was gonna expose them, and got killed for it.

683
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,912
现在我们必须得找到那个建筑公司
We got to get to that construction company, now.

684
00:30:39,914 --> 00:30:41,208
-嗨 Sebastian -怎么
- Hey, Sebastian... - Yeah?

685
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:42,049
你要干啥
Whatcha doing?

686
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,516
我要跟踪下一个线索
I'm gonna follow the next lead.

687
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:45,618
这好像是我的活儿
That's kind of my thing.

688
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,121
你的工作是待在这里
Your thing's staying here,

689
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:50,323
分析证据 展现聪明才智 这才是你的活儿
analyzing evidence, crackin' wise, that's your thing.

690
00:30:50,325 --> 00:30:52,825
是啊 可是你要知道 我受够了证据分析
Yeah, but I'm-I'm-I'm tired of analyzing evidence, you know?

691
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:54,393
从来没能从头到尾看完一个案子
Never seeing a case through to the end.

692
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,261
如果你觉得不开心 做点改变
Well, if you're unhappy, make a change.

693
00:30:56,263 --> 00:30:57,896
-你是说辞职 -不是
- You mean like quit my job? - No.

694
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,697
我是说 比如 搞点业余爱好
I meant, like, taking up a hobby.

695
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:01,066
好吧 我不觉得那个
Yeah. I don't think that, uh,

696
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,901
高尔夫课程
golf lessons are gonna fill

697
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,404
可以填补我内心的空虚
the empty space inside me.

698
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:06,938
现在我们需要证实
Right now we need evidence

699
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,507
这个建筑公司转移了有毒废弃物
this construction company moved the toxic waste

700
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:10,308
以及Heather正要揭发他们
and Heather was trying to expose them.

701
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,243
我试过了 我是说 她的手机
I tried, though. I mean, her-her phone

702
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,610
和电脑都被清理干净了
and her computer were wiped,

703
00:31:13,612 --> 00:31:15,246
重置成了出厂状态
restored to factory settings.

704
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,114
我猜她去实验室测试过土壤
I assume that she went to a lab to test the soil,

705
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:18,849
但是没有证据证明这一点
but there's no proof of it.

706
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:20,918
要知道 这感觉像是凶手掩盖了他的踪迹
You know, it's like the killer covered all his tracks.

707
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,554
那建筑公司呢
What about the construction company?

708
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:26,290
那是Avery Builders和Dredging公司
Well, that's, uh, Avery Builders and Dredging.

709
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:28,291
它们在这里有几十年了
They've been around for decades.

710
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:30,026
但是最近被一个叫Javier Garcia的人
Uh, but they were recently purchased

711
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:31,394
收购了
by a guy named Javier Garcia.

712
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:33,229
好吧 谁是Javier Garcia
Okay. Who's Javier Garcia?

713
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:35,932
不知道 我们查查看
No idea. Let's see.

714
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:39,369
我们不是唯一对他好奇的人
We're not the only ones who are wondering.

715
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:41,438
我刚刚查了联邦数据库
I just searched the federal databases.

716
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,606
FBI也在查他
FBI's looking into him, too.

717
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:50,179
你看起来像是一个
You look like a woman in need

718
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:51,880
-需要救命稻草的人 卡布奇诺 -啊
- of a lifeline-- cappuccino - Ah...

719
00:31:51,882 --> 00:31:53,782
-和煎饼卷 -从Angelo Brocato买的
- and cannoli. - From Angelo Brocato?

720
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:54,950
-嗯哼 -你现在正式成为
- Mm-hmm. - You're officially

721
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:56,918
我最喜欢的人了
my favorite person.

722
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,120
需要一点小回馈
Need a little reciprocity.

723
00:31:58,122 --> 00:31:59,321
互惠互利
Sugar for sugar?

724
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:00,989
-想要什么 -关于Javier Garcia的
- What do you need? - Everything you got

725
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:02,590
一切信息
on Javier Garcia.

726
00:32:03,426 --> 00:32:05,059
好吧 抱歉
Yeah. Sorry.

727
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:06,627
办不了
No can do.

728
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,630
你开玩笑吗
You're kidding me.

729
00:32:09,632 --> 00:32:11,065
不 我没开玩笑 我不知道你们
No, I'm not. And I don't know how

730
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:13,000
是怎么知道他的 但是如果Isler知道了
you got that name, but if Isler finds out,

731
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:14,569
他会以为是我告诉你们的
he's gonna think I gave it to you.

732
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:16,437
为什么Isler会关心
Why does Isler care about toxic soil

733
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,805
当地音乐学校的有毒土壤呢
at a local music school?

734
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:19,439
等等 这是跟
Wait a minute. Is this connected

735
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:22,309
-Heather Cobb的谋杀案有关吗 -没错 我们认为
- to the Heather Cobb murder? - Yeah. We think she got hip

736
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,910
她知道了土壤里的多氯联苯
to the PCB's in the soil

737
00:32:23,912 --> 00:32:25,812
会导致孩子们生病 我们正在查
making the kids sick, started looking into

738
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:27,581
相关的建筑公司和挖掘公司
the construction and dredging company responsible.

739
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,881
它们属于Javier Garcia
Javier Garcia owns it.

740
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:30,817
Avery Builders公司 我们知道它的一切
Avery Builders. We know all about it.

741
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:32,185
听着 你们得让一让了
Listen, you need to back off.

742
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:34,621
这是什么国家机密吗
Is this some kind of state secret?

743
00:32:35,524 --> 00:32:37,356
这是贩毒集团的前哨
It's a cartel front.

744
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:40,058
可能是帮毒贩洗钱 尽管我们还不能证明这一点
Probably laundering drug money, though we can't prove it yet.

745
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,129
-所以Javier Garcia是个楔子 -他几个月前
- So Javier Garcia's an imbed? - He arrived in New Orleans

746
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:44,930
来到新奥尔良 一直在到处购买公司和地产
months ago, been buying companies and properties

747
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:46,898
他可能会成为
all over the city-- he's probably gonna

748
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,800
我们调查的新焦点
be our new focus in the investigation.

749
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,302
听着
Listen...

750
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:52,338
你们得跟他保持距离 Percy
you need to stay away, Percy.

751
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,872
Dustin还在医院 他的阿姨去世了
Dustin's in the hospital, his aunt is dead,

752
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:57,975
这个可能要为此负责的人我们不能碰么
and the man who may be responsible is off-limits?

753
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,145
得了 Gregorio
Come on, Gregorio,

754
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:02,180
你知道我们不可能保持距离
you know we're not staying away.

755
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:04,349
你也不会
And you wouldn't, either.

756
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:10,395
特别探员Pride 对吗
Special Agent Pride, right?

757
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:12,530
是的 Garcia先生
That's right, Mr. Garcia.

758
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,900
我们有搜查令 搜查你的办公室
We have a warrant to search your offices.

759
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:18,803
听起来很官方啊 你们在找什么
Sounds very official. What are you looking for?

760
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:20,738
在克雷森特市音乐学校
Evidence of mishandling toxic soil

761
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,490
违规处理有毒土壤的证据
at the Crescent City Music Academy.

762
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:23,775
还有Heather Cobb
As well as evidence

763
00:33:23,776 --> 00:33:25,877
被杀的证据 -我们走
- about Heather Cobb's murder. - Let's go.

764
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,879
如果你认为我和学校的这场悲剧有关联
Well, if you think I had anything to do with that tragedy

765
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,148
那你就太不了解我了
at the school, you don't know me very well.

766
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,383
我确实对你一无所知 Garcia先生
I don't know you at all, Mr. Garcia.

767
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:34,718
但我们在你的建筑工地上
But we found PCB's

768
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,286
发现了多氯联苯
at your construction site.

769
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:37,888
Heather Cobb也发现了 而且你知道
Heather Cobb did, too, and you know

770
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,456
-她遭遇了什么 -我的儿子也在
- what happened to her. - My son goes

771
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,790
那所学校
to that school.

772
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:42,159
他和其他孩子一样都是受害者
He's under a doctor's care

773
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:43,660
因为呼吸道感染
for a respiratory infection,

774
00:33:43,662 --> 00:33:45,895
正在接受医生的治疗
as much a victim as the other children.

775
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:46,728
但这是你的建筑公司
This is your construction company.

776
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:49,565
我有很多公司 但是我不能天天守着它们
I own many companies-- don't run the day-to-day.

777
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,734
我也是刚发现多氯联苯的事
I just found out about the PCB's.

778
00:33:51,736 --> 00:33:55,037
这就是我来这的原因 来控制局势
That's why I'm here-- to handle the situation.

779
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,077
King 来看看这个
King. Take a look at this.

780
00:34:05,015 --> 00:34:08,183
我在橱柜里找到了这个
I found this inside that cabinet.

781
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:09,584
Heather的小号箱子
Heather's trumpet case.

782
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,887
在这里面 有个装泥土的容器
Inside, a container of dirt,

783
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,788
和一份实验室报告
along with... lab report.

784
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,723
是从Heather家里拿走的
Taken from Heather's house.

785
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:21,028
这是昨天我在学校见到和你在一起的人
This is the man I saw you with yesterday at the school.

786
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,930
Theo Beattie 我的工头
Theo Beattie, my foreman.

787
00:34:22,932 --> 00:34:24,858
我从昨天开始就在调查此事
I-I've been looking into this since yesterday.

788
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:28,293
看上去Theo用了不合格的材料来削减开支
Seems Theo used substandard materials to cut costs.

789
00:34:28,295 --> 00:34:29,497
造成了土壤污染
Contaminated soil.

790
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:30,630
你知道他在哪吗
You know where he is?

791
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:32,130
他本应在这里等我
He's supposed to be here waiting for me.

792
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:33,665
我本来是要和他解决这件事
I was going to deal with him.

793
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:36,100
我发现了这封Theo试图删掉的邮件
I found this e-mail that Theo tried to delete.

794
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:37,602
是Heather Cobb发给他的
It's from Heather Cobb.

795
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:40,405
她因为孩子们生病的事情和他对峙
She confronted him about kids getting sick.

796
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:42,607
她想去环保署投诉
Was going to the EPA.

797
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:44,409
这家伙消失了 King
The guy's in the wind, King.

798
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:46,544
很可能现在在墨西哥呢
Probably in Mexico by now.

799
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:49,947
他如果想逃出我的手掌心 就得逃得更远些
He'll have to go further than that if he wants to escape me.

800
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,852
我们会来处理Theo Beattie的
Uh, we'll take care of Theo Beattie.

801
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:58,855

804
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:05,929
怎么了 King
What's up, King?

805
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:08,498
始于坏时迹
"Born Under a Bad Sign."

806
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,434
是Dustin一直在吹奏的那首歌
It's the song Dustin's been playing the whole time.

807
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:13,201
却是Theo的铃声
Theo's ringtone?

808
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:15,137
原来这是他一直想要告诉我的
That's what he's been trying to tell me.

809
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:16,705
只是太害怕不敢说出来
Just too scared to say it.

810
00:35:16,707 --> 00:35:18,607
或许他在案发当晚听到了这首歌
Maybe he heard it the night of the murder.

811
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,610
说明Dustin可以指控Theo曾出现在案发现场
Which means Dustin can put Theo at the crime scene.

812
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:23,712
我们得赶紧去医院
We got to get to the hospital.

813
00:35:25,716 --> 00:35:27,515
给我进去 现在
Get inside. Now.

814
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:32,620
不许出声
Not a sound.

815
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:46,536
目前有哪些信息
What do we know?

816
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:47,804
Theo Beattie潜进了医院
Theo Beattie snuck into the hospital,

817
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:49,204
偷了清洁工的衣服和身份证件
stole scrubs and an ID,

818
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:50,262
拔走了守卫的枪
pulled a gun on the guard.

819
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:51,004
他们现在在哪
Where are they now?

820
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:53,374
Theo带走了Dustin 目前还不知去向
Theo took Dustin. There's no sign of 'em. Yet.

821
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:54,810
跑不了多远的 Theo把那孩子带走后
Couldn't have gotten far. Hospital went on lockdown

822
00:35:54,812 --> 00:35:57,378
医院封闭了出口 他们应该就在医院里
minutes after Theo took the kid. They got to be here somewhere.

823
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,313
我以为你不再和我们一起办案了
I thought you weren't supposed to play with us.

824
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:01,115
我能说什么 我就是离不开你
What can I say, I just can't quit you.

825
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,449
来吧 Dustin 你在哪里
Come on, Dustin, where are you?

826
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,084
Pride 每个出口都有警察
Look, Pride, there are cops at every exit.

827
00:36:04,086 --> 00:36:05,953
我们会找到他们的
We will find them.

828
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,257
我想我们找到了
Think we just did.

829
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:12,359
我们走 Gregorio 你跟着我
Let's go. Gregorio, with me.

830
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:13,894
Lasalle Percy 你们走右边过道
Lasalle, Percy, right hallway.

831
00:36:21,736 --> 00:36:23,870
NCIS 站住
NCIS! Stop!

832
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:25,538
Theo
Theo.

833
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,605
放开那个男孩 他生病了
Let the boy go. He's sick.

834
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:27,841
他需要在医院里呆着
Needs to be in the hospital.

835
00:36:27,843 --> 00:36:30,643
你也不想要再伤害任何人了
You do not want to hurt anybody else.

836
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:32,510
离我远点
Stay away from me.

837
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:34,713
那是个意外
It was an accident.

838
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:36,425
你觉得你对他造成的伤害还不够吗
Haven't you done enough to him already?

839
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:38,351
我并不知道那土是有毒的
I didn't know that soil was toxic.

840
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:40,418
她甚至不给我机会去补救
She didn't give me a chance to fix it.

841
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,653
你是在怪Heather Cobb吗
You're saying Heather Cobb's to blame?

842
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:43,121
她想去举报我
She was gonna report me.

843
00:36:43,123 --> 00:36:44,489
我不得不阻止她
I-I had to keep her quiet.

844
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:46,225
我一直是个好人

866

我是特别探员Dwayne Pride

868
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:02,762
你救了我儿子

我真不知道该怎么感谢你

把他的第一张专辑发给我吧

我会让他给你签上名的

872
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,342
并不是什么礼节 但是
Not exactly protocol, but...

873
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:18,244
我从物证处那里拿到了
I got Heather's trumpet

874
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:20,012
Heather的喇叭
released from evidence.

875
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:22,881
我觉得你应该拿着它 Dustin
Think you should have it, Dustin.

876
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,551
算是一个提醒 为了你的阿姨继续演奏

877

你也要一直演奏下去

883
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:53,110
我觉得Isler一定很好奇
I figured Isler would be wondering

884
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:55,312
-你现在到底在哪 -或许吧
- where you are about now. - Probably.

885
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:57,781
我只是想完整地跟进这个案子
I just wanted to see this case through.

886
00:38:57,783 --> 00:38:59,316
嗯
Hm.

887
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:01,852
可别变成陌生人了 Gregorio

888

跟我解释下吧
Explain something to me.

889
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:25,273
我让你在Natal贩毒集团的调查中担任要职
I put you front and center on the Ciudad Natal investigation.

890
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:26,774
这对职业生涯有重大影响
Career-making case.

891
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:29,344
而你却放下一切去帮NCIS
Yet you drop everything to help NCIS.

892
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:30,745
他们人手不够 -更别说
They were shorthanded. - Not to mention

893
00:39:30,747 --> 00:39:32,414
你几乎要在Javier Garcia那儿暴露我们了
almost exposing us to Javier Garcia.

894
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,782
他完全不知道我们怀疑他和贩毒集团有关系
He has no idea we suspect him of cartel ties.

895
00:39:34,784 --> 00:39:37,685
我认为Theo Beattie可能会有他的证据
I thought Theo Beattie might provide evidence against him.

896
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:39,153
那个建筑工人
The construction worker?

897
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:41,522
那个把有毒废物丢弃在学校的人吗 可不见得
Who dumped the toxic waste at the school? Not likely.

898
00:39:41,524 --> 00:39:43,424
他和贩毒集团的生意并没有联系
He wasn't involved in cartel business.

899
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:47,361
我不得不问问 Gregorio
I got to ask, Gregorio--

900
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:49,596
你在FBI开心吗
are you happy at FBI?

901
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:55,102
老实说 先生
Honestly, sir...

902
00:39:55,104 --> 00:39:57,203
我不知道
I don't know.

903
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:05,178
好吧 你最好尽快想清楚
Well, you better figure it out quick,

904
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,113
因为还有几个小时 我们就要去华盛顿特区了
because we head for D.C. in a couple of hours,

905
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,215
而我需要知道你到底属于哪个团队
and I need to know whose team you're on.

906
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,858
说真的 我很惊讶
<i>I'll be honest. I'm surprised.</i>

907
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,660
我知道你最近不太满意
I know you haven't been satisfied lately,

908
00:40:21,662 --> 00:40:23,795
但这确实是生命中的大转变
but this is a big life change.

909
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,631
你确定你准备好了吗
You sure you're ready for it?

910
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,368
其实 我并不知道我有没有准备好
Well, I-I don't know if I'm ready for it,

911
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:33,304
但是我知道 我需要这么做
but I know I... I need to give it a shot.

912
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,040
-我想成为团队的一员 -你就是团队的一员
- I want to be part of the team. - You are part of the team.

913
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:38,576
我知道 我知道 而且实验室的工作是有奖励的
I know, I know, and lab work is... rewarding.

914
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:40,445
或者说 曾经是
Or... it used to be.

915
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:41,845
我只是
I just...

916
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:44,648
我不知道 我觉得我可以
I don't know, I-I feel like I can...

917
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,750
做得更多 我想做
offer more. I want to do

918
00:40:46,752 --> 00:40:49,119
-你们做的工作 -这份工作很难的 Sebastian
- what you guys do. - It's a hard job, Sebastian.

919
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:50,954
是 听着 这不是我的一时兴起 好吗
Yeah, look, this is not a whim, okay?

920
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:52,322
我已经提交了
I already submitted my application

921
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,690
成为一名特别探员的申请 我 我
to be a special agent-- I-I...

922
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:55,792
我已经下决心了 我
I am all in. I was, uh,

923
00:40:55,794 --> 00:40:58,195
其实有些 希望
actually kind of... hoping that...

924
00:40:58,197 --> 00:41:01,030
或许我可以得到一封推荐信
maybe I could get a recommendation?

925
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:02,732
培训是很难的 Sebastian
Training is tough, Sebastian.

926
00:41:02,734 --> 00:41:04,633
比你之前经历过的任何事都要难
Tougher than anything you've ever been through before,

927
00:41:04,635 --> 00:41:06,235
但是如果你通过了
but if you pass...

928
00:41:06,237 --> 00:41:08,637
我会给你比推荐信更有价值的东西
I'll give you more than a recommendation,

929
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,307
我会给你这份工作
I'll give you a job.

930
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:13,275
我的天 真的吗
Oh, my God, really?

931
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:16,645
是的 Sebastian 当然是真的

932
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:18,547
毕竟 你是家里人啊
