1
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:12,274
房间很漂亮 真棒
Nice room, fancy.

2
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:13,058
还不错
It's not bad.

3
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:14,659
我进城就住在这儿 所以
I stay here whenever I'm in town, so...

4
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:16,127
真棒 宝贝
That's nice, baby.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,695
现在 我们把烦人的外套脱掉
Now, let's get that silly jacket off.

6
00:00:17,697 --> 00:00:18,896
也许
Maybe...

7
00:00:18,898 --> 00:00:21,099
我赌50块他会临阵退缩
50 bucks says he chickens out.

8
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:23,400
不可能 他可是花了快一个月的薪水
No way. He just shelled out like a month's salary.

9
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:25,302
-他已经装弹上膛了 -他有点头大
- He's locked and loaded. - He's way over his head.

10
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:26,770
看看他有多不安
Look how fidgety he is.

11
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:28,639
这是他第一次找应召女郎
It's his first time with a working girl.

12
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:30,240
你还懂点读心术么
You're some kind of mind reader?

13
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:32,643
我们已经看过上百万条这种视频了
We've watched a million videos like this,

14
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:35,311
赋予了我烦人的洞察男性心理的能力
giving me disturbing insight into the male psyche.

15
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:36,379
我们进入正题吧
Let's get to business.

16
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:38,615
真的吗 哇哦
Really? Whoa...

17
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:43,452
不 等等
No, wait!

18
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:46,797
求你 你不必这样做
Please. You don't have to do this.

25

NCIS<font color=#00FF00>新奥尔良</font>S03<font color=#00FFFF>E13</font>

Whoever's there, identify yourself!

27
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:45,845
哦
Ow!

28
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:46,879
抱歉 是我
Sorry. It's me.

29
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:48,647
我是Sebastian
It's Sebastian.

30
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,849
第一天上班 有点儿兴奋
First day on the job, I got a little excited,

31
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:52,184
我睡不着 所以我想
I couldn't sleep, so I figured

32
00:01:52,186 --> 00:01:53,585
直接过来吧
I'd just come in.

33
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:54,953
现在是凌晨五点
At 5:00 in the morning.

34
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:56,487
我觉得过来屡一下头绪
Thought I'd just get a head start on things,

35
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,857
或许放一下 我的东西
maybe unpack my stuff.

36
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:03,394
噢 我该把东西放哪儿
Anyway, where should I put my stuff?

37
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:06,798
桌子还没给你送来 还在运送中
I haven't gotten you a desk yet. Still figuring out logistics.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,998
好的 好吧 没关系
Okay. All right, that's fine.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,333
我就 呃
I'll just, uh...

40
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:11,869
我就先拿着这些东西
I'll just hold onto this for now.

41
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:15,139
我们会给你找个地儿放
We'll find a place for you.

42
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:17,341
哦 肯定的 是啊 没错 我知道
Oh, totally. Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.

43
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:19,777
只是 我很焦虑 你知道吗
Just, I'm so nervous, you know?

44
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:22,012
就像 第一天来学校你谁都不认识
Like, first day at school and you don't know anyone

45
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:23,814
那样的焦虑 不过这很奇怪 对吧
kind of nervous, but that's strange, right?

46
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:25,281
因为我 我认识这里的每一个人
'Cause I, I know everyone here.

47
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:27,117
进入新工作都不简单
Never easy taking a new job.

48
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:29,352
尤其在一个有经验的队伍
Especially on an experienced team.

49
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:32,922
但是你来这儿是有原因的
But you're here for a reason.

50
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:36,226
你会做得很好 我保证
You'll do great. I promise.

51
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:38,128
另外
And...

52
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:42,397
我有件东西
...I got something

53
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,566
要给你
for you.

54
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:54,709
你的配枪
Your service weapon.

55
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,611

62
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:17,197
伙计 这样太冷漠了 抱歉
Man, that's insensitive. I'm sorry.

63
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,432
只是作为探员的第一个案子 你懂吧
Just first case as an agent, you know?

64
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:21,835

71
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,193
开枪

72
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,328
干掉了警卫
Takes out the guard,

73
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,762
Smith先生和Shaw上尉
Mr. Smith and Lt. Shaw?

74
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,664
这到底是什么地方
What exactly is this place?

75
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,567
-这是个联邦数据共享... -这是某种数据场地...
- It's a federal data sharing... - Well, some short of data farm...

76
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,269
抱歉 我 该我说吗
I'm sorry. Do--? Is it my turn?

77
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,705
只是想弄明白案件陈述礼节
Just trying to figure out the-the briefing etiquette.

78
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,674
说吧 我的朋友
Go for it, my friend.

79
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,476
好的 这是联邦服务器场
All right. It's a Federal server farm,

80
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:09,346
国防部和司法部的不同机构在这里分享和分析情报
where different agencies at DoD and DOJ share and analyze Intel.

81
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:11,348
没错 FBI CIA 海军情报部门
Yeah. FBI, CIA, Navy Intel--

82
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,283
所有这些部门都把他们的文件存在这儿
all of them store their files here.

83
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:14,952
高价值目标
High-value target.

84
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,954
可以假设数据已经被盗吗
Assuming data was stolen?

85
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,656
没错 根据记录日志 得有几十亿字节的信息被盗
Yeah. Over a thousand terabytes worth, according to this log.

86
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:23,460
我们面临的是国家安全的巨大漏洞
We're talking about a massive breach of national security.

87
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,995
哦 我有点儿接受不了
Oh! I just can't get over it.

88
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:28,430
嗷 你成长了呀
Aww. You're all grown up...

89
00:04:28,432 --> 00:04:30,199
好了 行了 我要工作呢
Okay. All right. You know, I'm trying to work here.

90
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,367
哦对 是啊 当然

91
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:33,402
第四个受害人在外面

也是中了两枪
Also shot twice.

93
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:37,106
我们要找几个嫌疑人
How many suspects we looking at?

94
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:38,474
呃 现在下结论有点早
Uh, it's too soon to tell,

95
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:40,176
但我敢说就一个人
but I'd say just one.

96
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:42,744
每个受害人都是胸前中了两枪
Each victim has a double tap to the chest.

97
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,679
他对武器非常熟练
Someone was very handy with a weapon.

98
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:46,181
对电子设备也很熟悉
Handy with electronics, too.

99
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:48,016
整个安全系统 包括监控

100
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:49,484
都被离线攻破
is taken offline.

101
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:53,421
哦 很抱歉
Oh. I'm sorry about that.

102
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:55,390
还在试图搞清楚时机问题
Trying to work out the timing, still.

103
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:59,159
好吧 好的 所以我们得知可能是一个人
Okay. All right. So we've got what could be one man

104
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:01,295
闯了进来
who breaks in,

105
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:04,164
没被发现 杀了四个人
undetected, kills four,

106
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,966
还窃取了大量
steals massive amounts

107
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:08,202
敏感的政府数据
of sensitive government data.

108
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:09,669
可能是间谍行为
Probably espionage.

109
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:12,273
应该尽快跟国防部和司法部谈谈
Should talk to DoD and DOJ, ASAP.

110
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:15,308
没错 我让Sonja和Gregorio马上联系他们
Yeah. I'll have Sonja and Gregorio contact them now.

111
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,877
同时 Christopher 你去
In the meantime, Christopher. Let's start--

112
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,078
-让一下 -嗯 好
- excuse me - Hmm? Yeah.

113
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,980
从该地区其它楼栋
pulling surveillance footage

114
00:05:20,982 --> 00:05:22,148
找一下监控录像
from other buildings in the area.

115
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,284
-没问题 -哦 我跟Lasalle一起去
- You got it. - Oh, I'll go with Lasalle.

116
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:25,919
不 不 不用 你不用去 你在这里
No, no, no. You're okay. You stay here.

117
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:28,854
跟Loretta一起工作 很多证据需要处理
Work with Loretta. Lot of evidence to process.

118
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:31,157
这是个好主意 而且不只是物理证据
That's a good idea. Not just physical evidence, either.

119
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:34,126
不论是谁干的 一定留下了数字痕迹
Whoever did this must've left a digital trace.

120
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:36,194
Patton出城去参加什么信息技术讨论会
Patton's out of town at some I.T. conference,

121
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:37,896
但我们或许应该联系一下他
but we should probably contact him.

122
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:40,198
好主意 现在就去做
Good idea. Do it now.

123
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,234
我们要在被盗数据落入敌手前
We need to find whoever did this

124
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:44,736
查出是谁干的
before the stolen data gets in the wrong hands.

125
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:53,577
看起来不太舒服
That just looks uncomfortable.

126
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,646
一切都好不自在
Everything about it.

127
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,383
我知道我们在NCIS比较随意
I know we keep it casual at NCIS,

128
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,118
但是看起来你们在拉低下限
but it seems like you're pushing it.

129
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,753
我们在工作呢
We're workin' here.

130
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:05,056
以为你们在联系国防部和司法部呢
Thought you were contacting DoD and DOJ.

131
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:07,023
两个部门都报告说两周前
Well, both agencies reported an attempted hack

132
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,791
有针对该机构的黑客攻击行为
of the facilities two weeks ago.

133
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:11,861
所以Shaw上尉被派来升级软件
That's why Lieutenant Shaw was sent here to update software,

134
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:13,396
增强网络防御能力
strengthen cyber defense.

135
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:14,897
知道谁是黑客吗
Any idea who the hacker was?

136
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:16,266
不知道 但我们猜测
None. But it's our guess,

137
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:17,867
和凶手是同一个人
it's the same person as the killer.

138
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,336
这是他窃取的部分内容
This is part of what he was stole.

139
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:21,304
FBI对一个
Surveillance from FBI

140
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:23,772
大型卖淫团伙的监控
of a major prostitution ring.

141
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:25,640
我认识他
I know him.

142
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:27,809
那是Long议员
It's Councilman Long.

143
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:29,044
你是怎么找到这个的
Well, how'd you find this?

144
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:30,346
我们没找 一小时前
We didn't. It went viral

145
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,613
它就在网络上扩散了
an hour ago.

146
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,415
一起被扩散的还有另外八个
A long with eight other videos

147
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:34,450
新奥尔良名人的视频
of prominent New Orleanians.

148
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:36,385
都是被盗文件的一部分
All a part of the stolen files.

149
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,320
每个目标都处于某种程度的
And each of our subjects are under some form

150
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,754
调查中
of investigation.

151
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:41,022
网上炸开了锅
Internet's blowing up.

152
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:42,556
视频有上千的点击量
Videos are getting thousands of hits.

153
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:44,825
这完全是公开羞辱
It's straight up public humiliation.

154
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:47,128
我听着不像间谍行为
Doesn't sound like espionage to me.

155
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,865
啊 嗨 新人呀
Ah, hey. It's the new guy.

156
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:52,766
我可以这么说 因为我已经来了一个星期
I can say that, 'cause I've been here a week.

157
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:54,802
欢迎加入 菜鸟
Welcome aboard, newbie.

158
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,070
你们有什么发现
You got something for us?

159
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:58,105
我在现场发现了一些上皮细胞
I'd say. Found epidermis cells

160
00:06:58,107 --> 00:07:01,308
但与受害人不匹配
at the scene that didn't match any of our victims.

161
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,776
与之匹配的嫌疑人是
But they did match a very likely suspect.

162
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:04,777
Ethan Beck
Ethan Beck.

163
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:06,579
Ethan Beck
Ethan Beck?

164
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:09,649
好吧 你们听说过匿名者 对吧
So. All right. So you've heard of Anonymous, right?

165
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:10,984
当然
Of course.

166
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:12,519
很好 Ethan Beck和他的手下
Okay. Well, Ethan Beck and his people

167
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,653
比匿名者要强十倍 他们的任务
are, like, ten times better. And their mission

168
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,123
就是揭露所有的腐败
is to expose corruption wherever it is.

169
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,590
那我们在哪儿能找到这家伙
So where do we find this guy?

170
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:20,159
问题来了 你根本找不到他
Well, that's the thing. You don't really find him.

171
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:23,329
只有他来找你 他就像 一个幽灵
He finds you. He's like a... like a phantom.

172
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:26,865
我现在很期待"但是"这个词
I'm expecting a"but" right about now.

173
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,835
但是 几个礼拜以前
But there was a failed hack attempt on the facility

174
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:31,102
有未遂黑客攻击行为
a couple weeks back...

175
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:32,303
Patton已经找出
And Patton was able to find out

176
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:33,804
黑客入侵的位置
where that hack came from.

177
00:07:33,806 --> 00:07:36,141
我现在就把具体细节发给你
And I'm gonna send you those details right now.

178
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,478
在庞恰特雷恩湖的一家废弃餐馆
The abandoned restaurant on Lake Pontchartrain.

179
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,081
事实上 IP地址现在还处于活跃状态
Yeah. Actually, there's activity on the I.P. address right now.

180
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,315
现在还有人在那儿
Somebody's still there.

181
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,517
可能是凶手
Could be our killer.

182
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,485
Gregorio 你和我一起
Gregorio, you're with me.

183
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,964
海军罪案调查处
NCIS!

184
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:02,266
举起手来 让我们看见
Hands where we can see 'em.

185
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:03,667
慢点
Slow!

186
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:11,074
Elvis
Elvis!

187
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,377
Dwayne Pride
Dwayne Pride.

188
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,779
世界上有那么多城镇 城镇里又有那么多酒馆 瞧
Of all the gin joints in all the towns, and look,

189
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:18,041
你还带上了小伙计
you brought your little buddy with you, too.

190
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:18,782
早该猜到的
Should've guessed,

191
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:21,050
要是我们有黑客的工作 肯定让你来做
if we had a major hack job, we'd run into you.

192
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:22,684
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

193
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:24,986
这看上去对我很不利
This looks really bad for me.

194
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:27,556
但这次我发誓 不是我干的
but this time I swear I did not do it.

195
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:29,057
好吧
Right.

196
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:48,022
把手放到我能看到的地方
Hands where I can see 'em.

197
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:50,258
我有种强烈的似曾相识的感觉
I am having a raging bout of déjà vu right now.

198
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,916
Dwayne 告诉她我并不危险
Dwayne, tell her I'm not dangerous.

199
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,484
上次我们和你打交道的时候 你带着武器
Last time we dealt with you, you were armed

200
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:54,651
还差点射中一个女人
and almost shot a woman.

201
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,052
她说得没错 Elvis
She's got a point, Elvis.

202
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:58,054
不考虑具体情况 不公平
Out of context, unfair.

203
00:08:58,056 --> 00:09:00,023
当时是那女人冲着我枪口来的
And that woman sort of had it coming.

204
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:01,525
请问 我能把他铐起来吗
Can I cuff him, please?

205
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:02,693
还不行 纽约人
Not yet, New York.

206
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:03,994
Elvis 这家餐馆
Elvis, this restaurant

207
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:06,329
是一个黑客入侵
was the source of a hack attempt

208
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:08,264
联邦服务器场的源头
on a Federal server farm.

209
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:11,834
今天早上 4个人在那儿被害
A facility where four people were killed this morning.

210
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:13,969
好吧 那么你认为
Right. So you think it's, uh,

211
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,872
我在这里很可疑
suspicious that I'm here,

212
00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:18,374
考虑到我过去一些
considering my past miscommunications

213
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:20,242
与法律相抵触的行为
with the law.

214
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:21,677
嗯 与法律相抵触 你是说
Um, by miscommunications, do you mean

215
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,280
多项重罪判决吗 没错
multiple felony convictions? Then, yes.

216
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,715
我不是你要找的罪犯
I'm not the felon you're looking for.

217
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:28,417
罪犯叫Ethan Beck
His name is Ethan Beck.

218
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:31,386
你是怎么知道的
How do you know that?

219
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:32,921
因为我也在找他
'Cause I'm looking for him, too.

220
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:35,424
他管理着一个被称为"集结者"的黑客行动主义小组
He runs a hacktivist group called the "Collective".

221
00:09:35,426 --> 00:09:37,091
更像是恐怖组织
More like a terrorist organization,

222
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:39,160
曝光个人丑闻
exposing people's dirty secrets.

223
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,829
不 创立集结者是为了增加透明度
No. The Collective was founded to create transparency

224
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,431
和曝光腐败
and expose corruption.

225
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,799
那么 现在它在曝光
Well, right now, it's exposing

226
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,468
名人的私生活
prominent folks' personal lives.

227
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,303
是啊 这让我非常恼火
Yeah, and that's really pissing me off.

228
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:50,203
你为什么会在意
Why do you care?

229
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,773
因为我的名声要被败坏了
Because my reputation's at stake.

230
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,409
因为他是集结者的创始人
Because he created the Collective.

231
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,845
没错 我和Ethan一起建立的
Yeah. I created it with Ethan.

232
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,378
他是我的门生
He was my protégé.

233
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,714
但他很自负
But he let his ego get the best of him,

234
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:03,316
这个组织也偏离了原来的目的
and it's not about the cause anymore.

235
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:06,319
变成了Ethan证明自身强大的工具
It's about Ethan proving how powerful he is.

236
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:10,323
因此你们一定要让我帮忙找到他
And that's why you guys have to let me help you find him.

237
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:12,892
谈到自负 我们能处理这事 对吧
Talk about ego. We can handle this, all right?

238
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:15,761
Dwayne 你不知道你在和谁打交道
Dwayne, you don't have any idea who you're dealing with.

239
00:10:15,763 --> 00:10:18,597
对吧 他很难追踪 听着
Do you? He's hard to track. Listen.

240
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,298
他搞垮了世界500强企业
He's taken down Fortune 500 companies.

241
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,534
他让政府部门束手无策
He's brought government agencies to their knees.

242
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:24,302
而且他从来没被抓到过
And he's never been caught.

243
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:26,037
他很危险
He's dangerous.

244
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,906
Elvis Ethan Beck杀了4个人
Elvis, Ethan Beck murdered four people,

245
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:31,209
包括一个海军上尉 我们知道他很危险
including a Navy Lieutenant. We know he's dangerous.

246
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:32,677
说得好
Good point.

247
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,612
但你得让我帮你们找到他
But you got to let me help you find him.

248
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,747
他所有的伎俩都是我教的
I taught him every trick he knows.

249
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:37,982
我是唯一
I am the one guy

250
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:39,917
能追踪到他的人
who could track this dude down.

251
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,854
求你了
Please.

252
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:46,491
-Gregorio -在

把Elvis带回NCIS

备齐所有他需要的东西
Set up him up with whatever he needs.

255
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:51,895
当真么
For real?

256
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:53,329
别那么沮丧
Don't look so upset.

257
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:55,131
我不咬人
I don't bite.

258
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,567
除非你恳请我这么做
Unless you ask real nice.

259
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,235
你去哪里
Where are you going?

260
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:01,705
市长召唤我

无数条私人信息
Hundreds of private messages.

266
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:17,052
你只是其中的一个
You're not the only one.

267
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:18,988
少来 记者一直追问
Come on, the reporters asking Que--

268
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,422
他们无处不在 你也瞧见了 对吧
They're all over the place. You've seen them, right?

269
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:21,657
和你的新闻秘书举止亲密
...intimately involved with your press secretary.

270
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:22,992
呃 我没有什么好说的

271

没有人来
I've got nobody, though,

272
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:24,993
替我挡下这些问题
to field questions for me,

273
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:26,160
因为我的新闻秘书的丈夫
because my press secretary's

274
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:27,361
让她辞职了
husband made her resign.

275
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:29,564
我有大量凶杀案要解决
I've got multiple homicides to solve,

276
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,132
能说重点吗
can we cut to the chase?

277
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:33,768
你倒是很开心啊 不是吗
You're enjoying this, ain't ya?

278
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,269
我看得出来
I can see.

279
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:36,938
幸灾乐祸 有那么一点儿
You're enjoying this, just a little bit.

280
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,873
市长先生 你的重点是
Your point, Mr. Mayor?

281
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:42,943
我知道你认为我是个坏人
Now, I know you think that I'm a bad guy.

282
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:45,278
对吧 呃
Right? That, uh...

283
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,313
我只在乎自己
I'm only interested in myself.

284
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,650
如果按过往来说的话
If history is any guide.

285
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:53,954
我搞砸了 Dwayne 我完了
I'm screwed, Dwayne. Oh, yeah. I'm done.

286
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:56,590
这件事我无能为力
And there's nothing I can do about that now,

287
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,158
但是无辜的人正受到伤害
but innocent people are getting hurt.

288
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,826
人们的私生活被曝光
Private lives are getting exposed.

289
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:03,663
对很多好人来说会很糟
And this could be very bad for a lot of good people.

290
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,666
我们都认同这点 对吧
We agree on that much, don't we?

291
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,569
我对你有用
I can be useful to you.

292
00:12:09,571 --> 00:12:11,804
我可以幕后操控
I can pull strings.

293
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:14,906
若你需要 我可以为你提供资源
I could give you access to resources if you need them.

294
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:19,544
无论你要什么 尽管说
Whatever you need. Just say the word.

295
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,014
我们一起来解决
Let's fix this together.

296
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:26,918
也许有些事你能做
Might be something you can do.

297
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:33,657
呃 你
Uh... you...

298
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,125
你是
you're, uh...

299
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:36,894
我是说
I mean...

300
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,428
你中风了吗
Are you having a stroke, kid?

301
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,598
说真的 要我给你做人工呼吸吗
Seriously, do I have to give you mouth to mouth?

302
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,999
我是Elvis
I'm Elvis.

303
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,533
哦 是的 我知道你是谁
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know exactly who you are.

304
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:45,335
你是人民英雄
You're-you're a personal hero.

305
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:46,704
希望这听起来不奇怪
I hope that doesn't sound strange.

306
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:48,805
没有 一点也不奇怪
No, no, that's not creepy at all.

307
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:50,372
只是 你的事迹是我
It's just, your work is pretty much the reason

308
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:52,441
最初接触电脑的主要原因
I got into computers in the first place.

309
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:55,244
好吧 现在我感觉自己老了 但也有点荣幸
Okay, now I feel old, but also a bit flattered.

310
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:56,412
谢谢
Thank you.

311
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:57,647
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

312
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:00,216
我在试着追踪Ethan Beck
I'm trying to track down Ethan Beck.

313
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:01,951
抱歉 我不知道这是你的办公室
Sorry, I didn't know this is your office,

314
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:03,352
因为你这儿有黑客设备
but you got a killer setup here.

315
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:05,121
是的 黑客入侵用的设备 但不是我的
Oh, yeah, it is killer, but it's not mine.

316
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:06,521
我本身没有办公室
I don't really have an office, per Se.

317
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:07,723
-我是新人 -好吧
- I-I'm kind of new. - Okay.

318
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:09,290
事实上 我刚来
Actually, I'm very new.

319
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:11,093
虽然我以前经常来
Although, I've also been around a lot,

320
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,628
所以 这很复杂
so, it's all very complicated.

321
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,597
总之 我也要找Ethan Beck
Anyway, I'm-I'm supposed to find Ethan Beck, too.

322
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:16,965
好吧 坐下吧
Okay, good. Cop a squat.

323
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,000
让我们找到他
Let's get at it.

324
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:19,868
好的
All right.

325
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,037
额 用那个吧
Um, uh, over there's good.

326
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,570
-好的 -是 是
- That's probably good. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

327
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:30,077
Ethan很难追踪 你知道吧
Now, Ethan is a hard guy to track down, you know?

328
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,016
没那么容易能追踪到 但是 我们有办法
Not easy to trace, but, uh, we got a work-around here.

329
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:37,918
我们能看到整个城市的网络通信量
We got all the Internet traffic for the entire city.

330
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,816
哇哦 你是怎么...
Whoa, how did you...?

331
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,775
不是我 是你们市长
Not me, your mayor.

332
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,489
他和雇员睡觉抽空来给我们帮忙
He took a break from bedding his employees to help us out.

333
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,191
多亏了你老板
Thanks to your boss.

334
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:48,594
所以 如果Ethan要筛选这些偷来的文件
So... so, if Ethan's sifting through all these stolen files,

335
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,897
并把它们放到网上 那么他会需要
and he's posting them online, then he's gonna need

336
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,866
占用大量带宽 对吗
a high concentration of bandwidth, right?

337
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:54,400
是的 而且Ethan不会做这苦差事的
Right, and Ethan doesn't do the grunt work,

338
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:57,002
所以会有个喽啰替他做
so one of his minions does it for him.

339
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,771
所以 如果我们找到这低段位的菜鸟
So, if we trace the low-hanging fruit...

340
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:00,005
顺藤摸瓜就能钓到大鱼
We can trade up to the big dog.

341
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:00,600
对的
That's right.

342
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,876
太好了 真有趣
All right. Yeah! This is fun.

343
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:04,342
是的 是的 继续干活
Yeah, yeah, eyes front. Yeah.

344
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,844
好的
Okay.

345
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,279
在法国区的咖啡馆
I've got some heavy traffic

346
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,981
发现了大流量的传输
coming from a coffee shop in The Quarter.

347
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:11,216
干得好 孩子 召唤骑兵吧
Good job, kid. Call in the cavalry.

348
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,185
事实上 我就是骑兵
Actually, I am the cavalry.

349
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,352
等等 我需要你 帮我找到其它集结者
Actually, I need you to help me find the other Collectives.

350
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,339
好啊 好啊
Oh, okay, yeah.

351
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:17,790
- 开工吧 -好 来吧
- Let's do it. - Yeah. Right.

352
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,791
-在那儿 我是说 -回到这里 当然
- By here, I mean of course... - Back over there. Sure.

353
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:20,792
我这就给Lasalle打电话
I'm gonna call Lasalle.

354
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,160
肯定在电话那头等着呢
Pretty much always over there.

355
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,528
真是太好了
Oh, this is great.

356
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,499
就像蝙蝠侠和罗宾 只是罗宾更牛逼些
Like Batman and Robin, except a cooler Robin.

357
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,634
咖啡店在那个转角
Coffee shop's up here on the corner.

358
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:33,070
现在确认了
It's official.

359
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,839
市长Hamilton的不雅视频已经传开了
Mayor Hamilton's sex tape just went wide.

360
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,407
他们抓到他和新闻秘书有一腿
They got him with his press secretary.

361
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,942
不 是其他人 朋友的老婆
No. Someone else. A friend's wife.

362
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,244
- 我真替他们难过啊 -替Hamilton吗
- I feel bad. - For Hamilton?

363
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:43,947
他和那个女人 任何隐私被侵犯的人
For him, the woman, anybody who has their privacy invaded.

364
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,758
我是说 我们都有隐私 不是吗
I mean, we all have secrets, no?

365
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,760
不是每个人
Not everyone.

366
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,584
同意
Agreed.

367
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,185
好吧 你们真是一对圣人
Okay, you got a couple of saints here.

368
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,386
如果你生活正派 就没什么可隐藏
Well, you live a decent life, you got nothing to hide.

369
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:56,692
看看那个机器人先生
Check out Mr. Robot.

370
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:58,060
对 莫霍克人 人体穿环
Yeah, Mohawk, piercings,

371
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,161
可能是我们要找的人
could be our guy.

372
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:03,899
打扰一下
Excuse me.

373
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:05,499
联邦探员
Federal agents.

374
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:06,601
需要问你几个问题
Need to ask you a few questions.

375
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:08,536
兔子要跑了
We got a rabbit.

376
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:19,948
-抓到你了 -放开我
- Easy now. - Get off me.

377
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:25,252
亚提卡 亚提卡
【注：在1971年亚提卡监狱暴动事件中，
政府不当的处理方式（射杀42人）
引发了美国社会一次巨大的风波】
Attica! Attica!

378
00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:27,354
还是让女士们搞定吧
I'm gonna let you ladies handle this one.

379
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:34,294
谢谢你 Roy
Thank you, Roy.

380
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,096
你有麻烦了 Aviva
You're in a lot of trouble, Aviva.

381
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:37,631
袭击联邦探员
Assaulting a Federal agent.

382
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,799
是你们先对我动粗的
Your guy manhandled me.

383
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:42,368
你还有个大的麻烦
You got bigger problems.

384
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,438
我们知道你与
We know that you're connected

385
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,275
联邦机构的主要安全漏洞有牵扯
to a major security breach at a Federal facility.

386
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:51,844
你公开了很多敏感数据
That you've released sensitive data to the public.

387
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:53,379
你是集结者的一员
You're a member of the Collective,

388
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:55,547
而且你为Ethan Beck工作
and you work for Ethan Beck.

389
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:57,548
证据
Prove it.

390
00:15:58,385 --> 00:15:59,885
我们想要知道的一切
Everything we need to know

391
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:01,619
就在你的电脑里
is right here in your computer.

392
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:03,688
启动它啊
Boot it up.

393
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,356
试试进入硬盘
Try and access the hard drive.

394
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:06,724
看看会发生什么
See what happens.

395
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,459
陷阱 是吗
Booby trapped, huh?

396
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:09,895
哈
Wow.

397
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:11,329
真聪明
Smart.

398
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:13,197
聪明到
At a level you can't even

399
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,665
你根本来不及思考
begin to contemplate.

400
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,434
集结者不惧法律
The Collective isn't afraid of laws

401
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:21,305
或后果 或警察
or consequences or cops.

402
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:23,207
可以了
That's fair enough.

403
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:28,913
但现在 我不是你要担心的人
But... I'm not the one you need to worry about right now.

404
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:38,788
你知道我是谁吗
Do you know who I am?

405
00:16:39,657 --> 00:16:41,624
我是Elvis Bertrand
I'm Elvis Bertrand.

406
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,126
不可能
No way.

407
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,829
你的噩梦现在变成了现实
And your worst nightmare is coming true in real time,

408
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:48,596
因为我不在乎法律或是规矩
because I don't care about laws or rules

409
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:50,999
或是你硬盘里可悲的陷阱
or pathetic booby traps on your hard drive.

410
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,935
你要配合我们工作
You are gonna cooperate with us,

411
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:55,237
不然我就将你所做的一切
or I'm gonna expose every move you've made

412
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,604
都作为所谓的黑客行动主义者
as a so-called hacktivist

413
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:58,606
公之于众
to the whole world.

414
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:06,447
你们想要什么
What do you want?

415
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:09,516
想要你联系Ethan Beck
Want you to contact Ethan Beck.

416
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:15,656
只需要联系到他 剩下的我们来处理
Just reach out to him, and I will do the rest.

417
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,800
好了
Okay.

418
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:29,369
我希望你知道你在做什么
I hope you know what you're doing,

419
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:31,537
因为他不喜欢被人找到
'cause he doesn't like to be found.

420
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,340
现在 我只是在运行一个
Now, I'm just running

421
00:17:33,342 --> 00:17:36,776
我设计的 小小的优雅的回溯程序
a little, elegant, backtrace program I devised,

422
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:41,046
它会在他发现之前攻击他的电脑
and it will attack his computer before he knows what hit him.

423
00:17:42,884 --> 00:17:44,984
喔
Ooh.

424
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,519
不太妙啊
That's not good.

425
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:50,022
Elvis
Elvis.

426
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:54,293
知道怎么回事吗
Any idea what's going on?

427
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:55,260
不是我干的 我发誓
I did not do it. I swear.

428
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:57,262
不是你做的 是Ethan
You didn't do this. Ethan did.

429
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,769
我听说你在找我
I heard you were looking for me.

430
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:08,306
你能追踪到他的地址吗
Can you trace his location?

431
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:09,874
我试试 但是他已经控制了我们整个网络
I'll try, but he's got control of our whole network.

432
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:11,309
你已经捅了马蜂窝
You've uncovered the hornet's nest

433
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:13,343
吵醒了一个沉睡的巨人
and woken a sleeping giant.

434
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:15,012
好吧 我不管你这极其夸张的
Okay, I'm gonna ignore your agregious overuse

435
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:16,579
混合隐喻 Ethan
of mixed metaphors, Ethan,

436
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:19,283
想问你 "你到底哪根筋不对了 伙计"
and ask you, "What the hell is your problem, buddy?!"

437
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:22,319
Elvis 你背叛了我们的事业
Elvis, you're a traitor to the cause.

438
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:23,787
我拒绝和你谈话
I refuse to speak to you.

439
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:27,357
你杀害了四个人的正当理由是什么
What cause justifies the murder of four people?

440
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,358
我不想听你瞎说
I won't listen to your lies.

441
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,860
你完全不知道你在说些什么
You have no idea what you're talking about

442
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,629
或你正在和谁说话
or who you're messing with.

443
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,766
-Sebastian -他是怎么办到的
- Sebastian! - How is he doing that?

444
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:39,402
我不知道 但真的很酷炫
I don't know, but it's kind of cool.

445
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,606
好吧 Ethan Ethan 听我说 伙计
Okay, Ethan, Ethan, listen to me, buddy.

446
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,107
你不是这样的人
This isn't you.

447
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:47,675
我要你过来
I need you to come in here.

448
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:49,344
别再找我
Stop looking for me.

449
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,346
抱歉 我们办不到
Sorry, we can't oblige you of that.

450
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:53,648
那你们就为此付出代价吧
Then you'll all pay for it.

451
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:05,692
好吧 呃
Okay, well...

452
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:07,627
不该这么糟糕
that could've gone better.

453
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:26,304
这个绿野仙踪似的举动
This whole Wizard of Oz act doesn't exactly mesh

454
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:28,940
和杀掉四个人的冷血杀手不太吻合
with a suspect willing to kill four people in cold blood.

455
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,376
这些疑问等我们找到他再说
Well, contradiction we can try to explain after we find him.

456
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,012
拜托 告诉我 你还有其它追踪Ethan Beck的方法吗
Please, tell me you have another way of tracing Ethan Beck?

457
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:36,179
没什么办法
Not off the top of my head.

458
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:37,915
他潜伏得很深
He's gone deep underground,

459
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:39,650
或许把电源插头都拔了
probably unplugging completely.

460
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:41,485
所以我们不能用数码追踪他
So we don't trace him digitally.

461
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:43,253
反正我们没办法在线上打败他
Never gonna outsmart him online, anyway.

462
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:45,088
哦 这么说好伤我心啊
Ooh, that hurts my feelings.

463
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,324
应该关注他在现实生活中的样子
Focus on who he is in the real world instead.

464
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:49,926
你是在说生活模式吗
You're talking about pattern of life?

465
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:52,261
额 这个"生活模式"是什么
Um, what is this "pattern of life"?

466
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:53,730
人物描绘技术
Profiling technique.

467
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:55,965
我们会收集关于疑犯的所有信息
We gather every detail we know about a suspect.

468
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,199
他吃什么 穿什么
What he eats, what he wears,

469
00:19:57,201 --> 00:19:58,568
喜欢什么类型的音乐
kind of music he likes.

470
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,602
尤其是不寻常的事情
Especially irregularities.

471
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:00,870
任何不平常的特征或习惯
Any unusual traits or habits.

472
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:02,405
好吧 从何开始
Okay, where to start?

473
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:04,407
这个人只是在家里
Well, you got a guy that sits

474
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:06,842
坐在电脑屏幕前
alone at home in front of a computer screen.

475
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:08,877
怪人有自己的活动区域
Weirdness comes with the territory.

476
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:10,846
我们会把所有信息输入到分析程序里
We put it all into an analytical program,

477
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,648
然后会得到可以找到他的重要线索
and then we got a good shot at finding him.

478
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,182
你们真的认为这样有用吗
And you actually think that'll work?

479
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:17,519
不久前我们就是这么查到你的
We tracked your sorry ass not too long ago.

480
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:20,923
你要知道 如果当时你朝我开了枪 我们可能会成为朋友
You know, I think if you gave me a shot, we could become pals.

481
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:22,691
-真的吗 -是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

482
00:20:22,693 --> 00:20:24,659
以后再看有没有这可能
We're about to find out.

483
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,393
Elvis 和Gregorio谈谈
Elvis, sit with Gregorio.

484
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:30,130
关于Ethan的一切都告诉她
Tell her everything she needs to know about Ethan.

485
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,399
好了 来电了
Okay. Got the power going.

486
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,134
网络正在启动备份
The Internet's booting back up,

487
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:35,436
所以总而言之 可以正常运转了
so all in all, we're in business.

488
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:37,104
干得好 Sebastian
Good work, Sebastian.

489
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:38,339
Loretta有发现 所以 Sebastian
Loretta's got something, so, Sebastian,

490
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:39,774
你跟我一起 出发
you're with me. Let's go.

491
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:42,342
抱歉 失陪了
Sorry, excuse me.

492
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:43,910
说实话 我有点怕你
I'm gonna be honest. I'm a little afraid of you.

493
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:45,178
只是有一点么
Just a little?

494
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,146
你得学习一下怎么接受别人的称赞
You got to learn to take a compliment.

495
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:50,917
等等 这些邮件是什么
Wait, what are all these e-mails?

496
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:51,952
出故障还是怎么了
Some kind of glitch or something?

497
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:53,152
那些不是你的邮件
Those aren't your e-mails.

498
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:55,021
Ethan动作挺快啊
That Ethan sure works fast.

499
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:56,089
做什么的动作挺快
Works fast at what?

500
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:59,625
在制造混乱方面
At-at creating chaos.

501
00:21:00,495 --> 00:21:02,260
呦 有网络了
Yo, the Internet's back up.

502
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,562
我知道
I know.

503
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,831
我刚收到一大堆邮件
I just got a crazy amount of e-mails.

504
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,100
是啊 我也一样 似乎不太好
Yeah, me, too, and it's not good.

505
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:10,970
是你做卧底期间的ATF档案
These are ATF files from your undercover days.

506
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:13,906
哇哦 你开玩笑吗 怎么回事啊
Whoa. Are you kidding me? How'd that happen?

507
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,740
我猜是Ethan Beck
Well, I'm assuming it's Ethan Beck

508
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:18,075
在兑现他的承诺
making good on his threat.

509
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,978
好吧 你得删了这些东西
Well, you need to get rid of those.

510
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,579
对啊 我这里全都是
Yeah, I'm all over it.

511
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:22,881
嗨 你最好也清理一下
Hey, and you might want to do the same

512
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:24,181
你的收件箱
with whatever's in your inbox.

513
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,017
没错
Yeah.

514
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:29,717
虽然我不是很想说
但是我非常不确定Percy合适加入团队 King
我们再谈谈吧

515
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,626
是啊 我应该清理一下
Yeah, I probably should have.

516
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:36,994
哦 天呐
Oh, boy.

517
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:37,995
你发现什么了
What'd you get?

518
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,396
只是一封你发给Pride的邮件
Just an e-mail from you to Pride

519
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,932
里面说你认为我不该加入团队
saying that you don't think I should be added to the team.

520
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,001
你的卧底身份刚刚暴露
Your undercover identity was just exposed

521
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,468
而你就因为一个断章取义的邮件
and you're pissed about an e-mail

522
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,737
对我发火吗
taken completely out of context?

523
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,138
哦 拜托 告诉我怎么回事
Oh, by all means, give me the context.

524
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,573
这个嘛 我当时并不了解你 也不知道
Well, I didn't know you yet, and couldn't tell

525
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,408
你会怎样适应团队的机动性
how you would mix with the team dynamic.

526
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,844
我为团队挨过子弹 这表现怎样
I took a bullet for the team. How's that for dynamic?

527
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,379
我知道 你从那以后上百次的证明了自己
And you proved yourself a hundred times since, to me.

528
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:59,882
我也向你证明了我自己 对吗
And me to you, right?

529
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:01,483
我们也许应该在其他人受到伤害前
We should probably stop reading these

530
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:03,152
停止阅读这些邮件了
before someone else gets hurt.

531
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:15,296
既然Sebastian忙着发动网络战争
Well, since Sebastian's busy waging cyber-warfare,

532
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:17,231
我另找了一位技术员来分析
I had another tech analyze the bullets

533
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,100
Shaw上尉谋杀案的子弹
from Lieutenant Shaw's murder.

534
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:20,635
那些弹片都碎掉了
Well, those slugs were in fragments.

535
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:22,403
你还进行弹道匹配么
You were able to get a ballistics match?

536
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:24,738
没有 是更有趣的方法
No, something far more intriguing:

537
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,441
墨水的痕迹
traces of ink.

538
00:22:27,443 --> 00:22:28,976
墨水 什么样的墨水
Ink? What kind of ink?

539
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:30,177
打印机 钢笔 我是说 大概有
Printer, pen? I mean, there's

540
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,679
几百种分类吧
literally hundreds of classifications.

541
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:34,014
我不知道 Sebastian 因为样本太小
I don't know, Sebastian, but the sample was so small,

542
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:35,916
除你之外 我不想让任何人接触
I wouldn't want anyone to touch it, except you.

543
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:37,250
说得好
That's a good call.

544
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:39,519
玩毛细电泳法可不能太脆弱
Capillary electrophoresis is not for the faint of heart.

545
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:44,190
Ethan Beck正在证明他既危险又难以捉摸
This Ethan Beck is proving to be as elusive as he is dangerous.

546
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:46,092
他让我们大吃一惊
He threw us all for a loop.

547
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:48,828
我可从未见Elvis怕过谁
And I've never seen Elvis afraid of anyone.

548
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,731
担心Beck会回来 开枪杀人
Worried Beck will come back, guns blazing.

549
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,499
我怕的不只是枪
It's not just guns I'm afraid of here.

550
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:54,934
丑闻吗
A scandal then?

551
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:56,168
比如Hamilton市长的丑闻
Like with Mayor Hamilton?

552
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:58,168
{\an6}To：NCIS总部--主任
个人意见关于Sebastian探员申请的回复
尽管他智商过人、勇于担当以及态度积极。
但我仍然担心Lund在这一领域的能力。
在他成为探员这方面仍然需要更多的观察。

553
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,536
这个 不只是他
Well, not just him.

554
00:22:58,538 --> 00:22:59,771
现在新奥尔良的人都因为Ethan Beck
A lot of New Orleanians are reeling today

555
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:01,206
而头疼
because of Ethan Beck.

556
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,475
我要去 呃 我的实验室处理这个
I'm gonna go, uh, process this in my lab.

557
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:05,276
不用等我 这样你不用担心我
No need to wait, which should come as a relief to you,

558
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:06,511
在外勤方面没有经验
since you won't have to worry about

559
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:08,580
这对你应该是个解脱
my inability in the field for a while.

560
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:12,951
好吧 那是什么意思
Okay, what was that about?

561
00:23:12,953 --> 00:23:14,284
不知道
Not a clue.

562
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,058
屋漏偏逢连阴雨
Rains, it pours.

563
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:25,395
Hamilton市长再次陷入水深火热之中
Mayor Hamilton is once again in hot water.

564
00:23:25,397 --> 00:23:27,031
一段市长和一位未知女性的
A sex tape featuring the mayor

565
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:29,900
性爱录像被放到了网上
and an unidentified woman has been released online...

566
00:23:29,902 --> 00:23:31,968
他们拿到了录像 Dwayne
They got videos, Dwayne.

567
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,403
我
Of me

568
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:37,107
跟不同的女人
with different women.

569
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:38,407
都是雇员吗
More staffers?

570
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:41,678
目前这不是重点 对吧
Well, that's not the point now, is it?

571
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,647
录像从哪儿来的
Why the hell is there video?

572
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:44,814
不知道
Couldn't say.

573
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:46,816
不知道还是不想说
Couldn't or won't?

574
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:50,218
我的邮件在联邦执法机构的数据库里
My e-mails are on a Federal law enforcement database.

575
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,820
好吧
Okay.

576
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,522
当今年代 这种事情时有发生
This day and age, that happens.

577
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:54,657
我们接受
We live with it.

578
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,126
但是录像
But the video--

579
00:23:57,128 --> 00:23:58,994
那就意味着我
well, that means that I'm...

580
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:01,329
实际上是在被调查 对吗
actively under investigation, right?

581
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:05,099
我没调查你 如果你想问这个
I'm not investigating you, if that's your question.

582
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:08,335
没 至少目前没有
Not... currently, at least.

583
00:24:08,337 --> 00:24:11,272
你对我做出过不少指控
Well, you've thrown a lot of accusations my way.

584
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:15,509
你知道 最近一次 Javier Garcia案件
You know, the Javier Garcia case, most recently.

585
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:19,213
Garcia被谋杀了 你知道的
Garcia was murdered. You know that.

586
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:21,482
但是
But,

587
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:23,684
如果有些事情
if there's something specific

588
00:24:23,686 --> 00:24:25,385
你想坦白 我听着呢
you want to confess, I'm all ears.

589
00:24:27,022 --> 00:24:28,689
好了 Dwayne
Well, Dwayne,

590
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:33,093
如果说这一天证明了什么
if this day has proven anything,

591
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:36,462
那就是每个人都有秘密 即便是你
it's that everybody has a secret, even you.

592
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:40,632
如果有人有目标地深入调查
And if someone were motivated to look hard enough,

593
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:42,634
谁知道他们会发现什么
who knows what they would find?

594
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:49,975
好吧
Here we go.

595
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,020
听着 你看到就是看到了
<i>Look,</i> <i>you've seen what you've seen.</i>

596
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:57,870
你又不能收回
You can't take it back.

597
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,037
这就是你的回答吗
That's your response?

598
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,807
你告诉Isler我们是毒贩派来的一对卧底
You told Isler we were a pair of cartel imbeds.

599
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:03,108
我说的是有可能
I said it was possible!

600
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,010
你还说我们睡在一起 恶心
And that we were sleeping together? Ew!

601
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:07,612
我说的只是感觉 诚实地讲
Look, you got a vibe, that's all I'm saying. Honestly?

602
00:25:07,614 --> 00:25:09,881
很明显 你们没看看你们自己么
It's kind of obvious. Have you watched yourselves?

603
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,982
没 但是你看过
No, but you have.

604
00:25:10,984 --> 00:25:13,050
监控我们好几个周 还拍照
Been surveilling us for weeks, taking photos.

605
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:14,484
这正是FBI把我送来的原因
That's why the FBI brought me here,

606
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:15,820
来调查你们 你们知道的
to investigate you. You know that!

607
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,121
是啊 可那是我们的私人生活
Yeah, but that's our personal lives.

608
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:19,223
你能确定哪些监控是必要的吗
Do you know what surveillance entails?

609
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:20,725
而且反正 我证明了你们的清白 所以
And I cleared you both anyways, so...

610
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,226
哦 我感觉好多了
Oh, I feel so much better.

611
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,461
很好 那现在我们可以谈谈我发现了什么
Good! 'Cause now we can talk about what I got.

612
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:25,262
你觉得我们...
What about what we...?

613
00:25:25,264 --> 00:25:26,864
够了
Enough!

614
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:28,699
你们知道
You understand

615
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,399
这正是Ethan Beck想要的结果
this is exactly what Ethan Beck wants.

616
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:32,068
让我们退出游戏 迷惑自己
Throw us off our game, confuse us.

617
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,370
这样他就逃掉了 你们要让这事发生吗
So he can get away. You gonna let that happen?

618
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:35,705
那叫幸灾乐祸
It's called Shadenfreude.

619
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:37,140
当然
I'll say.

620
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:38,574
那是我几年前设计用来追踪
It's an algorithm I created years ago

621
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:39,943
多嘴的CEO们的算法
to go after mouthy CEOs.

622
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:42,411
它挑选邮件
It culls e-mails,

623
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:44,480
寻找与同事有关的敏感信息
looking for sensitive information about coworkers.

624
00:25:44,482 --> 00:25:46,815
我设计它是用来揭露腐败
And I created it to expose corruption.

625
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:48,516
但是Ethan用它来对付你们
But Ethan has used it on you guys.

626
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:50,619
确定他的位置 有进展吗
Any progress locating him?

627
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:52,654
我们汇总了能找到的
We aggregated every detail we can find

628
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:55,490
关于Ethan Beck私人习惯和癖好的所有细节
on Ethan Beck's personal habits and idiosyncrasies.

629
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:57,492
信息很多 他恐高
There's a lot. He's afraid of heights,

630
00:25:57,494 --> 00:25:58,861
所以他不会住在高层
so he's not living in a high-rise.

631
00:25:58,863 --> 00:26:00,829
他还是个处于恢复期的瘾君子
He's also a recovering heroin addict,

632
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:02,430
我相信他没法跑太远
a big believer in the twelve steps.

633
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:03,765
好的 那他得离交易场所近一些
Okay, so he needs to be near meetings.

634
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:05,332
然后再加上
And then you add to that,

635
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:06,868
他是一个领地偏执狂
the paranoia that goes with the territory,

636
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,702
以强势人物为目标
going after the very powerful.

637
00:26:08,704 --> 00:26:09,904
他富于机动性
He likes mobility,

638
00:26:09,906 --> 00:26:11,906
一定在一个能立即逃跑的地方
has to be able to escape at a moment's notice.

639
00:26:11,908 --> 00:26:13,207
好的 在这里
Okay, well around here,

640
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:15,076
水路是最快的逃跑方式 所以 是在一条船上
water's the fastest way out, so, a boat.

641
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:18,045
好了 我们怎样进一步缩小范围呢
Okay, how do we narrow it further?

642
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:21,614
披萨
Pizza.

643
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:24,217
Ethan痴迷于木烤箱披萨
Ethan is obsessed with wood oven pizza.

644
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:27,854
他一定要保证能随时订餐
And he has to have it delivered at all hours.

645
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:29,856
我们找到了
We got a hit.

646
00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:30,857
贝壳海滩码头
Shell Beach Marina.

647
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:31,958
Gregorio 跟我一起
Gregorio, with me.

648
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,593
开始行动
Let's move.

649
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:43,535
高速互联网卫星
High-speed Internet satellite.

650
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:46,505
就是这里
This is the place.

651
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:59,517
NCIS 把手放在我能看见的地方 马上
NCIS, hands where I can see 'em, right now.

652
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,427
注射器
Syringe.

653
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,274
Pride 你得看看这个
Pride, you need to see this!

654
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,045
遗书
Suicide note.

655
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:31,380
这个家伙正忙于
This guy's in the middle of a crusade,

656
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:32,949
揭发他人
exposing people left and right

657
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,183
然后突然了结了自己
and just offs himself?

658
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,784
你看这事正常吗
Does that seem right to you?

659
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:40,056
这里的一切似乎都不正常
Nothing about this seems right.

660
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:02,451
Ethan Beck的血管里
Ethan Beck had a hundred milligrams

661
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:04,885
有一百毫克的高纯度海洛因
of nearly pure heroin in his bloodstream.

662
00:28:04,887 --> 00:28:07,489
没人能给自己注射那么多
No one would have been able to inject that much.

663
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:10,358
在完成注射前他就会晕倒
He would have passed out before completing the dose.

664
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,859
这个人是被谋杀的
This man was murdered.

665
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:14,429
然而有人希望我们认为他是自杀
Yet someone wants us to think he committed suicide.

666
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,664
你觉得他有同伙吗
You think he had an accomplice?

667
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:19,133
Beck也许可以在网上发布
Beck may have released confidential files

668
00:28:19,135 --> 00:28:20,734
机密文件和录像
and videos on the Internet,

669
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:22,202
黑进我们的电子邮箱
thrown my team into disarray

670
00:28:22,204 --> 00:28:23,437
让我的团队陷入混乱
by hacking our e-mails,

671
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:26,140
但是攻破一个联邦机构
but breaching a federal facility?

672
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:28,074
还熟练地杀掉我们四个人
And expertly killing four people?

673
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:31,512
没错 Beck先生身体不是很健康
Yeah, Mr. Beck was not in the pink of health.

674
00:28:31,514 --> 00:28:34,080
他起身开门都会气喘吁吁
He would have gotten winded answering the front door,

675
00:28:34,082 --> 00:28:35,581
更别说闯入大门
let alone storming the gates.

676
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,049
那么 到底怎么回事
Well then, what?

677
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:40,486
有人把Ethan的DNA留在犯罪现场
Someone planted Ethan's DNA at our crime scene?

678
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:42,388
栽赃他让他做替罪羊吗
Set him up to take the fall?

679
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,856
为什么搞得这么麻烦
Why go to all that trouble?

680
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:47,126
Elvis和队里其他人
Elvis and the rest of the team

681
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:49,395
正在搜索Ethan的电脑
are searching through Ethan's computer right now

682
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:51,130
看能不能找到答案
for the answer,

683
00:28:51,132 --> 00:28:54,132
可能他们又互相吵了起来
provided they aren't at each other's throats again.

684
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:56,234
嗯 团队成员还有矛盾吗
Mm. Still dissention in the ranks?

685
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,002
说实话 我很吃惊 只要这么一件小事
Honestly, I'm surprised how little it took

686
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,437
就能把我们踢出局
to throw us off our game.

687
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,872
没人被踢出局 Dwayne
No one's off their game, Dwayne.

688
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:02,840
我们是家人 家人之间争吵很正常
We're family, families bicker.

689
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:08,012
哦 Pride 没想到你在这里
Oh, Pride, I didn't realize you were here.

690
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:10,047
我正要打电话告诉你一些信息
I was about to call you with some information.

691
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,748
好啊 我在这呢
Well, here I am.

692
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,517
你发现什么了
What do you got?

693
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,320
我分析了从Shaw上尉体内子弹上
Well, I analyzed the ink found on the bullet

694
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:17,821
发现的墨水
from Lieutenant Shaw's body.

695
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,423
结果发现
Turns out,

696
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,757
那是用来纹身的
it's tattoo ink.

697
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,893
是一种被称作"Chimera"的特殊专利配方
Special proprietary blend called "Chimera"

698
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:24,628
限量供应 而且
Sold in limited supply and only used

699
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,429
这一地区只有一家店在使用
by one shop in the area.

700
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,331
我猜你会带一个更有经验的探员
Guessing you're gonna take one of your more experienced agents

701
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,932
跟你一起去查个明白
to go check it out.

702
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,603
我猜
And I'm guessing

703
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,371
你现在的行为
your behavior right now

704
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,842
跟我在邮件里说过的什么话有关
is about something I said in an e-mail.

705
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,611
说出来吧
Out with it!

706
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,814
你跟NCIS主任说我经验不足
You told the director of NCIS that I was inexperienced

707
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:48,049
而且你对我的外勤能力缺乏信心
and that you're unsure of my ability in the field.

708
00:29:48,051 --> 00:29:50,686
是的 因为你确实经验不足
That's right. Because you are inexperienced,

709
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,154
Sebastian 而且你还没出勤几次
Sebastian. And you haven't been out in the field that much,

710
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:55,190
但你知道我还说了什么吗
but you know what else I said?

711
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:57,859
我愿意打赌 如果给你一个机会
I'd be willing to bet you'd make a fantastic agent

712
00:29:57,861 --> 00:30:00,294
-你会成为一个出色的探员 -哦
- if given a chance. - Oh.

713
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:03,130
这个 我 我猜他们没把完整的邮件发给我
Well, I-I guess they didn't send the whole e-mail then.

714
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:04,198
没错
Exactly.

715
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,133
现在你知道了
So, now you know.

716
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,135
我们可否去纹身店呢
May we please go to the tattoo parlor?

717
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:09,470
好啊
Yeah.

718
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:18,745
Chimera墨水 没错 我想我几个月前买过一些
Chimera ink? Yeah, I think I bought some a few months ago.

719
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:20,413
有些游客想带点新奥尔良特色回家
Up sell it to the tourists when they want to

720
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:21,881
我会卖一些
bring a part of New Orleans home with them.

721
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:23,216
几乎没用过
Barely ever use it.

722
00:30:23,218 --> 00:30:24,451
能看看你的存货吗
Can we see your supply?

723
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:25,719
为什么
Why?

724
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:28,154
这跟一起正在进行的调查有关
It's in connection with an ongoing investigation.

725
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:30,123
在里屋的什么地方 你知道 我不是很...
It's somewhere in the back room, you know, I don't really have...

726
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,057
哦 不用担心 我会找出来的
Oh, don't worry, I-I can go check it out.

727
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:32,359
等等 等一下 伙计
Wait, hold on, man.

728
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:33,325
我按特定的方式整理的物品 好吗
I got it organized in a very particular way, all right?

729
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:34,960
-让我来找给你看 -好了 等等
- I'll just show you. - Okay, all right,

730
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:37,529
听着 我还有几个问题想先问你
look, I still have a few more questions for you first.

731
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:38,930
Sebastian 去吧
Sebastian, go ahead.

732
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:41,833
你见过这个人吗
You ever seen this man?

733
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:48,039
这也叫整理
This is organized?

734
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:54,979
哦 嗨 伙计 抱歉
Oh, hey, man, I'm sorry.

735
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:56,414
我没意识到你在这里
I-I didn't realize you were there.

736
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,848
哦 没事 哥们儿
Yeah, no worries, man.

737
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,049
补觉呢 哈
Catching some Z's, huh?

738
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:00,050
晚上没睡好是吗
Rough night?

739
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:01,986
可以这么说
You could say that.

740
00:31:01,988 --> 00:31:03,521
呃 你能不能帮我找一下
Uh, any chance that you could help me

741
00:31:03,523 --> 00:31:05,256
Chimera在哪儿
find the Chimera?

742
00:31:05,258 --> 00:31:06,624
找什么
The what now?

743
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:07,758
墨水
The ink.

744
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,026
哦 对 好 没问题
Oh, right. Yeah, sure.

745
00:31:10,028 --> 00:31:12,162
Chimera 是的
Chimera. Yeah.

746
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:13,897
我来帮你找 好的
I'll help you look. Okay.

747
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:18,835
我猜 呃 多数人喜欢在晚上纹身 是吧
I imagine, uh, most people get tattoos at night, huh?

748
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,104
一般人不会大清早一起床
It's not often you wake up first thing in the morning

749
00:31:21,106 --> 00:31:23,039
就说 嗨 "我想在前胸纹一个
and saying, "Hey, I want a naked lady riding a dragon

750
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,274
骑着龙的裸女"
across my chest."

751
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:26,542
是啊 听起来没错
Yeah, sounds about right.

752
00:31:32,817 --> 00:31:34,350
你在找这个 对吗
Looking for this, right?

753
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,218
哦 对 太棒了 谢谢你
Uh, yeah. That's great, thank you.

754
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,820
我想请你让一下
I'm just gonna ask you to move out of my way...

755
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:39,755
-不可以 -好吧
- Yeah, I can't do that. - Okay.

756
00:31:39,757 --> 00:31:41,423
实际上这不是个请求 我是个联邦探员
It's not really a request. See, I'm a Federal Agent.

757
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:52,967
Sebastian
Sebastian!

758
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:54,068
你还好吗
You all right?

759
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,203
我想那就是凶手
I think it was the killer.

760
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,971
他拿着枪 往后门跑了
He got a gun, he went out the back.

761
00:32:03,846 --> 00:32:05,245
从纹身店
<i>Pulled DNA</i>

762
00:32:05,247 --> 00:32:06,447
提取了DNA
from the tattoo parlor,

763
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:08,649
确认我们嫌疑人的身份是Damon Yang
identified our suspect as Damon Yang.

764
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:11,585
他加入了七鹰三合会
He's affiliated with the Seven Eagles Triad.

765
00:32:11,587 --> 00:32:13,787
他们在上海和旧金山都有基地
They're based in Shanghai and San Francisco,

766
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:15,855
Damon就是从那儿来的
where Damon is from originally.

767
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:18,123
看起来他过去几个月一直在新奥尔良
Looks like he's been in New Orleans the past few months.

768
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:20,827
平时躲在纹身店里 伺机出动
Holing up at a tattoo shop and Triad front.

769
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:22,829
纹身店经理与他们无关
The manager of the shop's not affiliated.

770
00:32:22,831 --> 00:32:25,064
对七鹰的勾当毫不知情
Knows nothing about Seven Eagles business.

771
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:27,367
那是因为七鹰本来就没什么勾当
That's because there is no Seven Eagles business.

772
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:29,101
FBI去年搜捕过他们
The FBI busted them last year.

773
00:32:29,103 --> 00:32:30,770
端掉了他们整个领导层
Shut down their entire leadership.

774
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:33,438
包括Damon的父亲 Derek Yang
Including Damon's father, Derek Yang.

775
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,274
Damon和Ethan Beck有什么关联
What's the connection between Damon and Ethan Beck?

776
00:32:36,276 --> 00:32:38,343
看起来没有任何关系
There doesn't seem to be one.

777
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:42,247
除了他是个网络犯罪专家
Except for the fact that he specializes in cyber crimes,

778
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:45,350
身份窃贼 信用卡诈骗犯
identity theft, credit card fraud.

779
00:32:45,352 --> 00:32:47,085
他很厉害
He was prodigious.

780
00:32:47,087 --> 00:32:49,354
看他脖子上的纹身
And look at his neck tat.

781
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:52,055
438
438.

782
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:55,760
三合会用数字代码来区分他们的级别
Triads use numeric codes to distinguish their ranks.

783
00:32:55,762 --> 00:32:57,361
你有什么发现么
Mean something to you?

784
00:32:57,363 --> 00:32:59,530
我一直在浏览集结者的留言板
Well, I was looking through the Collective message boards

785
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:01,231
寻找其他嫌疑人
for other suspects.

786
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,801
那儿确实有个人的昵称是 438
There was someone whose handle was “438”"

787
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:05,469
你觉得Damon是集结者成员么
Thinking Damon was a Collective member, too?

788
00:33:05,471 --> 00:33:07,871
可能他为了接近Ethan Beck而加入的
Maybe he joined up to get close to Ethan Beck.

789
00:33:07,873 --> 00:33:09,539
他们一起攻入了
They worked together on breaching

790
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:11,007
那座联邦服务器场
the Federal server farm.

791
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:13,175
然后在文件被盗以后 他杀死了Beck
Then he kills Beck after the files were stolen?

792
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:14,711
他在追查什么
What was he after?

793
00:33:14,713 --> 00:33:16,679
Elvis在研究Ethan的电脑
Elvis is working on Ethan's computer,

794
00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:18,180
正在下载全部被盗文件
downloading all the stolen files.

795
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:19,582
应该问问他
Should check with him.

796
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:21,451
继续挖掘Damon的信息
Keep digging into Damon.

797
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:24,185
查清他追踪的东西后 我们就会找到他
We find out what he was after, we find him.

798
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:27,255
另外 嗨
And, hey.

799
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:30,358
不论邮件里说了什么
No matter what any e-mails say,

800
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,660
我们首先是一个队伍
we're a team first.

801
00:33:31,662 --> 00:33:33,829
我们互相支持 对吗
We got each other's backs, right?

802
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:36,064
-是啊 -那必须的
- Yeah. - Totally.

803
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:37,332
我们很好 King
We're good, King.

804
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:40,101
带着这股热情去工作吧
Got to work on that enthusiasm.

805
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,341
有什么进展 Elvis
How you doing here, Elvis?

806
00:33:47,343 --> 00:33:48,609
我很火大
I'm pissed.

807
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:50,478
我是说 Ethan是个混球
I mean, Ethan was a son of a bitch.

808
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,146
他傲慢 他有权傲慢
He was arrogant, he was entitled,

809
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:55,049
他认为可以凭他一己之力开启世界的无政府状态
he thought he could start world anarchy all by himself.

810
00:33:55,051 --> 00:33:57,517
但他不应该这样死去
But he did not deserve to die this way.

811
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,653
-我是说 这是个耻辱 -Ethan自己做的决定
- I mean, it's humiliating. - Ethan made his own choices.

812
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:01,588
-这不是你的错 -不是吗
- That's not on you. - No?

813
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,189
我刚认识他的时候
When I met him,

814
00:34:03,191 --> 00:34:05,258
他是个专业游戏测试员 好吗
he was a professional game tester, all right?

815
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,379
我才是那个给他灌输这些思想的人
I'm the one that put all those ideas into his head.

816
00:34:07,403 --> 00:34:08,195
好吧
Okay.

817
00:34:08,196 --> 00:34:09,429
那让我们找出这个凶手
Then let's find his killer.

818
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:10,897
你找到什么了
What have you learned?

819
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:12,231
不太多
Not much.

820
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:14,100
我给这台电脑进行了全面搜查
I gave his computer a full cavity search.

821
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:17,570
发现了成千上万的机密文件
I found hundreds of thousands of classified files.

822
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,071
但我都不知道从哪儿开始
But I wouldn't even know where to start.

823
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:21,239
好吧 坐下 Elvis
O-Okay. Sit down, Elvis.

824
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:25,711
我们从 呃 Damon Yang开始
Let's start with, uh, Damon Yang.

825
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:27,346
七鹰三合会成员
Seven Eagles Triad member,

826
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:30,015
可能要对全部五起谋杀案负责
probably responsible for all five murders.

827
00:34:30,017 --> 00:34:32,149
没有Damon Yang的任何信息
I got nothing on Damon Yang.

828
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:34,452
但是那里有一个Derek Yang
But there is a Derek Yang.

829
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:36,020
Damon的父亲
Damon's father.

830
00:34:36,022 --> 00:34:37,254
前三合会领导人
Former Triad leader.

831
00:34:37,256 --> 00:34:39,891
他被逮捕 正在等待审判
He was arrested and is awaiting trial.

832
00:34:39,893 --> 00:34:41,225
是的 他被逮捕了
Yes, he was arrested.

833
00:34:41,227 --> 00:34:43,962
但是没有审判 Dwayne
But there was no trial, Dwayne.

834
00:34:43,964 --> 00:34:45,930
我看到不同的文件
These are different files that I'm looking at.

835
00:34:45,932 --> 00:34:47,999
三重加密 安全性极高
Triple encrypted, super secure.

836
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:50,066
当然 Ethan破解了它
Of course Ethan broke the code.

837
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,735
这可能就是Damon需要他的原因
That's probably why Damon needed him.

838
00:34:51,737 --> 00:34:52,903
文件里面说什么
What do the files say?

839
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:54,605
文件说 Derek跟中亚地区
It says that, uh, Derek had ties

840
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:57,741
一些很危险的激进组织有关联
to some pretty nasty radical groups in Central Asia.

841
00:34:57,743 --> 00:35:00,644
所以CIA觉得他可能很有价值
So the CIA decided that he could be a valuable asset.

842
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:03,346
他们在起诉前 把他从那个国家转移出来
And they whisked him out of the country before the indictment.

843
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:05,215
非常规引渡
Extraordinary Rendition.

844
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:06,716
没说他被带到哪儿去了
Does it say where he was taken?

845
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:08,283
没说 是个秘密行动
No, it's a black site.

846
00:35:08,285 --> 00:35:10,753
但是他们确实给出了审讯他的
But they do give the name of the clandestine operative

847
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:12,154
秘密特工的名字
that interrogated him.

848
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:13,455
Jordan Harper
Jordan Harper.

849
00:35:13,457 --> 00:35:16,458
没错 他住在路易斯安那州
Yeah, and he lives in a cabin

850
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,628
一个荒郊野岭的小木屋里
in the middle of nowhere, Louisiana.

851
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,596
Damon想通过追踪Harper来找他的父亲
Damon's going after Harper to find his father.

852
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:23,131
没错 而且他已经抢先了一步 所以你最好快点
Right, and he's got a head start on you, so you better hurry.

853
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:27,402
Harper还是没接电话
Harper's still not answering his phone.

854
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:29,905
派去调查他的州警有消息没
Any word from the state troopers we sent to check up on him?

855
00:35:29,907 --> 00:35:32,007
他们也没接电话
They aren't picking up, either.

856
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:33,207
这可不好
This isn't good.

857
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:35,010
Damon Yang可能已经到那里了
Damon Yang could be there already.

858
00:35:35,012 --> 00:35:36,344
但是Damon需要Harper
But Damon needs Harper alive

859
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:37,879
活着告诉他 他父亲在哪里
to tell him where his father is.

860
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:39,514
这给了我们一次战斗的机会
So it gives us a fighting chance.

861
00:35:39,516 --> 00:35:41,015
沿这条路还得50分钟才能到小木屋
Cabin's 50 minutes up this road.

862
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:42,616
我们快没时间了
We're running out of time.

863
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:44,217
没错 但是如果我们开着全地形车穿过树林
Yeah, but if we take the ATV through the woods,

864
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:46,153
就能在30分钟之内到达 我们开工
we'll be there in less than 30. Let's do it.

865
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:07,974
可以出发了
You're good to go.

866
00:36:11,345 --> 00:36:12,912
我们走吧
Let's roll.

867
00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:35,066
两人死亡 是州警
Two dead, troopers.

868
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:41,572
找到Harper了 没看见Damon
I see Harper. No sign of Damon.

869
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,373
他一定在这附近
Well, he's got to be here somewhere.

870
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,776
行动
Let's move.

871
00:36:59,925 --> 00:37:01,791
Damon Yang
Damon Yang!

872
00:37:01,793 --> 00:37:04,427
NCIS 你无处可逃
NCIS! You got nowhere to run!

873
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:06,929
我想我们会同归于尽
Then I guess we'll all die here together!

874
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,229
Damon 听着
Damon, listen,

875
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:29,450
我们都想和平解决
we all want to end this peacefully.

876
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:32,286
听着 现在还没人受伤 放下武器
Look, no one has to get hurt. Just put down your weapon,

877
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,788
让我们接走Harper
and let us have Harper.

878
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,024
你们想要他 来接他啊
You want him? Come and get him.

879
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:56,543
-你们在哪呢 -还有十分钟到 怎么了
- Where you guys at? - Ten minutes out. What's up?

880
00:37:56,545 --> 00:37:58,343
我们被压制正在交火
We're pinned down and we're taking fire.

881
00:37:58,345 --> 00:38:00,546
Damon把Harper放在屋里做肉盾
Damon's got Harper barricaded in the cabin.

882
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:01,263
我们需要找个路线冲进去
We need a way in.

883
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:03,563
那个小木屋可是生存主义者梦寐以求的房子
That cabin is a survivalist's dream house.

884
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:06,485
墙壁加厚 电力和安全系统是
Walls are fortified, electricity and security system run on

885
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:08,320
隔绝互联网的专用网络系统
their own dedicated network off the grid.

886
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:10,255
我是说 如果他不让你进去 你是进不去的
I mean, if he doesn't want you in, you're not getting in.

887
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:13,059
-也许吧 也许不是 -来点有用的 伙计们
- Maybe, but maybe not. - Give me something, guys!

888
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:15,093
要我说 我们用Ethan Beck对付我们的伎俩来对付小木屋
I'm say we do to that cabin what Ethan Beck did to us.

889
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:16,895
你要黑进他的系统吗
You're gonna hack the system?

890
00:38:16,897 --> 00:38:19,497
我来设定一个病毒去感染小木屋的专用网络
I'm setting up a virus to infect the cabin's dedicated network.

891
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:21,032
在系统重启之前 应该能给你们
That should give you guys about 90 seconds

892
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:22,400
大约90秒的时间
before the system reboots.

893
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:24,235
不管你要做什么 尽快去做
Whatever you do, do it fast.

894
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:25,445
老兄 你像在看达芬奇
Man, it's like watching da Vinci.

895
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,469
再说一次 很怪异
Again, creepy.

896
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:28,740
最后一次机会 告诉我
Last chance to tell me

897
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:29,741
他们把我父亲关在哪儿了
where they're keeping my father.

898
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:30,908
好了 伙计们
Okay, guys.

899
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,810
停电啦
Here goes nothing.

900
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,126
你和Harper待在一起 我去追Damon
You stay with Harper! I'm getting Damon!

901
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,551
立即放下武器
Put the weapon down now!

902
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:18,286
无路可走了 Damon
No where to go, Damon.

903
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:20,521
你被包围了
We got you covered!

904
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,683
说实话 没有任何借口
<i>Honestly, there are no excuses.</i>

905
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,786
我做过一些错误的决定
I made some bad choices.

906
00:39:52,788 --> 00:39:54,154
我并不以此为荣
And I'm not proud of them.

907
00:39:54,156 --> 00:39:56,321
你看 Amy 我也是人
Look, Amy, I'm human.

908
00:39:56,323 --> 00:39:58,490
跟任何人一样 并不完美
Flawed like anyone.

909
00:39:58,492 --> 00:40:00,759
但你知道我还有什么感受吗 感激
But you know what else I am? Grateful.

910
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:03,962
我感激自己能向NCIS提供有价值的协助
That I was able to provide valuable assistance to NCIS

911
00:40:03,964 --> 00:40:05,397
在更多人受到伤害之前
and put an end to this madness

912
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:07,365
解决了这堆烂摊子
before anyone else got hurt.

913
00:40:08,468 --> 00:40:10,368
哦 英雄Hamilton
Oh, Hamilton the hero.

914
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,104
真是狡猾
What a snake.

915
00:40:12,106 --> 00:40:14,405
他会毫发无损地从这件事中抽身而出
He's gonna walk away from this whole thing unscathed.

916
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:16,340
你这么想吗
You think so?

917
00:40:16,342 --> 00:40:19,410
哦 我知道那种语气 Dwayne
Ooh, I know that tone, Dwayne.

918
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:21,045
你和市长较量过几回合
You've gone a few rounds with the mayor,

919
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:23,014
对吧
haven't you?

920
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:25,249
还有好几个回合要进行呢
And I have a few more rounds left to go.

921
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:26,550
好啊 兄弟
Well, brother,

922
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:28,252
如果到了那时候
if the time ever comes,

923
00:40:28,254 --> 00:40:30,720
我会很乐意帮你给那个小人做点记号
I'd love to help you take that creep down a notch or three.

924
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:33,256
现在 我要走了
Until then, I'm out of here.

925
00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:34,991
走前不一起喝个离别酒吗
Leaving without a good-bye drink?

926
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:37,994
哦 我计划离开时扫荡了你的酒柜
Oh, I raided your cabinet when I was planning my exit.

927
00:40:37,996 --> 00:40:40,430
什么 至少来趟酒吧
What? At least come down

928
00:40:40,432 --> 00:40:42,265
好吗 跟团队一起庆祝一下
to the bar, all right? Celebrate with the team.

929
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:42,786
来吧
Come on.

930
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,810
团队 团队是你的风格 老兄
Team? Team is your thing, my friend.

931
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,736
我不是这样
My thing is different.

932
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:49,038
顺便 我会给你的人发点儿东西
By the way, I'm sending your people a little something

933
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,373
好让你们记住我
to remember me by.

934
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:52,574
哦 这听起来不是什么好事
Well, that sounds ominous.

935
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,476
不会的
Nah.

936
00:40:54,478 --> 00:40:56,979
只是用我的方式来表达谢意
It's just my way of saying thank you.

937
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:00,282

看都别看
without looking at them.

-我觉得这是个好主意 -好的
