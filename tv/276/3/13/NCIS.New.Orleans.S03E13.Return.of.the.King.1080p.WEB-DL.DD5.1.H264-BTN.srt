1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,741
      (indistinct chatter)

2
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:11,110
             WOMAN:
       Nice room, fancy.

3
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:12,511
              MAN:
         It's not bad.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,179
          I stay here
  whenever I'm in town, so...

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,581
             WOMAN:
       That's nice, baby.

6
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,182
      Now, let's get that
       silly jacket off.

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,317
              MAN:
            Maybe...

8
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,486
50 bucks says
he chickens out.

9
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,755
No way. He just shelled out
like a month's salary.

10
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,656
He's locked and loaded.
         He's way over his head.

11
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,225
         Look how fidgety he is.

12
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,127
It's his first time
with a working girl.

13
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,661
You're some kind
of mind reader?

14
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:32,197
 We've watched a million videos
           like this,

15
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,733
  giving me disturbing insight
     into the male psyche.

16
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:35,734
             WOMAN:
     Let's get to business.

17
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,803
              MAN:
        Really? Whoa...

18
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,272
      (silenced gunshots)

19
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,775
                       No, wait!

20
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,476
           (panting)

21
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,812
            Please.
   You don't have to do this.

22
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,349
      (silenced gunshots)

23
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,818

00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,521

00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,616
      (nearby clattering)

00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,797
    (faint blips and beeps)

33
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,368
Whoever's there,
identify yourself!

34
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,337
              Ow!
           (groaning)

35
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,371
Sorry. It's me.

36
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,207
        It's Sebastian.

37
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,375
First day on the job,
I got a little excited,

38
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,643
I couldn't sleep,
so I figured

39
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,145
       I'd just come in.

40
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,446
    At 5:00 in the morning.

41
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,848
Thought I'd just
get a head start on things,

42
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,283
maybe unpack my stuff.

43
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,855
Anyway, where should
I put my stuff?

44
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:06,391
I haven't gotten you a desk yet.
Still figuring out logistics.

45
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,559
 Okay. All right, that's fine.

46
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,861
I'll just,
uh...

47
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,363
         I'll just hold
       onto this for now.

48
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,666
  We'll find a place for you.

49
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,835
Oh, totally. Yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

50
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,438
Just, I'm so nervous,
you know?

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,573
Like, "first day at school
and you don't know anyone"

52
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,442
kind of nervous,
but that's strange, right?

53
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,743
'Cause I,
I know everyone here.

54
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,678
    Never easy taking a new job.

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,747
           Especially
    on an experienced team.

56
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,384
   But you're here for a reason.

57
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,721
     You'll do great. I promise.

58
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,556
             And...

59
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,860
       ...I got something

60
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,929
            for you.

61
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,306
Your service weapon.

62
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,208
        Welcome to NCIS.

63
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,611
Forensics Agent Lund.

64
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,480
           This is...

65
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,315
   this is really happening.

66
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,284
        (phone beeping)

67
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,322
          So's this...

68
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,957
      Four dead bodies...
      Including a sailor.

69
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,560
        Yes! All right.

70
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,828
    Man, that's insensitive.
           I'm sorry.

71
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,964
  Just first case as an agent,
           you know?

72
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,400
     Yeah. Gonna be great.

73
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,672
        (sirens wailing)

74
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,578
            LASALLE:
   Lieutenant Annabelle Shaw.

75
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,546
      Computer specialist
      out of Belle Chase.

76
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,982
Navy sent her here to help
install a software update,

77
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:40,419
   along with her co-worker,
          Eric Smith.

78
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,821
        DoD contractor.

79
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,591
Killer or killers
come through that door,

80
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,825
         guns blazing.

81
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,860
                       Takes out
                      the guard,

82
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,430
    Mr. Smith and Lt. Shaw?

83
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,365
  What exactly is this place?

84
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,301
It's a federal data sharing...
Well, some short of data farm...

85
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,903
        I'm sorry. Do--?
         Is it my turn?

86
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,305
   Just trying to figure out
  the-the briefing etiquette.

87
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,408
     Go for it, my friend.

88
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,277
All right.
It's a Federal server farm,

89
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,947
where different agencies at DoD
and DOJ share and analyze intel.

90
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,016
  Yeah. FBI, CIA, Navy Intel--

91
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,918
       all of them store
       their files here.

92
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,653
       High-value target.

93
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,688
   Assuming data was stolen?

94
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,424
Yeah. Over a thousand terabytes
 worth, according to this log.

95
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,295
   We're talking about a massive
    breach of national security.

96
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,697
 Oh! I just can't get over it.
           (chuckles)

97
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,267
  Aww. You're all grown up...

98
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,835
   Okay. All right. You know,
    I'm trying to work here.

99
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:30,969
Oh, right. Yes, of course.
(clears throat)

100
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,971
There's a fourth victim outside.

101
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,407
        Also shot twice.

102
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,775
How many suspects we looking at?

103
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,277
      Uh, it's too soon to tell,

104
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,845
           but I'd say just one.

105
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,547
        Each victim has a double
               tap to the chest.

106
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,449
     Someone was very handy
         with a weapon.

107
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,851
  Handy with electronics, too.

108
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,686
Entire security system,
including surveillance

109
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,987
is taken offline.

110
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,292
   Oh. I'm sorry about that.

111
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,060
       Trying to work out
       the timing, still.

112
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,830
 Okay. All right. So we've got
     what could be one man

113
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,932
         who breaks in,

114
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,869
         undetected, kills four,

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,737
          steals massive amounts

116
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,873
   of sensitive government data.

117
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,474
Probably espionage.

118
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,010
Should talk to DoD
and DOJ, ASAP.

119
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,013
       Yeah. I'll have Sonja and
      Gregorio contact them now.

120
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,683
                In the meantime,
      Christopher. Let's start--

121
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:18,784
excuse me--
           Hmm? Yeah.

122
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,752
    pulling surveillance footage

123
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,920
from other buildings
in the area.

124
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,022
                     You got it.
   Oh, I'll go with Lasalle.

125
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,757
    No, no, no. You're okay.
         You stay here.

126
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,694
          Work with Loretta. Lot
         of evidence to process.

127
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,896
  That's a good idea. Not just
   physical evidence, either.

128
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,899
    Whoever did this must've
     left a digital trace.

129
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,967
         Patton's out of town at
           some I.T. conference,

130
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,669
     but we should probably
          contact him.

131
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,905
     Good idea. Do it now.

132
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,973
We need to find whoever did this

133
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,543
     before the stolen data
    gets in the wrong hands.

134
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,878
      (moaning over video)

135
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,385
  That just looks uncomfortable.

136
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,387
Everything about it.

137
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,091
         I know we keep
       it casual at NCIS,

138
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,926
          but it seems
    like you're pushing it.

139
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,627
      We're workin' here.
   (taps key, moaning stops)

140
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,930
Thought you were contacting
DoD and DOJ.

141
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,898
      Well, both agencies
   reported an attempted hack

142
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,700
       of the facilities
         two weeks ago.

143
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,703
  That's why Lieutenant Shaw was
   sent here to update software,

144
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,138
       strengthen cyber defense.

145
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,706
  Any idea who the hacker was?

146
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,041
None. But it's our guess,

147
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,776
it's the same person
as the killer.

148
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,010
          This is part
     of what he was stole.

149
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,046
Surveillance from FBI

150
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,648
of a major prostitution ring.

151
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,550
          I know him.

152
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,686
           It's Councilman Long.

153
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,920
   Well, how'd you find this?

154
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,088
                      We didn't.
                   It went viral

155
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,523
                    an hour ago.

156
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,125
GREGORIO:
A long with eight other videos

157
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,159
of prominent New Orleanians.

158
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,161
All a part of the stolen files.

159
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,096
        And each of our subjects
             are under some form

160
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,631
               of investigation.

161
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:40,866
     Internet's blowing up.

162
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,501
  Videos are getting thousands
            of hits.

163
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,703
        It's straight up
      public humiliation.

164
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,905
Doesn't sound
like espionage to me.

165
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,707
        (computer beeps)

166
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,776
   Ah, hey. It's the new guy.

167
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,611
        I can say that,
 'cause I've been here a week.

168
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,679
Welcome aboard, newbie.

169
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,881
   You got something for us?

170
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,949
  I'd say. Found epidermis cells

171
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:01,086
        at the scene that didn't
       match any of our victims.

172
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,688
But they did match
a very likely suspect.

173
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,756
Ethan Beck.

174
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,591
                          PRIDE:
                     Ethan Beck?

175
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,594
 So. All right. So you've heard
      of Anonymous, right?

176
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,862
           Of course.

177
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,497
Okay. Well, Ethan Beck
and his people

178
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,599
are, like, ten times better.
And their mission

179
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,002
is to expose corruption
wherever it is.

180
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,570
 So where do we find this guy?

181
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,005
Well, that's the thing.
You don't really find him.

182
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:23,074
He finds you. He's like a...
like a phantom.

183
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,778
I'm expecting a "but"
right about now.

184
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,748
But there was a failed hack
attempt on the facility

185
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,982
a couple weeks back...

186
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,117
And Patton was able
to find out

187
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,752
where that hack came from.

188
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,921
And I'm gonna send you
those details right now.

189
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,492
The abandoned restaurant
on Lake Pontchartrain.

190
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,928
Yeah. Actually, there's activity
 on the I.P. address right now.

191
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,162
Somebody's still there.

192
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,497
      Could be our killer.

193
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,199
Gregorio, you're with me.

194
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,912
NCIS!

195
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,147
     Hands where we can see 'em.

196
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,582
Slow!

197
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,120
         (short laugh)

198
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,922
                          Elvis!

199
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,259
Dwayne Pride.

200
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,895
Of all the gin joints
in all the towns, and look,

201
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,830
 you brought your little buddy
         with you, too.
       Should've guessed,

202
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,999
          if we had a major hack
         job, we'd run into you.

203
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,701
  I know what you're thinking.

204
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,970
 This looks really bad for me.

205
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,606
     but this time I swear
        I did not do it.

206
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,907
             Right.

207
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,023
           GREGORIO: Hands where
                  I can see 'em.

208
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,158
   I am having a raging bout
     of déjà vu right now.

209
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,227
        Dwayne, tell her
       I'm not dangerous.

210
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,795
         Last time we dealt with
             you, you were armed

211
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:51,830
        and almost shot a woman.

212
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:52,864
She's got a point, Elvis.

213
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,000
    Out of context, unfair.

214
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,935
         And that woman
     sort of had it coming.

215
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,303
         Can I cuff him, please?

216
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,671
Not yet, New York.

217
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:00,872
Elvis,
this restaurant

218
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,174
was the source of a hack attempt

219
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,176
   on a Federal server farm.

220
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,780
  A facility where four people
   were killed this morning.

221
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,882
 Right. So you think it's, uh,

222
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,817
   suspicious that I'm here,

223
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,220
considering my past
miscommunications

224
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,155
         with the law.

225
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,690
   Um, by miscommunications,
          do you mean

226
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,192
  multiple felony convictions?
           Then, yes.

227
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,662
       I'm not the felon
      you're looking for.

228
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,163
    His name is Ethan Beck.

229
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,233
     How do you know that?

230
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,901
'Cause I'm looking for him, too.

231
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,304
   He runs a hacktivist group
     called the Collective.

232
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,972
     More like a terrorist
         organization,

233
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,107
exposing people's dirty secrets.

234
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,777
 No. The Collective was founded
     to create transparency

235
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,245
     and expose corruption.

236
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,713
 Well, right now, it's exposing

237
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,316
prominent folks' personal lives.

238
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,117
        Yeah, and that's
     really pissing me off.

239
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,953
        Why do you care?

240
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,788
    Because my reputation's
           at stake.

241
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,257
              Because he created
                 the Collective.

242
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,793
 Yeah. I created it with Ethan.

243
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,227
       He was my protégé.

244
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,730
But he let his ego
get the best of him,

245
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,198
          and it's not
    about the cause anymore.

246
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,234
    It's about Ethan proving
      how powerful he is.

247
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:07,205
  And that's why you guys have
  to let me help you find him.

248
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,841
        Talk about ego.
 We can handle this, all right?

249
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,744
Dwayne, you don't have any idea
who you're dealing with.

250
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,614
Do you? He's hard to track.
Listen.

251
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,148
        He's taken down
     Fortune 500 companies.

252
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,351
He's brought government agencies
        to their knees.

253
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,152
And he's never
been caught.

254
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,021
        He's dangerous.

255
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,889
               Elvis, Ethan Beck
           murdered four people,

256
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,093
    including a Navy Lieutenant.
         We know he's dangerous.

257
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,761
          Good point.

258
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,630
     But you got to let me
       help you find him.
        (phone beeping)

259
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,698
I taught him every trick
he knows.

260
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,899
I am the one guy

261
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,768
who could track this dude down.

262
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,704
            Please.

263
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,308
                       Gregorio?
Yeah?

264
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,844
        Take Elvis back to NCIS.

265
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,646
              Set up him up with
              whatever he needs.

266
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,847
           For real?

267
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,248
      Don't look so upset.

268
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,050
           (chuckles)
         I don't bite.

269
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,653
(laughs)
Unless you ask real nice.

270
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,187
      Where are you going?

271
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,657
     Summoned by the mayor.

272
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,796
          TV REPORTER:
   Mayor Douglas Hamilton...

273
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,132
  They got my e-mails, Dwayne.

274
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,934
                      Do you...?
            They got my e-mails!

275
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,236
                      All right?
             Posted them online.

276
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,937
 Hundreds of private messages.

277
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,072
    You're not the only one.

278
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,007
     Come on, the reporters
          asking que--

279
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,375
     They're all over the place.
        You've seen them, right?

280
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,710
          ...intimately involved
      with your press secretary.

281
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:19,944
  Uh, I have nothing to say...

282
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:20,979
        I've got nobody, though,

283
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:21,980
      to field questions for me,

284
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,081
  because my press secretary's

285
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,349
    husband made her resign.

286
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,418
       I've got multiple
      homicides to solve,

287
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,019
can we cut to the chase?

288
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:30,855
     You're enjoying this,
           ain't ya?

289
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,257
                     (laughing):
                      I can see.

290
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,958
     You're enjoying this,
       just a little bit.

291
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,794
     Your point, Mr. Mayor?

292
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,964
           Now, I know you think
             that I'm a bad guy.

293
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,233
              Right? That, uh...

294
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,235
 I'm only interested in myself.

295
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,771
    If history is any guide.

296
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:51,009
      I'm screwed, Dwayne.
      Oh, yeah. I'm done.

297
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,712
           And there's nothing I
          can do about that now,

298
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,247
      but innocent people
       are getting hurt.

299
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,982
         Private lives
      are getting exposed.

300
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,819
      And this could be very bad
       for a lot of good people.

301
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,488
                We agree on that
                 much, don't we?

302
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,725
    I can be useful to you.

303
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,927
             I can pull strings.

304
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,030
    I could give you access
 to resources if you need them.

305
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:16,401
              Whatever you need.
              Just say the word.

306
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,971
    Let's fix this together.

307
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,908
 Might be something you can do.

308
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,782
          Uh... you...

309
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,217
         you're, uh...

310
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,985
                      (chuckles)
                       I mean...

311
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,453
 Are you having a stroke, kid?

312
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,756
      Seriously, do I have
  to give you mouth to mouth?

313
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,090
           I'm Elvis.

314
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,492
        Oh, yeah, yeah,
  I know exactly who you are.

315
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,393
 You're-you're a personal hero.

316
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,895
          I hope that
     doesn't sound strange.

317
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,964
       No, no, that's not
         creepy at all.

318
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,432
      It's just, your work
   is pretty much the reason

319
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,467
      I got into computers
      in the first place.

320
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,270
     Okay, now I feel old,
   but also a bit flattered.

321
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,371
           Thank you.

322
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,873
What are you doing here?

323
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,308
             I'm trying to track
                down Ethan Beck.

324
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,144
            Sorry, I didn't know
            this is your office,

325
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,445
                   but you got a
              killer setup here.

326
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,213
    Oh, yeah, it is killer,
       but it's not mine.

327
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,782
I don't really have
an office, per se.

328
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:04,883
I-I'm kind of new.
              Okay.

329
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,417
    Actually, I'm very new.

330
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,186
           Although,
  I've also been around a lot,

331
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,821
so, it's all
very complicated.

332
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,824
    Anyway, I'm-I'm supposed
    to find Ethan Beck, too.

333
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,058
                     Okay, good.
                    Cop a squat.

334
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,093
                Let's get at it.

335
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,028
All right.

336
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,164
      Um, uh, over there's good.

337
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,498
That's probably good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:27,238
        Now, Ethan is a hard guy
        to track down, you know?

339
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,177
     Not easy to trace, but, uh,
      we got a work-around here.

340
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:35,446
         We got all the Internet
    traffic for the entire city.

341
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,183
Whoa, how did you--?
                         Not me,
                     your mayor.

342
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,485
    He took a break from bedding
   his employees to help us out.

343
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,320
            Thanks to your boss.

344
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,857
  So... so, if Ethan's sifting
through all these stolen files,

345
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:48,092
 and he's posting them online,
      then he's gonna need

346
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,061
      a high concentration
      of bandwidth, right?

347
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,496
        Right, and Ethan
   doesn't do the grunt work,

348
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,132
     so one of his minions
        does it for him.

349
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,967
        So, if we trace
    the low-hanging fruit...

350
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,235
We can trade up to the big dog.

351
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,138
                   That's right.
All right. Yeah!
This is fun.

352
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,472
                     Yeah, yeah,
               eyes front. Yeah.

353
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,074
             Okay.

354
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,442
  I've got some heavy traffic

355
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,211
   coming from a coffee shop
        in The Quarter.

356
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,346
                  Good job, kid.
            Call in the cavalry.

357
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,381
Actually, I am the cavalry.

358
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,517
 Actually, I need you to help me
     find the other Collectives.

359
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,053
    Oh, okay, yeah.
     Let's do it.
                    Yeah. Right.

360
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,988
  By here, I mean of course...
Back over there. Sure.

361
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,022
I'm gonna call Lasalle.

362
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,290
  Pretty much always over there.

363
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,626
Oh, this is great.

364
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,496
Like Batman and Robin,
except a cooler Robin.

365
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,900
Coffee shop's up here
on the corner.

366
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,268
         It's official.

367
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,071
   Mayor Hamilton's sex tape
        just went wide.

368
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,539
They got him with
his press secretary.

369
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,174
       No. Someone else.
        A friend's wife.

370
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,443
                     I feel bad.
For Hamilton?

371
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,246
     For him, the woman, anybody
  who has their privacy invaded.

372
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,448
                  I mean, we all
               have secrets, no?
        Not everyone.

373
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,883
Agreed.

374
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,351
         Okay, you got
    a couple of saints here.

375
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,419
Well, you live a decent life,
you got nothing to hide.

376
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,958
                          SONJA:
            Check out Mr. Robot.

377
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,293
                        LASALLE:
        Yeah, Mohawk, piercings,

378
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,294
could be our guy.

379
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,165
                   Excuse me.

380
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,901
                 Federal agents.

381
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:03,902
                 Need to ask you
                a few questions.

382
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,603
We got a rabbit.

383
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,115
Easy now.
                     Get off me.

384
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,919
            (grunts)

385
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,453
Attica! Attica!

386
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,455
    I'm gonna let you ladies
        handle this one.

387
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,562
PRIDE:
Thank you, Roy.

388
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,331
  You're in a lot of trouble,
             Aviva.

389
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,933
  Assaulting a Federal agent.

390
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,068
    Your guy manhandled me.

391
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,470
    You got bigger problems.

392
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,675
 We know that you're connected

393
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,544
   to a major security breach
     at a Federal facility.

394
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,180
      That you've released
 sensitive data to the public.

395
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,581
        You're a member
       of the Collective,

396
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,717
  and you work for Ethan Beck.

397
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,686
           Prove it.

398
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,221
   Everything we need to know

399
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,023
is right here in your computer.

400
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,092
          Boot it up.

401
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,627
 Try and access the hard drive.

402
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,095
               See what happens.

403
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,697
      Booby trapped, huh?

404
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,231
              Wow.

405
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,633
             Smart.

406
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,501
             AVIVA:
   At a level you can't even

407
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,103
     begin to contemplate.

408
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,639
         The Collective
      isn't afraid of laws

409
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,543
    or consequences or cops.

410
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,511
That's fair enough.

411
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:26,184
But... I'm not the one you
need to worry about right now.

412
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,060
     Do you know who I am?

413
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,997
      I'm Elvis Bertrand.

414
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,465
            No way.

415
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,267
    And your worst nightmare
  is coming true in real time,

416
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,004
      because I don't care
      about laws or rules

417
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,306
or pathetic booby traps
on your hard drive.

418
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,274
You are gonna cooperate with us,

419
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,543
or I'm gonna expose
every move you've made

420
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,012
   as a so-called hacktivist

421
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,047
to the whole world.

422
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,315
            (scoffs)

423
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,452
            (sighs)

424
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,654
       What do you want?

425
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,724
Want you to contact Ethan Beck.

426
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:13,031
Just reach out to him,
and I will do the rest.

427
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,309
                           Okay.

428
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,778
                 I hope you know
              what you're doing,

429
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,047
               'cause he doesn't
               like to be found.

430
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,681
ELVIS:
Now, I'm just running

431
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:34,252
a little, elegant,
backtrace program I devised,

432
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:38,423
and it will attack his computer
 before he knows what hit him.

433
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,324
(chuckles)

434
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,293
              Ooh.

435
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,729
        That's not good.

436
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,331
             Elvis.

437
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,636
   Any idea what's going on?

438
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,088
   I did not do it. I swear.

439
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:54,539
ELVIS:
You didn't do this.
Ethan did.

440
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,180
I heard you were looking for me.

441
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,716
  Can you trace his location?

442
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,385
I'll try, but he's got
control of our whole network.

443
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,719
        You've uncovered
       the hornet's nest

444
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,788
  and woken a sleeping giant.

445
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,490
     Okay, I'm gonna ignore
     your agregious overuse

446
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,225
   of mixed metaphors, Ethan,

447
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,727
  and ask you, "What the hell
   is your problem, buddy?!"

448
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,730
    Elvis, you're a traitor
         to the cause.

449
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,365
   I refuse to speak to you.

450
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,769
      What cause justifies
   the murder of four people?

451
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,771
  I won't listen to your lies.

452
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,373
        You have no idea
   what you're talking about

453
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,875
  or who you're messing with.

454
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,144
            (shouts)

455
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,346
           Sebastian!
     How is he doing that?

456
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,781
         I don't know,
     but it's kind of cool.

457
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,583
            (shouts)

458
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,153
      Okay, Ethan, Ethan,
      listen to me, buddy.

459
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,554
                 This isn't you.

460
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,223
  I need you to come in here.

461
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,791
      Stop looking for me.

462
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,759
        Sorry, we can't
      oblige you of that.

463
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:51,162
  Then you'll all pay for it.

464
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,363
            (shouts)

465
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:03,274
         Okay, well...

466
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,143
   that could've gone better.

467
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:20,758
    This whole Wizard of Oz
    act doesn't exactly mesh

468
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,461
  with a suspect willing to kill
      four people in cold blood.

469
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,763
 Well, contradiction we can try
 to explain after we find him.

470
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,467
Please, tell me you have another
way of tracing Ethan Beck?

471
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,568
  Not off the top of my head.

472
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,403
He's gone deep underground,

473
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,238
probably unplugging
completely.

474
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,873
               So we don't trace
                  him digitally.

475
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,642
            Never gonna outsmart
             him online, anyway.

476
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,577
Ooh, that hurts my feelings.

477
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,779
       Focus on who he is
   in the real world instead.

478
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,448
         You're talking
     about pattern of life?

479
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,684
Um, what is this
"pattern of life"?

480
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,286
      Profiling technique.

481
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,488
     We gather every detail
    we know about a suspect.

482
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,589
                   What he eats,
                  what he wears,

483
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:52,924
    kind of music he likes.

484
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:53,958
   Especially irregularities.

485
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,359
 Any unusual traits or habits.

486
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,794
     Okay, where to start?

487
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,796
 Well, you got a guy that sits

488
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,365
alone at home in front
of a computer screen.

489
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,434
        Weirdness comes
      with the territory.

490
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,369
         We put it all
  into an analytical program,

491
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,238
  and then we got a good shot
        at finding him.

492
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,606
     And you actually think
         that'll work?

493
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:11,909
We tracked your sorry ass
not too long ago.

494
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:15,446
 You know, I think if you gave
me a shot, we could become pals.

495
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,248
            Really?
             Yeah.

496
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,250
                     We're about
                    to find out.

497
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,851
   Elvis, sit with Gregorio.
      (cell phone beeping)

498
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,589
         Tell her everything she
      needs to know about Ethan.

499
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,757
   Okay. Got the power going.

500
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,626
The Internet's booting back up,

501
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:29,827
         so all in all,
       we're in business.

502
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,562
     Good work, Sebastian.

503
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,763
Loretta's got something,
so, Sebastian,

504
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,265
        you're with me.
           Let's go.

505
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,767
Sorry, excuse me.

506
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,402
            I'm gonna be honest.
     I'm a little afraid of you.

507
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,637
         Just a little?

508
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,505
        You got to learn
     to take a compliment.

509
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,409
       Wait, what are all
         these e-mails?

510
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,444
Some kind of glitch
or something?

511
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,645
      Those aren't your e-mails.

512
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,513
     That Ethan sure works fast.

513
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,615
Works fast at what?

514
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,951
           At-at creating chaos.

515
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,721
Yo, the Internet's back up.

516
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,256
            I know.

517
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,391
              I just got a crazy
              amount of e-mails.

518
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,627
Yeah, me, too,
and it's not good.

519
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,529
These are ATF files
from your undercover days.

520
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,532
Whoa. Are you kidding me?
How'd that happen?

521
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,334
              Well, I'm assuming
                 it's Ethan Beck

522
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,603
      making good on his threat.

523
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,538
Well, you need
to get rid of those.

524
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,274
          Yeah, I'm all over it.

525
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,508
              Hey, and you might
             want to do the same

526
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,676
                 with whatever's
                  in your inbox.

527
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,478
             Yeah.

528
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,615
            (gasps)

529
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,021
 Yeah, I probably should have.

530
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,522
            Oh, boy.

531
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:32,523
What'd you get?

532
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,509
Just an e-mail from you to Pride

533
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,494
  saying that you don't think
 I should be added to the team.

534
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,562
    Your undercover identity
        was just exposed

535
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,897
       and you're pissed
        about an e-mail

536
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,399
taken completely out of context?

537
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,701
       Oh, by all means,
      give me the context.

538
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,069
  Well, I didn't know you yet,
       and couldn't tell

539
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,904
       how you would mix
     with the team dynamic.

540
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,507
 I took a bullet for the team.
    How's that for dynamic?

541
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,876
    And you proved yourself
 a hundred times since, to me.

542
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:54,578
And me to you, right?

543
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,980
       We should probably
       stop reading these

544
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,648
 before someone else gets hurt.

545
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,894
  Well, since Sebastian's busy
     waging cyber-warfare,

546
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,796
       I had another tech
      analyze the bullets

547
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,731
 from Lieutenant Shaw's murder.

548
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,333
               Well, those slugs
              were in fragments.

549
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,001
            You were able to get
             a ballistics match?

550
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,403
         No, something
      far more intriguing:

551
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,939
                  traces of ink.

552
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,607
Ink? What kind of ink?

553
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,809
 Printer, pen? I mean, there's

554
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,377
       literally hundreds
      of classifications.

555
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,646
    I don't know, Sebastian,
  but the sample was so small,

556
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,548
     I wouldn't want anyone
    to touch it, except you.

557
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,250
      That's a good call.

558
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,951
   Capillary electrophoresis
 is not for the faint of heart.

559
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,823
This Ethan Beck is proving to be
as elusive as he is dangerous.

560
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,691
                 He threw us all
                     for a loop.

561
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,527
And I've never seen Elvis
afraid of anyone.

562
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,397
  Worried Beck will come back,
         guns blazing.

563
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,132
PRIDE: It's not just guns
I'm afraid of here.

564
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,667
                           WADE:
                 A scandal then?

565
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:50,801
                       Like with
                 Mayor Hamilton?

566
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,104
PRIDE:
Well, not just him.

567
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:54,472
A lot of New Orleanians
are reeling today

568
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:55,873
because of Ethan Beck.

569
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,075
       I'm gonna go, uh,
    process this in my lab.

570
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,910
     No need to wait, which
should come as a relief to you,

571
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,078
since you won't have to
worry about

572
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,047
my inability in the field
for a while.

573
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,651
      Okay, what was that about?

574
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:08,919
          Not a clue.

575
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,021
         (phone beeps)

576
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,626
        Rains, it pours.

577
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,997
 TV REPORTER: Mayor Hamilton is
    once again in hot water.

578
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,732
 A sex tape featuring the mayor

579
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,568
 and an unidentified woman has
    been released online...

580
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,670
    They got videos, Dwayne.

581
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,973
                           Of me

582
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:31,776
with different women.

583
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,010
         More staffers?

584
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:34,545
         (TV turns off)

585
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,447
            Well, that's not the
               point now, is it?

586
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,416
                    Why the hell
                 is there video?

587
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:39,550
         Couldn't say.

588
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,585
       Couldn't or won't?

589
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,855
  My e-mails are on a Federal
   law enforcement database.

590
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,590
                           Okay.

591
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,125
               This day and age,
                   that happens.

592
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,427
                We live with it.

593
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,829
        But the video--

594
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,798
  well, that means that I'm...

595
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,900
         actively under
     investigation, right?

596
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,837
I'm not investigating you,
if that's your question.

597
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,007
  Not... currently, at least.

598
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:05,976
Well, you've thrown
a lot of accusations my way.

599
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:10,214
You know, the Javier Garcia
case, most recently.

600
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:13,984
      Garcia was murdered.
         You know that.

601
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,120
         (smacks lips)
              But,

602
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,556
 if there's something specific

603
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:19,957
      you want to confess,
         I'm all ears.

604
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,194
(sighs)
Well, Dwayne,

605
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:27,832
if this day
has proven anything,

606
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:31,135
it's that everybody
has a secret, even you.

607
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:35,239
And if someone were motivated
to look hard enough,

608
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,174
who knows what they would find?

609
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,648
          Here we go.

610
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,222
        GREGORIO:<i> Look,</i>
 <i> you've seen what you've seen.</i>

611
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:52,690
         You can't take it back.

612
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,675
That's your response?

613
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,659
 You told Isler we were a pair
       of cartel imbeds.

614
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,895
         I said it was possible!

615
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,864
And that we were
sleeping together? Ew!

616
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:02,566
    Look, you got a vibe, that's
       all I'm saying. Honestly?

617
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,735
     It's kind of obvious.
  Have you watched yourselves?

618
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,304
       No, but you have.

619
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:07,872
Been surveilling us
for weeks, taking photos.

620
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,206
That's why the FBI
brought me here,

621
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,708
to investigate you.
You know that!

622
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,942
        Yeah, but that's
      our personal lives.

623
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,044
                Do you know what
           surveillance entails?

624
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,613
               And I cleared you
             both anyways, so...

625
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:17,047
   Oh, I feel so much better.

626
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,183
    Good! 'Cause now we can
     talk about what I got.

627
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,017
          What about what we...?

628
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,719
            Enough!

629
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,587
         You understand

630
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,189
this is exactly
what Ethan Beck wants.

631
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,891
     Throw us off our game,
          confuse us.

632
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:29,126
So he can get away.
You gonna let that happen?

633
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,594
   It's called Shadenfreude.

634
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:31,996
           I'll say.

635
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:33,264
       It's an algorithm
      I created years ago

636
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:34,765
    to go after mouthy CEOs.

637
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,201
It culls e-mails,

638
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,270
     looking for sensitive
  information about coworkers.

639
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:41,739
             And I created it to
              expose corruption.

640
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:43,240
     But Ethan has used it
          on you guys.

641
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,576
   Any progress locating him?

642
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,578
   We aggregated every detail
          we can find

643
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,281
on Ethan Beck's personal habits
       and idisyncrasies.

644
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:52,550
There's a lot.
He's afraid of heights,

645
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,817
              so he's not living
                 in a high-rise.

646
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,819
     He's also a recovering
         heroin addict,

647
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,288
         a big believer
      in the twelve steps.

648
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,689
       Okay, so he needs
      to be near meetings.

649
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,224
ELVIS: And then
you add to that,

650
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,825
          the paranoia that goes
             with the territory,

651
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,661
                 going after the
                  very powerful.

652
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,229
       He likes mobility,

653
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,796
    has to be able to escape
     at a moment's notice.

654
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,098
    Okay, well around here,

655
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,967
             water's the fastest
            way out, so, a boat.

656
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,836
Okay, how do we narrow it
further?

657
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,640
                          ELVIS:
                          Pizza.

658
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,109
       Ethan is obsessed
     with wood oven pizza.

659
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,780
And he has to have it delivered
         at all hours.

660
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,782
PRIDE:
We got a hit.

661
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:25,783
      Shell Beach Marina.

662
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:26,850
              Gregorio, with me.

663
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,285
                     Let's move.

664
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:35,059
       (seagulls cawing)

665
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:38,329
 High-speed Internet satellite.

666
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,198
              This is the place.

667
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:54,278
         NCIS, hands where I can
             see 'em, right now.

668
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,221
            Syringe.

669
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,103
  Pride, you need to see this!

670
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,907
         Suicide note.

671
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:26,310
       This guy's in the
      middle of a crusade,

672
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,911
        exposing people
         left and right

673
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,113
     and just offs himself?

674
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,714
  Does that seem right to you?

675
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:34,918
Nothing about this seems right.

676
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:54,304
Ethan Beck had
a hundred milligrams

677
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,874
of nearly pure heroin
in his bloodstream.

678
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,343
No one would have been able
to inject that much.

679
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,246
He would have passed out
before completing the dose.

680
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,847
          This man was murdered.

681
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,283
Yet someone wants us to think
he committed suicide.

682
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,752
You think he had an accomplice?

683
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:11,121
          Beck may have released
              confidential files

684
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,790
                   and videos on
                   the Internet,

685
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,124
                  thrown my team
                   into disarray

686
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,359
         by hacking our e-mails,

687
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,062
                 but breaching a
               federal facility?

688
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20,064
And expertly killing
four people?

689
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,434
          Yeah, Mr. Beck was not
          in the pink of health.

690
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:26,070
     He would have gotten winded
       answering the front door,

691
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,404
              let alone storming
                      the gates.

692
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,006
Well then, what?

693
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:32,409
Someone planted Ethan's DNA
at our crime scene?

694
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,278
                   Set him up to
                  take the fall?

695
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,846
  Why go to all that trouble?

696
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:39,116
 Elvis and the rest of the team

697
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:41,318
     are searching through
   Ethan's computer right now

698
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,187
        for the answer,

699
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:46,190
         provided they aren't at
     each other's throats again.

700
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,225
              Mm.
 Still dissention in the ranks?

701
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,027
    Honestly, I'm surprised
       how little it took

702
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:51,328
   to throw us off our game.

703
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,930
No one's off their game, Dwayne.

704
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,932
 We're family, families bicker.

705
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:57,201
                        (scoffs)
          (door opens)

706
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:00,070
           Oh, Pride,
I didn't realize you were here.

707
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,072
    I was about to call you
     with some information.

708
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,807
PRIDE:
Well, here I am.

709
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,442
        What do you got?

710
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,245
Well, I analyzed the ink
found on the bullet

711
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,847
  from Lieutenant Shaw's body.

712
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,315
           Turns out,

713
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,916
                it's tattoo ink.

714
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,918
       Special proprietary blend
               called "Chimera."

715
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,487
Sold in limited supply
and only used

716
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,355
by one shop in the area.

717
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,224
Guessing you're gonna take one
of your more experienced agents

718
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,859
to go check it out.

719
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,462
        And I'm guessing

720
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,331
    your behavior right now

721
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:31,835
              is about something
            I said in an e-mail.

722
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,504
                    Out with it!

723
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:37,875
   You told the director of NCIS
        that I was inexperienced

724
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:40,110
       and that you're unsure of
        my ability in the field.

725
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,813
         That's right.
 Because you are inexperienced,

726
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,115
 Sebastian. And you haven't been
     out in the field that much,

727
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,217
  but you know what else I said?

728
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,953
     I'd be willing to bet
  you'd make a fantastic agent

729
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,289
              if given a chance.
                  SEBASTIAN: Oh.

730
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,092
  Well, I-I guess they didn't
  send the whole e-mail then.

731
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,160
            Exactly.

732
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,162
               So, now you know.

733
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,130
             May we please go to
              the tattoo parlor?

734
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,298
             Yeah.

735
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:09,073
      (tattoo gun buzzing)

736
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,874
    Chimera ink? Yeah, I think I
   bought some a few months ago.

737
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:12,409
      Up sell it to the tourists
               when they want to

738
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,911
             bring a part of New
         Orleans home with them.

739
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,145
      Barely ever use it.

740
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,413
    Can we see your supply?

741
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,282
          (chuckling):
              Why?

742
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,150
It's in connection
with an ongoing investigation.

743
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,119
It's somewhere in the back room,
you know, I don't really have...

744
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:23,053
        Oh, don't worry,
    I-I can go check it out.

745
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,377
             Wait, hold on, man.

746
00:30:24,378 --> 00:30:25,700
I got it organized in a very
particular way, all right?

747
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,023
             I'll just show you.
Okay, all right,

748
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:29,426
 look, I still have a few more
    questions for you first.

749
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:30,928
      Sebastian, go ahead.

750
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,597
You ever seen this man?

751
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,970
           SEBASTIAN:
       This is organized?

752
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,077
    Oh, hey, man, I'm sorry.

753
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,378
       I-I didn't realize
        you were there.

754
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,947
Yeah, no worries, man.

755
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:51,114
         Catching some Z's, huh?

756
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:52,115
          Rough night?

757
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,117
      You could say that.

758
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,485
         Uh, any chance
     that you could help me

759
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,254
       find the Chimera?

760
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,555
The what now?

761
00:30:58,557 --> 00:30:59,890
            The ink.

762
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,125
     Oh, right. Yeah, sure.

763
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:04,228
            Chimera.
                           Yeah.

764
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,896
    I'll help you look.
                           Okay.

765
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:11,001
   I imagine, uh, most people
   get tattoos at night, huh?

766
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:13,237
      It's not often you wake up
      first thing in the morning

767
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,138
      and saying, "Hey, I want a
      naked lady riding a dragon

768
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,306
       across my chest."

769
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,408
                    Yeah, sounds
                    about right.

770
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,383
Looking for this, right?

771
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,252
                Uh, yeah. That's
               great, thank you.

772
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,953
I'm just gonna ask you
to move out of my way...

773
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:31,889
          Yeah, I can't do that.
Okay.

774
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,390
It's not really a request.
See, I'm a Federal Agent.

775
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,225
        (both grunting)

776
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,102
           Sebastian!

777
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,169
                  You all right?

778
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:47,304
I think it was the killer.

779
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,039
He got a gun,
he went out the back.

780
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,314
           GREGORIO:
           <i> Pulled DNA</i>

781
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:58,515
from the tattoo parlor,

782
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,651
identified our suspect
as Damon Yang.

783
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:03,620
He's affiliated with
the Seven Eagles Triad.

784
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,989
They're based in Shanghai
and San Francisco,

785
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,058
where Damon is
from originally.

786
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,260
         Looks like he's been in
New Orleans the past few months.

787
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,996
      Holing up at a tattoo shop
                and Triad front.

788
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,998
The manager of the shop's
not affiliated.

789
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,200
Knows nothing about
Seven Eagles business.

790
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,503
That's because there is no
Seven Eagles business.

791
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,271
                  The FBI busted
                 them last year.

792
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,006
        Shut down their
       entire leadership.

793
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,542
   Including Damon's father,
          Derek Yang.

794
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,412
  PRIDE: What's the connection
 between Damon and Ethan Beck?

795
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,480
              There doesn't seem
                      to be one.

796
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:34,384
  Except for the fact that he
  specializes in cyber crimes,

797
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:37,421
        identity theft,
       credit card fraud.

798
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,289
       He was prodigious.

799
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,391
                     And look at
                   his neck tat.

800
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,294
              438.

801
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:48,031
    Triads use numeric codes
  to distinguish their ranks.

802
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,499
          Mean something to you?

803
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,601
Well, I was looking through
the Collective message boards

804
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,503
for other suspects.

805
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:56,039
         There was someone whose
               handle was "438."

806
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,607
Thinking Damon was
a Collective member, too?

807
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:00,110
Maybe he joined up to get close
         to Ethan Beck.

808
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:01,611
            They worked together
                    on breaching

809
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,246
        the Federal server farm.

810
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,349
        Then he kills Beck after
          the files were stolen?

811
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,050
              What was he after?

812
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,986
      Elvis is working on
       Ethan's computer,

813
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,354
        downloading all
       the stolen files.

814
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:11,655
     Should check with him.

815
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,590
    Keep digging into Damon.

816
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:16,259
        We find out what
   he was after, we find him.

817
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,396
                       And, hey.

818
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:22,499
No matter what any e-mails say,

819
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,001
      we're a team first.

820
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,136
   We got each other's backs,
             right?

821
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:28,238
                     Yeah.
          Totally.

822
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,473
We're good, King.

823
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:32,209
Got to work on that enthusiasm.

824
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,483
   How you doing here, Elvis?

825
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:40,751
                     I'm pissed.

826
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:42,652
               I mean, Ethan was
               a son of a bitch.

827
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,454
                He was arrogant,
                he was entitled,

828
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,357
       he thought he could start
   world anarchy all by himself.

829
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,726
          But he did not deserve
                to die this way.

830
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,029
I mean, it's humiliating.
     Ethan made his own choices.

831
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,764
              That's not on you.
No?

832
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:55,432
                 When I met him,

833
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,534
he was a professional
game tester, all right?

834
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:00,437
I'm the one that put all those
ideas into his head.
                           Okay.

835
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,638
     Then let's find his killer.

836
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,173
          What have you learned?

837
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,474
Not much.

838
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,410
I gave his computer
a full cavity search.

839
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:09,746
             I found hundreds of
  thousands of classified files.

840
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,314
But I wouldn't even
know where to start.

841
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,483
    O-Okay. Sit down, Elvis.

842
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:17,821
Let's start
with, uh, Damon Yang.

843
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,589
Seven Eagles Triad member,

844
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:22,292
            probably responsible
           for all five murders.

845
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:24,327
  I got nothing on Damon Yang.

846
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:26,630
      But there is a Derek Yang.

847
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,298
        Damon's father.

848
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,533
      Former Triad leader.

849
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:32,202
        He was arrested
     and is awaiting trial.

850
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,537
     Yes, he was arrested.

851
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,306
                   But there was
               no trial, Dwayne.

852
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,208
   These are different files
      that I'm looking at.

853
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,277
Triple encrypted, super secure.

854
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,446
Of course Ethan broke the code.

855
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,114
      That's probably why
       Damon needed him.

856
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,315
What do the files say?

857
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,850
       It says that, uh,
         Derek had ties

858
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:50,187
      to some pretty nasty
radical groups in Central Asia.

859
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:53,123
         So the CIA decided that
   he could be a valuable asset.

860
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:55,592
 And they whisked him out of the
  country before the indictment.

861
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,561
    Extraordinary Rendition.

862
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:59,129
                     Does it say
             where he was taken?

863
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:00,597
     No, it's a black site.

864
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,166
       But they do give the name
    of the clandestine operative

865
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:04,534
          that interrogated him.

866
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,702
                          PRIDE:
                  Jordan Harper.

867
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,738
 Yeah, and he lives in a cabin

868
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,841
                in the middle of
             nowhere, Louisiana.

869
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:12,843
Damon's going after Harper
to find his father.

870
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:15,378
Right, and he's got a head start
  on you, so you better hurry.

871
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,716
       Harper's still not
      answering his phone.

872
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:22,285
Any word from the state troopers
  we sent to check up on him?

873
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,321
They aren't picking up,
either.

874
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:25,555
This isn't good.

875
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,424
                Damon Yang could
               be there already.

876
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:28,592
             PRIDE:
  But Damon needs Harper alive

877
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,327
to tell him where his father is.

878
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,728
         So it gives us
       a fighting chance.

879
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,363
Cabin's 50 minutes up this road.

880
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:34,865
   We're running out of time.

881
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,566
            Yeah, but if we take
      the ATV through the woods,

882
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,401
 we'll be there in less than 30.
                    Let's do it.

883
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,390
       You're good to go.
        (engine starts)

884
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,692
         (engine revs)

885
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,262
          Let's roll.

886
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:27,384
                        LASALLE:
             Two dead, troopers.

887
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,924
I see Harper.
No sign of Damon.

888
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:35,692
               Well, he's got to
              be here somewhere.

889
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,961
Let's move.

890
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:41,698
        (Lasalle grunts)

891
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,344
          Damon Yang!

892
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,880
             NCIS!
    You got nowhere to run!

893
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,349
       Then I guess we'll
     all die here together!

894
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,333
         Damon, listen,

895
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:18,501
    we all want to end this
          peacefully.

896
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:21,271
 Look, no one has to get hurt.
   Just put down your weapon,

897
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,772
    and let us have Harper.

898
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,808
         You want him?
       Come and get him.

899
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:45,629
       Where you guys at?
  Ten minutes out. What's up?

900
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,430
       We're pinned down
     and we're taking fire.

901
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,699
       Damon's got Harper
    barricaded in the cabin.

902
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,836
       We need a way in.
   SEBASTIAN: That cabin is a
   survivalist's dream house.

903
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:55,572
Walls are fortified, electricity
   and security system run on

904
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:57,440
             their own dedicated
           network off the grid.

905
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,376
 I mean, if he doesn't want you
   in, you're not getting in.

906
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,978
     Maybe, but maybe not.
    Give me something, guys!

907
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,014
I'm say we do to that cabin
what Ethan Beck did to us.

908
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,849
   You're gonna hack the system?

909
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:08,585
I'm setting up a virus to infect
the cabin's dedicated network.

910
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:09,986
       That should give you guys
                about 90 seconds

911
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,454
      before the system reboots.

912
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,390
  Whatever you do, do it fast.

913
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,925
Man, it's like watching
da Vinci.
                  Again, creepy.

914
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,727
     Last chance to tell me

915
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,795
where they're keeping my father.

916
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:19,863
             ELVIS:
          Okay, guys.

917
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,698
       Here goes nothing.

918
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:24,968
            (gasps)

919
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:39,015
LASALLE:
You stay with Harper!
I'm getting Damon!

920
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:49,359
           (panting)

921
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,675
    Put the weapon down now!

922
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,444
                        LASALLE:
          No where to go, Damon.

923
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:09,546
      We got you covered!

924
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,776
           HAMILTON:
<i>Honestly, there are no excuses.</i>

925
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,845
    I made some bad choices.

926
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,146
   And I'm not proud of them.

927
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,482
     Look, Amy, I'm human.

928
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,684
      Flawed like anyone.

929
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:49,886
  But you know what else I am?
           Grateful.

930
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,989
   That I was able to provide
  valuable assistance to NCIS

931
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,557
 and put an end to this madness

932
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,526
  before anyone else got hurt.

933
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:57,594
         (TV turns off)

934
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,529
     Oh, Hamilton the hero.

935
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:01,164
         What a snake.

936
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,566
       He's gonna walk away from
     this whole thing unscathed.

937
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,502
         You think so?

938
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:08,571
 Ooh, I know that tone, Dwayne.

939
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,073
    You've gone a few rounds
        with the mayor,

940
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,041
                    haven't you?
(soft chuckle)

941
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,444
And I have a few more
rounds left to go.

942
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:15,645
                  Well, brother,

943
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,480
    if the time ever comes,

944
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:19,849
 I'd love to help you take that
  creep down a notch or three.

945
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,452
                     Until then,
                I'm out of here.

946
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,053
Leaving without
a good-bye drink?

947
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:27,023
       Oh, I raided your cabinet
    when I was planning my exit.

948
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:29,592
    What? At least come down
                        (laughs)

949
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,528
to the bar, all right?
Celebrate with the team.

950
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,431
Come on.
                   Team? Team is
          your thing, my friend.

951
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:35,899
          My thing is different.

952
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:38,134
    By the way, I'm sending your
       people a little something

953
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,570
              to remember me by.

954
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:41,738
Well, that sounds ominous.

955
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,706
              Nah.

956
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,975
        It's just my way
      of saying thank you.

957
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,212

       to erase them all

977
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:48,638
        without looking at them.

978
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,240
SEBASTIAN: I think that's
a great idea.
                           Okay.

979
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:57,847

981
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,718
Oh, yeah,
these are nice.

982
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,088
Gregorio,
that's so sweet.

983
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,123
    You think you can learn
         a lot from me?

984
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,925
Don't go getting mushy
on me, okay?

        (Sonja chuckles)

986
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:14,163
I'm guessing you receieved
Elvis' good-bye present.

987
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,232
 He must've reverse engineered
  the schadenfreude algorithm

988
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,800
       to only search out
        the good things

989
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,135
   we wrote about each other.

990
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,670
      Which I am sure far
      outnumbered the bad.

991
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:21,871
PRIDE:
All right.

992
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,873
