Still figuring out logistics.

Like, “first day at school

53
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:25,314

Any idea who the hacker was?

None. But it's our guess,

158
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:35,950
of prominent New Orleanians.

159
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:37,885
All a part of the stolen files.

160
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:39,820
And each of our subjects
are under some form

161
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:41,254
of investigation.

162
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:42,522
Internet's blowing up.

163
00:06:42,524 --> 00:06:44,056
Videos are getting thousands
of hits.

164
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:46,325
It's straight up
public humiliation.

165
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,628
Doesn't sound
like espionage to me.

166

<font color="#0CEC0C">(computer beeps)</font>

167
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:52,365
Ah, hey. It's the new guy.

168
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:54,266
I can say that,
'cause I've been here a week.

169
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:56,302
Welcome aboard, newbie.

170
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:57,570
You got something for us?

171
00:06:57,572 --> 00:06:59,605
I'd say. Found epidermis cells

172
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:02,808
at the scene that didn't
match any of our victims.

173
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,276
But they did match
a very likely suspect.

174
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:06,277
Ethan Beck.

175
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,079
<b><font color="#FF8000">PRIDE:</font></b>
Ethan Beck?

176
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:11,149
So. All right. So you've heard
of Anonymous, right?

177
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:12,484
Of course.

178
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:14,019
Okay. Well, Ethan Beck
and his people

179
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:16,153
are, like, ten times better.
And their mission

180
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:18,623
is to expose corruption
wherever it is.

181
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,090
So where do we find this guy?

182
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:21,659
Well, that's the thing.
You don't really find him.

183
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:24,829
He finds you. He's like a...
like a phantom.

184
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:28,365
I'm expecting a “but”
right about now.

185
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:31,335
But there was a failed hack
attempt on the facility

186
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:32,602
a couple weeks back...

187
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:33,803
And Patton was able
to find out

188
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:35,304
where that hack came from.

189
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:37,641
And I'm gonna send you
those details right now.

190
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:41,978
The abandoned restaurant
on Lake Pontchartrain.

191
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,581
Yeah. Actually, there's activity
on the I.P. address right now.

192
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,815
Somebody's still there.

193
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:47,017
Could be our killer.

194
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,985
Gregorio, you're with me.

195
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,464
NCIS!

196
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:03,766
Hands where we can see 'em.

197
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:05,167
Slow!

Elvis!

200
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,877
Dwayne Pride.

201
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,279
Of all the gin joints
in all the towns, and look,

202
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:19,541
you brought your little buddy
with you, too.

203
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,282
Should've guessed,

204
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,550
if we had a major hack
job, we'd run into you.

205
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:24,184
I know what you're thinking.

206
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:26,486
This looks really bad for me.

207
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:29,056
but this time I swear
I did not do it.

208
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:30,557
Right.

209
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:49,522
<b><font color="#FF8000">GREGORIO:</font></b> Hands where
I can see 'em.

210
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,758
I am having a raging bout
of déjà vu right now.

211
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,416
Dwayne, tell her
I'm not dangerous.

212
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:54,984
Last time we dealt with
you, you were armed

213
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:56,151
and almost shot a woman.

214
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,552
She's got a point, Elvis.

215
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:59,554
Out of context, unfair.

216
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,523
And that woman
sort of had it coming.

217
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:03,025
Can I cuff him, please?

218
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:04,193
Not yet, New York.

219
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:05,494
Elvis,
this restaurant

220
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:07,829
was the source of a hack attempt

221
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,764
on a Federal server farm.

222
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:13,334
A facility where four people
were killed this morning.

223
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:15,469
Right. So you think it's, uh,

224
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,372
suspicious that I'm here,

225
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:19,874
considering my past
miscommunications

226
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:21,742
with the law.

227
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,177
Um, by miscommunications,
do you mean

228
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,780
multiple felony convictions?
Then, yes.

229
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:28,215
I'm not the felon
you're looking for.

230
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:29,917
His name is Ethan Beck.

231
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:32,886
How do you know that?

232
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,421
'Cause I'm looking for him, too.

233
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:36,924
He runs a hacktivist group
called the Collective.

234
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,591
More like a terrorist
organization,

235
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:40,660
exposing people's dirty secrets.

236
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:43,329
No. The Collective was founded
to create transparency

237
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:44,931
and expose corruption.

238
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,299
Well, right now, it's exposing

239
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:48,968
prominent folks' personal lives.

240
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,803
Yeah, and that's
really pissing me off.

241
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:51,703
Why do you care?

242
00:09:51,705 --> 00:09:54,273
Because my reputation's
at stake.

243
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,909
Because he created
the Collective.

244
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:59,345
Yeah. I created it with Ethan.

245
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:00,878
He was my protégé.

246
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,214
But he let his ego
get the best of him,

247
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,816
and it's not
about the cause anymore.

248
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:07,819
It's about Ethan proving
how powerful he is.

249
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:11,823
And that's why you guys have
to let me help you find him.

250
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:14,392
Talk about ego.
We can handle this, all right?

251
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:17,261
Dwayne, you don't have any idea
who you're dealing with.

252
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:20,097
Do you? He's hard to track.
Listen.

253
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,798
He's taken down
Fortune 500 companies.

254
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,034
He's brought government agencies
to their knees.

255
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:25,802
And he's never
been caught.

256
00:10:25,804 --> 00:10:27,537
He's dangerous.

257
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,406
Elvis, Ethan Beck
murdered four people,

258
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:32,709
including a Navy Lieutenant.
We know he's dangerous.

259
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:34,177
Good point.

260
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:36,112
But you got to let me
help you find him. <font color="#0CEC0C">(phone beeping)</font>

261
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:38,247
I taught him every trick
he knows.

262
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:39,482
I am the one guy

263
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:41,417
who could track this dude down.

264
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,354
Please.

265
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:47,991
Gregorio?
Yeah?

266
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:50,326
Take Elvis back to NCIS.

267
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:52,127
Set up him up with
whatever he needs.

268
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,395
For real?

269
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:54,829
Don't look so upset.

270
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:56,631
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckles)</font>
I don't bite.

271
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:59,067

Unless you ask real nice.

272

273
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:03,205

00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:14,382
Do you...?
They got my e-mails!

277
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:15,816
All right?
Posted them online.

278
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:17,451

Uh, I have nothing to say...

284

I've got nobody, though,

285

to field questions for me,

286
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:27,660
because my press secretary's

287
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:28,861
husband made her resign.

288
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:31,064

Your point, Mr. Mayor?

294

Now, I know you think
that I'm a bad guy.

295
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:46,778
Right? That, uh...

296
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,813
I'm only interested in myself.

297
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:51,150
If history is any guide.

298
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:55,454
I'm screwed, Dwayne.
Oh, yeah. I'm done.

299
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:58,090
And there's nothing I
can do about that now,

300

but innocent people
are getting hurt.

301
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,326
Private lives
are getting exposed.

302
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:05,163
And this could be very bad
for a lot of good people.

303
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:08,166
We agree on that
much, don't we?

304
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:11,069
I can be useful to you.

305
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:13,304
I can pull strings.

306
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:16,406
I could give you access
to resources if you need them.

307
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:21,044
Whatever you need.
Just say the word.

308

Let's fix this together.

309
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:28,418
Might be something you can do.

Seriously, do I have
to give you mouth to mouth?

00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,033
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I know exactly who you are.

317
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:46,835
You're-you're a personal hero.

318
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:48,204
I hope that
doesn't sound strange.

319
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:50,305
No, no, that's not
creepy at all.

320
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:51,872
It's just, your work
is pretty much the reason

321
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:53,941
I got into computers
in the first place.

322
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,744
Okay, now I feel old,
but also a bit flattered.

323
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:57,912
Thank you.

324
00:12:57,914 --> 00:12:59,147
What are you doing here?

325
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,716
I'm trying to track
down Ethan Beck.

326
00:13:01,718 --> 00:13:03,451
Sorry, I didn't know
this is your office,

327
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:04,852
but you got a
killer setup here.

328
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:06,621
Oh, yeah, it is killer,
but it's not mine.

329
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:08,021
I don't really have
an office, per Se.

330
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:09,223
I-I'm kind of new.
Okay.

331
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:10,790
Actually, I'm very new.

332
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,593
Although,
I've also been around a lot,

333
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:14,128
so, it's all
very complicated.

334
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,097
Anyway, I'm-I'm supposed
to find Ethan Beck, too.

335
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:18,465
Okay, good.
Cop a squat.

336
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:19,500
Let's get at it.

337
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:21,368
All right.

338
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,537
Um, uh, over there's good.

339
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:25,070
That's probably good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

340
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:31,577
Now, Ethan is a hard guy
to track down, you know?

341
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:36,516
Not easy to trace, but, uh,
we got a work-around here.

342
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:39,418
We got all the Internet
traffic for the entire city.

343
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,316
Whoa, how did you--?

344
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,275
Not me,
your mayor.

345
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:44,989
He took a break from bedding
his employees to help us out.

346
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,691
Thanks to your boss.

347
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,094
So... so, if Ethan's sifting
through all these stolen files,

348
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,397
and he's posting them online,
then he's gonna need

349
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,366
a high concentration
of bandwidth, right?

350
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:55,900
Right, and Ethan
doesn't do the grunt work,

351
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,502
so one of his minions
does it for him.

352
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,271
So, if we trace
the low-hanging fruit...

353
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,505
We can trade up to the big dog.

354
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,100
That's right.

355
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:04,376
All right. Yeah!
This is fun.

356
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,842
Yeah, yeah,
eyes front. Yeah.

357
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,344
Okay.

358
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,779
I've got some heavy traffic

359
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,481
coming from a coffee shop
in The Quarter.

360
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,716
Good job, kid.
Call in the cavalry.

361
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,685
Actually, I am the cavalry.

362
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,852
Actually, I need you to help me
find the other Collectives.

363
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:17,839
Oh, okay, yeah.

364

- Let's do it.
- Yeah. Right.

365
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,291
By here, I mean of course...
Back over there. Sure.

366

I'm gonna call Lasalle.

367

Pretty much always over there.

368

Oh, this is great.

369

Mayor Hamilton's sex tape
just went wide.

373

They got him with
his press secretary.

374

No. Someone else.
A friend's wife.

I feel bad.
For Hamilton?

376

For him, the woman, anybody
who has their privacy invaded.

00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:27,804
This whole Wizard of Oz
act doesn't exactly mesh

474
00:19:27,806 --> 00:19:30,440
with a suspect willing to kill
four people in cold blood.

475
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:32,876
Well, contradiction we can try
to explain after we find him.

476
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:36,512
Please, tell me you have another
way of tracing Ethan Beck?

477
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:37,679
Not off the top of my head.

478
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:39,415
He's gone deep underground,

479
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:41,150
probably unplugging
completely.

480
00:19:41,152 --> 00:19:42,985
So we don't trace
him digitally.

481
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:44,753
Never gonna outsmart
him online, anyway.

482
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:46,588
Ooh, that hurts my feelings.

483
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,824
Focus on who he is
in the real world instead.

484
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:51,426
You're talking
about pattern of life?

485
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:53,761
Um, what is this
“pattern of life”?

486
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:55,230
Profiling technique.

487
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:57,465
We gather every detail
we know about a suspect.

488
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:58,699
What he eats,
what he wears,

489
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:00,068
kind of music he likes.

490
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,102
Especially irregularities.

491
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:02,370
Any unusual traits or habits.

492
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:03,905
Okay, where to start?

493
00:20:03,907 --> 00:20:05,907
Well, you got a guy that sits

494
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:08,342
alone at home in front
of a computer screen.

495
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:10,377
Weirdness comes
with the territory.

496
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:12,346
We put it all
into an analytical program,

497
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:14,148
and then we got a good shot
at finding him.

498
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,682
And you actually think
that'll work?

499
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:19,019
We tracked your sorry ass
not too long ago.

500
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:22,423
You know, I think if you gave
me a shot, we could become pals.

501
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:24,191
Really?
Yeah.

502
00:20:24,193 --> 00:20:26,159
We're about
to find out.

503
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:27,893
Elvis, sit with Gregorio.

needs to know about Ethan.

505
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:33,899
Okay. Got the power going.

506
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,634
The Internet's booting back up,

507
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:36,936
so all in all,
we're in business.

508
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:38,604
Good work, Sebastian.

509
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:39,839
Loretta's got something,
so, Sebastian,

510
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:41,274
you're with me.
Let's go.

511
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:43,842
Sorry, excuse me.

512
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:45,410
I'm gonna be honest.
I'm a little afraid of you.

513
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,678
Just a little?

514
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,646
You got to learn
to take a compliment.

515
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,417
Wait, what are all
these e-mails?

516
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,452
Some kind of glitch
or something?

517
00:20:53,454 --> 00:20:54,652
Those aren't your e-mails.

518
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,521
That Ethan sure works fast.

519
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:57,589
Works fast at what?

520
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,125
At-at creating chaos.

521
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,760
Yo, the Internet's back up.

522
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,062
I know.

523
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,331
I just got a crazy
amount of e-mails.

524
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,600
Yeah, me, too,
and it's not good.

525
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,470
These are ATF files
from your undercover days.

526
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,406
Whoa. Are you kidding me?
How'd that happen?

527
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,240
Well, I'm assuming
it's Ethan Beck

528
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,575
making good on his threat.

529
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:21,478
Well, you need
to get rid of those.

530
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,079
Yeah, I'm all over it.

531
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,381
Hey, and you might
want to do the same

532
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,681
with whatever's
in your inbox.

533
00:21:25,683 --> 00:21:27,517

535
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:37,126

536
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:38,494
Oh, boy.

537
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:39,495
What'd you get?

538
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:40,896
Just an e-mail from you to Pride

539
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:43,432
saying that you don't think
I should be added to the team.

540
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:45,501
Your undercover identity
was just exposed

541
00:21:45,503 --> 00:21:46,968
and you're pissed
about an e-mail

542
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,237
taken completely out of context?

543
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:50,638
Oh, by all means,
give me the context.

544
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,073
Well, I didn't know you yet,
and couldn't tell

545
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,908
how you would mix
with the team dynamic.

546
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,344
I took a bullet for the team.
How's that for dynamic?

547
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:58,879
And you proved yourself
a hundred times since, to me.

548
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:01,382
And me to you, right?

549
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:02,983
We should probably
stop reading these

550
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:04,652
before someone else gets hurt.

551
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:16,796
Well, since Sebastian's busy
waging cyber-warfare,

552
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:18,731
I had another tech
analyze the bullets

553
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,600
from Lieutenant Shaw's murder.

554
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:22,135
Well, those slugs
were in fragments.

555
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:23,903
You were able to get
a ballistics match?

556
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:26,238
No, something
far more intriguing:

557
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,941
traces of ink.

558
00:22:28,943 --> 00:22:30,476
Ink? What kind of ink?

559
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:31,677
Printer, pen? I mean, there's

560
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,179
literally hundreds
of classifications.

561
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:35,514
I don't know, Sebastian,
but the sample was so small,

562
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:37,416
I wouldn't want anyone
to touch it, except you.

563
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:38,750
That's a good call.

564
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:41,019
Capillary electrophoresis
is not for the faint of heart.

565
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:45,690
This Ethan Beck is proving to be
as elusive as he is dangerous.

566
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:47,592
He threw us all
for a loop.

567
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:50,328
And I've never seen Elvis
afraid of anyone.

568
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,231
Worried Beck will come back,
guns blazing.

because of Ethan Beck.

No need to wait, which
should come as a relief to you,

00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:20,723
Do you know what
surveillance entails?

630
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:22,225
And I cleared you
both anyways, so...

631
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:23,726
Oh, I feel so much better.

632
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:25,961
Good! 'Cause now we can
talk about what I got.

633
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:26,762
What about what we...?

634
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:28,364
Enough!

635
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:30,199
You understand

636
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:31,899
this is exactly
what Ethan Beck wants.

637
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:33,568
Throw us off our game,
confuse us.

638
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,870
So he can get away.
You gonna let that happen?

639
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:37,205
It's called Shadenfreude.

640
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:38,640
I'll say.

641
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:40,074
It's an algorithm
I created years ago

642
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:41,443
to go after mouthy CEOs.

643
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:43,911
It culls e-mails,

644
00:25:43,913 --> 00:25:45,980
looking for sensitive
information about coworkers.

645
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:48,315
And I created it to
expose corruption.

646
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:50,016
But Ethan has used it
on you guys.

647
00:25:50,018 --> 00:25:52,119
Any progress locating him?

648
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:54,154
We aggregated every detail
we can find

649
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:56,990
on Ethan Beck's personal habits
and idisyncrasies.

650
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,992
There's a lot.
He's afraid of heights,

651
00:25:58,994 --> 00:26:00,361
so he's not living
in a high-rise.

652
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:02,329
He's also a recovering
heroin addict,

653
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:03,930
a big believer
in the twelve steps.

654
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:05,265
Okay, so he needs
to be near meetings.

655
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:06,832

you add to that,

656
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,368
the paranoia that goes
with the territory,

657
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,202
going after the
very powerful.

658
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:11,404
He likes mobility,

659
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:13,406
has to be able to escape
at a moment's notice.

660
00:26:13,408 --> 00:26:14,707
Okay, well around here,

661
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:16,576
water's the fastest
way out, so, a boat.

662
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:19,545
Okay, how do we narrow it
further?

664

Ethan is obsessed
with wood oven pizza.

665
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:29,354
And he has to have it delivered
at all hours.

Pride, you need to see this!

Suicide note.

677
00:27:31,614 --> 00:27:32,880
This guy's in the
middle of a crusade,

678
00:27:32,882 --> 00:27:34,449
exposing people
left and right

679
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:35,683
and just offs himself?

680
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:37,284
Does that seem right to you?

681
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:41,556
Nothing about this seems right.

682
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:03,951
Ethan Beck had
a hundred milligrams

683
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:06,385
of nearly pure heroin
in his bloodstream.

684

No one would have been able
to inject that much.

685
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:11,858
He would have passed out
before completing the dose.

686
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,359
This man was murdered.

687
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:15,929
Yet someone wants us to think
he committed suicide.

688
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:18,164
You think he had an accomplice?

689
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,633
Beck may have released
confidential files

690
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:22,234
and videos on
the Internet,

691
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:23,702
thrown my team
into disarray

692
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:24,937
by hacking our e-mails,

693
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:27,640
but breaching a
federal facility?

694
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:29,574
And expertly killing
four people?

695
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:33,012
Yeah, Mr. Beck was not
in the pink of health.

696
00:28:33,014 --> 00:28:35,580
He would have gotten winded
answering the front door,

697
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:37,081
let alone storming
the gates.

698
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,549
Well then, what?

699
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,986
Someone planted Ethan's DNA
at our crime scene?

700
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,888
Set him up to
take the fall?

701
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,356
Why go to all that trouble?

702
00:28:45,358 --> 00:28:48,626
Elvis and the rest of the team

each other's throats again.

Mm.
Still dissention in the ranks?

707
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,502
Honestly, I'm surprised
how little it took

708
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,937
to throw us off our game.

What do you got?

Well, I analyzed the ink
found on the bullet

from Lieutenant Shaw's body.

Turns out,

it's tattoo ink.

720
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:24,393
Special proprietary blend
called “Chimera”"

721

Sold in limited supply
and only used

722

by one shop in the area.

723
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:29,831

of your more experienced agents

724
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,432
to go check it out.

725
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:35,103
And I'm guessing

726
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:36,871
your behavior right now

727
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:41,342
is about something
I said in an e-mail.

728
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,111
Out with it!

729
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:47,314
You told the director of NCIS
that I was inexperienced

730
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:49,549
and that you're unsure of
my ability in the field.

731
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:52,186
That's right.
Because you are inexperienced,

732
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:54,654
Sebastian. And you haven't been
out in the field that much,

733
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:56,690
but you know what else I said?

734
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:59,359
I'd be willing to bet
you'd make a fantastic agent

Seven Eagles business.

That's because there is no

identity theft,
credit card fraud.

Maybe he joined up to get close

I'm pissed.

832
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,978
I mean, Ethan was
a son of a bitch.

833
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,646
He was arrogant,
he was entitled,

834
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:56,549
he thought he could start
world anarchy all by himself.

835
00:33:56,551 --> 00:33:59,017
But he did not deserve
to die this way.

836
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:01,153
I mean, it's humiliating.
Ethan made his own choices.

837
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:03,088
That's not on you.
No?

838
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,689
When I met him,

839
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:06,758
he was a professional
game tester, all right?

840
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,879
I'm the one that put all those
ideas into his head.

841
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:09,695
Okay.

842
00:34:09,696 --> 00:34:10,929
Then let's find his killer.

843
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:12,397
What have you learned?

844
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,731
Not much.

845
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:15,600
I gave his computer
a full cavity search.

846
00:34:15,602 --> 00:34:19,070
I found hundreds of
thousands of classified files.

847
00:34:19,072 --> 00:34:20,571
But I wouldn't even
know where to start.

848
00:34:20,573 --> 00:34:22,739
O-Okay. Sit down, Elvis.

849
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:27,211
Let's start
with, uh, Damon Yang.

850
00:34:27,213 --> 00:34:28,846
Seven Eagles Triad member,

851
00:34:28,848 --> 00:34:31,515
probably responsible
for all five murders.

852
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:33,649
I got nothing on Damon Yang.

853
00:34:34,752 --> 00:34:35,952
But there is a Derek Yang.

854
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:37,520
Damon's father.

855
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:38,754
Former Triad leader.

856
00:34:38,756 --> 00:34:41,391
He was arrested
and is awaiting trial.

857
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:42,725
Yes, he was arrested.

858
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:45,462
But there was
no trial, Dwayne.

859
00:34:45,464 --> 00:34:47,430
These are different files
that I'm looking at.

860
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:49,499
Triple encrypted, super secure.

861
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:51,566
Of course Ethan broke the code.

862
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:53,235
That's probably why
Damon needed him.

863
00:34:53,237 --> 00:34:54,403
What do the files say?

864
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:56,105
It says that, uh,
Derek had ties

865
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:59,241
to some pretty nasty
radical groups in Central Asia.

866
00:34:59,243 --> 00:35:02,144
So the CIA decided that
he could be a valuable asset.

867
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:04,846
And they whisked him out of the
country before the indictment.

868
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:06,715
Extraordinary Rendition.

869
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:08,216
Does it say
where he was taken?

870
00:35:08,218 --> 00:35:09,783
No, it's a black site.

871
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:12,253
But they do give the name
of the clandestine operative

872
00:35:12,255 --> 00:35:13,654
