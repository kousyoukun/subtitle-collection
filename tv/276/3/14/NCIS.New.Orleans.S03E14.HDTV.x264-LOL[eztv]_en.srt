Suspect was covered in blood,
armed with this.

43
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:05,879
Claimed he was NCIS,
but no credentials.

44
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:07,781
Said he was working
undercover.

45
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:10,150
I had to take him
into custody.

46
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:11,518
Is he one of yours?

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,086
So they tell me.

48
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:15,555
You did the right
thing, Pete. Thanks.

49
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:16,723
Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,893
Pride.

51
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:21,528
We met over MTAC.

52
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,962
Nick Torres.

53
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:25,365
You make quite a first
impression, Nick Torres.

54
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:28,234
Less than two hours in my city,
and you get yourself arrested

55
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:30,403
as a suspected murderer.

56
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:33,139
That's got to be
some kind of record.

57
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:35,975
I got an explanation.

58
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:37,644
Yeah, you and
Special Agent McGee

59
00:02:37,646 --> 00:02:40,046
were sent to New Orleans
to recover stolen Intel, yes?

60
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:42,015
Yes. It's called
the Playbook.

61
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:43,316
It's a collection of scenarios

62
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:44,918
for viable terrorist attacks
against the U.S.

63
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,321
Stolen from Homeland Security.
I... That much I know.

64
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:50,957
What I don't know is why
you ran an operation

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,026
without checking
in first.

66
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:55,395
Tracking down a former contact
of my undercover days.

67
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:56,629
That would be the murder victim.

68
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:59,065
Ferdinand Pisco.
Venezuelan operative.

69
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,534
Uh, he's in town
to acquire the Playbook.

70
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:03,570
Had to handle it, um...

71
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:05,004
delicately.

72
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:06,639
Ah.

73
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,309
That word must have a
different meaning up in D.C.

74
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,145
But down here, in
New Orleans, at Mardi Gras,

75
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:14,948
NCIS likes to keep
a lower profile.

76
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,484
Pride, I was supposed
to check in. That's on me.

77
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:19,719
But all I did
was follow the guy.

78
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:22,388
Someone else killed him.

79
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,690
Probably to make sure

80
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:25,558
Ferdinand didn't
get the Playbook.

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,693
Probably.

82
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:27,827
Mm-hmm.

83
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,763
We have to find out who.

84
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,066
And here's
a silly question-- um...

85
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:35,735
you think you could take these,
uh, handcuffs off me now?

86
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:37,837
Haven't decided yet.

87
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,606
Pride, I'm telling you,

88
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:42,275
my second impression is
so much better than the first.

89
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:45,311
One can only hope.

90
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,616
Loretta.

91
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:50,850
Dwayne.

92
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:53,786
This is not exactly
how I expected to spend

93
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,221
the weekend before Mardi Gras.

94
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:57,357
Imagine it wasn't
how Ferdinand Pisco

95
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,392
expected it
would go either.

96
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:01,961
I don't think he even realized
he was injured

97
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:03,062
until it was too late.

98
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:05,431
It's a single stab wound,
as far as I can tell.

99
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,400
Maximum damage in minimum time.

100
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:09,068
- Anything on the killer?
- Oh, yeah.

101
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,837
Spoke to multiple witnesses

102
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:12,372
who positively I.D.'d
the suspect.

103
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:15,375
Unfortunately,
they all described him.

104
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:19,379
Nick Torres. How you doing?

105
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:21,414
I'm Gregorio.
I'd be better if you had more

106
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,117
on the murder suspect than just
“wearing a harlequin costume.”

107
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,552
So embarrassing.
I had no idea

108
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:27,187
that was a common
fashion statement here.

109
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,621
Krewe of Commedia.

110
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:29,856
They had their
annual party here.

111
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,658
Uh, crew of what now?

112
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,960
It's a New Orleans thing
I'm still not clear on.

113
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:35,395
It means there were
over a hundred Harlequins

114
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:36,629
dressed like that last night.

115
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:39,299
NOPD's interviewing as many
as they can round up.

116
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,968
Anyone who can kill like this
had an escape route--

117
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,636
long gone.

118
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:45,972
Oh, man, that's so gross.

119
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:47,540
What you got there, Sebastian?

120
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,943
Victim's cell phone.
And probably a case of hep C,

121
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:51,511
considering this gutter
I just pulled it out of.

122
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:52,912
I'm gonna need to go home
and take, like,

123
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:54,380
a long Silkwood shower.

124
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:57,383
Looks water damaged.
Can you retrieve the data?

125
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,285
Oh, yeah, I'm on it.

126
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,653
Gregorio,

127
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:02,021
check surveillance.
We need something more

128
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:04,390
on our killer
other than he looks like

129
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:05,491
Torres here.

130
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:07,660
Mm-hmm.
So, Ferdinand

131
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:10,263
was here to meet up with
whoever stole the Playbook.

132
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:11,998
Any update on who that might be?

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,733
That would be
McGee's department.

134
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:16,002
Where's McGee?

135
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:18,271
It is absolutely crazy
out there.

136
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:21,074
Agent McGee,
finally in New Orleans.

137
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:22,175
How you doing?

138
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:23,843
And your first Mardi Gras
in the quarter.

139
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:26,279
I see you've already caught on
to the New Orleans vibe.

140
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:27,914
Day drinking is step one.

141
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,115
I-I am not day drinking.

142
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,483
Someone forced this
into my hand.

143
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:32,252
Yeah, if you say so,
glitter boo.

144
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,537
I do, uh, come
bearing gifts, however.

145
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:35,335
Can I use your computer?

146
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,303
Absolutely.

147
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:39,672
Been tracking the digital trail
of whoever stole the Playbook

148
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,307
in the first place.

149
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,342
They've been making some
moves the last couple days.

150
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,977
Yeah? What kind of moves?

151
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,379
NSA's had an uptick in their
chatter about the Playbook.

152
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,582
Thief is putting it
up for auction.

153
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:50,916
It's going to the
highest bidder.

154
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,885
So multiple bad actors

155
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:55,754
from all over the globe
trying to make a bid.

156
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,122
Timothy McGee.

157
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,091
Make yourself at home.
Hey.

158
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,326
How are you?
Good.

159
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,493
Morning.

160
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,494
So, New Orleans at Mardi Gras

161
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,463
is perfect
for an auction like this.

162
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,698
Million visitors
in the city,

163
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,132
half of them in masks.

164
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,435
Easy to slip in and out
without being seen.

165
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:10,870
Well, then let's
hit the streets.

166
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,571
Let's get that Playbook back.

167
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:16,041
Uh, you're not hitting anything
after last night.

168
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,611
Hey, I took initiative to
contact Ferdinand Pisco.

169
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,279
I'm not the reason the
operation went sour.

170
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:22,381
I'm not the one
you need to convince.

171
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,816
Hey, boss.

172
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,651
Yeah.

173
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,553
He's right here.

174
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,755
Actually, he wants
to talk to Pride.

175
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,925
Are you holding up okay, Dwayne?

176
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,360
Wish Homeland's mess

177
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:36,495
hadn't ended up in our backyard,
but we'll deal with it.

178
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,497
Got backup available
if you want it.

179
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,965
More agents means
more questions.

180
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,934
I want to keep this contained.

181
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:44,470
That's gonna be hard to do.
We've got a rogue's gallery

182
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,705
of international operatives
descending on New Orleans.

183
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,207
Every agency in D.C. wants in.

184
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,675
I just got through

185
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:52,278
hand-holding the FBI on
the Javier Garcia case.

186
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,579
Don't need a sequel.

187
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,314
Roger that.
I'll run interference.

188
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:56,715
Appreciate it, Jethro.

189
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,385
You always had a gentler
way with the suits.

190
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,856
Sorry, that wasn't a joke?

191
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,391
Send Torres in.

192
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:06,992
We need to talk.

193
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,027
You got it, boss.

194
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,762
McGee.
Yeah, boss?

195
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,163
What is that around your neck?

196
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,333
Oh, uh, they're beads.
It's a festive thing.

197
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,101
Trying to get
into the--

198
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,636
Never mind.

199
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,972
Wrong door.

200
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,213
So I was able to retrieve data

201
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,134
off of Ferdinand Pisco's
busted cell phone.

202
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:31,791
- What'd you get?
- Texts.

203
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,365
He was, uh, communicating
with whoever stole the Playbook.

204
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,493
They were supposed to meet
in the Quarter.

205
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:38,461
Yeah, someone killed Pisco
before the meeting took place.

206
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:40,330
Well, able to get us
anything on Pisco

207
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:42,065
or the thief from the texts?
No.

208
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,634
But I was able to trace the
serial number from the phone,

209
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:46,669
and it was one of
five burner phones

210
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:49,839
purchased together at
an airport kiosk a few days ago.

211
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,535
Five phones
can mean five buyers.

212
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,677
All we have to do is track the phones,
and we find all the buyers.

213
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,312
Tracking the phones
isn't that easy.

214
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:59,115
Can't you just trace the ping
from the cellular towers

215
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:00,783
and triangulate or whatever?

216
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:02,919
No, it's-it's
2017 now, Sonja.

217
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:04,821
The era of the ping
is long gone.

218
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,890
Even cheap burner phones
are GPS enabled.

219
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:09,392
You know, the real
GPS tracking expert is Patton,

220
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:12,662
and he's off consulting JSOC
on some online security issue.

221
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:14,864
Hey, you know, uh,
I don't mean to brag,

222
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,500
but I wrote an algorithm that
is kind of a game changer

223
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:19,102
in satellite circles.

224
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:20,803
- Geez.
- You're...

225
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:23,640
you're, uh...
you're McGee, right?

226
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:25,074
Uh, yeah, yeah.

227
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:27,277
Yeah. I'm Sebastian.
I-I've heard so much about you.

228
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,945
Oh, you have?

229
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:31,381
Well, you went from tech support
to special agent overnight.

230
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:33,183
Sort of a legend at FLETC.

231
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:34,317
At least, you know, to me.

232
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:35,418
It-it wasn't
quite that simple.

233
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,187
But, uh, this is.
Oh.

234
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:39,155
Let me show you this.
All you need to do is

235
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:40,957
enter the serial numbers.

236
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:48,131
Whoa, this is,
this is amazing.

237
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,833
There's no way that this is,
uh, a rigid tracking algorithm.

238
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,769
No, no, no. Rigid tracking's
no good. Satellite phones

239
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:54,237
are always on the move,
so this is

240
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,573
a geosynchronous
step track processing,

241
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,758
with a little bit of
pizzazz on the side.

242
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,376
Of course.
Yeah, makes total sense.

243
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:00,677
To who?

244
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,881
Oh, wait. One of the burner
phones just powered on.

245
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:06,449
Somewhere near
Armstrong Park.

246
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,651
I'm getting the exact
coordinates now.

247
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:09,675
Nice.

248
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,199
Got a lot of tourists
and a bunch of drunks.

249
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:24,667
Not sure who
we're looking for.

250
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,636
Any clues to help us out,
Sebastian?

251
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:28,972
All I can tell you
is that whoever is using

252
00:09:28,974 --> 00:09:31,374
that burner phone
is actively texting right now.

253
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:34,711
Well, think I
see our target.

254
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:37,880
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to turn around,

255
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:39,449
put your hands in the air!

256
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:46,122
She's dead.

257
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:48,424
Stabbed just like Pisco.

258
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:50,960
It just happened.

259
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:53,563
Yeah, and whoever
did it was just here.

260
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:14,839
According to DNA,
this is Monica Grange.

261
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:17,475
U.S. citizen traveling
under a Canadian alias.

262
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:19,177
Wanted in four
different countries

263
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,212
for ties to a Syrian
terrorist group.

264
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,815
Yeah, been off the grid
for years acting as a middleman,

265
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:26,050
buying weapons, Intel,
explosives.

266
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,385
Probably in town

267
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:29,287
to bid for the Playbook,
just like Ferdinand.

268
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:30,588
And just like Ferdinand,

269
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,423
she got stabbed before
she could make contact

270
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,058
with whoever the seller is.

271
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,061
Two operatives in town
murdered within a day.

272
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:39,564
Killer could be another buyer
taking out the competition.

273
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:42,433
Easier to negotiate
if everyone else is dead.

274
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:44,402
Well, Sebastian and McGee
are tracking down

275
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:46,471
the remaining burner
phones and buyers.

276
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:49,140
Well, as for
our killer, all we got is

277
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:52,477
footage of the suspect
running away last night.

278
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:55,213
So how do we get
the Playbook back?

279
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,581
Talk to me.

280
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,816
Monica Grange was corresponding
with the killer before she died.

281
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:00,118
They were supposed
to meet tonight.

282
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,419
We have
Monica's phone.

283
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:03,354
I have a clean identity.
Set up a meet.

284
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:04,922
I'll go in
in her place.

285
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:06,657
Seller's proven to be careful--
not gonna have

286
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,359
the Playbook on him
at the meeting.

287
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:11,496
Anyone but a woman shows up,
seller could spook.

288
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:13,064
Well, what if I go in as Monica?

289
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:15,900
I mean, she's been off the grid,
no current photo.

290
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:17,969
Seller will have no idea.

291
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,303
Seller will have every idea.

292
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,105
I'm sorry, but you reek of cop.

293
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:22,974
You trying to say I smell?
No, I'm saying

294
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,876
that undercover work
takes a certain flair.

295
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:27,178
Like the flair you had last
night when you got arrested?

296
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,579
Oh, really? We're gonna do that?

297
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:29,947
Look, all I'm trying
to say is

298
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:32,083
if we want to get
the Playbook back <i>quietly,</i>

299
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,484
then I'm your girl.

300
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:34,952
Gregorio's right.

301
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,487
Study up on Monica Grange

302
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:37,989
until the seller
reaches out.

303
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:40,091
I got to go to autopsy.

304
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:45,430
What'd you find, Loretta?

305
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:48,099
Frightful
symmetry, I'm afraid.

306
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:51,702
Both victims killed with a
single stab between the ribs...

307
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,440
...puncturing the heart,
bled out within moments.

308
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:57,175
Probably didn't even realize
they were stabbed

309
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,476
before it was too late.

310
00:11:58,478 --> 00:11:59,477
The weapon was thin-bladed.

311
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,212
Stiletto, most likely.

312
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:03,881
Killer's a skilled expert who
can slip in and out of a crowd

313
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:05,950
without being noticed.
Yeah, no sign of fibers,

314
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:07,452
DNA, fingerprints.

315
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:08,853
Trained intelligence agent?

316
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:10,188
Or an assassin.

317
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,557
Whoever the killer is,
we need to contain him now.

318
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,592
A highly skilled assassin

319
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:17,195
roaming the streets
of New Orleans at Mardi Gras.

320
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:18,863
Dwayne.

321
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,033
Maybe it's time
to call in the cavalry.

322
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:24,268
Well, if we do that, it won't
just be the FBI coming.

323
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,504
Be CIA, too.
Yeah, and those guys suck.

324
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:28,272
Yeah, it'll be like
the Wild West.

325
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:31,576
Can't let that happen.
Sebastian,

326
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:33,044
tell me you got
good news.

327
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:35,279
McGee and I were able to hack
the last three burner phones.

328
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,081
Means we can track
their locations.

329
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,749
Yeah, well,
we can do better than that.

330
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:40,318
We're gonna draw
the buyers to us.

331
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,920
Send them text messages,
pretending to be the seller,

332
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:46,290
then sweep them up--
classic false flag operation.

333
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,359
And what does that mean,
exactly?

334
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,927
I have no idea--
something that McGee said.

335
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:51,295
But it sounds really cool,
right?

336
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:53,397
Chris, Sonja,

337
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,766
help McGee and Sebastian
bring in the buyers.

338
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:58,569
And remember, any one of them
could be our killer.

339
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:00,338
Need you to proceed
with caution.

340
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,173
You got it.

341
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:04,342
That's the entirety

342
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,877
of Interpol's file
on Monica Grange.

343
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,245
It's barely a page long.

344
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,579
It'll have to do.

345
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:10,348
She's a lawyer
by profession,

346
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,283
so you're gonna have to pretend
like you understand law.

347
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:13,584
Don't need to pretend.

348
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:16,654
I am a lawyer; went to law
school before joining the FBI.

349
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:19,090
She's fluent in Arabic.

350
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:21,359
I'm assuming you're not.

351
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,227
No, but I dated

352
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:26,497
an Egyptian once
and learned a phrase or two.

353
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,132
You know, you're pretty cocky

354
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:30,101
for someone that's
never worked undercover before.

355
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:32,169
Oh, I've worked
undercover ops before.

356
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:34,805
Yeah, well, I'm not talking
about a couple of days

357
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:36,474
of playing make-believe,

358
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:39,110
take down a drug dealer.

359
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,545
I'm talking about

360
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:43,848
spending years
being another person.

361
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,585
So long that you...

362
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:49,320
you forget who you really are.

363
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:51,222
Fascinating.

364
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:54,392
But all I need is an hour or two
to get the Playbook back, so...

365
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:56,294
And all you need
is to screw up once,

366
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:58,262
and this entire situation
goes pear-shaped.

367
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,531
You know, I may not
be fluent in Arabic,

368
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,400
but I am fluent
in body language,

369
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:05,403
and it's killing you
to ride the bench.

370
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:08,472
It's killing me
to ride the bench.

371
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,677
You know, I'm not a bench guy;
I'm an on-the-field kind of guy.

372
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,145
Not much of a
team player, huh?

373
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,681
No, this, uh...

374
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:19,317
team thing
has been pretty recent.

375
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:20,384
It's an adjustment.

376
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:22,353
I get it. It's not easy
being the new guy

377
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:23,888
with a group that's
worked so long together.

378
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,656
Yeah, I mean,
inside jokes alone...

379
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:27,558
Yeah, and you're never
fully confident that

380
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,027
they actually need you, right?
It's, like, what am I doing?

381
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:31,462
Exactly.

382
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:32,897
Well, I'm gonna need you,
Torres,

383
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,699
'cause I have
no idea what I'm doing.

384
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:36,334
So let's just start there,
all right?

385
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:42,173
It's the seller.

386
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,307
Meeting's at 8:00.

387
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:44,575
Sazerac Bar.

388
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,344
I'll let Pride know.

389
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,856
Not gonna want
to do that, Sebastian.

390
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:01,092
Keep your eyes forward
or on me.

391
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:02,994
Well, how-how will we know
when the target's here?

392
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:04,128
Window reflections.

393
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,530
Got a security
mirror up there.

394
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,867
There's about five other ways to
know what's going on behind us.

395
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,103
What, I still got glitter
in my hair?

396
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,104
No.

397
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:14,805
Well, yeah, but that's not it.

398
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:16,874
You're a nerd
like me, you know?

399
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:18,943
But you're, like,
this badass nerd.

400
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:20,645
You're so good at this.

401
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:22,313
Eh. Just have more experience.

402
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:23,948
No, you-you make it look easy.

403
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,050
I just keep
messing up.

404
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,485
Look...

405
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,554
when I was a probie,
I messed up all the time.

406
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,156
Okay? I made a ton
of mistakes.

407
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:34,191
But I was fortunate;
I had some key mentors

408
00:15:34,193 --> 00:15:35,826
that showed me the ropes.

409
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:38,129
Well, they must have been very
patient and forgiving, then.

410
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:39,730
They were merciless.
Downright mean sometimes.

411
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:41,132
But you know what?

412
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:43,467
They always had my six,
and I always had theirs.

413
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,005
Buyer's here.

414
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:51,375
The windbreaker,
duck boots.

415
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:52,743
All right.

416
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:55,646
All right, I'll send him out
to the alley away from everyone,

417
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:57,715
so we can pick him up there.
All right.

418
00:15:57,717 --> 00:15:59,383
All right, you zig, I zag.
What, now? What's that?

419
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:01,719
Follow him.
Okay, yeah, all right.

420
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:22,873
Hi. Uh...

421
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,275
I'm a federal agent...

422
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:29,747
Stop-stop resisting.

423
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,049
Stop resisting.
It's gonna be okay.

424
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:33,451
Just...

425
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,586
We're all gonna be fine.

426
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:45,396
What was that, like, a...
like, a Vulcan nerve pinch?

427
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:47,732
Mossad technique
an old friend of mine taught me.

428
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:50,768
All right, we got to get him
up here, get him in the car.

429
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,136
Yeah. No problem.

430
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:54,638
Okay.

431
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,507
Kind of wish we didn't
park so far away.

432
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:57,908

Easier for us
to stay hidden.

443
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:32,109
But too
crowded if there's a problem.

444
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,278
I should be in there with you.

445

Stay where you are, Torres.

- No, I did.

452
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,398
Join me?

453
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:57,935
That the seller
or just a come-on?

454
00:17:57,937 --> 00:17:59,670
She's the seller.

455
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:01,438
Eva Azarova.

456
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Russian sleeper agent.

457
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:06,544
Sort of helped us out of a mess
we were in last year.

458
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:07,912
Sort of?

459
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:09,613
She happened to be responsible
for the mess

460
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:11,816
- in the first place.
- I make it a rule

461
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:13,284
not to take drinks
from strangers.

462
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:14,819
You never know what's in it.

463
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:18,055
Mm. I don't think it's the drink
you need to worry about.

464
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:21,792
Why don't you tell me

I'm Monica Grange.

468
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:46,683
You should know that
because you invited me.

469
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:55,192
That's Arabic.

470
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:57,194
Monica's fluent.
Gregorio's not.

471
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:58,795
Counts as sideways to me, Pride.

472
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:00,397
Hold on, Torres.

473
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,852
Don't know that saying.
It's beautiful.

474
00:19:22,854 --> 00:19:24,754
What does it mean?

475
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:27,324
It means you're not
the only one who came armed.

476
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:31,728
Might have an issue, Torres.

477
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,597
Might need you
to cover the front door.

478
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,299
Let's not cause a scene.

479
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,669
Let's relax
and enjoy our drinks.

480
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:43,473
Give me some time, you'll
enjoy the company as well.

Morris, ladies and gentlemen.

00:19:53,352 --> 00:19:55,385
<i>Pride got a positive I.D.</i>

484
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:57,053
on the suspect who
stole the Playbook.

485
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,221
Good.

486
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,724
Eva Azarova?

487
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:03,526
I thought we put her away
last year for espionage.

488
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:05,295
Yeah. Guess she escaped,
somehow got the Playbook.

489
00:20:05,297 --> 00:20:06,796
Now she's trying
to sell it.

490
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,131
Gregorio's made contact.

491
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,699
Well, hopefully, she
gets the Playbook back

492
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:11,134
before anyone
else gets hurt.

493
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:12,602
Yeah. Meanwhile, we've got

494
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:14,404
two out of the three
foreign buyers in custody.

495
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:16,806
Though ours isn't talking.

496
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:18,608
Yeah, North Korean operative.

497
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,011
Just sits there like he doesn't
understand a word we're saying,

498
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,812
smiling and nodding.

499
00:20:22,814 --> 00:20:24,114
You guys have any better luck?

500
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:25,582
No. Although, oh, man,

501
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:27,117
you guys should've been
in interrogation

502
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,052
to see McGee go to work.

503
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:30,387
He did this whole
no-talking thing

504
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:31,688
that completely
freaked our guy out.

505
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,423
I mean, he ended up
telling us his entire

506
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:36,126
life story just
to get McGee to speak.

507
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:37,994
So cool.

508
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:39,262
What?

509
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:41,197
You really like McGee,
don't you?

510
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,300
Yeah, bit of a man crush,
you ask me.

511
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:45,435
It's a total
man crush, yeah.

512
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:47,937
Also, it's like looking
into a crystal ball

513
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:49,639
to see what I could
potentially become.

514
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:52,309
You know? I mean, McGee is
basically future Sebastian.

515
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:53,977
Well, where's
future Sebastian now?

516
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,713
He's in Patton's office trying
to track the final burner phone.

517
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:57,947
No luck so far, though.

518
00:20:57,949 --> 00:20:59,983
It hasn't even
been turned on.

519
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:02,419
Well, two of the other buyers
were murdered,

520
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:04,621
so maybe whoever has
the other phone is dead, too.

521
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:05,922
Or he could be

522
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:08,191
the killer, take out the
competition for the Playbook.

523
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:09,959
Well, all we know

524
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,262
about the killer is that he was
wearing a Mardi Gras costume,

525
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:14,397
and he's good with a knife.
I mean, we need more.

526
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,566
Well, that's what
I've been working on.

527
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:19,336
So, we have about ten seconds
of surveillance video

528
00:21:19,338 --> 00:21:20,837
from the night
Ferdinand Pisco was killed.

529
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,339
I'm using a special
computer program

530
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:24,240
to analyze
the suspect's gait--

531
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,809
stride length, height,
measurements.

532
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:28,378
It can even predict gender.
Is this for real?

533
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,980
I'm gonna cross-check the
results against our database,

534
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:32,849
and hopefully come up
with a viable suspect.

535
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:34,617
Yeah, well, keep at it,
Past Sebastian.

536
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:35,785
Yeah.

537
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,595
You're not at all
what I was expecting,

538
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,163

542
00:21:57,142 --> 00:21:58,708

543
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,538

544
00:21:59,562 --> 00:22:01,045
Hey, Gregorio,

545
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:03,380
you think you might bring up
the Playbook anytime soon,

546
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:05,081
or is that a like a second date

547
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,383
type of question?

548
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:07,584
Do I disappoint?

549
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:09,119
Not in the least.

550
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,387
Honestly, Pride, how long

551
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:12,021
are we gonna go on
with the foreplay?

552
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:14,157
Gregorio, you might want
to give her a push.

553
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:17,293
Well, let's talk business.

554
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,963
My employer is eager
to make an offer.

555
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:23,600
I haven't decided
if I'm entertaining an offer.

556
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:26,002
Well, what else do I have to do
to convince you?

557
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:27,604
Meet me at the elevator.

558
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:28,638
Where are we going?

559
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,673

And bring your drink.

560
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:33,410
'Cause it's the only way you're
gonna get to see the Playbook.

561
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:36,012

562

566
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:51,961
One sideways glance, Gregorio,

567
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:54,130
we shut
this whole operation down.

568
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,806
Weapon on the table, please.

569
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:05,442
You, too.

570
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:13,616
Hmm.

571
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:18,888
Penthouse.

572
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,658

Very nice.

Tenth floor,
east side of the hotel.

574
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:26,696
You say the word,
I'm on the move.

575
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:31,234
I didn't book the room
because of the view.

576
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:33,570
Balcony gives me access
to the roof.

Escape route
if I need it.

578
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:38,174
Paranoid way of life.

579
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,977
Only way to survive in our line.

580
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:42,445
Gets tiring, though.

581
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:44,013
Why do it?

582
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:46,015
I've got my reasons.

583
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:47,417
Here's the Playbook.

584
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:50,353
Voice activation security
needs my voice.

585
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:58,661
Have a look.

586
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:09,906
- Sebastian.
- Pride.

587
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,141
I just got a hit back on that
gait analysis I was running.

588
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:13,576
What's gait analysis?

589
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,178
It's too complicated
to explain right now.

590
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,947
Bottom line, we got an I.D.
on our murder suspect.

591
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:20,083
Eva Azarova came back
as a match.

592
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,484
Are you sure?

593
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:22,519
Program's not 100% accurate,

594
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:24,254
but, yeah,
I'm-I'm pretty damn sure.

595
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,288
Torres,

596
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,589
Gregorio's up there
with our killer.

597
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:27,557
I got the room.

598
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,425
You cover the back

599
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,793
in case she tries to escape.

600
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:31,928
Copy.

601
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,329
Gregorio, do you hear that?

602
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:34,864
Got confirmation
that Eva's responsible

603
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:36,466
for Ferdinand's murder.

604
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:38,635
I'm on my way, but you need
to get out of there now.

605
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:42,038
Everything seems in order.
I'll reach out to my employer...

606
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,007
I know you're not
Monica Grange,

607
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:45,842
because I watched her
die this morning.

608
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,911
I thought Victor
may have sent you

609
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:50,547
because you're
definitely his type.

610
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:54,150
I don't even know who Victor is,
but you got bigger problems

611
00:24:54,152 --> 00:24:56,719
'cause you're pointing
a knife at a federal agent.

612
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,006
Drop it!

613
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:18,274
Now!

614
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:23,246
Pride, I got the suspect
in custody.

615
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:24,881
Copy that. Almost there.

616
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:26,282
Pride?

617
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:27,584
You're NCIS.

618
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:29,018
Yeah.

619
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,587
And you're under arrest
for espionage

620
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:33,089
and the murder of Ferdinand
Pisco and Monica Grange.

621
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:35,825
Well, you got me on espionage,
but I didn't kill those people.

622
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,894
Oh, yeah? Then who did?

623
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:41,531
Same person who just did that.

624
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:56,012
You hit?
No.

625
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,013
Stay there.

626
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,648
Gregorio?

627
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,050
You okay?

628
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:02,685
Two gunmen went out the balcony.

629
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,554
They have the Playbook.

630
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:07,690
Torres, two suspects
headed your way, armed.

631
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,227
Torres, do you copy?

632
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:14,297
Agent Torres is
unable to respond.

633
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,133
Who is this?

634
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:18,568
The man you'll be
negotiating with

635
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,303
if you want
Torres back alive.

636
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:23,506
Ask Eva what happens
if you don't comply.

637
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:25,675
I'll expect your call.

638
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:47,077
Just got off the phone
with Director Vance,

639
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,846
who's ready to send the Marines
down to get Torres back.

640
00:26:49,848 --> 00:26:51,481
What do we know?
Not much.

641
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:53,350
Torres and the Playbook
were taken last night

642
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:56,119
by three gunmen in a black SUV
at the Roosevelt Hotel.

643
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:58,088
Sebastian and McGee are trying
to track the movements

644
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,757
of that SUV, but it seems like
it vanished into thin air.

645
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,593
This Victor's good at
what he does, whoever he is.

646
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:05,562
Well, Eva seems to know
exactly who he is.

647
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:07,330
It's like she was
expecting him last night.

648
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:08,932
He could be the fifth buyer,

649
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:10,800
responsible for killing
the others.

650
00:27:10,802 --> 00:27:12,535
Yeah, laying in wait
at the hotel

651
00:27:12,537 --> 00:27:14,237
last night to grab the Playbook.

652
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:15,905
But Eva was there
when Ferdinand Pisco

653
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:18,575
and Monica Grange
were killed. Why?

654
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:21,111
It's a lot
of unanswered questions.

655
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:23,179
Like, is Torres
even still alive?

656
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:26,249
Torres is alive because Victor
needs him as a bargaining chip.

657
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:27,751
Well, Playbook
can't be opened

658
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:29,452
without Eva's
voice verification.

659
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:32,255
And Eva's the one person
who might be able to fill in

660
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:34,357
the rest of the blanks for us.
Let's go, Gregorio.

661
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,259
Keep digging.

662
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:46,002
I was hoping that my new friend
would join us.

663
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:47,937
I didn't catch her real name.

664
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:49,806
That's too bad.

665
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:53,009
Never would have guessed
that she was a federal agent.

666
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:55,011
Plus, she has
a mean right hook.

667
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:57,013
I'll let her know.

668
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:59,916
Right now, you need
to tell me who Victor is.

669
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:02,319
Russian agent,

670
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:04,187
vicious assassin,

671
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:06,022
my mentor.

672
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:09,025
Taught me
everything I know.

673
00:28:09,027 --> 00:28:12,562
We think he's responsible...

674
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:14,964
for these two murders.

675
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:22,038
Here we are again, Eva.

676
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,374
Yup.

677
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,876
You're accusing me
of crimes I didn't commit.

678
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:28,111
But you did commit a crime.

679
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:30,947
You stole the Playbook
from Homeland.

680
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:32,549
Sell to the highest bidder.

681
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:34,584
Never pegged you
as an opportunist.

682
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,186
You're right.

683
00:28:36,188 --> 00:28:38,955
I was using it as bait
to draw Victor out.

684
00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:40,757
Your mentor.

685
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:44,794
He recruited me
when I was just a child.

686
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:48,698
He took me from my family.

687
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,935
He made me do...
terrible things.

688
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:55,071
He turned me into this.

689
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:56,740
Woman without a country.

690
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:00,009
I saw an opportunity
to pay him back,

691
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:02,145
'cause I knew that he
would come crawling out

692
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:05,415
from under his rock if
the Playbook was up for grabs.

693
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:08,151
It's too big a prize.

694
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:09,953
And then I would have justice.

695
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:14,357
Two people are dead
because of your justice.

696
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,126
Victor has the Playbook

697
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:19,095
and one of our agents.

698
00:29:19,097 --> 00:29:21,598
You need me to get him back.

699
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,266
Trade me for your agent.

700
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:26,236
And we'll take
Victor down together.

701
00:29:26,238 --> 00:29:30,607
Well, problem is,
the way you've acted...

702
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:33,309
don't know how
I can afford to trust you.

703
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:37,147
How can you afford not to?

704
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:50,093
Not sure we can
take Eva at her word.

705
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:51,361
I'm sure we can't.

706
00:29:51,363 --> 00:29:53,062
I know that look in her eyes.

707
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:54,964
She's hell-bent on revenge.
I get it.

708
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:57,300
If I had a chance
to take down my ex-husband

709
00:29:57,302 --> 00:30:00,403
after all the crap he pulled,
nothing would stop me.

710
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:03,640
We need a plan B to get Torres
and the Playbook back safely.

711
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:06,042
McGee and I might have
what you're looking for.

712
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:11,781
Hey.

713
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:13,483
- Hey.
- Got footage

714
00:30:13,485 --> 00:30:16,052
of Victor's SUV leaving
the hotel late last night.

715
00:30:16,054 --> 00:30:17,921
- Before it disappeared into thin air?
- Actually, it didn't.

716
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:19,756
The SUV passed
a number of cameras

717
00:30:19,758 --> 00:30:21,291
while it fled the scene.

718
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:23,159
Yeah, traffic
cameras, security cameras,

719
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:24,360
pedestrians' personal cameras...

720
00:30:24,362 --> 00:30:26,329
If we can access
that feed,

721
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:28,565
we can piece together
exactly where the SUV went.

722
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:30,099
We don't have the resources

723
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:31,267
to consolidate
footage from

724
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,736
dozens of sources
to find a single target.

725
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:35,872
The NSA does.

726
00:30:35,874 --> 00:30:37,574
This case involves
national security

727
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:39,509
and international espionage.

728
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:42,178
I asked Bishop to call in some
favors from her old bosses.

729
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,880
Yeah. We track the SUV
from here.

730
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:45,381
Lasalle and Percy,
they're our boots on the ground

731
00:30:45,383 --> 00:30:46,483
while we gather Intel.

732
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:47,617
We're-we're gonna find Torres.

733
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:49,085
How legal is this, guys?

734
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:51,554
Well, strictly speaking, we're
entering a bit of a gray zone.

735
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:54,924
One of my team was taken by
a sociopathic Russian agent.

736
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:56,726
I say screw the gray zone.

737
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,729
We're with you, McGee.

738
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:01,831
If it'll get
Torres back,

739
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,900
get after it.

740
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:08,137
We need to buy
them more time.

741
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:10,306
No way Victor's sitting around,
waiting to get caught.

742
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:12,308
Well, there's only one way
to keep Victor occupied

743
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,111
while we search for him:
we need to put Eva into play.

744
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:23,319
I'll call Torres's phone.

745
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:26,623
See if I can make
contact with Victor.

746
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:31,261
I was beginning to lose hope
you'd ever call.

747
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:33,162
So was Agent Torres.

748
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:35,064
Is he all right?
He's fine.

749
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:37,333
I'll let you have him back
in return for my agent.

750
00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:40,236
The only reason you want Eva
back is to access the Playbook.

751
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:43,072
Does it really matter,
with Torres's life on the line?

752
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:45,842
I want to speak to him.

753
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:55,118
Speak.

754
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:58,588
Pride.

755
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,491
You okay, Nick?

756
00:32:01,493 --> 00:32:03,293
Well, my allergies are acting up
'cause of all this drywall,

757
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:05,428
but the view of
the parade route from here,

758
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,830
it's, uh...
No hints, Agent Torres.

759
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:09,165
Just say you're fine.

760
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,601
I'm fine.

761
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:14,237
I'll send a text where to
bring Eva for the trade.

762
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,905
Once I have her,
I'll tell you where Torres is.

763
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:17,941
No, no, no, no.
We do an even trade.

764
00:32:17,943 --> 00:32:20,143
Terms are non-negotiable.

765
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:26,282
There's 50 ways
this goes south.

766
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:28,985
That's optimistic.
I can think about 100.

767
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,823
He wants us at

768
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:36,392
the Huey P. Long Bridge
in 20 minutes.

769
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:46,636
Keep this very simple,
and you don't go off book.

770
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:47,837
Understand?

771
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,505
Victor's gonna
go off book.

772
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:51,541
He's gonna double-cross you.
That's what he does.

773
00:32:51,543 --> 00:32:54,510
Yeah, well, that's why we
have the tracking device.

774
00:32:54,512 --> 00:32:56,779
Keep tabs on Victor.

775
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:58,414
Here I was thinking
you were just

776
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:00,717
looking for an excuse
to get fresh.

777
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,518
<i>Lasalle, what's the update?</i>

778
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,154
Good news and bad news.

779
00:33:05,156 --> 00:33:06,656
Sebastian and McGee
were able to track down

780
00:33:06,658 --> 00:33:09,258
Victor's SUV till
its final destination.

781
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,793
- You got eyes on it?
- Yeah.

782
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:13,463
It's parked outside an
abandoned building in the CBD.

783
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:14,631
Bad news?

784
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,599
Well, the building's
30 stories tall.

785
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:18,568
Torres might be inside,
and he might not.

786
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,937
It's gonna take time to search
without alerting the Russians.

787
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:23,673
Yeah, well, time's something
we're running out of.

788
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:25,742
Start searching.

789
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,646
I don't know about all this.

790
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:31,948
What, you worried about
taking on some Russian spies

791
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,650
who are probably
armed to the teeth?

792
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:35,885
No. But I hate stairs,
and looks like we're about

793
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:37,754
to take on a crapload of them.

794
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:45,528
Send Eva alone.

795
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,564
Two of you stay where you are.

796
00:33:50,802 --> 00:33:52,301
Do what he says.

797
00:33:52,303 --> 00:33:54,103
Be ready to
take him out.

798
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:56,539
You'll be okay.

799
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,227
Eva, it's been too long.

800
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:19,462
Our turn now!

801
00:34:19,464 --> 00:34:21,264
Where's Torres?

802
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:24,133
Once we're safely away,
I'll text you the address.

803
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:27,003
Can't wait to catch up with you.

804
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,071
Play your cards right,

805
00:34:28,073 --> 00:34:29,972
you just might survive
this mess.

806
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:33,076
But you will not, Victor.

807
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:43,086
What the hell did you just do?

808
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:45,588
Something I've been waiting for
a long time.

809
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,923
You just killed the one person

810
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:48,825
who could help us
get Torres back.

811
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:10,475
You really screwed
us here, Eva.

812
00:35:10,883 --> 00:35:12,583
Victor's guys
are waiting for his call.

813
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:13,984
Now they'll kill Torres.

814
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,520
He would've killed Torres
anyway. I did you a favor.

815
00:35:16,522 --> 00:35:18,455
How's that?
I bought you time.

816
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:19,590
He would've slit

817
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:21,658
your agent's throat
the minute we pulled away.

818
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,227
Wait, Lasalle
and Sonja are already

819
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:25,195
near Victor's hideout.
We need to call them

820
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:28,265
and give them the exact location
so they can rescue Torres.

821
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,733
I got an idea.

822
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:31,535
But we're gonna need
her help again.

823
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:55,492
She's stalling, but
it's not gonna work for long.

824
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:56,593
What do you got?

825
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:59,196
I have a trace
on the Russian's cell.

826
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,397
All right.
Connecting to the GPS.

827
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:03,167
Getting the exact
coordinates now.

828
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,770
There it is. Bull's-eye. Guys!

829
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:09,406
Guys, we got a hit!
Okay, Sebastian.

830
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:10,507
Tell us where.

831
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:12,209
And tell us softly, please.

832
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,544
17th floor.

833
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,578
Northeast side.

834
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:43,540
You good?

835
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:45,409
I'm good.

836
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:49,113
What took you so long?

837
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:51,181
You do realize it was, like,

838
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:53,717
17 freakin' flights
of stairs, right?

839
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:56,587
You know
I had him, right?

840
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,088
Oh, yeah, you
definitely had him.

841
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,491
Don't people usually
just say thank you?

842
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:02,426
Oh, you're welcome.

843
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,495
Should we
leave him tied up?

844
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:06,029
Yes.

845
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:19,143
Special Agent Torres.

846
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:21,845
Glad to see
you survived your ordeal.

847
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:24,748
Managed to get yourself
in the game.

848
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,417
I told you I hate
riding the bench.

849
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:31,021
You did good, too.

850
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:33,323
Not bad for a couple
of new guys, right?

851
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:35,359
Well, it's not six months
in an Ecuadorian prison

852
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:38,061
just to set up cover, but, uh,

853
00:37:38,063 --> 00:37:40,230
yeah, not bad.

854
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:49,306
Shoving off in five.

855
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:59,483
Beautiful night.

856
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,852
It'll be your last for a while.
Right.

857
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:04,555
They don't have a lot of night
activities in federal prison.

858
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:06,156
Yeah, well, you should've
thought about that

859
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,524
before your little adventure.

860
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:09,726
Believe it or not,
this is exactly how I thought

861
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:11,128
it would all end.

862
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,996
And it was completely worth it.

863
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:16,233
Getting revenge was worth
a lifetime in prison?

864
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:19,603
Meeting you was nice, too.

865
00:38:19,605 --> 00:38:21,038
Too bad we won't be able to get

866
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,639
to know each other
a little better...

867
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:30,013
Never say never.

868
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:46,597
You sure you got to go?
You're gonna miss Mardi Gras.

869
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,632
Hasn't this been Mardi Gras?
No, no, no, no.

870
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:50,300
This has been the lead-up
to Mardi Gras.

871
00:38:50,302 --> 00:38:52,936
Actual Mardi Gras day is
when the city really goes off.

872
00:38:52,938 --> 00:38:55,272
Oh. You know what, I
think I've had my share

873
00:38:55,274 --> 00:38:57,007
of New Orleans
shenanigans.

874
00:38:57,009 --> 00:38:59,643
Maybe next year.
Mm.

875
00:38:59,645 --> 00:39:01,578
Uh...

876
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,049
you think it's okay if maybe
I call you from time to time?

877
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:07,818
Yeah, sure.

878
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,420
The way you, uh, just asked me
made it sound a little weird.

879
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:13,190
Well, you know, I just,
I might need some advice.

880
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:15,592
Get Future Sebastian's wisdom.

881
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:18,262
Okay. But you got to stop
calling me Future Sebastian.

882
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:20,530
The fact is, you
are Past McGee.

883
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,599
And doing a real
good job of it.

884
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:25,269
Ah, there you are, McGee.

885
00:39:25,271 --> 00:39:27,804
I just dropped some food off
with Torres in the car.

886
00:39:27,806 --> 00:39:30,007
- A little snack for the road.
- Oh, appreciate that. Thank you.

887
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:32,643
Pleasure. Listen, keep
an eye on Eva, okay?

888
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:34,778
She's tricky.
You got it.

889
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,680
- Jethro.
- Special Agent Pride.

890
00:39:36,682 --> 00:39:39,516
You'll be happy to know
I'm sending your team home

891
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:41,952
mostly in one piece.

892
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:44,588
Eh, you pulled it off
on your own. Not bad.

893
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,424
I'm just glad we kept
all of official Washington

894
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,659
from flooding the city.

895
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:50,394
Yeah. This time, at least.

896
00:39:50,396 --> 00:39:52,496
Well, let's keep it that way.
What do you say?

897
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:54,798
Unless, of course,
it's for a social visit.

898
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,501
Next time there's another party,

899
00:39:57,503 --> 00:40:00,637
I might just pop down,
surprise you, Dwayne.

900
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,606
This is New Orleans,
my brother.

901
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,574
There's always
another party going on.
