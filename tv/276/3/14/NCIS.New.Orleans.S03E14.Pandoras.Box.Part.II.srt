10
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:31,184
McGee 我现在不方便说话
McGee, I can't talk now.

11
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:33,019
-你在哪里 -我找到了Ferdinand Pisco
- Where are you? - Found Ferdinand Pisco.

12
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:34,387
我正在跟踪他
I'm following him now.

13
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,389
一个人吗 你应该打电话给我的
Alone? You were gonna call me.

14
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:37,991
是 我知道
Yeah, well, I understand that.

15
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:39,759
事发有些突然
Well, it happened kind of quick.

16
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:41,161
我们应该是合作的关系
<i>We're supposed to be working together.</i>

17
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:42,429
这家伙需要
<i>This guy needs to be</i>

18
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:43,663
低调处理
handled on the down-low.

19
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:46,766
坦白说 你在人群中挺显眼的
Frankly, you stick out in a crowd.

20
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:49,169
-那不是... -我得挂了
- That is not... - I got to go.

21
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:51,104
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}Yo, this the home of the Saints

22
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:53,073
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}Sinners in the streets, chrome on the Benz

23
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,408
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}The night life, we drink until we faint...

24
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:58,845
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}Whoadie, what it do

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}Louisiana L, but we never, never lose

26
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:03,616
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}Push it like weight, little mama keep movin'

27
00:01:03,618 --> 00:01:05,618
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}We on Bourbon Street just foolin'

28
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,188
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}Gettin' po'd up till they ask, “What you doing”

29
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,557
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}Woop-woop, that's the sound of the police...

30
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,525
站住 联邦探员
Stop! Federal agent!

31
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:29,309
警察 不许动
Police! Don't move!

32
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,478
放下武器
Drop your weapon!

39
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:58,871
NCIS <font color=#00FF00>新奥尔良</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>S03E14</font>

40
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:02,809
嫌疑人身上都是血 带着这个
Suspect was covered in blood, armed with this.

41
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:05,879
声称是NCIS的人 但没有任何证明
Claimed he was NCIS, but no credentials.

42
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:07,781
说是在进行卧底工作
Said he was working undercover.

43
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:10,150
我把他拘留了
I had to take him into custody.

44
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:11,518
他是你们的人吗
Is he one of yours?

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,086
他们这样告诉我的
So they tell me.

46
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:15,555
-你做得对 Pete -谢谢
- You did the right thing, Pete. - Thanks.

47
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:16,723
嗯
Mm-hmm.

48
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,893
Pride
Pride.

49
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:21,528
我们在MTAC见过
We met over MTAC.

50
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:21,528
{\a6}多重威胁警报中心 (Multiple Threat Alert Center)

51
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,962
Nick Torres
Nick Torres.

52
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:25,365
你给我留下的第一印象很深刻 Nick Torres
You make quite a first impression, Nick Torres.

53
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:28,234
来这座城市两小时不到 就被当作嫌疑人
Less than two hours in my city,and you get yourself arrested

54
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:30,403
拘留了
as a suspected murderer.

55
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:33,139
这可以算是某种纪录了吧
That's got to be some kind of record.

56
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:35,975
我可以解释
I got an explanation.

57
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:37,644
你和特别探员McGee
Yeah, you and Special Agent McGee

58
00:02:37,646 --> 00:02:40,046
被派到新奥尔良取回被盗的情报 是吗
were sent to New Orleans to recover stolen Intel, yes?

59
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:42,015
是的 情报被称作恐袭剧本
Yes. It's called the Playbook.

60
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:43,316
汇总了多种
It's a collection of scenarios

61
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:44,918
针对美国的可行的恐怖袭击方案
for viable terrorist attacks against the U.S.

62
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,321
从国土安全部偷的 这个我知道
Stolen from Homeland Security. I... That much I know.

63
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:50,957
我不知道的是 你为什么在行动前
What I don't know is why you ran an operation

64
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,026
不先来报到
without checking in first.

65
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:55,395
在跟踪我做卧底时的前任联系人
Tracking down a former contact of my undercover days.

66
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:56,629
那可是这起谋杀案的受害者
That would be the murder victim.

67
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:59,065
Ferdinand Pisco 委内瑞拉特工
Ferdinand Pisco. Venezuelan operative.

68
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,534
他到城里是为了得到恐袭剧本
Uh, he's in town to acquire the Playbook.

69
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:03,570
必须处理地
Had to handle it, um...

70
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:05,004
谨慎
delicately.

71
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:06,639
啊
Ah.

72
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,309
那个词在华盛顿一定有不同的含义
That word must have a different meaning up in D.C.

73
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,145
但是在这里 在新奥尔良 在狂欢节上
But down here, in New Orleans, at Mardi Gras,

74
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:14,948
NCIS喜欢更低调些
NCIS likes to keep a lower profile.

75
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,484
Pride 我应该来报道的 这怪我
Pride, I was supposed to check in. That's on me.

76
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:19,719
但我做的只是跟着那家伙
But all I did was follow the guy.

77
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:22,388
杀他的另有其人
Someone else killed him.

78
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,690
很可能是为了确保
Probably to make sure

79
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:25,558
Ferdinand得不到恐袭剧本
Ferdinand didn't get the Playbook.

80
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,693
可能吧
Probably.

81
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:27,827
嗯
Mm-hmm.

82
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,763
我们必须查出是谁
We have to find out who.

83
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,066
有个比较蠢的问题 呃
And here's a silly question... um...

84
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:35,735
你现在能解开我的手铐了吗
you think you could take these,uh, handcuffs off me now?

85
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:37,837
还没想好
Haven't decided yet.

86
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,606
Pride 我得告诉你
Pride, I'm telling you,

87
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:42,275
我的第二印象要比第一印象好得多
my second impression is so much better than the first.

88
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:45,311
希望如此
One can only hope.

89
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,616
Loretta
Loretta.

90
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:50,850
Dwayne
Dwayne.

91
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:53,786
我可不希望这样度过
This is not exactly how I expected to spend

92
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,221
狂欢节前的周末
the weekend before Mardi Gras.

93
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:57,357
估计Ferdinand Pisco
Imagine it wasn't how Ferdinand Pisco

94
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,392
也不希望这样度过
expected it would go either.

95
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:01,961
我认为等他感觉到受伤时
I don't think he even realized he was injured

96
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:03,062
已经太迟了
until it was too late.

97
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:05,431
就目前判断 只有一处刺伤
It's a single stab wound,as far as I can tell.

98
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,400
最短时间内造成的最大伤害
Maximum damage in minimum time.

99
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:09,068
-有凶手的线索吗 -有的
- Anything on the killer? - Oh, yeah.

100
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,837
找了多名目击者谈话
Spoke to multiple witnesses

101
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:12,372
他们都能肯定地指出嫌疑人
who positively I.D.'d the suspect.

102
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:15,375
不幸的是 他们描述的人就是他
Unfortunately,they all described him.

103
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:19,379
Nick Torres 你好
Nick Torres. How you doing?

104
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:21,414
我是Gregorio 但愿
I'm Gregorio. I'd be better if you had more

105
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,117
你有嫌疑人的更多信息 除了说"穿着小丑的衣服"
on the murder suspect than just“wearing a harlequin costume.”

106
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,552
真不好意思 我不知道
So embarrassing.I had no idea

107
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:27,187
穿成这样是这里流行的时尚
that was a common fashion statement here.

108
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,621
喜剧的克鲁
Krewe of Commedia.

109
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,621
{\a6}主持新奥尔良狂欢节的民间组织

110
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:29,856
他们每年都会在这里举办聚会
They had their annual party here.

111
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,658
呃 什么人
Uh, crew of what now?

112
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,960
是新奥尔良的玩意儿 我现在也还不清楚
It's a New Orleans thing I'm still not clear on.

113
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:35,395
也就是说 昨晚有上百个
It means there were over a hundred Harlequins

114
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:36,629
穿成那样的小丑
dressed like that last night.

115
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:39,299
警方正尽力召集他们进行询问
NOPD's interviewing as many as they can round up.

116
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,968
能这样行凶的人一定早早就有了
Anyone who can kill like this had an escape route--

117
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,636
逃脱路线
long gone.

118
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:45,972
天啊 这太恶心了
Oh, man, that's so gross.

119
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:47,540
你发现了什么 Sebastian
What you got there, Sebastian?

120
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,943
死者的手机 很可能还有丙肝病毒
Victim's cell phone.And probably a case of hep C,

121
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:51,511
因为我刚检查完这个排水沟
considering this gutter I just pulled it out of.

122
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:52,912
我得回家 洗个
I'm gonna need to go home and take, like,

123
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:54,380
长长的"丝克伍"澡
a long Silkwood shower.

124
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:54,380
{\a6}特指洗去环境带来的异味和污秽，源于凯伦·丝克伍事件

125
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:57,383
看上去被水浸坏了 你能恢复数据吗
Looks water damaged.Can you retrieve the data?

126
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,285
可以 我这就去
Oh, yeah, I'm on it.

127
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,653
Gregorio
Gregorio,

128
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:02,021
去查监控 我们需要了解
check surveillance.We need something more

129
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:04,390
凶手的更多信息 除了他看上去
on our killer other than he looks like

130
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:05,491
像这位Torres
Torres here.

131
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:07,660
-嗯 -所以 Ferdinand
- Mm-hmm. - So, Ferdinand

132
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:10,263
是来这里和偷恐袭剧本的人碰面
was here to meet up with whoever stole the Playbook.

133
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:11,998
关于那个人的身份有新消息吗
Any update on who that might be?

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,733
那是Mcgee负责的部分
That would be McGee's department.

135
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:16,002
Mcgee在哪里
Where's McGee?

136
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:18,271
外面太疯狂了
It is absolutely crazy out there.

137
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:21,074
Mcgee探员 终于来新奥尔良了
Agent McGee, finally in New Orleans.

138
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:22,175
你怎么样
How you doing?

139
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:23,843
还有你在这儿的第一个狂欢节怎么样
And your first Mardi Gras in the quarter.

140
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:26,279
我看你已经感染新奥尔良的氛围了
I see you've already caught on to the New Orleans vibe.

141
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:27,914
白天饮酒就是第一步
Day drinking is step one.

142
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,115
我没有喝酒
I-I am not day drinking.

143
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,483
有人硬塞给我的
Someone forced this into my hand.

144
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:32,252
是 你说了算 闪亮小伙儿
Yeah, if you say so, glitter boo.

145
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,537
不过 我确实是带着礼物来的
I do, uh, come bearing gifts, however.

146
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:35,335
我能用下你的电脑么
Can I use your computer?

147
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,303
当然
Absolutely.

148
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:39,672
我从一开始就一直在追踪偷恐袭剧本的人的
Been tracking the digital trail of whoever stole the Playbook

149
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,307
数字足迹
in the first place.

150
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,342
他们在这几天有些动作
They've been making some moves the last couple days.

151
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,977
是么 什么动作
Yeah? What kind of moves?

152
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,379
国安局关于恐袭剧本有了新发现
NSA's had an uptick in their chatter about the Playbook.

153
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,582
小偷正在网上拍卖它
Thief is putting it up for auction.

154
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:50,916
价高者得
It's going to the highest bidder.

155
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,885
来自全球各地的
So multiple bad actors

156
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:55,754
多个坏人想要出价
from all over the globe trying to make a bid.

157
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,122
Timothy McGee
Timothy McGee.

158
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,091
当成自己家
Make yourself at home.

159
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,326
-你好吗 -不错
- How are you? - Good.

160
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,493
早
Morning.

161
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,494
狂欢节中的新奥尔良
So, New Orleans at Mardi Gras

162
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,463
最适合这样的竞价
is perfect for an auction like this.

163
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,698
城中有上百万游客
Million visitors in the city,

164
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,132
一半都带着面具
half of them in masks.

165
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,435
进出都不容易被发现
Easy to slip in and out without being seen.

166
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:10,870
那咱们上街碰碰运气
Well, then let's hit the streets.

167
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,571
把恐袭剧本带回来
Let's get that Playbook back.

168
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:16,041
昨晚的事之后 你哪里都不要去了
Uh, you're not hitting anything after last night.

169
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,611
我主动出击联系了Ferdinand Pisco
Hey, I took initiative to contact Ferdinand Pisco.

170
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,279
行动失败不是我的错
I'm not the reason the operation went sour.

171
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:22,381
你要说服的不是我
I'm not the one you need to convince.

172
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,816
嗨 老大
Hey, boss.

173
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,651
对
Yeah.

174
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,553
他就在这
He's right here.

175
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,755
事实上 他想跟Pride说话
Actually, he wants to talk to Pride.

176
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,925
你还好吧 Dwayne
Are you holding up okay, Dwayne?

177
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,360
真希望国土安全部的麻烦
Wish Homeland's mess

178
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:36,495
没有在我们的后院失火 但是我们会解决的
hadn't ended up in our backyard, but we'll deal with it.

179
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,497
如果你想要 这里有支援
Got backup available if you want it.

180
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,965
更多的探员会带来更多的问题
More agents means more questions.

181
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,934
我想此事不要声张
I want to keep this contained.

182
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:44,470
那可就难了 国际特工的嫌疑人档案
That's gonna be hard to do. We've got a rogue's gallery

183
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,705
正在送来新奥尔良
of international operatives descending on New Orleans.

184
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,207
华盛顿的所有当局都想参与
Every agency in D.C. wants in.

185
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,675
我不久前
I just got through

186
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:52,278
才刚与FBI联手办过Javier Garcia的案子
hand-holding the FBI on the Javier Garcia case.

187
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,579
可不想再来个续集了
Don't need a sequel.

188
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,314
收到 我会进行干涉的
Roger that. I'll run interference.

189
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:56,715
谢了 Jethro
Appreciate it, Jethro.

190
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,385
你一向更会和管理层打交道
You always had a gentler way with the suits.

191
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,856
抱歉 刚刚不是在开玩笑吗
Sorry, that wasn't a joke?

192
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,391
叫Torres来
Send Torres in.

193
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:06,992
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

194
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,027
好的 老大
You got it, boss.

195
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,762
-McGee -咋了 老大
- McGee. - Yeah, boss?

196
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,163
你脖子上的是什么东西
What is that around your neck?

197
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,333
哦 这些是串珠 是节日的东西
Oh, uh, they're beads. It's a festive thing.

198
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,101
想要融入...
Trying to get into the...

199
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,636
别管了
Never mind.

200
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,972
走错了
Wrong door.

201
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,213
我从Ferdinand Pisco的坏手机中
So I was able to retrieve data

202
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,134
恢复了数据
off of Ferdinand Pisco's busted cell phone.

203
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:31,791
-有什么线索 -短信
- What'd you get? - Texts.

204
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,365
他在跟偷恐袭剧本的人联系
He was, uh, communicating with whoever stole the Playbook.

205
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,493
他们本应在镇上见面的
They were supposed to meet in the Quarter.

206
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:38,461
对 有人在会面之前就杀了Pisco
Yeah, someone killed Pisco before the meeting took place.

207
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:40,330
从短信中能找到Pisco
Well, able to get us anything on Pisco

208
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:42,065
-或者小偷的线索么 -不行
- or the thief from the texts? - No.

209
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,634
但是我能追查手机的序列号
But I was able to trace the serial number from the phone,

210
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:46,669
这是几天前从一个机场小卖摊
and it was one of five burner phones

211
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:49,839
购买的五个一次性手机中的一个
purchased together at an airport kiosk a few days ago.

212
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,535
五个手机可能是五个买家
Five phones can mean five buyers.

213
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,677
我们只需要追踪手机 就能找到所有买家
All we have to do is track the phones, and we find all the buyers.

214
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,312
追踪手机可不简单
Tracking the phones isn't that easy.

215
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:59,115
你不能直接追踪信号塔的信号
Can't you just trace the ping from the cellular towers

216
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:00,783
进行三角定位之类的么
and triangulate or whatever?

217
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:02,919
不不 这都2017年了 Sonja
No, it's-it's 2017 now, Sonja.

218
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:04,821
基站定位的时代已经过去了
The era of the ping is long gone.

219
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,890
就连最便宜的一次性手机也装有GPS
Even cheap burner phones are GPS enabled.

220
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:09,392
真正的GPS追踪专家是Patton
You know, the real GPS tracking expert is Patton,

221
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:12,662
但他去给JSOC当网络安全顾问去了
and he's off consulting JSOC on some online security issue.

222
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:12,662
{\a6}联合特种作战司令部(Joint Special Operations Command)

223
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:14,864
嘿 跟你们说 不是我吹牛
Hey, you know, uh, I don't mean to brag,

224
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,500
但我写过一个算法 算得上是卫星定位的
but I wrote an algorithm that is kind of a game changer

225
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:19,102
革新算法
in satellite circles.

226
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:20,803
-天呐 -你是
- Geez. - You're...

227
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:23,640
你是 你就是McGee 对吧
you're, uh... you're McGee, right?

228
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:25,074
呃 是我
Uh, yeah, yeah.

229
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:27,277
我叫Sebastian 我听说过你的很多故事
Yeah. I'm Sebastian. I-I've heard so much about you.

230
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,945
哦 是么
Oh, you have?

231
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:31,381
你一夜间从技术人员变成了特别探员
Well, you went from tech support to special agent overnight.

232
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:33,183
是FLETC的传奇啊
Sort of a legend at FLETC.

233
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:33,183
{\a6}联邦执法培训中心(Federal Law Enforcement Training Center)

234
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:34,317
至少对我来说
At least, you know, to me.

235
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:35,418
那并没有那么简单
It-it wasn't quite that simple.

236
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,187
-不过 这个是简单的 -哦
- But, uh, this is. - Oh.

237
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:39,155
我来给你展示 你只需要
Let me show you this. All you need to do is

238
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:40,957
输入序列号
enter the serial numbers.

239
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:48,131
哇 这 这太神奇了
Whoa, this is, this is amazing.

240
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,833
这绝对不是刚体跟踪算法
There's no way that this is, uh, a rigid tracking algorithm.

241
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,769
不不不 刚体跟踪并不好 卫星电话
No, no, no. Rigid tracking's no good. Satellite phones

242
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:54,237
总在移动的 所以这个是
are always on the move, so this is

243
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,573
一个对地同步的步进追踪过程
a geosynchronous step track processing,

244
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,758
外加一点生动的设计
with a little bit of pizzazz on the side.

245
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,376
没错 对 完全明白了
Of course. Yeah, makes total sense.

246
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:00,677
哈 是吗
Ha. To who?

247
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,881
等一下 有一个手机刚刚开机了
Oh, wait. One of the burner phones just powered on.

248
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:06,449
在阿姆斯特朗公园附近
Somewhere near Armstrong Park.

249
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,651
我可以马上看到精确的位置
I'm getting the exact coordinates now.

250
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:09,675
很好
Nice.

251
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,199
有很多游客和一些醉鬼
Got a lot of tourists and a bunch of drunks.

252
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:24,667
不确定我们要找的是谁
Not sure who we're looking for.

253
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,636
有线索能帮到我们么 Sebastian
Any clues to help us out, Sebastian?

254
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:28,972
我只能告诉你 用那个手机的人
All I can tell you is that whoever is using

255
00:09:28,974 --> 00:09:31,374
正在积极地发短信
that burner phone is actively texting right now.

256
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:34,711
我可能看到目标了
Well, think I see our target.

257
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:37,880
女士 我需要你转过身
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to turn around,

258
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:39,449
把手举起来
put your hands in the air!

259
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:46,122
她死了
She's dead.

260
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:48,424
像Pisco一样被捅死了
Stabbed just like Pisco.

261
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:50,960
刚刚才发生的
It just happened.

262
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:53,563
是 凶手一定就在附近
Yeah, and whoever did it was just here.

263
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:14,839
据DNA显示 死者是Monica Grange
According to DNA, this is Monica Grange.

264
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:17,475
美国公民 化名加拿大人来旅游
U.S. citizen traveling under a Canadian alias.

265
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:19,177
因为跟一个叙利亚恐怖组织有关
Wanted in four different countries

266
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,212
被四个国家通缉
for ties to a Syrian terrorist group.

267
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,815
没错 待在暗中好些年 当中间人
Yeah, been off the grid for years acting as a middleman,

268
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:26,050
购买武器 情报 爆炸物
buying weapons, Intel, explosives.

269
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,385
可能在城里
Probably in town

270
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:29,287
准备购买恐袭剧本 就跟Ferdinand一样
to bid for the Playbook, just like Ferdinand.

271
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:30,588
还跟Ferdinand一样的是
And just like Ferdinand,

272
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,423
她在联系到那个卖家之前
she got stabbed before she could make contact

273
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,058
就被刺杀了
with whoever the seller is.

274
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,061
一天之内 两个特工在城里被杀
Two operatives in town murdered within a day.

275
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:39,564
凶手可能是另外的买家 想要干掉竞争者
Killer could be another buyer taking out the competition.

276
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:42,433
如果其他人都死了 讨价还价会简单一些
Easier to negotiate if everyone else is dead.

277
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:44,402
Sebastian和McGee正在追踪
Well, Sebastian and McGee are tracking down

278
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:46,471
剩下的一次性手机和买家
the remaining burner phones and buyers.

279
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:49,140
关于我们的凶手 我们只掌握了
Well, as for our killer, all we got is

280
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:52,477
嫌疑人昨晚逃跑的录像
footage of the suspect running away last night.

281
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:55,213
所以我们要怎么把恐袭剧本拿回来
So how do we get the Playbook back?

282
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,581
跟我说说吧
Talk to me.

283
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,816
Monica Grange死前正在跟凶手通信
Monica Grange was corresponding with the killer before she died.

284
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:00,118
他们本应在今晚见面
They were supposed to meet tonight.

285
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,419
我们有Monica的手机
We have Monica's phone.

286
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:03,354
我的身份是干净的 安排一次会面
I have a clean identity. Set up a meet.

287
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:04,922
我代替她出场
I'll go in in her place.

288
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:06,657
卖家一定会很谨慎
Seller's proven to be careful-- not gonna have

289
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,359
不会带着恐袭剧本去见面
the Playbook on him at the meeting.

290
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:11,496
如果不是女人出现 卖家可能会吓跑
Anyone but a woman shows up, seller could spook.

291
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:13,064
如果我作为Monica去呢
Well, what if I go in as Monica?

292
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:15,900
她一直待在暗中 也没有近照
I mean, she's been off the grid, no current photo.

293
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:17,969
卖家不会知道的
Seller will have no idea.

294
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,303
卖家会知道一切的
Seller will have every idea.

295
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,105
很抱歉 不过你带着警察的臭味
I'm sorry, but you reek of cop.

296
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:22,974
-你是想说我很难闻吗 -不 我是说
- You trying to say I smell? - No, I'm saying

297
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,876
卧底工作需要一定的天赋
that undercover work takes a certain flair.

298
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:27,178
就像你昨晚被逮捕的那种天赋吗
Like the flair you had last night when you got arrested?

299
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,579
哦 真的吗 我们要翻旧账吗
Oh, really? We're gonna do that?

300
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:29,947
听着 我只是想说
Look, all I'm trying to say is

301
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:32,083
如果我们想不动声色地把恐袭剧本拿回来
if we want to get the Playbook back <i>quietly,</i>

302
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,484
那我就是合适人选
then I'm your girl.

303
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:34,952
Gregorio说得没错
Gregorio's right.

304
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,487
学习Monica Grange的生活模式
Study up on Monica Grange

305
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:37,989
直到卖家出现
until the seller reaches out.

306
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:40,091
我得去验尸房了
I got to go to autopsy.

307
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:45,430
你发现了什么 Loretta
What'd you find, Loretta?

308
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:48,099
恐怕是这骇人的相似
Frightful symmetry, I'm afraid.

309
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:51,702
两个受害人都是被一刀刺入两根肋骨之间
Both victims killed with a single stab between the ribs...

310
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,440
直接刺穿心脏 很快就流血身亡了
...puncturing the heart, bled out within moments.

311
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:57,175
甚至没来得及意识到被刺
Probably didn't even realize they were stabbed

312
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,476
就已经太迟了
before it was too late.

313
00:11:58,478 --> 00:11:59,477
武器的刀刃很薄
The weapon was thin-bladed.

314
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,212
很可能是短剑
Stiletto, most likely.

315
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:03,881
凶手是一个娴熟的专家 能够在人群中随意出入
Killer's a skilled expert who can slip in and out of a crowd

316
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:05,950
-还不被发现 -是的 没有留下任何纤维
- without being noticed. - Yeah, no sign of fibers,

317
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:07,452
以及DNA和指纹
DNA, fingerprints.

318
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:08,853
训练有素的情报探员吗
Trained intelligence agent?

319
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:10,188
或者是个刺客
Or an assassin.

320
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,557
无论凶手是谁 我们都得马上牵制住他
Whoever the killer is, we need to contain him now.

321
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,592
一个极度娴熟的刺客
A highly skilled assassin

322
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:17,195
漫步在狂欢节中的新奥尔良街头
roaming the streets of New Orleans at Mardi Gras.

323
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:18,863
Dwayne
Dwayne.

324
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,033
也许是时候该叫装甲部队了
Maybe it's time to call in the cavalry.

325
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:24,268
如果我们那么做了 来的就不只是FBI了
Well, if we do that, it won't just be the FBI coming.

326
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,504
-还会有CIA -对啊 那些人太恶心了
- Be CIA, too. - Yeah, and those guys suck.

327
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:28,272
是啊 会像西大荒一样
Yeah, it'll be like the Wild West.

328
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:28,272
{\a6}尤指尚无法制的美国西部

329
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:31,576
不能让这事发生  Sebastian
Can't let that happen. Sebastian,

330
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:33,044
告诉我你有好消息
tell me you got good news.

331
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:35,279
McGee和我黑进了最后三个手机
McGee and I were able to hack the last three burner phones.

332
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,081
也就是说我们可以追踪它们的位置了
Means we can track their locations.

333
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,749
是啊 不过 我们可以做得更好
Yeah, well, we can do better than that.

334
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:40,318
我们可以把买家引过来
We're gonna draw the buyers to us.

335
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,920
伪装成卖家 给他们发信息
Send them text messages, pretending to be the seller,

336
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:46,290
然后把他们清理干净 经典的请君入瓮行动
then sweep them up-- classic false flag operation.

337
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,359
那是什么意思 具体点
And what does that mean, exactly?

338
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,927
我也不知道 McGee这么说的
I have no idea-- something that McGee said.

339
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:51,295
但是听起来真的很酷 对吧
But it sounds really cool, right?

340
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:53,397
Chris Sonja
Chris, Sonja,

341
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,766
帮助McGee和Sebastian把买家吸引过来
help McGee and Sebastian bring in the buyers.

342
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:58,569
记住 他们之中可能会有那个凶手
And remember, any one of them could be our killer.

343
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:00,338
需要你们谨慎行动
Need you to proceed with caution.

344
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,173
明白
You got it.

345
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:04,342
这是国际刑警组织
That's the entirety

346
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,877
关于Monica Grange的全部文件
of Interpol's file on Monica Grange.

347
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,245
勉强一页纸
It's barely a page long.

348
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,579
只好将就一下了
It'll have to do.

349
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:10,348
她是个专业律师
She's a lawyer by profession,

350
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,283
所以你得假装你懂法律
so you're gonna have to pretend like you understand law.

351
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:13,584
不用假装
Don't need to pretend.

352
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:16,654
我就是律师 加入FBI以前上过法学院
I am a lawyer; went to law school before joining the FBI.

353
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:19,090
她会说一口流利的阿拉伯语
She's fluent in Arabic.

354
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:21,359
我猜你不会
I'm assuming you're not.

355
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,227
不会 但是我曾经
No, but I dated

356
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:26,497
跟一个埃及人约会过 学过一两个句子
an Egyptian once and learned a phrase or two.

357
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,132
要知道 作为一个从未做过卧底的人
You know, you're pretty cocky

358
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:30,101
你相当自负啊
for someone that's never worked undercover before.

359
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:32,169
哦 我曾经参与过卧底任务
Oh, I've worked undercover ops before.

360
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:34,805
好吧 但我说的可不是那种 花几天时间
Yeah, well, I'm not talking about a couple of days

361
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:36,474
获取信任
of playing make-believe,

362
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:39,110
拿下毒贩的小把戏
take down a drug dealer.

363
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,545
我说的是
I'm talking about

364
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:43,848
作为另一个人 生活好几年
spending years being another person.

365
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,585
时间长到让你
So long that you...

366
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:49,320
让你忘记自己真正是谁
you forget who you really are.

367
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:51,222
很有意思
Fascinating.

368
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:54,392
但是我只需要一两个小时 拿到恐袭剧本 所以...
But all I need is an hour or two to get the Playbook back, so...

369
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:56,294
而你只需要搞砸一次
And all you need is to screw up once,

370
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:58,262
整个形势就会变得极其严峻
and this entire situation goes pear-shaped.

371
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,531
你知道 我的阿拉伯语可能不流利
You know, I may not be fluent in Arabic,

372
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,400
但我对肢体语言很熟悉
but I am fluent in body language,

373
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:05,403
让你坐板凳简直要了你的命
and it's killing you to ride the bench.

374
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:08,472
让我坐板凳确实很要命
It's killing me to ride the bench.

375
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,677
你知道 我是坐不住的人 我是个喜欢外勤任务的人
You know, I'm not a bench guy; I'm an on-the-field kind of guy.

376
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,145
不是很喜欢团队行动 哈
Not much of a team player, huh?

377
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,681
没错 这种 呃
No, this, uh...

378
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:19,317
团队的事情 我是近来才参与的
team thing has been pretty recent.

379
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:20,384
这需要调整
It's an adjustment.

380
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:22,353
我明白 作为一个新人 加入到
I get it. It's not easy being the new guy

381
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:23,888
一群共事很久的人中间 很不容易
with a group that's worked so long together.

382
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,656
没错 比如说他们内部才懂的笑话...
Yeah, I mean, inside jokes alone...

383
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:27,558
是啊 而且你无法完全确信
Yeah, and you're never fully confident that

384
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,027
他们真的需要你 那感觉就像 我这是在做什么呢
they actually need you, right? It's, like, what am I doing?

385
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:31,462
没错
Exactly.

386
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:32,897
但是我需要你 Torres
Well, I'm gonna need you, Torres,

387
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,699
因为我完全不知道我在做什么
'cause I have no idea what I'm doing.

388
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:36,334
我们从那儿开始 好吗
So let's just start there, all right?

389
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:42,173
这是卖家
It's the seller.

390
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,307
8点会面
Meeting's at 8:00.

391
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:44,575
Sazerac酒吧
Sazerac Bar.

392
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,344
我会告诉Pride
I'll let Pride know.

393
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,856
不应该这么做 Sebastian
Not gonna want to do that, Sebastian.

394
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:01,092
眼睛往前看 或者看我
Keep your eyes forward or on me.

395
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:02,994
好吧 那 那我们怎么知道目标什么时候出现呢
Well, how-how will we know when the target's here?

396
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:04,128
窗户玻璃的反射
Window reflections.

397
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,530
在那安装了安全反射镜
Got a security mirror up there.

398
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,867
大约还有五种方法可以知道我们身后发生了什么
There's about five other ways to know what's going on behind us.

399
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,103
怎么了 我的头发里还有亮片吗
What, I still got glitter in my hair?

400
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,104
不是
No.

401
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:14,805
还是有的 但不是这个问题
Well, yeah, but that's not it.

402
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:16,874
你跟我一样是个书呆子 你知道吗
You're a nerd like me, you know?

403
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:18,943
但你是那种了不起的书呆子
But you're, like,this badass nerd.

404
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:20,645
你很擅长这些
You're so good at this.

405
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:22,313
只是有更多的经验
Eh. Just have more experience.

406
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:23,948
不是的 你让这事看起来很容易
No, you-you make it look easy.

407
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,050
我却只会把事情搞砸
I just keep messing up.

408
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,485
听着
Look...

409
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,554
当我是个菜鸟的时候 我也总是会搞砸
when I was a probie,I messed up all the time.

410
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,156
我犯过非常多错误
Okay? I made a ton of mistakes.

411
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:34,191
但我很幸运 我有几位至关重要的导师
But I was fortunate;I had some key mentors

412
00:15:34,193 --> 00:15:35,826
手把手地教我
that showed me the ropes.

413
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:38,129
那么他们肯定非常有耐心 还很宽容
Well, they must have been very patient and forgiving, then.

414
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:39,730
他们很不讲情面 有时候还很刻薄
They were merciless. Downright mean sometimes.

415
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:41,132
但是你知道吗
But you know what?

416

Just not you.

554
00:21:59,562 --> 00:22:01,045
嘿 Gregorio
Hey, Gregorio,

555
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:03,380
你觉得你应该尽快提出恐袭剧本的事情
you think you might bring up the Playbook anytime soon,

556
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:05,081
还是像第二次约会一样
or is that a like a second date

557
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,383
有问有答
type of question?

558
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:07,584
对我失望了吗
Do I disappoint?

559
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:09,119
一点都没有
Not in the least.

560
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,387
说真的 Pride
Honestly, Pride, how long

561
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:12,021
这前戏我们要玩多久
are we gonna go on with the foreplay?

562
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:14,157
Gregorio 你也许该推一下进度了
Gregorio, you might want to give her a push.

563
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:17,293
好了 我们谈正事吧
Well, let's talk business.

564
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,963
我的雇主希望能尽快出个价
My employer is eager to make an offer.

565
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:23,600
我还没想好自己对出价是否感兴趣
I haven't decided if I'm entertaining an offer.

566
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:26,002
那我还能做点什么来说服你呢
Well, what else do I have to do to convince you?

567
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:27,604
在电梯里见我
Meet me at the elevator.

568
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:28,638
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

569
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,673
我的房间 带着你的酒
My room. And bring your drink.

570
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:33,410
因为这是唯一能让你看到恐袭剧本的办法
'Cause it's the only way you're gonna get to see the Playbook.

571
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:36,012
我会非常规矩的
I'll be on my best behavior.

572
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:37,514
我保证
Promise.

573
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:42,852
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}♪ But I wish, but I wish I was ♪

574
00:22:42,854 --> 00:22:46,723
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs12\an9}♪ Ooh, I wish, oh, wish I was... ♪

575
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:48,458
我要过去了 哥们
I'm heading up, boys.

576
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:51,961
如果苗头稍有不对 Gregorio
One sideways glance, Gregorio,

577
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:54,130
我们就立即终止整个行动
we shut this whole operation down.

578
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,806
请把武器放在桌子上
Weapon on the table, please.

579
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:05,442
你也是
You, too.

580
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:13,616
嗯
Hmm.

581
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:18,888
顶层套房
Penthouse.

582
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,658
能看到整个街区 很不错
View of the Quarter. Very nice.

583
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,093
十楼 酒店东侧
Tenth floor, east side of the hotel.

584
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:26,696
你一发话 我就行动
You say the word, I'm on the move.

585
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:31,234
我订这个房间不是为了风景
I didn't book the room because of the view.

586
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:33,570
阳台能让我上到楼顶
Balcony gives me access to the roof.

587
00:23:33,572 --> 00:23:35,004
必要时候 是一条逃生路线
Escape route if I need it.

588
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:38,174
偏执的生活方式
Paranoid way of life.

589
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,977
我们这行生存的方式
Only way to survive in our line.

590
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:42,445
但很累人
Gets tiring, though.

591
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:44,013
为什么干这个呢
Why do it?

592
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:46,015
我有我的原因
I've got my reasons.

593
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:47,417
这就是恐袭剧本
Here's the Playbook.

594
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:50,353
语音激活的安全系统 需要我的声音
Voice activation security needs my voice.

595
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:51,961
祸不单行

596
00:23:56,094 --> 00:23:58,661
看看吧
Have a look.

597
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:09,906
-Sebastian -Pride
- Sebastian. - Pride.

598
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,141
我运行的步态分析软件 刚刚得到一个匹配结果
I just got a hit back on that gait analysis I was running.

599
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:13,576
什么是步态分析软件
What's gait analysis?

600
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,178
现在解释这个太复杂了
It's too complicated to explain right now.

601
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,947
简单说 我们查出了谋杀嫌犯的身份
Bottom line, we got an I.D. on our murder suspect.

602
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:20,083
匹配结果是Eva Azarova
Eva Azarova came back as a match.

603
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,484
你确定吗
Are you sure?

604
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:22,519
程序不是百分百精确
Program's not 100% accurate,

605
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:24,254
但是 没错 我非常确定
but, yeah, I'm-I'm pretty damn sure.

606
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,288
Torres
Torres,

607
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,589
Gregorio跟凶手在一起
Gregorio's up there with our killer.

608
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:27,557
我去房间
I got the room.

609
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,425
你殿后
You cover the back

610
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,793
以免她试图逃跑
in case she tries to escape.

611
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:31,928
收到
Copy.

612
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,329
Gregorio 你听到了吗
Gregorio, do you hear that?

613
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:34,864
已经确定Eva是
Got confirmation that Eva's responsible

614
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:36,466
谋杀Ferdinand的凶手
for Ferdinand's murder.

615
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:38,635
我正在赶过去 但你得马上离开那里
I'm on my way, but you need to get out of there now.

616
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:42,038
一切看起来都没问题 我会联系我的雇主
Everything seems in order. I'll reach out to my employer...

617
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,007
我知道你不是Monica Grange
I know you're not Monica Grange,

618
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:45,842
因为我今早看着她死了
because I watched her die this morning.

619
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,911
我以为可能是Victor派你来的
I thought Victor may have sent you

620
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:50,547
因为你绝对是他喜欢的类型
because you're definitely his type.

621
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:54,150
我完全不知道Victor是谁 但你要面临一个更大的问题
I don't even know who Victor is, but you got bigger problems

622
00:24:54,152 --> 00:24:56,719
因为你正用刀子指着一个联邦探员
'cause you're pointing a knife at a federal agent.

623
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,006
扔掉它
Drop it!

624
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:18,274
马上
Now!

625
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:23,246
Pride 嫌犯已经在我控制之下
Pride, I got the suspect in custody.

626
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:24,881
收到 马上就到
Copy that. Almost there.

627
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:26,282
Pride
Pride?

628
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:27,584
你是NCIS的人
You're NCIS.

629
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:29,018
没错
Yeah.

630
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,587
你因为间谍行为以及
And you're under arrest for espionage

631
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:33,089
谋杀Ferdinand Pisco和Monica Grange被捕了
and the murder of Ferdinand Pisco and Monica Grange.

632
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:35,825
你们在间谍这事上确实抓到我了 可我没杀那两个人
Well, you got me on espionage, but I didn't kill those people.

633
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,894
哦 是吗 那谁杀的
Oh, yeah? Then who did?

634
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:41,531
刚刚做了这个的人
Same person who just did that.

635
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:56,012
-你受伤了吗 -没有
- You hit? - No.

636
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,013
待在那
Stay there.

637
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,648
Gregorio
Gregorio?

638
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,050
你还好吗
You okay?

639
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:02,685
两个枪手跑出了阳台
Two gunmen went out the balcony.

640
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,554
他们拿着恐袭剧本
They have the Playbook.

641
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:07,690
Torres 两个嫌犯朝你那里去了 有武装
Torres, two suspects headed your way, armed.

642
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,227
Torres 你收到了吗
Torres, do you copy?

643
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:14,297
Torres探员现在无法回应你
Agent Torres is unable to respond.

644
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,133
你是谁
Who is this?

645
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:18,568
这是一个要跟你谈判的人
The man you'll be negotiating with

646
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,303
如果你想让Torres活着回来的话
if you want Torres back alive.

647
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:23,506
问问Eva 如果你不服从 会有什么后果
Ask Eva what happens if you don't comply.

648
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:25,675
我等你的电话
I'll expect your call.

649
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:47,077
刚跟Vance主任通完电话
Just got off the phone with Director Vance,

650
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,846
他正准备派陆战队员来救Torres回去
who's ready to send the Marines down to get Torres back.

651
00:26:49,848 --> 00:26:51,481
-我们现在掌握多少 -不太多
- What do we know? - Not much.

652
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:53,350
Torres和恐袭剧本昨晚被三个持枪者
Torres and the Playbook were taken last night

653
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:56,119
装进一辆黑色SUV 从Roosevelt酒店带走了
by three gunmen in a black SUV at the Roosevelt Hotel.

654
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:58,088
Sebastian和McGee正在尝试追踪那辆SUV的移动路线
Sebastian and McGee are trying to track the movements

655
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,757
但是看起来它就那么凭空消失了
of that SUV, but it seems like it vanished into thin air.

656
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,593
不论这个Victor是谁 他对自己做的事非常拿手
This Victor's good at what he does, whoever he is.

657
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:05,562
Eva像是明确知道他是谁
Well, Eva seems to know exactly who he is.

658
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:07,330
她昨晚像是在等他
It's like she was expecting him last night.

659
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:08,932
他可能就是第五个买家
He could be the fifth buyer,

660
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:10,800
是他杀死了其他买家
responsible for killing the others.

661
00:27:10,802 --> 00:27:12,535
是啊 昨晚在酒店里守株待兔
Yeah, laying in wait at the hotel

662
00:27:12,537 --> 00:27:14,237
等着抢走恐袭剧本
last night to grab the Playbook.

663
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:15,905
但是Ferdinand Pisco和Monica Grange被杀时
But Eva was there when Ferdinand Pisco

664
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:18,575
Eva在场 为什么
and Monica Grange were killed. Why?

665
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:21,111
这有一堆没法回答的问题
It's a lot of unanswered questions.

666
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:23,179
比如说 Torres还活着吗
Like, is Torres even still alive?

667
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:26,249
Torres还活着 因为Victor要把他当筹码
Torres is alive because Victor needs him as a bargaining chip.

668
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:27,751
好吧 没有Eva的语音识别
Well, Playbook can't be opened

669
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:29,452
恐袭剧本没法被打开
without Eva's voice verification.

670
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:32,255
Eva是那个有可能为我们
And Eva's the one person who might be able to fill in

671
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:34,357
解开谜团的人 Gregorio我们走
the rest of the blanks for us. Let's go, Gregorio.

672
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,259
继续查
Keep digging.

673
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:46,002
我希望我那位新朋友能加入我们
I was hoping that my new friend would join us.

674
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:47,937
没能知道她的真名
I didn't catch her real name.

675
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:49,806
真是太遗憾了
That's too bad.

676
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:53,009
绝对没猜到她是一名联邦探员
Never would have guessed that she was a federal agent.

677
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:55,011
而且 她打起架来 很有一手
Plus, she has a mean right hook.

678
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:57,013
我会转告她的
I'll let her know.

679
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:59,916
现在 你得告诉我Victor是谁
Right now, you need to tell me who Victor is.

680
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:02,319
俄罗斯探员
Russian agent,

681
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:04,187
恶毒的杀手
vicious assassin,

682
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:06,022
我的导师
my mentor.

683
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:09,025
我的一切都是他教的
Taught me everything I know.

684
00:28:09,027 --> 00:28:12,562
我们认为他犯下了
We think he's responsible...

685
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:14,964
这两起谋杀
for these two murders.

686
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:22,038
真是似曾相识 Eva
Here we are again, Eva.

687
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,374
是的
Yup.

688
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,876
你指控我没有犯过的罪
You're accusing me of crimes I didn't commit.

689
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:28,111
但你的确犯罪了
But you did commit a crime.

690
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:30,947
你从国土安全部偷了恐袭剧本
You stole the Playbook from Homeland.

691
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:32,549
卖给价高者
Sell to the highest bidder.

692
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:34,584
没想到你是一个投机取巧的人
Never pegged you as an opportunist.

693
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,186
你说对了
You're right.

694
00:28:36,188 --> 00:28:38,955
我本打算把这当作诱饵 引Victor出现
I was using it as bait to draw Victor out.

695
00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:40,757
你的导师
Your mentor.

696
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:44,794
他在我还是个孩子的时候招收了我
He recruited me when I was just a child.

697
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:48,698
他把我从我家里带走
He took me from my family.

698
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,935
他让我做一些 非常糟糕的事情
He made me do...terrible things.

699
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:55,071
他把我变成了这样
He turned me into this.

700
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:56,740
没有国家的女人
Woman without a country.

701
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:00,009
我看到了一个报复他的机会
I saw an opportunity to pay him back,

702
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:02,145
因为我知道他会为了恐袭剧本
'cause I knew that he would come crawling out

703
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:05,415
从藏身之处跑出来的
from under his rock if the Playbook was up for grabs.

704
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:08,151
这个诱惑太大了
It's too big a prize.

705
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:09,953
然后我就能报仇了
And then I would have justice.

706
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:14,357
你的复仇计划害死了两个人
Two people are dead because of your justice.

707
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,126
Victor拿到了恐袭剧本
Victor has the Playbook

708
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:19,095
以及我们的一名探员
and one of our agents.

709
00:29:19,097 --> 00:29:21,598
你需要我去救他回来
You need me to get him back.

710
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,266
用我去换你的探员
Trade me for your agent.

711
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:26,236
然后我们会一起抓住Victor
And we'll take Victor down together.

712
00:29:26,238 --> 00:29:30,607
问题是 你目前的表现
Well, problem is, the way you've acted...

713
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:33,309
我不知道该怎么信任你
don't know how I can afford to trust you.

714
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:37,147
你必须得相信我
How can you afford not to?

715
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:50,093
不确定能不能相信Eva说的话
Not sure we can take Eva at her word.

716
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:51,361
当然不能
I'm sure we can't.

717
00:29:51,363 --> 00:29:53,062
我知道她的那个眼神
I know that look in her eyes.

718
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:54,964
-她一意孤行想要报仇 -我懂的
- She's hell-bent on revenge. - I get it.

719
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:57,300
如果在我前夫干了那些混蛋事之后
If I had a chance to take down my ex-husband

720
00:29:57,302 --> 00:30:00,403
有机会能扳倒他 没有什么能阻止我
after all the crap he pulled, nothing would stop me.

721
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:03,640
我们得有个备用计划去救Torres 取回恐袭剧本
We need a plan B to get Torres and the Playbook back safely.

722
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:06,042
McGee和我可能有你想要的东西
McGee and I might have what you're looking for.

723
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:11,781
嘿
Hey.

724
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:13,483
-嘿 -拿到了
- Hey. - Got footage

725
00:30:13,485 --> 00:30:16,052
Victor的SUV昨晚离开酒店的监控录像
of Victor's SUV leaving the hotel late last night.

726
00:30:16,054 --> 00:30:17,921
-在那辆车消失之前么 -事实上 它没消失
- Before it disappeared into thin air? - Actually, it didn't.

727
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:19,756
SUV在逃离现场时
The SUV passed a number of cameras

728
00:30:19,758 --> 00:30:21,291
路过了一系列的摄像头
while it fled the scene.

729
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:23,159
是的 交通摄像头 安保摄像头
Yeah, traffic cameras, security cameras,

730
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:24,360
路人的个人记录仪
pedestrians' personal cameras...

731
00:30:24,362 --> 00:30:26,329
如果我们能拿到这些录像
If we can access that feed,

732
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:28,565
就能拼凑出SUV到底去哪里了
we can piece together exactly where the SUV went.

733
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:30,099
我们没有这样的资源
We don't have the resources

734
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:31,267
为了找一个单一目标
to consolidate footage from

735
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,736
去整合那么多资源
dozens of sources to find a single target.

736
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:35,872
国安局有
The NSA does.

737
00:30:35,874 --> 00:30:37,574
这案子关系到国家安全
This case involves national security

738
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:39,509
以及国际间谍
and international espionage.

739
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:42,178
我让Bishop找她的老领导帮了些忙
I asked Bishop to call in some favors from her old bosses.

740
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,880
是的 我们在这儿追踪SUV
Yeah. We track the SUV from here.

741
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:45,381
Lasalle和Percy 在我们整合情报的期间
Lasalle and Percy, they're our boots on the ground

742
00:30:45,383 --> 00:30:46,483
在外面跑腿
while we gather Intel.

743
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:47,617
我们一定会找到Torres的
We're-we're gonna find Torres.

744
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:49,085
这事儿合法嘛
How legal is this, guys?

745
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:51,554
严格地说 我们进入了一些灰色地带
Well, strictly speaking, we're entering a bit of a gray zone.

746
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:54,924
我的一个队员被一个反社会的俄罗斯探员带走了
One of my team was taken by a sociopathic Russian agent.

747
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:56,726
管它什么灰色地带
I say screw the gray zone.

748
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,729
我们同意你 McGee
We're with you, McGee.

749
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:01,831
如果这方法能救回Torres
If it'll get Torres back,

750
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,900
去做吧
get after it.

751
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:08,137
我们得给他们更多的时间
We need to buy them more time.

752
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:10,306
Victor不会无所事事坐以待毙的
No way Victor's sitting around, waiting to get caught.

753
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:12,308
在我们找他的期间 只有一个办法让Victor忙起来
Well, there's only one way to keep Victor occupied

754
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,111
我们得把Eva放出来加入游戏
while we search for him: we need to put Eva into play.

755
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:23,319
我会给Torres打电话
I'll call Torres's phone.

756
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:26,623
看我是否能和Victor联系上
See if I can make contact with Victor.

757
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:31,261
我还以为你不会打电话了呢
I was beginning to lose hope you'd ever call.

758
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:33,162
Torres探员也这么以为
So was Agent Torres.

759
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:35,064
-他还好吧 -他没事
- Is he all right? - He's fine.

760
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:37,333
我会放他回去 以交换我的特工
I'll let you have him back in return for my agent.

761
00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:40,236
你想要Eva回来的唯一原因 是要打开恐袭剧本
The only reason you want Eva back is to access the Playbook.

762
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:43,072
Torres命在旦夕的时候 这真的重要么
Does it really matter, with Torres's life on the line?

763
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:45,842
我想和他说话
I want to speak to him.

764
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:55,118
说话
Speak.

765
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:58,588
Pride
Pride.

766
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,491
你还好吧 Nick
You okay, Nick?

767
00:32:01,493 --> 00:32:03,293
这里的干墙让我起过敏反应了
Well, my allergies are acting up 'cause of all this drywall,

768
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:05,428
但从这里能看到游行队伍
but the view of the parade route from here,

769
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,830
-呃... -别给提示 Torres探员
- it's, uh... - No hints, Agent Torres.

770
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:09,165
就说你很好
Just say you're fine.

771
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,601
我很好
I'm fine.

772
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:14,237
我会发消息告知 你们把Eva带到哪里去交易
I'll send a text where to bring Eva for the trade.

773
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,905
一旦我有了她 我会告诉你们Torres在哪里
Once I have her, I'll tell you where Torres is.

774
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:17,941
不不不 我们得做一个公平的交易
No, no, no, no. We do an even trade.

775
00:32:17,943 --> 00:32:20,143
没什么条件可谈的
Terms are non-negotiable.

776
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:26,282
这事儿有五十种可能会崩
There's 50 ways this goes south.

777
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:28,985
真是乐观 我能想到一百种可能
That's optimistic. I can think about 100.

778
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,823
他想让我们
He wants us at

779
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:36,392
20分钟后去Huey P. Long桥
the Huey P. Long Bridge in 20 minutes.

780
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:46,636
不要耍花招 按着计划来
Keep this very simple, and you don't go off book.

781
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:47,837
明白吗
Understand?

782
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,505
Victor不会按计划来的
Victor's gonna go off book.

783
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:51,541
他会背叛你们 这是他会做的事情
He's gonna double-cross you. That's what he does.

784
00:32:51,543 --> 00:32:54,510
是啊 所以我们有这追踪装置
Yeah, well, that's why we have the tracking device.

785
00:32:54,512 --> 00:32:56,779
密切监视Victor
Keep tabs on Victor.

786
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:58,414
我还以为 你只是
Here I was thinking you were just

787
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:00,717
为非礼我找了个借口
looking for an excuse to get fresh.

788
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,518
Lasalle 有新消息吗
<i>Lasalle, what's the update?</i>

789
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,154
有好消息也有坏消息
Good news and bad news.

790
00:33:05,156 --> 00:33:06,656
Sebastian和McGee找到了
Sebastian and McGee were able to track down

791
00:33:06,658 --> 00:33:09,258
Victor的SUV的最终位置
Victor's SUV till its final destination.

792
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,793
-你看到了 -是的
- You got eyes on it? - Yeah.

793
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:13,463
它停在市中心一栋废弃大厦的外面
It's parked outside an abandoned building in the CBD.

794
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:14,631
坏消息是啥
Bad news?

795
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,599
大厦有30层高
Well, the building's 30 stories tall.

796
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:18,568
Torres可能在里边 也可能不在
Torres might be inside, and he might not.

797
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,937
在不惊动俄罗斯人的情况下 得费些时间去搜查
It's gonna take time to search without alerting the Russians.

798
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:23,673
没错 但我们没什么时间了
Yeah, well, time's something we're running out of.

799
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:25,742
开始找吧
Start searching.

800
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,646
我对这事不是很有信心
I don't know about all this.

801
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:31,948
什么 你害怕抓捕那些可能武装到牙齿的
What, you worried about taking on some Russian spies

802
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,650
俄罗斯间谍么
who are probably armed to the teeth?

803
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:35,885
不 但我讨厌台阶 看来我们
No. But I hate stairs, and looks like we're about

804
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:37,754
得爬好多节楼梯
to take on a crapload of them.

805
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:45,528
让Eva一个人过来
Send Eva alone.

806
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,564
你们俩站在原地
Two of you stay where you are.

807
00:33:50,802 --> 00:33:52,301
按他说的做
Do what he says.

808
00:33:52,303 --> 00:33:54,103
做好干掉他的准备
Be ready to take him out.

809
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:56,539
你会没事的
You'll be okay.

810
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,227
Eva 好久不见
Eva, it's been too long.

811
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:19,462
该我们了
Our turn now!

812
00:34:19,464 --> 00:34:21,264
Torres在哪里
Where's Torres?

813
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:24,133
我们安全离开后 我会发短信告诉你们地址
Once we're safely away, I'll text you the address.

814
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:27,003
迫不及待想见你了
Can't wait to catch up with you.

815
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,071
注意你的行为
Play your cards right,

816
00:34:28,073 --> 00:34:29,972
你刚从这混乱中幸存下来
you just might survive this mess.

817
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:33,076
但你不会 Victor
But you will not, Victor.

818
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:43,086
你刚才到底做了什么
What the hell did you just do?

819
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:45,588
做了我一直想做的事
Something I've been waiting for a long time.

820
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,923
你刚杀了唯一一个
You just killed the one person

821
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:48,825
能帮我们找回Torres的人
who could help us get Torres back.

822
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:10,475
你耍了我们 Eva
You really screwed us here, Eva.

823
00:35:10,883 --> 00:35:12,583
Victor的手下正在等他的电话
Victor's guys are waiting for his call.

824
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:13,984
现在他们会杀Torres的
Now they'll kill Torres.

825
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,520
他迟早会杀了Torres的 我刚才帮了你们
He would've killed Torres anyway. I did you a favor.

826
00:35:16,522 --> 00:35:18,455
-怎么会 -我帮你们拖延了时间
- How's that? - I bought you time.

827
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:19,590
一旦我们离开
He would've slit

828
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:21,658
他会立即割掉你们探员的喉咙
your agent's throat the minute we pulled away.

829
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,227
等等 Lasalle和Sonja已经接近
Wait, Lasalle and Sonja are already

830
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:25,195
Victor的藏身点了 我们得联系他们
near Victor's hideout. We need to call them

831
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:28,265
给他们具体地址 这样他们才能救出Torres
and give them the exact location so they can rescue Torres.

832
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:29,733
我有个主意
I got an idea.

833
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:31,535
但我们还得让她帮忙
But we're gonna need her help again.

834
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:39,035
Victor 怎么花了这么长时间

835
00:35:39,035 --> 00:35:41,035
我是Eva Azareva

836
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:44,035
你们需要转移NCIS探员

837
00:35:48,035 --> 00:35:50,035
Victor呢

838
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:53,035
如果他现在能说话 他会的

839
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:55,492
她在拖延 但这不是长久之计
She's stalling, but it's not gonna work for long.

840
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:56,593
你有什么发现
What do you got?

841
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:59,196
我追踪到了俄罗斯人的手机
I have a trace on the Russian's cell.

842
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,397
好了 正在连接GPS
All right. Connecting to the GPS.

843
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:03,167
正在获取具体坐标
Getting the exact coordinates now.

844
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,770
找到了 精确的位置 伙计们
There it is. Bull's-eye. Guys!

845
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:09,406
-伙计们 我们有发现 -好的 Sebastian
- Guys, we got a hit! - Okay, Sebastian.

846
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:10,507
告诉我们在哪里
Tell us where.

847
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:12,209
请你小点声告诉我们
And tell us softly, please.

848
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,544
17层
17th floor.

849
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,578
东北侧
Northeast side.

850
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:43,540
你没事吧
You good?

851
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:45,409
我没事
I'm good.

852
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:49,113
怎么这么久才来
What took you so long?

853
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:51,181
你是真的知道
You do realize it was, like,

854
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:53,717
17层有很多很多台阶的 对吗
17 freakin' flights of stairs, right?

855
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:56,587
你知道我已经制服他了 对吗
You know I had him, right?

856
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,088
是啊 你绝对制服他了
Oh, yeah, you definitely had him.

857
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,491
一般人在这时候不是应该说谢谢吗
Don't people usually just say thank you?

858
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:02,426
哦 不客气
Oh, you're welcome.

859
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,495
我们是不是应该让他继续绑着
Should we leave him tied up?

860
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:06,029
是
Yes.

861
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:19,143
特别探员Torres
Special Agent Torres.

862
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:21,845
很高兴看到你在考验中存活下来了
Glad to see you survived your ordeal.

863
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:24,748
成功让你自己参与到游戏中
Managed to get yourself in the game.

864
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,417
我说了我讨厌坐在替补席上
I told you I hate riding the bench.

865
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:31,021
你干得也不错呀
You did good, too.

866
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:33,323
对新人来说确实不错 对吧
Not bad for a couple of new guys, right?

867
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:35,359
这虽然不像在厄瓜多尔的监狱里待半年
Well, it's not six months in an Ecuadorian prison

868
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:38,061
只是为了做好身份 不过
just to set up cover, but, uh,

869
00:37:38,063 --> 00:37:40,230
的确不赖
yeah, not bad.

870
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:49,306
我五分钟后出发
Shoving off in five.

871
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:59,483
美丽的夜晚
Beautiful night.

872
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,852
-你会有一段时间看不到了 -是啊
- It'll be your last for a while. - Right.

873
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:04,555
联邦监狱里没有很多夜间生活
They don't have a lot of night activities in federal prison.

874
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:06,156
是啊 在你冒险以前
Yeah, well, you should've thought about that

875
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,524
应该考虑到这点才是
before your little adventure.

876
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:09,726
信不信由你 这和我想的结局
Believe it or not, this is exactly how I thought

877
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:11,128
一模一样
it would all end.

878
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,996
一切都很值得
And it was completely worth it.

879
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:16,233
报复值得终身入狱吗
Getting revenge was worth a lifetime in prison?

880
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:19,603
能遇见你也很棒
Meeting you was nice, too.

881
00:38:19,605 --> 00:38:21,038
真遗憾我们不能
Too bad we won't be able to get

882
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,639
有机会深入了解对方
to know each other a little better...

883
00:38:27,546 --> 00:38:30,013
永不说不
Never say never.

884
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:46,597
你确定要走吗 你会错过狂欢节的
You sure you got to go? You're gonna miss Mardi Gras.

885
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,632
-现在不就是狂欢节吗 -不 不是
- Hasn't this been Mardi Gras? - No, no, no, no.

869
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:50,300
这只是狂欢节的前奏
This has been the lead-up to Mardi Gras.

886
00:38:50,302 --> 00:38:52,936
真正的狂欢节是整座城市都在狂欢
Actual Mardi Gras day is when the city really goes off.

887
00:38:52,938 --> 00:38:55,272
哦 你知道 我觉得我已经领教
Oh. You know what, I think I've had my share

888
00:38:55,274 --> 00:38:57,007
新奥尔良的把戏了
of New Orleans shenanigans.

889
00:38:57,009 --> 00:38:59,643
-或许明年吧 -嗯
- Maybe next year. - Mm.

890
00:38:59,645 --> 00:39:01,578
呃
Uh...

891
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,049
你觉得我可不可以 偶尔打给你
you think it's okay if maybe I call you from time to time?

892
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:07,818
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

893
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,420
你刚才问我的方式 有点儿别扭
The way you, uh, just asked me made it sound a little weird.

894
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:13,190
是这样 我可能会需要一些建议
Well, you know, I just, I might need some advice.

895
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:15,592
获得未来Sebastian的智慧
Get Future Sebastian's wisdom.

896
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:18,262
好吧 但你不要再叫我未来Sebastian了
Okay. But you got to stop calling me Future Sebastian.

897
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:20,530
事实是 你是过去的McGee
The fact is, you are Past McGee.

898
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,599
并且你做得非常棒
And doing a real good job of it.

899
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:25,269
原来你在这里 McGee
Ah, there you are, McGee.

900
00:39:25,271 --> 00:39:27,804
我刚去车里给Torres送了点吃的
I just dropped some food off with Torres in the car.

901
00:39:27,806 --> 00:39:30,007
-路上可以吃的点心 -非常感谢 谢谢
- A little snack for the road. - Oh, appreciate that. Thank you.

902
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:32,643
不客气 听着 好好看着Eva
Pleasure. Listen, keep an eye on Eva, okay?

903
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:34,778
-她可狡猾了 -没问题
- She's tricky. - You got it.

904
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,680
-Jethro -特别探员Pride
- Jethro. - Special Agent Pride.

905
00:39:36,682 --> 00:39:39,516
你应该会很高兴 我把你的队员
You'll be happy to know I'm sending your team home

906
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:41,952
基本上完好无损地送回去
mostly in one piece.

907
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:44,588
你们靠自己的力量搞定了 不赖嘛
Eh, you pulled it off on your own. Not bad.

908
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,424
我很高兴 我们没让华盛顿的人
I'm just glad we kept all of official Washington

909
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,659
涌入这个城市
from flooding the city.

910
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:50,394
是的 至少这次是这样
Yeah. This time, at least.

911
00:39:50,396 --> 00:39:52,496
保持这样吧 你觉得呢
Well, let's keep it that way. What do you say?

912
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:54,798
当然啦 除非是一次私下拜访
Unless, of course, it's for a social visit.

913
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,501
下次会有别的派对
Next time there's another party,

914
00:39:57,503 --> 00:40:00,637
我可能会直接出现在你面前 给你个惊喜 Dwayne
I might just pop down, surprise you, Dwayne.

915
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,606
这是新奥尔良 兄弟
This is New Orleans, my brother.

916
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,574
各种派对从来不会停
There's always another party going on.
