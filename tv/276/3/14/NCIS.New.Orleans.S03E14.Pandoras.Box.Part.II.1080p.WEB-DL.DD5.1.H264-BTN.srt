Claimed he was NCIS,
but no credentials.

46
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,159
Said he was working
undercover.

47
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,461
I had to take him
into custody.

48
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,729
             Is he one of yours?

49
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,431
                So they tell me.

50
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,766
               You did the right
            thing, Pete. Thanks.

51
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:15,834
Mm-hmm.

52
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,271
             Pride.

53
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,739
       We met over MTAC.

54
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,341
Nick Torres.

55
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,676
          You make quite a first
        impression, Nick Torres.

56
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,513
Less than two hours in my city,
 and you get yourself arrested

57
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,715
    as a suspected murderer.

58
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,451
  (whistles) That's got to be
      some kind of record.

59
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:33,819
           (chuckles)

60
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,387
     I got an explanation.

61
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,889
         Yeah, you and
      Special Agent McGee

62
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,391
    were sent to New Orleans
 to recover stolen intel, yes?

63
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,326
Yes. It's called
the Playbook.

64
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,594
It's a collection of scenarios

65
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,329
for viable terrorist attacks
against the U.S.

66
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,599
  Stolen from Homeland Security.
          I... That much I know.

67
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,335
        What I don't know is why
            you ran an operation

68
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,371
                without checking
                       in first.

69
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,640
Tracking down a former contact
of my undercover days.

70
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:55,874
That would be the murder victim.

71
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,410
        Ferdinand Pisco.
     Venezuelan operative.

72
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,746
        Uh, he's in town
    to acquire the Playbook.

73
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,814
Had to handle it, um...

74
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,349
          delicately.

75
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,884
                     Ah.

76
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,654
           That word must have a
    different meaning up in D.C.

77
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,490
               But down here, in
     New Orleans, at Mardi Gras,

78
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,359
       NCIS likes to keep
        a lower profile.

79
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,795
     Pride, I was supposed
   to check in. That's on me.

80
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,830
         But all I did
      was follow the guy.

81
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,667
    Someone else killed him.

82
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,935
     Probably to make sure

83
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:24,803
        Ferdinand didn't
       get the Playbook.

84
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:25,904
           Probably.

85
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,206
                         Mm-hmm.

86
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,209
    We have to find out who.

87
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,411
           And here's
    a silly question-- um...

88
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,947
you think you could take these,
uh, handcuffs off me now?

89
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,216
      Haven't decided yet.

90
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:38,884
    Pride, I'm telling you,

91
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,587
    my second impression is
 so much better than the first.

92
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,523
       One can only hope.

93
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:48,827
                        Loretta.

94
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,295
            Dwayne.

95
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,998
             This is not exactly
         how I expected to spend

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,600
 the weekend before Mardi Gras.

97
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,668
       Imagine it wasn't
      how Ferdinand Pisco

98
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,737
                     expected it
                would go either.

99
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,306
 I don't think he even realized
         he was injured

100
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,991
until it was too late.

101
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,675
It's a single stab wound,
as far as I can tell.

102
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,712
Maximum damage in minimum time.

103
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,413
    Anything on the killer?
             GREGORIO: Oh, yeah.

104
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,249
  Spoke to multiple witnesses

105
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,683
who positively I.D.'d
the suspect.

106
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,586
         Unfortunately,
    they all described him.

107
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,724
  Nick Torres. How you doing?

108
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,792
         I'm Gregorio.
 I'd be better if you had more

109
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,495
on the murder suspect than just
 "wearing a harlequin costume."

110
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,830
        So embarrassing.
         I had no idea

111
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,498
       that was a common
    fashion statement here.

112
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,933
Krewe of Commedia.

113
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,268
         They had their
       annual party here.

114
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,902
     Uh, crew of what now?

115
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,338
    It's a New Orleans thing
    I'm still not clear on.

116
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,673
It means there were
over a hundred Harlequins

117
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,642
dressed like that last night.

118
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,610
  NOPD's interviewing as many
     as they can round up.

119
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,346
Anyone who can kill like this
had an escape route--

120
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,881
                      long gone.

121
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,350
   Oh, man, that's so gross.

122
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,818
 What you got there, Sebastian?

123
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,321
Victim's cell phone.
And probably a case of hep C,

124
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,822
considering this gutter
I just pulled it out of.

125
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,291
   I'm gonna need to go home
        and take, like,

126
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,725
    a long Silkwood shower.

127
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,695
      Looks water damaged.
   Can you retrieve the data?

128
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,597
      Oh, yeah, I'm on it.

129
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,965
           Gregorio,

130
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,400
             check surveillance.
          We need something more

131
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,669
on our killer
other than he looks like

132
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,803
Torres here.

133
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,905
            Mm-hmm.
                   So, Ferdinand

134
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,574
was here to meet up with
whoever stole the Playbook.

135
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,443
Any update on who that might be?

136
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,978
         That would be
      McGee's department.

137
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,447
         Where's McGee?

138
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,582
     It is absolutely crazy
           out there.

139
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,017
(Sonja laughs)

140
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,451
LASALLE: Agent McGee,
finally in New Orleans.

141
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:21,754
         How you doing?

142
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,055
And your first Mardi Gras
in the quarter.

143
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,590
I see you've already caught on
to the New Orleans vibe.

144
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,092
Day drinking is step one.

145
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,527
    I-I am not day drinking.

146
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,761
      Someone forced this
         into my hand.

147
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,663
Yeah, if you say so,
glitter boo.

148
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,598
(laughs)
                  I do, uh, come
         bearing gifts, however.

149
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
    Can I use your computer?

150
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,968
          Absolutely.

151
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,438
Been tracking the digital trail
of whoever stole the Playbook

152
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,006
in the first place.

153
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,008
        They've been making some
     moves the last couple days.

154
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,810
       Yeah? What kind of moves?

155
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,079
             McGEE:
  NSA's had an uptick in their
  chatter about the Playbook.

156
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,448
             Thief is putting it
                 up for auction.

157
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,716
               It's going to the
                 highest bidder.

158
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,651
             SONJA:
     So multiple bad actors

159
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,520
    from all over the globe
     trying to make a bid.

160
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,722
                  Timothy McGee.

161
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,824
          Make yourself at home.
              Hey.

162
00:05:58,826 --> 00:05:59,958
How are you?
             Good.

163
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,126
            Morning.

164
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,611
 So, New Orleans at Mardi Gras

165
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,095
is perfect
for an auction like this.

166
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,497
                Million visitors
                    in the city,

167
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,865
     half of them in masks.

168
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,067
    Easy to slip in and out
      without being seen.

169
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,635
        Well, then let's
        hit the streets.

170
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,404
 Let's get that Playbook back.

171
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:15,841
Uh, you're not hitting anything
       after last night.

172
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,443
       Hey, I took initiative to
        contact Ferdinand Pisco.
                 (phone ringing)

173
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,978
          I'm not the reason the
            operation went sour.

174
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,047
        I'm not the one
     you need to convince.

175
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,582
           Hey, boss.

176
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,417
             Yeah.

177
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,386
                He's right here.

178
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,454
Actually, he wants
to talk to Pride.

179
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,657
Are you holding up okay, Dwayne?

180
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,059
Wish Homeland's mess

181
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,161
hadn't ended up in our backyard,
         but we'll deal with it.

182
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,163
      Got backup available
        if you want it.

183
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,698
       More agents means
        more questions.

184
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,733
 I want to keep this contained.

185
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,169
  That's gonna be hard to do.
  We've got a rogue's gallery

186
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,505
  of international operatives
   descending on New Orleans.

187
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,873
 Every agency in D.C. wants in.

188
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,541
I just got through

189
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,943
         hand-holding the FBI on
         the Javier Garcia case.

190
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,445
            Don't need a sequel.

191
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,980
          Roger that.
     I'll run interference.

192
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,548
          Appreciate it, Jethro.

193
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,017
        You always had a gentler
             way with the suits.

194
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,419
(laughs)

195
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,588
   Sorry, that wasn't a joke?

196
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,023
        Send Torres in.

197
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,725
        We need to talk.

198
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:07,826
       You got it, boss.

199
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,561
             McGee.
          Yeah, boss?

200
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,862
 What is that around your neck?

201
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:14,065
Oh, uh, they're beads.
It's a festive thing.

202
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,834
                   Trying to get
                      into the--

203
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,169
          Never mind.

204
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,638
          Wrong door.

205
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,008
        (scanner beeps)

206
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,545
           (chuckles)

207
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,946
 So I was able to retrieve data

208
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,514
    off of Ferdinand Pisco's
       busted cell phone.

209
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,082
What'd you get?
             Texts.

210
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,084
   He was, uh, communicating
with whoever stole the Playbook.

211
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,053
   They were supposed to meet
        in the Quarter.

212
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,989
      Yeah, someone killed Pisco
  before the meeting took place.

213
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,891
Well, able to get us
anything on Pisco

214
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,726
or the thief from the texts?
              No.

215
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,162
  But I was able to trace the
 serial number from the phone,

216
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,164
       and it was one of
       five burner phones

217
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,568
     purchased together at
an airport kiosk a few days ago.

218
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,670
          Five phones
     can mean five buyers.
All we have to do

219
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,172
        is track the phones, and
         we find all the buyers.

220
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,874
      Tracking the phones
        isn't that easy.

221
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,677
Can't you just trace the ping
from the cellular towers

222
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,479
and triangulate or whatever?

223
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,614
                   No, it's-it's
                2017 now, Sonja.

224
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,483
             The era of the ping
                   is long gone.

225
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,585
        Even cheap burner phones
                are GPS enabled.

226
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,987
       You know, the real
 GPS tracking expert is Patton,

227
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,190
  and he's off consulting JSOC
 on some online security issue.

228
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,559
              Hey, you know, uh,
           I don't mean to brag,

229
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,028
   but I wrote an algorithm that
       is kind of a game changer

230
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,730
           in satellite circles.

231
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,265
             Geez.
You're...

232
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,134
you're, uh...
you're McGee, right?

233
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,703
                 Uh, yeah, yeah.

234
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,838
      Yeah. I'm Sebastian.
I-I've heard so much about you.

235
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,573
                   Oh, you have?

236
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,909
Well, you went from tech support
to special agent overnight.

237
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,777
Sort of a legend at FLETC.

238
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:33,912
      At least, you know, to me.

239
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:34,980
                    It-it wasn't
              quite that simple.

240
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,815
               But, uh, this is.
Oh.

241
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,750
     Let me show you this.
     All you need to do is

242
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,552
       enter the serial numbers.

243
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:41,887
            (typing)

244
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,289
       (computer beeping)

245
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,726
Whoa, this is,
this is amazing.

246
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:50,529
There's no way that this is,
uh, a rigid tracking algorithm.

247
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,230
    No, no, no. Rigid tracking's
       no good. Satellite phones

248
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,832
are always on the move,
so this is

249
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,101
                a geosynchronous
          step track processing,

250
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,702
            with a little bit of
            pizzazz on the side.
Of course.

251
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,904
Yeah, makes total sense.

252
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,138
(chuckles) To who?

253
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,840
        (computer beeps)

254
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,543
Oh, wait. One of the burner
phones just powered on.

255
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,044
Somewhere near
Armstrong Park.

256
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,013
I'm getting the exact
coordinates now.
             Nice.

257
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,918
(band playing lively jazz music)

258
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,827
           Got a lot of tourists
          and a bunch of drunks.

259
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,162
                    Not sure who
              we're looking for.

260
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,164
Any clues to help us out,
Sebastian?

261
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,667
 SEBASTIAN: All I can tell you
    is that whoever is using

262
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,835
       that burner phone
 is actively texting right now.

263
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,205
                   Well, think I
                 see our target.

264
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,309
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to turn around,

265
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,977
put your hands in the air!

266
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,845
            (grunts)

267
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:45,717
          She's dead.

268
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,953
Stabbed just like Pisco.

269
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,655
It just happened.

270
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,991
               Yeah, and whoever
           did it was just here.

271
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,905
(band playing lively jazz music)

272
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,610
According to DNA,
this is Monica Grange.

273
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,112
U.S. citizen traveling
under a Canadian alias.

274
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,880
Wanted in four
different countries

275
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,882
for ties to a Syrian
terrorist group.

276
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,619
    Yeah, been off the grid
for years acting as a middleman,

277
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,754
     buying weapons, intel,
          explosives.

278
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,055
                Probably in town

279
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,924
    to bid for the Playbook,
      just like Ferdinand.

280
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,258
And just like Ferdinand,

281
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,060
          she got stabbed before
          she could make contact

282
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,762
     with whoever the seller is.

283
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,765
Two operatives in town
murdered within a day.

284
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,167
Killer could be another buyer
taking out the competition.

285
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,137
Easier to negotiate
if everyone else is dead.

286
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,072
       Well, Sebastian and McGee
               are tracking down

287
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,174
            the remaining burner
              phones and buyers.

288
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,877
          GREGORIO: Well, as for
       our killer, all we got is

289
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,147
     footage of the suspect
    running away last night.

290
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,883
    PRIDE: So how do we get
       the Playbook back?

291
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,652
Talk to me.

292
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,420
Monica Grange was corresponding
with the killer before she died.

293
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,888
              They were supposed
                to meet tonight.

294
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,089
                 TORRES: We have
                 Monica's phone.

295
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,058
        I have a clean identity.
                  Set up a meet.

296
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,693
                      I'll go in
                   in her place.

297
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,294
Seller's proven to be careful--
         not gonna have

298
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,063
      the Playbook on him
        at the meeting.

299
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:08,099
  Anyone but a woman shows up,
      seller could spook.

300
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,801
Well, what if I go in as Monica?

301
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,437
I mean, she's been off the grid,
       no current photo.

302
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,706
Seller will have no idea.

303
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,940
  Seller will have every idea.

304
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,842
I'm sorry, but you reek of cop.

305
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,778
   You trying to say I smell?
No, I'm saying

306
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,680
      that undercover work
     takes a certain flair.

307
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,915
  Like the flair you had last
  night when you got arrested?

308
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,216
Oh, really? We're gonna do that?
         (phone beeps)

309
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,785
Look, all I'm trying
to say is

310
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,787
       if we want to get
   the Playbook back<i> quietly,</i>

311
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,088
then I'm your girl.

312
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,690
Gregorio's right.

313
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,124
   Study up on Monica Grange

314
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,693
until the seller
reaches out.

315
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,728
    I got to go to autopsy.

316
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,133
   What'd you find, Loretta?

317
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,869
               (sighs) Frightful
           symmetry, I'm afraid.

318
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,206
      Both victims killed with a
 single stab between the ribs...

319
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,143
    ...puncturing the heart,
    bled out within moments.

320
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,845
  Probably didn't even realize
       they were stabbed

321
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,113
    before it was too late.

322
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,114
  The weapon was thin-bladed.

323
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,982
Stiletto, most likely.

324
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,485
 Killer's a skilled expert who
 can slip in and out of a crowd

325
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,721
     without being noticed.
        Yeah, no sign of fibers,

326
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,122
       DNA, fingerprints.

327
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,390
  Trained intelligence agent?

328
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,958
        Or an assassin.

329
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,160
     Whoever the killer is,
  we need to contain him now.

330
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,262
A highly skilled assassin

331
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,865
      roaming the streets
 of New Orleans at Mardi Gras.

332
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,333
            Dwayne.

333
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,837
        Maybe it's time
    to call in the cavalry.

334
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,005
   Well, if we do that, it won't
         just be the FBI coming.

335
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,141
                    Be CIA, too.
   Yeah, and those guys suck.

336
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,976
Yeah, it'll be like
the Wild West.

337
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,311
       (monitor beeping)

338
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,279
     Can't let that happen.
           Sebastian,

339
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,148
                 tell me you got
                      good news.

340
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,016
 McGee and I were able to hack
 the last three burner phones.

341
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,885
              Means we can track
                their locations.

342
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,386
          Yeah, well,
  we can do better than that.

343
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,021
        We're gonna draw
       the buyers to us.

344
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,758
    Send them text messages,
  pretending to be the seller,

345
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,994
      then sweep them up--
 classic false flag operation.

346
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,063
    And what does that mean,
            exactly?

347
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,765
        I have no idea--
   something that McGee said.

348
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,999
   But it sounds really cool,
             right?

349
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,068
PRIDE:
Chris, Sonja,

350
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,437
help McGee and Sebastian
bring in the buyers.

351
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,273
 And remember, any one of them
      could be our killer.

352
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,041
      Need you to proceed
         with caution.

353
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,810
                     You got it.

354
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,079
            TORRES:
      That's the entirety

355
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,447
       of Interpol's file
       on Monica Grange.

356
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,915
        It's barely a page long.

357
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,283
It'll have to do.

358
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,051
                  She's a lawyer
                  by profession,

359
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,953
 so you're gonna have to pretend
        like you understand law.

360
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,122
Don't need to pretend.

361
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,290
   I am a lawyer; went to law
 school before joining the FBI.

362
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,794
         She's fluent in Arabic.

363
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,029
        I'm assuming you're not.

364
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,964
No, but I dated

365
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,168
        an Egyptian once
  and learned a phrase or two.

366
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,903
 You know, you're pretty cocky

367
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,905
       for someone that's
never worked undercover before.

368
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,907
                 Oh, I've worked
          undercover ops before.

369
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,376
Yeah, well, I'm not talking
about a couple of days

370
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,111
of playing make-believe,

371
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,814
    take down a drug dealer.

372
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,248
I'm talking about

373
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,485
         spending years
     being another person.

374
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,222
      So long that you...
           (chuckles)

375
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,090
 you forget who you really are.

376
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,959
          (whispers):
          Fascinating.

377
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:51,095
But all I need is an hour or two
to get the Playbook back, so...

378
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,997
        And all you need
      is to screw up once,

379
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,999
and this entire situation
goes pear-shaped.

380
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,235
             You know, I may not
            be fluent in Arabic,

381
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,103
                 but I am fluent
               in body language,

382
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:02,106
            and it's killing you
              to ride the bench.

383
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,043
        It's killing me
       to ride the bench.

384
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,380
You know, I'm not a bench guy;
I'm an on-the-field kind of guy.

385
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,849
                   Not much of a
               team player, huh?

386
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,351
        No, this, uh...

387
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,020
           team thing
    has been pretty recent.

388
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,555
             It's an adjustment.

389
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,089
    I get it. It's not easy
       being the new guy

390
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,525
      with a group that's
    worked so long together.

391
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,360
         Yeah, I mean,
     inside jokes alone...

392
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,262
     Yeah, and you're never
      fully confident that

393
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,564
 they actually need you, right?
  It's, like, what am I doing?

394
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,166
            Exactly.

395
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,534
   Well, I'm gonna need you,
            Torres,

396
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,402
         'cause I have
    no idea what I'm doing.

397
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,037
   So let's just start there,
           all right?

398
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,974
         (phone beeps)

399
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,877
                It's the seller.

400
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,011
Meeting's at 8:00.

401
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,246
          Sazerac Bar.

402
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,047
      I'll let Pride know.

403
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,216
   (mid-tempo music playing)

404
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,460
Not gonna want
to do that, Sebastian.

405
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,896
Keep your eyes forward
or on me.

406
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,564
   Well, how-how will we know
    when the target's here?

407
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,899
      Window reflections.

408
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,201
                  Got a security
                mirror up there.

409
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:06,537
There's about five other ways to
know what's going on behind us.

410
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,673
   What, I still got glitter
          in my hair?

411
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:09,674
                             No.

412
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,476
 Well, yeah, but that's not it.

413
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,544
                   You're a nerd
              like me, you know?

414
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,546
               But you're, like,
               this badass nerd.

415
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,282
         You're so good at this.

416
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,050
Eh. Just have more experience.

417
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,585
 No, you-you make it look easy.

418
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,587
                     I just keep
                     messing up.

419
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,222
            Look...

420
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,225
      when I was a probie,
   I messed up all the time.

421
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,927
Okay? I made a ton
of mistakes.

422
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,929
But I was fortunate;
I had some key mentors

423
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,463
that showed me the ropes.

424
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,699
Well, they must have been very
  patient and forgiving, then.

425
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,334
They were merciless.
Downright mean sometimes.

426
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,702
But you know what?

427
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,171
    They always had my six,
    and I always had theirs.

428
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,639
         (phone beeps)

429
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:44,509
                   Buyer's here.

430
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,079
                The windbreaker,
                     duck boots.

431
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,215
All right.

432
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,350
All right, I'll send him out
to the alley away from everyone,

433
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,385
so we can pick him up there.
                      All right.

434
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,120
All right, you zig, I zag.
         What, now? What's that?

435
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,356
Follow him.
          Okay, yeah, all right.

436
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,426
     (lively music playing)

437
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,477
           Hi. Uh...

438
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,712
I'm a federal agent...

439
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,317
      Stop-stop resisting.

440
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,653
                 Stop resisting.
             It's gonna be okay.

441
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,054
            Just...
          (man grunts)

442
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,190
        We're all gonna be fine.

443
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,096
      (Sebastian groaning)

444

It means you're not

00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,696
  Might have an issue, Torres.

496

             stole the Playbook.

504
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,256
             Good.

505
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,692
          Eva Azarova?

506
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,528
   I thought we put her away
    last year for espionage.

507
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,330
        Yeah. Guess she escaped,
       somehow got the Playbook.

508
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,698
                Now she's trying
                     to sell it.

509
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,200
        Gregorio's made contact.

510
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,701
            Well, hopefully, she
          gets the Playbook back

00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,203

                 else gets hurt.

512
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,604
   Yeah. Meanwhile, we've got

513
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,406
      two out of the three
   foreign buyers in custody.

514
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,741
   Though ours isn't talking.

515
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,610
LASALLE:
Yeah, North Korean operative.

516
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,879

 understand a word we're saying,

00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,747
      smiling and nodding.

518
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:17,982
 You guys have any better luck?

519
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,550
     No. Although, oh, man,

520
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,952
    you guys should've been
        in interrogation

521
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,954
    to see McGee go to work.

522
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,422
               He did this whole
                no-talking thing

523
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:25,623
                 that completely
            freaked our guy out.

524
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,425
I mean, he ended up
telling us his entire

525
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,961
life story just
to get McGee to speak.

526
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,896
            So cool.

527
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,364
             What?

528
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,299
     You really like McGee,
           don't you?

529
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,335
   Yeah, bit of a man crush,
          you ask me.

530
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,503
                    It's a total
                man crush, yeah.

531
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,906
         Also, it's like looking
             into a crystal ball

532
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,641
             to see what I could
             potentially become.

533
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,377
   You know? I mean, McGee is
  basically future Sebastian.

534
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,912
         Well, where's
     future Sebastian now?

535
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,648
 He's in Patton's office trying
to track the final burner phone.

536
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,916
         No luck so far, though.

537
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,918
                  It hasn't even
                 been turned on.

538
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,487
 Well, two of the other buyers
         were murdered,

539
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,589
      so maybe whoever has
 the other phone is dead, too.

540
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,425
SONJA:
Or he could be

541
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,260
    the killer, take out the
 competition for the Playbook.

542
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,894
                        LASALLE:
               Well, all we know

543
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,364
about the killer is that he was
 wearing a Mardi Gras costume,

544
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,399
  and he's good with a knife.
     I mean, we need more.

545
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,534
Well, that's what
I've been working on.

546
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:13,371
So, we have about ten seconds
of surveillance video

547
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,772
from the night
Ferdinand Pisco was killed.

548
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,374
I'm using a special
computer program

549
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,342
to analyze
the suspect's gait--

550
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,777
     stride length, height,
         measurements.

551
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,413
  It can even predict gender.
Is this for real?

552
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,949
I'm gonna cross-check the
results against our database,

553
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,784
           and hopefully come up
          with a viable suspect.

554
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,552
Yeah, well, keep at it,

00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,620

00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:18,028
      PRIDE: Tenth floor,
    east side of the hotel.

594
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,598
       You say the word,
        I'm on the move.

595
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,136
     I didn't book the room
      because of the view.

596
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,605
    Balcony gives me access
          to the roof.

597
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,839
                    Escape route
                   if I need it.

598
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,976
     Paranoid way of life.

599
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,912
Only way to survive in our line.

600
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,480
      Gets tiring, though.

601
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,948
                      Why do it?

602
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,917
      I've got my reasons.

603
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,485
            Here's the Playbook.

604
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:44,422
   Voice activation security
        needs my voice.

605
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,557
       (speaking Russian)

606
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,859
       (computer beeping)

607
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,563
                    Have a look.

608
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:02,072
        (phone ringing)

609
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,908
           Sebastian.
       SEBASTIAN: Pride.

610
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,043
 I just got a hit back on that
  gait analysis I was running.

611
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,645
     What's gait analysis?

612
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,113
      It's too complicated
     to explain right now.

613
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,949
  Bottom line, we got an I.D.
     on our murder suspect.

614
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,984
     Eva Azarova came back
          as a match.

615
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,519
         Are you sure?

616
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:16,821
  Program's not 100% accurate,

617
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,122
           but, yeah,
   I'm-I'm pretty damn sure.

618
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,190
            Torres,

619
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,591
      Gregorio's up there
        with our killer.

620
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,592
        I got the room.

621
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,461
       You cover the back

622
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,795
  in case she tries to escape.

623
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,863
            TORRES:
             Copy.

624
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,231
  Gregorio, do you hear that?

625
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,799
        Got confirmation
     that Eva's responsible

626
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,534
    for Ferdinand's murder.

627
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,670
  I'm on my way, but you need
    to get out of there now.

628
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:36,006
      Everything seems in order.
I'll reach out to my employer...

629
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,008
               I know you're not
                  Monica Grange,

630
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,844
           because I watched her
               die this morning.

631
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,879
                I thought Victor
               may have sent you

632
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:44,615
                  because you're
            definitely his type.

633
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:48,152
I don't even know who Victor is,
  but you got bigger problems

634
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,621
     'cause you're pointing
  a knife at a federal agent.

635
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:10,908
            Drop it!

636
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,076
                            Now!

637
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,179
           (panting)

638
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,181
    Pride, I got the suspect
          in custody.

639
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,849
             PRIDE:
    Copy that. Almost there.

640
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,184
             Pride?

641
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,619
          You're NCIS.

642
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:22,987
             Yeah.

643
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,655
    And you're under arrest
         for espionage

644
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:27,057
  and the murder of Ferdinand
    Pisco and Monica Grange.

645
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,793
 Well, you got me on espionage,
but I didn't kill those people.

646
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,862
    Oh, yeah? Then who did?

647
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,597
         (lights clack)

648
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,832
 Same person who just did that.

649
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,971
      (automatic gunfire)

650
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:49,947
You hit?
                             No.

651
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,015
Stay there.

652
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,683
                          PRIDE:
                       Gregorio?

653
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,952
                       You okay?

654
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,687
Two gunmen went out the balcony.

655
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,622
They have the Playbook.

656
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:01,625
      Torres, two suspects
    headed your way, armed.

657
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:05,195
      Torres, do you copy?

658
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:08,098
                 Agent Torres is
              unable to respond.

659
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,101
Who is this?

660
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,670
               The man you'll be
                negotiating with

661
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,238
                     if you want
              Torres back alive.

662
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,575
      Ask Eva what happens
      if you don't comply.

663
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,610
          I'll expect your call.

664
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,847
        (engine starts)

665
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,182
       (tires screeching)

666
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,596
     Just got off the phone
      with Director Vance,

667
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,198
who's ready to send the Marines
    down to get Torres back.

668
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,900
        What do we know?
    Not much.

669
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:44,802
Torres and the Playbook
were taken last night

670
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:47,671
by three gunmen in a black SUV
at the Roosevelt Hotel.

671
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,640
 Sebastian and McGee are trying
     to track the movements

672
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:52,176
 of that SUV, but it seems like
   it vanished into thin air.

673
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:55,045
     This Victor's good at
  what he does, whoever he is.

674
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,014
    Well, Eva seems to know
       exactly who he is.

675
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,782
       It's like she was
   expecting him last night.

676
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,284
  He could be the fifth buyer,

677
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,219
    responsible for killing
          the others.

678
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,921
      Yeah, laying in wait
          at the hotel

679
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,756
last night to grab the Playbook.

680
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:07,291
       But Eva was there
      when Ferdinand Pisco

681
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,027
       and Monica Grange
       were killed. Why?

682
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,630
           It's a lot
    of unanswered questions.

683
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,698
        Like, is Torres
       even still alive?

684
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,768
 Torres is alive because Victor
needs him as a bargaining chip.

685
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,169
        GREGORIO: Well, Playbook
                 can't be opened

686
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,904
         without Eva's
      voice verification.

687
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,774
    And Eva's the one person
  who might be able to fill in

688
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,809
 the rest of the blanks for us.
      Let's go, Gregorio.

689
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,645
         Keep digging.

690
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,321
I was hoping that my new friend
         would join us.

691
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,256
 I didn't catch her real name.

692
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,191
        That's too bad.

693
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:44,395
    Never would have guessed
 that she was a federal agent.

694
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:46,397
         Plus, she has
       a mean right hook.

695
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,399
             PRIDE:
       I'll let her know.

696
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:51,268
      Right now, you need
   to tell me who Victor is.

697
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,804
         Russian agent,

698
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:55,673
       vicious assassin,

699
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,408
           my mentor.

700
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,344
                       Taught me
              everything I know.

701
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,981
  We think he's responsible...

702
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,216
     for these two murders.

703
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:13,357
    Here we are again, Eva.

704
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,893
              Yup.

705
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:18,228
       You're accusing me
   of crimes I didn't commit.

706
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,430
  But you did commit a crime.

707
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:22,266
You stole the Playbook
from Homeland.

708
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,001
Sell to the highest bidder.

709
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:26,003
        Never pegged you
       as an opportunist.

710
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,738
                   You're right.

711
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,307
     I was using it as bait
      to draw Victor out.

712
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,042
          Your mentor.

713
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,080
        He recruited me
    when I was just a child.

714
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,117
   He took me from my family.

715
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,187
        He made me do...
        terrible things.

716
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,390
    He turned me into this.

717
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,058
    Woman without a country.

718
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,428
      I saw an opportunity
        to pay him back,

719
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,731
           'cause I knew that he
         would come crawling out

720
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,867
     from under his rock if
 the Playbook was up for grabs.

721
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,470
     It's too big a prize.

722
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:01,338
 And then I would have justice.

723
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,809
      Two people are dead
    because of your justice.

724
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,411
    Victor has the Playbook

725
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:10,414
and one of our agents.

726
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:13,016
  You need me to get him back.

727
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,818
    Trade me for your agent.

728
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,755
                  And we'll take
           Victor down together.

729
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:22,092
       Well, problem is,
    the way you've acted...

730
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,495
         don't know how
   I can afford to trust you.

731
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,365
   How can you afford not to?

732
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,445
Not sure we can
take Eva at her word.

733
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,846
              I'm sure we can't.

734
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,448
 I know that look in her eyes.

735
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,383
She's hell-bent on revenge.
                       I get it.

736
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,852
       If I had a chance
   to take down my ex-husband

737
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,922
 after all the crap he pulled,
     nothing would stop me.

738
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:55,092
  We need a plan B to get Torres
   and the Playbook back safely.

739
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:57,294
     McGee and I might have
    what you're looking for.

740
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,233
                            Hey.

741
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,002
                  GREGORIO: Hey.
              McGEE: Got footage

742
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,471
         of Victor's SUV leaving
      the hotel late last night.

743
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,339
     Before it disappeared
         into thin air?
            Actually, it didn't.

744
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,141
         The SUV passed
      a number of cameras

745
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,810
    while it fled the scene.

746
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,478
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, traffic
cameras, security cameras,

747
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,879
pedestrians' personal cameras...

748
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,881
                If we can access
                      that feed,

749
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,017
           we can piece together
     exactly where the SUV went.

750
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,485
  We don't have the resources

751
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,320
                  to consolidate
                    footage from

752
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,154
       dozens of sources
    to find a single target.

753
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,257
                   The NSA does.

754
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,026
This case involves
national security

755
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,028
  and international espionage.

756
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,497
  I asked Bishop to call in some
     favors from her old bosses.

757
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,265
Yeah. We track the SUV
from here.

758
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,867
Lasalle and Percy,
they're our boots on the ground

759
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:37,968
     while we gather intel.

760
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,036
 We're-we're gonna find Torres.

761
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,038
    How legal is this, guys?

762
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,039
 Well, strictly speaking, we're
 entering a bit of a gray zone.

763
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:46,310
     One of my team was taken by
    a sociopathic Russian agent.

764
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,045
   I say screw the gray zone.

765
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:51,148
     We're with you, McGee.

766
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,250
If it'll get
Torres back,

767
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:55,185
         get after it.

768
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,523
                  We need to buy
                 them more time.

769
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,859
 No way Victor's sitting around,
          waiting to get caught.

770
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,861
   Well, there's only one way
    to keep Victor occupied

771
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,363
    while we search for him:
 we need to put Eva into play.

772
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,872
   I'll call Torres's phone.

773
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:18,041
               See if I can make
            contact with Victor.

774
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,410
        (phone ringing)

775
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,579
  I was beginning to lose hope
        you'd ever call.

776
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,548
      So was Agent Torres.

777
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,450
        Is he all right?
           He's fine.

778
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,886
   I'll let you have him back
    in return for my agent.

779
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,588
    The only reason you want Eva
 back is to access the Playbook.

780
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,358
     Does it really matter,
with Torres's life on the line?

781
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,160
    I want to speak to him.

782
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,370
      Speak.

783
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,040
                     Pride.

784
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:53,043
                 You okay, Nick?

785
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:54,645
Well, my allergies are acting up
     'cause of all this drywall,

786
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:56,947
        but the view of
  the parade route from here,

787
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:59,216
                  it's, uh...
No hints, Agent Torres.

788
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,484
Just say you're fine.

789
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:03,086
                    I'm fine.

790
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,589
   I'll send a text where to
    bring Eva for the trade.

791
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,324
        Once I have her,
 I'll tell you where Torres is.

792
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,326
                 No, no, no, no.
            We do an even trade.

793
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:11,395
   Terms are non-negotiable.

794
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:17,668
                 There's 50 ways
                this goes south.

795
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,270
       That's optimistic.
     I can think about 100.

796
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,607
         (phone chimes)

797
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,242
         He wants us at

798
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,611
the Huey P. Long Bridge
in 20 minutes.

799
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:38,088
GREGORIO: Keep this very simple,
      and you don't go off book.

800
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,256
                     Understand?

801
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:40,991
Victor's gonna
go off book.

802
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,093
He's gonna double-cross you.
That's what he does.

803
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,963
       Yeah, well, that's why we
       have the tracking device.

804
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:48,265
            Keep tabs on Victor.

805
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:49,967
      Here I was thinking
         you were just

806
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,235
     looking for an excuse
         to get fresh.

807
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:53,971
             PRIDE:
  <i> Lasalle, what's the update?</i>

808
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,540
    Good news and bad news.

809
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,175
      Sebastian and McGee
    were able to track down

810
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,644
               Victor's SUV till
          its final destination.

811
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,245
      You got eyes on it?
          SONJA: Yeah.

812
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,982
It's parked outside an
abandoned building in the CBD.

813
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,116
           Bad news?

814
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:08,118
            Well, the building's
                30 stories tall.

815
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
    Torres might be inside,
       and he might not.

816
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:12,389
 It's gonna take time to search
 without alerting the Russians.

817
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:15,125
    Yeah, well, time's something
           we're running out of.

818
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:17,094
                Start searching.

819
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:21,131
I don't know about all this.

820
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,400
         What, you worried about
    taking on some Russian spies

821
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,168
                who are probably
             armed to the teeth?

822
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,304
     No. But I hate stairs,
   and looks like we're about

823
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,106
 to take on a crapload of them.

824
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,014
        Send Eva alone.

825
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:39,750
 Two of you stay where you are.

826
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:43,687
                Do what he says.

827
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,455
                     Be ready to
                   take him out.

828
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,758
You'll be okay.

829
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:09,579
Eva, it's been too long.

830
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:10,781
                   Our turn now!

831
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:12,649
                 Where's Torres?

832
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,419
    Once we're safely away,
   I'll text you the address.

833
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:18,388
Can't wait to catch up with you.

834
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,456
Play your cards right,

835
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,391
you just might survive
this mess.

836
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,526
  (knife stabs, Victor grunts)

837
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:24,394
   But you will not, Victor.

838
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,532
           (panting)

839
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,504
 What the hell did you just do?

840
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,074
Something I've been waiting for
          a long time.

841
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,375
 You just killed the one person

842
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:40,177
       who could help us
        get Torres back.

843
00:34:57,463 --> 00:34:59,763
              You really screwed
                   us here, Eva.

844
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,498
Victor's guys
are waiting for his call.

845
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,100
Now they'll kill Torres.

846
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,535
   He would've killed Torres
   anyway. I did you a favor.

847
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,404
                     How's that?
       I bought you time.

848
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:09,006
                He would've slit

849
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:10,607
      your agent's throat
   the minute we pulled away.

850
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,309
GREGORIO: Wait, Lasalle
and Sonja are already

851
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,244
     near Victor's hideout.
      We need to call them

852
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:17,280
and give them the exact location
   so they can rescue Torres.

853
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,682
                  I got an idea.

854
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,417
      But we're gonna need
        her help again.

855
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,789
         (phone rings)

856
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,457
       (speaking Russian)

857
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,441
      She's stalling, but
 it's not gonna work for long.

858
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,609
                What do you got?

859
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:48,278
         I have a trace
     on the Russian's cell.

860
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,412
           All right.
     Connecting to the GPS.

861
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,915
               Getting the exact
                coordinates now.

862
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:55,719
 There it is. Bull's-eye. Guys!

863
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:58,388
      Guys, we got a hit!
                Okay, Sebastian.

864
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,489
Tell us where.

865
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,258
  And tell us softly, please.

866
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,492
          17th floor.

867
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,460
        Northeast side.

868
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,522
You good?

869
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,324
           I'm good.

870
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,961
          What took you so long?

871
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:40,297
You do realize it was, like,

872
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,566
      17 freakin' flights
       of stairs, right?

873
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,602
You know
I had him, right?

874
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,204
                   Oh, yeah, you
             definitely had him.

875
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,472
      Don't people usually
      just say thank you?

876
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,474
             Oh, you're welcome.

877
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,476
              LASALLE: Should we
              leave him tied up?

878
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,811
              Yes.

879
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,484
       (lively jazz music
      playing in distance)

880
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:08,258
Special Agent Torres.

881
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,794
          Glad to see
   you survived your ordeal.

882
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:13,697
    Managed to get yourself
          in the game.

883
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:16,333
I told you I hate
riding the bench.

884
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,970
You did good, too.

885
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:22,372
      Not bad for a couple
      of new guys, right?

886
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,374
   Well, it's not six months
    in an Ecuadorian prison

887
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,910
 just to set up cover, but, uh,

888
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,979
yeah, not bad.

889
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:38,255
      Shoving off in five.

890
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,628
            (mouths)

891
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,498
        Beautiful night.

892
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,834
It'll be your last for a while.
Right.

893
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:53,603
 They don't have a lot of night
 activities in federal prison.

894
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,038
   Yeah, well, you should've
       thought about that

895
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,573
 before your little adventure.

896
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:58,675
       Believe it or not,
 this is exactly how I thought

897
00:37:58,677 --> 00:37:59,976
       it would all end.

898
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,945
And it was completely worth it.

899
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:05,282
   Getting revenge was worth
     a lifetime in prison?

900
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:08,551
   Meeting you was nice, too.

901
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:09,986
Too bad we won't be able to get

902
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,521
       to know each other
       a little better...

903
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:18,828
        Never say never.

904
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,343
  (lively jazz music continues
          in distance)

905
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:35,578
    You sure you got to go?
 You're gonna miss Mardi Gras.

906
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,614
    Hasn't this been Mardi Gras?
No, no, no, no.

907
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:39,349
This has been the lead-up
to Mardi Gras.

908
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,885
Actual Mardi Gras day is
when the city really goes off.

909
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:44,354
            Oh. You know what, I
         think I've had my share

910
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:45,955
                  of New Orleans
                    shenanigans.

911
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,625
        Maybe next year.
                  Mm.

912
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,627
                           Uh...

913
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:54,964
  you think it's okay if maybe
 I call you from time to time?

914
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:56,833
          Yeah, sure.

915
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,469
 The way you, uh, just asked me
 made it sound a little weird.

916
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,072
    Well, you know, I just,
   I might need some advice.

917
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:04,607
 Get Future Sebastian's wisdom.

918
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,344
       Okay. But you got to stop
    calling me Future Sebastian.

919
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,579
                The fact is, you
                 are Past McGee.

920
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,514
                And doing a real
                 good job of it.

921
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,351
   Ah, there you are, McGee.

922
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,786
  I just dropped some food off
    with Torres in the car.

923
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,988
A little snack
for the road.
Oh, appreciate that. Thank you.

924
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,658
        (phone ringing)
          Pleasure. Listen, keep
            an eye on Eva, okay?

925
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,793
                   She's tricky.
You got it.

926
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,729
                         Jethro.
  GIBBS: Special Agent Pride.

927
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:28,498
         You'll be happy to know
      I'm sending your team home

928
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,934
            mostly in one piece.

929
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:33,636
     Eh, you pulled it off
     on your own. Not bad.

930
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:36,439
     I'm just glad we kept
   all of official Washington

931
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,640
    from flooding the city.

932
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,476
   Yeah. This time, at least.

933
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,544
 Well, let's keep it that way.
        What do you say?

934
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,747
       Unless, of course,
    it's for a social visit.

935
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:46,583
Next time there's another party,

936
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:49,652
     I might just pop down,
     surprise you, Dwayne.

937
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,654
            This is New Orleans,
                     my brother.

938
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,656
                  There's always
         another party going on.
