00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,344

so I called you.

                 Lasalle, Percy.

          Oh, my God.

00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:17,462

82
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,901
         Yeah, I know.
                  Yeah, we can't
             believe it, either.

83
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,603
You have any idea
who did it?

84
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:25,871
       It's complicated.

85
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,639
 Well, I might be able to help.

86
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,310
    Victim took a flyer off
    a nearby roof, we think.

87
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:34,613
   Been told he's a person of
  interest in Dwayne's murder.

88
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,482
   Well, we appreciate the call,
     but our team was suspended.

89
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,917
We can't, technically, be here.

90
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,352
Technically,
you're not,

91
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:41,887
otherwise my ass
is on the line,

92
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,855
but I was asked
to reach out.

93
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,357
  Ms. Loretta.

94
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,658
This is not a Coast Guard body.

95
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,260
   Okay? We're baby-sitting.

96
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,661

       about five minutes

97
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,597
   before the NOPD shows up.

98
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,665
      Make the most of it.

99
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,267

Thank you.

100
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,635
    What's up with the cloak
          and dagger?

101
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,837
          You tell me.

102
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,909
                         (sighs)
                          Stone.

103
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,811
      Hamilton's right-hand man.

104
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,779
        And the suspect
    most likely responsible

105
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,514
   for trying to kill Pride.

106
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,649
                  What happened?

107
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,718
 Ligature marks on the wrists,

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,987
      contusions, bruising
         of the face...

109
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,589
    He was bound, beaten and
  probably tossed off a roof.

110
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,325
                So, not suicide.

111
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,427
                 No, but I found
            some evidence that--

112
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,830
               I don't know what
                  to make of it.

113
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,665
                     Right here.

114
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,367
         A fingerprint.

115
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,471
             WADE:
         It's Dwayne's.

116
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,910
       Does Swanson know?

117
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,412
     Only the three of us.

118
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,447
             Good.
    Let's keep it that way.

119
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,583
     Well, look, you guys.
     There has to be a good
     explanation for this.

120
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:48,720
      Pride's been pushed
to the limit, Percy, all right?

121
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,657
Going after Hamilton's cost him
       his job, his team.

122
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,275
     It's a lot of bodies.

123
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:54,892
  And you weren't saying this
    a few days ago, Lasalle.

124
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,628
       In fact, you were
      saying the opposite.

125
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,363
          Yeah, well,
     that was before Pride

126
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,065
      decided to play dead
         and disappear.

127
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,833
      He had his reasons.

128
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,402
         You know that.

129
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,936
   Look, I don't want to jump
        to conclusions.

130
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:09,675
  I still have to get the body
    back to autopsy, but...

131
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:12,077
I wanted you
to bear witness.

132
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,945
Because whatever Pride did here,

133
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,447
       no one else needs
        to know about it

134
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,383
until you find him.

135
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,797
         I've never seen so many
    condolence gifts in my life.

136
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,565
                      The entire
            kitchen's filled up.

137
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,467
         Half the restaurants in
     New Orleans sent a platter.

138
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,402
Yeah. King's loved
in this city.

139
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,538
Well, I told Roy
to take some of the food home.

140
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,340
  He's pretty broken up, too.

141
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,075
           I just hate having to
      pretend that Pride's dead.

142
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,577
 Yeah, well, if we want to keep
    him alive and find him,

143
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,579
that's what we're all gonna have
         to keep doing.

144
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,848
Well, uh, how exactly are we
supposed to find him, though?

145
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,616
           I mean, we don't have
       any badges, no resources.

146
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,819
  In fact, none of you should
  be here in the first place.

147
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,620
What the hell is he doing here?

148
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,556
      I asked him to come.
  Pride's off the reservation.

149
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,491
    Hamilton's declared war.
 We're all gonna lose our jobs,

150
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,026
         or better yet,
   we're gonna be reassigned

151
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,961
       to some backwater.
         We need help.

152
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,496
               So you called the
            FBI agent that tried

153
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,797
               to break us apart
             in the first place?

154
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,432
          Seems you've been able
         to accomplish that feat

155
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,967
                all on your own.
Look, you're right.

156
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,569
  Isler's a pain in the ass.
                       Hey.

157
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,371
      What? He's ambitious
      and a rule-follower,

158
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,772
       but you know what?
      He's incorruptible,

159
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,941
     and a man of his word,
     and we can trust him.

160
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,709
        Thanks, I think.

161
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,378
       He's our only hope
       at finding Pride,

162
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,446
       stopping Hamilton
     and saving Clearwater.

163
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:24,049
I hate it,

164
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,017
  but it kind of makes sense.

165
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,489
    Well, thank you for your
     generosity of spirit.

166
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,059
        Now, Gregorio downloaded
                 me on the case.

167
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,727
          I've got it from here.

168
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,662
       I will find Pride.

169
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,798
You can all go home now.
                      SEBASTIAN:
           W-Wait. What? No way.

170
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,867
Yeah, we're not sitting
on the sidelines.

171
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,436
That's precisely what you'll do
    and it's non-negotiable.

172
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,505
     All right, let's chat.

173
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,809
I agreed to take the reigns
and fix what your team broke.

174
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,111
I did not agree to allow you
to go rogue along with Pride.

175
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,548
          No. You're 100% right;
         we should not go rogue.

176
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,984
             But you need to get
                our badges back.

177
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,852
        Your own Deputy Director
                  suspended you.

178
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,521
               How am I supposed
                 to change that?

179
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,722
'Cause you got pull.

180
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,757
                      Yes. I do.

181
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,759
      But I'm not about to waste
           it for a former agent

182
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,561
                  who decided to
             give up her career,
    Ah.

183
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,096
     and run away to the circus.

184
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,132
Are you kidding me? You're still
    mad that I came to NCIS?

185
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,635
          I spent my life trying
   to figure out where I fit in,

186
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,470
             and it was not FBI,
                    it was here.

187
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,472
        And I'm not about to let
    that disappear because of...

188
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,873
That's really beautiful,
Gregorio,

189
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,442
but it doesn't change
a damn thing.

190
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,943
      I'm not finished, Raymond.

191
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,778
  If Dwayne Pride doesn't want
          to be found,

192
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,547
    he's not gonna be found.
  I don't care how many agents

193
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,649
           you have on the case.

194
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,684
 You're saying that I need you.

195
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:36,021
          No... Okay.

196
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,123
      What I'm saying is,

197
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,460
    if you really want to finish
          what you started here,

198
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:45,497
  who better to find him than
the team he personally trained?

199
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,168
           (sighing):
           All right.

200
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,737
      I'll make some calls
   and get your badges back.

201
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,206
        Now, the case, where are
          we with finding Pride?

202
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,640
   We know he was with Stone
          last night,

203
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,808
   Hamilton's right-hand man.

204
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,677
Who he threw off a roof.

205
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,512
We are not sure about that.

206
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,581
                We couldn't find
             Stone's cell phone.

207
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,015
          Pride probably has it.

208
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,784
All right, well, I'll work
on tracking the phone.

209
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,886
 Hoping he's on the same network
        as the other operatives.

210
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,521
LASALLE:
All right, Stone's body
is in autopsy.

211
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:10,889
  Since we've been reinstated,

212
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,491
                Percy and I will
                go talk to Wade.

213
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,159
                See if she's got
              any more evidence.

214
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,861
                  How about you?

215
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,629
            Any clue as to where
        your boss may be headed?

216
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,499
             Nope.

217
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,267
   But I know who he's after.

218
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,203
You cannot go inside.

219
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,038
    The mayor's in a locked-door
            meeting all morning.

220
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,807
       No, sorry, ma'am.
  We need to talk to him now.

221
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,041
            This can't wait.

222
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,176
It's gonna have to.

223
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,911
And you...
you need to leave.

224
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,179
           Who the hell are you?

225
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,681
Captain Estes, NOPD.

226
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,283
I'm takin' over the
mayor's protection detail.

227
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,518
                 Okay. Well, I'm
          Special Agent Gregorio

228
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,752
     and I need to get in there.

229
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,020
      Yeah, I know exactly
          who you are.

230
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,188
                  We believe the
              mayor's in danger.

231
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,689
Yeah, from people like her.

232
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,924
Shoot-out in
the French Quarter,

233
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,192
car running into
a crowded restaurant,

234
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,629
        all courtesy of
     Dwayne Pride and NCIS.

235
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,198
 Whoa. He's no longer with us,
  okay? Have a little respect.

236
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,534
Yeah? Well, he's not
the only one.
                           Yeah.

237
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,968
   I just found out that the
    mayor's private security

238
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,537
   consultant was found dead
          last night.

239
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,205
As well as
Congresswoman Angelou.

240
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,574
       Chairwoman of the
   Armed Services Committee?

241
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,109
    Had some kind of stroke
   at the airport, so no one

242
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,678
       is getting inside,
 especially NCIS, so let's go.

243
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,913
                       No, I'm--
                        Get off.

244
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,147
         I'm not NCIS.

245
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,649
 I'm FBI Deputy Director Isler.

246
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,850
      Now, let me explain
         the situation.

247
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:12,918
                     Screw this.

248
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,985
H-hey! Stop!

249
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,121
          Stop!

250
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,822
         He's not here.

251
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,125
He came in at 7:00, never left.

252
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,093
      We have a code red,
     the mayor is missing.

253
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,062
        I need all units
    to search the building.

254
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,331
          What's this?
                  Navy shipyard

255
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,966
    the mayor wants to build
         in Clearwater.

256
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,168
   The reason so many people
           have died.

257
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,604
      Including, it seems,
       the congresswoman.

258
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,173
Yeah, and if we don't act fast,
a lot of others could get hurt.

259
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,842
   The entire neighborhood of
  Clearwater is getting razed.

260
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:40,679
The mayor's not in the building
    and his car is missing.

261
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,747
            We're gonna activate
                    the GPS now.

262
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,817
       I'm gonna need to talk to
  both of you after we find him.

263
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,629
             Stone.

264
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,232
             Stone!

265
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,168
  Where the hell are you, man?

266
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,836
   I got a schedule to keep.
     Stone, where you at?!

267
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,339
        (grunts, groans)

268
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,276
                        (groans)

269
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,913
       Douglas... really?

270
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,716
  Dammit. Dwayne, you shot me.

271
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:18,917
       You shot yourself.

272
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,919
  You're supposed to be dead.

273
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,021
And you're gonna end up that way
unless you do as I say.

274
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,623
Get in the car.
               (Hamilton groans)

275
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,206
          Gregorio and Isler are
      being interviewed by NOPD,

276
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,273
            but they sent photos
                  from the scene

277
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,341
    where Hamilton was abducted.

278
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,777
Shell casings, blood.

279
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,045
         Who got shot?
           Hamilton.

280
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,647
                           Whoa.

281
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,248
 I mean, at least, according to
    NOPD crime scene techs,

282
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,684
     but I, I can't believe
       that Pride did it.

283
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,152
    We couldn't believe he threw
  that guy off the roof, either.

284
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,221
       Hey, we don't know
       that he did that.

285
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,957
           You were just with me
              at autopsy, Percy.

286
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,225
                   Doc Wade said

287
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,327
         that Stone was forcibly
           thrown off that roof.

288
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,428
          Wait, what?

289
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,963
 What is it with you, Lasalle?

290
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,665
    You've known that man
     for over ten years.

291
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,433
You always have his back,
and now all of a sudden

292
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,834
you think he's
gone off the rails?

293
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,069
     Yeah, I don't want to.

294
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,238
        But if Pride's got
        a breaking point,

295
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,706
         it's Hamilton.

296
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,708
       So let's find him.

297
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,843
       Look, uh, Wade...

298
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,846
      got this foreign substance
         off of Stone's clothes.

299
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,848
             Can you analyze it?
Yeah, will do.

300
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,451
   But, uh, look, I want to show
       you guys something first.

301
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,987
       It's the tire treads from
       the Hamilton crime scene.

302
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,690
This could be the car
that Pride took him in.

303
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,124
    Can you get us details?

304
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,959
Yeah, Firestone,
deep traction.

305
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,062
Probably from a late model
American sedan.

306
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,864
I'm thinking
a silver Chrysler 300.

307
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,400
So you got the color of the car
    off of some tire tracks?

308
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,735
          Well, I did
    when I cross-referenced

309
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,136
                 the tire treads
                 to surveillance

310
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,805
                  that was taken
              about a block away

311
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,139
                from Pride's bar
              after it exploded.

312
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,875
I'm guessing that
this was Stone's car,

313
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,244
and then Pride took it.
                 Ah, ah, ah, ah.

314
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,880
      The man is under FBI
investigation for a hot minute,

315
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,016
   and look how he's treated.
    I was gonna mention you.

316
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,217
                  Mm-hmm.
I'm glad you're back, P.

317
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,285
  And better than ever, baby.

318
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,486
        Hasn't been the same
            without you.

319
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,289
        Of course not.
    But back to business.

320
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,791
I accessed the city's
surveillance cameras
for this footage.

321
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,160
     And can you find more?
      I'm working on it--

322
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,895
           but that's a lot
       of city miles to cover.

323
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,896
     Boss man could be anywhere.

324
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,331
    Not just anywhere.

325
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,034
    Look, we all know Pride
        inside and out.

326
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:19,237
And I don't care how obsessed he
is with bringing Hamilton down,

327
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,207
if that man is hurt,
he's gonna try to fix him.

328
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,977
  Yeah, especially if he's got
     information he wants.

329
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,247
              (groaning in pain)

330
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,918
              I need a hospital,
                 not a Band-Aid.

331
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,453
           I know you're pissed,

332
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,789
            but I never meant to
           draw that gun on you.

333
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,057
You sent Stone to kill me.

334
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,959
        Is that what he said?
             He's a liar.

335
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,994
Stone's dead.

336
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,330
      Add him to the list
     of people who've paid

337
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,098
for your Clearwater plan.
                  (grunts)

338
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,401
            I don't have a plan.

339
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,270
      I don't have a plan.
            (yells)

340
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,872
            (groans)

341
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,041
            I am revitalizing...

342
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,043
        a blighted neighborhood.

343
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,146
By razing the area
for a shipyard!

344
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,782
         (phone rings)
    I literally have no idea
   what you're talking about.

345
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,018
            (beeps)

346
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,419
      Hello.

347
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,221
Stone, it's Johan.
Team's in place.

348
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,123
Operation's a go.
Three-hour countdown.

349
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,958
Final confirmation.

350
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,898
      Confirmation denied.

351
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,400
       You're not Stone.

352
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,404
          Who's Johan?

353
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,174
Huh? What's
the operation?
     Dwayne. You know, Dwayne...

354
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,408
              Hey.
                       Dwayne...

355
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,443
     You're gonna tell me.
                         Dwayne,

356
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,213
    I'm gonna bleed to death
 unless you get me to a doctor.
No, no, no.

357
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,514
         Not just yet.

358
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:40,819
         (phone rings)

359
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,986
             Hello?

360
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:42,821
           Loretta...

361
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:43,988
           Dw... Hey.

362
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,123
        What's going on?

363
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,524
Are you alone?

364
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,926
              No.

365
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,928
   The police are everywhere.

366
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,329
   Did you kidnap the mayor?

367
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,363
No, I wouldn't call it
kidnapping.

368
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,232
                  Yeah, I would.
Okay, listen.

369
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,034
You can't let anybody know
that we're talking.

370
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,101
       Is Hamilton okay?

371
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,870
     Hamilton is<i> not</i> okay.

372
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,171
               He's got a bullet
               in his upper arm.

373
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,873
        He's bleeding fast,
        even with pressure.

374
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,107
       He needs a doctor.

375
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,409
No, that's why I called you.

376
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,244
 To help me remove the bullet.

377
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,146
   Where are you? I'll come.

378
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,415
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

379
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:13,284
  Dwayne, what are you doing?
 I'm finishing what I started.

380
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,855
  Requires Hamilton to survive
        a little longer.

381
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,189
Now, tell me what to do.

382
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,557
          Okay, uh...

383
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,026
    you need to put pressure
    on the brachial artery.

384
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,428
  It's just below the armpit.

385
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,430
  Should help with hemostasis.

386
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,900
       (groaning loudly)

387
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:29,901
      Yeah, it's working.

388
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,469
Now you need to tie off the arm.

389
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,571
          Tight enough
   to stop circulation flow.

390
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:37,075
Which could cause further trauma
  if he doesn't see a doctor.

391
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,410
        (yells, groans)

392
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,884
                        (groans)
             What are you doing?

393
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:46,918
 Loretta...

394
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,136
                        What are
                      you doing?

395
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,353
   Loretta, you tell anybody
      I was on the phone?

396
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,588
        Absolutely not.

397
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,624
           HAMILTON:
          Stop. Oh...

398
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,893
(panting)

399
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:55,960
       (frustrated groan)

400
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,096
You've got a tracking device?

401
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,265
              Of course I've got
              a tracking device.

402
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:03,301
          I got maniacs like you
          following me, don't I?

403
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,436
Loretta, tell the others...

404
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,539
Stone has another team
in play in Clearwater.

405
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,541
     Something's happening
    in the next three hours.

406
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,977
 Dwayne, wait. Dway... Dwayne!

407
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,980
          Move! Move!
         You go right!

408
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,082
    (shouting indistinctly)

409
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,117
Clear!

410
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,251
                          Clear!

411
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,103
                We got problems.

412
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,506
      NOPD used a GPS chip
      hidden on the mayor

413
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,608
          to track him
 to a shuttered medical clinic.

414
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,276
                    He was gone,
               along with Pride.

415
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,945
               Need to know
           where they are now.

416
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,546
                 Patton searched
           surveillance cameras.

417
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,449
         Stone's car was driving
           away from the clinic.

418
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,584
   Then it went off the grid.

419
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,019
I assure you

420
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,521
    we're not the only ones
        with that image.

421
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,389
   It's only a matter of time
          before NOPD

422
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,191
  figures out that Pride's alive
        and has Hamilton.

423
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,060
 Yeah, he'll be harder to find
       now that he knows

424
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,695
      he's being tracked.
                          ISLER:
            The answer's simple.

425
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:07,432
We contact Captain Estes at NOPD
    and tell him everything.

426
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,001
              Uh-uh, we do that,
            they'll assume Pride
            kidnapped the mayor.

427
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,736
          He'll be public enemy
               number one.

428
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,538
    He<i> did</i> kidnap the mayor.

429
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,606
Look, you're under
the impression that Pride

430
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,308
        went off the reservation
            on some holy mission

431
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,611
       to save the city--
   perhaps he just went off.

432
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,348
  He told Wade that there were
 more operatives in Clearwater.

433
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,616
       He's still trying
   to save the neighborhood.

434
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,218
Problem is, we're no closer
to figuring out

435
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,187
Hamilton's plan
to empty Clearwater.

436
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,022
 Actually, we're a lot closer.

437
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,491
I just analyzed the trace found
      on Stone's clothing.

438
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,360
     It's TATB explosives.

439
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,495
 It's highly insensitive, which
 means it's easy to transport,

440
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,330
   and it's... very powerful.

441
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,766
Stone blew up
Pride's bar.
      Not with that.

442
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,634
                  That's used to
              detonate warheads.

443
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,104
    Stone's operatives have
         another plan.
          SEBASTIAN: Yeah, well,

444
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,106
 they're taking something out--
      something big enough

445
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,408
       to drive the residents
    out of Clearwater for good.
Yeah, Clearwater

446
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,143
is big-- there's no way we find

447
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,511
  those explosives on our own.

448
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,513
 Then we loop in Captain Estes.
No.

449
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,781
        (phone ringing)
                      NOPD can't
                     be trusted.

450
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,683
                      But I know
                someone who can.

451
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,652
         That's Estes.

452
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:02,787
I'm done with this charade.

453
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,591
 Captain Estes, we need to talk
     about Mayor Hamilton.

454
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:07,792
    Isler, wait.
                      I'm sorry,

455
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,427
            somebody just walked
                 into my office.

456
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,162
Just hear me out. Please.

457
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,464
                 I'm sorry, I'll
            call you right back.

458
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,433
Pride's out there
trying to get answers

459
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,701
         from Hamilton.

460
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,269
       If you really want
       to sort this out,

461
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,071
 you need to give us more time.

462
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,406
    By abetting kidnapping?

463
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,607
     Won't just be<i> your</i> ass
          on the line,

464
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,075
   target'll be on my back, too.
All right,

465
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,343
    let's just be honest--
        target's been

466
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,811
on your back since you got here.

467
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,546
 I know why you wanted me here.

468
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,680
              No.
                 You wanted your
                    badges back,

469
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:30,748
and you wanted me to step aside,

470
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,749
   but that's not how I work.

471
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,684
              I'm calling Estes.
    The minute you

472
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,453
        tell them Pride's alive,
      it'll be full-court press.

473
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,156
        NOPD doesn't give a crap
        about saving Clearwater.

474
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,792
    You will undercut everything
             Pride's fought for.

475
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,694
          (whispers):
            Come on.

476
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,696
             Help me help Pride.

477
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,231
                         Please.

478
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,101
    I'll give you two hours

479
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,769
         to figure out
  where those explosives are.

480
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,173
        Okay. All right, thanks.

481
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,079
           HAMILTON:
            <i> Dwayne.</i>

482
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,314
    <i> Dwayne, we got to stop.</i>

483
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,715
          I need help.

484
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,784
           (groaning)

485
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,621
    Clearwater Baptist, huh?
            (sniffs)

486
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,790
What is this,
another metaphor for...

487
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,193
my "come to Jesus" moment?

488
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:18,129
You're way past repenting.

489
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,431
 And you're way out of options.

490
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,233
               Who's Johan?

491
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,368
What is the plan?

492
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,570
            Or what?

493
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,638
   You're not gonna kill me.

494
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,740
      Stone said the same thing,

495
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,677
  and look what happened to him.

496
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,115
       Well, he deserved
    whatever you did to him.
               You gonna tell me

497
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,417
that Stone's responsible
for all this?

498
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,653
Using drug money
to buy property in Clearwater,

499
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,189
    the personal attacks on
 my team-- Stone's responsible?

500
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,191
                Taking advantage

501
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,759
      of my desire to help

502
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,761
         a struggling area
           of this city.

503
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,264
            Bringing in
         thousands of jobs.

504
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,500
          And the only thing I'm
             guilty of is caring

505
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,702
   about this city<i> too</i> much.

506
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,903
      (laughing): Even you
   are not that good a liar.

507
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,140
                  Then why don't
                    you come in?

508
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,774
               Come on in, then!

509
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,511
       And you tell your version
             and I'll tell mine!

510
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,613
            And who do you think
          they're gonna believe?

511
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,482
 Some... fugitive federal agent

512
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,352
          or the respected mayor
                 of New Orleans?

513
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,888
  You got no moves left here.

514
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,623
     I got one.

515
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,658
      I wasn't expecting
         an epiphany.

516
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,927
          Just betting
       on the only motive

517
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,363
  that's ever mattered to you.
            (groans)

518
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,431
              Self-preservation.

519
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,400
What are you doing?
(yells)

520
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,936
I didn't bring you here
as a metaphor to Clearwater.

521
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,771
      This is ground zero.

522
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:37,642
           Whatever's
    about to happen here...

523
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,311
        will happen to you, too.

524
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,449
  Pride is alive?

525
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,319
   You got to be kidding me.

526
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,654
        I sent flowers.

527
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,556
            Yeah, it was
    a very tasteful arrangement.

528
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,558
     And you can have them back
             if you want.

529
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,959
                Uh, no. I...

530
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,795
    We would have told you
  this morning if we could.

531
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,830
            Is this some kind of
           undercover operation?

532
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:03,267
      Uh, sort of, yeah.
It's-it's a little complicated.

533
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,304
 Listen, the more we tell you,
the more compromised you'll be.

534
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,339
        The situation's
      not exactly kosher.

535
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,874
         Well, give me
      the Reader's Digest.

536
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,577
          Okay. Well,
    we think Mayor Hamilton

537
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,212
    has a team of operatives

538
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,447
  planting an explosive device
         in Clearwater.

539
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,950
  Yeah, and I've been working on
    a list of potential targets.

540
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:22,720
There is a chemical plant,
sewage treatment facility,

541
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,455
electrical grid station,

542
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,490
     or it could be
  a population center,

543
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,992
            like a grocery store
                    or a school.

544
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,994
            In other words,
          we don't know jack.

545
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,431
Which is why I'm here--
you need Coast Guard tech.

546
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,900
  You've got that FLIR camera
that can detect heat signatures.

547
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,868
    Yeah, but it's got to be
           hush-hush.

548
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,737
Because it's not exactly kosher.

549
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,772
And we got to move fast.

550
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,408
   Well, I'll get the bird in
the air and boots on the ground.

551
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,345
        You coming?
 Yeah, I'll go.

552
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,480
Listen, I'm gonna stick around.

553
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,649
      Try and locate Pride
and Hamilton before anyone else.

554
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,017
                     You got it.

555
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,519
                    (sighs)

556
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,634
       MAN (over radio):
  <i> CGIS and NCIS ground, 6592,</i>

557
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,003
 <i> overhead Clearwater, beginning</i>
 <i> Sierra Sierra search pattern.</i>

558
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:15,006
            SWANSON:
 <i> Copy that. We are in transit.</i>

559
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,610
              MAN:
         Wait a minute.

560
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,412
  <i> The FLIR camera's picking up</i>
   <i> an abnormal heat signature</i>

561
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,747
       <i> It's from a power</i>
        <i> and water truck</i>

562
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,782
parked off Adelaide and Fulton.

563
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,951
            SWANSON:
          We're on it.

564
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,753
         (siren chirps)

565
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,390
          SONJA: NCIS!

566
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:42,600
SONJA:
We got a runner!

567
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,038
          NCIS! Stop!

568
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,406
           (gunshot)

569
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,650
         We got a body.

570
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,985
  Some kind of security guard.

571
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,422
          Explosives.

572
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,824
   But I'm guessing there was
     a lot more back here.

573
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,059
                      SEBASTIAN:
   Guys, we got another problem.

574
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:10,328
       That suspect just
    sent out a Stuxnet worm.

575
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,564
              None of us knows
               what that is.

576
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,899
   I-It's a malicious virus.

577
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,634
It infects programmable
   logic controllers.

578
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:18,836
         Uh, overrides
     mechanical processes.

579
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,404
  It was specifically designed

580
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,639
          to take out
  industrial computer systems.

581
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,507
All right, what's it targeting?

582
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,644
       They just infected
     the Industrial Canal.

583
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,880
        (alarm blaring)

584
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,125
PILOT:<i> CG 6592, we have a visual</i>
       <i> on the south lock.</i>

585
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,128
       <i> Gates are opening.</i>
<i>Water's rushing into the canal.</i>

586
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,797
        (alarm wailing)

587
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,539
            Dwayne.

588
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,408
Dwayne, you hear that, right?

589
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,543
           Flood warning sirens.

590
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,746
       Don't change the subject.

591
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:04,081
     Need to start talking.

592
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,916
                But, uh...

593
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,618
                we should leave.

594
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,087
      Those sirens go off
  twice a week in the spring.

595
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,922
                Usually a drill.

596
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,491
             Uh...

597
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,559
    better safe than sorry,
         though, right?

598
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,697
          You nervous?

599
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,534
            Nervous?
  Well, I'm bleeding to death,

600
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:25,436
       being held hostage
by a rogue federal agent, so...

601
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:26,904
                 And yet this is

602
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,840
  the first time I've actually
        seen you scared.

603
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:37,481
        You're not gonna
     push these people out.

604
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,584
You're gonna wash 'em out.

605
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,586
You're flooding Clearwater.

606
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,555
                That's-that's...
                     ridiculous.

607
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:45,923
      Devastate the area.

608
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,091
    Relocate the residents.

609
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,659
      Build your shipyard.

610
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,194
      Look, if I say yes,

611
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,929
      will you uncuff me?

612
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,931
        You found a way

613
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,967
    to make the river rise.
            And yet

614
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,437
that's not enough.

615
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,809
             After Katrina, they
    strengthened the floodgates.

616
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:08,579
               Few extra feet of
               water wouldn't...

617
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:11,582
      Dwayne, seriously...

618
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,451
         we got to go!

619
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:17,988
       You're taking out
        the floodgates.

620
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:27,798
        Where you going?

621
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,668
I'm gonna stop what you started
       once and for all.

622
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,036
   But if we get flooded here

623
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,472
         I'll be under
      nine feet of water!

624
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,642
  Better hope I save the day.

625
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:50,488
           Ah... aah!

626
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,002
Stone's operatives were able to
 hack into city infrastructure.

627
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,872
 Disable the lock systems across
     the whole Industrial Canal.

628
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,139
       That means water's
         flowing freely

629
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:10,774
         from the river
     to Lake Pontchartrain.

630
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,710
    Yeah, if one of those levees
        breaches, then the water

631
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,645
         would change course and
      start flooding Clearwater.

632
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:16,113
   That's what the explosives
            are for:

633
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,915
      to take out a levee,
   then take out Clearwater.

634
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:19,984
Can you reverse the hack?
              I mean, maybe with
                  Patton's help.

635
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:22,119
           Get to it.
And based on the evidence
in the truck

636
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,054
there are more
suspects with explosives.

637
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:26,790
And the body of a security guard
  who works riverside access.

638
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,026
     Suspects are somewhere
 on the water. Probably rigging

639
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,060
                  a levee.
But which one?

640
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,629
            SWANSON:
        We have patrols

641
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,197
    sweeping the waterways.
 It's a lot of miles to cover.

642
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,933
And there's no guarantee we find
the right levee before it blows.

643
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,202
 Evacuating Clearwater just in
 case, but it's gonna be tough.

644
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,904
             We have to go house
           to house to make sure

645
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,939
       that people leave,
 and we have no manpower here.

646
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:43,307
                    I'll get you
           those reinforcements.

647
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,975
         Find me those suspects.

648
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,311
                   King was part
                 of river rescue

649
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:48,812
              for the first week
                     of Katrina.

650
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,681
              Investigated levee
             breaches afterward.

651
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,917
    He has to have an idea which
        levee's most vulnerable.

652
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,653
     Oh, so you don't think
    he's gone crazy anymore?
I never thought

653
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,054
      he was crazy, Percy.

654
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,023
       He has every right
     to take Hamilton out.

655
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,292
     I just hope he chooses
     not to cross the line.

656
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:03,227
     Let's head to the river and
         see if we can't retrace

657
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,129
          the truck's movements.

658
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:22,813
          (indistinct
     police radio chatter)

659
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,250

     siren starts wailing)

660
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,186
          Oh, damn it.

661
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,889

   turning onto Terpsichore.

669
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,107
         That's got to be Pride.

670
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,110
NOPD just spotted him coming out
  of Clearwater a minute ago.

671
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,712
     No sign of the mayor.

672
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:56,947
How'd you get this feed?

673
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,949
   Never mind. Don't answer.

674
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,085
        The bigger issue
     is NOPD's onto Pride.

675
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,387
    And they're bringing in
    the cavalry as we speak.

676
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,663
   (indistinct radio chatter)

677
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,039
 Driver, turn off the ignition.

678
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,142
           Hands out the window.

679
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,045
       You're surrounded.

680
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,248
                 Comply with our
                    instructions

681
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,884
or we will shoot.

682
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,721
   What the hell is he doing?
      He's heading to the river.

683
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:40,257
              He must know about
                     the levees.
That's a reach, Gregorio.

684
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,092
        He's desperate.
We need to help him.

685
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,761
Seriously.
If we don't do something,

686
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,829
we're gonna watch him die
on that street.

687
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,432
                      Isler.
  I know, Gregorio.

688
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,967
  I know.

689
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:51,969
Let me think.

690
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,314
  He's reaching for something.

691
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,183
     I've got a clean shot.

692
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,018
    Standing by for your go.

693
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,330
           Hold this.

694
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:21,832
    Who am I speaking with?

695
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,068
 This is Deputy Director Isler.

696
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,970
       You need to listen
     very carefully to me.

697
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:30,207
      If you and your men
 don't stand down this moment,

698
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,210
       all of our careers
    will be over by tonight.

699
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,479
  Dwayne Pride is in that car

700
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:39,049
        and he's working
       undercover for me.

701
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,498
           All right.
      We're standing down.

702
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,121
                      (sighs)

703
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:18,756
                    Thank you.

704
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,424
I truly hope we got this right.

705
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,126
       (computer chirps)

706
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,094
       I just got a text.

707
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,829
                So did I.
  It's from an unknown number.

708
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,197
         All it says is
    "Florida Street Levee."

709
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,832
             Yeah, that's Pride.

710
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,868
             It must be what the
      operatives are sabotaging.

711
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,403
                 We need to call
          Lasalle and Sonja now.

  All right, well, you better

725

           hurry up,

  could go off at any moment.

  keep the water from rising.

00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,645
        This is gonna take time.
      So, in other words,

731
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,013
    we're screwed right now.

732
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,015
 Ball's in your court, Lasalle.

733
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,384
           (gunshots)

734
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,552
       Automatic gunfire
     coming from up there.

735
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,053
                        LASALLE:
                     Let's move!

736
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:45,102
      (gunshots continue)

737
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,570
            (gasps)

738
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,438

00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,476
             NCIS!

00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,490
       King! You're good!

742
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,927
              ♪ ♪

743
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:28,946
       NCIS!

00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:29,980

747
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:44,995
           I got him!

                    Don't shoot!

750
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:49,199
         He's got the detonator!

752
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:02,279
Drop the knife!

00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,148
           (gunshot)

754
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,761
Percy.

755
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,162
You okay?

756
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,497
 Yeah, I'm okay.

757
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,732
      Really? 'Cause, uh,

758
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,467
 you kinda got your ass kicked.

759
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,470
 But I also got the detonator.
        What'd you get?

760
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,138
    Where's Pride?

761
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:50,327
    Didn't think I'd forget
      about you, did you?

762
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:53,196
           What more
   could you possibly want?!

763
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,198
         (keys jangle)

764
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,800
            Nothin'.

765
00:33:56,802 --> 00:34:00,604
Clearwater is safe.

766
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:05,675
Your dream
of a Navy shipyard is finished.
                (groaning)

767
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:09,679
No more innocent people
are gonna get hurt.

768
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,616
Now it's just...

769
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:16,420
       time to settle up.

770
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:21,091
           So, what,
     you're gonna kill me?

771
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:26,296
        And your reward,
      ten years in prison

772
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:30,167
         for assaulting
    and abducting the mayor.

773
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,536
                 Life-- you pull
                   that trigger.

774
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:36,406
     Unless we make a deal.

775
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,679
       I don't think so.

776
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,116
You tried to...

777
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:48,318
     kill me with this gun.

778
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,153
      And that's the least
        of your crimes.

779
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:52,756
Spent your entire career

780
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:56,226
hurting people
for your own personal gain.

781
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:59,129
      And that ends today.

782
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:00,430
  Just, please, listen to me.

783
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,499
                         Please.
    I'd be within my rights
        to take you out,

784
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:05,602
          to kill you.

785
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,705
For everything
you've done to me,

786
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,641
       my team, my city.

787
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,376
           Our city.

788
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:16,880
                'Cause no matter
           what you think of me,

789
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:19,282
   we both love New Orleans!

790
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,254
  Did I make a deal with Stone
       and his employers

791
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,256
  to bring that shipyard here?

792
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,725
       Yes, I did. I did.

793
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:32,596
   For the good of the city!

794
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:35,198
           (sniffles)

795
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,502
         And mistakes were made!

796
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,804
       And I regret that.

797
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:44,141
      And people did die.

798
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:48,512
    But only because I knew that
    we could do something great!

799
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,181
 You have no right to judge me!

800
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:16,206
    I'm not gonna judge you,
            Douglas.

801
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:20,477
Gonna let
the justice system do that.

802
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,816
Douglas Hamilton,

803
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,386
           you are under arrest.

804
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,256
(indistinct police transmission)

805
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:36,426
    Look at me. Look at me.
    Look what he did to me.

806
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:39,296
He shot me, huh? He abducted me.

807
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:41,765
       He threatened me.
 I'm gonna press full charges.

808
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,333
             Shut up, Mr. Mayor.

809
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,702
 It's not over! It's not over!

810
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,505
Deputy Director,

811
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:51,408
I didn't realize
that you were in town.

812
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,677
 I take it I have you to thank

813
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,645
    for getting my team back
         in the field.

814
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,281
       And so much more.

815
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:01,318
            We owe him big-time.
             Hey, do me a favor,

816
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,652
    don't do me any favors.

817
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,721
     Lose my phone number.

818
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,357
How'd you track me down?

819
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,792
             A little profiling.

820
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:10,927
              Figured you'd take
         Hamilton to the source,

821
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:14,931
                   make him face
           everything he's done.

822
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:18,702
You know me well,
for a newbie.

823
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,437
                  Not that well.

824
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,807
         I was wondering whether
        you'd pull that trigger.

825
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,912
Crossed my mind.

826
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,715
               What about Stone?

827
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:35,252
        Do I really want to know
    what went down on that roof?

828
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:38,622
He had a knife.

829
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:42,292
        Was that before or after
         you took his cuffs off?

830
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:45,495
Either way, you need
to get that checked out.

831
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,364
                     I will.

832
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,733
                    Right now,

833
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:52,902
             I just need to sit.

834
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:58,508
You just bagged
the grand prize.

835
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,844
What's next?

836
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:04,047
                     Honestly...

837
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:06,783
                 I have no idea.

838
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:16,660
    Says Isler ran a highly
classified undercover operation

839
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,328
                    to take down
                  Mayor Hamilton

840
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,931
              in a conspiracy of
          corruption and murder.

841
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:24,067
                     And not one
                  mention of us.

842
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,603
That's okay. 'Cause we took down
    the mayor, saved Clearwater,

843
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:27,937
          and got our team back.

844
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,806
                  Let Isler have
                     the credit.
                            Huh?

845
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,809
You were investigating us a few
months ago, and now look at you.

846
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,044
      Part of the family.

847
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:36,546
      Well, I take family
         very serious.

848
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,581
         Well, so do I.
    And we got to get going

849
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,083
       if we're gonna get
      this thing started.

850
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,786
Patton and Wade are
already on their way. Come on.

851
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:45,021
                 (quietly):
                    Hey.

852
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,957
       Can we talk for a second?

853
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,326
     Sure.

854
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,860
       Yeah, it's just...

855
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,595
 with all the craziness lately,

856
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:55,765
I never really got
the chance to thank you.

857
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,702
You really put yourself on the
line for me when I went to jail,

858
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,503
and you kept me safe.

859
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,772
     You even got the judge
         to let me out.

860
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,574
       You would've done
        the same for me.

861
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,576
                   No, no, no.

862
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:10,046
          What I want to say is,
                I appreciate it.

863
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:13,383
              Your support means
            more than I can say.

864
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:16,986
You know, before you do whatever
it is you're about to do,

865
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,988
just hear me out,
all right?

866
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,457
This thing
between us...

867
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:23,126
              Ooh, who says that
                there's a thing?

868
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:26,129
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's nothin', but...

869
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:29,399
                  Yeah, it can't
                  really happen.

870
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:33,803
We just barely kept the team
from falling apart.

871
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,739
          Yeah, I mean, we don't
         need our personal stuff

872
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,807
                  getting in the
                    way of that.
Yeah, we're a family.

873
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,009
All right? We need
to protect that.

874
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,478
For the good
of the team.

875
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,812
                      Yeah.

876
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,881
                     Okay.

877
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,417
           (exhales)

878
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:59,028
