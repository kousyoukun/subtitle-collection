海军罪案调查处: 新奥尔良 前情提要
Previously on NCIS: New Orleans.

2
00:00:02,116 --> 00:00:03,348
我一定要
I'm gonna make damn sure

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,550
让你在监狱里度过...
you spend the rest of your miserable...

4
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:05,918
-啊 -悲惨腐烂的余生
- Ah! - ...corrupt life in prison.

5
00:00:06,184 --> 00:00:07,683
你完了 Dwayne
You are finished, Dwayne.

6
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:08,818
你们玩完了
You are done!

7
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,152
我希望可以说服你们
It's my hope to convince you

8
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:11,120
为什么清水市
why Clearwater

9
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:12,521
是数十年来
<i>is the best candidate</i>

10
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:13,956
在我们国家
<i>for the first naval shipyards</i>

11
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,858
建造首个海军造船厂的最佳城市
<i>to be built in our country</i> <i>in decades.</i>

12
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,493
你想在下个月破土动工
You want to break ground next month,

13
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,295
但还有人仍住在那里
but people are still living on the very site.

14
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:20,429
甚至都没拆迁完毕
It's not even cleared.

15
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,864
我很早以前就应该
<i>Well, I should've</i> <i>stopped Hamilton</i>

16
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:22,965
阻止Hamilton了
a long time ago!

17
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:23,766
他杀了人
He's killed people,

18
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:25,034
如果我现在不做些什么
and more people are gonna die

19
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:26,735
会有更多的人丧命
if I don't do something right now.

20
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:28,003
Pride
Pride.

21
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,572
他需要被处理掉
<i>He needs to be dealt with.</i>

22
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:34,243
不是Pride
It's not Pride.

23
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:36,178
或许他想让其他人以为他死了
Maybe he wants everyone else to think he's dead.

24
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,813
尤其是Hamilton
Especially Hamilton.

25
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:40,549
我只是想确认一下
Just wanted to make sure

26
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:42,284
你还在喘气 Stone先生
you were still breathin', Mr. Stone.

27
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:55,664
啊
Ah...

28
00:00:57,768 --> 00:01:00,336
你是谁
Who are you?

29
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:01,737
我是Stone先生
I'm Mr. Stone.

30
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,405
是
Yeah.

31
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:05,975
我知道你是这么自称的
I know that's what you call yourself,

32
00:01:05,977 --> 00:01:08,611
但我想知道你到底是谁
but I want to know who you are.

33
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:10,212
这很重要吗
Does it matter?

34
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:11,447
你刚刚想杀了我
You tried to kill me.

35
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:12,681
在我们继续之前
Least you can do is tell me

36
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:14,383
至少你可以告诉我你真正的名字
your real name before we proceed.

37
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:15,484
如果你想用
If you think you're gonna scare me

38
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:16,919
这种把戏吓我
into some kind of confession

39
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:18,687
让我认罪的话
with all of these theatrics,

40
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,357
那随便你用什么手段 来吧
then by all means, let's proceed.

41
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,696
Hamilton打算
Hamilton is gonna empty

42
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:29,798
清空清水市 建立一个海军造船厂
Clearwater and build a Navy shipyard.

43
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,300
而我要阻止他
And I'm gonna stop him.

44
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,136
啊
Ah!

45
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:36,605

52

{\a6}S03E10

53
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:47,316
哦 你吓唬不了我
Oh, you're not going to scare me.

54
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:48,984
也羞辱不了我
Or shame me.

55
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,853
即使你可以
Even if you could,

56
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:53,022
这也改变不了什么
it wouldn't change anything.

57
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,991
计划已经在进行了
Plan's in motion.

58
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:58,294
你现在没法阻止了
You can't stop it now.

59
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:07,303
你知道 你现在有很好的机会 Pride
You know, you got a great opportunity here, Pride.

60
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:09,315
每个人都以为你死了
Everyone thinks you're dead.

61
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:11,117
你没有什么可失去的了
You got nothing to lose.

62
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,819
你可以成为任何人
I mean, you can be anyone,

做任何事
do anything.

64
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:21,861
你有一件事说对了 Stone先生
You're right about one thing, Mr. Stone.

65
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:25,899
我没什么可失去的了
I got nothing to lose.

00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,435
这里发生了什么
What's going on here?

75
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:03,870
我也不清楚
I don't have a clue.

76
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:05,705
我收到Swanson的消息 让我快点赶到这里
I got word from Swanson to come down here quickly,

77
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:06,839
我就给你打了电话
so I called you.

78
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:09,108
Lasalle Percy
Lasalle, Percy.

79
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,544
哦 我的天
Oh, my God.

80
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:16,582
听说了Pride的事 我真是太震惊了
I was just so shocked to hear about Pride.

81
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:19,485
我... 我真不敢相信
I mean I... I can't believe it.

82
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:22,121
-是 我知道 -是啊 我们也不敢相信
- Yeah, I know. - Yeah, we can't believe it, either.

83
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,756
你们知道是谁干的吗
You have any idea who did it?

84
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,057
这很复杂
It's complicated.

85
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:26,793
或许我可以帮上忙
Well, I might be able to help.

86
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:30,429
我们认为 受害者是从旁边的楼顶上掉下来的
Victim took a flyer off a nearby roof, we think.

87
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,699
据说 他是杀害Dwayne的嫌疑人
Been told he's a person of interest in Dwayne's murder.

88
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:36,636
我们很感激你打电话通知我们 但是我们团队被停职了
Well, we appreciate the call, but our team was suspended.

89
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:38,171
严格来说 我们不能出现在这里
We can't, technically, be here.

90
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:39,438
严格来说 你们是不可以
Technically, you're not,

91
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,073
否则我就是违反纪律
otherwise my ass is on the line,

92
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:43,042
但这次是有人要求我去联系你们的
but I was asked to reach out.

93
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:44,443
Loretta女士
Ms. Loretta.

94
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:45,845
这不是海岸警卫队的案子
This is not a Coast Guard body.

95
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:47,313
好吗 我们是临时看管
Okay? We're baby-sitting.

96
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:48,815
在警方赶到之前
I'd say you've got about five minutes

97
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:50,716
你们大概有五分钟的时间
before the NOPD shows up.

98
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:52,819
充分利用
Make the most of it.

99
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:54,353
谢谢
Thank you.

100
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:55,788
这出神秘兮兮的戏是怎么回事
What's up with the cloak and dagger?

101
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,124
你说呢
You tell me.

102
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:03,129
Stone
Stone.

103
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:04,931
Hamilton的左膀右臂
Hamilton's right-hand man.

104
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,899
也是最有可能
And the suspect most likely responsible

105
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,568
试图杀害Pride的嫌疑人
for trying to kill Pride.

106
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,735
发生了什么
What happened?

107
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:11,737
手腕上有勒痕
Ligature marks on the wrists,

108
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,106
脸上有挫伤 擦伤
contusions, bruising of the face...

109
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:16,676
他被绑起来打 且很可能是从楼上被扔了下来
He was bound, beaten and probably tossed off a roof.

110
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:19,278
所以 不是自杀
So, not suicide.

111
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,414
不是 但是我找到了一些证据
No, but I found some evidence that--

112
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,950
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to make of it.

113
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:25,751
在这里
Right here.

114
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:27,486
一枚指纹
A fingerprint.

115
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:31,624
是Dwayne的
It's Dwayne's.

116
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,030
Swanson知道吗
Does Swanson know?

117
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:39,432
只有我们三个知道
Only the three of us.

118
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:41,334
很好 我们守住这个秘密
Good. Let's keep it that way.

119
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:43,636
听着 两位 我们需要一个合理的解释
Well, look, you guys. There has to be a good explanation for this.

120
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:47,807
Pride被逼到了极限 Percy
Pride's been pushed to the limit, Percy, all right?

121
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:50,743
为了追查Hamilton 丢掉了工作和团队
Going after Hamilton's cost him his job, his team.

122
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:52,011
牺牲了很多人
It's a lot of bodies.

123
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:53,946
你几天前可没这么说 Lasalle
And you weren't saying this a few days ago, Lasalle.

124
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:55,615
实际上 你当时的说法正好相反
In fact, you were saying the opposite.

125
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:57,283
好吧 但那是在Pride
Yeah, well, that was before Pride

126
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,218
决定玩死亡失踪之前
decided to play dead and disappear.

127
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,853
他有他的理由
He had his reasons.

128
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:02,321
你知道的
You know that.

129
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:03,956
听着 我不想草率下结论
Look, I don't want to jump to conclusions.

130
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:08,661
我还是得把尸体带回去验尸 但是...
I still have to get the body back to autopsy, but...

131
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:11,197
我希望你们可以看住目击者
I wanted you to bear witness.

132
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,965
因为无论Pride在这里做了什么
Because whatever Pride did here,

133
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,433
在你们找到他之前
no one else needs to know about it

134
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:17,436
都不需要让别人知道
until you find him.

135
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,816
我这辈子从没见过这么多的哀悼礼物
I've never seen so many condolence gifts in my life.

136
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:32,451
整个厨房都堆满了
The entire kitchen's filled up.

137
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:34,487
新奥尔良的半数餐馆都送来了一大盘吃的
Half the restaurants in New Orleans sent a platter.

138
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:36,322
是啊 King在这座城市是受人爱戴的
Yeah. King's loved in this city.

139
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:38,524
我让Roy把一些吃的带回家
Well, I told Roy to take some of the food home.

140
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:40,226
他也十分难受
He's pretty broken up, too.

141
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:42,128
我真讨厌不得不假装Pride已经死了
I just hate having to pretend that Pride's dead.

142
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,597
如果我们想让他好好活着并且找到他
Yeah, well, if we want to keep him alive and find him,

143
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:46,532
那么我们就要继续演下去
that's what we're all gonna have to keep doing.

144
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,834
但是 我们到底要怎么才能找到他
Well, uh, how exactly are we supposed to find him, though?

145
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:50,536
我们没有任何职务 没有人力物力
I mean, we don't have any badges, no resources.

146
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,872
实际上 一开始你们就不应该在这儿
In fact, none of you should be here in the first place.

147
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,540
他来这儿干什么
What the hell is he doing here?

148
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,609
我让他过来的 Pride现在不在
I asked him to come. Pride's off the reservation.

149
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:58,411
Hamilton又已经宣战 我们就要被炒鱿鱼了
Hamilton's declared war. We're all gonna lose our jobs,

150
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:00,012
或者好点的话 我们会被派到
or better yet, we're gonna be reassigned

151
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:01,914
一些旮旯里去 我们需要支援
to some backwater. We need help.

152
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,282
所以你就请来了那个
So you called the FBI agent that tried

153
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:04,717
一开始就想瓦解我们团队的FBI探员
to break us apart in the first place?

154
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,319
看来你们可以自己完成
Seems you've been able to accomplish that feat

155
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,920
-这场斗争 -听着 你们说得对
- all on your own. - Look, you're right.

156
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:09,455
-Isler是个让人讨厌的家伙 -嘿
- Isler's a pain in the ass. - Hey.

157
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:11,190
怎么了 他既野心勃勃又墨守成规
What? He's ambitious and a rule-follower,

158
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:12,658
但是你知道吗 他为人刚正自好
but you know what? He's incorruptible,

159
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,961
信守承诺 值得我们去信赖
and a man of his word, and we can trust him.

160
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:16,629
大概可以说声 谢谢
Thanks, I think.

161
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:18,130
他是我们找到Pride的唯一指望
He's our only hope at finding Pride,

162
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:20,333
阻止Hamilton 拯救清水市
stopping Hamilton and saving Clearwater.

163
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:23,069
我讨厌这样
I hate it,

164
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:25,137
但这确实有点道理
but it kind of makes sense.

165
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:29,475
谢谢你的不计前嫌
Well, thank you for your generosity of spirit.

166
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:33,112
现在 Gregorio已经跟我说了案件情况
Now, Gregorio downloaded me on the case.

167
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:34,647
我从这里开始接手
I've got it from here.

168
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,482
我会找到Pride
I will find Pride.

169
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:38,784
-你们现在都可以回家了 -等等 什么 不可能
- You can all go home now. - W-Wait. What? No way.

170
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:40,987
我们不会坐在一边袖手旁观的
Yeah, we're not sitting on the sidelines.

171
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:43,356
那正是你们要做的 而且没得商量
That's precisely what you'll do and it's non-negotiable.

172
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:45,491
好吧 我们谈谈
All right, let's chat.

173
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:49,762
我同意接管 并且挽救你们分崩离析的团队
I agreed to take the reigns and fix what your team broke.

174
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:52,098
但我没有允许你们和Pride一起无法无天
I did not agree to allow you to go rogue along with Pride.

175
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,401
是 你完全正确 我们不应该无法无天
No. You're 100% right; we should not go rogue.

176
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,937
但是你要帮我们恢复职位
But you need to get our badges back.

177
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,739
你们自己的副主任停了你们的职
Your own Deputy Director suspended you.

178
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:01,407
我要怎么给你们复职呢
How am I supposed to change that?

179
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:02,575
因为你可以
'Cause you got pull.

180
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:04,577
是 没错
Yes. I do.

181
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:06,512
但是我不打算把它浪费在
But I'm not about to waste it for a former agent

182
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:08,347
-一个决定放弃职业生涯的前任探员身上 -啊
- who decided to give up her career, - Ah.

183
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,049
让自己变成一个笑话
and run away to the circus.

184
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:13,019
你在逗我吗 你还在生气我调到NCIS这件事吗
Are you kidding me? You're still mad that I came to NCIS?

185
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:15,421
我这辈子一直在寻找适合自己的地方
I spent my life trying to figure out where I fit in,

186
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:17,289
但不在FBI 而是在这儿
and it was not FBI, it was here.

187
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,325
我不会让这儿消失 因为...
And I'm not about to let that disappear because of...

188
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:20,793
说的可真是好啊 Gregorio
That's really beautiful, Gregorio,

189
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,228
但还是于事无补
but it doesn't change a damn thing.

190
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,796
我还没说完 Raymond
I'm not finished, Raymond.

191
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:25,698
如果Dwayne Pride不想被人找到
If Dwayne Pride doesn't want to be found,

192
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,333
他就不会被人找到 不管你在这件案子上
he's not gonna be found. I don't care how many agents

193
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:29,502
出动多少探员
you have on the case.

194
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:31,504
你是想说 我需要你
You're saying that I need you.

195
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:34,974
不是 好吧
No... Okay.

196
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:37,009
我想说的是
What I'm saying is,

197
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:40,179
如果你真的想结束你来这儿接手的事情
if you really want to finish what you started here,

198
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:44,383
谁会比他亲手训练的团队更知道怎么找到他
who better to find him than the team he personally trained?

199
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,088
好了
All right.

200
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,524
我会打电话 让你们恢复职位
I'll make some calls and get your badges back.

201
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,092
现在 回到正题 我们去哪儿找Pride
Now, the case, where are we with finding Pride?

202
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:54,527
我们知道他昨晚和Stone在一起
We know he was with Stone last night,

203
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:55,694
Hamilton的左右手
Hamilton's right-hand man.

204
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:57,530
他从楼顶上丢下来的那个人
Who he threw off a roof.

205
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:59,331
对此我们并不确定
We are not sure about that.

206
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,300
我们找不到Stone的手机
We couldn't find Stone's cell phone.

207
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:02,902
很可能在Pride手里
Pride probably has it.

208
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:04,570
好的 那我去追踪手机
All right, well, I'll work on tracking the phone.

209
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:06,672
希望他和其他作业人员处在同样的网络
Hoping he's on the same network as the other operatives.

210
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:08,307
好 Stone的尸体在解剖室
All right, Stone's body is in autopsy.

211
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:09,675
既然我们已经复职了
Since we've been reinstated,

212
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:11,243
Percy和我去找Wade
Percy and I will go talk to Wade.

213
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:13,012
看她有没有发现更多的线索
See if she's got any more evidence.

214
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:14,647
你呢
How about you?

215
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,382
知道你的老大可能会去什么地方吗
Any clue as to where your boss may be headed?

216
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:19,218
不知道
Nope.

217
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,287
但我知道他在找谁
But I know who he's after.

218
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,123
你不可以进去
You cannot go inside.

219
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,858
市长整个早上都在进行闭门会议
The mayor's in a locked-door meeting all morning.

220
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,693
不好意思 女士 我们现在就要跟他谈
No, sorry, ma'am. We need to talk to him now.

221
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:28,928
刻不容缓
This can't wait.

222
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,029
当然要谈
It's gonna have to.

223
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,697
但是你 请你离开
And you... you need to leave.

224
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:33,099

我需要进去里面
and I need to get in there.

229
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,806
我当然知道你是谁
Yeah, I know exactly who you are.

230
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,108
我们认为市长有危险
We believe the mayor's in danger.

231
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,442
对 她这样的人就是危险
Yeah, from people like her.

232
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:44,743
在法国区的枪战

233
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,011
开车冲进人声沸腾的餐馆
car running into a crowded restaurant,

234
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:49,315
一切都拜Dwayne Pride和NCIS所赐
all courtesy of Dwayne Pride and NCIS.

235
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:52,084
他已经离开人世了 好吗 放尊重点
Whoa. He's no longer with us, okay? Have a little respect.

236
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:54,253

我是FBI的副局长Isler

00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:47,054
至少警方的犯罪现场侦查技术人员是这么说的
I mean, at least, according to NOPD crime scene techs,

280
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:49,356
但我 我真不敢相信是Pride干的
but I, I can't believe that Pride did it.

281
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,891
我们也不相信是他把那家伙从楼顶推下来的
We couldn't believe he threw that guy off the roof, either.

282
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,860
嘿 我们并不知道是他干的
Hey, we don't know that he did that.

283
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:55,629
尸检的时候你就在我旁边 Percy
You were just with me at autopsy, Percy.

284
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:56,897
Wade医生说
Doc Wade said

285
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,066
Stone是被外力强推下楼顶的
that Stone was forcibly thrown off that roof.

286
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:00,201
等等 什么
Wait, what?

287
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:01,635
你怎么回事儿啊 Lasalle
What is it with you, Lasalle?

288
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:03,237
你认识那人都十几年了
You've known that man for over ten years.

289
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,272
你一直那么支持他 现在突然
You always have his back, and now all of a sudden

290
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:06,474
你就觉得他失控了
you think he's gone off the rails?

291
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:07,808
我也不愿意这么想
Yeah, I don't want to.

292
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,044
但是能让Pride奔溃的人
But if Pride's got a breaking point,

293
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:11,345
肯定是Hamilton
it's Hamilton.

294
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:13,280
那我们就找到他
So let's find him.

295
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:15,416
对了 Wade...
Look, uh, Wade...

296
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:18,452
在Stone衣服上发现了这个外来物质
got this foreign substance off of Stone's clothes.

297
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:20,421
-你能分析成分么 -嗯 没问题
- Can you analyze it? - Yeah, will do.

298
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:23,190
但是我要先给你们看点儿东西
But, uh, look, I want to show you guys something first.

299
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:25,659
这是Hamilton被绑现场的轮胎碾压轨迹
It's the tire treads from the Hamilton crime scene.

300
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:28,295
Pride可能就是用这辆车把他带走的
This could be the car that Pride took him in.

301
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:29,830
再说详细点
Can you get us details?

302
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,599
费尔斯通的轮胎 摩擦力很强
Yeah, Firestone, deep traction.

303
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,767
可能是年份很新的美国产小轿车
Probably from a late model American sedan.

304
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:36,470
应该是一辆银色的克莱斯勒300
I'm thinking a silver Chrysler 300.

305
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:39,139
你能从轮胎的痕迹推断出车的颜色么
So you got the color of the car off of some tire tracks?

306
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:40,241
不是 我比对了
Well, I did when I cross-referenced

307
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:41,775
离Pride酒吧一个街区的监控录像
the tire treads to surveillance

308
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:43,444
在爆炸结束后
that was taken about a block away

309
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:44,879
过路车辆的轮胎碾压痕迹
from Pride's bar after it exploded.

310
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:47,481
我猜这应该是Stone的车
I'm guessing that this was Stone's car,

311
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:49,917
-然后Pride把它开走了 -啊 啊 啊 啊
- and then Pride took it. - Ah, ah, ah, ah.

312
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,453
FBI才请我过去一分钟
The man is under FBI investigation for a hot minute,

313
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,688
-看把他能的 -我刚要提到你
- and look how he's treated. - I was gonna mention you.

314
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,856
你回来太好了 P
I'm glad you're back, P.

315
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:56,991
不能更好了 宝贝
And better than ever, baby.

316
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:58,192
没你还是不一样
Hasn't been the same without you.

317
00:11:58,194 --> 00:12:00,961
当然了 但是说回正事儿
Of course not. But back to business.

318
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:03,297
我在市里的监控录像系统里找到了这段录像
I accessed the city's surveillance cameras for this footage.

319
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,766
-还能找到更多么 -我还在找
- And can you find more? - I'm working on it--

320
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,468
但是要找的范围太大了
but that's a lot of city miles to cover.

321
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,469
老大可能在任何地方
Boss man could be anywhere.

322
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:10,004
不是任何地方
Not just anywhere.

323
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:12,640
我们对Pride这个人很了解
Look, we all know Pride inside and out.

324
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:15,943
不管他有多么想把Hamilton拉下马
And I don't care how obsessed he is with bringing Hamilton down,

325
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,846
如果他受伤了 他肯定会救他的
if that man is hurt, he's gonna try to fix him.

326
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:22,550
是啊 而且那个人还有他想知道的答案呢
Yeah, especially if he's got information he wants.

327
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:30,491
我需要一家医院 不是一个创可贴
I need a hospital, not a Band-Aid.

328
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:32,092
我知道你很生气
I know you're pissed,

329
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:34,361
但我从没想过把枪口对准你
but I never meant to draw that gun on you.

330
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:35,696
你派了Stone来杀我
You sent Stone to kill me.

331
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:37,598
他跟你这么说的么 真能编
Is that what he said? He's a liar.

332
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,533
Stone死了
Stone's dead.

333
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:41,969
你的清水市计划的殉葬者名单里
Add him to the list of people who've paid

334
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,771
又多了他一个
for your Clearwater plan.

335
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:47,074
我没什么计划
I don't have a plan.

336
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:48,943
我没有计划
I don't have a plan.

337
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:53,581
我只是想拆除
I am revitalizing...

338
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,549
一个灾后的街区
a blighted neighborhood.

339
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,651
是夷平这个地方去盖一个造船厂
By razing the area for a shipyard!

340
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,354
我完全不知道你在说什么
I literally have no idea what you're talking about.

341
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:05,125
喂
Hello.

342
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:06,794
Stone 我是Johan 一切准备就绪
Stone, it's Johan. Team's in place.

343
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:08,696
行动倒计时三小时开始
Operation's a go. Three-hour countdown.

344
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,564
进行最后确认
Final confirmation.

345
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:16,470
行动取消
Confirmation denied.

346
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:19,106
你不是Stone
You're not Stone.

347
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:22,977
谁是Johan
Who's Johan?

348
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:25,646
-行动是什么 -Dwayne 你 Dwayne...
- Huh? What's the operation? - Dwayne. You know, Dwayne...

349
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:26,981
嘿 Dwayne
Hey. Dwayne...

350
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:29,016
-告诉我啊 -Dwayne
- You're gonna tell me. - Dwayne,

351
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:31,196
你不给我找医生 我会失血过多而死的
I'm gonna bleed to death unless you get me to a doctor.

352
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,753
不 不 不
No, no, no.

353
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,253
还不能死
Not just yet.

354
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,459
喂
Hello?

355
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:39,259
Loretta
Loretta...

356
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:40,561
Dw... 嘿
Dw... Hey.

357
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:41,662
有什么事吗
What's going on?

358
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:43,130
你旁边有人么
Are you alone?

359
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:44,398
有啊
No.

360
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
到处都是警察
The police are everywhere.

361
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:47,968
你是不是绑架了市长
Did you kidnap the mayor?

362
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,902
不 我不管这叫绑架
No, I wouldn't call it kidnapping.

363
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:50,838
-我觉得是 -听着
- Yeah, I would. - Okay, listen.

364
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,473
不能让任何人知道我跟你打电话
You can't let anybody know that we're talking.

365
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:53,474
Hamilton没事儿吧
Is Hamilton okay?

366
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:55,242
Hamilton有事儿
Hamilton is <i>not</i> okay.

367
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:56,677
他的上臂中了一枪
He's got a bullet in his upper arm.

368
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,245
现在失血过快 按也按不住
He's bleeding fast, even with pressure.

369
00:13:58,247 --> 00:13:59,647
送他去看医生啊
He needs a doctor.

370
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:00,948
不行 所以我才打给你
No, that's why I called you.

371
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,750
帮我把子弹取出来
To help me remove the bullet.

372
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:04,618
你在哪 我这就过去
Where are you? I'll come.

373
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,920
别晕过去 别晕过去
Stay with me. Stay with me.

374
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:09,757
-Dwayne 你在干什么啊 -我要完成我没做完的事儿
- Dwayne, what are you doing? - I'm finishing what I started.

375
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,260
得让Hamilton多活一小会儿
Requires Hamilton to survive a little longer.

376
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:14,662
现在 告诉我怎么做
Now, tell me what to do.

377
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:16,130
好吧
Okay, uh...

378
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:18,499
你要按住肱动脉
you need to put pressure on the brachial artery.

379
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,967
就在腋窝下边一点
It's just below the armpit.

380
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:21,969
应该能帮助止血
Should help with hemostasis.

381
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:26,340
嗯 有用
Yeah, it's working.

382
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:27,941
现在把胳膊绑起来
Now you need to tie off the arm.

383
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:30,110
要够紧 阻止血液循环
Tight enough to stop circulation flow.

384
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:33,614
要是没有医生 可能会造成进一步损伤
Which could cause further trauma if he doesn't see a doctor.

385
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:42,256
你在干什么
What are you doing?

386
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:43,290
Loretta
Loretta...

387
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,491
你在干什么
What are you doing?

388
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:45,893
Loretta 你有告诉别人我在电话这头吗
Loretta, you tell anybody I was on the phone?

389
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:47,061
绝对没有
Absolutely not.

390
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:49,229
停下 噢
Stop. Oh...

391
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:54,435
你身上有追踪器
You've got a tracking device?

392
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:56,637
我身上当然有追踪器
Of course I've got a tracking device.

393
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,740
毕竟有你这疯子在跟踪我 不是么
I got maniacs like you following me, don't I?

394
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:01,875
Loretta 告诉其他人
Loretta, tell the others...

395
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:05,012
Stone在清水市有别的势力
Stone has another team in play in Clearwater.

396
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:07,014
三小时后肯定会有事情发生
Something's happening in the next three hours.

397
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:09,249
Dwayne 等等 Dway Dwayne
Dwayne, wait. Dway... Dwayne!

398
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:12,352
走 走 你往右
Move! Move! You go right!

399
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,489
安全
Clear!

400
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:16,757
安全
Clear!

401
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:32,649
我们有麻烦了
We got problems.

402
00:15:32,651 --> 00:15:35,505
警方在市长身上藏了一个GPS芯片
NOPD used a GPS chip hidden on the mayor

403
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:36,959
追踪到他去了一家关闭的医疗诊所
to track him to a shuttered medical clinic.

404
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,493
他不见了 和Pride一块儿
He was gone, along with Pride.

405
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,095
需要知道他们现在在哪里
Need to know where they are now.

406
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:41,796
Patton搜查了监控录像
Patton searched surveillance cameras.

407
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:44,699
Stone的车驶离了诊所
Stone's car was driving away from the clinic.

408
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,935
然后就消失了
Then it went off the grid.

409
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,203
我向你保证
I assure you

410
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:49,804
我们不是唯一有这画面的人
we're not the only ones with that image.

411
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:51,673
警方会发现Pride还活着
It's only a matter of time before NOPD

412
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:53,375
并且Hamilton在他手上 这只是时间问题
figures out that Pride's alive and has Hamilton.

413
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:55,210
是 他知道他被追踪了
Yeah, he'll be harder to find now that he knows

414
00:15:55,212 --> 00:15:57,011
-就更难找了 -答案很简单
- he's being tracked. - The answer's simple.

415
00:15:57,013 --> 00:16:00,682
我们联系警方的Estes队长 告诉他所有事情
We contact Captain Estes at NOPD and tell him everything.

416
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:03,118
不不 我们这么做 他们会认为Pride绑架了市长
Uh-uh, we do that, they'll assume Pride kidnapped the mayor.

417
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,019
他会成为头号公敌
He'll be public enemy number one.

418
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,855
他确实绑架了市长
He <i>did</i> kidnap the mayor.

419
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:08,890
听着 你一直以为Pride离开这里
Look, you're under the impression that Pride

420
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:10,458
出去冲锋陷阵 执行某种神圣使命
went off the reservation on some holy mission

421
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,828
拯救这座城市 但或许他就是失控了
to save the city-- perhaps he just went off.

422
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,531
他告诉Wade 在清水市还有秘密行动人员
He told Wade that there were more operatives in Clearwater.

423
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,967
他还在试图拯救这个社区
He's still trying to save the neighborhood.

424
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:20,435
问题是 我们没法了解
Problem is, we're no closer to figuring out

425
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,404
Hamilton清空清水市的计划
Hamilton's plan to empty Clearwater.

426
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,205
事实上 我们已经很接近了
Actually, we're a lot closer.

427
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:26,775
我刚分析了Stone衣服上的微量物
I just analyzed the trace found on Stone's clothing.

428
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,643
是TATB爆炸物
It's TATB explosives.

429
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,643
{\a6}三氨基三硝基苯

430
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:30,845
高能钝感炸药 意味着方便运输
It's highly insensitive, which means it's easy to transport,

431
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:32,514
而且 威力极大
and it's... very powerful.

432
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:35,083
-Stone炸毁了Pride的酒吧 -不是用那个炸的
- Stone blew up Pride's bar. - Not with that.

433
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:36,885
那是用来引爆子弹头的
That's used to detonate warheads.

434
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:39,287
-Stone的行动有别的目的 -是啊
- Stone's operatives have another plan. - Yeah, well,

435
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,222
他们在计划一些大事情 大到需要
they're taking something out-- something big enough

436
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:42,411
让清水市的居民永远离开
to drive the residents out of Clearwater for good.

437
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,659
是啊 清水市
Yeah, Clearwater

438
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,260
面积很大 我们没法凭自己
is big-- there's no way we find

439
00:16:45,262 --> 00:16:46,661
找到那些爆炸物
those explosives on our own.

440
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:48,663
-那我们告诉Estes队长 -不
- Then we loop in Captain Estes. - No.

441
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:49,998
我们不能相信警方
NOPD can't be trusted.

442
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,966
但我知道有个人可以相信
But I know someone who can.

443
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:54,969
是Estes
That's Estes.

444
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,171
我受够了这种伪装的把戏
I'm done with this charade.

445
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,808
Estes队长 我们需要谈谈Hamilton市长的事情
Captain Estes, we need to talk about Mayor Hamilton.

446
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,042
-Isler 等等 -抱歉
- Isler, wait. - I'm sorry,

447
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:02,644
有人刚走进了我的办公室
somebody just walked into my office.

448
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,312
请听我说完 拜托了
Just hear me out. Please.

449
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,681
对不起 我会马上给你打回来
I'm sorry, I'll call you right back.

450
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:08,616
Pride在外面想要从Hamilton那里
Pride's out there trying to get answers

451
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:09,884
找到答案
from Hamilton.

452
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:11,386
如果你真的想弄清这些事情
If you really want to sort this out,

453
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,188
你需要给我们更多的时间
you need to give us more time.

454
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,456
用支持绑架的方式么
By abetting kidnapping?

455
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,824
不只是你的小命不保
Won't just be <i>your</i> ass on the line,

456
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,225
-我也会成为目标的 -好吧
- target'll be on my back, too. - All right,

457
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:18,526
我们实话实说 当你到这里的时候
let's just be honest-- target's been

458
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:20,061
你就已经是目标了
on your back since you got here.

459
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:21,629
我知道你为什么想要我在这里
I know why you wanted me here.

460
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:22,931
-不 -你想要回你的警徽
- No. - You wanted your badges back,

461
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:24,065
并且让我不要插手这事情
and you wanted me to step aside,

462
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:24,999
但这不是我工作的方式
but that's not how I work.

463
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,968
-我要给Estes打电话 -一旦你把
- I'm calling Estes. - The minute you

464
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,703
Pride活着的消息说出去 会引发全面出击的
tell them Pride's alive, it'll be full-court press.

465
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:31,272
警方根本不在乎拯救清水市
NOPD doesn't give a crap about saving Clearwater.

466
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:34,175
你会毁了Pride所有的奋斗成果
You will undercut everything Pride's fought for.

467
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:36,945
拜托
Come on.

468
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:38,913
帮我 也帮Pride
Help me help Pride.

469
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:40,448
拜托了
Please.

470
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:43,051
我给你两个小时
I'll give you two hours

471
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,986
去找出爆炸物在哪里
to figure out where those explosives are.

472
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:48,323
好的 谢谢
Okay. All right, thanks.

473
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:54,095
Dwayne
<i>Dwayne.</i>

474
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,364
Dwayne 我们得停下来
<i>Dwayne, we got to stop.</i>

475
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,866
我需要帮助
I need help.

476
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:03,771
清水市大教堂 是吧
Clearwater Baptist, huh?

477
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:06,007
这是什么 又是在暗喻
What is this, another metaphor for...

478
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:08,276
我应该去见耶稣么
my "come to Jesus" moment?

479
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:11,179
你已经过了忏悔的阶段了
You're way past repenting.

480
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:13,548
你也没有选择了
And you're way out of options.

481
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,316
谁是Johan
Who's Johan?

482
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:17,485
计划是什么
What is the plan?

483
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:18,720
不然呢
Or what?

484
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,788
你不会杀我的
You're not gonna kill me.

485
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,891
Stone说过同样的话
Stone said the same thing,

486
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,927
看看他发生了什么
and look what happened to him.

487
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:29,137
无论你对他做了什么 他活该
Well, he deserved whatever you did to him.

488
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:30,199
你要告诉我
You gonna tell me

489
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,500
Stone对这一切负责么
that Stone's responsible for all this?

490
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:35,803
用毒品交易的钱 买下清水市的房产
Using drug money to buy property in Clearwater,

491
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:38,239
对我的团队进行人身攻击 都是Stone的责任么
the personal attacks on my team-- Stone's responsible?

492
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,208
利用了
Taking advantage

493
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,776
我想对一个挣扎中的城市
of my desire to help

494
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:43,811
施以援手的愿望
a struggling area of this city.

495
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,247
引入成千上万的工作机会
Bringing in thousands of jobs.

496
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:48,449
我唯一做错的是
And the only thing I'm guilty of is caring

497
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:49,751
对这个城市过分关心了
about this city <i>too</i> much.

498
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,054
连你也不是那么擅长说谎啊
Even you are not that good a liar.

499
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:55,089
那你怎么不说呢
Then why don't you come in?

500
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:56,824
去说啊
Come on in, then!

501
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:59,561
你说你的版本 我说我的
And you tell your version and I'll tell mine!

502
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:01,663
你觉得他们会相信谁的故事
And who do you think they're gonna believe?

503
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:04,432
某些在逃的联邦探员
Some... fugitive federal agent

504
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,335
还是新奥尔良备受尊重的市长
or the respected mayor of New Orleans?

505
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:10,004
你没有退路了
You got no moves left here.

506
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:11,673
我有
I got one.

507
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:13,641
我没指望你会顿悟
I wasn't expecting an epiphany.

508
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:16,077
只是赌了你的动机
Just betting on the only motive

509
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,346
你唯一在乎的动机
that's ever mattered to you.

510
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:20,448
自我保护
Self-preservation.

511
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,450
你在干什么
What are you doing?

512
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,086
我带你来这里 不是为了什么清水市的隐喻
I didn't bring you here as a metaphor to Clearwater.

513
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:26,888
这是最后的保障
This is ground zero.

514
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,725
不管这里会发生什么
Whatever's about to happen here...

515
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:33,394
也都会发生在你身上
will happen to you, too.

516
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:38,566
Pride还活着么
Pride is alive?

517
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,336
你们一定是在开玩笑吧
You got to be kidding me.

518
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:42,704
我还送了花
I sent flowers.

519
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:44,539
是啊 这花选得很有品位
Yeah, it was a very tasteful arrangement.

520
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,641
如果你想要的话 你可以带回去
And you can have them back if you want.

521
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,076
呃 不用 我
Uh, no. I...

522
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:50,845
如果可以的话 我们今天早上就告诉你了
We would have told you this morning if we could.

523
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,981
这是某种卧底行动吗
Is this some kind of undercover operation?

524
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,217
呃 算是吧 是的 情况有点复杂
Uh, sort of, yeah. It's-it's a little complicated.

525
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:59,253
我们告诉你越多 你越会被连累
Listen, the more we tell you, the more compromised you'll be.

526
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:01,322
目前的情况不完全是合法的
The situation's not exactly kosher.

527
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:02,957
好吧 告诉我需要知道的部分
Well, give me the Reader's Digest.

528
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,627
好的 我们认为Hamilton市长
Okay. Well, we think Mayor Hamilton

529
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:07,095
安排了一队人
has a team of operatives

530
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:09,430
在清水市安装炸弹
planting an explosive device in Clearwater.

531
00:20:09,432 --> 00:20:12,066
是的 我一直在研究一份潜在目标的清单
Yeah, and I've been working on a list of potential targets.

532
00:20:12,068 --> 00:20:15,837
有化工厂 废水处理厂
There is a chemical plant, sewage treatment facility,

533
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,372
电站
electrical grid station,

534
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:19,507
也可能是人口密集区
or it could be a population center,

535
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,109
比如杂货店或者学校
like a grocery store or a school.

536
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:23,144
也就是说 我们不知道在哪里
In other words, we don't know jack.

537
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:26,414
所以把我叫来 你们需要海岸警卫队的技术设备
Which is why I'm here-- you need Coast Guard tech.

538
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,050
你们有前视红外雷达摄影机可以监测热信号
You've got that FLIR camera that can detect heat signatures.

539
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,052
是的 但是得保密
Yeah, but it's got to be hush-hush.

540
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:32,820
因为不大合法
Because it's not exactly kosher.

541
00:20:32,822 --> 00:20:34,856
而且行动得快
And we got to move fast.

542
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,492
好吧 我会发动空中和地面的力量
Well, I'll get the bird in the air and boots on the ground.

543
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:40,395
-你们来吗 -是 我去
- You coming? - Yeah, I'll go.

544
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:42,397
听着 我会在这待着
Listen, I'm gonna stick around.

545
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:44,632
赶在别人之前 找到Pride和Hamilton的位置
Try and locate Pride and Hamilton before anyone else.

546
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,134
收到
You got it.

547
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,517
CGIS NCIS地面单位 这里是6592号
<i>CGIS and NCIS ground, 6592,</i>

548
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,517
{\a6}CGIS: 海岸警卫队调查处

549
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,986
正在清水市上空 开始进行S型搜索
<i>overhead Clearwater, beginning</i> <i>Sierra Sierra search pattern.</i>

550
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:08,189
收到 我们在路上
<i>Copy that. We are in transit.</i>

551
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:12,460
稍等
Wait a minute.

552
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:14,262
前视红外雷达摄像机捕捉到一个反常的热信号
<i>The FLIR camera's picking up</i> <i>an abnormal heat signature</i>

553
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:15,763
来自一辆水电运输车
<i>It's from a power</i> <i>and water truck</i>

554
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,832
停在Adelaide和Fulton之间
parked off Adelaide and Fulton.

555
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:20,001
我们就到
We're on it.

556
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:25,406
NCIS
NCIS!

557
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:35,683
有个人跑了
We got a runner!

558
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,088
NCIS 站住
NCIS! Stop!

559
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,533
发现一具尸体
We got a body.

560
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:54,068
像是保安
Some kind of security guard.

561
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:57,205
炸药
Explosives.

562
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,674
但我猜这里原本还有更多
But I'm guessing there was a lot more back here.

563
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:01,008
伙计们 我们遇到了另一个问题
Guys, we got another problem.

564
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,244
那个嫌疑人刚刚发送了"超级工厂"病毒
That suspect just sent out a Stuxnet worm.

565
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:06,447
我们都不知道那是什么
None of us knows what that is.

566
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:07,815
它是种恶意病毒
I-It's a malicious virus.

567
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:09,450
它会感染可编程逻辑控制器
It infects programmable logic controllers.

568
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:11,786
呃 重写机械加工工艺流程
Uh, overrides mechanical processes.

569
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,154
它是专门针对
It was specifically designed

570
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:14,589
工业控制系统编写的病毒
to take out industrial computer systems.

571
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,290
好吧 它的目标是什么
All right, what's it targeting?

572
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:19,660
它刚感染了工业运河系统
They just infected the Industrial Canal.

573
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:34,041
海岸警卫队6592号 我们能看到南边的水闸
<i>CG 6592, we have a visual</i> <i>on the south lock.</i>

574
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:37,178
闸门开了 水冲进了运河
<i>Gates are opening.</i> <i>Water's rushing into the canal.</i>

575
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:48,356
Dwayne
Dwayne.

576
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:50,158
Dwayne 你听到了 对吗
Dwayne, you hear that, right?

577
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,360
洪水警报
Flood warning sirens.

578
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:54,562
不要转变话题
Don't change the subject.

579
00:22:54,564 --> 00:22:57,031
你得开口坦白
Need to start talking.

580
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,833
但是 呃
But, uh...

581
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,368
我们应该离开
we should leave.

582
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,037
这种警报在春季每周会响两次
Those sirens go off twice a week in the spring.

583
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,806
通常是演习
Usually a drill.

584
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:06,207
呃
Uh...

585
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:08,442
小心驶得万年船 对吧
better safe than sorry, though, right?

586
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,647
你紧张了
You nervous?

587
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,284
紧张吗 我快失血而亡了
Nervous? Well, I'm bleeding to death,

588
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:18,186
还被一个凶狠的联邦探员绑架 所以
being held hostage by a rogue federal agent, so...

589
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,787
但这是
And yet this is

590
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:22,790
我第一次看到你害怕
the first time I've actually seen you scared.

591
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,364
你不是要把这些人赶走
You're not gonna push these people out.

592
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:33,434
你是要把他们冲走
You're gonna wash 'em out.

593
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:35,436
你要淹没清水市
You're flooding Clearwater.

594
00:23:35,438 --> 00:23:37,338
这真是 荒谬
That's-that's... ridiculous.

595
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,806
毁灭这个地区
Devastate the area.

596
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,007
重新安置居民
Relocate the residents.

597
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,442
建造你的船坞
Build your shipyard.

598
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:43,044
如果我说是
Look, if I say yes,

599
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,745
你会为我打开手铐吗
will you uncuff me?

600
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:46,714
你找到了方法
You found a way

601
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,884
让水位升高 但是
to make the river rise. And yet

602
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,220
这还不够
that's not enough.

603
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,525
在卡特里娜飓风之后 他们加固了水闸门
After Katrina, they strengthened the floodgates.

604
00:23:57,527 --> 00:24:01,295
再多几英尺的水也不会...
Few extra feet of water wouldn't...

605
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:04,298
Dwayne 我是认真的
Dwayne, seriously...

606
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,234
我们得走了
we got to go!

607
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,905
你要炸掉防洪闸
You're taking out the floodgates.

608
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,548
你要去哪里
Where you going?

609
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,384
我要彻底终止你开启的灾难
I'm gonna stop what you started once and for all.

610
00:24:23,386 --> 00:24:25,887
但是如果我们被洪水淹了
But if we get flooded here

611
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:28,356
我将在九英尺深[约2.7米]的水下
I'll be under nine feet of water!

612
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:32,426
你最好祈祷我能拯救这一切
Better hope I save the day.

613
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:45,439
啊 啊
Ah... aah!

614
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,659
Stone的人入侵了城市的基础设施
Stone's operatives were able to hack into city infrastructure.

615
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,728
在整个工业运河上禁用了河闸控制系统
Disable the lock systems across the whole Industrial Canal.

616
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,996
这意味着水将自由地
That means water's flowing freely

617
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,631
从运河流入Pontchartrain湖
from the river to Lake Pontchartrain.

618
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,899
对 如果其中一处大坝决堤
Yeah, if one of those levees breaches, then the water

619
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,502
水会转向 开始淹没清水市
would change course and start flooding Clearwater.

620
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,970
这就是炸弹的作用
That's what the explosives are for:

621
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,772
炸毁一处大坝 淹没清水市
to take out a levee, then take out Clearwater.

622
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:09,790
你能反入侵吗
Can you reverse the hack?

623
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:10,968
在Patton的帮助下 也许能行
I mean, maybe with Patton's help.

624
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:11,698
去做
Get to it.

625
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:13,044
基于卡车上的证据判断
And based on the evidence in the truck

626
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,945
还有更多携带炸药的嫌疑人
there are more suspects with explosives.

627
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,581
还有在河畔入口工作的保安尸体
And the body of a security guard who works riverside access.

628
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,883
嫌疑犯在某处水面上 可能在
Suspects are somewhere on the water. Probably rigging

629
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:20,984
-给大坝钻孔 -但是哪一个呢
- a levee. － But which one?

630
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,319
我们有巡逻队
We have patrols

631
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,187
在巡查运河 但是运河太长
sweeping the waterways. It's a lot of miles to cover.

632
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,823
我们没法保证在爆炸之前就找到正确的坝口
And there's no guarantee we find the right levee before it blows.

633
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,092
要疏散清水市以防万一 但这会很麻烦
Evacuating Clearwater just in case, but it's gonna be tough.

634
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,694
我们还得挨家挨户
We have to go house to house to make sure

635
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,762
确认人们离开 然而我们这里没有足够人力
that people leave, and we have no manpower here.

636
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,231
我会给你提供增援
I'll get you those reinforcements.

637
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,732
给我找到这些嫌疑犯
Find me those suspects.

638
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,168
King是Katrina飓风后的第一周
King was part of river rescue

639
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,536
就参与河流救援的人
for the first week of Katrina.

640
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,471
随后调查过堤坝的破坏情况
Investigated levee breaches afterward.

641
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,807
他肯定知道哪处堤坝是最脆弱的
He has to have an idea which levee's most vulnerable.

642
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,040
哦 你现在不再觉得他疯了吗
Oh, so you don't think he's gone crazy anymore?

643
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,844
我从没觉得他疯了 Percy
I never thought he was crazy, Percy.

644
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,779
他完全有理由把Hamilton除掉
He has every right to take Hamilton out.

645
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,182
我只希望他不要越线
I just hope he chooses not to cross the line.

646
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,150
我们去河边 看看我们能否追踪到
Let's head to the river and see if we can't retrace

647
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,119
卡车的行动轨迹
the truck's movements.

648
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,043
可恶
Oh, damn it.

649
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,579
调度处 这里是49号巡逻车
Dispatch, this is unit 49.

650
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,848
我刚看到一辆被已被通缉的
<i>I've got a visual</i> <i>on a late-model sedan wanted</i>

651
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,683
涉及市长绑架案的新型轿车
in connection with the mayor's abduction.

652
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,653
49号车 收到 六区的所有可用小队
<i>10-4, 49. Any</i> <i>available 6th district unit,</i>

653
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,921
49号车在Felicity街2500区发现一辆汽车
<i>49 has a vehicle</i> <i>matching the descript</i>

654
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,556
与绑架市长的绑匪车辆
<i>of the mayor's abductors</i>

655
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,824
描述相符合
in the 2500 block of Felicity,

656
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,060
正转弯进入Terpsichore街
turning onto Terpsichore.

657
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,864
那肯定是Pride
That's got to be Pride.

658
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,900
警方几分钟前刚发现他从清水市出来
NOPD just spotted him coming out of Clearwater a minute ago.

659
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,468
没有看到市长
No sign of the mayor.

660
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,704
你怎么有这个画面
How'd you get this feed?

661
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,673
算了 别回答
Never mind. Don't answer.

662
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,875
更大的问题是 警方盯上Pride了
The bigger issue is NOPD's onto Pride.

663
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,344
就我们说话的时候 他们已经派出骑兵了
And they're bringing in the cavalry as we speak.

664
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,896
驾驶员 赶快熄火
Driver, turn off the ignition.

665
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,032
手伸出窗外
Hands out the window.

666
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,902
你被包围了
You're surrounded.

667
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,072
按我们说的做
Comply with our instructions

668
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,708
否则我们将开枪
or we will shoot.

669
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,311
-他在搞什么啊 -他在向河边前进
- What the hell is he doing? - He's heading to the river.

670
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,081
-他肯定知道河坝的事了 -猜得好 Gregorio
- He must know about the levees. - That's a reach, Gregorio.

671
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,816
-他已经绝望了 -我们得帮他
- He's desperate. - We need to help him.

672
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,417
真的 如果我们什么也不做
Seriously. If we don't do something,

673
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,386
就会眼睁睁看着他在大街上死掉
we're gonna watch him die on that street.

674
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,189
-Isler  -我知道 Gregorio
- Isler. - I know, Gregorio.

675
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,657
我知道
I know.

676
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,726
让我想想
Let me think.

677
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,071
他在拿什么东西
He's reaching for something.

678
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,940
角度没问题 可以射击
I've got a clean shot.

679
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,808
等待命令射击
Standing by for your go.

680
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,087
拿着
Hold this.

681
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,455
你是谁
Who am I speaking with?

682
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,691
我是Isler副局长
This is Deputy Director Isler.

683
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,594
你需要仔细听我说
You need to listen very carefully to me.

684
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,897
如果你和你的人现在不退下
If you and your men don't stand down this moment,

685
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,900
我们的职业生涯今晚都会完蛋
all of our careers will be over by tonight.

686
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,302
Dwayne Pride在那辆车上
Dwayne Pride is in that car

687
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,839
他是我安插的卧底
and he's working undercover for me.

688
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,321
好的 我们正在让开
All right. We're standing down.

689
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,312
谢谢你
Thank you.

690
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,114
但愿我们这么做是对的
I truly hope we got this right.

691
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,717
我刚收到一条短信
I just got a text.

692
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,319
-我也是 -来自一个未知号码
- So did I. - It's from an unknown number.

693
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,854
只说了"佛罗里达街大坝"
All it says is "Florida Street Levee."

694
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,289
对 这是Pride
Yeah, that's Pride.

695
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,324
这肯定是不法分子正在破坏的目标
It must be what the operatives are sabotaging.

696
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,194
我们得给Lasalle和Sonja打电话
We need to call Lasalle and Sonja now.

697
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:38,071
我们暴露了
We've been exposed!

698
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:40,338
现在就爆破
Set the detonator now!

699
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:53,752
我们在佛罗里达街
We're on Florida Street.

700
00:30:53,754 --> 00:30:56,188
我们发现了Stone的车 没发现Pride
We found Stone's car, but no sign of Pride.

701
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,422
他肯定是跟着Stone其他手下
He's got to be somewhere there,

702
00:30:57,424 --> 00:30:59,291
到了那儿的某个地方
along with the rest of Stone's men.

703
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:01,026
-我们要搜查整片地区 -好 你们最好
- Yeah, we're gonna sweep the area. - All right, well, you better

704
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,327
快一点 因为这些爆炸物
hurry up, because those explosives

705
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,728
可能会随时爆炸
could go off at any moment.

706
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,497
如果你能关上闸门
It would help if you could close the locks,

707
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:06,932
防止水上涨的话就好了
keep the water from rising.

708
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,633
是啊 但说起来容易做起来难
Yeah, well, easier said than done.

709
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:10,202
-这需要时间 -换句话说
- This is gonna take time. - So, in other words,

710
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,403
我们现在没辙了
we're screwed right now.

711
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:13,338
全靠你了 Lasalle
Ball's in your court, Lasalle.

712
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,008
自动武器的声音是从那边过来的
Automatic gunfire coming from up there.

713
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,477
行动
Let's move!

714
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,966
NCIS
NCIS!

715
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:54,980
King 你安全了
King! You're good!

716
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,169
NCIS
NCIS!

717
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,203
放下武器
Drop your weapon!

718
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:33,185
我来抓住他
I got him!

719
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:34,085
Lasalle
Lasalle!

720
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:35,086
别开枪
Don't shoot!

721
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:37,522
他手里有引爆器
He's got the detonator!

722
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,635
放下刀
Drop the knife!

723
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:06,117
Percy
Percy.

724
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,385
你还好么
You okay?

725
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:08,820
嗯 没事
Yeah, I'm okay.

726
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,055
真的吗 因为 呃
Really? 'Cause, uh,

727
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,723
你差点被人干掉了
you kinda got your ass kicked.

728
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:14,793
但是我拿到了引爆器啊 你有什么
But I also got the detonator. What'd you get?

729
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,428
Pride在哪里
Where's Pride?

730
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:38,416
知道我不会把你忘了的 是吗
Didn't think I'd forget about you, did you?

731
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:41,319
你还想要什么
What more could you possibly want?!

732
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:45,123
没什么
Nothin'.

733
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:48,960
清水市现在安全了
Clearwater is safe.

734
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,932
你的海军船坞梦结束了
Your dream of a Navy shipyard is finished.

735
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,003
再没有无辜的人会受伤
No more innocent people are gonna get hurt.

736
00:33:58,005 --> 00:34:00,839
现在是时候
Now it's just...

737
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:04,709
好好算账了
time to settle up.

738
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:09,281
怎么 你要杀了我么
So, what, you're gonna kill me?

739
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:14,386
而你会得到 十年狱行
And your reward, ten years in prison

740
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:18,189
原因是袭击和绑架市长
for assaulting and abducting the mayor.

741
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:20,859
如果开枪 就是终身监禁
Life-- you pull that trigger.

742
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:24,629
除非我们做个交易
Unless we make a deal.

743
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:30,969
我觉得不可能
I don't think so.

744
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:34,139
你之前想要
You tried to...

745
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,408
用这把枪杀了我
kill me with this gun.

746
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,209
而这只是你最轻的罪行了
And that's the least of your crimes.

747
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,945
你整个职业生涯
Spent your entire career

748
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:44,249
都用来为了你的个人利益而伤害别人
hurting people for your own personal gain.

749
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:47,152
今天都结束了
And that ends today.

750
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:48,793
请你 听我说 拜托
Just, please, listen to me. Please.

751
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:50,623
我现在杀你也是光明正大
I'd be within my rights to take you out,

752
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:53,758
一枪毙了你
to kill you.

753
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,861
就凭你对我做的这些事
For everything you've done to me,

754
00:34:56,863 --> 00:34:59,798
对我的团队 我的城市
my team, my city.

755
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,499
我们的城市
Our city.

756
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:05,070
因为不管你怎么看我
'Cause no matter what you think of me,

757
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:07,439
我们都热爱新奥尔良
we both love New Orleans!

758
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:12,310
我和Stone还有他的雇员做了交易
Did I make a deal with Stone and his employers

759
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:14,312
要把船坞建在这里
to bring that shipyard here?

760
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:16,881
对 我做了 是我干的
Yes, I did. I did.

761
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:20,719
我是为了这个城市好
For the good of the city!

762
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:26,524
我是犯了错
And mistakes were made!

763
00:35:26,526 --> 00:35:28,927
我很后悔
And I regret that.

764
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:32,097
确实有人死了
And people did die.

765
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:36,568
但这只是因为 我知道我们能成就伟大的事业
But only because I knew that we could do something great!

766
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,237
你没有资格审判我
You have no right to judge me!

767
00:36:01,128 --> 00:36:04,295
我不打算审判你 Douglas
I'm not gonna judge you, Douglas.

768
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:08,600
我会让司法系统来审判你
Gonna let the justice system do that.

769
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:14,939
Douglas Hamilton
Douglas Hamilton,

770
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:17,509
你被捕了
you are under arrest.

771
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:24,416
看看我 看看他对我做了什么
Look at me. Look at me. Look what he did to me.

772
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:27,185
他朝我开枪 他绑架我
He shot me, huh? He abducted me.

773
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,788
他威胁我 我要提出全面诉讼
He threatened me. I'm gonna press full charges.

774
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,356
闭嘴吧 市长先生
Shut up, Mr. Mayor.

775
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,758
这事没完 这事没完
It's not over! It's not over!

776
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,528
副局长
Deputy Director,

777
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,330
我都不知道你来城里了
I didn't realize that you were in town.

778
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:41,633
我想我得谢谢你
I take it I have you to thank

779
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:43,635
让我的团队能继续工作
for getting my team back in the field.

780
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:46,137
远不止这个
And so much more.

781
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,307
-我们欠他一个大人情 -嘿 帮我个忙
- We owe him big-time. - Hey, do me a favor,

782
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:50,642
别再找我帮忙了
don't do me any favors.

783
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:52,844
把我号码删了
Lose my phone number.

784
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:55,280
你怎么找到我的
How'd you track me down?

785
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:56,781
一些测写技巧
A little profiling.

786
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:58,950
想到你会把Hamilton带到一切的源头
Figured you'd take Hamilton to the source,

787
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:03,121
让他面对他所做的一切
make him face everything he's done.

788
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:06,691
作为新人 你很了解我
You know me well, for a newbie.

789
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:08,359
也不是那么了解
Not that well.

790
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:11,963
我当时也不知道你会不会开枪
I was wondering whether you'd pull that trigger.

791
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:16,968
有想过
Crossed my mind.

792
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,704
Stone呢
What about Stone?

793
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:23,174
我需不需要知道屋顶上发生的事情呢
Do I really want to know what went down on that roof?

794
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:26,478
他用了刀子
He had a knife.

795
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,114
是在你把他手铐解开之前还是之后
Was that before or after you took his cuffs off?

796
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:33,384
不管怎样 你得检查下伤口
Either way, you need to get that checked out.

797
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:35,253
我会的
I will.

798
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,655
现在
Right now,

799
00:37:37,657 --> 00:37:40,992
我只是需要坐下
I just need to sit.

800
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:46,464
你刚刚获得了"特等奖"
You just bagged the grand prize.

801
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:48,800
下一步呢
What's next?

802
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:52,036
说实话
Honestly...

803
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:54,839
我不知道
I have no idea.

804
00:38:01,147 --> 00:38:04,516
报道称Isler开展了一次极为机密的卧底行动
Says Isler ran a highly classified undercover operation

805
00:38:04,518 --> 00:38:06,084
以扳倒Hamilton市长
to take down Mayor Hamilton

806
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:09,821
贪污谋杀的阴谋
in a conspiracy of corruption and murder.

807
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:12,156
但没有提到我们
And not one mention of us.

808
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:14,492
没事 因为我们扳倒了市长 拯救了清水市
That's okay. 'Cause we took down the mayor, saved Clearwater,

809
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:15,793
我们团队又能一起工作了
and got our team back.

810
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,729
-让Isler邀功去吧 -哈
- Let Isler have the credit. - Huh?

811
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:20,732
几个月前你还在调查我们 现在看看你
You were investigating us a few months ago, and now look at you.

812
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:21,966
家庭的一员
Part of the family.

813
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:24,302
我非常重视家庭
Well, I take family very serious.

814
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:26,371
我也是 我们得走了
Well, so do I. And we got to get going

815
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,006
如果我们想做这件事的话
if we're gonna get this thing started.

816
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:30,775
Patton和Wade已经在路上了 快点
Patton and Wade are already on their way. Come on.

817
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,044
嘿
Hey.

818
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:35,847
我们能谈一会儿吗
Can we talk for a second?

819
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:37,148
可以
Sure.

820
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,750
嗯 只是...
Yeah, it's just...

821
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:40,418
最近发生了这些疯狂的事情
with all the craziness lately,

822
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,621
我都没机会谢谢你
I never really got the chance to thank you.

823
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:46,591
在我进监狱的时候 你真的为了我拼命
You really put yourself on the line for me when I went to jail,

824
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:48,226
你保证了我的安全
and you kept me safe.

825
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:50,628
你甚至让法官放我出来
You even got the judge to let me out.

826
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,397
你也会为我这么做的
You would've done the same for me.

827
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,365
不 不 不
No, no, no.

828
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:57,936
我想说的是 我很感激
What I want to say is, I appreciate it.

829
00:38:57,938 --> 00:39:01,172
你的支持 我一言难尽
Your support means more than I can say.

830
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:04,909
不管你要做什么 在做之前
You know, before you do whatever it is you're about to do,

831
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:06,911
先听我说完 好吗
