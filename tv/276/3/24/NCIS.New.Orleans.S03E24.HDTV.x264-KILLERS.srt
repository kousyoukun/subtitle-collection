1
00:00:02,116 --> 00:00:03,348
I'm gonna make damn sure

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,550
you spend the rest
of your miserable...

3
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:05,918
Ah!
...corrupt life in prison.

4
00:00:06,184 --> 00:00:07,683
You are finished,
Dwayne.

5
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:08,818
You are done!

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,152
It's my hope to convince you

7
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:11,120
why Clearwater

8
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:12,521
<i>is the best candidate</i>

9
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:13,956
<i>for the first naval shipyards</i>

10
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,858
<i>to be built in our country</i>
<i>in decades.</i>

11
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,493
You want to break ground
next month,

12
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,295
but people are still living
on the very site.

13
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:20,429
It's not even cleared.

14
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,864
<i>Well, I should've</i>
<i>stopped Hamilton</i>

15
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:22,965
a long time ago!

16
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:23,766
He's killed people,

17
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:25,034
and more people are gonna die

18
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:26,735
if I don't do
something right now.

19
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:28,003
Pride.

20
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,572
<i>He needs to be dealt with.</i>

21
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:34,243
It's not Pride.

22
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:36,178
Maybe he wants everyone else
to think he's dead.

23
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,813
Especially Hamilton.

24
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:40,549
Just wanted to make sure

25
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:42,284
you were still
breathin', Mr. Stone.

26
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:55,664
Ah...

27
00:00:57,768 --> 00:01:00,336
Who are you?

28
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:01,737
I'm Mr. Stone.

29
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,405
Yeah.

30
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:05,975
I know that's what you
call yourself,

31
00:01:05,977 --> 00:01:08,611
but I want to know who you are.

32
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:10,212
Does it matter?

33
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:11,447
You tried to kill me.

34
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:12,681
Least you can do
is tell me

35
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:14,383
your real name
before we proceed.

36
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:15,484
If you think
you're gonna scare me

37
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:16,919
into some kind of confession

38
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:18,687
with all of these theatrics,

39
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,357
then by all means,
let's proceed.

40
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,696
Hamilton is
gonna empty

41
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:29,798
Clearwater and build
a Navy shipyard.

42
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,300
And I'm gonna stop him.

43
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,136
Ah!

44
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:36,605
Eliza West.

45
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:39,208
Javier Garcia.

46
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,609
Henry Morgan.

47
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:42,278
Five FBI agents.

48
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:47,316
Oh, you're not going
to scare me.

49
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:48,984
Or shame me.

50
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,853
Even if you could,

51
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:53,022
it wouldn't change anything.

52
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,991
Plan's in motion.

53
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:58,294
You can't stop it now.

54
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:07,303
You know, you got a great
opportunity here, Pride.

55
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:09,315
Everyone thinks you're dead.

56
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:11,117
You got nothing to lose.

57
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,819
I mean, you can be anyone,

58
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,187
do anything.

59
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:21,861
You're right about one thing,
Mr. Stone.

60
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:25,899
I got nothing to lose.

I don't have a clue.

71
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:05,705
I got word from Swanson
to come down here quickly,

72
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:06,839
so I called you.

73
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:09,108
Lasalle, Percy.

74
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,544
Oh, my God.

75
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:16,582
I was just so shocked
to hear about Pride.

76
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:19,485
I mean I... I can't believe it.

77
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:22,121
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, we can't believe it, either.

78
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,756
You have any idea
who did it?

79
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,057
It's complicated.

80
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:26,793
Well, I might be able to help.

81
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:30,429
Victim took a flyer off
a nearby roof, we think.

82
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,699
Been told he's a person of
interest in Dwayne's murder.

83
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:36,636
Well, we appreciate the call,
but our team was suspended.

84
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:38,171
We can't, technically, be here.

85
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:39,438
Technically,
you're not,

86
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,073
otherwise my ass
is on the line,

87
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:43,042
but I was asked
to reach out.

88
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:44,443
Ms. Loretta.

89
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:45,845
This is not a Coast Guard body.

90
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:47,313
Okay? We're baby-sitting.

91
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:48,815
I'd say you've got
about five minutes

92
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:50,716
before the NOPD shows up.

93
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:52,819
Make the most of it.

94
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:54,353
Thank you.

95
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:55,788
What's up with the cloak
and dagger?

96
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,124
You tell me.

97
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:03,129
Stone.

98
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:04,931
Hamilton's right-hand man.

99
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,899
And the suspect
most likely responsible

100
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,568
for trying to kill Pride.

101
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,735
What happened?

102
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:11,737
Ligature marks on the wrists,

103
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,106
contusions, bruising
of the face...

104
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:16,676
He was bound, beaten and
probably tossed off a roof.

105
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:19,278
So, not suicide.

106
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,414
No, but I found
some evidence that--

107
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,950
I don't know what
to make of it.

108
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:25,751
Right here.

109
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:27,486
A fingerprint.

110
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:31,624
It's Dwayne's.

111
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,030
Does Swanson know?

112
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:39,432
Only the three of us.

113
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:41,334
Good.
Let's keep it that way.

114
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:43,636
Well, look, you guys. There has
to be a good explanation for this.

115
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:47,807
Pride's been pushed
to the limit, Percy, all right?

116
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:50,743
Going after Hamilton's cost him
his job, his team.

117
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:52,011
It's a lot of bodies.

118
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:53,946
And you weren't saying this
a few days ago, Lasalle.

119
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:55,615
In fact, you were
saying the opposite.

120
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:57,283
Yeah, well,
that was before Pride

121
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,218
decided to play dead
and disappear.

122
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,853
He had his reasons.

123
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:02,321
You know that.

124
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:03,956
Look, I don't want to jump
to conclusions.

125
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:08,661
I still have to get the body
back to autopsy, but...

126
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:11,197
I wanted you
to bear witness.

127
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,965
Because whatever Pride did here,

128
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,433
no one else needs
to know about it

129
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:17,436
until you find him.

130
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,816
I've never seen so many
condolence gifts in my life.

131
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:32,451
The entire
kitchen's filled up.

132
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:34,487
Half the restaurants in
New Orleans sent a platter.

133
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:36,322
Yeah. King's loved
in this city.

134
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:38,524
Well, I told Roy
to take some of the food home.

135
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:40,226
He's pretty broken up, too.

136
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:42,128
I just hate having to
pretend that Pride's dead.

137
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,597
Yeah, well, if we want to keep
him alive and find him,

138
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:46,532
that's what we're all gonna have
to keep doing.

139
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,834
Well, uh, how exactly are we
supposed to find him, though?

140
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:50,536
I mean, we don't have
any badges, no resources.

141
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,872
In fact, none of you should
be here in the first place.

142
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,540
What the hell is he doing here?

143
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,609
I asked him to come.
Pride's off the reservation.

144
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:58,411
Hamilton's declared war.
We're all gonna lose our jobs,

145
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:00,012
or better yet,
we're gonna be reassigned

146
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:01,914
to some backwater.
We need help.

147
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,282
So you called the
FBI agent that tried

148
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:04,717
to break us apart
in the first place?

149
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,319
Seems you've been able
to accomplish that feat

150
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,920
all on your own.
Look, you're right.

151
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:09,455
Isler's a pain in the ass.
Hey.

152
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:11,190
What? He's ambitious
and a rule-follower,

153
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:12,658
but you know what?
He's incorruptible,

154
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,961
and a man of his word,
and we can trust him.

155
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:16,629
Thanks, I think.

156
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:18,130
He's our only hope
at finding Pride,

157
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:20,333
stopping Hamilton
and saving Clearwater.

158
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:23,069
I hate it,

159
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:25,137
but it kind of makes sense.

160
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:29,475
Well, thank you for your
generosity of spirit.

161
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:33,112
Now, Gregorio downloaded
me on the case.

162
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:34,647
I've got it from here.

163
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,482
I will find Pride.

164
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:38,784
- You can all go home now.
- W-Wait. What? No way.

165
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:40,987
Yeah, we're not sitting
on the sidelines.

166
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:43,356
That's precisely what you'll do
and it's non-negotiable.

167
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:45,491
All right, let's chat.

168
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:49,762
I agreed to take the reigns
and fix what your team broke.

169
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:52,098
I did not agree to allow you
to go rogue along with Pride.

170
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,401
No. You're 100% right;
we should not go rogue.

171
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,937
But you need to get
our badges back.

172
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,739
Your own Deputy Director
suspended you.

173
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:01,407
How am I supposed
to change that?

174
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:02,575
'Cause you got pull.

175
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:04,577
Yes. I do.

176
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:06,512
But I'm not about to waste
it for a former agent

177
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:08,347
who decided to give up her career,
Ah.

178
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,049
and run away to the circus.

179
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:13,019
Are you kidding me? You're still
mad that I came to NCIS?

180
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:15,421
I spent my life trying
to figure out where I fit in,

181
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:17,289
and it was not FBI,
it was here.

182
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,325
And I'm not about to let
that disappear because of...

183
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:20,793
That's really beautiful,
Gregorio,

184
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,228
but it doesn't change
a damn thing.

185
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,796
I'm not finished, Raymond.

186
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:25,698
If Dwayne Pride doesn't want
to be found,

187
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,333
he's not gonna be found.
I don't care how many agents

188
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:29,502
you have on the case.

189
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:31,504
You're saying that I need you.

190
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:34,974
No... Okay.

191
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:37,009
What I'm saying is,

192
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:40,179
if you really want to finish
what you started here,

193
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:44,383
who better to find him than
the team he personally trained?

194
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,088
All right.

195
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,524
I'll make some calls
and get your badges back.

196
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,092
Now, the case, where are
we with finding Pride?

197
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:54,527
We know he was with Stone
last night,

198
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:55,694
Hamilton's right-hand man.

199
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:57,530
Who he threw off a roof.

200
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:59,331
We are not sure about that.

201
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,300
We couldn't find
Stone's cell phone.

202
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:02,902
Pride probably has it.

203
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:04,570
All right, well, I'll work
on tracking the phone.

204
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:06,672
Hoping he's on the same network
as the other operatives.

205
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:08,307
All right, Stone's body
is in autopsy.

206
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:09,675
Since we've been reinstated,

207
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:11,243
Percy and I will
go talk to Wade.

208
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:13,012
See if she's got
any more evidence.

209
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:14,647
How about you?

210
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,382
Any clue as to where
your boss may be headed?

211
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:19,218
Nope.

212
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,287
But I know who he's after.

213
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,123
You cannot go inside.

214
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,858
The mayor's in a locked-door
meeting all morning.

215
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,693
No, sorry, ma'am.
We need to talk to him now.

216
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:28,928
This can't wait.

217
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,029
It's gonna have to.

218
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,697
And you...
you need to leave.

219
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:33,099
Who the hell are you?

220
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:35,534
Captain Estes, NOPD.

221
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:37,136
I'm takin' over the
mayor's protection detail.

222
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:38,237
Okay. Well, I'm
Special Agent Gregorio

223
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:39,438
and I need to get in there.

224
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,806
Yeah, I know exactly
who you are.

225
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,108
We believe the
mayor's in danger.

226
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,442
Yeah, from people like her.

227
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:44,743
Shoot-out in
the French Quarter,

228
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,011
car running into
a crowded restaurant,

229
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:49,315
all courtesy of
Dwayne Pride and NCIS.

230
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:52,084
Whoa. He's no longer with us,
okay? Have a little respect.

231
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:54,253
- Yeah? Well, he's not the only one.
- Yeah.

232
00:08:54,255 --> 00:08:55,721
I just found out that the
mayor's private security

233
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:57,256
consultant was found dead
last night.

234
00:08:57,258 --> 00:08:59,024
As well as
Congresswoman Angelou.

235
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:01,193
Chairwoman of the
Armed Services Committee?

236
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:02,862
Had some kind of stroke
at the airport, so no one

237
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:05,364
is getting inside,
especially NCIS, so let's go.

238
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,665
No, I'm--
Get off.

239
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:07,967
I'm not NCIS.

240
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:09,235
I'm FBI Deputy Director Isler.

241
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,569
Now, let me explain
the situation.

242
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:11,670
Screw this.

243
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:12,738
H-hey! Stop!

244
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,974
Stop!

245
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:16,575
He's not here.

246
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,844
He came in at 7:00, never left.

247
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:20,880
We have a code red,
the mayor is missing.

248
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:22,815
I need all units
to search the building.

249
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:25,117
What's this?
Navy shipyard

250
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,652
the mayor wants to build
in Clearwater.

251
00:09:26,654 --> 00:09:28,888
The reason so many people
have died.

252
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,290
Including, it seems,
the congresswoman.

253
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:33,893
Yeah, and if we don't act fast,
a lot of others could get hurt.

254
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:36,595
The entire neighborhood of
Clearwater is getting razed.

255
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:39,398
The mayor's not in the building
and his car is missing.

256
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
We're gonna activate
the GPS now.

257
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:44,637
I'm gonna need to talk to
both of you after we find him.

258
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:56,382
Stone.

259
00:09:58,186 --> 00:10:00,019
Stone!

260
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:01,887
Where the hell are you, man?

261
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:03,556
I got a schedule to keep.
Stone, where you at?!

262
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:13,632
Douglas... really?

263
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:16,368
Dammit. Dwayne, you shot me.

264
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,670
You shot yourself.

265
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:19,672
You're supposed to be dead.

266
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:21,740
And you're gonna end up that way
unless you do as I say.

267
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:23,375
Get in the car.

268
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,645
Gregorio and Isler are
being interviewed by NOPD,

269
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,113
but they sent photos
from the scene

270
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:40,214
where Hamilton was abducted.

271
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:42,383
Shell casings, blood.

272
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:43,784
Who got shot?
Hamilton.

273
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:45,152
Whoa.

274
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:47,054
I mean, at least, according to
NOPD crime scene techs,

275
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:49,356
but I, I can't believe
that Pride did it.

276
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,891
We couldn't believe he threw
that guy off the roof, either.

277
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,860
Hey, we don't know
that he did that.

278
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:55,629
You were just with me
at autopsy, Percy.

279
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:56,897
Doc Wade said

280
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,066
that Stone was forcibly
thrown off that roof.

281
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:00,201
Wait, what?

282
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:01,635
What is it with you, Lasalle?

283
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:03,237
You've known that man
for over ten years.

284
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,272
You always have his back,
and now all of a sudden

285
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:06,474
you think he's
gone off the rails?

286
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:07,808
Yeah, I don't want to.

287
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,044
But if Pride's got
a breaking point,

288
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:11,345
it's Hamilton.

289
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:13,280
So let's find him.

290
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:15,416
Look, uh, Wade...

291
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:18,452
got this foreign substance
off of Stone's clothes.

292
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:20,421
Can you analyze it?
Yeah, will do.

293
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:23,190
But, uh, look, I want to show
you guys something first.

294
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:25,659
It's the tire treads from
the Hamilton crime scene.

295
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:28,295
This could be the car
that Pride took him in.

296
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:29,830
Can you get us details?

297
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,599
Yeah, Firestone,
deep traction.

298
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,767
Probably from a late model
American sedan.

299
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:36,470
I'm thinking
a silver Chrysler 300.

300
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:39,139
So you got the color of the car
off of some tire tracks?

301
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:40,241
Well, I did
when I cross-referenced

302
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:41,775
the tire treads
to surveillance

303
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:43,444
that was taken
about a block away

304
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:44,879
from Pride's bar
after it exploded.

305
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:47,481
I'm guessing that
this was Stone's car,

306
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:49,917
and then Pride took it.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

307
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,453
The man is under FBI
investigation for a hot minute,

308
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,688
and look how he's treated.
I was gonna mention you.

309
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,856
Mm-hmm.
I'm glad you're back, P.

310
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:56,991
And better than ever, baby.

311
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:58,192
Hasn't been the same
without you.

312
00:11:58,194 --> 00:12:00,961
Of course not.
But back to business.

313
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:03,297
I accessed the city's surveillance cameras
for this footage.

314
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,766
And can you find more?
I'm working on it--

315
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,468
but that's a lot
of city miles to cover.

316
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,469
Boss man could be anywhere.

317
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:10,004
Not just anywhere.

318
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:12,640
Look, we all know Pride
inside and out.

319
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:15,943
And I don't care how obsessed he
is with bringing Hamilton down,

320
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,846
if that man is hurt,
he's gonna try to fix him.

321
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:22,550
Yeah, especially if he's got
information he wants.

322
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:30,491
I need a hospital,
not a Band-Aid.

323
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:32,092
I know you're pissed,

324
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:34,361
but I never meant to
draw that gun on you.

325
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:35,696
You sent Stone to kill me.

326
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:37,598
Is that what he said?
He's a liar.

327
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,533
Stone's dead.

328
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:41,969
Add him to the list
of people who've paid

329
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,771
for your Clearwater plan.

330
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:47,074
I don't have a plan.

331
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:48,943
I don't have a plan.

332
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:53,581
I am revitalizing...

333
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,549
a blighted neighborhood.

334
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,651
By razing the area
for a shipyard!

335
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,354
I literally have no idea
what you're talking about.

336
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:05,125
Hello.

337
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:06,794
Stone, it's Johan.
Team's in place.

338
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:08,696
Operation's a go.
Three-hour countdown.

339
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,564
Final confirmation.

340
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:16,470
Confirmation denied.

341
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:19,106
You're not Stone.

342
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:22,977
Who's Johan?

343
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:25,646
Huh? What's the operation?
Dwayne. You know, Dwayne...

344
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:26,981
Hey.
Dwayne...

345
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:29,016
You're gonna tell me.
Dwayne,

346
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:31,196
I'm gonna bleed to death
unless you get me to a doctor.

347
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,753
No, no, no.

348
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,253
Not just yet.

349
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,459
Hello?

350
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:39,259
Loretta...

351
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:40,561
Dw... Hey.

352
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:41,662
What's going on?

353
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:43,130
Are you alone?

354
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:44,398
No.

355
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
The police are everywhere.

356
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:47,968
Did you kidnap the mayor?

357
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,902
No, I wouldn't call it
kidnapping.

358
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:50,838
Yeah, I would.
Okay, listen.

359
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,473
You can't let anybody know
that we're talking.

360
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:53,474
Is Hamilton okay?

361
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:55,242
Hamilton is <i>not</i> okay.

362
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:56,677
He's got a bullet
in his upper arm.

363
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,245
He's bleeding fast,
even with pressure.

364
00:13:58,247 --> 00:13:59,647
He needs a doctor.

365
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:00,948
No, that's why I called you.

366
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,750
To help me remove the bullet.

367
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:04,618
Where are you? I'll come.

368
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,920
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

369
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:09,757
Dwayne, what are you doing?
I'm finishing what I started.

370
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,260
Requires Hamilton to survive
a little longer.

371
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:14,662
Now, tell me what to do.

372
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:16,130
Okay, uh...

373
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:18,499
you need to put pressure
on the brachial artery.

374
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,967
It's just below the armpit.

375
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:21,969
Should help with hemostasis.

376
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:26,340
Yeah, it's working.

377
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:27,941
Now you need to tie off the arm.

378
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:30,110
Tight enough
to stop circulation flow.

379
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:33,614
Which could cause further trauma
if he doesn't see a doctor.

380
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:42,256
What are you doing?

381
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:43,290
Loretta...

382
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,491
What are
you doing?

383
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:45,893
Loretta, you tell anybody
I was on the phone?

384
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:47,061
Absolutely not.

385
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:49,229
Stop. Oh...

386
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:54,435
You've got a tracking device?

387
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:56,637
Of course I've got
a tracking device.

388
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,740
I got maniacs like you
following me, don't I?

389
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:01,875
Loretta, tell the others...

390
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:05,012
Stone has another team
in play in Clearwater.

391
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:07,014
Something's happening
in the next three hours.

392
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:09,249
Dwayne, wait. Dway... Dwayne!

393
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:12,352
Move! Move!
You go right!

394
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,489
Clear!

395
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:16,757
Clear!

396
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:32,649
We got problems.

397
00:15:32,651 --> 00:15:35,505
NOPD used a GPS chip
hidden on the mayor

398
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:36,959
to track him
to a shuttered medical clinic.

399
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,493
He was gone,
along with Pride.

400
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,095
Need to know
where they are now.

401
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:41,796
Patton searched
surveillance cameras.

402
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:44,699
Stone's car was driving
away from the clinic.

403
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,935
Then it went off the grid.

404
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,203
I assure you

405
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:49,804
we're not the only ones
with that image.

406
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:51,673
It's only a matter of time
before NOPD

407
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:53,375
figures out that Pride's alive
and has Hamilton.

408
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:55,210
Yeah, he'll be harder to find
now that he knows

409
00:15:55,212 --> 00:15:57,011
- he's being tracked.
- The answer's simple.

410
00:15:57,013 --> 00:16:00,682
We contact Captain Estes at NOPD
and tell him everything.

411
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:03,118
Uh-uh, we do that, they'll assume Pride
kidnapped the mayor.

412
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,019
He'll be public enemy
number one.

413
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,855
He <i>did</i> kidnap the mayor.

414
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:08,890
Look, you're under
the impression that Pride

415
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:10,458
went off the reservation
on some holy mission

416
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,828
to save the city--
perhaps he just went off.

417
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,531
He told Wade that there were
more operatives in Clearwater.

418
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,967
He's still trying
to save the neighborhood.

419
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:20,435
Problem is, we're no closer
to figuring out

420
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,404
Hamilton's plan
to empty Clearwater.

421
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,205
Actually, we're a lot closer.

422
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:26,775
I just analyzed the trace found
on Stone's clothing.

423
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,643
It's TATB explosives.

424
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:30,845
It's highly insensitive, which
means it's easy to transport,

425
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:32,514
and it's... very powerful.

426
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:35,083
Stone blew up Pride's bar.
Not with that.

427
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:36,885
That's used to
detonate warheads.

428
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:39,287
- Stone's operatives have another plan.
- Yeah, well,

429
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,222
they're taking something out--
something big enough

430
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:42,411
to drive the residents
out of Clearwater for good.

431
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,659
Yeah, Clearwater

432
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,260
is big-- there's no way we find

433
00:16:45,262 --> 00:16:46,661
those explosives on our own.

434
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:48,663
Then we loop in Captain Estes.
No.

435
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:49,998
NOPD can't be trusted.

436
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,966
But I know
someone who can.

437
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:54,969
That's Estes.

438
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,171
I'm done with this charade.

439
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,808
Captain Estes, we need to talk
about Mayor Hamilton.

440
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,042
Isler, wait.
I'm sorry,

441
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:02,644
somebody just walked
into my office.

442
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,312
Just hear me out. Please.

443
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,681
I'm sorry, I'll
call you right back.

444
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:08,616
Pride's out there
trying to get answers

445
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:09,884
from Hamilton.

446
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:11,386
If you really want
to sort this out,

447
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,188
you need to give us more time.

448
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,456
By abetting kidnapping?

449
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,824
Won't just be <i>your</i> ass
on the line,

450
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,225
target'll be on my back, too.
All right,

451
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:18,526
let's just be honest--
target's been

452
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:20,061
on your back since you got here.

453
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:21,629
I know why you wanted me here.

454
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:22,931
No.
You wanted your badges back,

455
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:24,065
and you wanted me to step aside,

456
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:24,999
but that's not how I work.

457
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,968
I'm calling Estes.
The minute you

458
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,703
tell them Pride's alive,
it'll be full-court press.

459
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:31,272
NOPD doesn't give a crap
about saving Clearwater.

460
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:34,175
You will undercut everything
Pride's fought for.

461
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:36,945
Come on.

462
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:38,913
Help me help Pride.

463
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:40,448
Please.

464
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:43,051
I'll give you two hours

465
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,986
to figure out
where those explosives are.

466
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:48,323
Okay. All right, thanks.

467
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:54,095
<i>Dwayne.</i>

468
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,364
<i>Dwayne, we got to stop.</i>

469
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,866
I need help.

470
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:03,771
Clearwater Baptist, huh?

471
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:06,007
What is this,
another metaphor for...

472
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:08,276
my "come to Jesus" moment?

473
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:11,179
You're way past repenting.

474
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:13,548
And you're way out of options.

475
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,316
Who's Johan?

476
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:17,485
What is the plan?

477
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:18,720
Or what?

478
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,788
You're not gonna kill me.

479
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,891
Stone said the same thing,

480
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,927
and look what happened to him.

481
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:29,137
Well, he deserved
whatever you did to him.

482
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:30,199
You gonna tell me

483
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,500
that Stone's responsible
for all this?

484
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:35,803
Using drug money
to buy property in Clearwater,

485
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:38,239
the personal attacks on
my team-- Stone's responsible?

486
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,208
Taking advantage

487
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,776
of my desire to help

488
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:43,811
a struggling area
of this city.

489
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,247
Bringing in
thousands of jobs.

490
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:48,449
And the only thing I'm
guilty of is caring

491
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:49,751
about this city <i>too</i> much.

492
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,054
Even you
are not that good a liar.

493
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:55,089
Then why don't
you come in?

494
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:56,824
Come on in, then!

495
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:59,561
And you tell your version
and I'll tell mine!

496
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:01,663
And who do you think
they're gonna believe?

497
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:04,432
Some... fugitive federal agent

498
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,335
or the respected mayor
of New Orleans?

499
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:10,004
You got no moves left here.

500
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:11,673
I got one.

501
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:13,641
I wasn't expecting
an epiphany.

502
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:16,077
Just betting
on the only motive

503
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,346
that's ever mattered to you.

504
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:20,448
Self-preservation.

505
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,450
What are you doing?

506
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,086
I didn't bring you here
as a metaphor to Clearwater.

507
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:26,888
This is ground zero.

508
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,725
Whatever's
about to happen here...

509
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:33,394
will happen to you, too.

510
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:38,566
Pride is alive?

511
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,336
You got to be kidding me.

512
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:42,704
I sent flowers.

513
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:44,539
Yeah, it was
a very tasteful arrangement.

514
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,641
And you can have them back
if you want.

515
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,076
Uh, no. I...

516
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:50,845
We would have told you
this morning if we could.

517
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,981
Is this some kind of
undercover operation?

518
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,217
Uh, sort of, yeah.
It's-it's a little complicated.

519
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:59,253
Listen, the more we tell you,
the more compromised you'll be.

520
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:01,322
The situation's
not exactly kosher.

521
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:02,957
Well, give me
the Reader's Digest.

522
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,627
Okay. Well,
we think Mayor Hamilton

523
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:07,095
has a team of operatives

524
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:09,430
planting an explosive device
in Clearwater.

525
00:20:09,432 --> 00:20:12,066
Yeah, and I've been working on
a list of potential targets.

526
00:20:12,068 --> 00:20:15,837
There is a chemical plant,
sewage treatment facility,

527
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,372
electrical grid station,

528
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:19,507
or it could be
a population center,

529
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,109
like a grocery store
or a school.

530
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:23,144
In other words,
we don't know jack.

531
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:26,414
Which is why I'm here--
you need Coast Guard tech.

532
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,050
You've got that FLIR camera
that can detect heat signatures.

533
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,052
Yeah, but it's got to be
hush-hush.

534
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:32,820
Because it's not exactly kosher.

535
00:20:32,822 --> 00:20:34,856
And we got to move fast.

536
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,492
Well, I'll get the bird in
the air and boots on the ground.

537
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:40,395
You coming?
Yeah, I'll go.

538
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:42,397
Listen, I'm gonna stick around.

539
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:44,632
Try and locate Pride
and Hamilton before anyone else.

540
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,134
You got it.

541
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,517
<i>CGIS and NCIS ground, 6592,</i>

542
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,986
<i>overhead Clearwater, beginning</i>
<i>Sierra Sierra search pattern.</i>

543
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:08,189
<i>Copy that. We are in transit.</i>

544
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:12,460
Wait a minute.

545
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:14,262
<i>The FLIR camera's picking up</i>
<i>an abnormal heat signature</i>

546
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:15,763
<i>It's from a power</i>
<i>and water truck</i>

547
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,832
parked off Adelaide and Fulton.

548
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:20,001
We're on it.

549
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:25,406
NCIS!

550
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:35,683
We got a runner!

551
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,088
NCIS! Stop!

552
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,533
We got a body.

553
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:54,068
Some kind of security guard.

554
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:57,205
Explosives.

555
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,674
But I'm guessing there was
a lot more back here.

556
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:01,008
Guys, we got another problem.

557
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,244
That suspect just
sent out a Stuxnet worm.

558
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:06,447
None of us knows
what that is.

559
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:07,815
I-It's a malicious virus.

560
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:09,450
It infects programmable
logic controllers.

561
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:11,786
Uh, overrides
mechanical processes.

562
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,154
It was specifically designed

563
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:14,589
to take out
industrial computer systems.

564
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,290
All right, what's it targeting?

565
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:19,660
They just infected
the Industrial Canal.

566
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:34,041
<i>CG 6592, we have a visual</i>
<i>on the south lock.</i>

567
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:37,178
<i>Gates are opening.</i>
<i>Water's rushing into the canal.</i>

568
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:48,356
Dwayne.

569
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:50,158
Dwayne, you hear that, right?

570
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,360
Flood warning sirens.

571
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:54,562
Don't change the subject.

572
00:22:54,564 --> 00:22:57,031
Need to start talking.

573
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,833
But, uh...

574
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,368
we should leave.

575
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,037
Those sirens go off
twice a week in the spring.

576
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,806
Usually a drill.

577
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:06,207
Uh...

578
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:08,442
better safe than sorry,
though, right?

579
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,647
You nervous?

580
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,284
Nervous?
Well, I'm bleeding to death,

581
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:18,186
being held hostage
by a rogue federal agent, so...

582
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,787
And yet this is

583
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:22,790
the first time I've actually
seen you scared.

584
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,364
You're not gonna
push these people out.

585
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:33,434
You're gonna wash 'em out.

586
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:35,436
You're flooding Clearwater.

587
00:23:35,438 --> 00:23:37,338
That's-that's...
ridiculous.

588
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,806
Devastate the area.

589
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,007
Relocate the residents.

590
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,442
Build your shipyard.

591
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:43,044
Look, if I say yes,

592
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,745
will you uncuff me?

593
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:46,714
You found a way

594
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,884
to make the river rise.
And yet

595
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,220
that's not enough.

596
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,525
After Katrina, they
strengthened the floodgates.

597
00:23:57,527 --> 00:24:01,295
Few extra feet of
water wouldn't...

598
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:04,298
Dwayne, seriously...

599
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,234
we got to go!

600
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,905
You're taking out
the floodgates.

601
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,548
Where you going?

602
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,384
I'm gonna stop what you started
once and for all.

603
00:24:23,386 --> 00:24:25,887
But if we get flooded here

604
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:28,356
I'll be under
nine feet of water!

605
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:32,426
Better hope I save the day.

606
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:45,439
Ah... aah!

607
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,659
Stone's operatives were able to
hack into city infrastructure.

608
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,728
Disable the lock systems across
the whole Industrial Canal.

609
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,996
That means water's
flowing freely

610
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,631
from the river
to Lake Pontchartrain.

611
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,899
Yeah, if one of those levees
breaches, then the water

612
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,502
would change course and
start flooding Clearwater.

613
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,970
That's what the explosives
are for:

614
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,772
to take out a levee,
then take out Clearwater.

615
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:09,790
Can you reverse the hack?

616
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:10,968
I mean, maybe with
Patton's help.

617
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:11,698
Get to it.

618
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:13,044
And based on the evidence
in the truck

619
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,945
there are more
suspects with explosives.

620
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,581
And the body of a security guard
who works riverside access.

621
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,883
Suspects are somewhere
on the water. Probably rigging

622
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:20,984
a levee.
But which one?

623
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,319
We have patrols

624
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,187
sweeping the waterways.
It's a lot of miles to cover.

625
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,823
And there's no guarantee we find
the right levee before it blows.

626
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,092
Evacuating Clearwater just in
case, but it's gonna be tough.

627
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,694
We have to go house
to house to make sure

628
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,762
that people leave,
and we have no manpower here.

629
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,231
I'll get you
those reinforcements.

630
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,732
Find me those suspects.

631
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,168
King was part
of river rescue

632
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,536
for the first week
of Katrina.

633
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,471
Investigated levee
breaches afterward.

634
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,807
He has to have an idea which
levee's most vulnerable.

635
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,040
Oh, so you don't think
he's gone crazy anymore?

636
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,844
I never thought
he was crazy, Percy.

637
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,779
He has every right
to take Hamilton out.

638
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,182
I just hope he chooses
not to cross the line.

639
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,150
Let's head to the river and
see if we can't retrace

640
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,119
the truck's movements.

641
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,043
Oh, damn it.

642
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,579
Dispatch, this is unit 49.

643
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,848
<i>I've got a visual</i>
<i>on a late-model sedan wanted</i>

644
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,683
in connection with
the mayor's abduction.

645
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,653
<i>10-4, 49. Any</i>
<i>available 6th district unit,</i>

646
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,921
<i>49 has a vehicle</i>
<i>matching the descript</i>

647
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,556
<i>of the mayor's abductors</i>

648
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,824
in the 2500 block of Felicity,

649
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,060
turning onto Terpsichore.

650
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,864
That's got to be Pride.

651
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,900
NOPD just spotted him coming out
of Clearwater a minute ago.

652
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,468
No sign of the mayor.

653
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,704
How'd you get this feed?

654
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,673
Never mind. Don't answer.

655
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,875
The bigger issue
is NOPD's onto Pride.

656
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,344
And they're bringing in
the cavalry as we speak.

657
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,896
Driver, turn off the ignition.

658
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,032
Hands out the window.

659
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,902
You're surrounded.

660
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,072
Comply with our
instructions

661
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,708
or we will shoot.

662
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,311
What the hell is he doing?
He's heading to the river.

663
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,081
He must know about the levees.
That's a reach, Gregorio.

664
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,816
He's desperate.
We need to help him.

665
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,417
Seriously.
If we don't do something,

666
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,386
we're gonna watch him die
on that street.

667
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,189
Isler.
I know, Gregorio.

668
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,657
I know.

669
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,726
Let me think.

670
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,071
He's reaching for something.

671
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,940
I've got a clean shot.

672
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,808
Standing by for your go.

673
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,087
Hold this.

674
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,455
Who am I speaking with?

675
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,691
This is Deputy Director Isler.

676
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,594
You need to listen
very carefully to me.

677
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,897
If you and your men
don't stand down this moment,

678
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,900
all of our careers
will be over by tonight.

679
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,302
Dwayne Pride is in that car

680
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,839
and he's working
undercover for me.

681
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,321
All right.
We're standing down.

682
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,312
Thank you.

683
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,114
I truly hope we got this right.

684
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,717
I just got a text.

685
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,319
So did I.
It's from an unknown number.

686
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,854
All it says is
"Florida Street Levee."

687
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,289
Yeah, that's Pride.

688
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,324
It must be what the
operatives are sabotaging.

689
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,194
We need to call
Lasalle and Sonja now.

690
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:38,071
We've been exposed!

691
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:40,338
Set the
detonator now!

692
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:53,752
We're on Florida Street.

693
00:30:53,754 --> 00:30:56,188
We found Stone's car,
but no sign of Pride.

694
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,422
He's got to be somewhere there,

695
00:30:57,424 --> 00:30:59,291
along with the rest
of Stone's men.

696
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:01,026
Yeah, we're gonna sweep the area.
All right, well, you better

697
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,327
hurry up,
because those explosives

698
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,728
could go off at any moment.

699
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,497
It would help if you could
close the locks,

700
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:06,932
keep the water from rising.

701
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,633
Yeah, well,
easier said than done.

702
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:10,202
This is gonna take time.
So, in other words,

703
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,403
we're screwed right now.

704
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:13,338
Ball's in your court, Lasalle.

705
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,008
Automatic gunfire
coming from up there.

706
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,477
Let's move!

707
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,966
NCIS!

708
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:54,980
King! You're good!

709
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,169
NCIS!

710
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,203
Drop your weapon!

711
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:33,185
I got him!

712
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:34,085
Lasalle!

713
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:35,086
Don't shoot!

714
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:37,522
He's got the detonator!

715
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,635
Drop the knife!

716
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:06,117
Percy.

717
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,385
You okay?

718
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:08,820
Yeah, I'm okay.

719
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,055
Really? 'Cause, uh,

720
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,723
you kinda got your ass kicked.

721
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:14,793
But I also got the detonator.
What'd you get?

722
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,428
Where's Pride?

723
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:38,416
Didn't think I'd forget
about you, did you?

724
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:41,319
What more
could you possibly want?!

725
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:45,123
Nothin'.

726
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:48,960
Clearwater is safe.

727
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,932
Your dream
of a Navy shipyard is finished.

728
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,003
No more innocent people
are gonna get hurt.

729
00:33:58,005 --> 00:34:00,839
Now it's just...

730
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:04,709
time to settle up.

731
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:09,281
So, what,
you're gonna kill me?

732
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:14,386
And your reward,
ten years in prison

733
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:18,189
for assaulting
and abducting the mayor.

734
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:20,859
Life-- you pull
that trigger.

735
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:24,629
Unless we make a deal.

736
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:30,969
I don't think so.

737
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:34,139
You tried to...

738
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,408
kill me with this gun.

739
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,209
And that's the least
of your crimes.

740
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,945
Spent your entire career

741
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:44,249
hurting people
for your own personal gain.

742
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:47,152
And that ends today.

743
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:48,793
Just, please, listen to me.
Please.

744
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:50,623
I'd be within my rights
to take you out,

745
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:53,758
to kill you.

746
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,861
For everything
you've done to me,

747
00:34:56,863 --> 00:34:59,798
my team, my city.

748
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,499
Our city.

749
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:05,070
'Cause no matter
what you think of me,

750
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:07,439
we both love New Orleans!

751
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:12,310
Did I make a deal with Stone
and his employers

752
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:14,312
to bring that shipyard here?

753
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:16,881
Yes, I did. I did.

754
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:20,719
For the good of the city!

755
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:26,524
And mistakes were made!

756
00:35:26,526 --> 00:35:28,927
And I regret that.

757
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:32,097
And people did die.

758
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:36,568
But only because I knew that
we could do something great!

759
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,237
You have no right to judge me!

760
00:36:01,128 --> 00:36:04,295
I'm not gonna judge you,
Douglas.

761
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:08,600
Gonna let
the justice system do that.

762
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:14,939
Douglas Hamilton,

763
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:17,509
you are under arrest.

764
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:24,416
Look at me. Look at me.
Look what he did to me.

765
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:27,185
He shot me, huh? He abducted me.

766
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,788
He threatened me.
I'm gonna press full charges.

767
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,356
Shut up, Mr. Mayor.

768
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,758
It's not over! It's not over!

769
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,528
Deputy Director,

770
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,330
I didn't realize
that you were in town.

771
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:41,633
I take it I have you to thank

772
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:43,635
for getting my team back
in the field.

773
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:46,137
And so much more.

774
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,307
We owe him big-time.
Hey, do me a favor,

775
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:50,642
don't do me any favors.

776
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:52,844
Lose my phone number.

777
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:55,280
How'd you track me down?

778
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:56,781
A little profiling.

779
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:58,950
Figured you'd take
Hamilton to the source,

780
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:03,121
make him face
everything he's done.

781
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:06,691
You know me well,
for a newbie.

782
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:08,359
Not that well.

783
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:11,963
I was wondering whether
you'd pull that trigger.

784
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:16,968
Crossed my mind.

785
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,704
What about Stone?

786
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:23,174
Do I really want to know
what went down on that roof?

787
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:26,478
He had a knife.

788
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,114
Was that before or after
you took his cuffs off?

789
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:33,384
Either way, you need
to get that checked out.

790
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:35,253
I will.

791
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,655
Right now,

792
00:37:37,657 --> 00:37:40,992
I just need to sit.

793
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:46,464
You just bagged
the grand prize.

794
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:48,800
What's next?

795
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:52,036
Honestly...

796
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:54,839
I have no idea.

797
00:38:01,147 --> 00:38:04,516
Says Isler ran a highly
classified undercover operation

798
00:38:04,518 --> 00:38:06,084
to take down
Mayor Hamilton

799
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:09,821
in a conspiracy of
corruption and murder.

800
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:12,156
And not one
mention of us.

801
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:14,492
That's okay. 'Cause we took down
the mayor, saved Clearwater,

802
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:15,793
and got our team back.

803
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,729
- Let Isler have the credit.
- Huh?

804
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:20,732
You were investigating us a few
months ago, and now look at you.

805
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:21,966
Part of the family.

806
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:24,302
Well, I take family
very serious.

807
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:26,371
Well, so do I.
And we got to get going

808
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,006
if we're gonna get
this thing started.

809
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:30,775
Patton and Wade are
already on their way. Come on.

810
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,044
Hey.

811
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:35,847
Can we talk for a second?

812
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:37,148
Sure.

813
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,750
Yeah, it's just...

814
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:40,418
with all the craziness lately,

815
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,621
I never really got
the chance to thank you.

816
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:46,591
You really put yourself on the
line for me when I went to jail,

817
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:48,226
and you kept me safe.

818
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:50,628
You even got the judge
to let me out.

819
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,397
You would've done
the same for me.

820
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,365
No, no, no.

821
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:57,936
What I want to say is,
I appreciate it.

822
00:38:57,938 --> 00:39:01,172
Your support means
more than I can say.

823
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:04,909
You know, before you do whatever
it is you're about to do,

824
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:06,911
just hear me out,
all right?

825
00:39:06,913 --> 00:39:08,246
This thing
between us...

826
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:11,215
Ooh, who says that
there's a thing?

827
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:14,085
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's nothin', but...

828
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:17,288
Yeah, it can't
really happen.

829
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:21,659
We just barely kept the team
from falling apart.

830
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:23,561
Yeah, I mean, we don't
need our personal stuff

831
00:39:23,563 --> 00:39:25,663
getting in the way of that.
Yeah, we're a family.

832
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:27,932
All right? We need
to protect that.

833
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:29,267
For the good
of the team.

834
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,668
