00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:24,336
Hey, what the hell?

5
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:25,771
You could've killed me!

6
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:26,872
What are you doing?!

7
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:28,674
Campbell! You want
to explain to me

8
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:30,575
why you didn't secure
that equipment?

9
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:33,578
Make it stop. Please.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,347
Make it stop.
All-all right. All right.

11
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:36,682
Calm down, sailor.
What's wrong?

12
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:37,749
Get it out.

13
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:39,051
Hey.
Get it out of my head!

14
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:40,252
RICE: Hey, somebody
get him some water.

15
00:00:40,254 --> 00:00:42,187
Water, please.
(groaning)

16
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,723
Hey. It's okay.
No. No.

17
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:46,845
Hey, you're gonna be all
right. You're gonna be-- Hey!

SEBASTIAN:
I'm telling you, Pride,

29
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:23,661
if I'm right about this,
then I'm wrong.

30
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:25,295
Well, not that-that
I was wrong, per Se,

31
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:27,130
but just that the initial
calculations were incorrect.

32
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:28,966
But since those
came from the FBI

33
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:30,700
and not me...
Rambling.

34
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:32,535
Right, sorry.

35
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:34,338
It's an ongoing challenge.

36
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,007
We've come out here many times
in the last several weeks,

37
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,376
and have yet to find anything
to help us figure out

38
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:40,978
who killed Javier Garcia.
Okay, right.

39
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,213
Well, that-that brings us
back to the calculations.

40
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:45,215
So, we've been operating
under the belief

41
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:47,350
that the upward thrust
of the car bomb's detonator

42
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:49,920
sent the shrapnel out
in a concentric arc, right?

43
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:50,376
Yeah?

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,022
But what if the FI
never accounted

45
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:54,524
for a-a lateral dispersion?

46
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:57,594
Well, then the blast zone
would've been more asymmetrical?

47
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:58,828
Exactly.

48
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,097
Which would've sent
the shrapnel out

49
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,365
in a whole different
trajectory.

50
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,400
Now, if <i>my</i> calculations
are right,

51
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,270
we might be able
to find something...

52
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:08,371
(beeping)

53
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:09,471
...right around...

54
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:10,572
(rapid beeping)

55
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:12,408
...there.

56
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,617
Or not.

57
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:25,454
(sighs)

58
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,095
How about...
something like this?

59
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,232
Oh, yeah.

60
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:39,000
Melted metal,

61
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:40,635
outward protuberance,
yeah, yeah.

62
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:43,071
This-this could be
from the detonator.

63
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:45,140
Pride, this might be the smoking
gun we've been looking for.

64
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:48,643
Pretty charred though;
been out here a long time.

65
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:50,778
Still think you can get
trace evidence?

66
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,879
Oh, yeah, believe me,

67
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,213
if I can find anything

68
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,250
to link Mayor Hamilton
to Garcia's murder, I will.

69
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:58,218
I know how much
this means to you.

70
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,987
(phone beeping)
Thanks.

71
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:02,056
(sighs)

72
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:04,124
Well, we're gonna
have to backburner it for now.

73
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,192
We got to work.

74
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:07,261
Dead petty officer
in Belle Chasse.

75
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:08,763
Let's go.

76
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:15,735
(jet engine roaring)

77
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,471
PRIDE:
<i>What do we know, Christopher?</i>

78
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:19,206
Petty Officer Robert Campbell,

79
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,575
a member of a construction
detachment out of Gulfport,

80
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,678
took a dive from five stories up
for reasons unknown.

81
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,912
As in, he
killed himself?

82
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,280
That's what we're here
to find out.

83
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,082
That was Campbell's
officer in charge.

84
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,650
He said
before Campbell jumped,

85
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,018
he talked about
a pain in his head,

86
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,687
that he couldn't take it.

87
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,789
Okay. Any history of drug abuse,

88
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,290
psychological issues?

89
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:39,325
Well, psych eval's normal,
drug tests clean.

90
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,895
Nothing I can see here
that would raise any red flags.

91
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:43,863
I questioned
nearly every man in his unit;

92
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,764
they all said
Campbell was full of life,

93
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:47,867
the last guy
they'd expect that from.

94
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:50,103
PRIDE: A man doesn't
just jump for no reason.

95
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,106
Something drove him
over the edge.

96
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,274
Need to know what.
Loretta.

97
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,775
Well, judging from
the massive head trauma

98
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:58,844
and the hemorrhaging
from the ears, nose and mouth...

99
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:00,846
(camera clicking)

100
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:02,047
...there's no doubt
Campbell died

101
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:03,549
from the impact of the fall.

102
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,051
He complained of head pain
just before he jumped.

103
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,320
Any indication
of what caused it?

104
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:10,556
I'd have to get him
into autopsy,

105
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:13,492
but there was
one thing peculiar.

106
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,461
His eyes are jaundiced.

107
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:18,296
That didn't happen
from the fall.

108
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,100
But some pre-existing condition
could've made that happen.

109
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:23,868
Yeah, gallstones,
bile obstructions.

110
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,203
Something tells me constipation

111
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:26,804
isn't what pushed him
over the ledge.

112
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,407
LOPEZ:
Agent Pride?

113
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:30,308
Lieutenant Commander Lopez.

114
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,876
I'm sorry I wasn't here
to greet you.

115
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:33,244
I had to update
the base C.O.

116
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:34,412
Commander.

117
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:36,014
P.O. Campbell's
one of yours?

118
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:39,183
I've been overseeing
the Seabees' work here,

119
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:41,118
40 of the finest men in uniform.

120
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,589
I'm sorry for your loss.

121
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,591
Any idea why Campbell
might've done this?

122
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:48,325
No, none.

123
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,994
He's been on time and on task,
and working his tail off

124
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:53,030
with the rest of my men
to complete the install.

125
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:56,033
What is it
that you're installing here?

126
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:58,035
High-speed fiber
optic cable.

127
00:04:58,037 --> 00:04:59,736
Wiring the entire building.

128
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:03,140
Travel these men down from
Gulfport just to lay some cable?

129
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:05,609
The base's newest I.T. building.

130
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:07,044
Getting it online

131
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:09,446
is paramount
for a variety of reasons.

132
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:13,283
Do you mind if I go check up
on the rest of my men?

133
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:14,718
They're pretty shaken.

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,886
Course.

135
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:24,860
Something wrong?

136
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:26,896
No, just...

137
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:29,665
seems strange to bring down
a detachment unit

138
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,469
just to install
fiber optic cable.

139
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,237
Well, it is a pretty
specialized install.

140
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,838
LASALLE:
Hey, check this out.

141
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,007
I just did a quick rundown
on Campbell's unit.

142
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,475
Looks like he
wasn't the only one

143
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:40,542
not feeling well.

144
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:41,777
All right,
Petty Officer Bryan Howard

145
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,813
apparently checked
himself into

146
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:44,981
the base clinic
last night,

147
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:46,916
and he is now sick in quarters.

148
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:49,284
You'd think the commander
would've mentioned that.

149
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:52,421
Sebastian, go with Wade
back to the morgue,

150
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:53,422
when she's ready.

151
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:55,124
Let me know as soon
as you find out

152
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:57,259
what Campbell might've been
suffering from.

153
00:05:57,261 --> 00:06:00,862
Meanwhile, we'll go pay
Petty Officer Howard a visit.

154
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,938
I woke up in the middle
of the night,

155
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,241
felt this pressure,
like my head was gonna burst.

156
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:15,476
Thoughts weren't
making any sense.

157
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:17,245
It was scary as hell, man.

158
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:19,547
So you checked yourself
into the clinic?

159
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:22,350
Doc said I had
dehydration sickness.

160
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:25,687
Gave me some fluids,
sedatives, sent me on my way.

161
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,855
Well, you were up on that
scaffolding with Campbell

162
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:30,625
all week, exposed to the sun,
working your butt off, right?

163
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:31,859
That's right.

164
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,161
So, dehydration, heat stroke--

165
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,662
maybe that's what this is.

166
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:36,597
(coughing)

167
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,034
If that's all this is, he should
be getting better, not worse.

168
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,804
You mind?

169
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:48,542
His eyes are jaundiced,
just like Campbell's.

170
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:50,410
HOWARD: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
are you saying

171
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:52,245
whatever I've got's
what made Robert jump?

172
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:54,715
No, we're not saying
anything, sailor.

173
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:58,118
We're just trying
to figure out what happened.

174
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,387
So, you woke up
in the middle of the night,

175
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:01,421
sick.

176
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,122
Any idea what caused it?

177
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,691
I don't know.

178
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:06,526
GREGORIO: When did Campbell
start showing symptoms?

179
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:08,228
Around the same time?
Yeah, about.

180
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,497
But he just went back to bed.

181
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,299
Look, Campbell
was a beast, okay?

182
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,668
He probably could've taken
a bullet and gone back to work.

183
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,868
Anybody else get sick?

184
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,070
I mean,
something's going around.

185
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:18,370
You share any food or drink?

186
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,573
No. Although...

187
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:24,043
Although what?

188
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,679
We had a king cake
delivered to us.

189
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:27,847
We all had some.

190
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,215
Delivered by who?

191
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:32,418
The note just said,
“Welcome to Belle Chasse.”

192
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:34,553
We didn't eat
all of it.

193
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:38,090
I think Robert stashed the
rest in his foot locker.

194
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,699
Angelo Brocato's cakes.

195
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,435
Whoa.

196
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,536
King,

197
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,971
take a look at this.

198
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,507
Blood in the eyes,
foam in the mouth.

199
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,044
No way that's just from
food poisoning, right?

200
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,413
No way.

201
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:20,954
Any idea what kind of poison
we might be dealing with here?

202
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,220
I've tested all the
usual suspects--

203
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:26,790
cyanide, arsenic, strychnine--
they all came back negative.

204
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:30,093
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, and I checked for ricin,
sarin and poison arrow frog.

205
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:31,027
No match.

206
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,596
Still, some type
of poison

207
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:34,998
mutated Petty Officer
Campbell's cells,

208
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,566
caused severe brain swelling.

209
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:39,102
That explains
what drove him off the ledge.

210
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:41,104
You know, tetrodotoxin
could've caused cell mutation,

211
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,473
but it... it's faster acting
than what killed Campbell.

212
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:44,874
Have you checked for polonium?

213
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:46,109
Hey.

214
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:49,112
Why aren't the two of you
working side by side?

215
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:51,814
Sebastian's a bit
of a hypochondriac.

216
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:54,550
Or, you know, some people
might just say extra careful.

217
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:56,419
You know. I-I have
a thing about poisons.

218
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:58,321
It's like how some people are

219
00:08:58,323 --> 00:09:02,190
afraid of snakes or spiders or..
circus clowns, you know.

220
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,160
Four more Seabees from
Campbell's unit were just

221
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:06,461
admitted into a clinic,

222
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,664
and Petty Officer Howard
is getting sicker.

223
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,965
The base C.O. is isolating them

224
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,433
until they know
what's causing it.

225
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:13,135
WADE: It's odd
that it's affecting people

226
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,270
at vastly different rates.

227
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:16,705
Poisons don't usually
work that way.

228
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:19,041
Then we need
to find out what does

229
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:20,375
before we lose anyone else.

230
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:22,477
Sebastian, work <i>with</i> Loretta,

231
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,878
side by side, and learn things.

232
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,047
Okay, but the...

233
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:28,116
Need to know who ordered
that cake, Patton.

234
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:30,085
And I wish I can tell you,
but I can't

235
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,719
get anybody from the bakery
on the phone.

236
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,321
This time of day,
that's strange.

237
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,389
Yeah, but I did check
with the base, and according to

238
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,959
their gate log, Angelo Brocato
did, in fact, deliver a cake

239
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:40,662
at 21:00 hours.
Addressed to who?

240
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,864
No name in particular,
just Barracks 53.

241
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,033
Campbell's unit.
Sounds like they were targeted.

242
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,268
Why? Bunch of Seabees
installing cables.

243
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,003
Yeah, maybe not.

244
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,538
Christopher, Gregorio,
go to Angelo Brocato's.

245
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
I want to know
who sent that cake.

246
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,708
Patton, search
surveillance cameras

247
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,343
around the bakery,

248
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,446
I.D. everyone who came in
and out of there yesterday.

249
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:00,448
Copy that.
Who you calling?

250
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,283
Belle Chasse.
Commander Lopez, please.

251
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:04,651
I want to know what those
Seabees were really doing.

252
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:07,220
Tell her
it's Agent Pride, NCIS.

253
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,394
(vehicle door closes)

254
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,733
Excuse me.

255
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,201
Federal agents.
You work here?

256
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,368
Um, yeah.

257
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,769
Why? Is there
something wrong?

258
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:26,005
The bakery usually closed
at this hour?

259
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,340
No.

260
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:29,175
Should've been open hours ago.

261
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:30,910
I mean, I just got here
for my afternoon shift.

262
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:32,979
I don't know why
my boss didn't call me.

263
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:35,982
Honestly, I'm a
little worried.

264
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:39,252
(door creaks)

265
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:52,798
(door creaks)

266
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,001
Door's open.

267
00:11:17,758 --> 00:11:21,826
Oh, no. Jaundiced eyes
and foaming at the mouth.

268
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,996
Same symptoms
as the Seabees.

269
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:26,698
From sampling the same cake?

270
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,232
I don't think so.

271
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,768
He's got defensive wounds
on his arms and hands.

272
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,303
Looks like he put up a fight.

273
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:33,771
And lost.

274
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:37,941
What in the world
is going on here?

275
00:11:37,943 --> 00:11:39,810
(sighs)

276
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,914
Richard Logan's been working
at Angelo Brocato's

277
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,983
for as long as
I can remember.

278
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:47,985
Yeah, best pastry chef
they've got, too.

279
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:50,020
Folks order
his king cakes by name.

280
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:52,522
Only way he would've poisoned
the Seabees' cake...

281
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:54,925
Is if he was forced
into doing it.

282
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:56,827
Doc says the killer
knocked out Logan

283
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,762
and must have injected him

284
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,664
with the same poison
that killed our Seabee.

285
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,965
She got time of death?

286
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:03,733
Yes. Between 9:00
and 10:00 last night,

287
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:05,569
which, according to
Patton, is the same time

288
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,304
the cake was delivered
to the base.

289
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:10,473
So killer waits for
customers to leave,

290
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,609
forces the baker
to poison the cake,

291
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:15,178
and then waits... until
it's delivered to kill him? Why?

292
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,646
Killer probably
didn't want

293
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:19,215
Logan to I.D. him--
tried to cover his tracks.

294
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:21,450
Yeah, but by leaving
Logan's body for us to find,

295
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:22,852
it does anything but.

296
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:24,020
Sloppy.

297
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:25,621
It doesn't make sense.
Yeah.

298
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:27,156
Still, you think
our Seabees were targeted?

299
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:28,758
No reason not to.

300
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,360
Especially since I can't get
in contact with Commander Lopez.

301
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:32,929
Even checked with her C.O.

302
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:35,198
at Gulfport.
Think she went U.A.?

303
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,832
The base C.O.
at Belle Chasse checked

304
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,367
the exit logs;
says that she left

305
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:40,168
right after we did this morning.

306
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,804
So, wait, are we thinking
she's a suspect now?

307
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:44,640
Well, only way to know
is to find her.

308
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:46,108
PATTON: Ah. One step
ahead of y'all.

309
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,576
Check it out.

310
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,411
I was combing through
surveillance footage

311
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:51,113
around the bakery.

312
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:53,148
Not a suspicious
customer in sight,

313
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,651
until... I decided
to expand my search window.

314
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,386
Voila.

315
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:01,089
Commander Lopez.

316
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:02,523
Lopez? What is
she doing there?

317
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:03,691
When was this taken?

318
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:04,860
About a hour and a half ago.

319
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:06,762
That's right before
Tammy and I got there.

320
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:08,163
Think we chased her away?

321
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:10,598
Well, still, what was she doing
there in the first place?

322
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,768
Especially considering the baker
had been dead for hours.

323
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,104
Yeah, too many things don't add
up, and no one's talking to us.

324
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:19,039
I'll call Director Vance.

325
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,309
See if he can cut
through this bureaucracy.

326
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:22,943
Guys, we got big problems.

327
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:24,646
WADE: Yeah, I'm afraid
it's not good, Dwayne.

328
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,013
No, it's worse than not good.

329
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,649
It turns out that the cake
wasn't spiked with a poison,

330
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:30,017
it was injected with a virus.

331
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,219
When I couldn't identify
the poison, I rechecked

332
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:34,054
the molecular structure
of the affected cells...

333
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,490
And discovered that
it was actually infested

334
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:38,225
with microscopic,

335
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,294
single-strand RNAs.

336
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:41,361
Which means virus?

337
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,596
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, but not just any virus.

338
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:44,531
A supervirus--
we're talking

339
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,434
Congolese hemorrhagic fever,
dengue, Ebola

340
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:48,368
all rolled into one.

341
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,369
Is it contagious?

342
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,038
Very. But fortunately
not airborne.

343
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,774
SEBASTIAN: Right.
The only way to contract it is

344
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:55,342
either through ingestion,
like with the king cake,

345
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:57,511
or by touch,
so any skin-to-skin contact

346
00:13:57,513 --> 00:13:59,512
with the infected
can risk exposure.

347
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,314
Means anyone
who's been around our Seabees

348
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:02,982
or the cake could get it.

349
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:04,417
The whole base
could be in danger.

350
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:05,685
So could we.

351
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:08,154
Except none of us
have shown any symptoms yet.

352
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,722
Still no reason
to take chances.

353
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,158
We stay put in the office
till we all get tested.

354
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,026
Is there a cure?

355
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:14,294
Not that I know of.

356
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:15,628
LASALLE:
King.

357
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,163
This could be more than
just an attack on our Seabees.

358
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:19,799
Could be bioterrorism.

359
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:23,536
Get the base C.O.
on the phone.

360
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:25,103
We're gonna lock down
Belle Chasse.

361
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:26,839
We cannot let this get out.

362
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,006
Dwayne.

363
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,676
(panting)

364
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:32,477
I'm afraid it already has.

365
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:02,471
MAN:
Dr. Wade?

366
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:04,472
Oh, please,
we're wasting valuable time.

367
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,274
Let me just work.
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:09,510
Loretta!

369
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,580
Loretta.

370
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:16,117
Talk to me, Loretta.
How did this happen?

371
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:17,886
(sighs)
It must have happened

372
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:19,054
at the crime scene.

373
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:22,123
Without my scrub suit on,
my skin was exposed.

374
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,424
And you handled Campbell's body?

375
00:15:23,426 --> 00:15:28,028
Yeah. Blood particulates,
saliva, sweat.

376
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,298
Doesn't take much.

377
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:33,934
I assume you and your
team are all right.

378
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,470
Yeah, we-we all tested negative.

379
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:37,237
Ah, thank God
for that.

380
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,039
Sebastian cleared, too.

381
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,774
(laughs)

382
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:43,043
Next time, remind me
not to tease him

383
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:45,746
about being a hypochondriac--
it may have saved his life.

384
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:47,948
(coughing loudly)

385
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:52,786
Should you rest, Loretta?

386
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:54,254
There's no time to rest,

387
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:56,089
not with others
being infected, too,

388
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:57,557
and more to come

389
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,560
if we can't stop this
virus from spreading.

390
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:03,497
The situation at
Belle Chasse?

391
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:06,433
Base is locked down,
the sick quarantined.

392
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:08,935
Marine Chemical and Biological
Incident Response Force

393
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:10,637
is on its way.

394
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,772
How many infected so far?

395
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,207
Seven total--
four of Campbell's Seabees,

396
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,044
three machinists who shared
the barracks with them.

397
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,379
Burn their clothing,
all their belongings.

398
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:22,148
It's not airborne,

399
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,417
but obviously it's
highly contagious.

400
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:29,155
Deadly, if we can't
find the cure.

401
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,623
How much time do we have?

402
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,959
You mean how much
time do <i>I</i> have?

403
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,894
Well...

404
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:39,231
the virus affects
everybody differently.

405
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:42,868
But I am monitoring my
viral load while I work,

406
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,039
see how quickly it mutates
my white blood cells.

407
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,341
I would say maybe...

408
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,611
ten, 11 hours before...

409
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,952
I can't believe
that this is happening.

410
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,954
How's she doing?

411
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,956
Scared, like the rest of us.

412
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,892
She's counting on us, Sebastian.

413
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:11,028
Stay focused,
for everybody's sake.

414
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,030
Yeah, easier said than done.

415
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,765
(computer beeps)

416
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,501
Got a match
from the viral database.

417
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,737
QR6.
What is that?

418
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,139
It's a-a supervirus developed
by the Chinese military,

419
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,775
but supposedly, it
never left their lab.

420
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,078
Pride, if this is right, then
this has to be bioterrorism.

421
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,946
I mean, there's no
two ways about it.

422
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,280
But why now? Why Belle Chasse?

423
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,548
I don't know.

424
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,050
I mean, the only good news
is that there's no way

425
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:36,119
they would have developed
this lethal a bug

426
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,721
without also developing
an antidote.

427
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,656
So even if Loretta
can't come up with a cure...

428
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,425
Yeah, then we can,
as long as we can

429
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,693
find whoever infected
that king cake.

430
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,294
'Cause they'll
probably have the antidote,

431
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,029
since they don't want
to get infected, too.

432
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,897
Only problem is we don't
have that much time.

433
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,432
All right, stay here,
help Loretta.

434
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:50,911
Wait, hold on, you got
to get me on that base.

435
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:51,501
What?

436
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:53,269
Victims are being infected
at different rates, right?

437
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,205
Which means some are
more resistant to the virus than others.

438
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,975
If I can test their blood, then
maybe I can create my own cure.

439
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,910
I'm-I'm not willing to risk
you getting sick, too...

440
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:02,411
That's not your choice!

441
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:06,982
Please, Pride.

442
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:08,384
I-I know that you want

443
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:10,286
to do everything you
can to save Loretta,

444
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,654
but so do I, all right?

445
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:13,956
I-I can't lose her.

446
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:16,959
(sighs)

447
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:21,564
We're not gonna lose her,
Sebastian.

448
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:28,603
I'll get you on with
the Marine Bio Response Force.

449
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:31,073
You work with them,
but listen to me--

450
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,474
Hazmat suit,

451
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,109
wrist tape, the works.

452
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,979
I can't lose <i>you,</i> either.

453
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,752
Oh, wait. Pride.

454
00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:44,952
Pride.

455
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:46,821
I almost forgot. Uh...

456
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:48,690
I was able to get a
partial fingerprint

457
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,091
off of that, uh,
Garcia shrapnel.

458
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:51,660
It's not enough
for an I.D.,

459
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,495
and obviously it's no
way to tie the bombing

460
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:55,963
to Mayor Hamilton,
but it's a start.

461
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:57,932
Okay, wh-why are you
showing me this now?

462
00:18:57,934 --> 00:19:00,835
Just, you know, in case
something happens to me.

463
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,175
We'll work on this later,
Sebastian, together.

464
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:08,409
(phone ringing)

465
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:10,344
Focus.

466
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:13,580
Agent Pride.

467
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:17,518
♪ ♪

468
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:34,367
Just got off the phone with the
Office of Naval Intelligence.

469
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,769
Finally admitted that
Commander Lopez and her team

470
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:38,905
were doing
more than just

471
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:41,041
installing cable
at Belle Chasse.

472
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:43,076
More, meaning what?
Don't know yet.

473
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:45,911
ONI needs clearance
to get us read in.

474
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:48,614
Apparently, it's top secret,
compartmentalized.

475
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:50,450
They want to keep it that way

476
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:52,151
until they can get
more specifics

477
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:54,253
about what the Chinese
are really after.

478
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:56,288
Targeting Seabees
on a top secret project

479
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,957
not specific
enough for them?

480
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,593
The less people know
exactly what the project is,

481
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:03,528
the better,
far as they're concerned.

482
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,766
ONI just wants us focusing on
catching whoever's responsible.

483
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:10,035
What about Commander Lopez?
Did they hear from her?

484
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:11,937
No. And they're worried.

485
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:14,673
Turns out they're the ones
who sent her to the bakery

486
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:16,308
to quietly investigate.

487
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,910
Well, maybe she heard about
the king cake from her men.

488
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:20,979
At least that explains
why she was there.

489
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:22,280
Yeah, but not why
she disappeared.

490
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:23,782
You find anything
on the watch list?

491
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,985
Yeah, a list of Chinese
nationals linked to MSS,

492
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,187
but it'll take us all week
to narrow it down.

493
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:30,389
Loretta doesn't have all week

494
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:32,156
and neither do
the other victims.

495
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:34,792
We need another way to find out
who did this, fast.

496
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:36,660
Might have
something in here.

497
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:38,496
Been I.D.-ing
every person and car

498
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,331
in or around Angelo Brocato's

499
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,233
around the time
of the baker's murder.

500
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:44,168
Nothing came up until...

501
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,505
We matched the license plate
to a silver Toyota 4Runner

502
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,207
reported stolen two days ago
driving by.

503
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,741
Time stamp: 9:33 p.m.

504
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:52,309
Could be a coincidence, or...

505
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:54,044
Could be our operatives.
Good work.

506
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,147
I'll put a BOLO out,
notify LSP and FBI, too.

507
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:58,882
Should we trigger EAS,
go wide?

508
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,750
I mean, it's just...
No, no, no, no, no.

509
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:02,819
The media gets ahold of this
and puts it out there,

510
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,587
could cause a panic
that the virus

511
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:06,323
is gonna spread
beyond the base.

512
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:09,526
Make it all that more difficult
to find our operatives.

513
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:11,060
Well, the health department
already knows.

514
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,796
They quarantined Wade's morgue.

515
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:14,798
It's just a matter of time
before the media finds out.

516
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,399
Yep, and stokes
public fear.

517
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,902
We have to keep this contained.

518
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,139
Only one way to do that.

519
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:27,910
Let me know
when you find that car.

520
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,578
Where's he going?

521
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,448
I bet it's the last place
he wants to go.

522
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:35,517
(trolley bell clanging)

523
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,819
<i>(Hamilton chuckles)</i>

524
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:39,088
You got stones, Dwayne,
I'll give you that much.

525
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,224
Last thing we both need is for
the media to get ahold of this.

526
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:44,693
They've already contacted
my office, more than once.

527
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:48,229
Media hysteria is not gonna help
me find out who's responsible.

528
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:49,965
In fact, it'll hurt the cause.

529
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:54,402
I got a lead, just need
a day or two, maybe less.

530
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:56,905
Still, I couldn't very
well lie to the people.

531
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:59,074
I wouldn't be a very good mayor
if I did, now would I?

532
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:02,143
Apparently the Office of Public
Health is getting calls, too.

533
00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:05,080
They're asking for an
official statement.

534
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:08,016
And by the way,
how's Loretta doing?

535
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,589
Real shame, isn't it?

536
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:17,024
So, what?

537
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:19,393
You're gonna make this personal,
is that it?

538
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:21,696
This is about trying
to stop an outbreak,

539
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:23,764
saving innocent people;
this isn't about us, Hamilton.

540
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:25,199
The hell it's not about us.

541
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:28,135
Everything's about us
since Garcia.

542
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:30,037
You may not see this,
Dwayne, but the truth is

543
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,907
we both want the same thing:
what's good for this city.

544
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:35,042
The only problem
is that you think

545
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:36,943
that bringing me down
is the best way to do that,

546
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:38,578
and I can't allow
that to happen.

547
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,182
So what do you want?

548
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:45,352
I want whatever you got on me.

549
00:22:45,354 --> 00:22:47,287
Whatever you <i>think</i> you got.

550
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:48,622
Vis-à-vis Garcia.

551
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:49,990
Sounds like an admission to me.

552
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:51,190
Not admitting anything.

553
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:53,393
I just want you off my
back once and for all.

554
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:55,461
So you're threatening
to impede my investigation,

555
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:58,865
risk causing widespread fear
just to cover your own ass?

556
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,366
You're the one
doing the threatening,

557
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:01,968
and I'm not gonna stand for it,

558
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,603
not anymore,
even if it means getting you

559
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:05,639
and your whole damn team
kicked out of New Orleans.

560
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:07,473
NCIS is federal.

561
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:10,076
You don't have the power
or the jurisdiction...

562
00:23:10,078 --> 00:23:11,911
Oh, man, jurisdiction
doesn't mean anything

563
00:23:11,913 --> 00:23:13,846
if you got connections.

564
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:16,215
And me and SECDEF go way back,

565
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:17,583
believe me.

566
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:20,119
Apparently, there's
something called

567
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:21,421
a mobility agreement.

568
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:22,988
Says that if
Navy brass thinks

569
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,290
NCIS and the city
aren't getting along,

570
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:28,160
well, they can re-assign
you to God knows where.

571
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:32,031
Gloves are off, Dwayne.

572
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:33,966
You want my help, hmm?

573
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:36,134
Cooperation?
That only happens

574
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:39,704
you get me everything you got
on Garcia by this time tomorrow.

575
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:41,540
Understand?

576
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,981
GREGORIO:
We didn't get a BOLO hit,

577
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:52,517
but Patton's been tracking
satellite radio signals

578
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,052
from every 4Runner in the area,

579
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:55,387
when one suddenly vanished.

580
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:57,488
I think we just found it.
Gregorio.

581
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,190
LASALLE: Look at this.
What is it?

582
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,293
LASALLE:
I'm pretty sure it's Lopez.

583
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:06,497
Lopez is inside, Pride.

584
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:08,332
She's dead.

585
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:10,434
Must've caught her
investigating.

586
00:24:10,436 --> 00:24:12,436
Two more in the backseat.

587
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:15,539
Wait. Two more?

588
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,041
Who are they?

589
00:24:18,043 --> 00:24:21,545
I just got DNA I.D.s
on both victims,

590
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:24,515
but I'm afraid you're
not gonna like this.

591
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:26,617
(clears throat)
They're marines.

592
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:28,785
I'm sending the files
to you now.

593
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:30,420
(coughing)

594
00:24:30,422 --> 00:24:32,956
Loretta, you have
to lie down.

595
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,591
We've been through this, Dwayne.

596
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:37,694
We both know I'm not the only
one running out of time.

597
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:41,297
LASALLE: Wait a second,
those aren't just any marines.

598
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,233
All right? They're part of
a Biological Response Force

599
00:24:43,235 --> 00:24:44,735
that was headed
for Belle Chasse.

600
00:24:44,737 --> 00:24:46,469
GREGORIO: Wait,
operatives killed Lopez

601
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:48,471
because she was investigating
them-- that much I get.

602
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:50,673
But why intercept and kill
the other two?

603
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:52,808
Try to keep them
from stopping the outbreak?

604
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,677
LASALLE: Hold on.
According to the Belle Chasse

605
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:57,013
entry log,
Corporals Davis and Lin

606
00:24:57,015 --> 00:24:59,715
just checked in at the main gate
along with their unit.

607
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:01,317
GREGORIO: So operatives
must have snuck in,

608
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,752
killed them while
they were traveling

609
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:04,319
with the marine convoy.

610
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:07,089
But they did all that
just to steal their I.D.s?

611
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,658
LASALLE: Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

612
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,393
I mean, if they're with the
people that infected the base,

613
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:12,962
that'd be the last place
they'd want to go.

614
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:13,963
Dwayne.

615
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:15,464
I know, I know.

616
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:16,999
Sebastian's at Belle Chasse

617
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,500
waiting for the Response Force.

618
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:20,969
Which means he has no idea
who those people really are.

619
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:22,137
(clears throat)

620
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,005
SEBASTIAN: <i>You guys from</i>
<i>the Response Force?</i>

621
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:26,841
Yeah. Lance Corporal Lin, Davis.

622
00:25:26,843 --> 00:25:28,544
Rest of the team's on its way.

623
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:30,212
Who are you?
NCIS, Forensic Agent Lund.

624
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:32,181
I'm here to figure out
how this all happened,

625
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:34,349
but more importantly,
how we can stop it.

626
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:35,817
Come on,
let's get geared up.

627
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:38,787
Straight to voice mail.

628
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:39,921
We got to get to the base.

629
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:41,189
(coughing)

630
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,290
Christopher, keep calling

631
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,125
Sebastian on his cell.

632
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,326
I'll call ONI.

633
00:25:45,328 --> 00:25:46,360
Gregorio,

634
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:48,029
get the base police

635
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:49,297
to secure Belle Chasse,

636
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,265
put the gates on high alert.

637
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:55,336
Loretta, I'll call you as soon
as we know anything, promise.

638
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:58,206
(coughing, wheezing)

639
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,710
Hey! Dr. Wade!

640
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:18,197
(monitor beeping)

641
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:20,400
DOCTOR: Last antibiotic
isn't working, either.

642
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:21,567
Get me carbapenem, stat.

643
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:22,835
Let's intubate her.

644
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:25,504
Come on, come on.
Hurry up, people.

645
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:28,674
If we want to save her,
we've got to stabilize her.

646
00:26:28,676 --> 00:26:31,710
PRIDE:
Is she conscious, talking?

647
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:33,512
All right, you tell her
to take care

648
00:26:33,514 --> 00:26:35,748
and that we're out here doing
everything we can on our end.

649
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,583
Thank you.
How's Wade?

650
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:39,785
Thinking about putting her
in a medically induced coma

651
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:41,853
to slow her metabolism,
buy time.

652
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:43,656
How much time
she have?

653
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:45,223
Not much.
Agent Pride.

654
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:46,925
I'm Captain Rogers,
Base Commanding Officer here.

655
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:48,694
Any luck finding my agent?

656
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:51,163
Not yet, but it's a large base;
we're still searching.

657
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,899
But we're under full lockdown,
every access point guarded.

658
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:55,500
Operatives won't
be able to escape

659
00:26:55,502 --> 00:26:57,269
without going through us.
Okay, well, the problem is

660
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:58,703
we got to take them alive.

661
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:00,704
They may be the only ones
with an antidote.

662
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:02,039
Still can't
reach Sebastian, King.

663
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,740
Why would he
turn off his phone?

664
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:05,810
He wouldn't.

665
00:27:05,812 --> 00:27:09,213
Is there a secure area on base
where cell phones are jammed?

666
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:10,547
DOWNEY:
Yes, there is.

667
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:12,149
Commander Downey,
Naval Intelligence.

668
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:13,650
We spoke earlier. Follow me.
Yes, sir.

669
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:15,085
LASALLE: Looks like
we finally got clearance.

670
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:16,753
Hopefully. Better
late than never.

671
00:27:16,755 --> 00:27:19,289
I'll download you on the way.
I got a vehicle.

672
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:25,161
SEBASTIAN: I still
don't know why we're here

673
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:26,863
or why we're wearing
protective gear.

674
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:28,565
P.O. Campbell's blood
particulates could be anywhere.

675
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:29,966
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, but the area's
already been cleared.

676
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:31,635
What we need to be doing
is testing the infected

677
00:27:31,637 --> 00:27:33,336
for resistant antibodies.

678
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:35,571
This is our jurisdiction,
Agent Lund,

679
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:37,773
not yours.

680
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:41,010
There a problem?
No. Everything's good.

681
00:27:41,012 --> 00:27:42,745
LIN: All right. Check for
residual contamination

682
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,147
out here, we'll check inside.

683
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:46,282
Let's go.

684
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:59,829
(panting)

685
00:28:09,874 --> 00:28:11,874
Crap.

686
00:28:17,915 --> 00:28:21,016
We think the biological attack
was really just a diversion

687
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:22,817
to get the operatives on base.

688
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:24,952
By killing
the Marine Response Force.

689
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,188
Because they knew they'd be
the first ones called in,

690
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,189
Navy 911.

691
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:29,524
DOWNEY:
Exactly.

692
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:31,926
But to do what?
Why go through all this?

693
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:33,661
Smokescreen?
Probably.

694
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:35,563
Best way to breach
a highly-secure area:

695
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:37,098
create widespread panic.

696
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,700
Commander Lopez's team

697
00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:42,169
was installing secure cables
to what D.O.D. had hoped

698
00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:44,038
would become the first
ship activation center

699
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,507
east of San Diego.
Ship activation?

700
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:48,542
You have to understand
how Navy ships work.

701
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:50,311
They're basically just
floating hunks of metal

702
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,779
until they're programmed
into warships.

703
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:54,315
<i>It's a highly classified</i>
<i>procedure,</i>

704
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,850
and the hope was this base
could expand our reach.

705
00:28:56,852 --> 00:28:58,251
The more ships activated,

706
00:28:58,253 --> 00:29:00,020
the more the Chinese
have to contend with.

707
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:01,154
They don't want that to happen.

708
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,089
At all costs, apparently.

709
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:04,558
So what do they want?

710
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,493
How do they expect to stop
the programming?

711
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,629
Steal the ship activation CPU

712
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:10,531
and all the stored Intel.

713
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:13,033
Make D.O.D. lose faith
in Belle Chasse.

714
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:16,702

Understood. Please, though,
just do everything you can.

739
00:31:41,912 --> 00:31:44,212
I should have known the moment
I saw that those operatives

740
00:31:44,214 --> 00:31:45,851
didn't tape up their wrists--
I don't know how I missed it.

741
00:31:45,852 --> 00:31:49,086
Sebastian, you did your best.
You-you followed them,

742
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:50,797
you engaged them.
You-you were outgunned.

743
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:51,590
That's not what I mean.

744
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:53,258
I mean, I knew that they were
bad guys, it just didn't

745
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,992
occur to me that the only reason
they weren't afraid

746
00:31:54,994 --> 00:31:57,462
of being infected was
'cause they had been inoculated.

747
00:31:57,464 --> 00:31:59,229
The antidote was already
in their system.

748
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:00,698
I should've
figured that out sooner.

749
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,033
Wouldn't have
made any difference.

750
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:04,401
They weren't gonna
be taken alive.

751
00:32:04,403 --> 00:32:06,570
They're trained
to protect state secrets.

752
00:32:06,572 --> 00:32:08,405
All right?
No matter the cost.

753
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:11,241
Sebastian, hey,
can you duplicate it?

754
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:13,778
I'm-I'm trying to separate
the antibodies right now,

755
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,413
but Wade doesn't
have that much time.

756
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:19,049
Hey, King, Patton may have
found something

757
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:20,717
off the activation CPU...

758
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,085
I don't care about the case
right now, Christopher.

759
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:24,154
It's not about the case,
it's about Wade.

760
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:26,323
We found the CPU hooked up
to the docking station

761
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:27,724
in the operative's van.

762
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:29,359
They were uploading it
to someone while we were

763
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:31,494
chasing them.
Yeah, someone off-site.

764
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:33,529
They must've knew they weren't
getting out of there alive.

765
00:32:33,531 --> 00:32:35,198
But they still wanted
to transfer the Intel

766
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,632
to whoever
they were working for,

767
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:37,867
probably the handler.

768
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:39,069
Can you trace the signal?

769
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:40,336
That's why we're calling.

770
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:42,138
Tracking down
the receiver's I.P. address,

771
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,372
vectoring the location.
Stand by.

772
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:44,507
Pride, if we can
find the handler...

773
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:45,875
There's a good chance
he might have

774
00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:47,310
the antidote on him
as a precaution.

775
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:48,777
Got it, sending it now.

776
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,779
Alferd Supply
in Chalmette.

777
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:52,515
We'll meet you there.

778
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:55,218

779
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,064
NCIS! Get your hands up!

780
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,900
Federal agents! Don't move!

781
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,203
Hey!

782
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:17,404
(panting)

783
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:23,344
Cyanide.

784
00:33:23,346 --> 00:33:25,813
Clear.
Okay. Start searching everywhere.

785
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,115
That antidote's
got to be here somewhere.

786
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:30,150
So we're not
wasting time here.

787
00:33:30,152 --> 00:33:31,885
You are under arrest for murder,

788
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,187
terrorism, espionage.

789
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:35,623
But I don't care
about any of that.

790
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,658
All I want is to get
the antidote to the virus.

791
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,426
Virus? What virus?

792
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:40,761
You do not want
to mess with me right now,

793
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:41,995
do you understand that?

794
00:33:41,997 --> 00:33:43,363
My friend is dying
because of you,

795
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:44,397
and if you don't
help me save her...

796
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,266
I'm not afraid to die.

797
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,568
SEBASTIAN:
No?

798
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,404
Not quickly, maybe, but...

799
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,439
how about slowly?

800
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,744
Painfully,
like all your victims.

801
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:03,683
You know, uh,
injecting the baker

802
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,718
directly with
the virus...

803
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:14,260
...that must've made his death
that much more excruciating.

804
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:16,061
His brain probably
swelled up immediately,

805
00:34:16,063 --> 00:34:18,463
lungs filled with blood,
drowning him,

806
00:34:18,465 --> 00:34:20,365
convulsions.

807
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:24,569
You can't do this.

808
00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:26,438
(grunts)

809
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:30,242
He can't, but I can.

810
00:34:30,244 --> 00:34:32,844
And there's nobody's
here to stop me.

811
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:35,447
(grunts)
No, wait! The table!

812
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,949
The antidote's
under the card table!

813
00:34:39,052 --> 00:34:40,919
Got it.

814
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:44,423
All right, get it to the
base and Loretta. Hurry!

815
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:46,391
Sebastian.

816
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:48,059
Were you really
gonna inject him?

817
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:50,228
For her, yeah.

818
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,730
Get going.

819
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:57,401
What now?

820
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:58,803
Now we're gonna book you.

821
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,104
We got a treasure trove

822
00:35:00,106 --> 00:35:01,940
of incriminating evidence
against you.

823
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:05,109
Probably the only way
to get out of the death penalty

824
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:07,277
is if you admit
to who you're working for.

825
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,613
You're not getting that
out of me.

826
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:11,582
Well, I don't think it's us
you got to worry about.

827
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:14,752
Oh, no, that's NSA
and DHS territory,

828
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:16,954
but if my memory serves me,
Guantanamo...

829
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:18,756
(gunshot)

830
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:22,893
What the hell?

831
00:35:22,895 --> 00:35:24,962
Someone just shot him
through a friggin' brick wall!

832
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:33,303
(whispers):
Okay.

833
00:35:45,316 --> 00:35:46,983
Bullet casing.

834
00:35:50,154 --> 00:35:51,855
Still warm.

835
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:54,758
Is that .50 caliber?

836
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,393
Not just any .50 caliber.

837
00:35:57,395 --> 00:35:58,827
Penetrates through a brick wall

838
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,863
without line of sight
and still hits its target?

839
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:04,533
It's got to be DARPA,
thermal scope, heat seeking.

840
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:06,135
Must have been another operative

841
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:08,570
who wanted to make sure
that this one didn't talk.

842
00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:10,973
Except I don't think
the operative was Chinese.

843
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:12,974
This is U.S. technology, Pride.

844
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:14,943
It's brand-new, too.

845
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:18,313
Which means whoever did this
had to be homegrown American.

846
00:36:24,522 --> 00:36:27,523
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

847
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:29,891
Knock, knock.

848
00:36:29,893 --> 00:36:31,393
Hey!
Hey.

849
00:36:31,395 --> 00:36:33,028
(chuckles)

850
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,030
How you feeling?

851
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,333
That's sort of
a stupid question, I know.

852
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:40,435
I'm sorry. It's--
I-I don't know how to act

853
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:41,869
in situations like this.
I mean, obviously,

854
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:43,471
after everything
you've been through,

855
00:36:43,473 --> 00:36:45,372
you're not feeling great,
but at the same time,

856
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:47,174
I don't know what I'm...
Sebastian.

857
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:49,109
Just ask me again.

858
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:50,645
How you feeling?

859
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:52,713
I feel like crap.

860
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:56,551
But I'm alive and I'll take it,
thanks to you.

861
00:36:56,553 --> 00:36:58,252
Thanks to me? No, I can't...

862
00:36:58,254 --> 00:36:59,587
Oh, don't even go there.

863
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:01,855
Pride already told me
what you did.

864
00:37:01,857 --> 00:37:03,757
Said you saved my life.

865
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:05,259
I mean...

866
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:07,161
I didn't, you know.

867
00:37:07,163 --> 00:37:08,395
Not really.
Not by myself.

868
00:37:08,397 --> 00:37:10,064
It was sort of, like, a group...
Come here.

869
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,298
Want to give you a hug.

870
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:15,169
Mm.

871
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:17,271
Thank you.

872
00:37:17,273 --> 00:37:18,772
Anytime.

873
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:24,811
I'm proud of you,
Sebastian.

874
00:37:24,813 --> 00:37:28,448
You faced your fears.

875
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,185
You risked your life
to save others.

876
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:35,388
I heard you even
threatened to go a little rogue.

877
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,722
That's what I heard.

878
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:39,125
Yeah, well, you know.

879
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:41,294
Guess that means I'm finally
becoming a real agent.

880
00:37:41,296 --> 00:37:42,328
No.

881
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:46,432
Means you're finally
becoming yourself.

882
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:01,146
Hey.

883
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:02,948
Am I interrupting?

884
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,583
No.

885
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:06,619
No. What's up?
Just thought you'd like to know

886
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:08,387
I checked with the medic
at Belle Chasse.

887
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:10,122
Everyone's recovering.

888
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:13,825
Good. Good.

889
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:17,195
Kind of a major whirlwind
last couple of days, huh?

890
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:19,431
I still can't believe
everything that happened.

891
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:22,134
And everything
that almost happened.

892
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:24,268
Right? So strange, though.

893
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,770
All that goes down
all the time,

894
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:27,772
public never even
knows about it.

895
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:30,374
Not easy keeping it
that way sometimes.

896
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:37,415
Something else?

897
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:38,650
Yeah.

898
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,185
I, uh, got a
partial fingerprint

899
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:44,788
on the .50 caliber cartridge
that killed our handler.

900
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,190
You get an I.D.?
No.

901
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:47,591
But I think you'll
find this interesting.

902
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:50,227
Turns out the print
matches the partial

903
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:54,031
Sebastian lifted off of Garcia's
detonator you guys found.

904
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:56,233
Yep.

905
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:58,468
Same person
killed both people.

906
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,506
But wait.

907
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,341
If that's true,
then that would mean...

908
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,543
That would mean

909
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,378
the killer's working
for Mayor Hamilton,

910
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,713
which also means

911
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,648
Hamilton could be
behind both killings.

912
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,849
And, if so,

913
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,650
whatever the good mayor
is up to

914
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,519
is a lot bigger than we thought.

915
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,223
No wonder he's trying
to threaten us.

916
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,599
You're late, Dwayne.

917
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,200
Thought you weren't
gonna show.

918
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,403
Wouldn't want to
disappoint you, Mr. Mayor.

919
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,739
Good, I'm glad.

920
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,340
That for me?

921
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,511
Yeah.

922
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,551
Whoa, wait, wait.
Wh-What is this?

923
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:54,022
I told you I wanted everything
you had on Garcia's murder.

924
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,357
I remember.

925
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,212
Gloves are off.

926
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:03,549
Your words.
