1
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:24,336
嘿 搞什么鬼
Hey, what the hell?

2
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:25,771
你差点要了我的命
You could've killed me!

3
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:26,872
你干什么呢
What are you doing?!

4
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:28,674
Campbell 你想向我解释
Campbell! You want to explain to me

5
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:30,575
为什么没接住那桶工具吗
why you didn't secure that equipment?

6
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:33,578
让它停下来 拜托
Make it stop. Please.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,347
-让它停下来 -别怕 没事的
- Make it stop. - All-all right. All right.

8
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:36,682
冷静 士兵 怎么了
Calm down, sailor. What's wrong?

9
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:37,749
把它弄出去
Get it out.

10
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:39,051
-嘿 -把它从我的脑袋里弄出去
- Hey. - Get it out of my head!

11
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:40,252
嘿 来人给他些水
Hey, somebody get him some water.

12
00:00:40,254 --> 00:00:42,187
水 谢谢
Water, please.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,723
-嘿 没事的 -不 不
- Hey. It's okay. - No. No.

14
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:46,845
嘿 你会没事的 没事 嘿
Hey, you're gonna be all right. You're gonna be-- Hey!

21
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,550
NCIS <font color=#00FF00>新奥尔良</font> S03<font color=#00FFFF>E19</font>

22
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:21,291
我跟你说 Pride
I'm telling you, Pride,

23
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:23,661
如果我想的是对的 那我就是错了
if I'm right about this, then I'm wrong.

24
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:25,295
不是说我自己错了
Well, not that-that I was wrong, per Se,

25
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:27,130
是之前的计算出了问题
but just that the initial calculations were incorrect.

26
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:28,966
但是因为那是FBI给的
But since those came from the FBI

27
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:30,700
-而不是我... -说人话
- and not me...- Rambling.

28
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:32,535
好吧 对不起
Right, sorry.

29
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:34,338
这是个正要面对的挑战
It's an ongoing challenge.

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,007
这几个星期里 我们来这儿很多次了
We've come out here many times in the last several weeks,

31
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,376
但目前还没有任何发现 能帮我们找出
and have yet to find anything to help us figure out

32
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:40,978
-杀害Javier Garcia的凶手 -好吧
- who killed Javier Garcia. - Okay, right.

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,213
那我们只能回到计算的问题
Well, that-that brings us back to the calculations.

34
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:45,215
我们的行动一直是基于
So, we've been operating under the belief

35
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:47,350
我们认为汽车炸弹雷管的向上推力
that the upward thrust of the car bomb's detonator

36
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:49,920
使弹片散落在一个同心圆弧里 对吧
sent the shrapnel out in a concentric arc, right?

37
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:50,376
是啊
Yeah?

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,022
但如果FBI没有考虑到
But what if the FBI never accounted

39
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:54,524
横向分散呢
for a-a lateral dispersion?

40
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:57,594
那爆炸区会更加不匀称
Well, then the blast zone would've been more asymmetrical?

41
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:58,828
完全正确
Exactly.

42
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,097
弹片会以完全不同的
Which would've sent the shrapnel out

43
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,365
轨迹散出去
in a whole different trajectory.

44
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,400
现在 如果我的推算是正确的
Now, if <i>my</i> calculations are right,

45
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,270
我们可能会找到些东西
we might be able to find something...

46
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:09,471
就在
...right around...

47
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:12,408
那儿
...there.

48
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,617
或者没有
Or not.

49
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,095
如果是 这样的东西呢
How about... something like this?

50
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,232
哦 对
Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:39,000
融化的金属
Melted metal,

52
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:40,635
向外隆起 对 没错
outward protuberance, yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:43,071
这可能是雷管上的
This-this could be from the detonator.

54
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:45,140
Pride 这可能就是我们一直在找的罪证
Pride, this might be the smoking gun we've been looking for.

55
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:48,643
但是烧得很焦了 应该在这儿很长时间了
Pretty charred though; been out here a long time.

56
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:50,778
你还能找到痕迹证据吗
Still think you can get trace evidence?

57
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,879
可以 相信我
Oh, yeah, believe me,

58
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,213
如果我能找到任何东西
if I can find anything

59
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,250
将Hamilton市长和Garcia的谋杀案联系起来 我会找到
to link Mayor Hamilton to Garcia's murder, I will.

60
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:58,218
我知道这对你的意义有多重大
I know how much this means to you.

61
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,987
谢谢
Thanks.

62
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:04,124
我们得暂时把这事搁在一边了
Well, we're gonna have to backburner it for now.

63
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,192
我们得工作了
We got to work.

64
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:07,261
在Belle Chasse有一名海军死了
Dead petty officer in Belle Chasse.

65
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:07,261
{\a6}Belle Chasse海军基地

66
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:08,763
我们走吧
Let's go.

67
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,471
有什么发现 Christopher
<i>What do we know, Christopher?</i>

68
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:19,206
Robert Campbell军士
Petty Officer Robert Campbell,

69
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,575
Gulfport市的建筑支队的一员
a member of a construction detachment out of Gulfport,

70
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,678
从五层楼高的地方掉下来 原因不明
took a dive from five stories up for reasons unknown.

71
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,912
他自杀的吗
As in, he killed himself?

72
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,280
这就是我们来这儿要找的答案
That's what we're here to find out.

73
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,082
那是Campbell的主管
That was Campbell's officer in charge.

74
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,650
他说在Campbell跳下去之前
He said before Campbell jumped,

75
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,018
他说过他头很疼
he talked about a pain in his head,

76
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,687
疼得不能忍受
that he couldn't take it.

77
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,789
好的 有吸毒史或者
Okay. Any history of drug abuse,

78
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,290
心理问题吗
psychological issues?

79
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:39,325
心理评估正常 药检没问题
Well, psych eval's normal, drug tests clean.

80
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,895
我没有发现任何异常的指标
Nothing I can see here that would raise any red flags.

81
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:43,863
我询问了他团队里的几乎每一个人
I questioned nearly every man in his unit;

82
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,764
他们都说Campbell充满活力
they all said Campbell was full of life,

83
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:47,867
完全想不到他会这么做
the last guy they'd expect that from.

84
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:50,103
一个人不会无缘无故跳楼
A man doesn't just jump for no reason.

85
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,106
有些东西把他逼到了边缘
Something drove him over the edge.

86
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,274
得弄清楚 Loretta
Need to know what. Loretta.

87
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,775
从严重的头部外伤
Well, judging from the massive head trauma

88
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:58,844
以及耳朵 鼻子 嘴巴里溢出的血来推断
and the hemorrhaging from the ears, nose and mouth...

89
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:02,047
毫无疑问 Campbell死于
...there's no doubt Campbell died

90
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:03,549
坠落的冲力
from the impact of the fall.

91
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,051
他在跳楼之前 曾抱怨说头疼
He complained of head pain just before he jumped.

92
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,320
有迹象表明头疼的原因吗
Any indication of what caused it?

93
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:10,556
我需要解剖尸体才知道
I'd have to get him into autopsy,

94
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:13,492
但有件事很奇怪
but there was one thing peculiar.

95
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,461
他的眼睛有黄疸
His eyes are jaundiced.

96
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:18,296
并不是坠落造成的
That didn't happen from the fall.

97
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,100
但有可能是先前就有的疾病造成的
But some pre-existing condition could've made that happen.

98
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:23,868
胆结石 胆汁梗阻
Yeah, gallstones, bile obstructions.

99
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,203
我想便秘是不会
Something tells me constipation

100
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:26,804
把他推下平台的
isn't what pushed him over the ledge.

101
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,407
Pride探员
Agent Pride?

102
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:30,308
我是Lopez少校
Lieutenant Commander Lopez.

103
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,876
很抱歉我没在这里迎接你
I'm sorry I wasn't here to greet you.

104
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:33,244
我得跟基地的指挥官报告情况
I had to update the base C.O.

105
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:34,412
少校
Commander.

106
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:36,014
Campbell军士是你的手下吗
P.O. Campbell's one of yours?

107
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:39,183
我一直在这儿监督海军工兵的工作
I've been overseeing the Seabees' work here,

108
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:41,118
军队里最优秀的40名士兵
40 of the finest men in uniform.

109
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,589
对于你的损失我很抱歉
I'm sorry for your loss.

110
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,591
知道为什么Campbell会这样吗
Any idea why Campbell might've done this?

111
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:48,325
不 不知道
No, none.

112
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,994
他一直很准时 一直在工作 非常努力
He's been on time and on task, and working his tail off

113
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:53,030
与其他人一起完成安装工作
with the rest of my men to complete the install.

114
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:56,033
你们正在安装的是什么
What is it that you're installing here?

115
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:58,035
高速光纤电缆
High-speed fiber optic cable.

116
00:04:58,037 --> 00:04:59,736
给整栋建筑物架线
Wiring the entire building.

117
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:03,140
把这些人从Gulfport市送到这里 只是为了架线吗
Travel these men down from Gulfport just to lay some cable?

118
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:05,609
基地最新的信息技术大楼
The base's newest I.T. building.

119
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:07,044
出于各种原因
Getting it online

120
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:09,446
上网都是最重要的
is paramount for a variety of reasons.

121
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:13,283
你介意我去看看其余的人吗
Do you mind if I go check up on the rest of my men?

122
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:14,718
他们被吓得不轻
They're pretty shaken.

123
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,886
没问题
Course.

124
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:24,860
有什么不对劲吗
Something wrong?

125
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:26,896
没有 只是
No, just...

126
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:29,665
带一个分队过来
seems strange to bring down a detachment unit

127
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,469
只为了安装光缆 这挺奇怪的
just to install fiber optic cable.

128
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,237
这是一次非常专业的安装
Well, it is a pretty specialized install.

129
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,838
嘿 来看看这个
Hey, check this out.

130
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,007
我刚大概看了一下Campbell团队的情况
I just did a quick rundown on Campbell's unit.

131
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,475
看起来他不是唯一一个
Looks like he wasn't the only one

132
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:40,542
不舒服的
not feeling well.

133
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:41,777
Bryan Howard军士
All right, Petty Officer Bryan Howard

134
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,813
昨晚登记入住了
apparently checked himself into

135
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:44,981
基地的诊所
the base clinic last night,

136
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:46,916
他现在生病待在营房里
and he is now sick in quarters.

137
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:49,284
感觉那个少校应该要提到这点
You'd think the commander would've mentioned that.

138
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:52,421
Sebstian 等Wade准备好了
Sebastian, go with Wade back to the morgue,

139
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:53,422
就跟她一起回停尸房
when she's ready.

140
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:55,124
你们一旦查明
Let me know as soon as you find out

141
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:57,259
折磨Campbell的病因 就马上告诉我
what Campbell might've been suffering from.

142
00:05:57,261 --> 00:06:00,862
在这期间 我们去见见Howard军士
Meanwhile, we'll go pay Petty Officer Howard a visit.

143
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,938
我半夜醒来
I woke up in the middle of the night,

144
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,241
脑袋发胀 就好像要爆炸一样
felt this pressure, like my head was gonna burst.

145
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:15,476
按道理不应该这样
Thoughts weren't making any sense.

146
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:17,245
当时真的生不如死
It was scary as hell, man.

147
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:19,547
所以你去门诊部做了检查吗
So you checked yourself into the clinic?

148
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:22,350
医生说我有脱水症
Doc said I had dehydration sickness.

149
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:25,687
给我输了液 开了镇静剂 就让我回去了
Gave me some fluids, sedatives, sent me on my way.

150
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,855
整整一周 你都和Campbell一起在那个脚手架上
Well, you were up on that scaffolding with Campbell

151
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:30,625
在阳光下暴晒 干你们的那些活 是吗
all week, exposed to the sun, working your butt off, right?

152
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:31,859
是的
That's right.

153
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,161
所以 脱水症 中暑
So, dehydration, heat stroke--

154
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,662
或许这才是原因所在
maybe that's what this is.

155
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,034
如果真是那样 他应该会有所好转 而不会更糟
If that's all this is, he should be getting better, not worse.

156
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,804
能否让我看一下
You mind?

157
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:48,542
他的眼睛有黄疸症 跟Campbell的一样
His eyes are jaundiced, just like Campbell's.

158
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:50,410
哇 你是说
Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you saying

159
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:52,245
我现在得了让Robert跳楼的病吗
whatever I've got's what made Robert jump?

160
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:54,715
不 我们并没有下任何结论 士兵
No, we're not saying anything, sailor.

161
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:58,118
我们只是想弄清楚发生了什么
We're just trying to figure out what happened.

162
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,387
所以 你半夜醒过来
So, you woke up in the middle of the night,

163
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:01,421
很难受
sick.

164
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,122
知道原因吗
Any idea what caused it?

165
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,691
我不知道
I don't know.

166
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:06,526
Campbell什么时候开始有这些症状的
When did Campbell start showing symptoms?

167
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:08,228
-大概是相同的时间吗 -是 差不多
- Around the same time? - Yeah, about.

168
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,497
但他只是上床休息
But he just went back to bed.

169
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,299
Campbell强壮得很 你知道吗
Look, Campbell was a beast, okay?

170
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,668
就算他挨了枪子 他也能回去继续工作
He probably could've taken a bullet and gone back to work.

171
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,868
还有其他人生病吗
Anybody else get sick?

172
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,070
我是说 这里肯定有什么问题
I mean, something's going around.

173
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:18,370
你跟别人分过食物或喝的吗
You share any food or drink?

174
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,573
没有 不过
No. Although...

175
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:24,043
不过什么
Although what?

176
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,679
我们收到过一个国王蛋糕
We had a king cake delivered to us.

177
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:27,847
我们都吃了一些
We all had some.

178
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,215
谁寄给你们的
Delivered by who?

179
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:32,418
纸条上只是写着 "欢迎来到Belle Chasse基地"
The note just said, “Welcome to Belle Chasse.”

180
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:34,553
我们并没有吃完蛋糕
We didn't eat all of it.

181
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:38,090
我觉得Robert把剩下的藏在他的箱子里了
I think Robert stashed the rest in his foot locker.

182
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,699
Angelo Brocato的蛋糕
Angelo Brocato's cakes.

183
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,699
成立于1905的新奥尔良品牌，被视为当地慈善机构，经历Katrina飓风后，被洪水冲毁

184
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,435
哇
Whoa.

185
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,536
King
King,

186
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,971
看看这个
take a look at this.

187
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,507
眼睛出血 口吐白沫
Blood in the eyes, foam in the mouth.

188
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,044
不可能只是食物中毒这么简单吧
No way that's just from food poisoning, right?

189
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,413
不可能
No way.

190
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:20,954
知道我们遇到的是什么毒吗
Any idea what kind of poison we might be dealing with here?

191
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,220
我把常见的毒物都测试了一遍
I've tested all the usual suspects--

192
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:26,790
氰化物 砷 士的宁 结果都是阴性
cyanide, arsenic, strychnine-- they all came back negative.

193
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:30,093
是 我还测试了蓖麻毒素 沙林 还有毒箭蛙
Yeah, and I checked for ricin, sarin and poison arrow frog.

194
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:31,027
也不匹配
No match.

195
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,596
但可以肯定的是 某种毒药
Still, some type of poison

196
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:34,998
使Campbell士官的细胞发生异变
mutated Petty Officer Campbell's cells,

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,566
造成了严重的脑肿胀
caused severe brain swelling.

198
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:39,102
这就解释了是什么逼他跳下去的
That explains what drove him off the ledge.

199
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:41,104
你知道 河豚毒素可以造成细胞突变
You know, tetrodotoxin could've caused cell mutation,

200
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,473
但是它 它比杀害Campbell的毒药反应要快
but it... it's faster acting than what killed Campbell.

201
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:44,874
你有检查钋吗
Have you checked for polonium?

202
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:46,109
嘿
Hey.

203
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:49,112
为什么你们没有一起工作
Why aren't the two of you working side by side?

204
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:51,814
Sebastian有点疑病症
Sebastian's a bit of a hypochondriac.

205
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:54,550
或者说 有些人只是更谨慎一些
Or, you know, some people might just say extra careful.

206
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:56,419
你知道的 我对毒药有点害怕
You know. I-I have a thing about poisons.

207
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:58,321
就像有些人怕蛇
It's like how some people are

208
00:08:58,323 --> 00:09:02,190
怕蜘蛛 怕马戏团的小丑
afraid of snakes or spiders or.. circus clowns, you know.

209
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,160
Campbell所在队伍的另外四名工兵
Four more Seabees from Campbell's unit were just

210
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:06,461
刚刚去看了门诊
admitted into a clinic,

211
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,664
而且Howard士官的病情更严重了
and Petty Officer Howard is getting sicker.

212
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,965
基地指挥官将他们都隔离了
The base C.O. is isolating them

213
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,433
直到查明病因
until they know what's causing it.

214
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:13,135
很奇怪的是 这个毒药对每个人的影响
It's odd that it's affecting people

215
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,270
都非常不一样
at vastly different rates.

216
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:16,705
毒药一般并不是这样的
Poisons don't usually work that way.

217
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:19,041
所以我们需要在病人死亡之前
Then we need to find out what does

218
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:20,375
找到答案
before we lose anyone else.

219
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:22,477
Sebastian 和Loretta一起
Sebastian, work <i>with</i> Loretta,

220
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,878
并肩作战 寻找线索
side by side, and learn things.

221
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,047
好吧 但是...
Okay, but the...

222
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:28,116
我们需要知道是谁订了那个蛋糕 Patton
Need to know who ordered that cake, Patton.

223
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:30,085
我希望我能告诉你 但是
And I wish I can tell you, but I can't

224
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,719
我从蛋糕店的电话记录中查不到任何人
get anybody from the bakery on the phone.

225
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,321
这个时间 很奇怪
This time of day, that's strange.

226
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,389
是的 但是我跟基地核查过了 根据
Yeah, but I did check with the base, and according to

227
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,959
他们的进门记录 Angelo Brocato确实在晚上九点的时候
their gate log, Angelo Brocato did, in fact, deliver a cake

228
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:40,662
-送了一份蛋糕 -地址上是寄给谁
- at 21:00 hours. - Addressed to who?

229
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,864
没有具体的名字 只写了53号兵营
No name in particular, just Barracks 53.

230
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,033
Campbell的部门 看来他们就是目标
Campbell's unit. Sounds like they were targeted.

231
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,268
为什么 一群在架线的工兵
Why? Bunch of Seabees installing cables.

232
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,003
可能不是
Yeah, maybe not.

233
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,538
Christopher Gregorio 你们去Angelo Brocato's
Christopher, Gregorio, go to Angelo Brocato's.

234
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
我要知道是谁订了那个蛋糕
I want to know who sent that cake.

235
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,708
Patton 检索在蛋糕店附近的
Patton, search surveillance cameras

236
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,343
摄像头录像
around the bakery,

237
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,446
把昨天进出过蛋糕店的所有人的身份都查出来
I.D. everyone who came in and out of there yesterday.

238
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:00,448
-明白 -你在给谁打电话
- Copy that. - Who you calling?

239
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,283
Belle Chasse基地 请找Lopez少校
Belle Chasse. Commander Lopez, please.

240
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:04,651
我想知道这些工兵到底在做什么
I want to know what those Seabees were really doing.

241
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:07,220
告诉她 我是NCIS探员Pride
Tell her it's Agent Pride, NCIS.

242
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,733
打扰一下
Excuse me.

243
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,201
联邦探员 你在这儿上班吗
Federal agents. You work here?

244
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,368
嗯 是的
Um, yeah.

245
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,769
怎么了 有什么事吗
Why? Is there something wrong?

246
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:26,005
蛋糕店通常在这个点还关着门吗
The bakery usually closed at this hour?

247
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,340
不是
No.

248
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:29,175
应该是几个小时前就开的
Should've been open hours ago.

249
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:30,910
我刚到这儿 准备上下午的班
I mean, I just got here for my afternoon shift.

250
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:32,979
我不知道为什么我的老板没有给我打电话
I don't know why my boss didn't call me.

251
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:35,982
老实说 我有点担心
Honestly, I'm a little worried.

252
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,001
门是开着的
Door's open.

253
00:11:17,758 --> 00:11:21,826
哦 不 黄疸症的眼睛和口吐白沫
Oh, no. Jaundiced eyes and foaming at the mouth.

254
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,996
和工兵们一样的症状
Same symptoms as the Seabees.

255
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:26,698
是吃了同一个蛋糕吗
From sampling the same cake?

256
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,232
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

257
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,768
他的胳膊和手上有防御伤
He's got defensive wounds on his arms and hands.

258
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,303
看来他跟人搏斗过
Looks like he put up a fight.

259
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:33,771
最后输了
And lost.

260
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:37,941
这个世界到底怎么了
What in the world is going on here?

261
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,914
从我记事儿以来 Richard Logan就一直
Richard Logan's been working at Angelo Brocato's

262
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,983
在Angelo Brocato's工作
for as long as I can remember.

263
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:47,985
没错 也是他们最好的糕点师
Yeah, best pastry chef they've got, too.

264
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:50,020
人们会点名要订他的国王蛋糕
Folks order his king cakes by name.

265
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:52,522
他给工兵的蛋糕下毒只可能是...
Only way he would've poisoned the Seabees' cake...

266
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:54,925
他是被人强迫这样做的
Is if he was forced into doing it.

267
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:56,827
医生说凶手敲晕了Logan
Doc says the killer knocked out Logan

268
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,762
并且一定给他注射了
and must have injected him

269
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,664
与杀害工兵的相同毒药
with the same poison that killed our Seabee.

270
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,965
她得出死亡时间了吗
She got time of death?

271
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:03,733
是 昨晚九点到十点之间
Yes. Between 9:00 and 10:00 last night,

272
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:05,569
根据Patton的发现 与蛋糕被送到基地
which, according to Patton, is the same time

273
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,304
是在同一时间
the cake was delivered to the base.

274
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:10,473
所以凶手等到顾客都离开了
So killer waits for customers to leave,

275
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,609
强迫蛋糕师给蛋糕下毒
forces the baker to poison the cake,

276
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:15,178
然后就等着 直到蛋糕被送到再杀了他 为什么
and then waits... until it's delivered to kill him? Why?

277
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,646
凶手可能不希望
Killer probably didn't want

278
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:19,215
Logan认出他 想要掩饰他的行踪
Logan to I.D. him-- tried to cover his tracks.

279
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:21,450
是 但却把Logan的尸体留给我们去研究
Yeah, but by leaving Logan's body for us to find,

280
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:22,852
什么都有可能 除了
it does anything but.

281
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:24,020
粗心
Sloppy.

282
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:25,621
-这说不通啊 -是的
- It doesn't make sense. - Yeah.

283
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:27,156
不过 你觉得这些工兵是目标吗
Still, you think our Seabees were targeted?

284
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:28,758
没有理由不是
No reason not to.

285
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,360
尤其是 我联系不到Lopez少校
Especially since I can't get in contact with Commander Lopez.

286
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:32,929
甚至问过她在Gulfport市的
Even checked with her C.O.

287
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:35,198
-指挥官 -你觉得她失踪了吗
- at Gulfport. - Think she went U.A.?

288
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,832
在Belle Chasse基地的指挥官
The base C.O. at Belle Chasse checked

289
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,367
检查了外出记录 说她在我们今早离开后
the exit logs; says that she left

290
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:40,168
就立马离开了
right after we did this morning.

291
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,804
等等 我们现在是把她当嫌疑人了吗
So, wait, are we thinking she's a suspect now?

292
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:44,640
只有找到她才能知道
Well, only way to know is to find her.

293
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:46,108
哈 领先你们一步
Ah. One step ahead of y'all.

294
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,576
看看这个
Check it out.

295
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,411
我刚才在排查蛋糕店周围的
I was combing through surveillance footage

296
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:51,113
监控录像
around the bakery.

297
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:53,148
没有发现可疑的顾客
Not a suspicious customer in sight,

298
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,651
直到 我决定扩大搜索范围
until... I decided to expand my search window.

299
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,386
看
Voila.

300
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:01,089
Lopez少校
Commander Lopez.

301
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:02,523
Lopez 她去那儿做什么
Lopez? What is she doing there?

302
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:03,691
这是什么时候的录像
When was this taken?

303
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:04,860
大概一个半小时前
About a hour and a half ago.

304
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:06,762
就在Tammy和我到那儿之前
That's right before Tammy and I got there.

305
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:08,163
会不会是我们把她赶走了
Think we chased her away?

306
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:10,598
但还是不知道 她一开始去那儿做什么
Well, still, what was she doing there in the first place?

307
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,768
尤其是 面包师已经死了好几个小时
Especially considering the baker had been dead for hours.

308
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,104
太多事情串不起来 而现在没人跟我们解释
Yeah, too many things don't add up, and no one's talking to us.

309
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:19,039
我一会给Vance主任打电话
I'll call Director Vance.

310
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,309
看他能不能跳过这些官僚程序
See if he can cut through this bureaucracy.

311
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:22,943
伙计们 我们有大麻烦了
Guys, we got big problems.

312
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:24,646
对 恐怕非常不乐观 Dwayne
Yeah, I'm afraid it's not good, Dwayne.

313
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,013
不 这比不乐观糟糕多了
No, it's worse than not good.

314
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,649
实验结果证明 蛋糕不是被下毒了
It turns out that the cake wasn't spiked with a poison,

315
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:30,017
而是被注入一种病毒
it was injected with a virus.

316
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,219
当我无法识别是什么毒时 我重新检测了一遍
When I couldn't identify the poison, I rechecked

317
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:34,054
被感染的细胞分子结构
the molecular structure of the affected cells...

318
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,490
然后发现它其实是
And discovered that it was actually infested

319
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:38,225
被极小的
with microscopic,

320
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,294
单链RNA感染了
single-strand RNAs.

321
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:41,361
也就是病毒
Which means virus?

322
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,596
对 但不是一般的病毒
Yeah, but not just any virus.

323
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:44,531
而是一种超级病毒 就像是
A supervirus-- we're talking

324
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,434
刚果出血热 登革热 埃博拉病毒
Congolese hemorrhagic fever, dengue, Ebola

325
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:48,368
加在一起那么厉害
all rolled into one.

326
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,369
他是传染性的吗
Is it contagious?

327
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,038
传染性极强 但幸运的是 不是空气传播
Very. But fortunately not airborne.

328
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,774
是的 唯一感染途径是
Right. The only way to contract it is

329
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:55,342
吸收 就像吃国王蛋糕这样
either through ingestion, like with the king cake,

330
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:57,511
或者接触 与感染者的任何皮肤接触
or by touch, so any skin-to-skin contact

331
00:13:57,513 --> 00:13:59,512
都有传染风险
with the infected can risk exposure.

332
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,314
这也就包括了 任何接触过工兵
Means anyone who's been around our Seabees

333
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:02,982
或者蛋糕的人
or the cake could get it.

334
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:04,417
整个基地都有危险
The whole base could be in danger.

335
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:05,685
我们也是
So could we.

336
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:08,154
虽然我们之中还没人出现症状
Except none of us have shown any symptoms yet.

337
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,722
但我们也不能冒险
Still no reason to take chances.

338
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,158
我们得待在办公室 直到我们都做完检测
We stay put in the office till we all get tested.

339
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,026
有治愈的办法吗
Is there a cure?

340
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:14,294
据我所知 还没有
Not that I know of.

341
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:15,628
King
King.

342
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,163
这可能不只是针对工兵的袭击
This could be more than just an attack on our Seabees.

343
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:19,799
这可能是生物恐怖袭击
Could be bioterrorism.

344
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:23,536
给基地指挥官打电话
Get the base C.O. on the phone.

345
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:25,103
我们需要封锁Belle Chasse基地
We're gonna lock down Belle Chasse.

346
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:26,839
我们不能让病毒传播
We cannot let this get out.

347
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,006
Dwayne
Dwayne.

348
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:32,477
恐怕已经传播出来了
I'm afraid it already has.

349
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:02,471
Wade医生
Dr. Wade?

350
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:04,472
哦 拜托 我们在浪费宝贵的时间
Oh, please, we're wasting valuable time.

351
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,274
-就让我工作吧 -好的 女士
- Let me just work. - Yes, ma'am.

352
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:09,510
Loretta
Loretta!

353
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,580
Loretta
Loretta.

354
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:16,117
告诉我 Loretta 怎么回事
Talk to me, Loretta. How did this happen?

355
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:17,886
我一定是在
It must have happened

356
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:19,054
犯罪现场感染的
at the crime scene.

357
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:22,123
没穿消毒服 我的皮肤外露
Without my scrub suit on, my skin was exposed.

358
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,424
然后你接触Campbell的尸体了
And you handled Campbell's body?

359
00:15:23,426 --> 00:15:28,028
对 血液微粒 唾液 汗液
Yeah. Blood particulates, saliva, sweat.

360
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,298
不需要很多就会感染
Doesn't take much.

361
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:33,934
我想你和你的小队应该没事
I assume you and your team are all right.

362
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,470
对 我们的检测结果都是阴性的
Yeah, we-we all tested negative.

363
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:37,237
谢天谢地
Ah, thank God for that.

364
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,039
Sebastian也没事
Sebastian cleared, too.

365
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:43,043
下次 记得提醒我不要嘲笑
Next time, remind me not to tease him

366
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:45,746
他老是疑神疑鬼的 那没准能救命
about being a hypochondriac-- it may have saved his life.

367
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:52,786
你不应该休息吗 Loretta
Should you rest, Loretta?

368
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:54,254
没有时间休息了
There's no time to rest,

369
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:56,089
尤其是现在还有其他感染者
not with others being infected, too,

370
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:57,557
如果我们不能阻止病毒扩散
and more to come

371
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,560
还将有更多的感染者
if we can't stop this virus from spreading.

372
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:03,497
Belle Chasse基地的情况怎么样
The situation at Belle Chasse?

373
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:06,433
基地已经封锁 感染的人已经隔离
Base is locked down, the sick quarantined.

374
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:08,935
海洋化学和生物事件响应部队
Marine Chemical and Biological Incident Response Force

375
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:10,637
已经在路上了
is on its way.

376
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,772
目前为止有多少感染者
How many infected so far?

377
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,207
一共七个 四个是Campbell的工兵同事
Seven total-- four of Campbell's Seabees,

378
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,044
三个是和他们同一营房的机械师
three machinists who shared the barracks with them.

379
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,379
烧掉他们的衣服和所有物品
Burn their clothing, all their belongings.

380
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:22,148
虽然不通过空气传播
It's not airborne,

381
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,417
但显然有极高的传染性
but obviously it's highly contagious.

382
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:29,155
并且致命 如果我们找不到治愈的办法
Deadly, if we can't find the cure.

383
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,623
我们还有多长时间
How much time do we have?

384
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,959
你是说我还剩多长时间吗
You mean how much time do <i>I</i> have?

385
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,894
这个么
Well...

386
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:39,231
病毒对每个人的影响不一样
the virus affects everybody differently.

387
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:42,868
但我在工作的同时一直在监测我体内的病毒
But I am monitoring my viral load while I work,

388
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,039
看它使我全部白细胞变异要多久
see how quickly it mutates my white blood cells.

389
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,341
我估计大概
I would say maybe...

390
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,611
10个 11个小时就会...
ten, 11 hours before...

391
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,952
我不敢相信这会发生
I can't believe that this is happening.

392
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,954
她现在怎么样了
How's she doing?

393
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,956
害怕 就和我们一样
Scared, like the rest of us.

394
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,892
她就靠我们了 Sebastian
She's counting on us, Sebastian.

395
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:11,028
集中注意力 为了所有人
Stay focused, for everybody's sake.

396
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,030
说起来容易 做起来难
Yeah, easier said than done.

397
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,501
病毒库有匹配结果了
Got a match from the viral database.

398
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,737
-QR6 -那是什么
- QR6. - What is that?

399
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,139
那是由中国军队研究出来的超级病毒
It's a-a supervirus developed by the Chinese military,

400
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,775
但正常来讲 不可能从他们的实验室泄露出来
but supposedly, it never left their lab.

401
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,078
Pride 如果是这个 那这就是一次生物恐怖袭击
Pride, if this is right, then this has to be bioterrorism.

402
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,946
这是毫无疑问的
I mean, there's no two ways about it.

403
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,280
但为什么是现在 为什么选Belle Chasse基地
But why now? Why Belle Chasse?

404
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,548
我不知道
I don't know.

405
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,050
唯一的好消息是他们不可能
I mean, the only good news is that there's no way

406
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:36,119
研究出这么致命的病毒
they would have developed this lethal a bug

407
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,721
而不研究解毒剂
without also developing an antidote.

408
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,656
所以就算Loretta研究不出解药
So even if Loretta can't come up with a cure...

409
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,425
对 我们可以 只要我们能找到
Yeah, then we can, as long as we can

410
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,693
给国王蛋糕下毒的人
find whoever infected that king cake.

411
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,294
因为他们没有被感染
'Cause they'll probably have the antidote,

412
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,029
所以他们很有可能有解药
since they don't want to get infected, too.

413
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,897
唯一的问题就是 我们没有那么多时间
Only problem is we don't have that much time.

414
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,432
好吧 你待在这 帮Loretta
All right, stay here, help Loretta.

415
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:50,911
等等 你等一下 你得带我去基地
Wait, hold on, you got to get me on that base.

416
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:51,501
什么
What?

417
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:53,269
受害者被感染的程度不一样 对吧
Victims are being infected at different rates, right?

418
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,205
也就是说 有一些人比其他人对病毒更有抵抗力
Which means some are more resistant to the virus than others.

419
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,975
如果我能检测他们的血液 也许我能研究出解药
If I can test their blood, then maybe I can create my own cure.

420
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,910
我 我不能让你也冒着被感染的风险
I'm-I'm not willing to risk you getting sick, too...

421
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:02,411
这不是你的选择
That's not your choice!

422
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:06,982
求你了 Pride
Please, Pride.

423
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:08,384
我 我知道你想要
I-I know that you want

424
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:10,286
尽你所能去救Loretta
to do everything you can to save Loretta,

425
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,654
但我也是 好吗
but so do I, all right?

426
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:13,956
我不能 失去她
I-I can't lose her.

427
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:21,564
我们不会失去她的 Sebastian
We're not gonna lose her, Sebastian.

428
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:28,603
我会安排你和海洋生物响应部队一起
I'll get you on with the Marine Bio Response Force.

429
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:31,073
你和他们合作 但听我说
You work with them, but listen to me--

430
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,474
生化防护衣
Hazmat suit,

431
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,109
手腕带 所有的防护
wrist tape, the works.

432
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,979
我一样不能失去你
I can't lose <i>you,</i> either.

433
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,752
哦 等等 Pride
Oh, wait. Pride.

434
00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:44,952
Pride
Pride.

435
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:46,821
我差点忘了 呃
I almost forgot. Uh...

436
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:48,690
我从那个 Garcia的弹片上
I was able to get a partial fingerprint

437
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,091
得到了一个局部的指纹
off of that, uh, Garcia shrapnel.

438
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:51,660
不足以确认身份
It's not enough for an I.D.,

439
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,495
而且显然不可能将炸弹
and obviously it's no way to tie the bombing

440
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:55,963
和Hamilton市长联系起来 但这是个开始
to Mayor Hamilton, but it's a start.

441
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:57,932
好 你为什么现在告诉我
Okay, wh-why are you showing me this now?

442
00:18:57,934 --> 00:19:00,835
就是 万一我出了什么事
Just, you know, in case something happens to me.

443
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,175
我们以后再研究这个 Sebastian 我们一起
We'll work on this later, Sebastian, together.

444
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:10,344
集中注意力
Focus.

445
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:13,580
Pride探员
Agent Pride.

446
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:34,367
刚和海军情报办公室通过电话
Just got off the phone with the Office of Naval Intelligence.

447
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,769
他们终于承认Lopez少校和她的团队
Finally admitted that Commander Lopez and her team

448
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:38,905
在Belle Chasse安装的
were doing more than just

449
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:41,041
并不只是电缆
installing cable at Belle Chasse.

450
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:43,076
-还有别的 那是什么 -还不知道
- More, meaning what? - Don't know yet.

451
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:45,911
海军情报办需要许可才能告诉我们详情
ONI needs clearance to get us read in.

452
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:48,614
很明显 这是被归类为高级机密的
Apparently, it's top secret, compartmentalized.

453
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:50,450
他们想继续保密
They want to keep it that way

454
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:52,151
直到他们掌握了更多内容
until they can get more specifics

455
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:54,253
关于中国人到底想要的是什么
about what the Chinese are really after.

456
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:56,288
瞄准了参与机密建设的工兵营
Targeting Seabees on a top secret project

457
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,957
这对他们来说还不够吗
not specific enough for them?

458
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,593
他们觉得 知道项目具体内容的人
The less people know exactly what the project is,

459
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:03,528
越少越好
the better, far as they're concerned.

460
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,766
海军情报办想要我们专心去抓该为此事负责的人
ONI just wants us focusing on catching whoever's responsible.

461
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:10,035
Lopez少校呢 他们找到她了吗
What about Commander Lopez? Did they hear from her?

462
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:11,937
没 所以他们有些担心
No. And they're worried.

463
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:14,673
事实上 是他们派她到蛋糕店
Turns out they're the ones who sent her to the bakery

464
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:16,308
暗中调查
to quietly investigate.

465
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,910
也许她从她手下那儿听说了国王蛋糕的事
Well, maybe she heard about the king cake from her men.

466
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:20,979
至少解释了她为什么在那儿
At least that explains why she was there.

467
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:22,280
没错 但不能解释她为什么消失了
Yeah, but not why she disappeared.

468
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:23,782
监视名单上有什么发现
You find anything on the watch list?

469
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,985
这是一个跟国家安全部有关的中国人名单
Yeah, a list of Chinese nationals linked to MSS,

470
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,187
但是得花我们一周才能缩小范围
but it'll take us all week to narrow it down.

471
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:30,389
Loretta可撑不到一周
Loretta doesn't have all week

472
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:32,156
其他感染者也撑不了这么久
and neither do the other victims.

473
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:34,792
我们得另找办法来查出做这事的人 得快
We need another way to find out who did this, fast.

474
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:36,660
我这儿可能有所发现
Might have something in here.

475
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:38,496
我一直在查谋杀发生时
Been I.D.-ing every person and car

476
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,331
每个进了Angelo Brocato's的人
in or around Angelo Brocato's

477
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,233
以及在附近逗留的人和车
around the time of the baker's murder.

478
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:44,168
什么都没看到 直到...
Nothing came up until...

479
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,505
我们发现一辆驶过的银色丰田四驱车的车牌
We matched the license plate to a silver Toyota 4Runner

480
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,207
和两天前上报失窃的车牌匹配上了
reported stolen two days ago driving by.

481
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,741
晚上9:33
9:33 p.m.

482
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:52,309
可能是个巧合 或者
Could be a coincidence, or...

483
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:54,044
可能是我们要找的特工 干得好
Could be our operatives. Good work.

484
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,147
我会发布一个协查通告 同时通知州警和FBI
I'll put a BOLO out, notify LSP and FBI, too.

485
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:58,882
我们要不要触发紧急报警系统 扩大影响
Should we trigger EAS, go wide?

486
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,750
-我是说 这实在... -不 不 不
- I mean, it's just... - No, no, no, no, no.

487
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:02,819
媒体一旦抓住这个事 放出风去
The media gets ahold of this and puts it out there,

488
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,587
可能会引起恐慌
could cause a panic that the virus

489
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:06,323
以为病毒已经扩散到基地外
is gonna spread beyond the base.

490
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:09,526
这只会让我们更难找到那些特工
Make it all that more difficult to find our operatives.

491
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:11,060
卫生部门已经知道了
Well, the health department already knows.

492
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,796
他们对Wade的停尸房进行了病毒隔离
They quarantined Wade's morgue.

493
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:14,798
媒体发现这件事只是时间问题
It's just a matter of time before the media finds out.

494
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,399
对 随后就会引起公众恐慌
Yep, and stokes public fear.

495
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,902
我们必须控制住局势
We have to keep this contained.

496
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,139
只有一种办法能控制了
Only one way to do that.

497
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:27,910
你们找到车就立即告诉我
Let me know when you find that car.

498
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,578
他要去哪儿
Where's he going?

499
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,448
我敢说是他最不想去的地方
I bet it's the last place he wants to go.

500
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:39,088
你碰上硬茬了 Dwayne 我就跟你说这些
You got stones, Dwayne, I'll give you that much.

501
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,224
我俩都不希望媒体抓住这个新闻
Last thing we both need is for the media to get ahold of this.

502
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:44,693
他们已经和我办公室联系过了 还不止一次
They've already contacted my office, more than once.

503
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:48,229
媒体的歇斯底里对我找出幕后黑手毫无帮助
Media hysteria is not gonna help me find out who's responsible.

504
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:49,965
事实上 反而会增加难度
In fact, it'll hurt the cause.

505
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:54,402
我有线索了 只需要一两天 或许更快
I got a lead, just need a day or two, maybe less.

506
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:56,905
可是 我不是很擅长对民众撒谎
Still, I couldn't very well lie to the people.

507
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:59,074
如果我很善于撒谎 就不会成为好市长了 对吧
I wouldn't be a very good mayor if I did, now would I?

508
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:02,143
很明显 公共卫生办公室也打电话了
Apparently the Office of Public Health is getting calls, too.

509
00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:05,080
他们在寻求一份官方声明
They're asking for an official statement.

510
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:08,016
顺便问一句 Loretta如何了
And by the way, how's Loretta doing?

511
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,589
真够丢脸的 对吧
Real shame, isn't it?

512
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:17,024
你几个意思
So, what?

513
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:19,393
你是在针对我吗
You're gonna make this personal, is that it?

514
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:21,696
这事关阻止一场病毒爆发
This is about trying to stop an outbreak,

515
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:23,764
拯救无辜人员 这不是我们的私人恩怨 Hamilton
saving innocent people; this isn't about us, Hamilton.

516
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:25,199
去你的不是私人恩怨
The hell it's not about us.

517
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:28,135
Garcia事件后 我们的每件事都是私人恩怨
Everything's about us since Garcia.

518
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:30,037
你也许不这么看 Dwayne 但事实是
You may not see this, Dwayne, but the truth is

519
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,907
我们的目的是相同的 都是为了这个城市好
we both want the same thing: what's good for this city.

520
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:35,042
唯一的问题在于
The only problem is that you think

521
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:36,943
你认为扳倒我是达到目的的最好方法
that bringing me down is the best way to do that,

522
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:38,578
而我不能让这事发生
and I can't allow that to happen.

523
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,182
你想怎样
So what do you want?

524
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:45,352
我想要你手头所有关于我的证据
I want whatever you got on me.

525
00:22:45,354 --> 00:22:47,287
所有你认为的关于我的证据
Whatever you <i>think</i> you got.

526
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:48,622
当面 Garcia案的证据
Vis-à-vis Garcia.

527
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:49,990
听起来像是向我认罪了
Sounds like an admission to me.

528
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:51,190
我没承认任何事
Not admitting anything.

529
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:53,393
我只想让你离我远远的
I just want you off my back once and for all.

530
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:55,461
所以你为了掩饰自己的罪行
So you're threatening to impede my investigation,

531
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:58,865
不惜冒着扩散恐慌的危险来威胁我 妨碍我调查
risk causing widespread fear just to cover your own ass?

532
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,366
你才是一直在威胁别人的人
You're the one doing the threatening,

533
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:01,968
而我不打算继续容忍下去了
and I'm not gonna stand for it,

534
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,603
哪怕这意味着要把你
not anymore, even if it means getting you

535
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:05,639
和你的整个见鬼的团队踢出新奥尔良
and your whole damn team kicked out of New Orleans.

536
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:07,473
NCIS是联邦机构
NCIS is federal.

537
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:10,076
你没有权力和管辖权...
You don't have the power or the jurisdiction...

538
00:23:10,078 --> 00:23:11,911
哦 伙计 只要你有人脉
Oh, man, jurisdiction doesn't mean anything

539
00:23:11,913 --> 00:23:13,846
管辖权没有任何意义
if you got connections.

540
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:16,215
我跟国防部长是老交情了
And me and SECDEF go way back,

541
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:17,583
相信我
believe me.

542
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:20,119
很明显 有一种东西叫做
Apparently, there's something called

543
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:21,421
流动协议
a mobility agreement.

544
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:22,988
协议上说 如果海军高官认为
Says that if Navy brass thinks

545
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,290
NCIS和这座城市相处得不是很好
NCIS and the city aren't getting along,

546
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:28,160
他们能把你们重新派到天知道什么地方去
well, they can re-assign you to God knows where.

547
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:32,031
游戏结束了 Dwayne
Gloves are off, Dwayne.

548
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:33,966
你想要我帮忙吗
You want my help, hmm?

549
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:36,134
想要我合作 除非
Cooperation? That only happens

550
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:39,704
明天这个时间 你把你搞到的关于Garcia的一切都给我
you get me everything you got on Garcia by this time tomorrow.

551
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:41,540
明白了吗
Understand?

552
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,981
我们的协查通告没有回应
We didn't get a BOLO hit,

553
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:52,517
但是Patton一直在追踪这一片的
but Patton's been tracking satellite radio signals

554
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,052
所有四驱车的卫星无线信号
from every 4Runner in the area,

555
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:55,387
发现有一个突然消失了
when one suddenly vanished.

556
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:57,488
-我想我们发现它了 -Gregorio
- I think we just found it. - Gregorio.

557
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,190
-看这里 -是什么
- Look at this. - What is it?

558
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,293
我很确定这是Lopez
I'm pretty sure it's Lopez.

559
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:06,497
Lopez在里面 Pride
Lopez is inside, Pride.

560
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:08,332
她死了
She's dead.

561
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:10,434
一定有人发现她在调查了
Must've caught her investigating.

562
00:24:10,436 --> 00:24:12,436
后座上还有两个人
Two more in the backseat.

563
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:15,539
等等 还有两个
Wait. Two more?

564
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,041
他们是谁
Who are they?

565
00:24:18,043 --> 00:24:21,545
我刚通过受害者的DNA确定了他们的身份
I just got DNA I.D.s on both victims,

566
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:24,515
但我觉得你们不会喜欢的
but I'm afraid you're not gonna like this.

567
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:26,617
他们是陆战队员
They're marines.

568
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:28,785
我把档案发给你们
I'm sending the files to you now.

569
00:24:30,422 --> 00:24:32,956
Loretta 你必须休息了
Loretta, you have to lie down.

570
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,591
我们讨论过这个问题了 Dwayne
We've been through this, Dwayne.

571
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:37,694
我们都知道我不是唯一一个时日无多的人
We both know I'm not the only one running out of time.

572
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:41,297
等等 他们不只是一般的陆战队员
Wait a second, those aren't just any marines.

573
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,233
好吗 他们是赶往Belle Chasse的
All right? They're part of a Biological Response Force

574
00:24:43,235 --> 00:24:44,735
生化响应部队的队员
that was headed for Belle Chasse.

575
00:24:44,737 --> 00:24:46,469
等等 特工们杀了Lopez
Wait, operatives killed Lopez

576
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:48,471
是因为她在调查他们 这我能理解
because she was investigating them-- that much I get.

577
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:50,673
但是为什么截杀了另外两个人
But why intercept and kill the other two?

578
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:52,808
是不想让他们阻止病毒爆发吗
Try to keep them from stopping the outbreak?

579
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,677
等等 根据Belle Chasse的出入记录
Hold on. According to the Belle Chasse

580
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:57,013
Davis下士和Lin下士
entry log, Corporals Davis and Lin

581
00:24:57,015 --> 00:24:59,715
刚刚跟他们的部队一起进了大门
just checked in at the main gate along with their unit.

582
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:01,317
所以特工们一定潜伏在里面
So operatives must have snuck in,

583
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,752
在他们跟陆战护卫队一起出行的时候
killed them while they were traveling

584
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:04,319
杀掉了他们
with the marine convoy.

585
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:07,089
但是他们做这一切只是为了偷取他们的身份牌吗
But they did all that just to steal their I.D.s?

586
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,658
这说不通啊
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

587
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,393
我是说 基地里有人被感染
I mean, if they're with the people that infected the base,

588
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:12,962
那一定是他们最不想去的地方
that'd be the last place they'd want to go.

589
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:13,963
Dwayne
Dwayne.

590
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:15,464
我知道 我知道
I know, I know.

591
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:16,999
Sebastian正在Belle Chasse
Sebastian's at Belle Chasse

592
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,500
等候响应部队
waiting for the Response Force.

593
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:20,969
也就是说 他完全不知道这两个人的真实身份
Which means he has no idea who those people really are.

594
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,005
你们是响应部队的吗
<i>You guys from</i> <i>the Response Force?</i>

595
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:26,841
是 准下士Lin和Davis
Yeah. Lance Corporal Lin, Davis.

596
00:25:26,843 --> 00:25:28,544
其他人在路上
Rest of the team's on its way.

597
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:30,212
-你是谁 -海军罪案调查处 法医探员Lund.
- Who are you? - NCIS, Forensic Agent Lund.

598
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:32,181
我来这里调查事件发生的原因
I'm here to figure out how this all happened,

599
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:34,349
但更重要的是 阻止事件进一步恶化
but more importantly, how we can stop it.

600
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:35,817
跟我来 穿好装备
Come on, let's get geared up.

601
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:38,787
直接转到了语音信箱
Straight to voice mail.

602
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:39,921
我们必须去趟基地
We got to get to the base.

603
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,290
Christopher 继续打
Christopher, keep calling

604
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,125
Sebastian的电话
Sebastian on his cell.

605
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,326
我会通知海军情报局
I'll call ONI.

606
00:25:45,328 --> 00:25:46,360
Gregorio
Gregorio,

607
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:48,029
通知基地的警察
get the base police

608
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:49,297
守住Belle Chasse基地
to secure Belle Chasses,

609
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,265
严密控制各个大门
put the gates on high alert.

610
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:55,336
Loretta 一有消息马上告诉你 我保证
Loretta, I'll call you as soon as we know anything, promise.

611
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,710
嘿 Wade医生
Hey! Dr. Wade!

612
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:20,400
最近一次使用的抗生素也没有效果
Last antibiotic isn't working, either.

613
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:21,567
给我碳青霉烯 亚治疗抗生素疗法
Get me carbapenem, stat.

614
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:21,567
{\a6}sub-therapeutic antibiotic treatment

615
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:22,835
准备插管治疗
Let's intubate her.

616
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:25,504
来 来 快点 伙计
Come on, come on. Hurry up, people.

617
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:28,674
如果想救她 就得先让她稳定下来
If we want to save her, we've got to stabilize her.

618
00:26:28,676 --> 00:26:31,710
她还有意识吗 能说话吗
Is she conscious, talking?

619
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:33,512
好 你告诉她保重
All right, you tell her to take care

620
00:26:33,514 --> 00:26:35,748
我们这边会竭尽全力
and that we're out here doing everything we can on our end.

621
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,583
-谢谢 -Wade怎么样了
- Thank you. - How's Wade?

622
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:39,785
医生打算让她进入药物性昏迷状态
Thinking about putting her in a medically induced coma

623
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:41,853
延缓新陈代谢 争取更多时间
to slow her metabolism, buy time.

624
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:43,656
她还剩多长时间
How much time she have?

625
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:45,223
-不多了 -Pride探员
- Not much. - Agent Pride.

626
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:46,925
我是Rogers上校 基地指挥官
I'm Captain Rogers, Base Commanding Officer here.

627
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:48,694
找到我的探员了吗
Any luck finding my agent?

628
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:51,163
还没有 这个基地很大 我们还在搜索
Not yet, but it's a large base; we're still searching.

629
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,899
但基地已经全面戒严 每个出口都被控制
But we're under full lockdown, every access point guarded.

630
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:55,500
特工不可能从我们眼皮底下
Operatives won't be able to escape

631
00:26:55,502 --> 00:26:57,269
-逃跑 -好的 但要注意
- without going through us. - Okay, well, the problem is

632
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:58,703
我们必须活捉他们
we got to take them alive.

633
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:00,704
只有他们可能有解毒剂
They may be the only ones with an antidote.

634
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:02,039
还是没找到Sebastian King
Still can't reach Sebastian, King.

635
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,740
他为什么要关机呢
Why would he turn off his phone?

636
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:05,810
他不会的
He wouldn't.

637
00:27:05,812 --> 00:27:09,213
基地有什么区域会屏蔽手机信号吗
Is there a secure area on base where cell phones are jammed?

638
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:10,547
有 确实有
Yes, there is.

639
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:12,149
Downey中校 海军情报局
Commander Downey, Naval Intelligence.

640
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:13,650
-我们之前通过话 跟我来 -是 长官
- We spoke earlier. Follow me. -Yes, sir.

641
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:15,085
看来我们最终还是获得了权限
Looks like we finally got clearance.

642
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:16,753
希望如此 迟到总比不到好
Hopefully. Better late than never.

643
00:27:16,755 --> 00:27:19,289
我会在路上告诉你们情况 我有车
I'll download you on the way. I got a vehicle.

644
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:25,161
我还是不明白 我们来这儿做什么
I still don't know why we're here

645
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:26,863
我们为什么要穿防护服
or why we're wearing protective gear.

646
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:28,565
Campbell士官的血液微粒无处不在
P.O. Campbell's blood particulates could be anywhere.

647
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:29,966
对 可是这地方已经清理干净了
Yeah, but the area's already been cleared.

648
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:31,635
我们要做的是测试感染者
What we need to be doing is testing the infected

649
00:27:31,637 --> 00:27:33,336
获取有抵抗性的抗体
for resistant antibodies.

650
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:35,571
这是我们的管辖范围 Lund探员
This is our jurisdiction, Agent Lund,

651
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:37,773
不是你的
not yours.

652
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:41,010
-有问题吗 -没 没问题了
- There a problem? - No. Everything's good.

653
00:27:41,012 --> 00:27:42,745
好 检查外面的残留污染物
All right. Check for residual contamination

654
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,147
我们负责检查里面
out here, we'll check inside.

655
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:46,282
走
Let's go.

656
00:28:09,874 --> 00:28:11,874
麻烦了
Crap.

657
00:28:17,915 --> 00:28:21,016
我们认为 这次生物袭击只是为了转移我们的注意力
We think the biological attack was really just a diversion

658
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:22,817
好让间谍混进基地
to get the operatives on base.

659
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:24,952
谋杀海军响应部队 盗用他们的身份
By killing the Marine Response Force.

660
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,188
因为他们知道 响应部队会是第一个来支援的
Because they knew they'd be the first ones called in,

661
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,189
海军的报警方式
Navy 911.

662
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:29,524
正是
Exactly.

663
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:31,926
但他们有什么目的 为什么要这么做
But to do what? Why go through all this?

664
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:33,661
-障眼法么 -可能是
- Smokescreen? - Probably.

665
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:35,563
潜入绝密区域的最好办法就是
Best way to breach a highly-secure area:

666
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:37,098
制造大范围恐慌
create widespread panic.

667
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,700
Lopez少校的团队
Commander Lopez's team

668
00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:42,169
安装安全电缆通向船只激活中心
was installing secure cables to what D.O.D. had hoped

669
00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:44,038
国防部希望该中心成为圣地亚哥东部
would become the first ship activation center

670
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,507
-第一个船只激活中心 -船只激活中心
- east of San Diego. - Ship activation?

671
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:48,542
你得了解军舰的工作原理
You have to understand how Navy ships work.

672
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:50,311
它们在被编入海军序列前
They're basically just floating hunks of metal

673
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,779
本质上只是漂浮的金属而已
until they're programmed into warships.

674
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:54,315
这个流程是绝密的
<i>It's a highly classified</i> <i>procedure,</i>

675
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,850
希望是利用这个基地来扩大我们的覆盖面
and the hope was this base could expand our reach.

676
00:28:56,852 --> 00:28:58,251
激活的船只越多
The more ships activated,

677
00:28:58,253 --> 00:29:00,020
中国越难以应对
the more the Chinese have to contend with.

678
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:01,154
他们不希望这种事发生
They don't want that to happen.

679
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,089
很显然 他们会不惜任何代价
At all costs, apparently.

680
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:04,558
他们究竟要做什么
So what do they want?

681
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,493
想怎样阻止这项计划
How do they expect to stop the programming?

682
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,629
偷走激活船只的中央处理器
Steal the ship activation CPU

683
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:10,531
以及全部储存着的情报
and all the stored Intel.

684
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:13,033
使国防部对Belle Chasse基地失去信任
Make D.O.D. lose faith in Belle Chasse.

685
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,257
Sebastian
Sebastian.

686
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:20,264
趴下 趴下
Get down, get down!

687
00:30:23,736 --> 00:30:25,470
好了 去看看Sebastian
All right, check on Sebastian.

688
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:27,438
警戒大门 我们必须活捉他们
Alert the gate. We need them taken alive.

689
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,107
-快走 -嫌疑人朝正门开去
- Let's go! - Suspects headed to main gate.

690
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:33,111
逮捕 留活口 重复 逮捕 留活口
Capture, do not kill. Repeat, capture, do not kill.

691
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:43,587
行动
Now.

692
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:46,289
铺开钉刺带 快 快 快
Deploy the spike strip! Go, go, go!

693
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:01,171
-停火 -停火
- Hold your fire! - Cease fire!

694
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,441
停止射击 你们逃不了 你们已经被包围了
Stop shooting! There's nowhere to go; you're surrounded!

695
00:31:04,443 --> 00:31:06,643
手伸出窗户 马上
Hands out the window, now.

696
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,379
现在就伸出来
Do it now!

697
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:12,048
伸出窗外 慢慢地
Outside the window, slow!

698
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:18,721
不 不 不
No, no, no.

699
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:41,742
明白 但还是拜托了 尽你所能
Understood. Please, though, just do everything you can.

700
00:31:41,912 --> 00:31:44,212
在我看到这些嫌疑犯时 就应该看穿他们
I should have known the moment I saw that those operatives

701
00:31:44,214 --> 00:31:45,851
他们的腕部没有密封 不知道怎么的我就忽略了
didn't tape up their wrists-- I don't know how I missed it.

702
00:31:45,852 --> 00:31:49,086
Sebastian 你已经尽力了 你跟踪他们
Sebastian, you did your best. You-you followed them,

703
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:50,797
你与他们交火 火力压制住了他们
you engaged them. You-you were outgunned.

704
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:51,590
我不是这个意思
That's not what I mean.

705
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:53,258
我是说 我知道他们是犯罪分子 我居然没想到
I mean, I knew that they were bad guys, it just didn't

706
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,992
他们之所以不用害怕被感染
occur to me that the only reason they weren't afraid

707
00:31:54,994 --> 00:31:57,462
是因为他们已经接种过了
of being infected was 'cause they had been inoculated.

708
00:31:57,464 --> 00:31:59,229
解毒剂就在他们身体里
The antidote was already in their system.

709
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:00,698
我应该早点意识到那点
I should've figured that out sooner.

710
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,033
也不会有任何改变的
Wouldn't have made any difference.

711
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:04,401
他们不会被活捉的
They weren't gonna be taken alive.

712
00:32:04,403 --> 00:32:06,570
他们受训保护国家机密
They're trained to protect state secrets.

713
00:32:06,572 --> 00:32:08,405
知道么 不计代价
All right? No matter the cost.

714
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:11,241
Sebastian 你可以复制抗体吗
Sebastian, hey, can you duplicate it?

715
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:13,778
我现在正试着分离抗体
I'm-I'm trying to separate the antibodies right now,

716
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,413
但是Wade没有那么多的时间
but Wade doesn't have that much time.

717
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:19,049
King Patton在激活中央处理器的事情上
Hey, King, Patton may have found something

718
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:20,717
有了发现
off the activation CPU...

719
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,085
我现在不关心这个案子 Christopher
I don't care about the case right now, Christopher.

720
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:24,154
这与案子无关 与Wade有关
It's not about the case, it's about Wade.

721
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:26,323
我们发现中央处理器连接到了
We found the CPU hooked up to the docking station

722
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:27,724
特工货车里的扩展基站
in the operative's van.

723
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:29,359
我们在追捕他们的时候 他们正在上传资料
They were uploading it to someone while we were

724
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:31,494
-给别人 -对 不在现场的某个人
- chasing them. - Yeah, someone off-site.

725
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:33,529
他们知道自己不能活着离开
They must've knew they weren't getting out of there alive.

726
00:32:33,531 --> 00:32:35,198
但是还想转移情报
But they still wanted to transfer the Intel

727
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,632
给他们的上司
to whoever they were working for,

728
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:37,867
或许就是负责人
probably the handler.

729
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:39,069
你能追踪到信号么
Can you trace the signal?

730
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:40,336
这就是我们找你的原因
That's why we're calling.

731
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:42,138
正在追查接收者的IP地址
Tracking down the receiver's I.P. address,

732
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,372
确定方位 准备行动
vectoring the location. Stand by.

733
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:44,507
Pride 如果我们能找到负责人
Pride, if we can find the handler...

734
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:45,875
为了预防被感染
There's a good chance he might have

735
00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:47,310
他很可能有解毒剂
the antidote on him as a precaution.

736
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:48,777
找到了 正在发送
Got it, sending it now.

737
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,779
在Chalmette的Alferd Supply
Alferd Supply in Chalmette.

738
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:52,515
在那儿会合
We'll meet you there.

739
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,064
NCIS 举起手来
NCIS! Get your hands up!

740
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,900
联邦探员 不准动
Federal agents! Don't move!

741
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,203
嘿
Hey!

742
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:23,344
氰化物
Cyanide.

743
00:33:23,346 --> 00:33:25,813
-安全 -好的 开始搜索
- Clear. - Okay. Start searching everywhere.

744
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,115
解药一定在这儿的某个地方
That antidote's got to be here somewhere.

745
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:30,150
我们肯定不是在浪费时间
So we're not wasting time here.

746
00:33:30,152 --> 00:33:31,885
你因涉嫌谋杀
You are under arrest for murder,

747
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,187
恐怖袭击与间谍活动被捕
terrorism, espionage.

748
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:35,623
但这些我一点儿也不关心
But I don't care about any of that.

749
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,658
我只想要病毒的解药
All I want is to get the antidote to the virus.

750
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,426
病毒 什么病毒
Virus? What virus?

751
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:40,761
你现在别想来烦我
You do not want to mess with me right now,

752
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:41,995
知道了吗
do you understand that?

753
00:33:41,997 --> 00:33:43,363
因为你 我的朋友就要死了
My friend is dying because of you,

754
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:44,397
如果你不帮我救她
and if you don't help me save her...

755
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,266
我不怕死
I'm not afraid to die.

756
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,568
不怕吗
No?

757
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,404
如果死得很快 可能你不怕 但
Not quickly, maybe, but...

758
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,439
慢慢地死呢
how about slowly?

759
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,744
痛苦地死 就像那些受害者
Painfully, like all your victims.

760
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:03,683
把病毒直接注射到
You know, uh, injecting the baker

761
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,718
蛋糕师体内
directly with the virus...

762
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:14,260
那一定会让他死得更加痛苦
...that must've made his death that much more excruciating.

763
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:16,061
他的大脑迅速膨胀
His brain probably swelled up immediately,

764
00:34:16,063 --> 00:34:18,463
肺里充满血 溺死的感觉
lungs filled with blood, drowning him,

765
00:34:18,465 --> 00:34:20,365
抽搐
convulsions.

766
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:24,569
你不能这样做
You can't do this.

767
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:30,242
他不能 但我能
He can't, but I can.

768
00:34:30,244 --> 00:34:32,844
这里没人能阻止我
And there's nobody's here to stop me.

769
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:35,447
不 等等 那张桌子
No, wait! The table!

770
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,949
解毒剂在那张牌桌下
The antidote's under the card table!

771
00:34:39,052 --> 00:34:40,919
找到了
Got it.

772
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:44,423
好 送到基地和Loretta那儿 快点
All right, get it to the base and Loretta. Hurry!

773
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:46,391
Sebastian
Sebastian.

774
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:48,059
你真的会给他注射吗
Were you really gonna inject him?

775
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:50,228
为了她 我会的
For her, yeah.

776
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,730
去吧
Get going.

777
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:57,401
现在怎么办
What now?

778
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:58,803
现在我们要指控你
Now we're gonna book you.

779
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,104
我们有许多
We got a treasure trove

780
00:35:00,106 --> 00:35:01,940
指控你的证据
of incriminating evidence against you.

781
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:05,109
逃过死刑的唯一方法可能
Probably the only way to get out of the death penalty

782
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:07,277
就是交代出你的上头
is if you admit to who you're working for.

783
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,613
我不会告诉你的
You're not getting that out of me.

784
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:11,582
我认为你要担心的不是我们
Well, I don't think it's us you got to worry about.

785
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:14,752
你要担心国安局和国土安全部反恐部门
Oh, no, that's NSA and DHS territory,

786
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:16,954
如果我没记错的话 关塔那摩监狱...
but if my memory serves me, Guantanamo...

787
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:22,893
怎么回事
What the hell?

788
00:35:22,895 --> 00:35:24,962
有人竟然通过砖墙开枪杀了他
Someone just shot him through a friggin' brick wall!

789
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:33,303
好
Okay.

790
00:35:45,316 --> 00:35:46,983
弹壳
Bullet casing.

791
00:35:50,154 --> 00:35:51,855
还是热的
Still warm.

792
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:54,758
零点五口径的吗
Is that .50 caliber?

793
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,393
不是一般的零点五口径子弹
Not just any .50 caliber.

794
00:35:57,395 --> 00:35:58,827
能穿过砖墙
Penetrates through a brick wall

795
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,863
看不见目标 还能击中目标
without line of sight and still hits its target?

796
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:04,533
一定是国防部高级研究计划局的产品 热感器 热量搜寻器
It's got to be DARPA, thermal scope, heat seeking.

797
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:06,135
一定还有别人
Must have been another operative

798
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:08,570
想要确保他闭嘴
who wanted to make sure that this one didn't talk.

799
00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:10,973
但我不认为那人是中国人
Except I don't think the operative was Chinese.

800
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:12,974
这是美国的技术 Pride
This is U.S. technology, Pride.

801
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:14,943
也是尖端技术
It's brand-new, too.

802
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:18,313
不管是谁干的 一定是个土生土长的美国人
Which means whoever did this had to be homegrown American.

803
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:29,891
敲敲门
Knock, knock.

804
00:36:29,893 --> 00:36:31,393
-嘿 -嘿
- Hey! - Hey.

805
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,030
感觉怎么样了
How you feeling?

806
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,333
这问题有点蠢
That's sort of a stupid question, I know.

807
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:40,435
对不起 我不知道在这样的情况下
I'm sorry. It's-- I-I don't know how to act

808
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:41,869
该做什么 我是说 显然
in situations like this. I mean, obviously,

809
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:43,471
在你经历了这些事以后
after everything you've been through,

810
00:36:43,473 --> 00:36:45,372
你感觉并不好 但同时
you're not feeling great, but at the same time,

811
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:47,174
-我也不知道我 - Sebastian
- I don't know what I'm... - Sebastian.

812
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:49,109
再问我一遍
Just ask me again.

813
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:50,645
你感觉怎么样
How you feeling?

814
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:52,713
我感觉很糟
I feel like crap.

815
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:56,551
但我活下来了 所以我也能接受 谢谢你
But I'm alive and I'll take it, thanks to you.

816
00:36:56,553 --> 00:36:58,252
谢我吗 不 我不能
Thanks to me? No, I can't...

817
00:36:58,254 --> 00:36:59,587
别那么说
Oh, don't even go there.

818
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:01,855
Pride已经告诉我了
Pride already told me what you did.

819
00:37:01,857 --> 00:37:03,757
说你救了我的命
Said you saved my life.

820
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:05,259
我是说
I mean...

821
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:07,161
我没有
I didn't, you know.

822
00:37:07,163 --> 00:37:08,395
算不上有 不是我一个人救的
Not really. Not by myself.

823
00:37:08,397 --> 00:37:10,064
-算是团队合作 -过来
- It was sort of, like, a group... - Come here.

824
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,298
想给你个拥抱
Want to give you a hug.

825
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:15,169
嗯
Mm.

826
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:17,271
谢谢你
Thank you.

827
00:37:17,273 --> 00:37:18,772
随时
Anytime.

828
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:24,811
我为你骄傲 Sebastian
I'm proud of you, Sebastian.

829
00:37:24,813 --> 00:37:28,448
你直面恐惧
You faced your fears.

830
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,185
你冒着生命危险拯救别人
You risked your life to save others.

831
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:35,388
我听说你甚至威胁了那混蛋
I heard you even threatened to go a little rogue.

832
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,722
那就是我听到的事
That's what I heard.

833
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:39,125
是啊
Yeah, well, you know.

834
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:41,294
这意味着 我终于成了一名真正的探员了
Guess that means I'm finally becoming a real agent.

835
00:37:41,296 --> 00:37:42,328
不
No.

836
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:46,432
这意味着 你终于成为了你自己
Means you're finally becoming yourself.

837
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:01,146
嘿
Hey.

838
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:02,948
打扰到你了吗
Am I interrupting?

839
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,583
没有
No.

840
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:06,619
-没 有什么事 -我想应该告诉你
- No. What's up? - Just thought you'd like to know

841
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:08,387
我问了Belle Chasse的医生
I checked with the medic at Belle Chasse.

842
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:10,122
所有人都在康复
Everyone's recovering.

843
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:13,825
很好 很好
Good. Good.

844
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:17,195
前几天真是大起大落啊 对吧
Kind of a major whirlwind last couple of days, huh?

845
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:19,431
还不敢相信发生了这些事情
I still can't believe everything that happened.

846
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:22,134
还有那些差点发生的事
And everything that almost happened.

847
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:24,268
是啊 但很奇怪啊
Right? So strange, though.

848
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,770
所有事都会沉寂
All that goes down all the time,

849
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:27,772
人们不会知道发生什么
public never even knows about it.

850
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:30,374
有时不那么容易保密
Not easy keeping it that way sometimes.

851
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:37,415
还有别的事吗
Something else?

852
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:38,650
有
Yeah.

853
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,185
我在杀死那个负责人的
I, uh, got a partial fingerprint

854
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:44,788
零点五口径的弹壳上 发现了部分指纹
on the .50 caliber cartridge that killed our handler.

855
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,190
-找出身份信息了吗 - 没有
- You get an I.D.? - No.

856
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:47,591
但我想你会觉得这很有趣
But I think you'll find this interesting.

857
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:50,227
这指纹结果与
Turns out the print matches the partial

858
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:54,031
Sebastian在Garcia引爆装置上提取到的指纹相同
Sebastian lifted off of Garcia's detonator you guys found.

859
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:56,233
是的
Yep.

860
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:58,468
同一个人杀了他们两个
Same person killed both people.

861
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,506
等等
But wait.

862
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,341
如果是真的 那就意味着
If that's true, then that would mean...

863
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,543
那意味着
That would mean

864
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,378
杀手为Hamilton市长工作
the killer's working for Mayor Hamilton,

865
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,713
也意味着
which also means

866
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,648
Hamilton可能是这两起凶杀案的幕后黑手
Hamilton could be behind both killings.

867
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,849
如果是这样的话
And, if so,

868
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,650
不管市长担当了什么角色
whatever the good mayor is up to

869
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,519
都要比我们想象得权力大
is a lot bigger than we thought.

870
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,223
难怪他要威胁我们
No wonder he's trying to threaten us.

871
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,599
你来晚了 Dwayne
You're late, Dwayne.

872
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,200
我以为你不会来
Thought you weren't gonna show.

873
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,403
不想让你失望 市长先生
Wouldn't want to disappoint you, Mr. Mayor.

874
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,739
很好 我很高兴
Good, I'm glad.

875
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,340
那是给我的吗
That for me?

876
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,511
是的
Yeah.

877
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,551
等等 等等 这是什么
Whoa, wait, wait. Wh-What is this?

878
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:54,022
我告诉过你 我要你手中关于Garcia被杀一案的所有资料
I told you I wanted everything you had on Garcia's murder.

879
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,357
我记得
I remember.

880
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,212
放马过来
Gloves are off.

881
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:03,549
你说的
Your words.
