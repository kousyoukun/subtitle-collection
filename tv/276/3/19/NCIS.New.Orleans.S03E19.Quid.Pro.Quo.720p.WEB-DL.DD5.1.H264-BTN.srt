            (groans)

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,056
            (gasps)

4
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,457
      Hey, what the hell?

5
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,692
    You could've killed me!

6
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,060
            What are you doing?!

7
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,695
              Campbell! You want
                to explain to me

8
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,530
           why you didn't secure
                 that equipment?

9
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,566
     Make it stop. Please.

10
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,368
Make it stop.
   All-all right. All right.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,636
              Calm down, sailor.
                   What's wrong?

12
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:38,737
          Get it out.

13
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,272
                            Hey.
     Get it out of my head!

14
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,473
             RICE: Hey, somebody
             get him some water.

15
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,208
                  Water, please.
           (groaning)

16
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:45,711
                 Hey. It's okay.
            No. No.

17
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,546
        Hey, you're gonna be all
   right. You're gonna be-- Hey!

18
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,151

SEBASTIAN:
I'm telling you, Pride,

27
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,249
if I'm right about this,
then I'm wrong.

28
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,151
Well, not that-that
I was wrong, per se,

29
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,753
   but just that the initial
  calculations were incorrect.

30
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,588
        But since those
       came from the FBI

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,290
and not me...
           Rambling.

32
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,125
         Right, sorry.

33
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:34,793
   It's an ongoing challenge.

34
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,596
  We've come out here many times
      in the last several weeks,

35
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,165
and have yet to find anything
to help us figure out

36
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,633
who killed Javier Garcia.
                    Okay, right.

37
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,802
       Well, that-that brings us
       back to the calculations.

38
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,838
        So, we've been operating
                under the belief

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,806
     that the upward thrust
  of the car bomb's detonator

40
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,809
     sent the shrapnel out
  in a concentric arc, right?

41
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,611
             Yeah?
      But what if the FBI
        never accounted

42
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,147
  for a-a lateral dispersion?

43
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,150
       Well, then the blast zone
would've been more asymmetrical?

44
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,418
            Exactly.

45
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,753
Which would've sent
the shrapnel out

46
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,305
in a whole different
trajectory.

47
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:04,856
Now, if<i> my</i> calculations
are right,

48
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,127
                we might be able
            to find something...

49
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:08,827
           (beeping)

50
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:09,895
       ...right around...

51
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,230
        (rapid beeping)

52
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,132
                       ...there.

53
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,141
            Or not.

54
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,178
                         (sighs)

55
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:34,620
How about...
something like this?

56
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,890
           Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,725
                   Melted metal,

58
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,360
           outward protuberance,
                     yeah, yeah.

59
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,762
              This-this could be
             from the detonator.

60
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,864
Pride, this might be the smoking
  gun we've been looking for.

61
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:49,301
     Pretty charred though;
   been out here a long time.

62
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,436
    Still think you can get
        trace evidence?

63
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,538
           Oh, yeah, believe me,

64
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,939
     if I can find anything

65
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,942
     to link Mayor Hamilton
  to Garcia's murder, I will.

66
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,877
        I know how much
       this means to you.

67
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,512
        (phone beeping)
            Thanks.

68
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:02,781
(sighs)

69
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,816
Well, we're gonna
have to backburner it for now.

70
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:05,951
We got to work.

71
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:08,187
       Dead petty officer
        in Belle Chasse.

72
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,354
           Let's go.

73
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,562
      (jet engine roaring)

74
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,197
             PRIDE:
 <i> What do we know, Christopher?</i>

75
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,199
 Petty Officer Robert Campbell,

76
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,301
   a member of a construction
  detachment out of Gulfport,

77
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:25,470
took a dive from five stories up
      for reasons unknown.

78
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,705
                       As in, he
                 killed himself?

79
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,207
     That's what we're here
          to find out.

80
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,808
That was Campbell's
officer in charge.

81
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,410
He said
before Campbell jumped,

82
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:32,744
        he talked about
      a pain in his head,

83
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,379
   that he couldn't take it.

84
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,481
Okay. Any history of drug abuse,

85
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,283
psychological issues?

86
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,285
   Well, psych eval's normal,
       drug tests clean.

87
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,688
     Nothing I can see here
that would raise any red flags.

88
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,656
          I questioned
 nearly every man in his unit;

89
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,491
         they all said
   Campbell was full of life,

90
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,594
the last guy
they'd expect that from.

91
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,896
            PRIDE: A man doesn't
        just jump for no reason.

92
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,865
             Something drove him
                  over the edge.

93
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,001
              Need to know what.
                        Loretta.

94
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,502
Well, judging from
the massive head trauma

95
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,571
and the hemorrhaging
from the ears, nose and mouth...

96
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,640
       (camera clicking)

97
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:02,808
...there's no doubt
Campbell died

98
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,409
from the impact of the fall.

99
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,912
   He complained of head pain
     just before he jumped.

100
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,981
                  Any indication
              of what caused it?

101
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,416
      I'd have to get him
         into autopsy,

102
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,353
         but there was
      one thing peculiar.

103
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,322
         His eyes are jaundiced.

104
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,324
       That didn't happen
         from the fall.

105
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:22,961
But some pre-existing condition
   could've made that happen.

106
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,630
       Yeah, gallstones,
       bile obstructions.

107
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:25,998
Something tells me constipation

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,599
     isn't what pushed him
        over the ledge.

109
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,967
LOPEZ:
Agent Pride?

110
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,303
Lieutenant Commander Lopez.

111
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,671
I'm sorry I wasn't here
to greet you.

112
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,039
I had to update
the base C.O.

113
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,274
                 Commander.

114
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,808
                 P.O. Campbell's
                   one of yours?

115
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,945
I've been overseeing
the Seabees' work here,

116
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,880
40 of the finest men in uniform.

117
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:45,450
    I'm sorry for your loss.

118
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,386
     Any idea why Campbell
      might've done this?

119
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,354
           No, none.

120
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,790
 He's been on time and on task,
    and working his tail off

121
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,892
    with the rest of my men
    to complete the install.

122
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,828
           What is it
  that you're installing here?

123
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,830
                High-speed fiber
                    optic cable.

124
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,532
  Wiring the entire building.

125
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,969
   Travel these men down from
Gulfport just to lay some cable?

126
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,471
The base's newest I.T. building.

127
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,906
       Getting it online

128
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,375
is paramount
for a variety of reasons.

129
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,313
  Do you mind if I go check up
     on the rest of my men?

130
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,547
They're pretty shaken.

131
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:16,615
            Course.

132
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,724
              Something wrong?

133
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,826
          No, just...

134
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,562
  seems strange to bring down
       a detachment unit

135
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,398
        just to install
       fiber optic cable.

136
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,100
      Well, it is a pretty
      specialized install.

137
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,768
                        LASALLE:
            Hey, check this out.

138
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,937
   I just did a quick rundown
      on Campbell's unit.

139
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,339
                   Looks like he
             wasn't the only one

140
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,473
       not feeling well.

141
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,674
           All right,
   Petty Officer Bryan Howard

142
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,743
              apparently checked
                    himself into

143
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:45,811
                 the base clinic
                     last night,

144
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,813
and he is now sick in quarters.

145
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,382
   You'd think the commander
    would've mentioned that.

146
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,085
    Sebastian, go with Wade
      back to the morgue,

147
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,536
               when she's ready.

148
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:55,986
             Let me know as soon
                 as you find out

149
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,357
what Campbell might've been
suffering from.

150
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:01,660
    Meanwhile, we'll go pay
 Petty Officer Howard a visit.

151
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,936
    I woke up in the middle
         of the night,

152
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:14,406
      felt this pressure,
 like my head was gonna burst.

153
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,408
        Thoughts weren't
       making any sense.

154
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,377
   It was scary as hell, man.

155
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,545
    So you checked yourself
        into the clinic?

156
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,148
         Doc said I had
     dehydration sickness.

157
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,685
      Gave me some fluids,
 sedatives, sent me on my way.

158
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,787
   Well, you were up on that
   scaffolding with Campbell

159
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,556
all week, exposed to the sun,
working your butt off, right?

160
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,791
         That's right.

161
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,092
 So, dehydration, heat stroke--

162
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,594
   maybe that's what this is.

163
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,562
                      (coughing)

164
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,832
If that's all this is, he should
   be getting better, not worse.

165
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,603
           You mind?

166
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,474
    His eyes are jaundiced,
     just like Campbell's.

167
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,410
HOWARD: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
are you saying

168
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,412
      whatever I've got's
     what made Robert jump?

169
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,714
            No, we're not saying
               anything, sailor.

170
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:59,050
       We're just trying
  to figure out what happened.

171
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,186
So, you woke up
in the middle of the night,

172
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,187
             sick.

173
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,122
    Any idea what caused it?

174
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,690
                   I don't know.

175
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,559
GREGORIO: When did Campbell
start showing symptoms?

176
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,428
     Around the same time?
                    Yeah, about.

177
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,530
 But he just went back to bed.

178
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,131
         Look, Campbell
       was a beast, okay?

179
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,634
   He probably could've taken
a bullet and gone back to work.

180
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,868
Anybody else get sick?

181
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,036
I mean,
something's going around.

182
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,171
You share any food or drink?

183
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,440
                 No. Although...

184
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,076
         Although what?

185
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,646
       We had a king cake
        delivered to us.

186
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,847
        We all had some.

187
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,148
       Delivered by who?

188
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,485
      The note just said,
   "Welcome to Belle Chasse."

189
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,705
                   We didn't eat
                      all of it.

190
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,956
      I think Robert stashed the
        rest in his foot locker.

191
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,566
    Angelo Brocato's cakes.

192
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,236
             Whoa.

193
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,504
             King,

194
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,039
            take a look at this.

195
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,542
              Blood in the eyes,
              foam in the mouth.

196
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,911
    No way that's just from
     food poisoning, right?

197
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,548
            No way.

198
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,735
  Any idea what kind of poison
 we might be dealing with here?

199
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,237
             I've tested all the
                usual suspects--

200
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:29,107
  cyanide, arsenic, strychnine--
    they all came back negative.

201
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,244
           SEBASTIAN:
 Yeah, and I checked for ricin,
  sarin and poison arrow frog.

202
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,245
No match.

203
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,846
                Still, some type
                       of poison

204
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,182
           mutated Petty Officer
               Campbell's cells,

205
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,817
 caused severe brain swelling.

206
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,286
         That explains
 what drove him off the ledge.

207
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,288
You know, tetrodotoxin
could've caused cell mutation,

208
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,657
but it... it's faster acting
than what killed Campbell.

209
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,025
 Have you checked for polonium?

210
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,560
                    Hey.

211
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,563
   Why aren't the two of you
     working side by side?

212
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,999
               Sebastian's a bit
             of a hypochondriac.

213
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,868
Or, you know, some people
might just say extra careful.

214
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,670
       You know. I-I have
     a thing about poisons.

215
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,572
 It's like how some people are

216
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:04,242
afraid of snakes or spiders or..
circus clowns, you know.

217
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,212
Four more Seabees from
Campbell's unit were just

218
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,747
         admitted into a clinic,

219
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,882
        and Petty Officer Howard
              is getting sicker.

220
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,250
The base C.O. is isolating them

221
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,752
        until they know
       what's causing it.

222
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,587
         WADE: It's odd
   that it's affecting people

223
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,589
   at vastly different rates.

224
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,024
           Poisons don't usually
                  work that way.

225
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,293
          Then we need
     to find out what does

226
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,694
  before we lose anyone else.

227
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,696
 Sebastian, work<i> with</i> Loretta,

228
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,097
side by side, and learn things.

229
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,165
        Okay, but the...

230
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,235
Need to know who ordered
that cake, Patton.

231
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,604
   And I wish I can tell you,
          but I can't

232
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,972
  get anybody from the bakery
         on the phone.

233
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,607
This time of day,
that's strange.

234
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,709
     Yeah, but I did check
with the base, and according to

235
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,245
 their gate log, Angelo Brocato
  did, in fact, deliver a cake

236
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,981
        at 21:00 hours.
       Addressed to who?

237
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,116
     No name in particular,
       just Barracks 53.

238
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,285
        Campbell's unit.
Sounds like they were targeted.

239
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,287
Why? Bunch of Seabees
installing cables.

240
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,323
                Yeah, maybe not.

241
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,824
          Christopher, Gregorio,
         go to Angelo Brocato's.

242
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,826
                  I want to know
             who sent that cake.

243
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,962
                  Patton, search
            surveillance cameras

244
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,663
       around the bakery,

245
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,732
   I.D. everyone who came in
  and out of there yesterday.

246
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,734
           Copy that.
        Who you calling?

247
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,603
                   Belle Chasse.
        Commander Lopez, please.

248
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,905
       I want to know what those
      Seabees were really doing.

249
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,341
Tell her
it's Agent Pride, NCIS.

250
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,715
     (vehicle door closes)

251
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,020
                      Excuse me.

252
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,655
        Federal agents.
         You work here?

253
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,656
                       Um, yeah.

254
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,091
                   Why? Is there
                something wrong?

255
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,259
   The bakery usually closed
         at this hour?

256
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,394
      No.

257
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,296
 Should've been open hours ago.

258
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,164
         I mean, I just got here
         for my afternoon shift.

259
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,300
        I don't know why
    my boss didn't call me.

260
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,103
                 Honestly, I'm a
                 little worried.

261
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,373
         (door creaks)

262
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,120
         (door creaks)

263
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,188
          Door's open.

264
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,015
Oh, no. Jaundiced eyes
and foaming at the mouth.

265
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,318
                   Same symptoms
                 as the Seabees.

266
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,987
  From sampling the same cake?

267
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,355
I don't think so.

268
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,058
He's got defensive wounds
on his arms and hands.

269
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,426
 Looks like he put up a fight.

270
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,960
           And lost.

271
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,231
       What in the world
       is going on here?

272
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,000
(sighs)

273
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,304
    Richard Logan's been working
             at Angelo Brocato's

274
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,306
                  for as long as
                 I can remember.

275
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,308
Yeah, best pastry chef
they've got, too.

276
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,343
Folks order
his king cakes by name.

277
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,979
Only way he would've poisoned
the Seabees' cake...

278
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,382
             Is if he was forced
                  into doing it.

279
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,217
      Doc says the killer
       knocked out Logan

280
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,186
   and must have injected him

281
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,021
            with the same poison
         that killed our Seabee.

282
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,422
She got time of death?

283
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,157
               Yes. Between 9:00
           and 10:00 last night,

284
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,026
             which, according to
        Patton, is the same time

285
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,761
     the cake was delivered
          to the base.

286
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,897
             So killer waits for
             customers to leave,

287
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,999
                forces the baker
             to poison the cake,

288
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,769
    and then waits... until
it's delivered to kill him? Why?

289
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,104
Killer probably
didn't want

290
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,473
      Logan to I.D. him--
   tried to cover his tracks.

291
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,842
      Yeah, but by leaving
  Logan's body for us to find,

292
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,210
     it does anything but.

293
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,444
            Sloppy.

294
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,046
It doesn't make sense.
                  Yeah.

295
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,748
        Still, you think
   our Seabees were targeted?

296
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,750
       No reason not to.

297
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,751
  Especially since I can't get
in contact with Commander Lopez.

298
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,353
   Even checked with her C.O.

299
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,422
                    at Gulfport.
      Think she went U.A.?

300
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,290
         The base C.O.
    at Belle Chasse checked

301
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,525
                  the exit logs;
              says that she left

302
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,427
right after we did this morning.

303
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,230
   So, wait, are we thinking
      she's a suspect now?

304
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,065
     Well, only way to know
        is to find her.

305
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,466
            PATTON: Ah. One step
                 ahead of y'all.

306
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,968
Check it out.

307
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,770
I was combing through
surveillance footage

308
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,538
around the bakery.

309
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,473
                Not a suspicious
              customer in sight,

310
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:59,110
       until... I decided
  to expand my search window.

311
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,812
             Voila.

312
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,548
        Commander Lopez.

313
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,983
Lopez? What is
she doing there?

314
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,151
      When was this taken?

315
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,318
  About a hour and a half ago.

316
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,154
That's right before
Tammy and I got there.

317
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,822
Think we chased her away?

318
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,057
Well, still, what was she doing
there in the first place?

319
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,227
Especially considering the baker
had been dead for hours.

320
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:19,531
Yeah, too many things don't add
up, and no one's talking to us.

321
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,566
I'll call Director Vance.

322
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,535
              See if he can cut
       through this bureaucracy.

323
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,470
Guys, we got big problems.

324
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,071
     WADE: Yeah, I'm afraid
     it's not good, Dwayne.

325
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,540
No, it's worse than not good.

326
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,075
   It turns out that the cake
  wasn't spiked with a poison,

327
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,477
it was injected with a virus.

328
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,479
    When I couldn't identify
    the poison, I rechecked

329
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,548
    the molecular structure
    of the affected cells...

330
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,917
      And discovered that
    it was actually infested

331
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,485
with microscopic,

332
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,554
      single-strand RNAs.

333
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:43,805
       Which means virus?

334
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,055
           SEBASTIAN:
 Yeah, but not just any virus.

335
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,058
A supervirus--
we're talking

336
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,861
  Congolese hemorrhagic fever,
         dengue, Ebola

337
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:50,829
all rolled into one.

338
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,698
       Is it contagious?

339
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,566
     Very. But fortunately
         not airborne.

340
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,334
       SEBASTIAN: Right.
 The only way to contract it is

341
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,936
   either through ingestion,
    like with the king cake,

342
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,104
          or by touch,
  so any skin-to-skin contact

343
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,106
       with the infected
       can risk exposure.

344
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,842
          Means anyone
 who's been around our Seabees

345
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,577
   or the cake could get it.

346
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,945
         The whole base
      could be in danger.

347
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,279
          So could we.

348
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,882
       Except none of us
  have shown any symptoms yet.

349
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,250
Still no reason
to take chances.

350
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,853
We stay put in the office
till we all get tested.

351
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:15,520
        Is there a cure?

352
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,855
Not that I know of.

353
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,874
                        LASALLE:
                           King.

354
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,892
    This could be more than
 just an attack on our Seabees.

355
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,193
     Could be bioterrorism.

356
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,130
               Get the base C.O.
                   on the phone.

357
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,632
     We're gonna lock down
         Belle Chasse.

358
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,334
  We cannot let this get out.

359
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,401
            Dwayne.

360
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,204
           (panting)

361
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,873
   I'm afraid it already has.

362
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,739
                            MAN:
                       Dr. Wade?

363
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,140
          Oh, please,
  we're wasting valuable time.

364
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,541
       Let me just work.
                     Yes, ma'am.

365
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,978
            Loretta!

366
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,047
Loretta.

367
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,551
Talk to me, Loretta.
How did this happen?

368
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,487
            (sighs)
     It must have happened

369
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,489
             at the crime scene.

370
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,490
       Without my scrub suit on,
            my skin was exposed.

371
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,092
And you handled Campbell's body?

372
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:32,630
       Yeah. Blood particulates,
                  saliva, sweat.

373
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,565
              Doesn't take much.

374
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,503
           I assume you and your
             team are all right.

375
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,138
Yeah, we-we all tested negative.

376
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,639
                   Ah, thank God
                       for that.

377
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,608
         Sebastian cleared, too.

378
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,376
                        (laughs)

379
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,578
            Next time, remind me
                not to tease him

380
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,415
   about being a hypochondriac--
     it may have saved his life.

381
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,483
               (coughing loudly)

382
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,422
   Should you rest, Loretta?

383
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,957
        There's no time to rest,

384
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,525
                 not with others
            being infected, too,

385
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,293
                and more to come

386
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,096
           if we can't stop this
           virus from spreading.

387
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,232
                The situation at
                   Belle Chasse?

388
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:11,135
      Base is locked down,
     the sick quarantined.

389
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,604
 Marine Chemical and Biological
    Incident Response Force

390
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,306
         is on its way.

391
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,442
   How many infected so far?

392
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,711
Seven total--
four of Campbell's Seabees,

393
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,513
  three machinists who shared
    the barracks with them.

394
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,049
            Burn their clothing,
           all their belongings.

395
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,684
              It's not airborne,

396
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:30,154
              but obviously it's
              highly contagious.

397
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,624
             Deadly, if we can't
                  find the cure.

398
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,426
   How much time do we have?

399
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,629
               You mean how much
                 time do<i> I</i> have?

400
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,631
                         Well...

401
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,735
               the virus affects
          everybody differently.

402
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:47,605
          But I am monitoring my
        viral load while I work,

403
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:51,542
      see how quickly it mutates
           my white blood cells.

404
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:55,046
            I would say maybe...

405
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:58,216
         ten, 11 hours before...

406
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,657
        I can't believe
    that this is happening.

407
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,659
                How's she doing?

408
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,661
Scared, like the rest of us.

409
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,697
She's counting on us, Sebastian.

410
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,566
         Stay focused,
     for everybody's sake.

411
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,735
  Yeah, easier said than done.

412
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,537
        (computer beeps)

413
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,273
          Got a match
    from the viral database.

414
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,509
                            QR6.
         What is that?

415
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,744
   It's a-a supervirus developed
        by the Chinese military,

416
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,547
              but supposedly, it
           never left their lab.

417
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,682
   Pride, if this is right, then
    this has to be bioterrorism.

418
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,684
              I mean, there's no
              two ways about it.

419
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,819
 But why now? Why Belle Chasse?

420
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,354
                   I don't know.

421
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,656
   I mean, the only good news
     is that there's no way

422
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,691
   they would have developed
       this lethal a bug

423
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,527
    without also developing
          an antidote.

424
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,462
       So even if Loretta
  can't come up with a cure...

425
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,230
              Yeah, then we can,
               as long as we can

426
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,532
           find whoever infected
                 that king cake.

427
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,167
         'Cause they'll
  probably have the antidote,

428
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,635
     since they don't want
     to get infected, too.

429
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,703
        Only problem is we don't
            have that much time.

430
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,338
All right, stay here,
help Loretta.

431
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,374
          Wait, hold on, you got
         to get me on that base.
        What?

432
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,176
      Victims are being infected
      at different rates, right?

433
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,811
            Which means some are
           more resistant to the
              virus than others.

434
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:03,614
If I can test their blood, then
maybe I can create my own cure.

435
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,683
  I'm-I'm not willing to risk
    you getting sick, too...

436
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,085
    That's not your choice!

437
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,789
         Please, Pride.

438
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,191
     I-I know that you want

439
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,859
            to do everything you
            can to save Loretta,

440
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,461
    but so do I, all right?

441
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,629
      I-I can't lose her.

442
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,632
            (sighs)

443
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,237
   We're not gonna lose her,
           Sebastian.

444
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:33,377
      I'll get you on with
 the Marine Bio Response Force.

445
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,646
You work with them,
but listen to me--

446
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,248
          hazmat suit,

447
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,783
wrist tape, the works.

448
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,652
   I can't lose<i> you,</i> either.

449
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,626
        Oh, wait. Pride.

450
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,827
                     Pride.

451
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,762
          I almost forgot. Uh...

452
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,564
             I was able to get a
             partial fingerprint

453
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,799
                off of that, uh,
                Garcia shrapnel.

454
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,601
                 It's not enough
                    for an I.D.,

455
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,436
           and obviously it's no
          way to tie the bombing

456
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,838
       to Mayor Hamilton,
       but it's a start.

457
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,807
Okay, wh-why are you
showing me this now?

458
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,576
    Just, you know, in case
    something happens to me.

459
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,816
   We'll work on this later,
      Sebastian, together.

460
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,284
        (phone ringing)

461
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,886
             Focus.

464
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,277
Just got off the phone with the
 Office of Naval Intelligence.

465
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,679
           Finally admitted that
    Commander Lopez and her team

466
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,781
                      were doing
                  more than just

467
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,750
                installing cable

More, meaning what?
                 Don't know yet.

469
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,788
             ONI needs clearance
              to get us read in.

470
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,457
Apparently, it's top secret,
compartmentalized.

471
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,326
They want to keep it that way

472
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,827
until they can get
more specifics

473
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,930
about what the Chinese
are really after.

474
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,965
Targeting Seabees
on a top secret project

475
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,833
                    not specific
                enough for them?

476
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,469
The less people know
exactly what the project is,

477
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,472
the better,
far as they're concerned.

478
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:12,643
   ONI just wants us focusing on
 catching whoever's responsible.

479
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,879
  What about Commander Lopez?
    Did they hear from her?

480
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,881
    No. And they're worried.

481
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,517
   Turns out they're the ones
   who sent her to the bakery

482
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,252
    to quietly investigate.

483
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,854
  Well, maybe she heard about
  the king cake from her men.

484
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,890
     At least that explains
       why she was there.

485
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,225
       Yeah, but not why
        she disappeared.

486
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,659
       You find anything
       on the watch list?

487
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,862
Yeah, a list of Chinese
nationals linked to MSS,

488
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,864
but it'll take us all week
to narrow it down.

489
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,333
 Loretta doesn't have all week

490
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,867
         and neither do
       the other victims.

491
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,737
We need another way to find out
      who did this, fast.

492
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,606
                      Might have
              something in here.

493
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,341
         Been I.D.-ing
      every person and car

494
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,243
 in or around Angelo Brocato's

495
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,877
        around the time
     of the baker's murder.

496
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,946
    Nothing came up until...

497
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:52,516
    We matched the license plate
      to a silver Toyota 4Runner

498
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:53,951
  reported stolen two days ago
          driving by.

499
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,686
     Time stamp: 9:33 p.m.

500
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,255
 Could be a coincidence, or...

501
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,789
Could be our operatives.
Good work.

502
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,926
            I'll put a BOLO out,
        notify LSP and FBI, too.

503
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,861
     Should we trigger EAS,
            go wide?

504
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,696
      I mean, it's just...
No, no, no, no, no.

505
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,765
The media gets ahold of this
and puts it out there,

506
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,533
could cause a panic
that the virus

507
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,269
is gonna spread
beyond the base.

508
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,538
Make it all that more difficult
    to find our operatives.

509
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,973
  Well, the health department
         already knows.

510
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,808
They quarantined Wade's morgue.

511
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,777
   It's just a matter of time
  before the media finds out.

512
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,312
                 Yep, and stokes
                    public fear.

513
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,714
We have to keep this contained.

514
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,952
    Only one way to do that.

515
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,857
          Let me know
    when you find that car.

516
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,558
       Where's he going?

517
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,061
   I bet it's the last place
        he wants to go.

518
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,498
    (trolley bell clanging)

519
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,799
      <i> (Hamilton chuckles)</i>

520
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,868
         You got stones, Dwayne,
        I'll give you that much.

521
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,038
 Last thing we both need is for
the media to get ahold of this.

522
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,740
       They've already contacted
      my office, more than once.

523
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:53,044
Media hysteria is not gonna help
 me find out who's responsible.

524
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:54,979
 In fact, it'll hurt the cause.

525
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:59,483
I got a lead, just need
a day or two, maybe less.

526
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,952
          Still, I couldn't very
         well lie to the people.

527
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,954
I wouldn't be a very good mayor
     if I did, now would I?

528
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,024
 Apparently the Office of Public
   Health is getting calls, too.

529
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,927
           They're asking for an
             official statement.

530
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,897
        And by the way,
      how's Loretta doing?

531
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:19,603
           Real shame, isn't it?

532
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,872
           So, what?

533
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:24,408
You're gonna make this personal,
          is that it?

534
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,744
This is about trying
to stop an outbreak,

535
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,779
    saving innocent people;
 this isn't about us, Hamilton.

536
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,081
  The hell it's not about us.

537
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,983
     Everything's about us
         since Garcia.

538
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,919
           You may not see this,
        Dwayne, but the truth is

539
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:37,955
  we both want the same thing:
   what's good for this city.

540
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,924
                The only problem
               is that you think

541
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,992
     that bringing me down
  is the best way to do that,

542
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,594
       and I can't allow
        that to happen.

543
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,997
      So what do you want?

544
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:50,501
 I want whatever you got on me.

545
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,403
  Whatever you<i> think</i> you got.

546
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:53,671
       Vis-à-vis Garcia.

547
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,039
Sounds like an admission to me.

548
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,791
    Not admitting anything.

549
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,542
          I just want you off my
          back once and for all.

550
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,611
     So you're threatening
  to impede my investigation,

551
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:04,014
  risk causing widespread fear
  just to cover your own ass?

552
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,416
         You're the one
     doing the threatening,

553
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:06,917
and I'm not gonna stand for it,

554
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,719
          not anymore,
  even if it means getting you

555
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,688
    and your whole damn team
   kicked out of New Orleans.

556
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,590
        NCIS is federal.

557
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:15,025
    You don't have the power
     or the jurisdiction...

558
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,961
     Oh, man, jurisdiction
     doesn't mean anything

559
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:18,929
    if you got connections.

560
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:21,098
 And me and SECDEF go way back,

561
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,700
                     believe me.

562
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:25,002
             Apparently, there's
                something called

563
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,537
           a mobility agreement.

564
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,938
                    Says that if
               Navy brass thinks

565
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,174
               NCIS and the city
           aren't getting along,

566
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:33,110
        well, they can re-assign
         you to God knows where.

567
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:37,114
         Gloves are off, Dwayne.

568
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,083
          You want my help, hmm?

569
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,051
                    Cooperation?
               That only happens

570
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:44,789
   you get me everything you got
on Garcia by this time tomorrow.

571
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,490
                     Understand?

572
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,965
           GREGORIO:
   We didn't get a BOLO hit,

573
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,635
   but Patton's been tracking
    satellite radio signals

574
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:59,003
from every 4Runner in the area,

575
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:00,571
  when one suddenly vanished.

576
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,673
I think we just found it.
                       Gregorio.

577
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,208
     LASALLE: Look at this.
          What is it?

578
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,111
LASALLE:
I'm pretty sure it's Lopez.

579
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,649
    Lopez is inside, Pride.

580
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,551
          She's dead.

581
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,586
       Must've caught her
         investigating.

582
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,555
   Two more in the backseat.

583
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:20,691
        Wait. Two more?

584
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:23,027
         Who are they?

585
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,764
      I just got DNA I.D.s
        on both victims,

586
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:29,667
     but I'm afraid you're
      not gonna like this.

587
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,769
(clears throat)
They're marines.

588
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,938
I'm sending the files
to you now.

589
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,573
           (coughing)

590
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:38,075
Loretta, you have
to lie down.

591
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,777
We've been through this, Dwayne.

592
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,847
 We both know I'm not the only
    one running out of time.

593
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,517
LASALLE: Wait a second,
those aren't just any marines.

594
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,486
   All right? They're part of
  a Biological Response Force

595
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,020
        that was headed
       for Belle Chasse.

596
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,755
                 GREGORIO: Wait,
         operatives killed Lopez

597
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,757
   because she was investigating
         them-- that much I get.

598
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,926
   But why intercept and kill
         the other two?

599
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,028
        Try to keep them
  from stopping the outbreak?

600
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,930
LASALLE: Hold on.
According to the Belle Chasse

601
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,066
           entry log,
    Corporals Davis and Lin

602
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:04,969
just checked in at the main gate
     along with their unit.

603
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,604
    GREGORIO: So operatives
      must have snuck in,

604
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:07,938
       killed them while
      they were traveling

605
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,607
    with the marine convoy.

606
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,142
           But they did all that
      just to steal their I.D.s?

607
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,944
  LASALLE: Well, that doesn't
        make any sense.

608
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,647
  I mean, if they're with the
 people that infected the base,

609
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,148
    that'd be the last place
       they'd want to go.

610
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,149
            Dwayne.

611
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,651
I know, I know.

612
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,186
Sebastian's at Belle Chasse

613
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,787
waiting for the Response Force.

614
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,156
   Which means he has no idea
  who those people really are.

615
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,625
        (clears throat)

616
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,093
    SEBASTIAN:<i> You guys from</i>
      <i> the Response Force?</i>

617
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,062
Yeah. Lance Corporal Lin, Davis.

618
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,797
 Rest of the team's on its way.

619
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,299
                    Who are you?
   NCIS, Forensic Agent Lund.

620
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,268
     I'm here to figure out
     how this all happened,

621
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,570
     but more importantly,
      how we can stop it.

622
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:40,905
Come on,
let's get geared up.

623
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:43,974
    Straight to voice mail.

624
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,142
We got to get to the base.

625
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,210
           (coughing)

626
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,311
   Christopher, keep calling

627
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,213
          Sebastian on his cell.

628
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,614
         I'll call ONI.

629
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:51,615
           Gregorio,

630
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,083
get the base police

631
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,585
    to secure Belle Chasse,

632
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,620
  put the gates on high alert.

633
00:25:56,622 --> 00:26:00,624
 Loretta, I'll call you as soon
 as we know anything, promise.

634
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,160
      (coughing, wheezing)

635
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,865
         Hey! Dr. Wade!

636
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:25,282
       (monitor beeping)

637
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:27,618
    DOCTOR: Last antibiotic
     isn't working, either.

638
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,819
    Get me carbapenem, stat.

639
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,154
      Let's intubate her.

640
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:32,790
               Come on, come on.
               Hurry up, people.

641
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,993
    If we want to save her,
  we've got to stabilize her.

642
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,963
             PRIDE:
   Is she conscious, talking?

643
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,764
All right, you tell her
to take care

644
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,067
and that we're out here doing
everything we can on our end.

645
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,902
Thank you.
          How's Wade?

646
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,104
Thinking about putting her
in a medically induced coma

647
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,239
to slow her metabolism,
buy time.

648
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,008
                   How much time
                       she have?

649
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,343
                       Not much.
    Agent Pride.

650
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,244
I'm Captain Rogers,
Base Commanding Officer here.

651
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,013
      Any luck finding my agent?

652
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:58,349
Not yet, but it's a large base;
we're still searching.

653
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:01,251
  But we're under full lockdown,
     every access point guarded.

654
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,853
                Operatives won't
               be able to escape

655
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:04,388
without going through us.
   Okay, well, the problem is

656
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,090
   we got to take them alive.

657
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:08,025
   They may be the only ones
       with an antidote.

658
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,393
Still can't
reach Sebastian, King.

659
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,028
                    Why would he
             turn off his phone?

660
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,130
He wouldn't.

661
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,367
Is there a secure area on base
where cell phones are jammed?

662
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,935
                         DOWNEY:
                  Yes, there is.

663
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:19,336
       Commander Downey,
      Naval Intelligence.

664
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,971
  We spoke earlier. Follow me.
                       Yes, sir.

665
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,640
LASALLE: Looks like
we finally got clearance.

666
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,074
               Hopefully. Better
                late than never.

667
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,677
I'll download you on the way.
I got a vehicle.

668
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,683
SEBASTIAN: I still
don't know why we're here

669
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,251
or why we're wearing
protective gear.

670
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,919
           P.O. Campbell's blood
 particulates could be anywhere.

671
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,321
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, but the area's
     already been cleared.

672
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,956
        What we need to be doing
         is testing the infected

673
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,724
       for resistant antibodies.

674
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,960
   This is our jurisdiction,
          Agent Lund,

675
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:45,195
                      not yours.

676
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:48,666
        There a problem?
     No. Everything's good.

677
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,134
       LIN: All right. Check for
          residual contamination

678
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,735
 out here, we'll check inside.

679
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,737
           Let's go.

680
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,084
           (panting)

681
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,129
             Crap.

682
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,405
 We think the biological attack
  was really just a diversion

683
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,274
 to get the operatives on base.

684
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:32,409
           By killing
   the Marine Response Force.

685
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,778
  Because they knew they'd be
   the first ones called in,

686
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,779
           Navy 911.

687
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:36,914
DOWNEY:
Exactly.

688
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:39,349
        But to do what?
    Why go through all this?

689
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,118
          Smokescreen?
Probably.

690
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,986
       Best way to breach
     a highly-secure area:

691
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,722
    create widespread panic.

692
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,190
Commander Lopez's team

693
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:49,493
  was installing secure cables
    to what D.O.D. had hoped

694
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,495
     would become the first
     ship activation center

695
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:54,031
east of San Diego.
        Ship activation?

696
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,033
     You have to understand
      how Navy ships work.

697
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,801
     They're basically just
    floating hunks of metal

698
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,369
    until they're programmed
         into warships.

699
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,805
    <i> It's a highly classified</i>
           <i> procedure,</i>

700
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,308
   and the hope was this base
    could expand our reach.

701
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,776
   The more ships activated,

702
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,444
      the more the Chinese
     have to contend with.

703
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:08,812
They don't want that to happen.

704
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,748
   At all costs, apparently.

705
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,049
     So what do they want?

706
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:13,951
   How do they expect to stop
        the programming?

707
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:16,053
 Steal the ship activation CPU

708
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,021
and all the stored intel.

709
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,357
     Make D.O.D. lose faith
        in Belle Chasse.

00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,037
      Hands out the window, now.

730
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,908
Do it now!

731
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,443
Outside the window,
slow!

732
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,548
                       (gagging)

733
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,116
          No, no, no.

734
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:51,541
  Understood. Please, though,
  just do everything you can.

735
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,044
  I should have known the moment
     I saw that those operatives

736
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:56,113
   didn't tape up their wrists--
   I don't know how I missed it.

737
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:59,383
 Sebastian, you did your best.
     You-you followed them,

738
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,618
               you engaged them.
         You-you were outgunned.
    That's not what I mean.

739
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,487
 I mean, I knew that they were
    bad guys, it just didn't

740
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:05,255
occur to me that the only reason
      they weren't afraid

741
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,424
     of being infected was
'cause they had been inoculated.

742
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,459
    The antidote was already
        in their system.

743
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,694
          I should've
    figured that out sooner.

744
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,296
Wouldn't have
made any difference.

745
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,431
              They weren't gonna
                 be taken alive.

746
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,633
        They're trained
   to protect state secrets.

747
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,468
                      All right?
             No matter the cost.

748
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,505
                 Sebastian, hey,
           can you duplicate it?

749
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:24,007
   I'm-I'm trying to separate
   the antibodies right now,

750
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,443
        but Wade doesn't
      have that much time.

751
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,246
   Hey, King, Patton may have
        found something

752
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,948
   off the activation CPU...

753
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,282
  I don't care about the case
    right now, Christopher.

754
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,418
    It's not about the case,
        it's about Wade.

755
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,553
   We found the CPU hooked up
     to the docking station

756
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,021
    in the operative's van.

757
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,456
     They were uploading it
    to someone while we were

758
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,625
         chasing them.
    Yeah, someone off-site.

759
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,660
 They must've knew they weren't
  getting out of there alive.

760
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,529
     But they still wanted
     to transfer the intel

761
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:46,697
           to whoever
     they were working for,

762
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:48,098
     probably the handler.

763
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,333
Can you trace the signal?

764
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:50,868
   That's why we're calling.

765
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,402
         Tracking down
  the receiver's I.P. address,

766
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,470
vectoring the location.
Stand by.

767
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,638
        Pride, if we can
      find the handler...

768
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,173
     There's a good chance
         he might have

769
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,541
      the antidote on him
        as a precaution.

770
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,109
Got it, sending it now.

771
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,044
                   Alferd Supply
                   in Chalmette.

772
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,546
     We'll meet you there.

773
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:05,349
        (siren wailing)

774
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,197
    NCIS! Get your hands up!

775
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:23,033
  Federal agents! Don't move!

776
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:25,469
              Hey!

777
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,537
                       (panting)

778
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,543
            Cyanide.

779
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,146
             Clear.
             Okay.
  Start searching everywhere.

780
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:38,448
That antidote's
got to be here somewhere.

781
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,450
So we're not
wasting time here.

782
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,185
You are under arrest for murder,

783
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,521
terrorism, espionage.

784
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,789
But I don't care
about any of that.

785
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,758
      All I want is to get
   the antidote to the virus.

786
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,593
       Virus? What virus?

787
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,061
        You do not want
   to mess with me right now,

788
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,329
    do you understand that?

789
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:53,530
My friend is dying
because of you,

790
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,531
        and if you don't
      help me save her...

791
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,466
     I'm not afraid to die.

792
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,769
                      SEBASTIAN:
                             No?

793
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,538
   Not quickly, maybe, but...

794
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,640
       how about slowly?

795
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:07,744
           Painfully,
     like all your victims.

796
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,051
                   You know, uh,
             injecting the baker

797
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:15,719
                   directly with
                    the virus...

798
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,594
 ...that must've made his death
  that much more excruciating.

799
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,430
His brain probably
swelled up immediately,

800
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,565
    lungs filled with blood,
         drowning him,

801
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,567
                    convulsions.

802
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:34,738
       You can't do this.

803
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,706
                        (grunts)

804
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:40,644
            He can't, but I can.

805
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:43,280
            And there's nobody's
                here to stop me.

806
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:45,649
            (grunts)
      No, wait! The table!

807
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,218
The antidote's
under the card table!

808
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,321
            Got it.

809
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:54,624
        All right, get it to the
        base and Loretta. Hurry!

810
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,660
                      Sebastian.

811
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,462
                 Were you really
               gonna inject him?

812
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,630
         For her, yeah.

813
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,799
           Get going.

814
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,604
                  What now?

815
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,172
       Now we're gonna book you.

816
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,507
We got a treasure trove

817
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,375
of incriminating evidence
against you.

818
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:15,545
     Probably the only way
to get out of the death penalty

819
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,714
        is if you admit
   to who you're working for.

820
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,850
    You're not getting that
           out of me.

821
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:21,852
  Well, I don't think it's us
    you got to worry about.

822
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:25,222
              Oh, no, that's NSA
              and DHS territory,

823
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:27,357
  but if my memory serves me,
         Guantanamo...

824
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,825
           (gunshot)

825
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,363
         What the hell?

826
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,298
     Someone just shot him
 through a friggin' brick wall!

827
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,640
          (whispers):
             Okay.

828
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,320
         Bullet casing.

829
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,192
          Still warm.

830
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,228
            Is that .50 caliber?

831
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,831
   Not just any .50 caliber.

832
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,299
Penetrates through a brick wall

833
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,334
without line of sight
and still hits its target?

834
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,771
It's got to be DARPA,
thermal scope, heat seeking.

835
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,640
Must have been another operative

836
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,909
    who wanted to make sure
   that this one didn't talk.

837
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:21,411
      Except I don't think
   the operative was Chinese.

838
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,413
This is U.S. technology, Pride.

839
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:25,482
It's brand-new, too.

840
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:28,652
  Which means whoever did this
 had to be homegrown American.

841
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:37,861
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

842
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,430
                   Knock, knock.

843
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:41,731
                            Hey!
Hey.

844
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,533
                      (chuckles)

845
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,435
                How you feeling?

846
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,738
         That's sort of
   a stupid question, I know.

847
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,807
       I'm sorry. It's--
   I-I don't know how to act

848
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,409
        in situations like this.
              I mean, obviously,

849
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:53,877
                after everything
            you've been through,

850
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,745
   you're not feeling great,
     but at the same time,

851
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,714
    I don't know what I'm...
           Sebastian.

852
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,616
       Just ask me again.

853
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:00,984
        How you feeling?

854
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,919
       I feel like crap.

855
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,890
But I'm alive and I'll take it,
         thanks to you.

856
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,758
  Thanks to me? No, I can't...

857
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,993
Oh, don't even go there.

858
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:12,362
     Pride already told me
         what you did.

859
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:14,297
    Said you saved my life.

860
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,799
           I mean...

861
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,767
      I didn't, you know.

862
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,169
                     Not really.
                  Not by myself.

863
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,570
                 It was sort of,
                like, a group...
           Come here.

864
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,705
    Want to give you a hug.

865
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,709
       Mm.

866
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,777
           Thank you.

867
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:28,979
            Anytime.

868
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:35,385
I'm proud of you,
Sebastian.

869
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:38,855
     You faced your fears.

870
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:42,792
You risked your life
to save others.

871
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,762
        I heard you even
threatened to go a little rogue.

872
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,330
That's what I heard.

873
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,799
     Yeah, well, you know.

874
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,868
  Guess that means I'm finally
     becoming a real agent.

875
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,387
No.

876
00:37:54,388 --> 00:37:56,905
      Means you're finally
       becoming yourself.

877
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,755
                            Hey.

878
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:13,556
              Am I interrupting?

879
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:15,058
              No.

880
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,027
No. What's up?
                    Just thought
              you'd like to know

881
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:18,795
        I checked with the medic
                at Belle Chasse.

882
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,697
          Everyone's recovering.

883
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:24,501
Good. Good.

884
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:27,871
       Kind of a major whirlwind
       last couple of days, huh?

885
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,906
           I still can't believe
       everything that happened.

886
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,742
         And everything
     that almost happened.

887
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,944
      Right? So strange, though.

888
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,513
              All that goes down
                   all the time,

889
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:38,515
               public never even
                 knows about it.

890
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:40,917
      Not easy keeping it
      that way sometimes.

891
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,891
        Something else?

892
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,359
             Yeah.

893
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,861
                    I, uh, got a
             partial fingerprint

894
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:55,498
    on the .50 caliber cartridge
        that killed our handler.

895
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,933
        You get an I.D.?
                             No.

896
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,335
              But I think you'll
          find this interesting.

897
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,937
      Turns out the print
      matches the partial

898
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:04,574
Sebastian lifted off of Garcia's
   detonator you guys found.

899
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:06,976
                            Yep.

900
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:09,012
          Same person
      killed both people.

901
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,983
           But wait.

902
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,019
        If that's true,
    then that would mean...

903
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,521
                 That would mean

904
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,022
      the killer's working
      for Mayor Hamilton,

905
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,457
        which also means

906
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,125
               Hamilton could be
           behind both killings.

907
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:23,526
                     And, if so,

908
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,095
    whatever the good mayor
            is up to

909
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:27,063
is a lot bigger than we thought.

910
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,767
     No wonder he's trying
        to threaten us.

911
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,143
            You're late, Dwayne.

912
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,911
             Thought you weren't
                     gonna show.

913
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:45,048
        Wouldn't want to
   disappoint you, Mr. Mayor.

914
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,417
        Good, I'm glad.

915
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:48,885
          That for me?

916
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,056
             Yeah.

917
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:00,096
       Whoa, wait, wait.
        Wh-What is this?

918
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,701
 I told you I wanted everything
  you had on Garcia's murder.

919
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:05,902
          I remember.

920
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:09,472
        Gloves are off.

921
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,043
          Your words.
