1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,896
<i>Previously on "the rookie"</i>

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,396
I can't just go back
to the way things were.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,396
- Are you breaking up with me?
- I'm sorry.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,936
Blair London, rookie police psychiatrist.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,396
<i>She had leverage on mad dog.</i>

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,566
She's blackmailed one
cop, there may be more.

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,406
Someone is trying to kill
me, and I need to know who.

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,696
I want you to help
me break out of prison.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,996
Jason.

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,997
- Who are you?
- Her boyfriend.

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,496
- And you are?
- Her husband.

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,536
Nolan!

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,036
What's wrong?

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,700
<i>Oscar and Jason just
escaped from prison.</i>

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,226
SWAT says ten-minute warning.
We should get down there.

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,726
Unless you want to sit this one out.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,516
No, I'm good.

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,936
With all due respect, sir,
nobody would fault you.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,236
You're one day back from
being wounded in the line.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,316
Got to get right back on
that horse, officer juarez.

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,446
Especially a man of a certain age.

22
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,276
I would guess getting
shot in your hindquarters

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,616
might make horse riding problematic, sir.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,116
You making fun, officer juarez?

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,746
- Not at all, sir.
- Good.

26
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,456
Still got three months
left in your training.

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,120
It's imperative you stay on my good side.

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,296
You really think Jason
is in the target house?

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,836
Damn sure hope so.

30
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,336
Ci says that he's been
hanging with the occupants.

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,466
Bailey's deployment with
the national guard ends soon.

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,136
It's all I could do to get her to extend

33
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,870
so she stays safe outside the country.

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,830
All right, let's get this done.

35
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,646
Overwatch counts four occupants,

36
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,896
but there could be more.

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,486
Three male, one female.

38
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,566
Photos are being sent to your devices.

39
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,236
These are violent criminals
all looking at three strikes,

40
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,326
so they're not gonna go down easy.

41
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,036
We won't have air support

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,496
given our proximity to the airport

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,456
and overwatch's field
of view is imperfect,

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,876
so let's make sure we
communicate out there.

45
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,286
Any questions?

46
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,166
Yeah, sergeant. Sorry. Lieutenant.

47
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,416
All good.

48
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,666
I'm still getting used to it myself.

49
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,336
Why don't we have a fixed perimeter?

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,506
Our targets have known
associates in the neighborhood.

51
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,086
We don't want them raising the alarm,

52
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,006
so our perimeter will
roll in at the last minute.

53
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,620
We good? Now let's get ready.

54
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,436
Hey.

55
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,606
You up for this?

56
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,266
No shame being in the second wave.

57
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,936
No, I'm good to go, sir.

58
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,460
Ok. Mount up.

59
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,867
Is our boy up yet?

60
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,616
Haven't seen him.

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,280
He was hitting it pretty hard last night.

62
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,080
Cops!

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Go, go, go.

64
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,746
Officers taking fire in
the primary entrance.

65
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,076
One officer down.

66
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,456
We are evacuating through the a side.

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,786
Everyone else hold.

68
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,100
Do not advance through
the primary doorway.

69
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,070
Over here!

70
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,750
Get in.

71
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,986
Runner! I'm going in. Cover me.

72
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,010
Gotcha.

73
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,306
Control, Bradford and chen making entry

74
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,396
bathroom window, east side.

75
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,146
Be advised. Potential blue-on-blue.

76
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,856
Repeat. Blue-on-blue.

77
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,960
- Ready?
- Yep.

78
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,826
7-Adam-15. Foot pursuit.

79
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,890
Female raid suspect heading
south towards bellanca.

80
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,326
No, no, no, no, no!

81
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,836
I need you to back up! Back up!

82
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,336
Ma'am, police.

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,820
I need to commandeer your ride. Thanks.

84
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,676
Sir! Damn it.

85
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,320
I lost sight of her.

86
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,056
Control, this is chen.

87
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,896
We have one suspect in
custody, east bathroom.

88
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,976
We're advancing through the house.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,856
Outside officers be advised,

90
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,106
we are still downrange of fire.

91
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,566
Blue-on-blue. Will
advise when we're clear.

92
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,010
Yeah.

93
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,700
Police! Show me your hands!

94
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,237
On your 6:00.

95
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,760
Cuff him.

96
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,736
I give up.

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,180
Get down! On the floor!

98
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,076
Any sign of Jason?

99
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,300
Negative... we haven't
finished clearing the house yet.

100
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,186
Police! Hands!

101
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,960
Show me your hands!

102
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,606
- Where's Jason?
- I don't know.

103
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,646
You got one shot at
telling us the truth here.

104
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,920
I swear, I-I don't know. I never met him.

105
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,640
Stay down, stay down.

106
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,796
Hey.

107
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,876
Gimme that arm.

108
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,626
Hands.

109
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,126
- You ok?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,466
- Yeah?
- I'm good.

111
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,216
How the hell did you get here before me?

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,990
Work smarter, not harder.

113
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,160
Come on, get up.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,096
Are you sure you're all right?

115
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,106
Yeah, yeah. Like I said, code-4.

116
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,436
7-Adam-15. Fourth suspect in custody.

117
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,936
Code-4.

118
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,146
<i>Copy. House is secure.
All suspects in custody.</i>

119
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,526
<i>No sign of Jason.</i>

120
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,180
Damn it.

121
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,176
I'm just saying it's not a great idea

122
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,426
to show up your to at a workout.

123
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,266
A, I did no such thing.

124
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,726
B, it's my first day in short sleeves.

125
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,856
I got to make sure the
gun show is popping.

126
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,356
I see.

127
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,226
So you're planning on
flaunting your superiority

128
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,856
over the new incoming rookies?

129
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,236
Not at all.

130
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,486
I plan to be a welcoming presence

131
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,070
as a veteran member of the fto program.

132
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,776
What?

133
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,866
A veteran member of the fto program.

134
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,446
You are still a rookie.

135
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,367
You still got to sit in the front row

136
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:01,706
with the other newbies.

137
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,876
Why you got to be such a hater?

138
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,020
It's in the job description.

139
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,376
I'm so nervous.

140
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,166
You nervous?

141
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,877
That's stupid. You don't get

142
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,716
you don't get nervous.

143
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,386
Not getting and not showing
are two different things.

144
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,756
Can't let them smell fear, dude.

145
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,176
They'll eat you alive,

146
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,920
so you got to walk the
walk no matter what.

147
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,897
Why aren't you ready yet, boot?

148
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,476
Roll call starts in ten.

149
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,476
I... we... I am getting ready, sir.

150
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,736
Sergeant, sir... sergeant, sir!

151
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,396
Let me make this easy for you, boot.

152
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,116
Don't bother lacing up.
You don't belong here.

153
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,421
Better to quit now than be
embarrassed out on the street.

154
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,866
- Something funny?
- No, sir.

155
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,706
I got mad respect for
a real-life drill sergeant.

156
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,416
Many aspire, but few
live it, as you so clearly do.

157
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,586
Morning!

158
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,086
Are these the academy's finest?

159
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,716
Negative.

160
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,926
These two are scraped
from the bottom of the barrel.

161
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,926
A fainting goat and a peacock.

162
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,256
Well, welcome to the
crucible, gentlemen.

163
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,760
I look forward to learning your
names if you survive the week.

164
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,026
Hey.

165
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,736
- This doesn't look fun.
- It's not.

166
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,946
The only downside
about making lieutenant

167
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,816
is now I'm in charge of the patrol budget.

168
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,776
And I have two new
rookies starting today

169
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,116
and only one available training officer.

170
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,720
Well, what about smitty?

171
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,916
Anyway, this is why you're here.

172
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,796
I used my new rank, pull some strings,

173
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,756
and got you an interim promotion to p3.

174
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,586
Wow, I... that's very kind, but,

175
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,256
but your goal is to work undercover.

176
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,546
I know.

177
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,556
This is short-term.

178
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,556
Helping me out of a jam.

179
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,686
Hey, I'd owe you.

180
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,306
And this will only
strengthen your position

181
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,186
when a detective slot opens up.

182
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,306
Understood.

183
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,396
I-I'm honored you asked.

184
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,606
I won't let you down.

185
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,630
I know you won't.

186
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,606
Hey.

187
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,366
Sorry to interrupt.

188
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,946
You wanted to see me before roll call?

189
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,286
Officer chen is stepping up

190
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,116
to train one of our new rookies.

191
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,746
Good choice. She had
an excellent teacher.

192
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,496
Well, was it the teacher or the student?

193
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,166
Ok, I don't know what this is,

194
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,586
but I need to finish up the
paperwork before roll call.

195
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,336
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

196
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,506
Seriously, if you need any pointers,

197
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,086
- don't hesitate to ask.
- Thank you.

198
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,216
But I'm very familiar
with your bag of tricks.

199
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,306
I'll be using a more modern
approach to train my rookie.

200
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,426
Cut the crust off his sandwiches,

201
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,226
making them feel supported?

202
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,516
My job is to set him up for success,

203
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,016
not push him to failure.

204
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,306
Care to put money on it?

205
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,226
On what? Who trains a better rookie?

206
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,226
No, thank you.

207
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,250
That's so

208
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,366
what exactly would
the terms of the bet be?

209
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,826
Whose rookie's
best-trained after a month.

210
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,576
Most successes, fewest infractions,

211
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,326
each day's reports
independently verified.

212
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,116
But I understand if you want no part of it.

213
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,126
I mean, I'm a veteran, you're a rookie to.

214
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,246
It's not really a fair contest.

215
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,730
Bring it on.

216
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,546
Hey, over here.

217
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,846
Celina juarez.

218
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,716
Rookies sit in the front row
and only speak when spoken to.

219
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,266
I've been here ten months

220
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,386
and I'm happy to show you the ropes.

221
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,136
Ok. That's awesome. Thank you.

222
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,896
Appreciate it, but I'm good.
I'm only technically a rookie.

223
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,460
Got two years of policing
under my belt back in Texas.

224
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,010
Well, that's... that's... that's amazing.

225
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,816
Good morning and congratulations.

226
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,906
- Welcome to the to team.
- Thank you.

227
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,907
So which one of you gets the ringer?

228
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:27,496
What? Ringer?

229
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,286
Yeah, the tall guy is from Texas pd.

230
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,576
Tim and I met him in the locker room.

231
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,876
Wow, what kind of
hustle are you running?

232
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,086
There's no hustle and he's no ringer.

233
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,376
Cops who transfer from other
states have to be untrained

234
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,086
and retrained from all their bad habits.

235
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,966
Honestly, I'm praying
grey gives me the virgin.

236
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,716
All right.

237
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,886
Good morning. Let's get started.

238
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,096
Detective.

239
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,386
Following up on yesterday's raid,

240
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,976
despite our winning personalities

241
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,186
and fearsome interrogation methods,

242
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,776
detective Lopez and I were unsuccessful

243
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,896
in gaining any further
insight into the whereabouts

244
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,066
of Jason wyler and Oscar hut chin son,

245
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,066
which means two of
the most dangerous men

246
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,486
we have ever arrested are still at large.

247
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,656
Now, luckily, the FBI
and the U.S. marshals

248
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,286
are both fully engaged in the hunt.

249
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,246
Given our continued fallout

250
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,546
from the mess Monica
and Blair London created,

251
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,426
Ada Wesley evers has been
assigned here temporarily

252
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,756
to make sure we're flying right.

253
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,216
Good morning.

254
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,096
I understand your
reactions, but it is vital

255
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,716
that law enforcement show the public

256
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,766
that we are taking this
corruption scandal seriously.

257
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,306
So while I'm not here to judge you,

258
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,476
I do have a mandate from the da's office

259
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,516
to review arrest reports and
ensure their completeness

260
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,016
and viability.

261
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,476
- Is that it?
- That's it.

262
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,146
Thank you, Wesley.

263
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,106
And if that wasn't enough,

264
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,026
we have two new rookies starting today.

265
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,486
Stand, state your name
and your badge numbers.

266
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,496
Hi, I'm... I'm Seth Ridley.

267
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,166
Badge number 6514... 651407.

268
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,246
Howdy.

269
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,876
Miles penn, badge number 653013.

270
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,506
Two-year veteran of
the sugar land, Texas

271
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,336
police department.

272
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,046
I've known I was destined
for greatness my whole life.

273
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,466
But I wasn't gonna find it in a small town,

274
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,966
so I came to Hollywood.

275
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,976
Officer penn.

276
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,056
Did I ask for an editorial comment?

277
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,476
No, sir. That was free of charge.

278
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,016
Well, thank you.

279
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,186
Keep your comments to yourself, son.

280
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,896
Or you'll be finding greatness elsewhere.

281
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,396
Am I clear?

282
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,816
Yes, sir.

283
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,196
Now, you both earned
the right to be here,

284
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,286
but you have to prove yourself to stay.

285
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,406
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

286
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,826
Good. Officer penn, you're
assigned to sergeant Bradford.

287
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,786
Officer Ridley, you'll be
riding with officer chen.

288
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,900
That's it. Be safe out there.

289
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,940
Just as I expected. You got the ringer.

290
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,296
- Hi.
- Hey.

291
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,546
Hi. This is gonna be a
pleasure, officer chen.

292
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,176
Nice to meet you. Let's save all that

293
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,216
until you get the war bags and
we set up our shop, all right?

294
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,720
- All right. Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

295
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,556
Is it too late to ask for a to swap?

296
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,226
Get your eyes off officer chen, Texas.

297
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,396
You're not fit to breathe the same air.

298
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,066
Go get us set up.

299
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,017
After all the peacocking you've displayed,

300
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,606
I'm expecting perfection.

301
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,190
I'll be grading you on a serious curve.

302
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,236
- What?
- Nothing.

303
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,430
I'm just liking my chances right now.

304
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,536
I heard you got booed in roll call.

305
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,537
Who am I hurting?

306
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:17,746
That's fine. I can take it.

307
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,376
And having my wife beat up the people

308
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,626
that are mean to me isn't
gonna win me any fans.

309
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,010
I'm just saying, I'll cut a bitch.

310
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,626
Nice of Metro to let
you use the liaison office.

311
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,256
Yeah, I need the privacy.

312
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,136
I still need to finish
reviewing the final recordings

313
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,426
of Blair London's therapy sessions.

314
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,756
So creepy.

315
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,386
Yeah, tell me about it.

316
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,386
All I feel is dirty listening
to everybody's secrets.

317
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,686
Especially when most are only guilty

318
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,230
of being humans in emotional distress.

319
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,106
Hey.

320
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,566
Any news on Monica?

321
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,750
Not since she evaded Interpol in Bolivia.

322
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,236
Why did you make me wait
so long to wear short sleeves?

323
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,366
Aaron got his way
earlier in his rookie year.

324
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,956
You had to earn 'em.

325
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,706
How is Aaron doing over
in north Hollywood, anyway?

326
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,956
He's settling in.

327
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,166
Happy that no one at the station

328
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,666
knows he was a patient of Blair's.

329
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,706
God, this is so freeing.

330
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,466
And clearly distracting.

331
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,966
Perhaps I need to reverse the privilege.

332
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,820
No, no. I-I've celebrated enough.

333
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,080
Whoa. On the right.

334
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,316
7-Adam-15.

335
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,856
Possible disturbance
at El adobe pharmacy.

336
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,170
Code-6 to investigate.

337
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,996
Come on, come on! Hurry!

338
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,496
I-I'm going as fast as I can.

339
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,666
7-Adam-15. We have a 211 armed.

340
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,416
Send backup.

341
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,520
Ready?

342
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,176
What are these back here? These oxys?

343
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,346
The big one, the big ones.

344
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,506
Powerful stuff, come on, powerful stuff.

345
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,636
Hurry!

346
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,926
Go, go, go, go!

347
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,960
You want to get shot today?

348
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,247
Nolan?

349
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:27,360
I'm good! Go!

350
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,070
- Get out of the car!
- My god!

351
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,346
Control, suspect just shot a victim

352
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,886
and fled north on
Kingsley in a gray vehicle.

353
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,766
Partial plate, Edward 2-3-9.

354
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,766
I need an ra for a
30-year-old male victim,

355
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,056
single GSW to the chest.

356
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,330
I got it. Just breathe.

357
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,486
It's very simple.

358
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,736
You know, my job is to
set you up for success.

359
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,406
But things move way
too fast out on the street

360
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,986
for me to coddle you. Yeah?

361
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,036
Yeah. I understand.

362
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,286
Just consider me like your sponge.

363
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,416
I'm eager to absorb all your knowledge.

364
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,916
<i>All units, be on the
lookout for a gray vehicle.</i>

365
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,746
<i>Partial license plate, Edward 2-3-9.</i>

366
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,916
<i>Suspect is white male,
black shirt, brown shirt,</i>

367
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,416
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

368
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,756
<i>Shots were fired, at least one victim.</i>

369
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,506
<i>Unknown condition.</i>

370
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,756
Ok.

371
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,280
Officer Ridley, what's our follow-up?

372
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,846
Don't you want to
know distance of travel?

373
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,847
The time element.

374
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:24,436
- Right.
- Yeah?

375
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,936
Control, what is our
dot and time element?

376
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,106
- <i>- Six minutes ago.
- South on garmond.</i>

377
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,026
Which means he's
headed away from us.

378
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,396
No, garmond is north of us,

379
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,526
which means he's
coming in our direction.

380
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,446
Good. And he's probably
headed towards the freeway.

381
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,026
But the traffic's heavy
this time of morning,

382
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,116
so if we hustle... We
might just catch up to him.

383
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,640
You want to hit the lights?

384
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,626
Do y'all have license plate readers?

385
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,796
I assume you do, big city like this.

386
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,756
Yeah, we do. Where you going with this?

387
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,466
I'm plugging in the partial.

388
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,410
Request a real-time
search of this neighborhood.

389
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,966
It's ok, baby. You're gonna be ok.

390
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,226
My god, our daughter. She's at school.

391
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,227
Westside charter.

392
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,476
It's ok, it's ok.

393
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,766
Officer juarez and I will go pick her up

394
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,056
- and bring her to you, ok?
- Thank you.

395
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,670
- Her name is Nikki.
- Nikki. Ok.

396
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,316
- How bad?
- Bad.

397
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,566
Shot in the chest, pulse is spotty.

398
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,576
Something bothering you?

399
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,786
I just... there was a
moment inside the pharmacy

400
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,456
where I might have had
the shot, but I didn't take it.

401
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,826
You think this citizen
catching a bullet outside

402
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,166
is your fault?

403
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,286
No, I just couldn't tell if

404
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,876
if my background was clear,

405
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,916
and then it turns out it wasn't.

406
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,506
You didn't have confidence
you could make the shot?

407
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,506
No, sir.

408
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,926
I'm saying I wasn't
confident I had a clean shot,

409
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,716
and it turned out I was right.

410
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,636
Look, Nolan, we're in the
split-second decision business.

411
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,386
It's no use second-guessing

412
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,806
until we review the body cam footage.

413
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,460
Yes, sir.

414
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,066
You ready to go?

415
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,486
Yeah.

416
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,026
We need to pick up
their daughter on the way.

417
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,696
<i>Thanks, Dr. London.</i>

418
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,026
<i>It feels good to finally be
able to unburden myself.</i>

419
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,446
<i>I'll see you next week.</i>

420
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,616
Ok. No incriminating information.

421
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,916
Cleared.

422
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,166
<i>I had that dream again, doc.</i>

423
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,706
<i>It was even hotter this time.</i>

424
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,666
<i>The things she did to me.</i>

425
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,376
<i>Seriously, this is becoming a problem.</i>

426
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,416
<i>I mean, how am I supposed
to work next to Angela Lopez</i>

427
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,480
<i>when all I can think about
is how much I want to...</i>

428
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,056
Well, I think it's best if
we let your mom explain.

429
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,976
But what kind of accident?

430
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,726
Is my dad gonna be ok?

431
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,106
We hope so.

432
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,896
He has the very best doctors,

433
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,526
and we're going to be at the
hospital in just a few minutes.

434
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,236
All right?

435
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,736
Ok.

436
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,906
<i>All units, 211 suspect plates recorded</i>

437
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,496
<i>heading west, 2100 block
of Lincoln ten minutes ago,</i>

438
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,876
<i>but the vehicle did not pass
through the next intersection.</i>

439
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,126
That's just around the corner.

440
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,336
There's an alley on Lincoln.

441
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,480
Maybe he ditched the car down there.

442
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,176
My god. There it is.

443
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,716
Ok, focus, officer Ridley.

444
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,306
Do I park here or pull in closer?

445
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,886
We, we park here.

446
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,346
Why?

447
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,886
Because we can't see if the suspect

448
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,016
is in the vehicle or not,

449
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,016
so it's safer to approach on foot.

450
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,540
Correct.

451
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,606
7-Adam-19, I have eyes
on the suspect vehicle.

452
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,946
West Side of the alley,
2100 block of Lincoln.

453
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,406
Show us code-6 to
investigate. Send backup.

454
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,510
<i>- Copy that, 7-Adam-19.
- Be careful.</i>

455
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,746
All right. Tell me how we approach.

456
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,416
We have our weapons drawn,
we approach with caution,

457
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,996
we try to call out the driver.

458
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,336
If he does not respond,

459
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,586
then we can get a little bit closer.

460
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,506
Always make sure we
have an exit route available.

461
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,626
And we'll check the trunk on the way up.

462
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,636
It's an SUV. There is no trunk.

463
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,136
Don't just parrot
academy training, all right?

464
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,136
This is the real world.

465
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,136
Right. Yes, ma'am.

466
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
All right.

467
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,516
Control, can we make sure
that nobody comes northbound

468
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,846
to this alley in case there's fire?

469
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,266
<i>Copy that, 7-Adam-19.</i>

470
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,516
That's a good call.

471
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,646
Driver! This is the police!

472
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,840
Roll down your window
and show me your hands!

473
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,276
Show me your hands!

474
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,156
Do it now!

475
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,656
Watch your... watch your muzzle.

476
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,866
Sorry, sorry.

477
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,850
- Go this way.
- Ok.

478
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,666
I see the suspect.

479
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,666
Show me your hands!

480
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,956
He looks dead.

481
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,376
We can't know for sure.

482
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,966
Come this side.

483
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,756
I'm gonna open the door.

484
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,677
You grab his shoulders,
pull them out on three.

485
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,030
- Ok?
- Ok.

486
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,910
One, two.

487
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,606
Hey, do not get sick.

488
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,896
Ok.

489
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,066
Don't puke on him.

490
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,446
No.

491
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,116
Damn it.

492
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,116
Ridley, you just
contaminated the crime scene.

493
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,906
Sorry.

494
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,616
<i>7-Adam-19, 211 suspect in custody.</i>

495
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,116
<i>We need ra for possible od.</i>

496
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,286
Must have been jonesing for a fix

497
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,996
when he robbed the pharmacy.

498
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,796
Pulled over to dope up as
soon as he thought it was safe.

499
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,586
On the bright side, taxpayers
save millions if he kicks it.

500
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,546
We never root for a
suspect to die, officer penn.

501
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,046
Yeah, totally.

502
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,806
I-I'm just saying

503
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,370
finally, a little action of our own.

504
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,476
Reported stolen early this morning.

505
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,266
Pull up close and I'll shoot out the tires.

506
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,330
I'm kidding, man.

507
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,350
Ooh, that hurt.

508
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,746
Ok, what... police! Show me your hands!

509
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,666
Show me your damn hands!

510
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,956
He's running!

511
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,730
Get down! Show me your hands!

512
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,426
You should have waited.

513
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,756
That was all bad, Texas.

514
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,176
Strike one, you jumped out the car

515
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,386
while I was trying to communicate.

516
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,466
What if I was trying to tell you

517
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,556
I saw a gun or a second suspect?

518
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,266
Strike two, you ran out
in front of my field of fire,

519
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,396
so I couldn't engage even if I had to.

520
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,936
And strike three, by going
to that driver's side alone,

521
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,396
you left an escape route
out the passenger side.

522
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,776
And don't even get me started

523
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,106
on your little "shoot
out the tires" comment.

524
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,566
It is now a permanent part of this case.

525
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,106
That may not sound like much now,

526
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,566
but wait till a civil Liberty
attorney hears about it.

527
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,310
Might be writing this
kid checks for years.

528
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,666
All right, as punishment
for being a cowboy,

529
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,216
you're checking every
vin on that stolen vehicle

530
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,876
to make sure it matches.

531
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,586
That'll take hours, sarge.

532
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,216
It's sergeant Bradford, not sarge.

533
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,177
You're way too eager to get in trouble,

534
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:35,240
so I'm slowing you down.

535
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,176
Back out.

536
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,516
Wait. Why? What is that alarm for?

537
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,016
Back out!

538
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,396
Every department garage
has a geiger counter.

539
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,750
This car we brought in is radioactive.

540
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,816
12 hours ago, a suitcase nuke
arrived on a naval cargo ship

541
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,356
from Eastern Europe.

542
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,566
It's a cold war relic from Ukraine

543
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,616
that got turned over for demolition.

544
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,486
A secure convoy was
meant to take it to Oklahoma

545
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,406
to be decommissioned,
but the nuke went missing

546
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,906
at the port sometime before dawn.

547
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,326
How the hell does that happen?

548
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,496
That's what we've
been desperately trying

549
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,916
to figure out, along with who took it

550
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,456
and what the hell they're
planning on doing with it.

551
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,206
And you didn't think to inform the LAPD?

552
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,666
There's been a lot of
pressure to keep this quiet,

553
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,667
not to panic people.

554
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:10,046
I argued against it,

555
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,830
but the decision was
made up the food chain.

556
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,257
You're with us.

557
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:16,846
Go study your rook book.

558
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,700
Close that.

559
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,936
A battlefield nuke was stolen
from the port this morning.

560
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,856
And the og backpack
runs about 80 pounds,

561
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,726
making it highly mobile.

562
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,476
What do you know about
the stolen car's owner?

563
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,276
Paul scoville, 31, rent-a-cop at the port.

564
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,736
Recently divorced.

565
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,236
I assume money problems,

566
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,616
but I can't confirm
till I pull his financials.

567
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,366
Any idea where he is now?

568
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,656
No. Called his house, his
cell, haven't heard back.

569
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,946
But I just found out
he's a person of interest

570
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,656
five seconds ago.

571
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,956
I'll have the office work on the warrants.

572
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,956
- Known associates, too?
- Absolutely.

573
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,286
We are gonna piggyback
the whole menu on this.

574
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,706
Home, phone, storage lockers, po boxes,

575
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,456
and the same for all known associates.

576
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,626
Anyone we can establish
a clear nexus with.

577
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,886
I'll mobilize hrt.

578
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,887
Can you get Metro
and SWAT up to speed?

579
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,296
- Of course.
- Good.

580
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,886
We're gonna need to
get ready and gear up,

581
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,966
because when it is time to move,

582
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,386
we are gonna need to move fast.

583
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,830
Copy.

584
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,976
Hey.

585
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,316
They officially called
time of death at 1329.

586
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,646
Right.

587
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,106
Write that down.

588
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,486
And they still have to do an autopsy,

589
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,276
but it seems pretty clear
it was an overdose, so

590
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,826
listen, about earlier.

591
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,286
No, look, I get it.

592
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,656
It's your first dead body.

593
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,206
All those fluids, it got to you.

594
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,286
But we have to protect the scene.

595
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,246
Yeah, no, I... I

596
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,416
yes, we got to protect the scene,

597
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,207
but it's not that simple.

598
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:31,796
I... this is not my first od.

599
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,466
I had this girlfriend back
in junior year of high school,

600
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,756
and I found her after prom

601
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,466
in a bathroom at Rory hatcher's house.

602
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,726
And... She had her eyes
rolled back, you know,

603
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,096
and

604
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,606
she wasn't breathing,
so I tried to give her cpr,

605
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,436
but

606
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,316
I couldn't get the taste of
her sick out of her mouth

607
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,736
for like two days.

608
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,340
And I can still taste it if I...

609
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,776
I

610
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,036
I wasn't being a delicate
flower out there today, ok?

611
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,446
It all just came rushing back.

612
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,826
And I promise it's not
gonna happen again.

613
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,956
Seth, that's awful.

614
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,626
I'm sorry that happened to you.

615
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,706
But in this job, we have to
separate from the personal.

616
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,296
It's the hardest thing we have to do.

617
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,626
Because if we lose control,
bad things happen, right?

618
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,030
Understood.

619
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,490
Right over here.

620
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,976
Any news?

621
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,356
Husband died on the
table a few minutes ago.

622
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,106
She doesn't know yet.

623
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,356
Man, that's rough. Why
haven't they told her?

624
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,606
We asked them to wait a beat.

625
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,396
We need to take a statement,

626
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,820
and she'll be in no condition
to give us one when she knows.

627
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,986
I mean, it just seems wrong, you know,

628
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,536
to keep the news from her.

629
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,996
Yeah, and waiting another ten minutes

630
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,390
isn't gonna make it any worse.

631
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,996
It's grey. Yes, sir.

632
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,586
<i>I'm here with special agent garza.</i>

633
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,796
We have a situation
that's not for broadcast.

634
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,546
A battlefield nuke is at large.

635
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,086
<i>Small yield, but high dispersal.</i>

636
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,087
<i>We need you and officer juarez</i>

637
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:00,386
to go put eyes on a suspect's house

638
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,006
while FBI and SWAT mobilize.

639
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,216
<i>Address to your box.</i>

640
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,136
Yes, sirs. On it.

641
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,660
- What's happening?
- Nothing good.

642
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,566
Detective Graham, right?

643
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,026
Yes, sir.

644
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,470
You're the hall monitor
from the da's office.

645
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,406
I'm actually thrilled you're here.

646
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,116
Anything you can do to
improve on patrol's paperwork

647
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,196
is a lifesaver.

648
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,246
You work with my wife, Angela Lopez.

649
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,666
Yeah.

650
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,956
She's amazing.

651
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,957
Sure you already know that.

652
00:27:33,981 --> 00:27:35,876
Yeah, I do.

653
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,126
I have to admit I didn't
think you guys would last.

654
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,900
I always thought she'd end up with a cop.

655
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,596
And yet here we are,
happily married, two kids.

656
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,660
Well, you must be doing something right.

657
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,340
A little more.

658
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,880
Right there. Perfect.

659
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,866
How you doing?

660
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,206
I'm fine.

661
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,746
If you want to talk
about anything... I don't.

662
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,046
I'm just saying if it was me,

663
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,296
I'd be beating myself
up, wondering if there was

664
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,586
anything I could have done differently

665
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,587
inside the pharmacy.

666
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:22,756
And I said I'm good.

667
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,096
Right, no. Yeah, you did.

668
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,056
But if I was going
through that self-doubt,

669
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,096
what would you say to
me as my training officer?

670
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,516
Well, I would say that the
whole benefit of experience

671
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,106
is to learn from each incident,

672
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,196
both victories and mistakes.

673
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,276
So if the situation ever happens again,

674
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,866
it'll be a win.

675
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,930
It's a brutal job to
have to learn as you go.

676
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,626
Contact.

677
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,836
It appears there's
been a little falling out

678
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,996
between nuclear thieves.

679
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,966
We have to intervene, right?

680
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,216
Even though we're
just meant to observe?

681
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,217
Well, it depends.

682
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,676
As harsh as it may sound,

683
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,926
if that man is dead,
he's just evidence now.

684
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,426
Ok, well, what if he's alive

685
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,660
and needs help and
we don't do anything?

686
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,516
What's the plan?

687
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,026
Well, we can't go in there guns blazing.

688
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,236
We need those guys alive
in case the nuke isn't here.

689
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,486
So stealth and surprise.

690
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,600
What are you wearing
under that uniform?

691
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,746
Hello? I need your help.

692
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,166
Please.

693
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,536
- What?
- I lost my dog.

694
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,166
We were jogging.

695
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,456
He pulled the leash out of my hand.

696
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,586
It's a brown labradoodle.
Have you seen him?

697
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,086
No.

698
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,176
Can I... can I check your backyard

699
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,006
just to make sure he
didn't get back there?

700
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,756
No. I'm sorry.

701
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,200
Police! Show me your hands.

702
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,356
We got two in custody.
Scoville's in the tub.

703
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,500
He's still breathing, but he
needs an ambulance asap.

704
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,406
Nothing, boss.

705
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,076
There are no traces of
radiation in this house,

706
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,077
so the nuke isn't here.

707
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:14,286
It never was.

708
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,786
So we are gonna have ourselves

709
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,496
a long, hard conversation.

710
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,536
<i>You're wasting your breath.</i>

711
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,836
I ain't talking.

712
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,796
That's fine.

713
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,336
Better you listen for the moment anyway,

714
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,716
because what you choose to do next

715
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,426
will decide the rest of your life.

716
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:32,886
Paul scoville is clinging to
his life at Saint Stephens.

717
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,226
So as of this moment,

718
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,806
there's still a path to immunity for you.

719
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,856
We can hang the charges on your crew,

720
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,436
give you a golden ticket to a new life.

721
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,656
But we need names and
a location for the device.

722
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,970
I told you... shut up!

723
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,616
You have literally five minutes to decide

724
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,036
if you are gonna be part of the solution

725
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,230
or go to prison as a domestic terrorist.

726
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,416
You think he'll flip on his guys?

727
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,860
He has to. There's no other option.

728
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,610
How's it going with your cowboy?

729
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,136
Great. How's the virgin?

730
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,580
Great.

731
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,210
Celina's doing great,
too. Thank you for asking.

732
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,276
Is it always this intense?

733
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,476
No.

734
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,696
Well, kind of.

735
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,696
That's the point, though, right?

736
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,906
If you prove yourself here,
you know that you're the best.

737
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,036
I... it's not really like that.

738
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,310
For me, I... I... I just
want to help people.

739
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,706
Aries, pisces?

740
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,796
- Yeah.
- How did... how'd you know?

741
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,690
Well, it's a... it's a gift.

742
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,386
Everything ok?

743
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,886
What?

744
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,926
No, just you have a
pained look on your face.

745
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,976
Just checking to make sure

746
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,096
you're not having a heart attack.

747
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,436
No, no, no. No, I'm fine.

748
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,146
I'm fine.

749
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,226
It's just I'm an officer of the court.

750
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,476
I can't violate the confidentiality

751
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,477
that I've been entrusted with.

752
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:08,486
And that's the

753
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,276
the cornerstone of the
legal profession, really.

754
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,946
No matter how much you
want to unknow what you know,

755
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,116
you can't, it's just there, always.

756
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,196
Every time you close your eyes.

757
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,996
Hey, they need you in interrogation.

758
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,326
Nuclear guy's ready to talk,

759
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,327
but they need you to sign off on the deal.

760
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:24,650
Right.

761
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,126
Crew leader's Marcus Leonard.

762
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,676
He's holed up in a rental in west la

763
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,886
with Evan ardle and leshawn wilkes.

764
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,846
That's where the nuke is.

765
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,306
We're waiting to rendezvous
with a buyer in the desert.

766
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,846
Outside of Vegas.

767
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,356
But you better hurry.

768
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,750
They're on the move
in less than an hour.

769
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,946
Eyes are in the sky. Radio
on scrambled channel.

770
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,286
Be advised, license
plate camera captured

771
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,206
suspect vehicle heading east

772
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,036
on Wilshire boulevard one minute ago.

773
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,730
That's east on Wilshire boulevard.

774
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,376
How come I got to sit next to nuke?

775
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,466
It doesn't matter who sits closest.

776
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,176
Radiation is the same for all of us.

777
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,177
Minor.

778
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,006
I still don't like it.

779
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,886
$10 million payday's gonna
get you past that real quick.

780
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,000
Can I get mine in crypto?

781
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,606
Heads up.

782
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,726
Suspect vehicle spotted
west on Wilshire boulevard

783
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,776
heading for the freeway.

784
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,236
7-Adam-100 two blocks away,
heading northwest on olive.

785
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,526
What are our rules of engagement?

786
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,946
<i>Don't shoot the nuke.</i>

787
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,616
7-Adam-19, five blocks away,
heading south on figueroa.

788
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,076
This seems unreal. Was
your first day like this?

789
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,746
No, I saved my tos life

790
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,076
after he got shot during a firefight.

791
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,246
This is a walk in the park.

792
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,440
All right, 7-Adam-15
on an intercept course.

793
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,450
- There he is.
- There he is.

794
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,240
We're busted. Get
us the hell out of here.

795
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,450
Hey, secure that thing!

796
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,670
<i>FBI unit 1, joining the pursuit.</i>

797
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,526
Watch out for that car.

798
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,670
I see it.

799
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,536
Ok, we're turning here on hope street.

800
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,826
Go, e, come on!

801
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,746
<i>7-Adam-15, two more units</i>

802
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,576
<i>attaching to pursuit three blocks out.</i>

803
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,270
Suspect vehicle heading
east, entering lower grand.

804
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,546
I know we're not supposed
to shoot the device,

805
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,006
but how do you feel
about us crashing into it?

806
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,806
And I'm the cowboy?

807
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,766
Well, in theory, it's stable
enough for an outside impact,

808
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,016
but the thing's 60 years old, so

809
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,096
yeah, that... that sounds like a no.

810
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,710
Hang on.

811
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,690
Bail out!

812
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,527
Bring the nuke.

813
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,340
No way.

814
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,760
Three shooters.

815
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,536
Cover us.

816
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Go!

817
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,560
Two shooters running off.

818
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,716
- Get up!
- Got him, got him.

819
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,740
Shooter down.

820
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,756
Penn, slow down!

821
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,240
Clear the truck.

822
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,566
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

823
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,760
Get down, get down.

824
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,680
Go.

825
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,416
Stay down.

826
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,996
Ridley, pull her in.

827
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,020
I got you cover fire.

828
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,690
Reload.

829
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,806
Why ain't they shooting at us?

830
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,306
It's a nuke.

831
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,610
They don't want to hit the nuke.

832
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,600
Officer down.

833
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,480
Hey, here. Hold on.

834
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,496
7-Adam-15, shots fired.

835
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,400
We have an officer down,
requesting ra at my location.

836
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,836
Get up.

837
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,046
Get up!

838
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,756
The hell you doing?

839
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,846
Shut up.

840
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,847
Back off!

841
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,726
Back off or I'll blow us all up!

842
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,000
You want to be a cowboy?
I will level this place!

843
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,520
On your knees now!

844
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,456
Nice shot, officer Nolan.

845
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,836
Thank you, sir.

846
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,900
Code-4, all suspects in custody.

847
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,556
Man, that

848
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,676
you think tomorrow's
gonna be any quieter?

849
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,910
Not now that you jinxed it.

850
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,516
Looks like you survived the day, boot.

851
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,856
Yeah, sir. Sergeant, sir.

852
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,276
Any blemishes? Don't lie to me.

853
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,436
I will find out.

854
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,066
No, just a small incident

855
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,906
when officer chen and I
found the carjacker od'ed,

856
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,036
I just puked in the vehicle.

857
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,616
Dude.

858
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,036
I wouldn't be so quick
to judge, officer penn.

859
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,616
You almost got a blue page

860
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,706
for your reckless behavior this morning.

861
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,126
Yes, sir.

862
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,536
I truly appreciate your leniency.

863
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,046
Don't mistake it for kindness.

864
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,586
You remain on very thin ice.

865
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,716
Yes, sir. See you tomorrow.

866
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,796
Unfortunately. Try to suck less.

867
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,990
Will do.

868
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,056
How's lieutenant life treating you?

869
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,596
I love the pay bump.

870
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,016
Just wish it came under
better circumstances.

871
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,566
What do you mean?

872
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,436
I just can't help but to feel guilty

873
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,736
because I got rewarded

874
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,236
for exposing the corruption scandal.

875
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,406
Lot of cops got fired.

876
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,406
Yeah, well, they deserved it.

877
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,576
So you deserve this promotion

878
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,946
no matter how it came about, ok?

879
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,826
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

880
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,366
Just doesn't seem right.

881
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,826
We saved the city,

882
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,916
and our reward is
sitting in rush hour traffic.

883
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,110
Got to love la.

884
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,676
Hey.

885
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,926
Heard your guy puked
all over a crime scene.

886
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,926
Well, at least he didn't
light his duty manual on fire

887
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,766
and throw it out the window.

888
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,976
Shoot out the tires?

889
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,596
He's a little rough around
the edges, but it's day one.

890
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,597
I'll get him under control.

891
00:39:40,621 --> 00:39:42,106
Likewise.

892
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,186
So wait, since they both screwed up

893
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,196
yeah, I guess it's a draw.

894
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,776
Tomorrow's a new day.

895
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,430
Yes, it is.

896
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,076
Well, I will see you tomorrow.

897
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,996
Look forward to it.

898
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,190
Good night.

899
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,136
What?

900
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,686
It's nothing.

901
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,646
If you want to fool around, just ask.

902
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,647
No.

903
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:28,146
I mean, of course I do.

904
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,446
It's just... it's just what?

905
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,486
You're happy, right?

906
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,906
In this moment, I'm sleepy

907
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,616
and a little concerned about
whatever this conversation is.

908
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,626
But in general, yes, I'm very happy.

909
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,730
Ok, good.

910
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,626
So do you want to fool around or not?

911
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,860
I mean, if you're offering.

912
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,726
Hey, it's me.

913
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,526
It's like 5:00 in the
morning where you are,

914
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,106
so I'm glad you didn't pick up.

915
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,316
Miss you.

916
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,736
Hard day.

917
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,576
Would have been nice to snuggle up,

918
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,866
have you tell me I did a good job.

919
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,786
Anyway, just got home.

920
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,786
Hope you're having a
good time being a soldier.

921
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,940
I love you.

922
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,830
You did a good job today.

923
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Yeah, that was weird.

924
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,700
<i>Damn it.</i>
