1
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:10,010
[Jeffrey] Four civilians are going
to space

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,763
and they will kick the doors open
for the rest of us.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,641
Every person who's going
to join this mission

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,020
has to be able to deliver a very powerful
and inspiring story.

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,440
Went upstairs after the phone call,
though, and told my wife,

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,233
"I think I'm going to ride a rocket."

7
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,985
And she just, "What?"

8
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,948
[Erin] I don't think I'll think about
the worldly impact

9
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:36,036
this mission is going to have
until Chris is back on the ground.

10
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,580
I'm, like, "Why would they choose me?"

11
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,497
Look at that!

12
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,168
Look, my dad instilled this idea in me
that I could do anything.

13
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,756
At age ten I was having pain in my knee.

14
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,967
[Colleen] Hayley was diagnosed
with bone cancer.

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,802
Having cancer made me who I am.

16
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,973
I'm getting to show them what their life
can look like after cancer.

17
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,975
If I can do it, you can definitely do it.

18
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,311
I'm commander of Inspiration4.

19
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:05,899
No matter what I'm a father first and that
comes with a great deal of responsibility.

20
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,233
What is the speed?

21
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,027
Seventeen and a half
thousand miles an hour.

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,028
Oh, wow!

23
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,279
It's getting real.

24
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,824
[Chris] They put us through the ringer
pretty quick.

25
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,035
[Hayley] We've worked so hard.

26
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:17,952
<i>Yes!</i>

27
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,287
[Sian] <i>Wow!</i>

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,293
The two times where you're the most
worried is at launch and reentry.

29
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,003
[Jared] The risk is not zero.

30
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,963
We're basically going
through a controlled explosion.

31
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,090
We all feel really ready.

32
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,258
Let's do this.

33
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,803
There's no doubt in my mind that we're
going to have a successful mission.

34
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,836
[Hayley] We left Hawthorne yesterday.

35
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,464
And then we all reconvened
with the jets in Pensacola,

36
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,301
and then this morning
we had a beautiful sunrise flight out.

37
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,681
So we just arrived
to Kennedy Space Center,

38
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,559
and this is the place where
we're gonna launch in just a few days.

39
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,103
Good way to get
to Kennedy Space Center, right?

40
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,062
No better way.

41
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,152
I know that we're gonna be really busy
in the next six days leading up to launch.

42
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,613
We've got some medical checkouts.
We're doing some research.

43
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,199
We're doing some media and studying.

44
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,205
I thought launch week I'd be nervous,
but I'm really not at all.

45
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,457
I think we're just ready.

46
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,879
[Colleen] I'm still into today,

47
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,422
and today's a great day.

48
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:56,259
I know looking ahead in six days,
I'm going to feel very differently,

49
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:00,597
but right now I'm not thinking about
anything else but how exciting it is.

50
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,977
[Jared] Some of the biggest milestones
that we're gonna have coming up is, like,

51
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,396
there's dry dress,
which is basically the dress rehearsal.

52
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,523
Everybody's involved.

53
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,484
Mission control, launch directors,
the crew, the families.

54
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,571
Like everybody is going through
a simulation of exactly what it will be,

55
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,031
including us getting strapped in Dragon.

56
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,076
And then you get your L minus 1,
the last day before launch.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,829
We'll brief the public as to a little bit
more specifics on our mission.

58
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,916
Last moment to spend with family.

59
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,126
And then we wake up the next day,
and we go to space.

60
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,171
[theme music]

61
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,291
[Haley] For right now, let's talk through
what the week will look like.

62
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:16,297
We did decide a 8:00 p.m. start
of a 12-hour launch window on the 15th

63
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,132
is kind of what we're targeting right now.

64
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,218
Here's your launch time, right there.

65
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,513
And so, we're gonna do the sleep shifts
so that you guys are fully optimized.

66
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,767
Going to sleep at 5:00 a.m.
and waking up at 1:00.

67
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,020
All your hormone levels,
plus the circadian, will line up

68
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,981
so that you guys are
in perfect state for that launch.

69
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,114
[Maddie] So today we're just going to walk
through all these choreography steps

70
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,492
so there's nothing
that pops up and surprises us.

71
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,370
My name is Maddie Kothe. I'm 26 years old,

72
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,164
and I am a Dragon integration engineer
at SpaceX.

73
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:54,168
Hayley and Sian, you guys are
going to go into the elevator first.

74
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,588
For the I4 crew,
I'm also the closeout lead.

75
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:02,010
What the closeout lead means is I'm
in charge of the day-of-launch operations.

76
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,513
Basically, having everything scheduled
minute by minute

77
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,932
to make sure we're gonna hit our T-0 time.

78
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,225
So if you guys wanna go
to each of your stations,

79
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:11,269
we're gonna go through crew warren,

80
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,480
which is like what is in your tablet
and what you're wearing.

81
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,858
And then we ultimately
close the hatch on them,

82
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:21,320
so we're the last people to say
good luck on this amazing adventure.

83
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,448
-You're gonna get--
-Everything's awesome.

84
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,532
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Thanks so much.

85
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,200
Everything's incredible. Thank you.

86
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,618
-Everything's good.
-Oh, yeah.

87
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,412
-Oh, yeah.
-You're welcome.

88
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,052
[man] We are at the
weather decision point

89
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,180
for the upcoming Inspiration4 mission.

90
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,558
So today we'll be stepping in
to look at the weather forecast

91
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,393
across ascent and return.

92
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,646
<i>So, yeah. The thing</i>
<i>that we've been tracking</i>

93
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,398
<i>is that tropical development</i>
<i>off to the east.</i>

94
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,067
<i>Overall, pretty good for that.</i>

95
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,903
<i>Really, not much difference</i>
<i>in the window as you can see.</i>

96
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,279
Thanks, everyone.

97
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,576
Currently right now, the weather's
trending great for not only the launch,

98
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,537
but also for the splashdown and recovery.

99
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,040
We have to not only look
at launch weather,

100
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,126
but also ensure that we'll
have good weather for landing

101
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,128
basically three days from now.

102
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,258
Our launch window is
on the 15th, Wednesday,

103
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,969
between eight o'clock at night
and 1:00 in the morning.

104
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,931
And all the weather models and everything
looks like we're trending

105
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,017
towards the front side of that model
as being the best.

106
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,523
Right now, here, we're getting ready
for what we call dry dress.

107
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,860
Essentially, it's a rehearsal for
what's gonna happen on launch date.

108
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,454
It's a great kind of end-to-end
for not only the crew

109
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,624
but also for the team
that's supporting the crew...

110
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,084
We're a few minutes late.

111
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,378
...and all of mission control.

112
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,593
All stations, CORE, and Dragon,
for awareness, we are a few minutes behind

113
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,804
on side hatch leak checks.

114
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,724
Copy. Mosquito is in the capsule.
Understood.

115
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,480
[Chris] We went through all those
different things that you need to do

116
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,357
to make sure you're going
to be safe and ready for flight.

117
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,193
What are you physically doing
in that moment?

118
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:30,408
This is your last chance to visualize it
before you actually go and do this thing.

119
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,871
Dry dress was absolutely necessary,
to have walked through all those steps.

120
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,166
And it gave us a really good indication
of the timing of everything.

121
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,085
We got to put on our space suits
and sit in our spacecraft,

122
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,589
and it just made us even more hyped
for launch day.

123
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,345
Everyone's phones are on silent.

124
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,097
Except mine.

125
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,849
[Hayley] Yeah, don't miss that call.

126
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,186
[Sian] As I'm about to go
and inspire others, you know,

127
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,731
there's a lot of people who have been
a big influence in my life,

128
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,232
even though they don't know it.

129
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,526
And Michelle Obama is one of them.

130
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,113
And so I just causally said,
"I wish I could talk to her."

131
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,033
And Kidd was like,
"We can make that happen."

132
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,456
You want us all to keep staring at you?

133
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,333
[all laugh]

134
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,089
[cell phone rings]

135
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,633
Okay, here we go.

136
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,969
Hello?

137
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,890
[Michelle] <i>Good afternoon,</i>
<i>this is Michelle Obama</i>

138
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,602
<i>calling for Dr. Proctor</i>
<i>and the Inspiration4 crew.</i>

139
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,688
-<i>Am I on the right line?</i>
-You are on the right line.

140
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,565
Hi, Mrs. Obama.

141
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,943
This is Sian Proctor.

142
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,947
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>
<i>It's so good to hear your voice.</i>

143
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,156
<i>My goodness.</i>

144
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,826
<i>I can't tell you how much</i>
<i>it means to be able</i>

145
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,540
<i>to join you guys on this call the day</i>
<i>before this exciting mission.</i>

146
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,876
<i>I can't imagine what's going</i>
<i>through your minds.</i>

147
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,462
Well, I have my entire crew here
right now with me,

148
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:10,883
but I'm just saying I'm thinking about
how I'm talking to you right now.

149
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,469
And how amazing that is.

150
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,265
[Michelle] <i>You are making history,</i>
<i>and I just want to thank all of you</i>

151
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:22,812
<i>for your courage</i>
<i>and your curiosity and your bravery.</i>

152
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,898
<i>You have everything you need.</i>
<i>You have each other.</i>

153
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:32,947
<i>You guys are representing</i>
<i>what it means to be America.</i>

154
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,448
<i>It is all of us.</i>

155
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,370
<i>Showing courage,</i>
<i>taking risks on behalf of everyone else.</i>

156
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,997
<i>And you all are doing just that.</i>

157
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,001
Right now I want to thank the crew
of Inspiration4 for joining us.

158
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,004
In just a little over 24 hours,
they'll be blasting off

159
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,048
on the first all-civilian mission
to space.

160
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,260
[Sian] We had a very special call today.

161
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:58,431
I was very fortunate that
I could help me and my crew

162
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,975
speak with Michelle Obama today.

163
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,936
And so we had a very nice conversation

164
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,898
that will stay with me
the rest of my life.

165
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,652
[Michelle] <i>I'm grateful to you all,</i>
<i>I'm proud of you all,</i>

166
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,739
<i>I wish you all the very best.</i>

167
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,532
<i>I want you to be safe</i>

168
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,368
<i>and know that we'll be here</i>
<i>praying for you all.</i>

169
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,039
<i>So, thank you. Thank you for allowing me</i>
<i>to spend this time with you.</i>

170
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,476
I know. Isn't that amazing?

171
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,353
This is unreal.

172
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,271
[Sian] It really is.

173
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,273
Look at that, under the moon.

174
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,234
-[Hayley] Amazing.
-[Colleen] I know!

175
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,194
Tomorrow.

176
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,489
My best friend's an astronaut! Oh, my God!

177
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,492
It only took a decade
for that to come true.

178
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,993
Yeah, well...

179
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,496
[Colleen] I'll be fine, too.

180
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,708
-So don't worry.
-[Hayley] I might worry a little.

181
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,088
-[Jared] I'll be back.
-[girl] When?

182
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,589
In, like, three days.

183
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,008
[girl] Daddy?

184
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,135
Is that how you get into the entrance?

185
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,262
[Jared] That's right.
That's how you get into the spacecraft.

186
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,389
You're so smart.

187
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,640
You want to look?

188
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,855
[Sian] It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

189
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,317
Like, it is absolutely gorgeous.

190
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,903
Is it scary, Daddy?

191
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,447
No, it seems like a lot of fun to me.

192
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,286
Snap that one.

193
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,665
-They told me, they said...
-You're going to space in that, Hayley.

194
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,625
Yeah, in 24 hours.

195
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:54,463
I think more of my emotions hit
that night before actual launch day,

196
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:59,301
just because you are seeing
this giant rocket and the Dragon on top,

197
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:04,557
and it was just different
to witness it so close.

198
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,851
-[Jared] Are you getting emotional?
-[Monica] Yeah.

199
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,734
[Jared] It's gonna be good.

200
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,240
-[girl] Mommy.
-[Monica] I know, I'm just scared.

201
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,411
-Shall we?
-Yeah, let's do it.

202
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,912
Come on. We're walking.

203
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,006
[Colleen] You want me
to come jump on your bed?

204
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:42,678
You got to get up early
in the morning to go to space.

205
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,221
I love you guys. Have a good night.

206
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,182
-Bye.
-Sleep well.

207
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,224
Text us when you're awake.

208
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,893
Okay, I will. I'll call you around 11:00.

209
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,774
It is finally September 15th.

210
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,068
3:00 a.m.

211
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,988
I'm about to go to sleep.

212
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,701
And when I wake up,
I'm going to go to space.

213
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,418
I wrote letters to my family

214
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,379
that as soon as I get to orbit

215
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,341
Evelyn's gonna give them to my family.

216
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,884
They don't know that yet, though.

217
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,263
And I also wrote letters
if things didn't go well.

218
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,100
I started with the easy
"yay, I made it to space" letters.

219
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:35,064
But then, other astronauts gave us the
advice to write letters to your family

220
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,693
because what we're doing,
it doesn't come with a zero risk.

221
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:46,200
I feel like people ask us,
"Do you understand the risk?"

222
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:47,910
Of course we do.

223
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:56,710
In the letters that if things
don't go well, I told my family...

224
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,091
to not blame themselves
because I would've done this anyway.

225
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,010
And have no regret

226
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,513
because I have no regrets.

227
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:13,018
And... and then I just told them
how much they mean to me.

228
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,731
And to keep-- you know, keep me around.

229
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,406
I've been through a lot
in the last 20 years.

230
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,742
You know,
from when I was going through treatment,

231
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,785
I...

232
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,249
I never would've imagined that
something like this would come about.

233
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,920
I just wanted to get through
the next couple years.

234
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,215
I just wanted to be able to go
to high school and learn how to drive

235
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,843
and go to prom and go to college.

236
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,348
I had this really special moment
tonight with Leif,

237
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:56,228
and he said, "Look up. Tomorrow
you're gonna be looking down."

238
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,811
[Jared] All right, game plan.
Chair fly run-through.

239
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,732
This is the last time you're gonna get
an opportunity to imagine yourself

240
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,736
going through these motions before you're
actually gonna do them. All right, ready?

241
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,245
Dragon, SpaceX. Ready for comm checks.

242
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,247
Rook, loud and clear.

243
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,374
Leo, loud and clear.

244
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,292
-Nova, loud and clear.
-Hanks, loud and clear.

245
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,844
Retrieve location 8 bags.
114, 115, 116, 117, and distribute.

246
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,471
Cognition test, go.

247
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,389
-One.
-Two.

248
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,390
-Three.
-Four.

249
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,815
Crew check for suit leak checks, go.

250
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,941
-One.
-Two.

251
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,067
-Three.
-Four.

252
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,738
Final crew check for launch, go.

253
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,781
-One.
-Two.

254
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,782
-Three.
-Four.

255
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,035
SpaceX. Dragon.
Inspiration4 is go for launch.

256
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,384
-[Chris] Just black.
-[Hayley] Yeah, I'm excited for that.

257
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,180
[Jared] One hour.

258
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,058
One hour to walkout!

259
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,521
Daddy, look at this one.

260
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,939
[Jared] Thank you.

261
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,150
Give me a hug.

262
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,027
Group hug!

263
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,154
[Jared] I know how lucky I am.

264
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,450
We're all going into this
eyes wide open, right?

265
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,369
As Elon said, the risk is not zero.

266
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:06,126
I couldn't help but think about that
when I was saying goodbye to my kids.

267
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,132
Have a good... Enjoy the show.

268
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,467
-Be safe.
-He thinks I'm lying.

269
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,885
Absolutely.

270
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,553
You, get over here.

271
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,596
That's great.

272
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,014
-I love you.
-I love you too.

273
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,100
- Have a good time.
-I will.

274
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,184
I'll be...

275
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,229
-Love you.
-Yep. See you out there.

276
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,523
-Good.
-Thank you.

277
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,609
-Love you.
-You are brave.

278
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,402
Really.

279
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,708
-Okay, guys. We can start walking.
-Cool.

280
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:51,255
[reporter] <i>And right now we are currently</i>

455
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,061
But to me, it was everything.

456
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:59,732
It was the mission. Like,
we started this, let's see it through.

457
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,653
Hey, everyone. We're doing some research.

458
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:08,992
Taking swabs to see
how microgravity affects the microbiome.

459
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,953
[Chris] I won't tell you
where this one was.

460
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,371
[laughs]

461
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,258
-[Hayley] Hey, Hanks.
-Hey, just ringing the dinner bell here.

462
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,176
-Ringing the dinner bell.
-Yeah.

463
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,564
They gave us an hour for meals

464
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,066
because they know how much
we're gonna be playing with the food.

465
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,403
Oh. Oh.
And they're flying everywhere.

466
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,117
Oh, shit!

467
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,243
Oh, no.

468
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,162
Oh, shit.

469
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,290
Don't tell SpaceX.

470
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,460
[man] <i>Dragon,</i>
<i>Space X for end of day briefing.</i>

471
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:06,799
<i>Currently the distance that you guys</i>
<i>have traveled today is 218,016 km</i>

472
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,803
<i>or just approximately under five and a</i>
<i>half circumnavigations of the globe.</i>

473
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,014
<i>So excellent work by you all.</i>

474
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:19,896
<i>You are go for 4.050</i>
<i>for those crew sleep preparations.</i>

475
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,413
[woman] Get that to connect.

476
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,458
-Oh, let's turn the TV on.
-Oh, that's... here.

477
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,711
-So quiet.
-Yeah.

478
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,923
[Colleen] Whenever we'd get results
of Haley's scans or anything

479
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,219
the doctor knew the first thing she needed
to say was the results,

480
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,639
like, "Clear scans", and so we'd look for
that, and then we would listen

481
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:58,976
to anything she had to say, so if you can
start off with, "Everything's great."

482
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,355
Everything's great.
Your family members are so happy.

483
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,482
-[all cheer]
-[laughs]

484
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,735
Everything's great.
Your family members are so happy.

485
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,991
They've been floating in space,
enjoying life, healthy and happy,

486
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,534
and in really good spirits.

487
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,703
My name is Anna Menon,
and I'm the technical advisor

488
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,871
for the families here for Inspiration4.

489
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,833
And so my job here is to basically
translate what's happening in the mission

490
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,128
for the families, answer any technical
questions they have...

491
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:29,590
At the time they went to bed they had
completed five and a half orbits already.

492
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,803
So now they're getting that constant,
amazing view of that spherical Earth.

493
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,305
-That I'll show you in a minute.
-[man] Oh, yeah.

494
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,183
Just taking you back over
what has transpired in your life

495
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,395
over the past 12 or so hours.

496
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,898
There are tremendous emotions
when going through this.

497
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,608
-Hey...
-Oh, my God!

498
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,404
We are trying to make sure that every
person is cared for.

499
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,657
Oh, Hayley was trying to eat.

500
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,118
Is that like cheese?

501
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,913
-She's looking outside.
-Looking out the window...

502
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,708
We do have access to some
of the internal video,

503
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,501
and we got to watch a little last night.

504
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,880
We'll make sure you guys
get the access to that as we can.

505
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,007
Right now when they're sleeping,
we don't get that as much.

506
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,260
But it is only for you.
You know, we're really...

507
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,013
We're not showing this publicly
as a matter of crew privacy.

508
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,765
Especially if they're not feeling great.

509
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,684
But I think it's important that you get
to see your loved ones floating around.

510
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,644
So the cupola has not been opened yet.

511
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,438
So they elected to not open it last night.

512
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,691
So we would highly expect that they
open it when they wake up.

513
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,737
[man] <i>Dragon, SpaceX. Good morning.</i>

514
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,572
<i>Comm check.</i>

515
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,909
[Jared] <i>Dragon, we have you loud</i>
<i>and clear.</i>

516
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,828
Good morning, everybody.

517
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,954
-Hi.
-Hi.

518
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:42,872
Hello.

519
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,041
Just hanging around.

520
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,417
Nothing new here.

521
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,212
How's your coffee, Hanks?

522
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,339
It's the best.

523
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,841
It's making my day get started so well.

524
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:02,016
Dragon, SpaceX. We're a go
to open the forward hatch

525
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,353
for cupola use, per 4.030.

526
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,772
And please enjoy
the best view of the planet.

527
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:12,360
And copy that, SpaceX.
We are in procedure 4.030.

528
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,279
And we have a go
for opening the forward hatch.

529
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,449
All right, guys, we are going
to open forward hatch.

530
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,284
All right, opening the hatch.

531
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,789
The cupola is a giant glass dome

532
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,291
that is mounted on the top
of the spacecraft.

533
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,252
It's concealed under the nose cone.

534
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,214
And it's just amazing ingenuity.

535
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,383
Checking the indicator. It says it's open.

536
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,968
Like, why don't we
just put the biggest window

537
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,553
that's ever been designed in space in it

538
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,888
because the views are probably
going to be pretty incredible.

539
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,975
Oh, wow.

540
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:49,147
[Hayley] The moment I saw the Earth
from the cupola,

541
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,401
it was indescribable.

542
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,885
[Sian] It is the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen in my life.

543
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:22,388
You know, I wasn't expecting
to get up there

544
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:26,809
and then see
the entire sphere of the Earth.

545
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,939
It's so big, it takes up
the entire cupola's view.

546
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,235
And then you can see just the blackness
of space around you.

547
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,529
And it's just mesmerizing.

548
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,785
[Jared] There's very few that
have seen the Earth from the altitude

549
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,245
that we've been at before.

550
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,706
I mean, it's much higher
than the space station.

551
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:53,878
So, we can see, like, it felt
like the entirety of it.

552
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,181
You can see someone's head.

553
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,726
They're waving now.

554
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,939
[applause]

555
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,198
[Chris] It was so impactful,
I couldn't believe it.

556
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,158
It was overwhelming.

557
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,037
[Hayley] Here is our view.

558
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:34,293
From the cupola you can see the entire
perimeter of the planet.

559
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,632
There's our nose cone.

560
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:44,303
And we're back where we started.
You can see it all from here.

561
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,839
Get that hair down here.

562
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,174
[Hayley] I wanted to have the zero G hair.

563
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,801
Like, I didn't want to hide it.

564
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,636
I wanted it to be as big as possible.

565
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,555
Just showing off my space hair.

566
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,559
I've kept my hair pretty long
ever since I had cancer.

567
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,186
And it felt like such a celebration.

568
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,188
I wish it was like this all the time.

569
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:44,113
While I was in the cupola,
I had my hair all big and crazy,

570
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:48,868
and I took a picture of me holding
a bald photo from when I was in treatment.

571
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:52,621
It felt very indicative
of this almost 20-year journey.

572
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,499
Full circle.

573
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,548
Through the years,
since I was ten years old,

574
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,383
I've lost friends to cancer.

575
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,846
And I wanted to make sure
they were never forgotten.

576
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,475
And so I reached out to
all their families before launch,

577
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:16,520
and said,
"I want to take a picture to space."

578
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,451
It just brought back such good memories
of those friendships

579
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,829
and just feeling like
I had those friends with me.

580
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:42,171
I feel so fortunate to be able
to represent all the kids with cancer.

581
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,508
<i>Arthur, from your perspective,</i>
<i>how are we looking on the floater cam?</i>

582
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,344
Inverted.

583
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,762
You're looking pretty good.

584
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:55,393
Dragon, you are now live
with St. Jude Children's Hospital.

585
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,020
Hello, Miss Hayley.

586
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,397
[Hayley] <i>Hi, guys!</i>

587
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,690
[boy] <i>Dad, come here.</i>

588
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,442
<i>Look at Hayley's hair.</i>

589
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,529
I actually had my patients on the call

590
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,073
who I've gotten to treat
and gotten to know really well.

591
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:14,578
<i>Hello, everyone, and welcome</i>
<i>to our Dragon capsule here in space.</i>

592
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,997
<i>Some of y'all on the call</i>
<i>may know me as your PA.</i>

593
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,917
<i>I work at St. Jude.</i>
<i>I have the best job ever.</i>

594
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,378
<i>And I was a St. Jude patient as a kid.</i>

595
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,423
<i>I was treated for bone cancer.</i>
<i>I spent a year at St. Jude.</i>

596
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:29,510
<i>I had some chemo and surgery, which</i>
<i>might sound familiar to some of y'all.</i>

597
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:33,055
Getting to hear their voices from space
was just the best feeling.

598
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,641
<i>So I'm not gonna delay it any longer.</i>

599
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,769
<i>We're gonna get right to some questions</i>
<i>from our patients.</i>

600
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,021
<i>So, Eva, take it away.</i>

601
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,984
Go ahead, Eva.

602
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,779
What kind of sleeping bag do you have?

603
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,825
<i>Hey, Miss Eva!</i>
<i>Thank you for that question.</i>

604
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,702
<i>So if you've ever been camping,</i>

605
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,329
<i>we pretty much have</i>
<i>those same kind of sleeping bags.</i>

606
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,540
<i>And we had a seatbelt</i>
<i>around our sleeping bags</i>

607
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,500
<i>so we didn't fly away</i>
<i>when we were sleeping.</i>

608
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,335
<i>Hello, Inspiration4.</i>

609
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,922
What were you feeling
right before you launched?

610
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,841
<i>That's a really good question.</i>

611
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,677
<i>So, when we first got strapped</i>
<i>into the rocket,</i>

612
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,721
<i>it felt like time was moving</i>
<i>really slowly.</i>

613
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,849
<i>And then when you got down to</i>
<i>the last five minutes, it was racing.</i>

614
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,809
<i>And before you knew it,</i>
<i>you heard, "Liftoff!"</i>

615
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,062
<i>Hi, I'm Luna</i>

616
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:26,484
<i>and my first question is</i>

617
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,528
<i>what do you do for fun in space?</i>

618
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:36,619
<i>We're doing a lot of fun things, like now.</i>

619
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:41,916
<i>And we're eating, doing chores,</i>

620
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,502
<i>and looking out the window at the world.</i>

621
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:49,673
All the kids asked such sweet questions,
and they were so engaged.

622
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,634
<i>Speak up real loud so she can hear you.</i>

623
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,596
<i>Are there cows on the "mooooon"?</i>

624
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,765
"Are there cows on the moon?"

625
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:02,978
<i>Is there such a thing as aliens in space?</i>

626
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:07,691
<i>I did not think there were until we opened</i>
<i>up our big, beautiful cupola window.</i>

627
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,945
<i>And next thing you know,</i>
<i>who comes flying by?</i>

628
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,199
<i>But don't worry.</i>
<i>He's a friendly alien, as we discovered.</i>

629
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,117
<i>He just likes to take our dog for walks.</i>

630
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,454
<i>That's so cool.</i>

631
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,373
I was thinking about the kids on the call

632
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:27,294
but also all the kids that weren't asking
question but were there and watching.

633
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:32,091
I just really wanted to emphasize to them
that they can do this too.

634
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:36,220
<i>So what we're looking at is</i>
<i>the Earth from our perspective.</i>

635
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,305
<i>So we are flying this huge window,</i>

636
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,724
<i>the biggest window</i>
<i>that's ever been flown in space,</i>

637
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:45,604
<i>and looking through the window, we can see</i>
<i>the entire perimeter of the Earth.</i>

638
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,731
<i>Which is so beautiful.</i>

639
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,900
<i>And I hope that you're getting to see</i>
<i>what we see,</i>

640
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,195
<i>which is passing over</i>
<i>some really beautiful water,</i>

641
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,072
<i>beautiful land and lots of clouds.</i>

642
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,950
So cool.

643
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,286
[Colleen] Hayley, she told me repeatedly

644
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:05,165
that she was looking forward to
the phone call with the St. Jude patients.

645
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:09,295
At one point, it looked like
that might be kind of hard to accomplish.

646
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,798
And she insisted that that take place.

647
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,842
[Hayley] <i>Because floating is awesome.</i>

648
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,682
[Colleen] I have admired her
her whole life.

649
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:27,021
All the way fast-forward to how
she has really dedicated herself

650
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,732
to this mission for the kids of St. Jude.

651
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,484
<i>And I just want you all to know</i>
<i>that we're doing this for you.</i>

652
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,529
<i>And if I can do this, you can do this,</i>

653
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,489
<i>and I'm so proud</i>
<i>of each and every one of you.</i>

654
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:03,390
[Kidd] So for the launch, we sat on
mission control at Kennedy Space Center.

655
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,352
As soon as they were on orbit,
we jumped in the jet,

656
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,396
flew out here to Hawthorne
to SpaceX's mission control,

657
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,607
went straight to console

658
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,652
to fulfill our roles and responsibilities
supporting this team.

659
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:19,323
To make sure we execute
a safe return here in a couple days.

660
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:25,621
[Leif] Good news was, last time I checked,
everything was still trending

661
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:28,123
right around that five, six knot regime.

662
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:34,713
Which is amazing, because to have seven
locations in Florida in September align

663
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:39,259
is just another testament to
the stars aligning in our house of cards.

664
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:43,681
There's seven potential landing sites
from the Gulf side of Florida

665
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,933
to the Atlantic side of Florida.

666
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:50,354
What is going to govern reentry
is gonna be the weather we're predicting

667
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,898
at one of
the seven potential landing sites.

668
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,402
Twenty-four hours prior to splashdown,
we pick a location,

669
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,655
and then you start
what we call "phasing the orbit."

670
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:03,117
You actually orbit the Earth a little bit
quicker or a little bit slower

671
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,743
based on the altitude you are.

672
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:09,164
And so you can kind of pick an altitude,
so that on that final orbit,

673
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,793
the part of the Earth that has that
landing site in it is gonna be aligned.

674
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,546
[Leif] You know what would be really cool?

675
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,966
Because they have not done this yet,

676
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,718
would be to land right off
of the cape. Cape North.

677
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,804
It'd be another nice first
for the mission.

678
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,100
Pretty ballsy to park in Elon's spot.

679
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,059
Is this Elon's?

680
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:32,062
-Perfect! He's not gonna be here.
-[laughs]

681
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,611
[man] <i>What we're looking at is basically</i>

682
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:43,282
<i>a mix of three different things that</i>
<i>are kind of impacting</i>

683
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,992
<i>the splashdown time.</i>

684
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,162
<i>You basically have the remnants from</i>
<i>Tropical Storm Nicholas</i>

685
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,038
<i>over the Gulf areas.</i>

686
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,711
<i>So you can see a lot of lightning in the</i>
<i>Southern Gulf or Central Gulf at that time</i>

687
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,504
<i>just south of most of the sites</i>

688
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,091
<i>You know, this to me looks like</i>
<i>it's a pretty good setup</i>

689
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,219
<i>for the Atlantic sites</i>
<i>if all the winds are low.</i>

690
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,639
In summary, we're recommending
the Cape North site.

691
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,976
I believe this team has come to that
consensus. That is the decision.

692
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,438
We've chosen Cape North
for the landing site,

693
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,941
which is off of Cape Canaveral,
where they launched from.

694
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,403
It'll be the first time SpaceX has landed
Dragon in the Atlantic Ocean.

695
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,199
All the previous ones have been
in the Gulf of Mexico.

696
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:29,286
So, everybody there in Florida will
potentially have the opportunity

697
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,246
to see Dragon fly by

698
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,833
before she deploys her parachutes
and comes on down safely.

699
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:49,806
-Hey, fam.
-Hey.

700
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,683
So, it looks like
we might have a video pass,

701
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,560
so what we're gonna do is try
to pull up some video.

702
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,395
-[Colleen] Oh, my God.
-I can't promise anything,

703
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,939
-but we're gonna try to pull it up.
-Absolutely.

704
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,149
Hi, this is Erin.

705
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,610
[man] <i>Hi, Erin, good evening.</i>
<i>This is mission control.</i>

706
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:04,196
<i>-How are you doing?</i>
-I'm doing well. How are you?

707
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:07,491
<i>Very well. And we are ready</i>
<i>to connect you with Chris now.</i>

708
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:11,662
<i>I will hand you over to Sarah</i>
<i>who will then connect you to Sian.</i>

709
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,332
<i>Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check with Monica.</i>

710
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,752
-Hi!
<i>-</i>[Hayley] <i>Hey, guys. How's it going?</i>

711
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,671
-Oh, my God, Hayley!
-Hey, good! How are you?

712
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:24,758
-How are you?
<i>-I'm awesome. Having the time of my life.</i>

713
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:28,387
Hi, honey. It's nice to see your face.

714
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,140
<i>Well, hi there. I can't see yours,</i>
<i>but that's cool.</i>

715
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,809
<i>Glad you still like my face.</i>

716
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:37,062
[Hayley] <i>Y'all, Earth looks</i>
<i>so incredible from space.</i>

717
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,940
<i>From the cupola window,</i>
<i>you can see the entire perimeter of Earth.</i>

718
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,985
-Oh, wow.
-<i>And it's incredible.</i>

719
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,489
[Sian] <i>We have the cupola open right now.</i>
<i>I mean, the view is spectacular.</i>

720
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,409
<i>You can see the stars all out.</i>
<i>It's fantastic.</i>

721
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:56,331
Daddy, have you seen the Milky Way
or a black hole?

722
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,667
Did you see any stars?

723
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,587
<i>We had a few Milky Ways up here,</i>
<i>but then we ate them all.</i>

724
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,214
[all laugh]

725
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,467
-Here you go, Hanks...
-Okay, let's do it.

726
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:11,597
[Hayley] You're so good at this.
You've never missed.

727
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,058
Hayley, how were you feeling before launch

728
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,060
when y'all were just sitting there
for all that time?

729
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,230
<i>I was so calm.</i>
<i>I thought I was going to be like terrified</i>

730
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,149
<i>but I was just like, let's do this.</i>

731
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:27,195
I gotta say, Hayley, I'm really digging
the zero G hair you've got going on.

732
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,406
<i>Yeah, I don't know if</i>
<i>my crew members are as much</i>

733
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:33,201
<i>because there's been little pieces</i>
<i>of Hayley hair.</i>

734
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,245
[all laugh]

735
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,582
Just give me some of that hair
so I can have it.

736
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,208
-It looks good on you.
-Yeah.

737
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,377
Yeah. There you go.

738
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,297
-But your hair's the best.
-Look at us.

739
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,675
I love seeing your smiling face.
I miss you.

740
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,345
I'm super excited to see you tomorrow.

741
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,640
Love you, babe.
I hope you're having a good time.

742
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,475
Here, say, "Love you, Daddy."

743
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,559
-Love you, Daddy.
-Love you, Daddy.

744
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,311
<i>Love you, little people.</i>

745
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:03,440
-All right, it was great talking to you.
-This has been wonderful.

746
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,399
Love you.

747
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,859
-Yeah, we love you, Hayley.
-We love you.

748
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,277
<i>Love you too.</i>

749
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,278
-Bye.
-Bye.

750
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,031
[Sian] <i>It was the best ride ever.</i>

751
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,492
<i>It was smoother</i>
<i>than I thought it was going to be.</i>

752
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,910
<i>It just was so much fun.</i>

753
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:20,624
To have the Neil Armstrong autograph
and the medal,

754
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,335
knowing how proud they would be,

755
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,296
especially my dad, about this moment,

756
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,467
you know, there is nothing
I would wish more

757
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,261
than my parents
to have been able to see that.

758
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,432
Hey, family, it's me

759
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,975
in the cupola.

760
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,895
Just traveling around the Earth,
getting ready to come home tomorrow.

761
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,397
It's a big, beautiful Earth

762
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,317
Oh, just having some morning coffee.

763
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,443
Show us.

764
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,114
Here it is. So, this started off,
like our first day in orbit,

765
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,865
pretty much frozen solid,

766
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,909
and it was like a coffee slushie.

767
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:57,953
And now it's nice and lukewarm,

768
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,038
so it's getting a little bit
closer to home,

769
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,915
and we're getting closer
to home today.

770
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,919
So, this is our last time in the cupola,

771
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:10,048
Yup, and I don't want to cry
because the Earth is so beautiful.

772
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,466
Oh, I'm already there.

773
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,928
It's been a real pleasure
to go to space with you.

774
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:17,764
-You too.
-Yeah.

775
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,309
Just, like, getting to see something
that so few people get to see,

776
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,520
-we're so lucky.
-You can't make me cry.

777
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,442
Oh, my God. It is stunning.

778
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,363
[Hayley] It's just so beautiful.

779
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,376
[woman] Good morning.

780
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,128
-[Anna] How are you?
-[woman] Good morning.

781
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,296
[Anna] Welcome back.

782
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,090
Your family is doing really,
really, really well,

783
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,259
and we're gonna bring them home today.

784
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:57,554
-[Colleen] Yay!
-[cheers, applause]

785
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:13,528
[Anna] The crew have gone approximately
38 circumnavigations

786
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,363
of the globe as of the time
they went to bed,

787
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,407
which was around 5:30 a.m. our time.

788
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,410
They did a lot yesterday.

789
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:25,165
Today will be basically wake up
and get really into focused ops to return.

790
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,959
We will experience a short period
of comm blackout.

791
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,670
It could be around seven minutes.
This is really normal.

792
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:35,467
This happens due to the heating
experienced by the spacecraft

793
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,384
during reentry.

794
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,556
[Chris] During reentry,
there is risk involved.

795
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,558
You have a lot of energy, right?

796
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,520
So you lose
some thermal protection on reentry.

797
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,357
When you're ready to reenter,

798
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,360
you start firing your rockets
to slow down.

799
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,654
Your altitude starts decaying.

800
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:59,199
Now the drag of the atmosphere
starts slowing the vehicle down.

801
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,326
They're gonna be seeing
out the side windows

802
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,538
some flame or some heat
as it's coming down.

803
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:09,960
At that point, you lose voice transmission
for about seven minutes.

804
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:14,589
It's possible to lose a vehicle that way,
kind of like we lost Columbia.

805
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:19,135
You can't put a giant bubble
around everything and call it safe.

806
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:22,973
You know, you have to step out
and say, "Hey, there is this risk here."

807
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,518
"I'm willing to accept it
for the goal I'm about to achieve."

808
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,981
Hayley said she's looking forward
to my hug when she comes back,

809
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,149
but she said, "But don't crush me, Mom."

810
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,818
"Like, don't crush me."

811
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,611
[all laugh]

812
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,698
I made no promise.

813
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:54,963
They're up there.

814
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,468
I remember Ed Viesturs
who climbed with you guys saying,

815
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,430
"You haven't climbed the mountain
until you get back down."

816
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,016
I think we're at that part

817
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:09,853
where soon they'll be able to say
that they've climbed the mountain,

818
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,690
and we're all gonna be able
to take a deep breath and celebrate.

819
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,317
I can't wait.

820
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,694
-Are we actually certified for this?
-I'm giddy.

821
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,112
This is...

822
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,031
surreal.

823
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,244
[Arthur] All right, Jared.

824
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,371
Everything's looking really good
for your return to Earth.

825
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,373
Continuing on to vehicle status,

826
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,335
we are healthy
and looking good for de-orbit entry.

827
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:37,088
Landing will be approximately
7:06 p.m. Eastern time,

828
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,340
right before sunset.

829
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,717
Regarding the recovery team,

830
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,886
they are in position and ready to support,

831
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,429
currently launching fast boats.

832
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,893
[Jared] And we copy all. We're gonna have
a good sunset over flight of Florida.

833
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,770
We're looking forward
to seeing all you guys soon.

834
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,356
I always think about, like,
what is the worst thing

835
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,066
that could happen in every phase,

836
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,901
and what I am gonna do about it,

837
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,194
and what can I do about it.

838
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,197
The big one kind of on the way downhill

839
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,991
is going to be that we have a much,
much higher risk

840
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,243
of micrometeorite orbital debris hits

841
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,704
at the altitude we flew
at than the space station.

842
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,206
It would be the highest risk
of the mission

843
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,084
So it's like you won't know
if you took a hit

844
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,004
until you're entering
the Earth's atmosphere,

845
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,549
and that's where you could have
a situation like we saw in the past.

846
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,470
That's one of those where there's nothing
we can do about this right now.

847
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,639
You just got to hope.

848
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:34,646
[Arthur] <i>Dragon, SpaceX is go</i>
<i>for de-orbit, entry, and landing.</i>

849
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:38,274
[Jared] <i>And copy that, SpaceX.</i>
<i>Go for de-orbit, entry, and landing.</i>

850
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,734
[Arthur] <i>And, Jared, great read-back.</i>

851
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,528
<i>We're looking forward</i>
<i>to bringing you home.</i>

852
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,616
[Anna] 7:43. So that...

853
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,078
That whole process
is gonna take about 45 minutes.

854
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,414
The waters are looking crystal clear,

855
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,541
glassy flat. Looking really good.

856
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,127
Crew have already all passed
their suit-leak checks.

857
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,380
And they're getting ready
to start this whole sequence very soon.

858
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,135
[Monica] Splashdown's scary.
I know everyone's excited,

859
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,720
and I think we all are.

860
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:10,807
But there's still the possibility
that something could still go wrong,

861
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,642
and that's scary too.

862
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,772
[Colleen] In the back of my mind,
I mean, I'm not going there,

863
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:21,026
but I know what the risks were.

864
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:25,196
There's splashdown, and there's
getting the capsule onto the boat,

865
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,949
and then getting in a helicopter.

866
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,661
And, so, it will be a great relief

867
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,955
that she's back.

868
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,543
[Andy] Good afternoon, and welcome
to SpaceX's splashdown coverage

869
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:42,172
of the world's first all-civilian
astronaut mission to orbit.

870
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,888
At 3:17 p.m. Pacific time,

871
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,474
we'll have the beginning
of the de-orbit burn.

872
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:56,311
And that is what will line up Dragon
for reentry into Earth's atmosphere.

873
00:55:56,978 --> 00:56:00,774
[reporter] During reentry, we will have
an expected loss of communications

874
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,525
with Dragon for about seven minutes

875
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,570
as Dragon passes back
into the Earth's atmosphere.

876
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,490
[Andy] A few minutes
after we get communications back,

877
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:12,077
we're gonna start to deploy our parachutes
to bring vehicle velocity down

878
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,955
to just fifteen miles an hour,
at which point we have splashdown.

879
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:20,627
[Arthur] <i>Dragon, de-orbit sequence start</i>
<i>in five minutes. You are now live.</i>

880
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,172
[Jared] <i>And copy that, SpaceX.</i>
<i>We show the same.</i>

881
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,259
<i>Go, SpaceX.</i>

882
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,512
[Arthur] Jared, you're looking good.

883
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,890
No deltas to timeline.
Vehicle's nominal. Tracking no issues.

884
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,934
The de-orbit burn
is right down the middle,

885
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,894
with nominal
landing site targeting.

886
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,938
No deltas on weather or recovery.

887
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,648
And we're looking forward
to having you home shortly.

888
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,160
[Andy] So, at this point, we are entering
a communications blackout period,

889
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,870
which lasts approximately seven minutes,

890
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,373
due to plasma formation
around the spacecraft.

891
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:15,348
[woman] <i>We're currently in progress</i>
<i>of the blackout period.</i>

892
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,976
<i>The Dragon spacecraft,</i>

893
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:21,396
<i>it'll see external temperatures</i>
<i>of about 3,500 degrees,</i>

894
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,357
<i>preventing communication</i>
<i>with the Dragon spacecraft.</i>

895
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:36,870
So, we should, in a couple minutes here,
start hearing some comms from the CORE

896
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:40,582
checking in to regain
that communication with Dragon.

897
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,339
[Arthur] <i>Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.</i>

898
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,181
[Arthur] <i>Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.</i>

899
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,144
[Jared] <i>Dragon hears you loud and clear.</i>
<i>How me?</i>

[cheers, applause]

901
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,954
[woman] <i>What you are seeing</i>
<i>is a view from our thermal camera</i>

902
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,541
<i>seeing Dragon coming back</i>
<i>down to Earth right there.</i>

903
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,801
-Was that the...?
-That was the sonic boom right there.

904
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,224
[Arthur] <i>Dragon, loud and clear.</i>

905
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,684
<i>We have your visual on the aircraft.</i>
<i>You're looking great.</i>

906
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,399
<i>Dragon, expect automated chute deployment.</i>

907
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,361
[Jared] <i>Copy that, SpaceX. We're bracing.</i>

908
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,365
[cheering]

909
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,952
[Arthur] <i>Dragon, visual on two</i>
<i>good drogues.</i>

910
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,121
[cheers, applause]

911
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,960
[Andy] We are expecting
for these to cut off

912
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,712
and the main chutes
to come shortly after this.

913
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:15,218
[woman] And we do have confirmation
that the main chutes have deployed.

914
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,517
[Arthur] <i>Dragon, descend rate nominal.</i>

915
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,394
<i>You have visual from recovery forces.</i>

916
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,813
[Jared] <i>Copy that, SpaceX. Good news.</i>

917
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,860
<i>One thousand.</i>

918
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,112
[Arthur] <i>Copy 1,000.</i>

919
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,371
[Jared] <i>Six hundred.</i>

00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,415
[Arthur] <i>Copy 600.</i>

921

[Jared] <i>Two hundred. We're bracing.</i>

[Arthur] <i>Copy 200.</i>

923
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,787
<i>Dragon, SpaceX sees splashdown</i>
<i>and mains release!</i>

924
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,372
[Jared] <i>SpaceX, we have splashdown.</i>

925
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,462
[cheers, applause]

926
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,806
You're okay.

927
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,310
-You're okay.
-[Monica] I never want to do this again.

928
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:57,487
[Jared] <i>And Inspiration4</i>
<i>is mission complete.</i>

929
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,825
[cheers, applause]

930
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,308
[man] Inspiration4, on behalf of SpaceX,
welcome home to planet Earth.

931
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:32,438
Thank you for sharing your leadership,
hope, generosity, and prosperity,

932
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,857
and congratulations
on your incredible journey.

933
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:48,079
<i>Dragon, stand by</i>
<i>for side hatch opening and egress.</i>

934
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:51,416
<i>This will be our last call from you.</i>
<i>Congratulations, Inspiration4 crew.</i>

935
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,834
<i>Signing off.</i>

936
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,635
[Jared] Copy that...

937
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,345
[cheers]

938
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,389
[Hayley] I know!

939
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,267
[man] Hey!

940
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,395
-Welcome home, earthlings.
-Hey, man.

941
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,313
We're glad to have you back.

942
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,232
-[Jared] Good to see you.
-Glad to have you back.

943
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,537
-Hey, guys.
-What's up?

944
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,038
Rock stars.

945
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,048
[man] You still feel like
a zero-G monster?

946
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,884
Zero-G monster?

947
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:43,926
Yes!

948
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,344
All right.

949
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,013
Just wait one sec.

950
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,308
[applause, laughter]

951
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:01,944
[Sian] We went to space for three days

952
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,571
and successfully came back.

953
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,366
[applause, laughter]

954
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,788
We're bonded for life.

955
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:15,249
Hayley's my sister,
and Jared and Chris are my brothers.

956
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,542
We're a family.

957
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:21,464
[Chris] It made me realize that
there's so much to see

958
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:24,634
here on the Earth, that I really
want to go out and explore it.

959
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,679
Seeing it from above just gives you
kind of that introduction

960
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:32,892
to the beginning
of what life probably should be.

961
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,852
And that's where I am right now.

962
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,647
It's like it's just the beginning
of a longer book.

963
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,443
Hey, guys. Thanks for everything.

964
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,279
Inspiration4 just set the bar very high.

965
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,324
I mean, the best moment for me
was when we got back down to Earth,

966
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:52,286
and we knew we exceeded
the $200 million goal for St. Jude.

967
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,582
We completed all of our
on-orbit objectives.

968
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,793
It felt like a good mission complete.

969
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:02,421
And it also felt like it's game on.

970
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:07,760
There's gonna be starships
going around Mars in our lifetime.

971
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,888
There's gonna be starships
landing on Mars in our lifetime.

972
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:13,808
Humanity is just getting started.

973
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,569
[cheering]

974
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:30,074
I feel so fortunate every day
just to be alive.

975
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,159
And whenever I get to do big things,

976
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,078
and this is the biggest thing
I've ever done,

977
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,788
I just feel especially fortunate.

978
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,167
It's been a great adventure,

979
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,337
and I'm gonna miss these guys.

980
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,343
