All this social media bollocks,

it's the devil, I'm telling you.
It's evil. Yep. Toxic.

SIRENS WAIL IN DISTANCE
Little worms, burrowing in our ears

19
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:11,003
every minute of every day,
influencing. Don't want to be

20
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:14,122
influenced. You know how I feel
about influencers. We've got history

21
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:17,522
with that. Yep. We're more
distant now than ever. Somehow,

22
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:21,202
people are seduced into thinking
we're, I don't know, intimate.

23
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:23,002
People can't talk to
each other any more.

24
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:26,441
We're remote, glued to devices,
phones, computers,

25
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:29,721
victims of the tech bros
promising an easier life,

26
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:32,321
while picking our pockets
and stealing our souls.

27
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:35,361
I'm serious! I think
they're taking our souls.

28
00:02:35,362 --> 00:02:37,961
We'll wake up one day
in a world without soul.

29
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,280
No souls left.

30
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:41,240
I don't want the tech bros
taking my soul.

31
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:44,840
I get that.
"I get that"? That's it?

32
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm spilling out my heart here,
and all you can say is,

33
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,200
"I get that"?
It's 6am, and I'm tired.

34
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,519
I need sleep.
Everybody needs sleep.

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,359
And we'll still have Marvin Gaye.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,799
What? Soul.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,839
Funny!

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,279
I wouldn't exactly say you were
spilling out your heart.

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,639
I was! Please tell me that's not
the contents of your heart.

40
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,878
All right, maybe not,
but it worries me. Yep.

41
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,638
I get that.

Thanks. Thank you.

43
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,998
Don't know how long he's been there.
Too long, that's for sure.

44
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,757
Not going to be pretty!

45
00:03:17,758 --> 00:03:19,598
Is it ever pretty?

46
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,797
Hey, Nikki. Sarah!

47
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:26,997
And if it isn't my favourite
Northern Irish bloke!

48
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,837
How many do you know?

49
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:30,318
You're it.

50
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:42,076
How are you, Torres? Still pacing
the Earth, in my search for justice.

51
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:44,395
Yeah. Good to see you, Jack.

52
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:48,316
You and me, we're like distant
cousins who only meet at funerals.

53
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,915
Takes a dead person to get
the family back together.

54
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:52,995
And look at that,

55
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:55,276
we've got one. Yep.

56
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:59,195
But not one with a family
that gave a toss.

57
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:12,953
Do we know who it is? Not yet.

58
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:16,513
We got an anonymous call a few
hours ago - a would-be burglar,

59
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:18,273
who got more than he bargained for.

60
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:19,953
The guy's going to
need counselling.

61
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:21,553
How long do you think?

62
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:24,792
Six months, a year. Maybe longer.

63
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:26,032
Nobody missed them.

64
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,992
Nobody missed them enough.

65
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:29,593
I'll start around the body.

66
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:34,752
Flat seems undisturbed.

67
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:37,272
Nothing to suggest
any kind of struggle.

68
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,071
Broken door?

69
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,432
Yeah. That's where the burglar
made his entrance.

70
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:47,831
Housing association says the flat
is rented to Martin Piler.

71
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:49,831
All the utilities are in his name.

72

JACK WHISTLES

73
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,870
Piler's got post!

74
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,190
Piler dies and no-one notices.

75
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,349
Was he on a social care register?

76
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,109
Was he on benefits? Pension?
All on my list to check.

77
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,868
Housing association doesn't wonder
why rent's not being paid?

78
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,708
Utility companies
didn't cut him off?

79
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,468
They're all busy working from home.

80
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:23,148
None of his neighbours noticed.
He just fell into

81
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:25,469
a...black hole of nothingness.

82
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:29,508
Does anyone care if
Martin Piler even existed?

83
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:54,106
All right? Mm-hm.

84
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:10,024
Nikki?

85
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:11,905
Someone was in pain.

86
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:17,544
15.5 million people say
they're in chronic pain.

87
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,823
34% of the population.

88
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:22,143
Why do you know that?
Doctors deal with pain.

89
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:23,823
That's what they do. Yeah,

90
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:26,904
but your patients aren't really
feeling it any more, are they?

91
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:32,582
No prescription label.

92
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,262
Maybe there's just no label.

93
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:36,903
Pharmacists are obliged
to label every box.

94
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:42,382
Paula Jackson. Who's Paula Jackson?

95
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:45,062
The body looks like
it could be an adult female.

96
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:46,421
Not Martin Piler, then?

97
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:47,702
Apparently not.

98
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:51,261
Eight credit cards?

99
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:52,941
Eight?! Yeah.

100
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,621
Do you not have eight credit cards?

101
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,981
Of course I do.

102
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,900
Along with my six cars
and three houses!

103
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,380
When do we think Paula died?

104
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:01,780
We're never going to be exact

105
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:04,821
based on an in-situ examination
of the body.

106
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:37,057
The use-by date on the milk
is the 15th of May last year.

107
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,297
Nearly a year ago.

108
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:40,017
Possible. Gives us a window.

109
00:07:40,018 --> 00:07:42,138
Old people die in their sleep.

110
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:45,938
I think
I'd like to die in my sleep.

111
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,737
How old do you think she was?
I don't know.

112
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:51,696
I'll use a CT scan.

113
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:54,376
I can try to estimate age
from a 3D reconstruction

114
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:56,657
and anthropological measurements.

115
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:03,016
Going to put a UV light on
in the room.

116
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:14,016
Whoa!

117
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:25,655
Jackson bloody Pollock!

118
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:32,133
Hmm. Insects feed on the body

119
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,293
and spread minute fluid samples

120
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:35,854
all over the room.

121
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:38,293
Insect staining.

122
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:41,093
It's a natural
decomposition process.

123
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:44,092
Never seen it like this before.

124
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:46,413
It's indicative of how
long she's been here.

125
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:56,692
Maybe she didn't die in her sleep.

126
00:09:06,572 --> 00:09:08,570
Are you residents on this estate?

127
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:11,130
Well, we live on the top floor.

128
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:13,251
We heard a noise from
the third floor...

Did you have any contact

135

MAN: I never saw her.
You know how it is.

We're busy, working,

We didn't really know her.

pry into anyone else's business.

TORRES: We're investigating

141
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:17,405
Did anything unusual happen

142
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:18,685
on the estate last year?

143
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,006
Last summer...

144
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:25,805
..there was a...terrible smell
coming from that flat.

145
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:30,524
We told the housing association
about it,

146
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:32,165
but they wouldn't do a thing.

147
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,124
Another tenant mentioned a smell

148
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,404
about a year ago.
Do you have any memory of that?

149
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,643
THIRD MAN: I remember
about May or June,

150
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:42,723
we had flies, hundreds of them.

151
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:43,844
It was disgusting.

152
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:47,083
I was changing my light
in summer last year,

153
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:49,523
and a whole load of maggots
came through the ceiling.

154
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,163
I complained to the council,
but no-one came.

155
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,562
SECOND WOMAN: I can't believe it.

156
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:59,002
There's been a woman in there,

157
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:01,203
dead, all this time!

158
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:06,321
I need to ask you about

159
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:08,561
the person who lived next door.

160
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:10,401
Have you ever heard of
someone called

161
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:12,361
Paula Jackson?

162
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:14,001
How about the name Martin Piler?

163
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,961
Ring any bells? No.

164
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:19,121
When was the last time
you saw your neighbour?

165
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:23,840
Can you tell me what she
looked like? Was she old?

166
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:26,320
I... Was she young? I wouldn't know.

167
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:29,040
I wouldn't know what
she looked like.

168
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,240
They were always different people.

169
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,119
Did you have any contact
with your neighbour?

170
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,999
Did you ever have
a conversation with her?

171
00:11:41,1000 --> 00:11:44,679
FOURTH MAN: Not that I can
remember. I never saw her.

172
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,798
She lived on your floor. You must

173
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,238
have passed on the stairs,

174
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,238
seen her go into her flat.

175
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:53,839
Anything you can tell us
might be important.

176
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:56,758
I'm really sorry.

177
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,997
DEEP SIGH

178
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,156
Thanks.

179
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,356
HE SIGHS

180
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:37,874
Thanks. I'll get the DNA
from the blood on the rug

181
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,154
to compare to the body.
I think we'll struggle to get

182
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:42,434
a decent sample of DNA
from the body. Hmm.

183
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:44,274
If we can get pulp
from a molar tooth,

184
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:46,394
we should be able to get
mitochondrial DNA.

185
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,993
OK. Blood on the rug -

186
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:51,194
why did they bleed out?
Is there an obvious wound?

187
00:12:52,474 --> 00:12:54,433
Nope. No?

188
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:57,513
Mummification can disguise
the injury. Yeah. OK.

189
00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:59,833
We got a name? Paula Jackson.

190
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:02,352
And what do we know about her?
Very little.

191
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:03,633
I'll get started.

192
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,073
There she is!

193
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:16,111
First day, work placement.

194
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:18,152
Are you ready to get started?

195
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:21,711
I've been waiting.

196
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:23,031
Who's this?

197
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:25,831
This is Barbara,

198
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:27,710
my Access to Work interpreter.

199
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:29,710
Hi, Barbara.

200
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:32,191
Great. Shall we get you set up?

201
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:42,350
Right, let's get to it.

202
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,509
Hey, Gabriel. Lovely to see you.
Sarah.

203
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,469
Not lovely in the
traditional sense, but...

204
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,348
Anyway, you know what I mean.

205
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,748
In a nontraditional way.

206
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:56,988
Yeah. Thanks for making that

207
00:13:56,989 --> 00:13:59,269
more awkward than it needed to be!

208
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,148
Can I borrow Nikki to swab some DNA?

209
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:04,828
Whose DNA?

210
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,107
Paula Jackson was registered
as a missing person

211
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:10,348
in June of last year,
by a Leo Jackson.

212
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,547
UPTEMPO MUSIC BLARES

213
00:14:41,186 --> 00:14:42,905
HE LAUGHS
So now, she's busting out

214
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:44,745
the dance moves! You should see

215
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:47,984
my twerking. Mum, you're so sus!

216
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,024
KNOCK ON DOOR
Get that door.

217
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:52,384
And if that's Mrs Bauer
complaining about the noise,

218
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:54,225
tell her to clear up after that cat!

219
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,144
TORRES: Morning.
Morning.

220
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,703
I see you're working hard. Always.

221
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:02,384
Sorry to disturb you.
Detective Inspector Torres.

222
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:06,063
What do you want?

223
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:07,583
I'm looking for Leo Jackson.

224
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:09,543
What for?

225
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:11,024
Why do you want to talk to him?

226
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:14,582
We can use your DNA

227
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,663
to try to formally identify
your sister.

228
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,223
Right.

229
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:21,982
Can't we see her?

230
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:23,183
I wouldn't.

231
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:26,901
She wouldn't look like
the person you remember.

232
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:28,582
Has she been dead a long time?

233
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:33,021
How did she die?

234
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:35,462
We don't know. Drugs.

235
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:39,740
I'll be able to answer
more of your questions

236
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:41,181
after the postmortem.

237
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:44,860
You are Natasha Jackson? Yeah.

238
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,340
Older or younger sister? Older.

239
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:49,140
How old would your sister be now?

240
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:50,580
37.

241
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,500
I'm just going to swab the
inside of your cheek, OK?

242
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,379
One more.

243
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,698
Thank you. All done.

244
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:11,818
Any medical information
that you could give us

245
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:14,138
would really help. She had asthma.

246
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,858
Um, she took some
medication for it,

247
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:17,817
but it never really
seemed to bother her.

248
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:19,257
Didn't stop her from smoking.

249
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:21,617
When was the last time
you heard from Paula?

250
00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:24,417
About a year ago. A long time now.

251
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:27,977
She was always disappearing.
You weren't worried about her?

252
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:30,137
We, um, lost touch.

253
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:34,137
I-I didn't even know
where she was living.

254
00:16:36,937 --> 00:16:40,976
So, there are no NHS dental records

255
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:43,335
to cross-reference. The body is in

256
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,815
an advanced state of decomposition.

257
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:50,976
No obvious external injuries
on the visible surfaces.

258
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:55,174
Breast implants present.

259
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:56,735
They seem intact.

260
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:09,533
I'll take some hair

261
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:11,414
for some long-term toxicology.

262
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:21,933
Some scissors? Thank you.

263
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:43,251
Please can you make sure you label

264
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:45,252
the scalp edge? Mm-hm.

265
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:48,170
All right.

266
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:50,570
Let's see if we can get a tooth.

267
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:51,850
Hmm?

268
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:54,690
Our best chance of getting
a decent DNA sample

269
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:58,530
for the coroner.
Definitive identification.

270
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:00,649
DNA register?

271
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,090
Or family.

272
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,769
Family is something
very different on paper

273
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,369
to what it is in reality.

274
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,009
We can distance ourselves from

275
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,329
our families, but we can't

276
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,929
sever the genetic links.

277
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,607
We didn't recover any
mobiles from the flat.

278
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:29,287
Can you give me her number?
I don't have it.

279
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,407
A photo would be helpful.

280
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:33,288
I don't have one.

281
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:38,447
I've got one.

282
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:40,086
On my phone.

283
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:41,767
Great.

284
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:48,007
We're painting my room,
so I'm studying in here.

285
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:51,126
What are you studying?

286
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:52,765
A-levels.

287
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:56,125
English, history, maths,
and computer science. Four?

288
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,925
Brainbox.
HE CHUCKLES

289
00:18:57,926 --> 00:19:00,165
I'm not sure what I want to do yet.

290
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,965
Options? Yeah.

291
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:04,606
I want to do something...

292
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:08,645
..I don't know, good?

293
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:11,805
"Consequential".

294
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:15,804
That's what my history teacher
says, Mr Grossal.

295
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:19,123
Says I'm capable of something
"consequential".

296
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,404
I'm just not sure what that is yet.

297
00:19:22,564 --> 00:19:26,643
That's her, my aunt. Paula.

298
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:28,243
Can you send it to me?

299
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:29,643
Yeah.

300
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:31,602
Of course.

301
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,882
Your mum said
Paula used to disappear a lot.

302
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:35,882
All the time.

303
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,803
Was that ordinary behaviour
from her?

304
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:43,003
Yeah. So why did you report it
this time? What was different?

305
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:47,002
She'd go missing with Mum, maybe...

306
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,682
..but she always
stayed in touch with me.

307
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:55,602
We were more like mates.

308
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,640
But not this time.

309
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:01,081
No messages.

310
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,521
No nothing.

311
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,761
Deep down...

312
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:10,720
..I knew she was dead.

313
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,320
Why would someone like
you want to be police?

314
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,999
Cos I believe in giving
someone like you a future.

315
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,118
And I have two sons,

316
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,919
and I want them to be
"consequential", too.

317
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,877
Did she take illegal substances?

318
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:38,838
Yeah. Do you know which ones?

319
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,317
She was a crack whore.

320
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:43,837
It's what she was.

321
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:46,437
She probably took all
of them. I don't know.

322
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:48,676
Her boyfriend, Roy,
was a drug dealer.

323
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:53,036
She'd get clean, go back on,
get clean, go back on...

324
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:55,437
She had a dozen second chances.

325
00:20:57,117 --> 00:21:01,476
Couldn't trust her. My own sister,
and I couldn't trust her.

326
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,915
I blame him.

327
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,675
Where is Roy now? I don't know.

328
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:10,115
He went to prison for a while
as a pimp and a drug dealer,

329
00:21:10,116 --> 00:21:11,795
so I don't know
what happened to him.

330
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:13,795
Just...scum of the Earth.

331
00:21:13,796 --> 00:21:16,314
Anything else?

332
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,795
Anything that could help us
identify her?

333
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:21,675
Did she have children?

334
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:25,594
She wasn't capable
of being a mother.

335
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:27,234
LEO: Do we have to
talk about this now?

336
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,674
TORRES: Of course not.
Thank you.

337
00:21:32,954 --> 00:21:34,914
Thank you for speaking with us.

338
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:38,713
In case you think of anything.

339
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,393
And if you need to reach me...

340
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:50,793
Was my aunt murdered?

341
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,952
We haven't established
cause of death yet.

342
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,031
The internal organs

343
00:21:59,032 --> 00:22:00,992
have largely decomposed.

344
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:07,030
There is residual lung tissue
on the inner aspect

345
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:09,991
of the chest wall. Histology.

346
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,790
Moving back to the face now...

347
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:37,988
What's that? Cosmetic surgery.

348
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,029
Bilateral and symmetrical.

349
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,109
With viscous filler still present.

350
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:49,267
I understand the need
for plastic surgery,

351
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:52,507
but cosmetic surgery, why?

352
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:55,667
What do they hope to
create, what image?

353
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:58,108
We struggle to see ourselves
for who we are.

354
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:03,067
Can I take a look at the CT scan,
please, Velvy? Mm-hm.

355
00:23:19,826 --> 00:23:21,625
JACK: We could check for DNA

356
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:23,906
from the swabs taken
at the crime scene.

357
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:29,265
This is the insect staining
I explained to you.

358
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:33,544
We have to prep these samples.

359
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,265
OK.

360
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:38,264
Yeah, I knew that one.

361
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:46,184
OK, copy what I do.

362
00:24:16,381 --> 00:24:17,701
Mm-hm.

363
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,501
Again.

364
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:28,060
There are several areas
on the CT scan

365
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:30,339
of the skull that look equivocal.

366
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,779
It could be fractures,

367
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,700
or could just be imaging artefacts.

368
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,659
Mm, it's not very clear.

369
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,259
I need to strip the tissue
from the bones,

370
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,979
without damaging them.

371
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,058
I'll call the coroner.

372
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:44,899
We're doing an enzyme bath.

373
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:48,498
I've never seen that before!

374
00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:50,619
They're not done very often.

375
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:06,938
Silicone doesn't decay.

376
00:25:08,097 --> 00:25:09,936
VELVY: So, gas chromatography.

377
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:11,576
Mm. In theory,

378
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:14,017
we should be able to match it
to the source.

379
00:25:15,857 --> 00:25:17,696
The silicone in the prosthetics

380
00:25:17,697 --> 00:25:19,696
are largely manufactured abroad.

381
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:22,375
There's a chance we can match
the liquid silicone

382
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:24,175
to the right batch, if we can get

383
00:25:24,176 --> 00:25:26,096
another sample to compare it to.

384
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:35,615
Nikki...take a look at this.

385
00:25:41,615 --> 00:25:44,335
Samples from the remnants of
Paula's lung tissue.

386
00:25:45,855 --> 00:25:47,773
There's silicone in
the blood vessels.

387
00:25:47,774 --> 00:25:52,053
And in her system, travelling
around her body when she was alive.

388
00:25:52,054 --> 00:25:53,893
The surgery could have killed her.

389
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:58,134
I've never seen a case of
silicone embolism before. Have you?

390
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:17,851
Hmm! In the December
before she died,

391
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:19,491
Paula took out a loan

392
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:23,051
for £15,000 and three
credit cards on the same day,

393
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:25,291
maxed them out within hours.

394
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,890
She paid three grand

395
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:29,610
to Nu-Sculpt
Medical Aesthetics Clinic.

396
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:31,210
Three grand to be a new you.

397
00:26:31,211 --> 00:26:32,731
Yeah. Bargain!

398
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:35,650
She took out
five additional credit cards

399
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:38,290
the following month,
missed all the payments,

400
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,169
got herself blacklisted and
couldn't pass a credit check

401
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,409
for a place to live. I can see
all the credit searches right here.

402
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,689
What happened to the £15,000?

403
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,170
Vanished without a trace.

404
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,088
Found it!

405
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:57,249
"Cause of death -
silicone embolism."

406
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:04,649
GABRIEL: First, add
the biological washing powder.

407
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:11,567
Now, the water.

408
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:14,207
We change the water frequently,
to replenish

409
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,767
the proteolytic enzymes

410
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,847
present in the washing powder.

411
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,086
Right.

412
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:23,366
The enzyme solution
cleans the skeleton

413
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:25,246
of any soft tissue,

414
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:27,687
then we examine the bones
in greater detail.

415
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:13,523
Locks.
LOCKS CLICK

416
00:28:14,763 --> 00:28:16,562
What, er, temperature?

417
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:18,043
37 degrees.

418
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:28,802
Now, we wait.

419
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,799
SHE SIGHS

420
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,838
GIRL: One, two, three, four, five...

421
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,759
Paula, you've got to hide!

422
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,038
..eight, nine, ten.
I'm coming to get you!

423
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,238
YOUNG PAULA: You won't
find me. I'm invisible!

424
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:35,557
SPOON CLINKS IN MUG

425
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,757
HE SIGHS

426
00:29:47,716 --> 00:29:48,956
BARBARA: Oh!

427
00:29:52,676 --> 00:29:54,395
Cosmetic surgery gone wrong.

428
00:29:56,715 --> 00:29:59,034
Why do people
put themselves through it?

429
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:01,075
It's just not worth the risk. Hmm.

430
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:12,193
WOMAN: Thank you for coming
so early.

431
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:14,993
No problem, Mrs Frank.
See you Thursday.

432
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:16,674
Yeah, see you Thursday.

433
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,672
Hi, it's Tasha Jackson.

434
00:30:26,673 --> 00:30:28,952
Er, yeah, I just got a text.

435
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,472
I don't know a Mr Scrubs.

436
00:30:31,473 --> 00:30:33,151
MAN: He's a new client.

437
00:30:33,152 --> 00:30:34,991
Oh! Right, I see.

438
00:30:34,992 --> 00:30:36,511
A two-hour tidy?

439
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:38,512
Yes. Yeah, OK.

440
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:48,030
This shows the silicone
in the blood vessels.

441
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:51,270
Paula had undergone
a recent cosmetic procedure

442
00:30:51,271 --> 00:30:54,830
in which fat harvested
from her body is injected

443
00:30:54,831 --> 00:30:57,150
into the area of the gluteus,
a gluteoplasty.

444
00:30:57,151 --> 00:30:59,149
A Brazilian butt lift.

445
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,389
Some practitioners
use silicone illegally

446
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,349
because it's cheaper and quicker.

447
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,789
You can clearly see
the silicone deposits in this area.

448
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,389
It's a particularly
dangerous procedure.

449
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,988
It's easy to hit a major artery
there, if you don't know

450
00:31:11,989 --> 00:31:15,148
what you're doing.
Can it be fatal? It can, yes.

451
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:18,388
Four years ago, another
young woman, Kate Black,

452
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:21,868
died a few weeks after having
this same procedure.

453
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:25,027
The recorded death
was silicone embolism.

454
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,947
The silicone
got into her circulation

455
00:31:26,948 --> 00:31:28,467
and travelled around the body,

456
00:31:28,468 --> 00:31:30,227
causing blockages and blood clots,

457
00:31:30,228 --> 00:31:32,867
which are potentially fatal
in the brain and lungs.

458
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:34,307
Was the clinic investigated?

459
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:39,146
Yes, but Kate Black had
an undiagnosed heart issue,

460
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,466
so it couldn't be proven
definitively if she died from

461
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:46,547
the existing heart condition
or from the silicone embolism.

462
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:50,386
The silicone in Paula's body...

463
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:54,185
..has an identical chemical profile.

464
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:55,626
And now, Paula's dead as well.

465
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:12,624
SHE KNOCKS
Hello!

466
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,625
LDN Diamond Cleaning.

467
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:18,543
SHE KNOCKS AGAIN

468
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:19,743
Hello?

469
00:32:19,744 --> 00:32:21,184
Mr Scrubs?

470
00:32:29,223 --> 00:32:31,022
You can call me Wormwood.

471
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:32,783
Are you pleased to see me?

472
00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:40,662
Leave me alone, Roy.

473
00:32:40,663 --> 00:32:42,461
Don't talk to me.

474
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:43,862
She owes me money.

475
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,221
Piss off! You're going to pay me.

476
00:32:48,222 --> 00:32:50,741
You're going to pay,
one way or another.

477
00:32:50,742 --> 00:32:52,182
I want to see him.

478
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:55,221
I have a right.

479
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:06,301
ENGINE STARTS

480
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:27,938
You ever think about
a little, er...?

481
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,418
HE WHISTLES
My husband seems to like me

482
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:34,497
how I am, so who am I to blow
against the wind? Aw! That's nice.

483
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:37,377
You could probably do with some work
around the eyes, though. Hmm?

484
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:41,017
Maybe some filler, plump up
those thin lips of yours.

485
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:44,177
Or you should just let
nature take its course.

486
00:33:44,178 --> 00:33:46,857
Probably best go with nature.
Yeah, I think so.

487
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,296
Meryam Parlak?

488
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:50,976
I'm Detective Inspector Torres.
This is Jack Hodgson.

489
00:33:50,977 --> 00:33:52,817
I'm so sorry to have kept you.

490
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:57,936
We wanted to ask you about
a patient of yours, Paula Jackson.

491
00:33:57,937 --> 00:34:00,975
I'm afraid I can't speak
about specific patients.

492
00:34:00,976 --> 00:34:03,295
Confidentiality. You understand.

493
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:05,695
It would have been over a
year ago now. We believe

494
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,335
you may have performed buttock
enhancement surgery on her.

495
00:34:08,336 --> 00:34:11,335
Is there anything else I can help
you with? How about Kate Black?

496
00:34:11,336 --> 00:34:15,094
Do you remember her?
Nothing was proven. So I hear.

497
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,174
Must have been a very difficult
time for you, professionally.

498
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:20,855
Not something you'd be keen
to experience again.

499
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:39,532
DOOR SLAMS

500
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:42,293
SHE FUMBLES WITH LOCK

501
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:48,093
SHE BREATHES SHAKILY

502
00:34:54,412 --> 00:34:56,052
Now I know where you live.

503
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,931
KNOCK ON DOOR

504
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:13,131
KNOCK ON DOOR

505
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,249
Mum?

506
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,170
Sorry. Forgot my keys.

507
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,849
A-star in maths today.

508
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,728
I got so much love for that
from Mr Ambler.

509
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,809
MUSIC PLAYS FAINTLY
THROUGH HEADPHONES

510
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:41,448
Mum?

511
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:42,849
Are you OK?

512
00:35:44,048 --> 00:35:45,727
Uh...

513
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,528
Bad day at work.

514
00:35:48,808 --> 00:35:50,968
SHE LOCKS DOOR

515
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,166
Are you a doctor, Ms Parlak?
In Turkey, yes.

516
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:59,726
Not here?

517
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:02,286
Here, I'm a medical technician.

518
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:05,046
I'm able to perform
some cosmetic procedures.

519
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:07,166
Do you do Brazilian butt lifts?

520
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,246
We don't call it that, but, yes,

521
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:11,686
we can do gluteoplasty here.

522
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:14,046
Are you interested?

523
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,325
Paula Jackson was found
deceased a few days ago.

524
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:20,405
What's that got to do
with Nu-Sculpt?

525
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:22,565
We need a sample of
the silicone you use

526
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:25,164
for your butt lift procedure.
Gluteoplasty.

527
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:28,324
We don't use silicone for that
procedure. But you do use silicone?

528
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:30,084
It's pretty standard
in cosmetic work.

529
00:36:30,085 --> 00:36:31,844
Yeah. Could we have
a sample, please?

530
00:36:31,845 --> 00:36:35,044
Then we can eliminate you from
our inquiries. What inquiries?

531
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:36,323
Into Paula Jackson's death.

532
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:38,323
I could get a warrant,
if you prefer.

533
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:39,683
Your call.

534
00:36:39,684 --> 00:36:43,083
All my clients sign a consent form.

535
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:45,084
They are aware of the risks.

536
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,323
Thank you.

537
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:59,562
What's this, Spanish?
It's not illegal.

538
00:36:59,563 --> 00:37:01,722
Glad to hear it. I'll be in touch.

539
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:06,001
How about you?

540
00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:07,522
HE CHUCKLES

541
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:26,720
Paula Jackson was convicted

542
00:37:26,721 --> 00:37:28,720
and sent to prison
for drug offences.

543
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Her DNA will be on the register.

544
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,240
Hmm...

545
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,199
Blood results from the rug are back.

546
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,959
PHONE RINGS
Is it a match?

547
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,718
Yep.

548
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,958
We need to speak to Torres.

549
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,198
OK. I'll be right there.

550
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,519
Body's ready.

551
00:38:12,237 --> 00:38:14,596
DNA from the blood in the rug's
a familial match

552
00:38:14,597 --> 00:38:17,197
to Natasha Jackson.
It's Paula Jackson's blood.

553
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:24,115
A high-impact fracture.

554
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:26,076
Accidental? Unlikely.

555
00:38:27,116 --> 00:38:29,115
There's a depression wound,

556
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:30,636
just here.

557
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:39,314
That's the likely cause of
death - blunt-force trauma,

558
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:42,795
leading to a subdural
haematoma...and death.

559
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,674
Now it's a murder investigation.

560
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:06,232
Hey, Kevin. Hi, Leo.

561
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:08,552
My superhero! You all right?

562
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:10,272
Yeah, all right. Are you?

563
00:39:10,273 --> 00:39:12,191
Yeah. I'm fine.

564
00:39:12,192 --> 00:39:15,591
If you need anything,
you know, I'm here to help.

565
00:39:15,592 --> 00:39:17,511
You know, with anything. I'm good.

566
00:39:17,512 --> 00:39:19,512
Thanks, Kev. I'm here, you know?

567
00:39:20,512 --> 00:39:22,471
I know. Thanks, Kev.

568
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:25,431
Be careful, OK? Back at ya.

569
00:39:35,031 --> 00:39:36,910
Hey! Hey.

570
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:39,469
You got a regular game you running?
I'm looking for one.

571
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,069
Nah. Guys just show up at the park

572
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,150
and join in. Cool.

573
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,750
Who's whitey? Kevin.

574
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,588
He's my aunt's friend.

575
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,468
He likes to think
he's looking after me.

576
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:55,308
White saviour? Yeah, whatever.

577
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,868
He's always been real
with me, though.

578
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:00,149
Anyway, I've got to go.

579
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:03,388
All right, Leo.

580
00:40:06,748 --> 00:40:08,348
How do you know my name?

581
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:23,786
I've documented and processed
all the insect staining

582
00:40:23,787 --> 00:40:25,427
from the bedroom
at the crime scene.

583
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,066
Appears to be normal.

584
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:30,625
Depositing matter from
the decomposing body clustered in

585
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:32,705
any area of warmth and light.

586
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:37,065
We're running DNA from the swabs,
in case the tooth yields no results.

587
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:40,386
There must have been hundreds
of insects. No-one noticed?

588
00:40:41,386 --> 00:40:45,424
Toxicology confirms that
Paula Jackson was taking

589
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:48,184
corticosteroids in the months
before her death.

590
00:40:48,185 --> 00:40:50,224
It was in her hair. She had asthma.

591
00:40:50,225 --> 00:40:51,704
It could have been for her asthma.

592
00:40:51,705 --> 00:40:53,424
Seems a severe course of action.

593
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:56,663
I agree. And her sister said
that it was being controlled

594
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,504
successfully with normal medication.

595
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:03,103
If she was living with the results
of silicone in her lungs,

596
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:06,303
she may well have been
started on corticosteroids.

597
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,742
She would have had
all sorts of health problems.

598
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:12,702
There is an old fracture
in the left leg.

599
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:16,102
Pins. An internal fixation

600
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:17,702
screwed into the femur.

601
00:41:17,703 --> 00:41:19,062
Road accident?

602
00:41:19,063 --> 00:41:20,342
No road traffic accidents

603
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:22,101
on Paula's NHS records.

604
00:41:22,102 --> 00:41:23,901
No internal fixations at all.

605
00:41:23,902 --> 00:41:25,421
Happened abroad? Mm.

606
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:27,182
Possible, I guess.

607
00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:31,101
The depressed skull fracture.

608
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:34,980
The break is 1.6 centimetres long.

609
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:36,501
Would she have bled out from that?

610
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:38,900
Perhaps. No.

611
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,900
Crime scene doesn't fit. Blood
was on the floor, not on the bed.

612
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:44,020
No blood in her hair.
How big were her feet?

613
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:46,780
Around a five, I would say,
possibly six.

614
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:49,419
Mm-hm. I lifted a partial
footprint from this scene,

615
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,179
indicative of a size nine.
They'd stepped in wet blood.

616
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,139
Someone else was there
the night Paula died. Apparently.

617
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,099
So Paula was attacked
and then her body was moved?

618
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,338
Who moved it? Her assailant,

619
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:02,098
who was wearing a size-nine boot?

620
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:04,818
Speculation, but it
fits the evidence.

621
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:06,378
Gabriel?

622
00:42:06,379 --> 00:42:07,738
Have you got a minute?

623
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:09,938
I'll be with you in a second.
We're almost done.

624
00:42:09,939 --> 00:42:13,618
Er, I think you need to see this.
I'll take a look in a moment.

625
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:27,417
DNA results from the tooth
we extracted. Mm-hm.

626
00:42:34,537 --> 00:42:36,377
Our body isn't Paula Jackson.

627
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:50,775
Kevin is still out there,
hanging. Is he OK?

628
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,214
We know him and everything,

629
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:55,415
but with people, he scares them.

630
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:02,735
Mum, everything's going to be fine.

631
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,173
Don't worry.

632
00:43:06,174 --> 00:43:09,293
Leo, that...that man
you were talking to...

633
00:43:09,294 --> 00:43:11,693
The guy who stopped me?

634
00:43:11,694 --> 00:43:12,933
What did he say?

635
00:43:12,934 --> 00:43:15,013
He was just talking shit.

636
00:43:15,014 --> 00:43:18,052
I mean, he wanted to play
basketball or something.

637
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,733
Seemed like he knew me.
I mean, he knew my name.

638
00:43:22,573 --> 00:43:24,252
Stay away from him.

639
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:26,212
OK.

640
00:43:26,213 --> 00:43:27,652
Why? Who is he?

641
00:43:27,653 --> 00:43:29,212
He's a devil.

642
00:43:29,213 --> 00:43:30,733
He's evil.

643
00:43:32,532 --> 00:43:34,731
He got your auntie hooked.

644
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:36,891
Stole her money. Destroyed her.

645
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:40,011
OK. Stay away from him.
If he offers you anything,

646
00:43:40,012 --> 00:43:43,251
don't take it. Don't speak to him.
OK, I...I get it.

647
00:43:43,252 --> 00:43:45,410
I won't let him come for you.

648
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:47,691
He's the past. You're the future.

649
00:43:48,931 --> 00:43:51,651
If he tries to harm you,
I will kill him!

650
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:56,571
LEO EXHALES SHARPLY

651
00:44:14,129 --> 00:44:17,048
DNA matches a young woman
with a criminal record

652
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:20,208
for petty crimes,
financial crimes, fraud.

653
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:21,608
Spent a year in prison.

654
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:23,888
She's called Casey Lennox.

655
00:44:26,168 --> 00:44:28,687
So, where's Paula?
Is she still alive?

656
00:44:28,688 --> 00:44:31,807
It would be extremely hard to
survive the arterial bleed she had.

657
00:44:31,808 --> 00:44:34,087
VELVY: I checked with
all the local A&E

658
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,086
departments, urgent-care centres.

659
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:40,006
No injury of this kind was reported
for anyone matching

660
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:43,286
Paula's description during
our possible time period.

661
00:44:43,287 --> 00:44:45,646
Was Casey Lennox murdered?

662
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:47,446
Were Paula and Casey
known to each other?

663
00:44:47,447 --> 00:44:49,005
Yeah, what's the connection?

664
00:44:49,006 --> 00:44:50,485
JACK: We don't know. But we do know

665
00:44:50,486 --> 00:44:52,885
there were three people
in the flat that night -

666
00:44:52,886 --> 00:44:54,805
the woman in the bed, Paula,

667
00:44:54,806 --> 00:44:56,565
and whoever took Paula's body away.

668
00:44:56,566 --> 00:44:58,685
Where are you going, Torres?
To work.

669
00:44:58,686 --> 00:45:00,046
You coming?

670
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,685
JACK SIGHS

FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

672
00:45:13,285 --> 00:45:15,603
Hi! Hi.

673
00:45:15,604 --> 00:45:17,483
Didn't think I'd be back, did you?

674
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:20,763
I didn't know what to think.
Do you do before-and-after photos

675
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:22,283
for all your patients? Of course.

676
00:45:22,284 --> 00:45:24,843
Can I look at before-and-after
photos of Paula Jackson?

677
00:45:24,844 --> 00:45:27,523
I know - confidentiality, GDPR,

678
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,122
all that bollocks.

679
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:31,642
It'd be a lot easier
than asking a court.

680
00:45:31,643 --> 00:45:33,882
And it would show goodwill,

681
00:45:33,883 --> 00:45:36,362
which would be smart for you
at this particular moment.

682
00:45:36,363 --> 00:45:39,122
I could be shut down.
Oh, I think you're going to be

683
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:41,762
shut down anyway.
It's whether you go to prison.

684
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:50,362
See? Told you she liked you.

685
00:45:51,642 --> 00:45:53,361
I'm guessing Casey Lennox. You?

686
00:45:53,362 --> 00:45:56,640
Eight credit cards, 15,000 quid and
a butt lift? I'm guessing she stole

687
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:58,801
Paula Jackson's identity
and her money. Yep.

688
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,159
Here.

689
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,399
Thanks.

690
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,279
Casey's medical records say
that she had a car accident

691
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,719
about seven years ago.

692
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,079
Oh, the pinned fracture?

693
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,199
She struggled with body dysmorphia,

694
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,558
mental illness, she'd
been in chronic pain,

695
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:24,878
lung problems,
all caused by the silicone.

696
00:46:24,879 --> 00:46:26,598
Corticosteroids.

697
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:29,198
According to this, Casey's GP

698
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,159
wrote a letter for her last April.

699
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,277
She was gathering evidence
to take her surgeon to court.

700
00:46:35,278 --> 00:46:37,118
Wow!

701
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:45,277
Martin Piler. How did you find him?

702
00:46:45,278 --> 00:46:47,036
His car's registered here.

703
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,316
And he has Universal Credit
housing allowance

704
00:46:49,317 --> 00:46:51,836
for 32 properties
from all over the country,

705
00:46:51,837 --> 00:46:54,636
paid to a bank account with
this address. Count the laws

706
00:46:54,637 --> 00:46:57,876
that have been broken! The flat
where we found Casey Lennox's body

707
00:46:57,877 --> 00:46:59,315
isn't on that list.

708
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,355
How was he paid? We'll find out.

709
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:04,675
DOORBELL RINGS
Martin Piler's about to discover

710
00:47:04,676 --> 00:47:07,636
a whole new world of pain.
Let's see if he has size-nine boots.

711
00:47:10,556 --> 00:47:12,675
Can I help? Martin Piler?

712
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:16,994
Yeah.
I'm Detective Inspector Torres.

713
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:20,154
There's been a death
in one of your flats.

714
00:47:20,155 --> 00:47:21,354
Paula Jackson?

715
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:23,554
I don't know a Paula Jackson.

716
00:47:23,555 --> 00:47:25,434
Casey Lennox?

717
00:47:28,354 --> 00:47:31,233
I don't remember
meeting her, but...

718
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:32,994
Yeah, yeah, that name, yeah.

719
00:47:37,513 --> 00:47:39,312
York Road. Yeah.

720
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,352
She's dead.

721
00:47:41,353 --> 00:47:43,073
This is a murder inquiry.

722
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,193
When? About a year ago.

723
00:47:47,153 --> 00:47:48,833
Just found her body.

724
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:51,431
No-one checked on her.

725
00:47:51,432 --> 00:47:52,872
Her body just laid there.

726
00:47:55,632 --> 00:47:58,071
Well, I didn't hear from her,
but that's not unusual.

727
00:47:58,072 --> 00:48:00,391
Just out of interest, why
didn't you check up on her

728
00:48:00,392 --> 00:48:03,430
when she stopped paying the rent?
Well, she didn't stop

729
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:07,550
paying her rent.
Direct debit? No, cash.

730
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,270
Envelope through the letterbox.
Cash?

731
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:12,151
Useful for tax.

WOMAN: Martin Piler? We're here
from DWP fraud investigation.

735
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:01,346
Torres, how many bedside tables
have you got?

736
00:49:01,347 --> 00:49:02,867
Um...

737
00:49:04,267 --> 00:49:08,185
Like most couples, we have...two.

738
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:10,465
How many lamps?
We are a symmetrical household.

739
00:49:10,466 --> 00:49:11,705
Does that mean two? Yes.

740
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:14,386
Can you just say, "two"?
Thought we were having fun.

741
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:20,945
You think the missing lamp
is the murder weapon?

742
00:49:20,946 --> 00:49:22,744
I think the missing lamp is missing,

743
00:49:22,745 --> 00:49:24,144
and that begs a question.

744
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:25,865
Who cleaned up? Yeah.

745
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:28,545
Size-nine boots.

746
00:49:30,105 --> 00:49:32,185
Sorry, sir, you can't be in here.

747
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:21,740
Tell me - why did you feel
the need to chase him?

748
00:50:21,741 --> 00:50:24,500
I see God gave you muscles,
but no speed.

749
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:26,139
I'm wearing a paper suit.

750
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,819
Everybody's got an excuse! Yeah.

753
00:50:40,939 --> 00:50:42,459
WOMAN SHOUTS OUT

754
00:51:03,218 --> 00:51:04,937
JACK: DNA from the blood in the rug

755
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:07,336
is a familial match
to Natasha Jackson.

756
00:51:07,337 --> 00:51:08,977
It's Paula Jackson's blood.

757
00:51:11,377 --> 00:51:13,896
NIKKI: It would be
extremely hard to survive

758
00:51:13,897 --> 00:51:15,536
the arterial bleed she had.

759

760
00:51:30,016 --> 00:51:32,455
JACK: There were three people
in the flat that night.

761
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:51,733
NIKKI: It's the likely
cause of death -

762
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,453
blunt-force trauma, leading to

763
00:51:53,454 --> 00:51:55,453
a subdural haematoma...

764
00:51:55,454 --> 00:51:57,812
WOMAN CRIES OUT
..and death.

765
00:51:57,813 --> 00:52:01,172
I think the base of the missing lamp

766
00:52:01,173 --> 00:52:02,653
could be the murder weapon.

KNOCK ON DOOR

768
00:52:11,092 --> 00:52:12,692
I called them.

769
00:52:20,932 --> 00:52:22,772
You need to talk to them.

770
00:52:25,051 --> 00:52:26,890
NATASHA: I hadn't seen him
for years.

771
00:52:26,891 --> 00:52:29,330
This happens to Paula
and then, suddenly, he arrives.

772
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:30,610
Roy?

773
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:32,611
He said she owes him money.

774
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:36,169
I did this to her.

775
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,850
I forced her back to him.

776
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,809
She said she wanted to meet up,

777
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,929
and I thought she'd changed,
but she hadn't.

778
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,489
She was desperate for money.

779
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,929
PAULA: It's not my fault.

780
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,369
Hmm...

781
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,568
How much do you owe?

782
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:52,008
15,000.

783
00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:54,048
Get out, Paula! Get out!

784
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:55,409
I'm begging you.

785
00:52:56,929 --> 00:52:58,129
I'm begging...

786
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:01,088
It must have been for drugs.

787
00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:03,447
She said she owed people
and it wasn't her fault.

788
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:05,087
Same as always.

789
00:53:05,088 --> 00:53:08,207
She wanted to get a flat.
She asked me for help,

790
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:11,407
but I'd done enough.
I'd done enough!

791
00:53:11,408 --> 00:53:16,047
We think she was a victim of
identity theft, or coercion.

792
00:53:19,887 --> 00:53:22,247
The body we found isn't Paula.

793
00:53:25,807 --> 00:53:27,685
Where is she?

794
00:53:27,686 --> 00:53:29,366
We don't know.

795
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,485
JACK: Even a partial footprint
can tell us a lot.

796
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:46,724
Look, with the AI,
we can get a clear image

797
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:49,444
of the footprint.
Took this at the crime scene.

798
00:53:49,445 --> 00:53:51,405
Might shed light on
the third person.
