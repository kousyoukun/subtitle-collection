2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,600
- WOMAN ON COMPUTER:
Good crumb. Not too chewy.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,360
- Hey, hey.
- I'd say it could
be the seventh best―

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,840
- Oh, smooth. What is
it? Something juicy?

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,360
- Dumb video. You'd hate it.
- Honestly, bro, it's, um...

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,960
- Go on ― play it.
- (SIGHS)
- WEAKLY: Mm-kay.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,920
- Hi. I'm Briar Lee.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,920
I'm at Reuben's Cafe,

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,720
where the harbour glimpses
are super-pretty,

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,560
and I'm looking forward to
breakfast. Who am I kidding?
It's very late brunch.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,080
- Oh, I recognise her.
She's a food critic.
- Influencer.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,040
- Main man Reuben behind
the counter is a total dilf.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,840
- (CHUCKLES)
- D is for 'dude', right?
- It's absolutely D for 'dad'.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,040
- Well,... (SCOFFS) obviously
not, because I don't have any―

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,040
- My sourdough.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
- (CRUNCHES)

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,400
The sourdough is maybe not quite
as exciting as the pastry offerings.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,880
- 'Not quite'?
- Good crumb. Not too chewy.

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I say it could be the seventh
best sourdough loaf in Auckland.

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
This side of Auckland.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
(FUNK MUSIC)

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
- Hey.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,360
- I nearly gave up this time.
- Oh, yeah. I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,040
I just had to comment on a video.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,640
Talk to me about a case ―
anything but bread.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,800
- Actually, there may be
some bread in this one.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,000
Bakery delivery van was
found at dawn on Tuesday,

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,600
three weeks ago, in a
lake near Rangiriri.
- Mm-hm.

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,080
- Josh Boyer was found inside.

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,960
They pulled the van out of the
water, but he was already dead.

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,840
Josh was 28 years old.
Part-time security guard,

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,040
also worked in a shop and on
deliveries for his fiancee,

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,320
Steph Rozentals.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,920
- Wait. Steph Rozentals?
Of Rozentals Bakery?

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,480
- Yeah, I thought you
might've heard of her.
- Oh, finest sourdough in Auckland,

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,920
according to some.
- They make a pretty
mean Portuguese tart.

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,080
- Yes, well, Portuguese
tarts are mean.

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,160
They've got bugger all
custard and even less tart.

39
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,200
Coroner's report?
- Death by drowning.

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,160
They found water in his lungs.
Also traces of flour.

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,440
Occupational hazard, I guess.
- What kind of flour?

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,960
- Wheat, I think.

43
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,080
- You know, it says here that
Josh Boyer was a Navy diver.

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,640
Well, he'd know how to get out of a
sinking car. And blunt force trauma?

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,600
- Consistent with hitting his head
on the back panel of the cabin,

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,080
as he left the road.
- OK, well,

47
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
it looks like an accident, then.

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,200
- Time of death was
between 3am and 4am.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Maybe he fell asleep at the wheel,

50
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,440
banged his head as he hit the water.

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,680
- So why is this loaf
not rising for you,

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,240
detective?

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,320
- This is a delivery down south,

54
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,560
to some cafes that
Steph Rozentals supplies ―

55
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,880
you know, normal run, normal time.

56
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,160
It just seems odd that Josh
would fall asleep at the wheel

57
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,120
an hour into a drive he'd
done plenty of times before.

58
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,240
- You have a suspect.

59
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,040
Steph didn't divorce her
husband until a year ago ―

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Zachary Rozentals.

61
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,320
They were a team,
ran the shop together.

62
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,480
Famously feisty the whole time ―

63
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
they were either fighting each other

64
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,400
or behind the proofing cabinets,
doing something else.

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
- Bakers are a passionate lot.

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,080
- Well, that has been my experience.

67
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
- What were the Rozentals
doing that night?

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,160
- Phone records place them both in
their respective bakeries all night,

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,720
and they opened as per usual,
so the bread got baked.

70
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,400
- And the Portuguese tarts too?

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,480
- So you gonna take a look?

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,880
- There are 20 varieties of
wheat grown around the world,

73
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,560
Harry, and seven species. So...

74
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,960
when I ask about wheat...
- I have more homework to do.

75
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
- That's right.

79
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,400
- Paint me a picture of Josh Boyer's
life in the month before he died.

80
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,400
- On it. Josh is
all over the socials.

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,000
All of them. Never met a breakfast
he didn't wanna photograph.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,280
And he spends a lot
of time in gym shorts.

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,800
Alexa?
- Help me out here.

84
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,080
There seem to be two
Rozentals bakeries.

85
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,040
- Zachary Rozentals set up a
rival one after the divorce.

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,920
- Which is which? I wanna
talk to Steph Rozentals.

87
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,280
- They don't say. Both shops
claim they're the OG.

88
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
- OK.

89
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,480
(BELL TINKLES)

90
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,960
Hi. Can I talk to
Steph Rozentals, please?

91
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
- Hey, if second-rate breads
are what you're after, then,

92
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
yeah, Steph's definitely...
(CHUCKLES) who you need.

93
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,440
- I think maybe I came
in the wrong store.

94
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,640
- No, no. Not if you want
good bread, you haven't.

95
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,320
- (CHUCKLES) You must be Zachary,

96
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,960
and I'll make my own judgement
about bread, thank you.

97
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,840
Can I have a sourdough loaf, please?

98
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,120
- I feel like I know you.

99
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Where have we met?

100
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
- Previous life?
- Yeah.

101
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,320
- SOFTLY: When you
were more charming.

102
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Thank you.

103
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
(DING-DONG!)
- Morena.

104
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
- Morena.

105
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,640
Wow. I've heard so much about
the sourdough in this place.

106
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,920
That Steph Rozentals really has
got the magic touch, hasn't she?

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,640
Or is this your work too?
- Oh, no, I leave the bread to them.
I mean, Steph, I mean.

108
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,480
- Oh, you're the pastry chef.
- Milo's the name,
40 years in the game.

109
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,840
- (CHUCKLES)
- But you can call me
'My-lo'. Everyone does.

110
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,680
- Hi, Milo. Ooh, can I have
one of your custard tarts?

111
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,880
- No, no. You may have one
of my Portuguese tarts,

112
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,600
made with puff pastry and cinnamon.
- Perfect.

113
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,040
Oh, and the potato
sourdough too, please.

114
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,840
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, here she is.

115
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Hi. Hi. Big fan.

116
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,360
I'm Alexa. I'm a bit
of a bread tragic,

117
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,280
I'm afraid, and dabble in sourdough
myself from time to time.
- OK.

118
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Hi.
- Gosh, I would love to get a look
at the engine room in this place.

119
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,760
- Oh, no customers in
the kitchen. Sorry.

120
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,680
- Oh, I'm not snooping for secrets.
I've kind of got a few of my own,
actually. (CHUCKLES)

121
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,480
- I'm sure. (CHUCKLES)
- It's just that I'm really

122
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,960
fascinated by equipment
at this scale.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,560
I use a Lupenschwegen at home.
- A Lupe? Wow.

124
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,080
I had one of those years ago.
It's a beautiful machine,

125
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,480
but if anything goes wrong,
you have to ring Dusseldorf.
- Tell me about it.

126
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,800
I had to teach myself German just to
get through to the customer service
department.

127
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,360
Schnell! You know. (LAUGHS)
- (CHUCKLES)

128
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,360
So in a shift, we do 80
kilos of white bread,

129
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,880
160kg of sourdough.
- 160?
- Yep.

130
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,360
40kg wholemeal, 40kg multigrain.

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,440
- Wow. What kind of flour do you use?

132
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,680
- A good local organic.

133
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,600
It's not about the flour.
It's all about technique.

134
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,560
And with sourdough,
the quality of the starter.
- Yeah, true that.

135
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,720
I've been nurturing my sourdough
starter for the last 18 months.

136
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,360
- Well, the Rozentals Bakery
starter goes back 70 years.

137
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,800
- It's been in your family that
long? Like, three generations?

138
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,680
- Well, yeah. My husband's family ―

139
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,280
his grandmother's, but I got
it in the divorce settlement.

140
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,160
- You've been in the wars recently.

141
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,920
I was really sorry to
read about your fiance.

142
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,920
- Yeah. Yeah, it's been, um...

143
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,680
it's been tough. Josh was...

144
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,160
(CHUCKLES RUEFULLY)
I can't believe he's gone.

145
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,560
- Was it a whirlwind romance?

146
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
- Yeah, he, um...

147
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,240
He'd stop by late on
his security rounds.

148
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,720
And then he started coming for the
best coffee in Auckland. (CHUCKLES)

149
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
- (CHUCKLES) A likely story.

150
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,400
- Yeah, it's not very good ―
it's true. We've had bad reviews.

151
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,000
- Oh, not by that Briar Lee,
the Bread Whisperer?

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
- Might have been.

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,560
But Josh was just so
sweet and attentive,

154
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
and...

155
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,680
you know, he took me up on
a hot-air balloon to propose.

156
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,560
That was just a week before...

157
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,600
his, um... his accident.

158
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,280
- Well, sweet and attentive works.

159
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,960
Especially after your husband.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,480
- You met him, then.
- Well, I accidentally
went in the shop earlier.

161
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
- He is an unbelievable idiot.

162
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,480
He thinks getting a fancy coffee
machine's gonna give him edge.

163
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,160
But if you want second-rate
bread, he is your man.

164

- Well, it definitely wasn't―
- No, I think it was you.

- Oh, this is going well.
- Oh, shut up, Zachary.

- Is that Josh?
- Yeah.

And Josh seems awfully protective.

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,520
- It's kind of sweet the
way he swoops in there.

to look after herself.

You know, she said that
the store had been reviewed.

You know, there's millers here that
import this stuff, and then grind it
locally.

It's all about you now.

about Josh and more about Zachary
Rozentals.

I think that the flour found in
Josh's lungs came from Zachary's
kitchen.

262
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,720
- So he was there the night he died.
- Which means that somebody's lying.

we found in Josh's lungs.

And yes, they were inhaled
not long before he died.

What about motive?

- Imagine how he feels about Steph.
I mean, divorce can be toxic, right?

273
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,880
So maybe killing Josh was payback.

274
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,720
- Or he just didn't like Josh
moving in on his ex-wife.

Josh went over to your ex-husband's
bakery that night.

whole time. I checked on him.

I saw him off,

295
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,720
and then he drove
towards the motorway,

296

He hadn't rested, and...

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,200
he'd been to the gym,
and then he went out to Piha,

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,880

He only just joined me recently.

- Zachary sacked him actually.
He had some sort of meltdown.

310
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,440
He's a bloody idiot.
Don't ask me why.
- Well, that seems weird,

because Milo worked for
you guys for years.

that's why I snapped him up.

sack Milo exactly?

- Um, couldn't be completely sure,

315
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
but, um, maybe the...

316
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
15th?
- Well,

317
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,920
the 15th is the date
of Josh's accident.

You'd fired Milo. What had he done?

323
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,720
- It was just that was an impulse
thing. I was shaking things up.

324
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,880
Milo had been working here
forever, and I've got...

325
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
I've got young Marigold now, so...

326
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,560
- You sacked him without notice.

327
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,200
Did he freak out? Did Josh
walk in in the middle of it?

328
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
- Well, I sacked Milo by text.

329
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,600
And what's Josh got to do with it?

330
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,200
- Your favourite flour
was found in Josh's lungs.

331
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
He was here that night.

332
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
- He wasn't.

333
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,160
And that flour really
isn't that rare.

334
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,720
Actually, have you checked
to see if Steph uses it?

335
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,560
- I think we both know that Steph
doesn't use hand-milled, imported
French grain.

336
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,120
- OK, well, the guy probably snorted
it up his nose somewhere else.

337
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,000
Look, boyfriend was a little bit
of a try-hard. Probably up for
anything.

338
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,080
- That boyfriend was Steph's fiance.

339
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
And she's suffering.

340
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,240
You didn't know he was the fiance?
- Yeah.

341
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Of course I did.

342
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,040
OK, sure. Yeah, all right.
Steph's had a rough time.

343
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,760
Doesn't mean that she doesn't
have the hide of a rhino.

344
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,200
- The GPS data backs up Steph.
Josh's phone was in the city,

345
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
then out at Piha, and then
at the bakery until 2am.

346
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
- Anything interesting in his texts?

347
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,920
- There's a lot to Steph with love
hearts. Like, he's a total simp.

348
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,320
- Mm-hm. I think the
word is 'uxorious'.

349
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,600
- Hey, I've found Briar Lee's review
of Steph's place in an archive.

350
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,560
Very lukewarm. It had
actually been deleted,

351
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,640
and then she stopped
doing reviews for months.
- Uh-huh. Why?

352
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,320
- Holidays? Alien abduction?
It doesn't say.

353
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,760
- Well, use all your
skills and find out.

354
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,720
What about Zachary's phone?
- Text coming to you.

355
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,440
Here's the one sacking Milo at 1am.

356
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
(CELL PHONE PINGS)

357
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
- (CHUCKLES) Harsh.

358
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,040
- I was shocked, especially
by text. Not Zachary's style.

359
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,040
- You must have felt betrayed.
- Ach, they're both crazy.

360
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,720
Zach tried to apologise that
morning ― take back the sacking ―

361
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I told him, 'Stuff it.' Yeah.

362
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,840
And then Steph offered me a job.

363
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,520
- Are those straight out of the oven?

364
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,560
- Portuguese tarts, yeah.
Made with puff pastry and cinnamon.

365
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,040
- Mm.

366
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't you just wanna get
away from both of them?

367
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
- Oh, they're hard
to be around, true,

368
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,520
but they were a great team.

369
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,400
All that competition made
them perfectimo. (CHUCKLES)

370
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,440
- Well, they're still
at one another's throats.
- True, true.

371
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,560
But Steph is easier to work with,

372
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,880
especially with Josh not around.

373
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,520
Sorry to say, but Josh
could be a bit, um,

374
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
bub-bub-bub, unhinged.
(DING-DONG!)

375
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,000
He came down, threatened
me at Zach's one day.

376
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,040
- Physically threatened you?
- Yeah. He said I should
quit. (SCOFFS)

377
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,840
He got stroppy; I tried to push
him out. Oh! He smacked me one.

378
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,080
And then Steph turned
up and dragged him away.

379
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,640
- Fancy.

380
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
(FUNK MUSIC)

381
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,640
I think Josh had anger
management problems.

382
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,040
He attacked Milo in Zachary's
bakery a while back.

383
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
- So maybe Milo pushed
him into the lake.

384
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,640
- He gets sacked, and then
he goes and murders Josh? Meh.

385
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,720
I want you and Beth to dig
a little deeper into Josh's past.

386
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,200
You know, find out if it was...

387
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
spicy and sweet,

388
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,920
savoury or stale.
- Already on it. Hey,

389
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,880
I might have some more information
about that Briar Lee review soonish.

390
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,440
- Oh my God.

391
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,560
Your digital sleuthing
powers are legendary.

392
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,640
- So,... you hated
Steph Rozentals' shop.

393
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,000
- Uh, hell no.
My audience doesn't want hate.

394
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,600
They wanna o hear what's
good, what's trending hot.

395
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,160
- Well, you weren't very
positive about Steph's.

396
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
- She is iconic,

397
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,240
but the cafe side of her
business lets her down.

398
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,120
- I noticed that you stopped
doing reviews for a few months,

399
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
just after the Rozentals post.

400
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,680
Comments deleted ― see you later.

401
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,800
- I'm back now.
Good bread is my life.

402
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,080
- But did something happen?

403
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,160
- After I posted that
Rozentals review,

404
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
there was an attack on my pages ―

405
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,160
spambots posting hundreds of links

406
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,040
to porn sites and incel chatrooms.

407
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,480
I couldn't do anything
but shut it down.

408
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,360
- Do you know who did it?
- It's very hard to
trace these things,

409
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,120
and it was devastating because
it's my livelihood, you know?

410
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,800
But I'm back now. So far, so good.

411
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,640
- You're not supposed to do the
interviews. I am the seasoned
detective.

412
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,440
(THUMP!)
- And I'm the trained
digital intelligence analyst.

413
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,800
Also, it was Briar Lee who
you called a Gen Z muppet.

414
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,240
- I have interviewed
plenty of muppets.

415
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,720
- Not ones who marked your
sourdough as seventh best.

416
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,360
You weren't to be trusted.
You know I'm right, eh, Chowder?

417
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,120
- (MIAOWS)
- So, tell me about these spambots.

418
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,560
- They came from a site in Croatia.

419
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,640
- Oh yeah? They hate Briar Lee too.

420
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,240
- Someone gave them money
to mount the attack.
- Is it possible to find out who?

421
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,040
- Yes, the spambots were paid
for through a PayPal account,

422
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,160
registered to―
- WHISPERS: Josh Boyer.
- Will you stop doing that?

423
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,160
- I can't. I'm a seasoned detective.

424
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
(FUNK MUSIC)

425
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,880
- Briar Lee. A little surprised
to see you here, actually,

426
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
after that review.

427
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,920
Seems like you don't much
care for the bread here.

428
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,600
- You supply Reuben's sourdough.
That's amazing.

429
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,000
- Seventh best is amazing (!)

430
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,880
Anyhoo, you spoke yesterday
to my colleague, Madison,

431
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
about that review you
did for Rozentals bakery.

432
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
- Briefly.

433
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,720
- You stopped posting
after the spam attack,

434
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
and then you started up
again a few weeks ago.

435
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
- Yes.

436
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
- Just after Josh Boyer died.

437
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,240
You knew Josh Boyer attacked you,
so you knew it was safe to start
posting again.

438
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,240
- I just said the coffee was awful.
It wasn't even about the baked
stuff.

439
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
- Did he find you?

440
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,240
- He came to my apartment.
He screamed at me through the door.

441
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,600
Then the spam happened,
and it was so ugly.

442
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,480
I was freaking out. Major anxiety.

443
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,840
I went to see Steph Rozentals, and―
- Steph was involved?

444
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,320
- Uh, I don't know. I just
asked her to call him off.

445
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,400
- What did she say?
- Pretty much zero.

446
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Not a word.

447
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,800
- Why didn't you tell
Madison this yesterday?

448
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,040
- She said the cops were
checking into Josh's death.

449
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,800
- And you didn't wanna
seem like a suspect?
- No.

450
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,680
I didn't want to admit I
was happy Josh was dead.

451
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,200
- Morning, Zachary.
- Morning.

452
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,960
- Sorry about the smell. Ugh.

453
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,800
Sorry. Sorry.
- Disgusting. I will find it.

454
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
- Sorry about the smell.

455
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
- Oh, Zachary?

456
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,160
- Yeah, it never stops.
- Hmm.

457
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,880
You remember Briar Lee?
- Who?

458
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,560
- She gave you a bad review
about three months back. You
know, about the coffee.

459
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,880
- (SIGHS) I've been doing
this for more than a decade,

460
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,240
and the worst critic I've ever had
was the man that I was married to.

461
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,480
Still is. Why would I care what
a teenager thinks about my coffee?

462
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,000
- So you didn't send
Josh over to monster her?

463
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,200
- Oh, yeah. That was, um...

464
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,440
That was actually
really embarrassing.

465
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,400
I tried to get him to stop, but
he was just really protective,
you know?

466
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
- Eureka! (LAUGHS)

467
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,480
You stinky little shrimp.
- Is, uh,...

468
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,360
everything OK over here?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

469

Cos your stunts are
like a Seth Rogen movie.

470
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,960
- Ah, well, you get your recipes
off the Internet, Steph.

471
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,360
- You know your pastry chef uses
custard powder in your danishes?
Did you know that?

472
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,480
- Are you aware that Milo's using
home-brand jam in your jam fancies?

473
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,520
- Well, at least people
fancy our jam fancies.
- Well, can I ask a quick question?

474
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,040
- No.
- Uh, when did you
start doing prawns?

00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,840
- Oh.

- Call an ambulance.
- It never stops.

car to get back to town.

- There were two murderers.

Zachary and Milo?

to town, there's no way that Zachary

650
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,520

for the shop that morning.

day, same as usual.

653
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
- All right, well, now
that the work is done,

654
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,560
stop at that place
that Beth mentioned?

655
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,720
Look, she texted me the directions,
and I'm starting to get hangry here,

- Try that one.

- Oh, come on. How did you do that?
- Do what?

671

Rozentals Bakery I got that
one time.

672

- What did you do? Did you bully
them into making it for you,did ya?

673
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,600
- No, Zachary doesn't
make kumara bread.

674
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,960
He bought it from the
markets out south.

675
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,640
- Ooh, that's a bit naughty,
isn't it? Not that I'm complaining.

- So just for confirmation, you

677

definitely bought the bread
from Zachary Rozentals' bakery.

678
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,640
- Uh, yeah. Is this about bread,
or did someone murder someone?

679
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,680
- Both. You got it
from Zachary's, right?
- No.

680
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,880
- No?
- No. They both had it.

out.

- Hi, Steph.

Oh, you got Zach's message?
Actually, it's from me.

- And now she's just
as confused as I am.

- Three weeks ago, you came here,

700
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,760
and you found Josh waiting
for you with his speargun.

701
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
- No.

702
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,080
- He made you hand over your phone,
and he sent that text to Milo giving
him the sack,

703
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,880
and that kept Milo out of the way.
- Uh, no again.

704
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,360
We've already been through
all of this with Milo.

705
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,320
- Yes, but he texted Milo
in his style, not yours.

706
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,000
He didn't finish with a full stop.

707
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,680
But, now, you always use a full stop.

708
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,200
And I think you use letters
instead of digits,

709
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,880
which I applaud. However, Josh,

710
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,480
he came here to take care of you,

711
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
cos he thought you were a problem,

712
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,080
a problem for Steph's business
that he had to fix ―

713
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,200
I mean, taking care of Milo,
for daring to work for Zachary,

714
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,400
after he opened the rival shop,

715
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
just like he took care of Briar Lee,

716
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,400
for posting a bad review.

717
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,880
See, Josh had a history of using

718
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,760
violence to solve problems,
but you knew that.

719
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,120
He'd watched you two at each
other's throats for months.

720
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,320
He could not guess what
you meant to one another,

721
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,960
even after the divorce.

722
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
So when Steph came into the shop,

723
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,600
and she saw Josh had
left his phone and gone,

724
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,840
she could guess where he was heading.

725
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,920
- Um, where is this coming from?

726
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,600
- This is an absolute fairy tale.

727
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,720
- Yeah, a 'Grimm' one.
So, there he is.

728
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,600
He's got you bailed up at
the point of his speargun.

729
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,600
And at some point, you decide to run.

730
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,000
I mean, do me a favour, would ya?

731
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,520
- Oh, my God, you
could've killed him!
- What the hell are you doing?!

732
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,160
- I am sorry about the wall,
but that is a perfect match.

God, ballistics is
just gonna love it.

734
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,520
But now we've got a problem.
He needs a new weapon.

735
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,920
So he reaches for this paddle.

736
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Well, not this paddle, cos he got rid
of that one. This one isshinyand
new.

737
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,560
You're duckin', you're divin',
and then Josh smacks you from behind,

738
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
on the back of the head.

739
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,640
What's he gonna do? Is he gonna beat
the hell out of you? Is he gonna
strangle you?

740
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,520
You don't know. But you fight back.

741
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,600
You get the upper hand,
and you knock Josh out cold.

742
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,280
SOFTLY: And then Steph shows up.

743
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
What was it like for you? I mean,

00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,320
I mean, up until that point,
it was self-defence, right?

748
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,520
You could have called the police,
but Zachary knew what to do.

749
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,960
He got a flour sack,
and he put it over Josh's head

750
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,240
and made you get in the van and
take the body down to the lake.

751
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,840
To drown him, to murder him.
- He was already dead. OK?

752
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,520
We were sure he was already dead.
- Would you shut up, you dick?

753
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,120
- And the road accident?
That was Steph's idea.

754
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,000
- You miserable prick.
- But the 'miserable prick'

755
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,160
did all the hard work
overpowering Josh,

756
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,200
right?
- I saved your life.
He was strangling you.

757

You were blue.
- So itwasyou.

758
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,120
You picked up the steel paddle,

759
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,640
and you took out Josh.

760
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,160
I mean, it was between Josh
and Zachary. You chose Zachary.

761
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,600
- She put the bag
on his head as well.
- Because you told me he was dead!

762
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,320
- Well, I'm not a medical expert,
am I? You said you wanted him to
be dead, Steph.

763
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,760
- No, I wanted him to go away.
But the lake was all your idea,
entirely your idea.

764
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,160
- No, no. Well, you made me
own that text to Milo. OK?

that I sacked him.

He thinks you're deranged.

- (STUTTERS) Portuguese tarts,
made with puff pastry and cinnamon,

been hitting new heights lately.

do to her? What did you say?

- I only care what you think, Reuben.

sourdough over Rozentals?
