1
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,616
I was starting to think
you'd gone to the other island.

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,776
I'm as adventurous as
the next person, Harry.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,096
But what is wrong with
a nice downtown cafe?

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,791
Have you done something
new with your hair?

5
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:27,816
No.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,100
Well, I like it.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,016
You're very chipper, considering.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,216
Considering my recent rise
to fame, the Delgado case?

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,576
Considering 6 o'clock news says
that you're derelict in your duty,

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,456
and the op-ed calls you
Defective Dimwit.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,340
- DetectiveDimwit.
- Oh.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,256
I dunno. I kinda like
the picture they used.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,733
All right.
What you got for me, Detective?

14
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:48,936
How much do you know?

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,056
Just what's been released, and that
they're shredding you in the press.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,160
Hey, I'm a public servant.
It's nice to get some public feedback.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,500
Beatriz Delgado, 28 years old.

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,976
Found stabbed to death
on an Auckland street.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,536
She was here on a working
holiday from Argentina,

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,900
teaching tango classes
at an Auckland dance studio.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,096
Prime suspect is Gavin Hartley,
one of Beatriz's tango students.

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,456
On the night of her death, Gavin invited
everyone to a party at his place.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,216
Nobody showed up except Beatriz.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,460
Her body was found
right outside Gavin's house.

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,656
Oh. So a spurned would-be hook-up?

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,571
They way they're
spinning this in the news

27
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:32,176
is that he killed her when
she turned him down.

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,736
- Which you don't believe.
- Cos it doesn't make sense.

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,383
Even if it was a crime of passion,

30
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:38,776
why would he leave the
body on the street all night?

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,456
To fake a mugging.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,580
Except she didn't have
any cash or cards stolen.

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,425
Was still wearing her jewellery.
She even had her phone.

34
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:47,376
Hm.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,216
No sign of other injuries, apart from
a healing fracture on her right toe.

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,496
Is it true there was CCTV
of Gavin leaving the house?

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,820
For a few minutes
around the stabbing, yes.

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,180
Which looks bad when isolated,
but without a weapon?

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,256
- OK, so what about DNA?
- They just came from the studio.

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,336
Beatriz had about 10 people's
DNA on her,

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,496
including Gavin's, the other
classmates', the instructors'.

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,936
All right, so she
wasn't waiting for a car,

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,234
because otherwise it wouldn't have taken
till the next morning

44
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:16,496
to find her body.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,736
So what was she doing on the street?
Did she make some calls?

46
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,296
She called her dad in
Buenos Aires. He didn't answer.

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,616
So what about the knife?

48
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,980
Five inches, single sided,
the type you'd find in any kitchen.

49
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,576
Though we did find camellia oil
residue in the wound.

50
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,936
People use that to maintain blades.

51
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
That's samurai shiz.

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,896
So, how much pressure
are you really under?

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,471
Well, I'm not about to make an arrest

54
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:40,580
just because people
are calling me names.

55
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,480
I love that about you.

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,339

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,137
No father should
have to bury his daughter.

58
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,176
I'm calling on the Auckland police

59
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,480
and Detective Harry Henare

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,616
to act in the murder of my daughter

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,384
and to bring her killer to justice.

62
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,256
Not only was Beatriz Delgado
a professional-level tango dancer,

63
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,416
with a master's in human rights law,

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,736
she volunteered at the
shelter and the soup kitchen.

65
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,616
Well, she was amazing.

66
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,140
Can I take a look?

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,816
So, Beatriz went straight from the
dance studio to Gavin's party,

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,857
but all of these people
decided unanimously

69
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:34,616
not to go to a party
they were invited to.

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,416
Yeah, on a Tuesday night. Come on,
who has parties on Tuesday nights?

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,520
Or maybe someone did go.

72
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,840
Someone we didn't know was there.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,100
Say hello to your
older brother for me, eh?

74
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,656
Whoa. Is it my birthday, is it?

75
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,176
- I gotta be honest, Reuben.
- This is a bribe.

76
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,780
Well, fire away.

77
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,096
I need someone who knows
how to talk to women.

78
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,456
Get some intel, tell me
what they're really thinking.

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,908
And I would give you some pointers,

80
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:09,816
but it looks like you know
what you're doing already.

81
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,557
Hey, well, you know what they say about

82
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:13,860
bartenders, barbers and baristas.

83
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,256
People love telling us their problems.

84
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,856
Exactly!

85
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,496
I can't believe that
you're picking Reuben over me.

86
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,616
I'm not picking him over you.

87
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,296
It's just,

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,493
people trust Rueben.

89
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:27,416
Yeah, well, people trust me.

90
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,536
By people, I mean bored
women who like his muscles.

91
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,296
Mm. The way you like his muscles.

92
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,400
See? You do understand.

93
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,700
Besides, I'm taking a dance partner,
Madison, not a bestie.

94
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,736
How do I look?

95
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,576
- I hate you.
- Good.

96
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,020
You look great.

97
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,427
We're planning a small November
ceremony,

98
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:54,736
and the tango thing's your idea.

99
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,136
Wait, why was it my idea?

100
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,376
Because you're a closet romantic,
Mr Crowe.

101
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,256
Oh, so we're taking
your last name, are we?

102
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,096
Yeah. Why not?

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,776
- Just try to act like a couple.
- OK.

104
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,880
Hi, hi. Are you guys new?

105
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,816
Uh, yes. I'm Alexa, and
this is my fiance, Reuben.

106
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,896
- Aw. Hilary.
- So nice to meet you both.

107
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,256
And no need to be nervous. We're
like one big, happy whanau here.

108
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,878
And Cesar is very good with beginners.

109
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,636
He's the best instructor in Australasia,

110
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,896
after his mother, of course.

111
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,696
- And you work here?
- No, I'm a student,

112
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,064
but I have been coming a long time.

113
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:30,776
Actually, the longest out of anyone,
I think.

114
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,900
- I thought this place just opened.
- Oh, it was a reopening.

115
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,296
Oh. Cos of renovations or something?

116
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,736
Something.

117
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,079
Uh, anyway, I will let
you two get settled in.

118
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,496
You know that I have
two left feet, right?

119
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,320
- How hard can it be? Just copy Cesar.
- Uh-huh.

120
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,280
- See? Easy.
- Yeah, right.

121
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,280
- Oh, isn't he amazing?
- He really knows his giro.

122
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,416
My mother, the incomparable Eva Borges!

123
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:48,109
Now, people always say to me,

124
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,736
'Cesar, tango. tango is not
dancing. Tango is sex standing up.'

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,416
He said that's his mother, right?

126
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,256
To them, I say, sex standing
up is sex standing up.

127
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,296
You should try sometime.

128
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,013
If I said that to my customers,
they'd report me.

129
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:06,056
Quite right, too.

130
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,336
A vertical expression
of horizontal desire.

131
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,576
Tango. tango is not about sex.

132
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,256
No, tango...

133
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,536
tango is about passion.

134
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,380
Tango, when it was
danced by the compadrones

135
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,280
on the streets of Buenos Aires,

136
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,480
was a knife fight between two men.

137
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,180
So...

138
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
let's fight!

139
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,136
Uh-uh.

140
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
- Miss Hilary.
- Oh.

141
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,620
Please.

142
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,420
Reg.

143
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,976
Take care of our new friend.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,080
- How are you?
- Hello. Hi.

145
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,536
Hm.
I was expecting to show off a little.

146
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,816
- You're not letting me.
- Well, I could stand on your foot.

147
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,813
Ooh. I might like that.

148
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,020
- Your wife?
- Yeah.

149
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,896
And your husband?

150
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,500
Fiance.

151
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,480
You guys all seem very tight.

152
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:16,149
- You hang out after class?
- Yeah, sorta here and there.

153
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,576
Any after parties I can horn in on?

154
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,216
- Oh God.
- What?

155
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,496
You're not one of those
true crime freaks, are you?

156
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,540
What? Please.

157
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:27,896
Huh? Digging around about Beatriz?
I bet you've got a podcast.

158
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,936
- Well, if I did, would you come on it?
- A wee word of advice.

159
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,496
Don't let Cesar hear what you're up to.

160
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,780
Change!

161
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,616
Did Reg take care of you?

162
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,616
Oh, yes. Thank you.

163
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,656
Does every newcomer get that
kind of coddling, or am I special?

164
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,856
- Definitely special.
- You use those lines on the men?

165
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,036
Men come here to make their girlfriends
happy,

166
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,856
or to meet their next girlfriend.

167
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,656
It is a delicate ecosystem,
like the Garden of Eden.

168
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,498
So that makes you God.

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,420
Nice.

170
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,620
Hilary?

171
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,516
I just wanted to say thank you so much
for welcoming us.

172
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,524
That was really nice.

173
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:16,456
Oh, I'm happy to.

174
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,557
Cos I was a little bit nervous, on
account of what happened to that girl,

175
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:21,176
you know, Beatriz.

176
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,176
Did you know that the
suspect was also a student?

177
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,816
He could have been obsessed
with anyone in that class.

178
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,616
Honestly, it could have been you.

179
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,551
Look, I'm not being mean here,

180
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:33,856
but Beatriz was a bit of a flirt,
you know?

181
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,216
I mean, I loved her.
She was a great girl.

182
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,856
But Gavin so clearly had issues.

183
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,940
I mean, he didn't even dance.

184
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,656
He just stayed
on the sidelines taking creepy photos.

185
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,496
I mean, why give him the time of day?

186
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,296
Hey, look, I hope I'm not,
like, stepping out of line here.

187
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,576
No, no. What?

188
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,724
But you and Ruben,
you seem really happy together.

189
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:50,900
Oh. Yeah, we are. Thank you.

190
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,096
Cesar likes to play games,
and they don't always end well.

191
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,320
So... just watch yourself around him.

192
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:00,771
OK.

193
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:02,536
All right. I've said too much.

194
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,840
Have a good night. Let's go.

195
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,096
What was that all about?

196
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,406
That was a large slice of victim blaming

197
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,720
with a dollop of 'don't take my man'.

198
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,282
<i>Cesar Borges left
Argentina when he was 2,</i>

199
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:24,336
<i>with his mother.</i>

200
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,668
Grew up in Melbourne,

201
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,576
moved to New Zealand
10 years ago and opened the studio.

202
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,536
They hired Beatriz last year
to help out with the workload.

203
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,496
And where was he the night she died?

204
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,176
<i>Well, according to Cesar</i>, Gavin
never invited him to the party,

205
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,296
so he just went home with his mother.

206
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,376
To quote his exact words,

207
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,004
'If you were trying to
get a woman's attention,

208
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:44,456
would you really want me in the room?'

209
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,336
Ooh. OK, are we going in or not?

210
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,096
Thanks, Harry.

211
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,752
OK, but listen,

212
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,096
Gavin's been hounded
by the press for months on end, OK?

213
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,478
He's not gonna want to talk to anyone,

214
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:56,650
so we're gonna have to do
things a little bit differently.

215
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,820
We're gonna have to do
some very convincing acting.

216
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,540
Ow. Help. Somebody.

217
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,335
Help! Can anybody hear me?
I think I've sprained my ankle.

218
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,576
Oh, hi.

219
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
- Are you OK?
- Uh-uh.

220
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,800
Come with me.

221
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
Thank you.

222
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,696
Did you take these photos?

223
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,260
Just a hobby.

224
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,776
Here you go.

225
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,340
- Sorry. I'll get a tea towel.
- Oh, no, no, no. That.

226
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,576
I'm a designer on it.

227
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,096
You're a fan?

228
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,576
I'm a fanatic.

229
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,616
I'm number eight in the
entire Asia-Pacific.

230
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,336
It is the smoothest
interface that I've ever played.

231
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,776
Look, can I get an autograph?
My friend Beth is gonna freak.

232
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,656
Can you leave? Since you've
made such a remarkable recovery?

233
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,056
- Look, Gavin. I can...
- How do you know my name?

234
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,616
You're a reporter. You're a bloody...

235
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,440
This is unethical practice. Ahh!

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,200
I'm with her. Do you mind?

237
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,416
You know, if that camera
had been angled correctly,

238
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,703
you would have got the whole stabbing

239
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:06,776
instead of just you leaving the house.

240
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,376
I heard something.

241
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,136
A possum or a cat, so I looked outside.

242
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,136
Look, why are we doing this? It's over.
I'm just waiting to be arrested.

243
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,256
You're not even gonna try
to clear your name?

244
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,260
I know a lost fight when I see one.

245
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,260
Fescue.

246
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,656
Double dwarf fescue.

247
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,696
This is notoriously slow-growing
and hates foot traffic.

248
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,776
Now, a possum is not heavy enough
to damage the node growth,

249
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,300
but a human being grinding it
under them for a prolonged period...

250
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,176
That'd never hold up in court.

251
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,136
No. It won't.

252
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,536
But I like to think that I have
good instincts about these things.

253
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,628
And Gavin,

254
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:45,028
I believe that somebody was waiting out
in that garden

255
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:46,980
for Beatriz that night.

256
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,740
Is there anybody we should be
looking at in that tango class?

257
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,500
Hilary.

258
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,896
She was queen of the studio
before Beatriz came along.

259
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,576
And the whole thing with
Cesar doesn't help.

260
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,856
What whole thing with Cesar?

261
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,934
Well, everyone thought there was
something going on

262
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,216
between Hilary and Cesar.

263
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,520
Then Beatriz comes along, and, well...

264
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,696
Hilary pulled a Tonya Harding on
Beatriz in front of everyone in class.

265
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,900
Stomped on her foot, broke her toe.

266
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,576
Did you tell the police that?

267
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,181
I was a little preoccupied
by the eight-hour interrogation.

268
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:19,131
Did you get the stomp on tape?

269
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,256
- You ready?
- Hey, can you hear this?

270
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:26,584
Just close it.

271
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:29,660
No, it's in my head now,
kind of like tinnitus.

272
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,740
You can't take the bathroom door off.

273
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,740
Why not?

274
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,176
- Privacy.
- Privacy? What's that?

275
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,880
Anyway, come, come take a look.

276
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,016
This is one of Gavin's dance videos.

277
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,856
Change!

278
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,100
I didn't know she was there.

279
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,456
Look, I know what Gavin said,
but could it have been an accident?

280
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,576
Nah, we just did that spin
in class. Hilary was flawless.

281
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,136
Well, with all the money she
spends there, I would hope so.

282
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,216
It's close to a grand a month
just on private lessons.

283
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,336
And her next one's happening...
this evening.

284
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,640
Oh. Book me in right after.

285
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,336
OK.

286
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,176
- Hour's up.
- Ooh.

287
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,100
Nope, according to me,
we still have two more minutes.

288
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:11,162
Gosh, I hope you didn't
just lose a client.

289
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,043
Where is your fiance?

290
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,576
He's working.

291
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,576
I'm a lucky man, then.

292
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,176
Getting paid to dance with you.

293
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,464
I'm sure you are.

294
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,509
No music?

295
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,020
I like to get a feel
for each other first.

296
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:27,547
OK.

297
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
One, two,

298
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,976
three, four,

299
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,696
five, six,

300
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
seven, eight.

301
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,816
So, what was that?

302
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Hilary seemed upset.

303
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
We had a disagreement.

304
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,974
Oh, she was trying to start something up
again,

305
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:49,816
and you're not interested any more?

306
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,256
There is a shelf life for everything.

307
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,308
Pass the point and you are
just delaying the inevitable.

308
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,860
- Oh.
- Spin.

309
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,776
Ho-ho-ho!

310
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Very good.

311
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,536
And I guess gentlemen don't tell.

312
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,840
Who said I was a gentleman?

313
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:09,300
Ocho.

314
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
What about Beatriz?

315
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,920
Then again, maybe I am.

316
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,616
You know, normally I
like arabica, but this?

317
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,061
This has got some sorta chocolatey,
umami flavours,

318
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,096
you know, meaty, beaty,
big and bouncy, Argentinian.

319
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,180
You like Argentinian, don't you?

320
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,310
I'm just trying to look out for you,

321
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:41,096
make sure that you don't
make the same mistake that I did.

322
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
What mistake is that?

323
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,220
Being tricked into
thinking that he cares.

324
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,056
Look, Reuben seems
like a really great guy.

325
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,496
So for the sake of your relationship,
I would stick to group classes.

326
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,000
Or better yet,
find another dance school.

327
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,996
So, according to Hilary's alibi,

328
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,856
she went
straight home after the tango class.

329
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,376
10.30 or 11. and she
stayed there all night.

330
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,376
And three, two...

331
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,416
And Gavin says that Beatriz
left his place about 11.30pm.

332
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,496
So the police have dated the murder
to no later than midnight.

333
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Oh, there!

334
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,696
10.49. And then her phone's GPS
places her at her apartment all night.

335
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,576
You know, it is possible to
leave your house without a phone.

336
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,256
I used to do it all the time.

337
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,856
OK, so you think that she left
her apartment without being seen,

338
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,896
went to Gavin's party
without being seen,

339
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,976
and then killed Beatriz
without being seen?

340
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,208
Well, let's find out.

341
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,456
Oh, hi. Come here often?

342
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,296
Well, let's be honest. Your
mother's had it in for me since day one.

343
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,736
Oh, sorry.

344
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,355
Yeah?

345
00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:00,056
OK. Well,
we'll talk about it later, all right?

346
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Love you. OK.

347
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:05,119
First floor, apartment 115.

348
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,990
Nice work, by the way.
I love the bit about my mother.

349
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:17,126
Well, hello again.

350
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,056
I can't see many places
to hide from those cameras.

351
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,540
OK, gimme a sec.

352
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Blind spot!

353
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,460
Are there any exits around?

354
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,936
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's a stairway.

355
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,536
Back up. I can see you there.

356
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,056
Stairway.

357
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,456
Are you seeing me now?

358
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,004
What the hell are you doing here?

359
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:46,656
You can stalk me, but I can't stalk you?
Hang on, Mads.

360
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,056
- You're stalking me?
- Well, a little bit.

361
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,496
Hey, why did you break Beatriz's toe?

362
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,783
You know, when you did that spin out
of sequence

363
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,096
when changing partners?

364
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,256
Two weeks before Beatriz's death.

365
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,256
Well, it wasn't actually like that.

366
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,856
That's why Cesar called it off.

367
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,536
Cos you're violent.

368
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,176
Says the woman creeping
outside my apartment.

369
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,256
- Don't be silly.
- Not the same thing at all.

370
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,496
So, yesterday you followed me.

371
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,536
You assaulted Beatriz,
and now I find out that

372
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,336
you can get out of your
apartment without being seen.

373
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,496
That's an awful lot to leave
out of your official alibi.

374
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,260
Who are you?

375
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,256
Good Lord.

376
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,416
What is it with this guy Cesar?
He's like human catnip.

377
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,616
Oh, he doesn't do it for you?

378
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,456
Please, Madison.

379
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,776
There is more to life than tango,
horizontal or otherwise.

380
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
- Whatcha doin'?
- Ooh.

381
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,403
The night Beatriz was murdered,

382
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:41,616
Hilary
placed an Uber Eats order at 11.20pm.

383
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,056
Two mains, two drinks.
So either she was hungry...

384
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,480
...or she was with someone.

385
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Look familiar?

386
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,936
Two options, Reg.

387
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,469
Either you graciously
allow me to blackmail

388
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:07,620
you with this evidence of your affair...

389
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,656
I've got no idea what
you're talking about.

390
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,856
...or I invite myself in for
dinner with you and the missus.

391
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,880
CCTV images are so clear nowadays.

392
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,816
OK. So, according to Romeo, Hilary
ordered food after their activities,

393
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,056
and she was in the apartment all night.

394
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,176
So no midnight sneak-out to do murder?

395
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,056
No. I mean, I guess it makes sense.

396
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,988
If sleeping with a married
man was my only alibi,

397
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:34,736
then I might not cop to it either.

398
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,096
Oh, you've never slept
with a married man?

399
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,900
You mean apart from
the one who was married to me?

400
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,776
Look, Gavin. I said that
I'm gonna help you, and I am.

401
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,696
Well, you can help by having your
detective friend arrest Hilary.

402
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,416
Hilary has an alibi, and you don't.

403
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,536
When we give the police a name,
we want them to take us seriously.

404
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,760
Cesar, then! He's, um...

405
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,616
H-H-He got jealous because
Beatriz came to my house.

406
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,700
Gavin, I want you to relax,
have a think and be reasonable.

407
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,856
Ta-da!

408
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,580
- Sorry. You can't come.
- But... my dress, my heels.

409
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Check on Gavin. He sounds erratic.

410
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,376
I didn't dress like this for Gavin.

411
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,480
- Hi, Reuben. How are you?
- Hi.

412
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,980
- This won't take long.
- Do what you do.

413
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,860
Evening.

414
00:22:37,513 --> 00:22:40,534
Reg said that he was harassed
while taking out the recycling.

415
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,420
Well, that's terrible.

416
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:46,620
I'm gonna ask you this
one more time. Who are you?

417
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,336
I think you really were
trying to warn me.

418
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,748
And I think that

419
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:54,180
you really believe everything
you're saying when you say it.

420
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,940
A bit like him.

421
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,460
Come on, Gavin. Pick up. Pick up.

422
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Where are you?

423
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,220
Crap.

424
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,260
Can I get you a drink?

425
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,300
Malbec.

426
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,576
Gosh, that's beautiful.

427
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,700
Thank you. It was my mother's.

428
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,980
May I?

429
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,976
Oh.

430
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,300
- Is that Cesar?
- Yes. He was very fat.

431
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,376
Gosh, it's quite amazing.

432
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,241
You came here with absolutely nothing,

433
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:45,256
and look at everything you've built.

434
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,020
It mustn't have been easy.

435
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,536
Australia and New Zealand.
a lot easier than where I come from.

436
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,376
Ladies and gentlemen? Partners, please.

437
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,540
I need to tell you something.

438
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Change.

439
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Ow! God!

440
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,920
Remember the first class?

441
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,720
I said tango is a dance of combat.

442
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,896
Adversity.

443
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Passion, yes.

444
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,740
But also anger, which some people
might argue is the same thing.

445
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,860
It is good to get your
blood a little hot...

446
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,816
Officer Crowe.

447
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,816
That's Detective Retired, actually.

448
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,656
Outta my way!

449
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,180
Move.

450
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,387
- Gavin. It is good to see you...
- Oh, shut the hell up!

451
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:49,456
Oh my God.

452
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,376
What are you doing here?

453
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,336
- You said you were gonna help me!
- Gavin, go home. Now.

454
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,056
All of you people. You all
hated me from the beginning.

455
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
And you?

456
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
You're a murderer!

457
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,980
Oh, Gavin.

458
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,256
You should leave.

459
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
You and your friend.

460
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:18,593
Gavin, out.

461
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,440
Congratulations. You made the rag.

462
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,315
This is defamation.

463
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:36,656
Well, not if they don't use your name.
and they haven't.

464
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,838
It's New Zealand.
There are no secrets. We have to...

465
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:40,136
We don't have to do anything.

466
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,155
In fact, I'm gonna go talk
to my friend the detective

467
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:43,616
and get him not to arrest you.

468
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,576
You didn't think that through, did ya?

469
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,176
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Madison?

470
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,016
This is for your own good.

471
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,700
Are you serious?

472
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,536
Are you OK there?

473
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,296
Yeah. It's just a bit squeaky.

474
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,776
- You should put some oil on the hinges.
- And a handyman too.

475
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,896
You're welcome.
So, Hilary's out of the picture?

476
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,816
Yep. She was with Reg
all night long. Solid alibi.

477
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,496
I thought she was with Cesar.

478
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,256
That's over. She was only with
Reg to try to make Cesar jealous.

479
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,256
- It didn't work.
- Huh.

480
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,096
You look confused. You want a map?

481
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,060
It's funny how all roads
lead back to Cesar.

482
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:30,249
Whatever he had with Beatriz,
this thing with Hilary...

483
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:32,526
If enough of the webs
start shaking on the outside,

484
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,050
you start looking at the centre.

485
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,625
You ever seriously look at him?

486
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:37,776
No,
Gavin sucked up all the air in the room.

487
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,736
Besides, no motive, no weapon.
Not to mention his alibi.

488
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,140
Well, his mother's his alibi.

489
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,865
And mothers will do a lot
of things for their sons, right?

490
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Hello.

491
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,080
- Speak of the devil.
- _

492
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,940
- You're not going, are you?
- Absolutely not.

493
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,180
You know, I'm still waiting.

494
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,136
Waiting for what?

495
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,740
An apology for ruining last night.

496
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,936
Oh.

497
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,579
Wait. You made all of this?

498
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,044
When we lived in Australia,

499
00:27:19,068 --> 00:27:23,376
my mother had no one to teach
her recipes to except me, so...

500
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,980
- Well, why did you come down here?
- Why not America or Europe?

501
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,700
She wanted to get as
far away as possible.

502
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,360
- It sounds like she had a hard life.
- It is easier now. She has me.

503
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:40,180
Did you cook like this for Beatriz?

504
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
She liked my humitas.

505
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,896
How's it going?

506
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,831
Oh, it's going.

507
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,096
What the hell is that?

508
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,296
Sounds like you've got
a fight club going there.

509
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,216
Well, then I better not talk about it.

510
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,656
- And you? Still alive?
- Yeah, still alive.

511
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,936
But I've gotta go. He's cooking steak.

512
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,576
Ooh, I love a man who can cook.

513
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,616
Unless he's a murderer, of course.

514
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,616
- Heh-heh!
- I'm done.

515
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,200
Oh, don't be a sore loser.

516
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Hey, Madison? Thanks.

517
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,136
For literally beating
you at your own game?

518
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,340
For talking to me like I'm a person.

519
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,136
Beatriz was the same.

520
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,020
She knew I liked her, but she never
made me feel like a freak about it.

521
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,016
Put your back into it this time.

522
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,460
Actually, can I use the bathroom?

523
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,580
You don't have to trust me, but...
do you really think I'm stupid?

524
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,400
- Deer antler.
- Argentinian speciality.

525
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,456
I didn't know you were home.

526
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,096
I'm heading out. Evening class.

527
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,376
Oh, that shouldn't be there.

528
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,336
Cesar's first competition.

529
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,736
Before this, I was going to
push him for medical school.

530
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,840
Oh, cos you were a nurse.

531
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,576
A long time ago.

532
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,416
He would have been a terrible doctor.

533
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,245
The only blood he can stand

534
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:12,380
is whatever is coming out of that steak.

535
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,880
Go. He's waiting for you.

536
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,420
OK. Night.

537
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,460
I met him last year, and at
first I thought he wasn't my type,

538
00:29:32,484 --> 00:29:34,896
but turns out he was just misunderstood.

539
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Like you, I suppose.

540
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,060
What is taking so long?

541
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,656
It's hard to go when
someone's listening outside the door.

542
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,563
I'm not listening. I'm telling you my
life story

543
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:46,256
to drown out the sound effects.

544
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Wait, you wouldn't.

545
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,020
The oldest trick in the book.
Gavin, I trusted you.

546
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,800
My mother likes you, you know.

547
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,880
- Is that a prerequisite?
- Always.

548
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,416
A mama's boy, huh?

549
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,869
So, what does she do?
Hole up in her bedroom with earplugs

550
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:10,496
when you're entertaining
Beatriz and Hilary?

551
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,860
- No, Hilary's never been here.
- Beatriz, a few times.

552
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,148
She was a stranger in a strange land.

553
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:18,696
She
needed someone who spoke her language.

554
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,820
When was the last time she was here?

555
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,420
- Uh... the night.
- The night that it happened.

556
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:30,340
She wanted to borrow a book from
the library, and then we had dinner.

557
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,120
- And after that?
- We went to the studio.

558
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,376
She had already turned me down.

559
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,820
We were just friends. That is all.

560
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,720
Look, I appreciate your faith in my
powers of seduction,

561
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,460
but it does happen.

562
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,776
People decide whether they're going
to sleep with you in three seconds.

563
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Love. Love is hard.

564
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,296
Attraction? Serotonin.

565
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,816
Oh, I see.

566
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,736
That's the play, dinner and
pseudoscience at Casa Borges.

567
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,136
You tell me.

568
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,246
Should I take it from
your surprise about

569
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:10,060
Beatriz rejecting me to
mean you wouldn't have?

570
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:11,780
Oh, come on.

571
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,576
I'm hardly competing with
the likes of Hilary and Beatriz.

572
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,900
Ah.

573
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
I prefer older women.

574
00:31:23,193 --> 00:31:25,273
Argentinian olive oil?

575
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,176
Tea seed oil.

576
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,656
Its high smoking point
is good for searing.

577
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,760
Three minutes each side.

578
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,216
There is lots of things
you can do in six minutes.

579
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,351
Six minutes isn't as
impressive as you think.

580
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,652
You know, I really like you.

581
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,020
Give me a sec?

582
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,336
Harry?

583
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,536
Hey, it's not a good time.

584
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,420
- You're not home?
- No, I'm at dinner.

585
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,540
Gavin's been arrested.

586
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,180
Police are pressing charges tonight.

587
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,247
They caught Gavin at the airport

588
00:31:57,271 --> 00:31:59,016
trying to board a flight to Montenegro,

589
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,456
which doesn't have an
extradition treaty with us.

590
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,770
So the judge is refusing
to let him out on bail,

591
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:05,940
because he's an active flight risk.

592
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,260
He jammed the bathroom door closed.

593
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,100
Look, what about Cesar?
Did you find anything?

594
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,536
Does this mean that you're gonna
put the door back on the hinges?

595
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,656
Tea seed oil.
It's what Cesar uses to cook with.

596
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,376
Aka camellia oil.

597
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,816
The oil they found
in Beatriz's stab wound.

598
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,056
Do you know how many
people use camellia oil?

599
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,781
No, I don't, Harry. How many?

600
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:29,256
- That was rhetorical.
- Oh.

601
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,216
Enough for it to be circumstantial
at best, without an actual weapon.

602
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,616
Or a motive.

603
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,536
Well, he did say that
Beatriz had turned him down.

604
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,160
Spurned lovers. It's a start.

605
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:45,180
- You don't think so?
- A week ago, maybe.

606
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,176
It's just terrible business practice, at
the end of the day,

607
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,220
- so we're gonna have to...
- Reggie.

608
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:58,260
I'll catch up.

609
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,896
This is harassment.
I could have you arrested.

610
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,763
No, then you'd have to do
some explaining to your wife,

611
00:33:03,787 --> 00:33:05,336
and that'd get really hairy,
wouldn't it?

612
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,936
- I've got a lunch.
- This will be quick.

613
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,656
So, Beatriz was not
dancing the night she died.

614
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,048
What was she doing at that event?

615
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,940
- That was three months ago.
- Memory, rack it.

616
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,976
She was with that creep Gavin.

617
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,856
Then he got into his head to ask us
all over to his place. no thanks.

618
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,416
And then she spent the rest
of the night with Cesar's mum.

619
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,096
So Beatriz was close to Eva.

620
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,632
Well,
it helps to have the mother on side

621
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:30,296
when you're sleeping with the son.

622
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,536
Close isn't how I'd put it.
Not with Cesar or Eva.

623
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,045
God knows what Hilary saw in him.
He's...

624
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:38,416
- He's cold.
- Why do you say that?

625
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,377
Well,
the girl who works for you gets killed,

626
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:43,056
and you don't even shut up shop,
out of respect?

627
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,576
- But I thought they did.
- There was a reopening.

628
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,496
No, they only closed last month
because they got sick of the reporters.

629
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,416
Went down south, him and Eva.

630
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,201
I mean, he likes to pretend like he's

631
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:54,756
all torn up,
just so women'll feel sorry for him,

632
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,496
but the truth is that some
men just don't value women.

633
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,400
It's sick, really. It's misogyny.

634
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,740
Right.

635
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,936
Do you often do this. showing up
at women's houses uninvited?

636
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,258
Well, your address was
on the registry when you signed up,

637
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:20,336
and fortune favours the bold.

638
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,360
- But I'm engaged.
- Ah, yes. Reuben, the fiance.

639
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:28,095
This cover story business
is getting a little dull.

640
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,620
Did you meet the Delgados
when they were here?

641
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,101
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, no, that's right. You were in the South Island.

642
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,456
I forgot.

643
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,850
I just thought, you know,
strangers in a strange land.

644
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:41,180
You might have stayed to meet them.

645
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,100
Those need water.

646
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:52,389
- Hey.
- Oh, I was just about to come home.

647
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:53,790
Reuben! Coffee!

648
00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:56,471
And that's why I'm marrying her!

649
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:58,876
OK, what do we know about the Delgados?

650
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,427
Beatriz's parents.

651
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:04,136
Is there any reason
that Cesar would want to avoid them?

652
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,696
Apart from the fact that maybe
he killed their daughter, you mean?

653
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,656
Francisco Delgado.

654
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,736
I just saw Cesar, and when I
mentioned Beatriz's parents, he bolted.

655
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,616
Oh, hold on.

656
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,456
You know how Francisco
is a human rights lawyer?

657
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,376
Turns out he's not just any lawyer.

658
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,856
- Ooh, he famous.
- _

659
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,268
Specialises in chasing down human
rights violations

660
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:24,816
during the Dirty War.

661
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,736
This general's his 21st
successful prosecution.

662
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,340
- Dirty War?
- '76 to '83.

663
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,400
Phone, phone, phone, phone.

664
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,466
Why do you need so
many pictures of your bread?

665
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,656
Posterity.

666
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,696
Here. Check it.

667
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,976
What am I looking at?

668
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,816
Harry said they left
Argentina to escape the junta.

669
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,835
the same junta that Delgado is putting
in jail

670
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:46,940
one by one for war crimes.

671
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:51,123
Now, if you were Eva,
this guy would be your hero.

672
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,020
Why wouldn't you want to meet him?

673
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,540
Because you're not who you say you are.

674
00:35:56,672 --> 00:36:00,248
Beatriz was calling her
father when she was murdered.

675
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:02,700
I think it's time we found out why.

676
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:14,033
My footwork needs finessing.

677
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:39,100
Hand.

678
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,360
- I've reconsidered.
- Back step.

679
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
That second date.

680
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:02,629
I don't think that is a good idea.

681
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,190
Why not?

682
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:06,351
What's changed between
yesterday and today?

683
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:07,580
Turn.

684
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:11,186
It's unprofessional.

685
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,736
Because I'm your student?

686
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,136
Because you're sticking your
nose where it doesn't belong.

687
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Oh. Of course.

688
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,216
Was your mother always a tango dancer?

689
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,831
You should stop being so nosy
about other people's families

690
00:37:27,855 --> 00:37:29,540
and focus on your giro.

691
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,968
It's shoddy.

692
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:34,420
No one's ever said
that about my giro before.

693
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,616
So, shall we talk about
Beatriz's family, then?

694
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,252
A woman is dead. Let her rest.

695
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:44,100
How can she rest when
her killer is still out there?

696
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,360
What are you implying?

697
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:52,820
Have you heard of the Escuela
Superior de Mecanica de la Armada?

698
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,336
You can go, or I can call security.

699
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,456
Aka the Navy Petty-Officers
School of Mechanics,

700
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,136
aka a concentration camp
in central Buenos Aires

701
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,100
for political prisoners.

702
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,775
Get out.

703
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,620
There were only five
midwives at the ESMA.

704
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,140
Two of them are dead,

705
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:18,962
one of them's in custody,

706
00:38:18,987 --> 00:38:21,243
and two of them are wanted
by the Argentinian government

707
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:23,437
for aiding and abetting the kidnapping
of children

708
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:25,100
during the Dirty War.

709
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:29,513
And one of their names
was Lucrezia Sevellos.

710
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,336
Your real name.

711
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,540
- Get back to the office.
- I'll handle this.

712
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,776
It wasn't just any box in that study.

713
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,908
It was a hardwood and deer-antler box
custom made

714
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:42,296
to hold a gaucho knife.

715
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,120
Five inches, single sided blade.

716
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:48,780
One of only two things
you brought from Argentina.

717
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,689
What was it you said?

718
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:55,230
Your mother had had a hard life,

719
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:57,740
and
you wanted to make things easy for her.

720
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,900
You want to protect her from her past.

721
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,576
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

722
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,856
- Camellia oil.
- It was found on Beatriz's wounds.

723
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,020
That's the oil that your
mother uses to tend the knife.

724
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Did you kill her?

725
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,256
- Yes.
- No!

726
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
Yes. I killed her.

727
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,856
No, you didn't.

728
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,694
No, you come into our lives

729
00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:28,976
and you
dig up these things from 40 years ago.

730
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,216
- Things that don't even matter.
- Things that don't matter?

731
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,136
- Don't. Don't.
- Please, don't. Just...

732
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,256
Just arrest me. Just do it. Please.

733
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,877
This is the only other thing that your
mother brought from Argentina.

734
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:41,216
This picture.

735
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,740
And Beatriz saw it at your house
the night she came to dinner.

736
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,703
That photo is one of the
only surviving pictures

737
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:50,740
taken from inside the
ESMA when it was active.

738
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,336
That photo, as Francisco
Delgado told me last night,

739
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,100
has been sitting on his desk
since Beatriz was in law school.

740
00:39:59,686 --> 00:40:02,380
She recognised you, and you knew it.

741
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,535
So you got Gavin's
address from the registry,

742
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:09,540
and you went to Gavin's house,
where you knew she would be.

743
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:12,109
You saw her on her phone.

744
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,810
And when Beatriz left to go home,

745
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:17,036
you were the one that
Gavin heard in his yard.

746
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:18,500
And then...

747
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,140
She was calling her father. She
wanted to tell him what she'd seen.

748
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,620
He never picked up, but you knew
it was only a matter of time.

749
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:32,827
And ultimately,
the threat wasn't against your life

750
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:34,061
or the life you've built here,

751
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:37,508
but that the person you love most in all
the world

752
00:40:37,532 --> 00:40:40,262
would find out what you did

753
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:42,287
and what you are.

754
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:45,795
You have no baby photos.
You have no father.

755
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:50,060
Because Eva took you from a prisoner
at the camp where she worked.

756
00:40:52,073 --> 00:40:54,049
- She stole you.
- No.

757
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:56,050
I saved him.

758
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,256
That's not...

759
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,056
Come on, Mother, that is not true.

760
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,296
That's... That's not true.

761
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,493
J-Just listen to me.

762
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:09,016
No, no. Stop crying.
It is not true. She's lying.

763
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,240
I love you. You're my boy.

764
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:14,822
You're my son. I love you.
I've always loved you.

765
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,847
Te amo, hijo mio.

766
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:19,306
It'll be OK.

767
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,813
Te amo, hijo mio.

768
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,380
It wasn't personal, you know.

769
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:34,260
I know.

770
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:38,635
You know, at first, I hated you.

771
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,660
For what you did to her.

772
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,640
I wanted to hurt you,

773
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:47,595
like you hurt us.

774
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,220
And then today I saw him.
Beatriz's father.

775
00:41:51,866 --> 00:41:54,402
Have you ever seen a dead man walking?

776
00:41:54,427 --> 00:41:56,427
A few times.

777
00:42:00,206 --> 00:42:02,286
Eva is still your mother.

778
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,980
You can't erase the last 40 years.
You can't switch it on and off.

779
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,860
It's part of the burden of living.

780
00:42:11,873 --> 00:42:14,900
You could try to look for
your biological parents.

781
00:42:16,046 --> 00:42:17,540
Grandparents.

782
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,140
You don't have to do this alone.

783
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,666
It is a really nice day.

784
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
Yeah, it is.

785
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,416
- Numero quatre.
- Hey!

786
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,096
That's Spanish and French.

787
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,536
But we've got Spanish
tapas and French wine.

788
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,496
So they bullied you into it, huh?

789
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,718
No, we made an arrest. Gavin's in the
clear.

790
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,216
I get to tell my team, 'I told you so.'

791
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,183
What makes you think
I don't want to party?

792
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:01,376
Oh, just everything about you.

793
00:43:03,953 --> 00:43:05,929
Aw, Harry.

794
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,416
Oh, Harry.

795
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,738
Are you scared I'm gonna show you up?

796
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:13,380
Yeah, real scared!

797
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
- Oh! What?!
- Oh!

798
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,513
A man of many skills.

799
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,376
Oh, where the hell did you learn that?

800
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,857
Learn what?

801
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:27,011
- You've been holding out on me.
- Yeah?

802
00:43:27,035 --> 00:43:29,778
Yeah. You have.

803
00:43:29,803 --> 00:43:31,859
Who are you, Harry Henare?

804
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,096
Sebastian Kent.

805
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,976
He had some enemies.

806
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,136
Famous author dead inside a
statue. that's pretty juicy.

807
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,336
I told you it was macabre.

808
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,360
- Good morning, sunshine!
- Alexa, it is 3.23am.

809
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,456
- She's here to help.
- Help who?

810
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,096
- You?
- Everybody wants something.

811
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,736
I wasted a third of my life
in service to his career.

812
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,456
We're all a bit sick
of talking about it.

813
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,780
Righto.

814
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:04,060
I always say the best murder site
is one that no one knows is there.
