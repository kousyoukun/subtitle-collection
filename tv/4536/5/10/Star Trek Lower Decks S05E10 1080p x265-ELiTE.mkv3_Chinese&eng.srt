1
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:25,590
之前在《星际迷航：下层甲板》...
Previously on Star Trek: Lower Decks...

2
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:27,505
MARINER: 哥们，又一个量子裂缝？
MARINER: Man, another quantum fissure?

3
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:28,593
BOIMLER: 你看到了那个其他的博伊默。
BOIMLER: You saw that other Boimler.

4
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,508
好酷且成功。
So cool and successful.

5
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:33,381
如果我模仿他，也许我也可以很酷。
If I copy him, then maybe I can be cool, too.

6
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,904
RUTHERFORD: 我的植入物正在
RUTHERFORD: My implant is having

7
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,558
连接这个旧门时遇到困难。
a hard time connecting to this old door.

8
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,603
好吧，也许我终于该填补
Well, maybe it's finally time I fill

9
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:40,257
高级科学官的职位了。
the senior science officer position.

10
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:42,694
你认为T'Lyn在和我竞争吗？
You don't think T'Lyn's competing with me, do you?

11
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,609
MARINER: 我刚听说你失去了船长职位，
MARINER: I just heard you lost your captaincy,

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,176
我会帮你拿回来。
and I'm gonna help you get it back.

13
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:48,396
MA'AH: 巴赫，我选你去死。
MA'AH: Bargh, I select you to die.

14
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:50,006
哦，太棒了，兄弟。
Ho, that was awesome, brother.

15
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:51,573
我们一直假设这些维度裂缝
We've been assuming these dimensional rifts

16
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:52,965
是自然现象，但现在看起来
are a natural occurrence, but now it's looking

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,358
像是有人在制造它们。
like someone's making them.

18
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,273
你经历过复制吗？
You have experienced duplication?

19
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:57,753
我的意思是，如果他还在，我敢打赌他会
I mean, if he were still around, I bet he'd be

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,624
在某个巨大的冒险中。
in some huge adventure.

21
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:03,193
- 哈利，你必须停止。 - [咯咯笑]
- Harry, you have to stop. - [cackles]

22
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:06,762
斯洛恩：通过定向孤子爆发，我可以引导
SLOANE: With a directed soliton burst, I can guide

23
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,590
波浪进入一个单一的现实。
the wave into a single reality.

24
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:10,505
水手：整个宇宙不会被摧毁吗？
MARINER: Won't an entire universe be destroyed?

25
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:12,072
使用我的现实。
Use my reality.

26
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:14,726
我将消息转发给我的复制品。
I piggybacked a message to my duplicate.

27
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:16,337
- 他会知道该怎么做。 - 他会吗？
- He'll know what to do. - Will he?

28
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,556
威廉：是的，只要他不崩溃。
WILLIAM: Yeah, as long as he doesn't freak out.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,656
我们的扫描是负面的。
Our scans are negative.

30
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:33,571
该地区没有敌人。
There are no enemies in the area.

31
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:36,096
雷尔加：我可以看到。设定航向边界。
RELGA: I can see that. Set course for the border.

32
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,273
也许我们可以激怒星际舰队来打仗。
Maybe we can antagonize Starfleet into a fight.

33
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:42,232
但高级委员会认为他们是盟友。
But the High Council considers them to be allies.

34
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,104
[嘟] 委员会！
[bleep] the council!

35
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,410
我们只是在这个毫无价值的帝国角落巡逻，
We're only patrolling this worthless corner of the empire

36
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:48,108
因为我的兄弟们被谋杀
because my brothers were murdered

37
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:49,587
而委员会认为我软弱！
and the council thinks me weak!

38
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:51,937
我宁愿割掉他们所有的喉咙，也要有机会...
I would cut all their throats for a chance to...

39
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:55,027
舰长，传感器正在检测到泰克粒子的增加。
Captain, sensors are detecting an increase in tachyons.

40
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,900
泰克粒子对猛禽号毫无意义。
Tachyons mean nothing to a Bird-of-Prey.

41
00:01:57,987 --> 00:02:00,772
[笑声]
[laughter]

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,517
嗯？
Huh?

43
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:13,481
我正在读到大量的孤立子粒子累积。
I'm reading a massive buildup of soliton particles.

44
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:15,352
快把我们带离这里！
Get us out of here!

45
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,794
- [喊] - [尖叫]
- [shouts] - [screaming]

46
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:25,145
[用力]
[straining]

47
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,460
我们已经躲过孤立波，
We have evaded the soliton wave,

48
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,027
但克尔塔斯已经被摧毁。
but the Krtas has been destroyed.

49
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,943
- 我应该向指挥部报告吗？ - 不。
- Shall I report this to command? - No.

50
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:43,641
这正是我需要的。
This is exactly what I needed.

51
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:47,254
[笑]
[laughing]

52
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,935
赎金：第一官员的日志。
RANSOM: First officer's log.

53
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,328
在一个星际舰队-克林贡研究站完成修理后，
Having finished repairs at a joint

54
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,243
塞里托斯号正在享受一些待命时间。
Starfleet-Klingon research station,

55
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:07,203
内容：
the Cerritos is enjoying a little downtime.

56
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:09,858
啊。因为我们下午都放假，
Ah. Since we both have the afternoon off,

57
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:12,339
想在全息甲板上玩性感宝藏岛吗？
want to play Sexy Treasure Island on the holodeck?

58
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,341
只有在我可以成为长约翰[消音]的情况下。
Only if I get to be Long John [bleep].

59
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,081
- 天啊，我爱你。 - [轻声笑]
- God, I love you. - [laughs softly]

60
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:18,954
啊，成为准尉真是太好了。
Ah, being a lieutenant JG rules.

61
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,478
谁知道更高的军衔带来了更多的玩乐自由？
Who knew higher rank came with more freedom to goof around?

62
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,175
这真的很放松。
It's honestly very relaxing.

63
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,047
我第一次到来时你可不是这样的态度。
That was not your attitude when I first arrived.

64
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:27,179
你更混乱。
You were more chaotic.

65
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,051
真的吗？啊。可不想失去我的优势。
Really? Ah. Don't want to lose my edge.

66
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:31,140
- 享受那个牛油果，学员！ - [喊]
- Enjoy that avocado, cadet! - [shouts]

67
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,098
[轻笑] 还行。
[chuckles] Still got it.

68
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:34,361
你们在忙什么？
What are you guys so busy with?

69
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:35,710
高级科学官的事务。
Senior science officer stuff.

70
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,625
我在编目可波普尔水平
I am cataloging the corbopple levels

71
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,844
- 的等角法兰计。 - 而我在研究
- of the isometric flangometer. - And I'm researching

72
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,759
可波普尔排放如何影响睡眠。
how corbopple emissions affect sleep.

73
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,371
可-可波普尔-- 你在开玩笑。这不真实。
C-Corbopple-- you're messing with me. That's not real.

74
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,286
- 一半的波普尔都是被可波的。 - 它是
- Half of all bopples are corbed. - It is a foundational element

75
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,331
- 人工引力的基础元素。 - [grunt]
- of artificial gravity. - [grunts]

76
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,681
- [呻吟] - 拉瑟福德。
- [groans] - Rutherford.

77
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,857
我一直在尝试修理这个愚蠢的老等离子路由器，
I've been trying to fix this stupid old plasma router,

78
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,772
这对于我的植入物应该很简单，
which should be easy with my implant,

79
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:56,861
但塞里托斯的系统太旧了。
but the Cerritos systems are too old.

80
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:59,516
你爱塞里托斯。别听他的，女孩。
You love the Cerritos. Don't listen to him, girl.

81
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:01,692
- 他不是那个意思。 - 是的，我是。
- He didn't mean it. - Yes, I did.

82
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,260
[叹气] 从什么时候开始大家都把工作带到酒吧？
[sighs] Since when does everyone bring work to the bar?

83
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:05,827
我希望我能帮助你，拉瑟福德，
I wish I could help you, Rutherford,

84
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:08,046
但我从这个我从另维度偷来的PADD上
but there's not a lot of engineering advice

85
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,005
没有多少工程建议。
on this PADD I stole from alt-dimension me.

86
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:11,746
我无法相信以那个东西为基础
I cannot believe basing your personality

87
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,400
来塑造你的个性居然真的管用。
on that thing actually worked.

88
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:15,315
那个胡子看起来不错。我讨厌它。
That beard looks good. I hate it.

89
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:16,707
我其实并没有抄得那么多。
I didn't actually crib all that much.

90
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:18,274
嗯哼。你想喝点什么？
Uh-huh. What do you want to drink?

91
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,189
呃，呃，叫做布兰布尔的东西？
Uh, uh, something called a Bramble?

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,408
[设备发出嗶嗶声]
[device beeping]

93
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,888
你收到了消息，博伊姆斯。
You're getting a message, Boims.

94
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,629
威廉：不，不，一定有我们可以做的事。
WILLIAM: No, th-there has to be something we can do.

95
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:27,370
马里纳：难道你不是要让整个宇宙都毁灭吗？
MARINER: Won't you be dooming an entire universe?

96
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,458
威廉：扫描我。使用我的现实。
WILLIAM: Scan me. Use my reality.

97
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,678
你为什么要这样对你的朋友？
Why would you do this to your friends?

98
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,854
抱歉，复制器没有布兰布的代码……
Sorry, the replicator didn't have a code for a Bramb...

99
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:35,030
天啊，我们都要死了！
Holy [bleep], we're all gonna die!

100
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,859
什么-什么鬼？博伊姆斯，等一下！我们在尖叫什么？
What-what the hell? Boims, wait up! What are we screaming about?

101
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,427
- [博伊姆尔在远处尖叫] - [玻璃破碎]
- [Boimler screaming in distance] - [glass shattering]

102
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,124
是我一个人这样，还是博伊姆尔
Is it just me, or is Boimler

103
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:43,908
总是对一些PADD感到恐慌？
always freaking out about some PADD?

104
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:45,997
- 不止是你。 - [咕咕声]
- It is not just you. - [grunts]

105
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,217
[金属碰撞声]
[metal clatters]

106
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,786
弗里曼：塔波尔？哈里·金姆？
FREEMAN: T'Pol? Harry Kims?

107
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:54,136
一个跨维度的过载？
An interdimensional overload?

108
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,486
船长，如果威廉还活着，他不会在这方面撒谎。
Captain, if William's alive, he wouldn't lie about this.

109
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,619
妈妈，我知道这来得很突然
Mom, I know this is coming from nowhere

110
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:00,098
而且我们只是初级军官，
and we're just junior officers,

111
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,883
但我们必须认真对待。
but we have to take it seriously.

112
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,928
- 我同意。 - 哦。你真这么想？
- I agree. - Oh. You do?

113
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:06,670
- 现在就让指挥部来联系。 - 哇，真的？
- Let's get Command on the line now. - Whoa, what, really?

114
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,629
我是说，我们以为需要更多的说服力。
I mean, we thought it would take way more convincing.

115
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,718
是啊，我是说，一个不死的传输克隆
Yeah, I mean, an-an undead transporter clone

116
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:12,241
可能有点牵强。
could be kind of a stretch.

117
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,895
你们两个是我最好的官员。
You two are my best officers.

118
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:15,331
毕竟我们经历的一切，
And after all we've been through,

119
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:16,941
我想我足够了解可以信任你。
I think I know enough to trust you.

120
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:19,291
哇。我是说，谢谢。
Wow. I mean, thanks.

121
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,642
伙计，那真是个好船长。
Man, that is good captaining.

122
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,168
[马’啊抱怨]
[Ma'ah grumbling]

123
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,694
哎，为什么这么紧张，兄弟？
Eh, why so tense, brother?

124
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,044
我们还有几个小时才能到达Qo'noS。
We still have hours before we arrive at Qo'noS.

125
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,220
船长必须保持警惕。
A captain must be vigilant.

126
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:37,788
我们送来血酒。我们会遇到什么危险？
We deliver bloodwine. What danger would we encounter?

127
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,399
一个漏水的桶？
A leaky barrel?

128
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:41,662
- 每个任务都是一场潜在的战斗。- [哈欠]
- Every mission is a potential battle. - [yawns]

129
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,490
如果卡赫利斯再次出现就叫我。
Wake me if Kahless makes another appearance.

130
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,274
- [警报响起] - [喊]
- [alarm blares] - [shouts]

131
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,536
[倒吸气]
[gasps]

132
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:55,545
- [尖叫] - 马’啊：雷尔加。
- [screeching] - MA'AH: Relga.

133
00:06:55,719 --> 00:07:00,245
啊，伟大的马’啊船长，运送垃圾。
Ah, the great Captain Ma'ah, hauling garbage.

134
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,943
这不是垃圾。是酒！
It's not garbage. It's wine!

135
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:04,946
强者如何堕落，谋杀者。
How the mighty have fallen, murderer.

136
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:06,687
这是什么意思？
What is the meaning of this?

137
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,516
你毁掉了我的一艘船。我很幸运能活下来。
You destroyed one of my ships. I was lucky to survive.

138
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,648
我们不知道你在说什么。
We don't know what you're talking about.

139
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,650
我知道，但有足够的真相
I know, but there's just enough truth

140
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,478
来说服高级委员会。
to convince the High Council.

141
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:16,784
准备武器。
Ready weapons.

142
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:19,177
- 这太疯狂了！ - 不，这是报复。
- This is madness! - No, it's vengeance.

143
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,963
瑞尔加没有荣誉，就像她的兄弟们一样。
Relga has no honor, just like her brothers.

144
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:25,096
巴赫和多尔格很弱。我不是！
Bargh and Dorg were weak. I am not!

145
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,663
开火！
Fire!

146
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:29,449
[咕哝声]
[grunts]

147
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,149
- [咕哝声] - [抽泣声]
- [grunts] - [whimpers]

148
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,585
我会撞毁他们的桥。
I will ram their bridge.

149
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:36,978
我们将拥有突然袭击的机会。
We will have the element of surprise.

150
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,328
抱歉，兄弟，但今天不是个好死的日子。
Sorry, brother, but today is not a good day to die.

151
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:40,677
[咕哝声]
[grunts]

152
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,160
马阿：你在做什么？
MA'AH: What are you doing?

153
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:48,729
现在解锁我的控制！马洛！
Unlock my controls now! Malor!

154
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,302
远程扫描已经证实了你的担忧，自由人舰长。
Long-range scans have confirmed your fears, Captain Freeman.

155
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:00,436
孤立波共振正在超载维度裂缝。
Soliton resonance is overloading the dimensional rift.

156
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,831
如果不加以控制，这将摧毁我们的量子现实。
Unchecked, this will destroy our quantum reality.

157
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,746
[所有人倒吸一口气]
[all gasp]

158
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,966
裂缝本身可以用亚空间胶子束轻松密封。
The rift itself is easily sealed with a subspace gluonic beam.

159
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,751
问题在于如何到达那里。
The problem is getting to it.

160
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,274
裂缝被围绕着
The rift is surrounded

161
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:13,797
一个薛定谔可能性场。
by a Schroödinger possibility field.

162
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,233
什么？
A what?

163
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,061
S场完全重新映射物质
The S-field completely remaps matter

164
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:19,499
到多元宇宙中的其他可能性。
into other possibilities from the multiverse.

165
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,457
- [所有人倒吸一口气] - T'LYN: 迷人。
- [all gasp] - T'LYN: Fascinating.

166
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:24,416
当然，我们永远不会选择让一艘加州级船
Of course, we would never choose to have a California-class ship

167
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,157
处理如此规模的灾难。
handle a catastrophe of this scale.

168
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,811
哦，感谢上帝。
Oh, thank God.

169
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,944
一瞬间，听起来这完全由我们决定。
For a moment, it sounded like this was up to us.

170
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,772
不幸的是，是的。
Unfortunately, it is.

171
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:33,382
什么？！为什么？
What?! Why?

172
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:35,210
企业号正在前往，但没有时间了。
Enterprise is en route, but there's no time.

173
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:37,995
两个博伊默尔以我们尚未理解的方式相连。
The two Boimlers are linked in ways we don't yet understand.

174
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:41,956
称其为命运或纠缠，这就是你的使命。
Call it fate or entanglement, this is your mission.

175
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:43,653
我们该怎么做这个，天哪
How the hell are we supposed to do this

176
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,525
如果我们的头变成了仙人掌？
if our heads are turning into cactuses?

177
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,136
我已经计算了你们护盾谐波的调整。
I've calculated adjustments for your shield harmonics.

178
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,225
理论上，它们应该可以阻挡场的影响。
In theory, they should block the effects of the field.

179
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,574
现在发送它们。
Sending them now.

180
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,707
“理论上”？
"In theory"?

181
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,273
工程部可以进行这些更新，舰长，
Engineering can make these updates, Captain,

182
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:56,623
但我们必须全天候工作。
but we'll have to work around the clock.

183
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,581
如果它们真的有效，那就太好了。
It'd be nice to know if they actually work.

184
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:01,410
来吧。你确定企业号应付不了这个？
Come on. Are you sure the Enterprise can't handle this?

185
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:04,282
有了连接的博伊莫尔，你是我们唯一的选择。
With the connected Boimlers, you're our only option.

186
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,763
什么[咕哝]? 你把一个毁灭宇宙的裂缝
What the [bleep]? You sent a universe-destroying rift

187
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,243
发送到你自己的维度？
to your own dimension?

188
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:09,810
不是我。是威廉！
It wasn't me. It was William!

189
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,855
看来博伊莫尔没有给我们选择。
Looks like the Boimlers have given us no choice.

190
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,378
- [大家 groan] - 大家快点。
- [all groan] - Let's move, people.

191
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:15,903
来吧！是威廉！
Come on! It was William!

192
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,600
梅瑞迪斯：我们得安裝那些更新。
MEREDITH: We got to get those updates installed.

193
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,298
[grunt]
[grunts]

194
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:21,473
这些等离子导管是古老的。
These plasma conduits are ancient.

195
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,432
我们永远无法及时冲洗它们。
We're never gonna flush them in time.

196
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,303
我的植入物可以快两倍地做到这一点
My implant could do this twice as fast

197
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,218
如果我们不必使用历史上最古老的中继器。
if we didn't have to use history's oldest relays.

198
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:28,437
明白了。
Got it.

199
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:30,482
量子过滤正在进行中。
Quantum filtering is live.

200
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,354
防护罩已更新，舰长，
Shields are updated, Captain,

201
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,530
但我认为星际舰队没有考虑到船体。
but I don't think Starfleet took into account the hull.

202
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:35,792
弗里曼 [通过通信]: 什么？你什么意思？
FREEMAN [over comm]: What? What do you mean?

203
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:37,620
似乎存在潜在的干扰
There seems to be a potential interference

204
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,666
场与铀钛合金之间
between the field and the duranium alloys

205
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,015
遍布整艘塞里托斯号。
throughout the Cerritos.

206
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,364
这可能会影响船体，
It could affect the hull,

207
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:43,844
但防护罩的更新应该确保
but the shield updates should make sure

208
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:46,237
船员不受影响，所以我们都会没事！
that the crew is unaffected, so we'll all be fine!

209
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,630
船体是很重要的。
The hull is kind of important.

210
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:49,414
比卢普斯: 我们正在修复。
BILLUPS: We're working on a fix.

211
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,547
- 我们只需要更多时间。- 好吧，时间很紧迫。
- We just need more time. - Well, time's in short supply.

212
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:54,115
但只要没有任何复杂情况，我们就应该没问题。
But we should be okay as long as there aren't any complications.

213
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,682
[警报声响起]
[alert blares]

214
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,161
舰长，一艘小飞船刚刚脱离跃迁。
Captain, a small vessel just dropped out of warp.

215
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:58,162
他们在呼唤我们。
They're hailing us.

216
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,860
该死。屏幕上。
Damn it. On screen.

217
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,905
我们需要和贝基特·马里纳谈谈。
We need to talk to Beckett Mariner.

218
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,037
[两人都在 grunt]
[both grunting]

219
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,386
她是我家族的家族。
She is my cha'DIch's cha'DIch.

220
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:06,127
我们请求庇护。
We are requesting asylum.

221
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:08,346
呃…是的，嘿，大家，时机有点不对。
Uh... yeah, hey, guys, sort of bad timing.

222
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,435
好的。我不想申请庇护。
Good. I do not want asylum.

223
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:11,828
- 是的，你要的！ - 啊，我才不要！
- Yes, you do! - Ugh, I do not!

224
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,178
是的，我不知道他们在说什么。
Yeah, I don't know what they're talking about.

225
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,616
[呻吟] 那我想我们最好去弄清楚。
[groans] Then I guess we'd better find out.

226
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,574
马洛尔：哦，来吧。
MALOR: Oh, come on.

227
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:21,142
我们离瑞尔加还远着呢，当她的船受到损坏时。
We were nowhere near Relga when her ship was damaged.

228
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,231
他们可能遇到了相同的孤子波。
They probably encountered the same soliton wave

229
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,885
我们正在处理。
we're dealing with.

230
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,974
瑞尔加因我杀了她的兄弟而寻求复仇。
Relga seeks revenge because I killed her brothers.

231
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:28,584
呃，好的，让我插一句。
Uh, yeah, let me just hop in here.

232
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,499
这两个家伙都先想杀了他。
Both of those guys tried to kill him first.

233
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,849
我会高兴地在战斗中面对她而死！
I will gladly die facing her in battle!

234
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:35,156
来吧，她永远不会给你一个公平的战斗！
Come on, she will never give you a fair fight!

235
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,766
我们可以给他们安全的避风港，对吧，妈妈？
We can give them safe harbor, right, Mom?

236
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:39,290
是的，但限制在船舱内。
Yes, but confined to quarters.

237
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:41,771
抱歉，但显然，我们是唯一可以
Sorry, but apparently, we're the only ones

238
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,730
拯救今天这个该死的宇宙的人。
who can save the frickin' universe today.

239
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,210
那么，这些船舱，嗯，有复制器吗？
So, do these quarters, um, have a replicator?

240
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:49,344
你是怎么在战斗后还有食欲的？
How do you have an appetite after running from battle?

241
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,128
我们所有的零食都是用虫子做的。
All our snacks are made of bugs.

242
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,000
他们有咸味和甜味的！
They have salties and sweets!

243
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,610
RANSOM：船长，我们需要你在舰桥上。
RANSOM: Captain, we need you on the bridge.

244
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:56,525
更多的克林贡刚刚脱离了超空间。
More Klingons just dropped out of warp.

245
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,657
- 什么？ - 好。
- What? - Good.

246
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,049
我们没有时间处理这个。
We don't have time for this.

247
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,095
我们本该在闭合一个裂口。
We're supposed to be closing a rift.

248
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,933
显示屏。
On screen.

249
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,631
我想你是Relga？
I'm assuming you're Relga?

250
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:18,329
我已追踪到两个谋杀犯在这个地点。
I have tracked two murderers to this location.

251
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,983
现在把他们交出来！
Hand them over now!

252
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,551
我相信我们可以以外交方式解决这个问题。
I'm sure we can solve this in a diplomatic fashion.

253
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,684
你在庇护罪犯。
You are harboring criminals.

254
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:26,337
他们会不同意。
They would disagree.

255
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,775
我知道你是谁，船长卡罗尔·弗里曼。
I know who you are, Captain Carol Freeman.

256
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:31,255
你的海军上将伙伴不会保护你免受我的侵害。
Your admiral mate will not protect you from me.

257
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:33,867
我丈夫与此事无关。
My husband has nothing to do with this.

258
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:37,392
你和破坏我船的petaQs站在了一起。
You've sided with the petaQs who destroyed my ship.

259
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:38,959
你是同谋吗？
Are you an accomplice?

260
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,004
来自弗里曼海军上将的来电，船长。
Incoming call from Admiral Freeman, Captain.

261
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,266
[叹气] 现在怎么了？
[sighs] What now?

262
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,007
好的。让她保持通话。
Okay. Put her on hold.

263
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,356
没有人能让我保持通话...
Nobody puts me on hol...

264
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,358
弗里曼：佐...
FREEMAN: Zo...

265
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:48,795
我们部分更新了我们的护盾，
we've partially updated our shields,

266
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,710
我们应该能够前往裂缝...
and we should be able to head to the rift...

267
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,581
你在庇护两个罪犯克林贡，船长。
You're harboring two criminal Klingons, Captain.

268
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,322
[笑] 消息传得真快。
[chuckles] Word travels fast.

269
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:56,324
我不相信他们犯了任何罪。
I don't believe they've committed any crime.

270
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:58,021
他们是谋杀犯。我命令你
They're murderers. I'm ordering you

271
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,807
立即将他们交给雷尔加船长。
to immediately hand them over to Captain Relga.

272
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,156
爸爸，这些是我的朋友。
Dad, these are my friends.

273
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,592
这是来自指挥部的通知吗？
Is this coming from Command?

274
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,855
佐，我...
Zo, I...

275
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:08,118
- 这很奇怪。 - 今天整天都很奇怪！
- That was weird. - This whole day is weird!

276
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,599
[叹气] 兰萨姆，收集我们的客人。
[sighs] Ransom, collect our guests.

277
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,209
什么？不！这是[哔]。
What? No! This is [bleep].

278
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:14,646
我们不能仅仅因为涉及朋友就制定自己的规则。
We can't make our own rules just because friends are involved.

279
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:15,909
给我那个克林贡。
Get me that Klingon.

280
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,607
富里曼！你会后悔那一天...
Freeman! You will rue the day...

281
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,957
够了！你得到了你想要的。
Enough! You're getting what you want.

282
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:23,046
啊，他来了。
Ah, there he is.

283
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,569
不再逃跑，懦夫。
No more running, coward.

284
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,223
- 你才是懦夫！ - 等等。
- You are the coward! - Wait.

285
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:28,182
胖子在哪里？
Where's the fat one?

286
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,706
兰萨姆，为什么我只有一个克林贡？
Ransom, why do I only have one Klingon?

287
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,056
兰萨姆：正在处理。马洛似乎已经，呃，
RANSOM: Working on it. Malor seems to have, uh,

288
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,536
- 走开了。 - 好的。
- wandered off. - Good.

289
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,146
这是一个把戏。
This is a trick.

290
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,670
传感器找不到他。我有一个团队在船上搜索。
Sensors can't locate him. I have a team sweeping the ship.

291
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,498
请耐心等待。
Please be patient.

292
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,326
我们实际上正在处理一个危险的裂缝
We're actually dealing with a dangerous rift

293
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,850
正在释放奇怪的能量。
that's emitting strange energy.

294
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,200
作为盟友，我给你发送数据
As allies, I'm sending you the data

295
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,854
关于如何更新你的护盾。
on how to update your shields.

296
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,943
我对这个没有用！
I have no use for this!

297
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:52,989
把两个兄弟都给我们，否则我会强行带走他们！
Give us both brothers or I will take them by force!

298
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,298
- [大家喘息] - 胡'tegh！
- [all gasp] - Hu'tegh!

299
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:00,997
- 他们瞄准了我们的引擎！ - 红色警报！
- They're targeting our engines! - Red alert!

300
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:03,521
SHAXS: 护盾在80%。
SHAXS: Shields at 80%.

301
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:05,045
机动规避！
Evasive maneuvers!

302
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:17,100
设定前往裂缝的航线。
Set a course for the rift.

303
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,754
- 但是，舰长... - 我们没有时间打斗。
- But, Captain... - We don't have time for a fight.

304
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,016
让我进入曲速。
Warp me.

305
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:35,510
我需要关于那些护盾更新的好消息，比卢普斯先生。
I need good news on those shield updates, Mr. Billups.

306
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,468
那些克林贡人离我们肯定不远。
Those Klingons can't be far behind.

307
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,035
比卢普斯: 正在处理。
BILLUPS: Working on it.

308
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,776
- 妈，我没有藏马洛尔。 - 弗里曼: 我知道。
- Mom, I didn't hide Malor. - FREEMAN: I know.

309
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,822
但我仍然需要你现在找到他。
But I still need you to find him now.

310
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,607
那些克林贡人正在把我们逼入一种糟糕的境地。
Those Klingons are forcing us into a bad situation.

311
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,914
博伊姆勒: 我们正在接近薛定谔场。
BOIMLER: We're approaching the Schroödinger field.

312
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:58,054
舰长，如果没有护盾更新，
Captain, without the shield update,

313
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,839
将会对船体产生量子干扰
quantum interference with the hull

314
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,058
可能改变塞里托斯的物理结构。
could alter the physical structure of the Cerritos.

315
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:03,799
好吧，不管我们变成什么
Well, whatever we turn into

316
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,106
总比被克林贡人炸毁要好。
is still better than getting blown up by Klingons.

317
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:07,107
全速推进。
Full impulse.

318
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,804
是，船长。
Aye, Captain.

319
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,507
赎金：孤子能量与铝合金反应。
RANSOM: Soliton energy's reacting with the duranium.

320
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:17,857
读数变得奇怪！
Readings are getting freaky!

321
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:21,034
全员，准备迎接怪异情况。
All hands, brace for weird.

322
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,870
- 报告。 - 我们只有一个推进器。
- Report. - We only have one nacelle.

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,523
我们在一个塞里托斯的现实中，
We're in the Cerritos from a reality

324
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,003
那里是自由级。
where it's a Freedom-class.

325
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,092
你怎么能用一个推进器进入超光速？
How do you even go to warp with one nacelle?

326
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,486
在没有双推进器的情况下投射一个超光速气泡是可能的。
It's possible to project a warp bubble without dual nacelles.

327
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,444
唯一的牺牲是静态执行器……
The only sacrifice is the static actuators...

328
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:41,881
我们没有时间对此进行详细讨论，中尉。
We don't have time to nerd out about this, Lieutenant.

329
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,360
- [警报响起] - 我们的朋友们刚刚赶上。
- [alert rings] - Our friends just caught up.

330
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,579
当然，他们赶上了。
Of course they did.

331
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,934
保持速度。我们必须到达那个裂缝。
Maintain speed. We have to get to that rift.

332
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,851
谢克斯：克林贡人已经进入S场，船长，
SHAXS: The Klingons have entered the S-field, Captain,

333
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,766
我们的护盾只达到了60%。
and our shields are only at 60%.

334
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,595
另一股能量波，正前方。
Another energy wave, dead ahead.

335
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,207
- 马洛尔：马洛尔！- 海员：马洛尔！
- MA'AH: Malor! - MARINER: Malor!

336
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:06,209
现在就出来，让我们面对敌人。
Get out here right now so we can face our enemies.

337
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,255
你不这样做吗？你会吓到他的。
Would you not? You're gonna scare him.

338
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:10,344
- [飞船轰鸣] - [两人惊呼]
- [ship rumbling] - [both exclaiming]

339
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:13,216
马洛尔，拜托——可不可以出来，马洛尔？
Malor, just-- c-could you get out here, please, Malor?

340
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,090
哇！
Whoa!

341
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:19,527
该死！愚蠢的新量子现实能量中继器。
Dang it! Stupid new quantum reality power relays.

342
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:21,921
- 移植问题？- 不，它工作得很好。
- Implant trouble? - No, it's working great.

343
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,313
但这些新系统一团糟。
But these new systems are a mess.

344
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:24,575
谁设计的这种飞船？
Who designs a ship like this?

345
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:25,968
- [爆炸] - 啊！
- [explosion] - Ah!

346
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,148
他们的其中一艘飞船正在改变。
One of their ships is changing.

347
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:40,200
哇，一艘古老的克林贡帆船。
Oof, an ancient Klingon sailing barge.

348
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,331
所有生命都失去了。
All lives lost.

349
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:42,942
那会发生在我们身上吗？
Can that happen to us?

350
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:45,248
我真的很需要那个护盾升级，比绥尔先生。
I could really use that shield update, Mr. Billups.

351
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,294
博伊默中尉，去导航。
Lieutenant Boimler, get to navigation.

352
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:49,949
我们不能偏离航线。
We can't afford to go off course.

353
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:52,212
[通过公共广播系统]：全体人员到达各自岗位。
[over P.A.]: All hands to your stations.

354
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:54,040
我们需要更新我们的中继器。
We need to update our relays.

355
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,911
塞里托斯号并不是为这种压力设计的。
The Cerritos wasn't designed for this kind of stress.

356
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:58,174
我们需要禁用非必要系统
We need to disable nonessential systems

357
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,133
以帮助为结构完整性导入电力。
to help route power to structural integrity.

358
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:03,353
负面。禁用系统可能会损坏资源通道。
Negative. Disabling systems could damage resource conduits.

359
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:06,008
是的，如果我们被炸了，资源流就不重要了！
Yeah, resource flow won't matter if we get blown up!

360
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:08,097
提高音量无法解决问题。
Raising your voice will not solve the problem.

361
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,969
什么也不做也同样无济于事！
Neither will doing nothing!

362
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,579
我们是共同的高级科学官。
We are co-senior science officers.

363
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,015
我们应该一起处理这个问题！
We should be working together on this!

364
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,799
看来我们状况的压力
It appears the pressure of our situation

365
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,149
- 正在影响你的逻辑。- [倒吸气]
- is impairing your logic. - [gasps]

366
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,759
也许我们应该处理不同的系统。
Perhaps we should work on different systems.

367
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,674
也许我们应该。
Perhaps we should.

368
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:21,981
[咕哝，踢]
[grunting, kicking]

369
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:24,374
我无法让任何一条绝缘线中继器稳定。
I can't get any of the isolinear relays stabilized.

370
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,463
是这艘船。我...
It's this ship. I...

371
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,031
我想我对塞里托斯号的爱正在减弱。
I think I'm falling out of love with the Cerritos.

372
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:31,120
什么？但还有很多需要修复的地方。
What? But there's so much more to fix.

373
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:32,513
也许这只是一个艰难的阶段。
Maybe this is just a rough patch.

374
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:33,862
我就是这么想的。
That's what I thought.

375
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:36,604
但是情况就是没有好转。
But it just isn't getting better.

376
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:49,747
- MARINER: Malor? - 这太不光彩了！现在就出来！
- MARINER: Malor? - This is dishonorable! Get out here now!

377
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,401
Malor？嘿，Kimolu，Matt，
Malor? Hey, Kimolu, Matt,

378
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,360
你看见一个乡村克林贡从这里进来吗？
you see a rural Klingon come in through here?

379
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,321
唔！如果我能找到他，我们就可以停止这场冲突。
Ugh! If I could only find him, we could stop this conflict.

380
00:16:58,408 --> 00:16:59,975
等一下。我知道我用这个PADD太多了，
Wait. I know I use this PADD too much,

381
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,933
但是也许像这样的事情发生过
but maybe something like this happened

382
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,457
在Beard Boimler的现实中。
in Beard Boimler's reality.

383
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,414
你知道吗？老实说，我会接受任何帮助。
You know what? Honestly, I'll take any help.

384
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:05,850
检查，检查。
Check, check.

385
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,852
- MA'AH: Malor! Malor! - 哇。
- MA'AH: Malor! Malor! - Whoa.

386
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,202
你是真的找到什么了吗？
You actually found something?

387
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,465
这是一本关于克林贡寻求庇护的日志。
It's a log about Klingons seeking asylum.

388
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,728
- Becky Mariner是藏匿他们的人。- 什么？！
- Becky Mariner is the one who hid them. - What?!

389
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,425
哇，这并不意味着我做了。
Whoa, that doesn't mean I did.

390
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,340
- 她是个麻烦人物。- 我弟弟在哪里？
- She was a piece of work. - Where is my brother?

391
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:19,690
- 我没有藏他。- 这里说你藏了！
- I didn't hide him. - This says you did!

392
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:21,344
揭露他的所在地！
Reveal his location!

393
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:24,086
- 伙计们，伙计们，我们能专注于修理吗？- [ grunt ]
- Guys, guys, can we focus on repairs? - [grunts]

394
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,570
- [轰鸣声] - BOIMLER: 哇。
- [rumbling] - BOIMLER: Whoa.

395
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,180
小心。我们又要改变了。
Look out. We're changing again.

396
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:38,274
塞里托斯号现在是一艘地球帝国舰船。
The Cerritos is a Terran Empire ship now.

397
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:41,582
啊，真是神明保佑，我们的武器真棒！
Ah, by the prophets, our weapons are amazing!

398
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,890
哦！武器失效了。啊！
Oh! Weapons are down. Aah!

399
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,415
瑞尔佳，请理智一点。
Relga, please be reasonable.

400
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,504
这个区域本身就很危险。
This field is dangerous as it is.

401
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:53,376
你本不该给我盾牌更新的，人类。
You never should have given me the shield updates, human.

402
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,422
现在把那些逃犯交出来！
Now hand over those fugitives!

403
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,042
[叫喊，喘息]
[exclaiming, grunting]

404
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,697
告诉我我们还有护盾。
Tell me we still have shields.

405
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,177
勉强有，但引擎失效了。
Barely, but engines are down.

406
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:12,656
我们在太空中死了。
We're dead in space.

407
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:13,918
FREEMAN: 我不明白。
FREEMAN: I don't get it.

408
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:15,355
她的船为什么不变化？
Why isn't her ship changing?

409
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:16,921
她可能在变化。
It probably is.

410
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,662
克林贡人几乎从不更新他们的舰队设计。
Klingons hardly ever update their fleet designs.

411
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:21,187
他们总是想让他们的船看起来像大愚蠢的鸟。
They always want their ships to look like big stupid birds.

412
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:23,406
我们有基本的动力系统，但就只是这些。
We have basic power systems, but that's it.

413
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,582
我的团队仍在努力修复干扰，
My team's still working to fix interference,

414
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:27,106
但这让我们更加落后。
but this set us back even more.

415
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,282
我们必须假设我们会被登船。
We have to assume we'll be boarded.

416
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,022
在这种情况下，我认为我们必须交出那个...
In that case, I think we have to hand over the...

417
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,242
- 弗里曼船长！ - [惊叫]
- Captain Freeman! - [exclaims]

418
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:36,245
这个紫色小子有证据证明马里纳隐藏了我的兄弟。
This purple boy has proof that Mariner has hidden my brother.

419
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,029
妈妈，我不会对你撒谎。
Mom, I wouldn't lie to you.

420
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,640
我是说，你知道的，不再撒谎了。
I mean, you know, not anymore.

421
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,381
我知道。我信任你。
I know. I trust you.

422
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,861
马洛尔的所在位置隐藏在这个设备的某个地方。
Malor's location is hidden somewhere on this device.

423
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,211
- [ grunt ] - 把PADD给我！
- [grunts] - Give me the PADD!

424
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:48,692
[ grunt ]
[grunts]

425
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,694
- 巴卡！ - 博伊姆斯，那东西是为你工作的。
- Ba-Qa'! - Boims, that thing was working for you.

426
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,566
你真帅又酷。
You're so handsome and cool.

427
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:54,785
如果意味着不支持你，我不想让它出现在我的生活中。
I don't want it in my life if it means not having your back.

428
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,136
哦，伙计，那实际上-- 真的是太甜了。
Oh, man, that's actually-- That's really sweet.

429
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,050
你是比胡子博伊姆尔更好的朋友。
You're a better friend than Beard Boimler.

430
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,487
我不需要PADD来知道这一点。
I don't need a PADD to know that.

431
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,141
- 友谊！ - 马阿：不！
- Friendship! - MA'AH: No!

432
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,055
如果你不告诉我马洛尔在哪里，
If you will not tell me where Malor is,

433
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,449
我就要在战斗中让你告诉我！
I will have to make you, in battle!

434
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,364
[咆哮]
[growling]

435
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:13,282
[痛苦的 grunt] 你怎么这么强？
[pained grunt] How a-are you s-so strong?

436
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:15,502
高强度间歇训练。
High intensity interval training.

437
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:16,894
这已经太过分了。
This has gone too far.

438
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,026
- 我藏了马洛。 - 什么？
- I hid Malor. - What?

439
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:20,333
- 哈！我[屏蔽]早就知道了。 - 为啥？
- Ha! I [bleep] knew it. - Why?

440
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:22,900
弗里曼海军上将的那条消息让我觉得不对劲。
That message from Admiral Freeman didn't sit right.

441
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:25,555
是的。谢谢你。妈妈，听起来不像爸爸。
Yes. Thank you. Mom, it did not sound like Dad.

442
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:28,602
我们答应了马洛庇护，雷尔加是个恶霸。
We promised Malor asylum, and Relga's a bully.

443
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,386
我知道你必须遵循命令，
I knew you had to follow orders,

444
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:32,780
所以我给了你时间和一点可信的否认。
so I bought you time and some plausible deniability.

445
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,521
那不是你的决定，杰克。
That wasn't your call, Jack.

446
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:37,132
乌赞尼，当光线照射过山峰时。
Uzani, when the light came over the mountain.

447
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,221
我们不需要看这个。他的命令是明确的。
We don't need to watch this. His orders were clear.

448
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:41,528
金扎，当真相被揭露时。
Jinza, when the truth was uncovered.

449
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:44,966
他们是杀人犯。我命令你立即把他们交出来……
They're murderers. I'm ordering you to immediately hand them...

450
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:47,360
啊，她伪造了消息。
Ah, she faked the message.

451
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:49,536
该死。这真是不光彩。
Damn. That is so dishonorable.

452
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,713
我们不能把他们交出去，但我们也不能反击。
We can't hand them over, but we can't fight back.

453
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,584
[叹气] 这是一个不可能的局面。
[sighs] This is an impossible situation.

454
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:55,890
我不敢相信我们有特兰武器
I can't believe we have Terran weapons

455
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,805
但没有办法为它们供电。
and no way to power them.

456
00:19:57,935 --> 00:19:59,981
必须有一些狡猾的下三滥科克式把戏
There has to be some sneaky underhanded Kirk-style trick

457
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,505
我们可以用来搞砸她，就像他们在以前那样。
we can use to [bleep] her up, like they did in the old days.

458
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,247
[倒吸气]我的一个军官可能能帮忙。
[gasps] One of my officers might be able to help with that.

459
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:13,386
你真的要让我登上你的船吗？
Are you really going to make me board you?

460
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,953
拯救一些生命。不要这么软弱。
Save some lives. Don't be so weak.

461
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,478
好吧，至少我不用假装发一条消息。
Well, at least I didn't have to fake a message.

462
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,131
什么？[ chuckles ]
What? [chuckles]

463
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,525
可惜你发现了我的把戏。
A pity you discovered my trick.

464
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,571
现在你的船员必须死！
Now your crew has to die!

465
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,574
你知道吗，你说得对。
You know, you were right.

466
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,358
我真的不应该分享那个护盾更新。
I really shouldn't have shared that shield update.

467
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,186
我想我就只能把它拿走。
Guess I'll just have to take it away.

468
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,493
我想看看你怎么尝试。
I'd like to see you try.

469
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,582
[雷声轰鸣]
[thunder crashing]

470
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,934
[用力]
[straining]

471
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:42,893
开火！
Open fire!

472
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,245
[喊]
[shouts]

473
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,211
有效了！我做到了，比卢普斯先生！
It worked! I did it, Mr. Billups!

474
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:58,735
哈！你的小把戏根本没用！
Ha! Your little trick did nothing!

475
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,476
舰长，我们的护盾失效了。
Captain, our shields are down.

476
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:02,391
我们完全暴露在能量场中。
We are fully exposed to the energy field.

477
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:03,827
什么？不。
What? No.

478
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,655
攻击他们！摧毁他们！
Fire on them! Destroy them!

479
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:09,659
[尖叫]
[screaming]

480
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,444
[呻吟]
[groaning]

481
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:13,968
[喉音尖叫]
[guttural screams]

482
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:15,970
[低吼]
[snarling]

483
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:19,452
[咆哮]
[roars]

484
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:22,672
呃。他们正在变成什么？
Ugh. What are they turning into?

485
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,675
无意识的原始克林贡，充满愤怒。
Mindless proto-Klingons, filled with rage.

486
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:27,286
[咆哮]
[roars]

487
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,862
- [警报声] - 波频率正在上升，舰长。
- [alarm beeps] - Wave frequency is increasing, Captain.

488
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,516
全体成员，准备迎接撞击。
All hands, brace for impact.

489
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:46,479
[吸气]
[gasps]

490
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,220
舰长，塞里托斯号正在运行。
Captain, the Cerritos is operational.

491
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,485
我们已经完全变成了主权级。
We've gone all Sovereign-class.

492
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:55,488
我想我得接管它。
I guess I'll have to take it.

493
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:57,316
指挥官，带我们去裂缝。
Helm, get us to the rift.

494
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,230
我们越接近，影响就会越大。
The closer we get, the more the effects will increase.

495
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,580
那么就希望我们能到达。
Then let's hope we make it.

496
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,581
全速前进！
Full impulse!

497
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,476
嘿！我们回到正常了。
Hey! We're back to normal.

498
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,260
是的，我们是。
Yeah, we are.

499
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:30,697
[喘气] 我们是！
[gasps] We are!

500
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,960
舰长，裂缝扩展得太快了。
Captain, the rift is expanding too quickly.

501
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,831
我们不会及时到达的！
We won't get there in time!

502
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,181
为什么我们不能换成一艘更大、更好的船？
Why couldn't we have changed into a bigger, better ship?

503
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,488
拉萨福德 [通过通讯]: 没有更好的船！
RUTHERFORD [over comm]: There is no better ship!

504
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:41,838
- 拉萨福德？ - 加利级船是最棒的！
- Rutherford? - The Cali-class rules!

505
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:44,363
我们对此非常合适。[ grunt ]
We're perfect for this. [grunts]

506
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:45,059
田迪：但我以为你不再爱了。
TENDI: But I thought you were falling out of love.

507
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:46,626
是的，但我后来意识到
Yeah, but then I realized

508
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:47,888
我的问题不在于塞里托斯。
my problems aren't with the Cerritos.

509
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,585
而在于我的植入物。
They're with my implant.

510
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,414
[ grunt ]
[grunts]

511
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:54,111
是时候采用老派的方法了。
Time to do this the old-fashioned way.

512
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:56,331
[ grunt ] 这些 计算机 是 被 设计 的
[grunts] These Calis were designed

513
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,637
为了 所有 种类 的 功能。
for all sorts of functionality.

514
00:22:57,724 --> 00:23:00,117
我们 可以 重新配置 系统 比 任何人 都好。
We can reconfigure systems better than anyone.

515
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:03,207
哇！ 我从未见过有人 这么快 地 工程。
Whoa! I've never seen someone engineer that fast.

516
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,514
[ chanting ]： 拉塞福德！ 拉塞福德！
[chanting]: Rutherford! Rutherford!

517
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,647
- 拉塞福德！ 拉塞福德！ - [ beeping ]
- Rutherford! Rutherford! - [beeping]

518
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,039
他 正在 将 裂缝 的 能量
He's routing the rift's energy

519
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,824
直接 输入 到 费米箱 里。
directly into the dilithium chamber.

520
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:13,392
我们 正在 被 异维度性 本身 供能。
We are being fueled by interdimensionality itself.

521
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:15,524
结果 将 会 是 不可预测 的。
The results will be unpredictable.

522
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,221
这 将 是 必须的。
It'll have to do.

523
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,534
- [ 所有 gasp ] - [ echo ]： 发生 了 什么？
- [all gasp] - [echoes]: What's happening?

524
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,409
我们的 超位置 正在 解耦！
Our superpositions are decoupling!

525
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,803
弗里曼： 塞里托斯 正 在 分叉 成 两个 量子 可能性。
FREEMAN: The Cerritos is bifurcating into two quantum possibilities.

526
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:36,066
如果 我们 维持 这个 速度， 它们 都会 被 毁灭。
If we maintain this speed, they'll both be destroyed.

527
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:37,720
我们 没有 选择。
We don't have a choice.

528
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,461
保持 我们 的 方向， 博伊姆勒 先生。
Keep us on course, Mr. Boimler.

529
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,898
在 尝试， 船长，但 驾驶室 不 在 响应。
Trying, Captain, but the helm's not responding.

530
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,596
沙克斯： 系统 已 经 分裂。
SHAXS: Systems are split.

531
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,815
[ 喊 ] 每艘 舰船 正在 控制 另一艘。
[yelps] Each ship is controlling the other.

532
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:48,122
赎金：我们必须减慢速度。
RANSOM: We have to slow down.

533
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,384
- 不！- 不！
- No! - No!

534
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:51,691
今天的混乱使我们分开了。
Today's chaos has driven us apart.

535
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:53,649
但那是我们最需要同步的时候。
But that's when we need to be the most in sync.

536
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:55,956
放弃控制。互相信任。
Relinquish control. Trust each other.

537
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:57,958
之前，我们必须证明自己。
Before, we had to prove ourselves.

538
00:23:58,088 --> 00:23:59,829
现在我们团结为...
Now we unite as...

539
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,049
- 科学好朋友。- 科学好朋友！
- Science besties. - Science besties!

540
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:16,803
什么...？
Wha...?

541
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,978
[小组发出咕哝声]
[group grunts]

542
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:19,588
[喘气] 兄弟？
[pants] Brother?

543
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:20,763
[小组尖叫]
[group screams]

544
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:26,595
赎金：舰长，我们在范围内！
RANSOM: Captain, we're in range!

545
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:27,944
激活胶子束。
Active the gluonic beam.

546
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:34,821
没效果。
It's not working.

547
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:36,562
[警报响起]
[alarm rings]

548
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:40,827
腾迪：裂缝仍然开放。
TENDI: The rift is still open.

549
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,524
太迟了！
It's too late!

550
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,094
在我的农场...
On my farm...

551
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:48,182
- 嗯？- 什么？- ...当一条河流威胁
- Huh? - What? - ...when a river threatens

552
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:49,662
摧毁你的庄稼，
to destroy your crops,

553
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:52,926
你无法阻止它，但你可以建一个水坝。
you cannot stop it, but you can build a dam.

554
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:55,842
- 你在说什么？ - [倒抽气] 他是对的。
- What are you talking about? - [gasps] He's right.

555
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:56,886
[咕哝]
[grunts]

556
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,761
[嗡嗡声]
[whirring]

557
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:23,347
BOIMLER: 哇，能量被隔离了。
BOIMLER: Whoa, the energy's contained.

558
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,567
裂缝是稳定的，但它，呃，
The rift is stable, but it's, uh,

559
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:28,135
- 它是永久开放的。 - 天哪 [哔]。
- it's permanently open. - Holy [bleep].

560
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:30,659
等一下，我们刚刚拯救了 [哔] 宇宙？
Wait, did we just save the [bleep] universe?

561
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,140
[欢呼]
[cheering]

562
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:37,666
嗯？ 我们胜利了，因为你听了马洛尔的？
Huh? We are victorious because you listened to Malor?

563
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:39,407
是的。估计兰索姆做了一个正确的决定
Yeah. Guess Ransom made a good call

564
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,062
藏起这个大天才，否则我们就完蛋了。
hiding this big old genius, or we'd be toast.

565
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:44,064
[咕哝] 克林贡人不拥抱。
[grunts] Klingons do not hug.

566
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:46,936
- [笑] - 闭嘴。
- [laughs] - Shut up.

567
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:57,077
BOIMLER: 博伊姆勒的日志。
BOIMLER: Boimler's log.

568
00:25:57,207 --> 00:26:01,124
我们的克林贡朋友正在返回 Qo'noS，
Our Klingon friends are heading back to Qo'noS,

569
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,518
但他们可能没有时间耕种。
but they might not have time for farming.

570
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:05,825
由于她的不光彩行为，
Due to her dishonorable actions,

571
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:08,175
最高委员会移交了瑞尔加的舰队
the High Council handed over Relga's fleet

572
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:10,438
听从马阿赫的命令。
to Ma'ah's command.

573
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,614
现在裂缝已成为一个永久开放的传送门。
Now that the rift is a permanently open portal

574
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,442
到其他量子现实，
to other quantum realities,

575
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,098
星际舰队将其视为通往全新前沿的大门。
Starfleet considers it a gate to a whole new frontier.

576
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:21,797
增强的超光速粒子密度意味着没有现代星际基地
The increased tachyon density means no modern starbase

577
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:24,104
可以驻扎在附近。
can be stationed nearby.

578
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:28,195
幸运的是，有一个较旧的系统没有受到影响。
Luckily, there's one with older systems that aren't affected.

579
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:30,850
星基地80.
Starbase 80.

580
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:36,072
使命：探索奇异的新现实
The mission: explore strange new realities

581
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:38,858
在一些熟悉的朋友的帮助下。
with a little help from some familiar friends.

582
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:40,947
卡西亚仍然在管理基地。
Kassia still runs the base,

583
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,297
但是当涉及到探索多元宇宙时，
but when it comes to exploring the multiverse,

584
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:44,820
星际舰队希望他们的最佳选择
Starfleet wanted their best

585
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:47,780
监督进入裂缝的任务。
to supervise the missions going into the rift.

586
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,788
[轻声喵喵]
[meows softly]

587
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:00,531
这是我的荣幸，舰长。
It's been an honor, Captain.

588
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,404
[哼哼，费力]
[grunts, strains]

589
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,188
- [抽泣] - [呻吟]
- [sniffles] - [groans]

590
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,713
如果你不在这里，谁来把我扔进监禁室？
If you're not here, who's gonna throw me in the brig?

591
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:10,063
当你第一次到达时，
When you first arrived,

592
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:12,326
我没想到你能坚持一周。
I didn't think you'd last a week.

593
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:13,849
是的，我也没想到。
Yeah, neither did I.

594
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,677
- [咕哝] - 现在
- [grunts] - Now

595
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:17,592
我自豪地说你不需要我了。
I'm proud to say that you don't need me.

596
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:19,550
轮到我去冒险了。
It's my turn to go on an adventure.

597
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,509
[抽泣]
[sniffles]

598
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,686
- 我爱你，妈妈。 - 我也爱你。
- I love you, Mom. - I love you, too.

599
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:31,780
难道没有人来帮我提包吗？
Is nobody here to carry my bags?

600
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:33,303
是的，这不是银河级，爸爸。
Yeah, it's not a Galaxy-class, Dad.

601
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,654
- 但我是一名海军上将。 - 那又怎样，你的手臂不工作吗？
- But I'm an admiral. - So what, your arms don't work?

602
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:37,699
我很高兴你们能一起多花些时间。
I'm glad you guys get to spend more time together.

603
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,049
这就是我同意这个的主要原因。
It's the main reason I agreed to this.

604
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,008
- 有高尔夫球场吗？ - 哦，忘了高尔夫。
- There's a golf course, right? - Oh, forget golf.

605
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:43,792
你正在去健身房，伙计。
You're hitting the gym, buddy.

606
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,794
[笑]: 不，谢谢。不适合我。
[laughs]: No, thank you. Not for me.

607
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:47,491
弗里曼：好吧，你可是每天都在给我打电话，
FREEMAN: Well, you're the one who was calling me every day,

608
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,667
非常想念我。
missing me so much.

609
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,146
这不是你想要的吗？
Isn't this what you wanted?

610
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:52,627
我爱你，但我也爱放置。
I love you, but I also love putting.

611
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,585
欢迎来到星际基地80，弗里曼斯。
Welcome to Starbase 80, Freemans.

612
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,109
现在让我们来给你涂抹滑滑的东西
Now let's get you slimed up

613
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,893
用一些自制的消毒凝胶。
with some homemade disinfectant gel.

614
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,897
- 她是在开玩笑，对吧？ - [笑] 你希望如此。
- She's kidding, right? - [laughs] You wish.

615
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,121
哦，拉瑟福德。嘿，你能看一下
Oh, Rutherford. Hey, will you take a look

616
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:10,950
我为--什么？编制的数据吗？
at this data I compiled for-- what?

617
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:12,865
你的植入物在哪里？
Where's your implant?

618
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:15,345
我不得不在塞里托斯和眼罩之间选择。
I had to choose between the Cerritos and the oculus.

619
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:16,825
根本谈不上选择。
Not really a choice at all.

620
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,132
呃，我，我，我不知道该说什么。
Uh, I-I, I-I don't know what to say.

621
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:20,699
工程学现在应该有两倍的趣味
Engineering should be twice as interesting

622
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,309
毕竟我没有网络连接
now that I don't have cybernetics

623
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,789
接入我的大脑。
hooked up to my melon.

624
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,182
不过，感觉如此有机确实很奇怪。
It does feel weird to be so organic, though.

625
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,707
- 呸。 - 我觉得你看起来非常英俊。
- Bleh. - I think you look very handsome.

626
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:31,274
哦！谢谢，滕迪。哇。[笑]
Oh! Thanks, Tendi. Wow. [laughs]

627
00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:32,798
情感可能会变得相当强烈
Emotions can get pretty intense

628
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:34,538
没有多巴胺抑制剂，是吧？
without a dopamine inhibitor, huh?

629
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:37,063
- [轻笑] 哦。- 我不知道你有浪漫情感。
- [chuckles] Ooh. - I was unaware of your romantic affection.

630
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,542
哦，不，我们只是朋友。
Oh, no, we're just friends.

631
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,153
- 我的头感觉热。 - 什么？
- My head feels hot. - What?

632
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:42,329
- 我生病了吗？ - 让我给你量一下体温。
- Am I sick? - Let me take your temperature.

633
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,287
[拉伸，尖叫]
[strains, shrieks]

634
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:46,420
显然我错了。
Clearly I was mistaken.

635
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,377
[ grunt，轻笑]
[grunts, chuckles]

636
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,075
[叹气] 今天真糟糕。
[sighs] What a day.

637
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:50,641
伙计，谁决定在星际飞船上设一个酒吧的？
Man, whoever decided to put a bar on a starship

638
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,208
值得一枚奖牌。
deserves a medal.

639
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:54,820
马里纳，快点，你妈妈要离开塞里托斯了。
Mariner, come on, your mom's leaving the Cerritos.

640
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,996
我们预测你会表现出负面反应。
We had predicted you would express a negative reaction

641
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,259
不符合您等级的身份。
unfitting to the station of your rank.

642
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:03,045
你知道博伊姆勒那个奇怪的假死克隆体为什么吗？
You know why Boimler's weird death-faking clone

643
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:04,830
那个宇宙波是发给我们的吗？
sent that cosmic wave at us?

644
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,920
因为他知道我们表现出色。
Because he knew we kick ass.

645
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,403
而我说的并不只是我们五个人。
And I'm not just talking about the five of us.

646
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:17,843
整个塞里托斯号的船员汇聚了了不起的军官。
The whole Cerritos crew is stacked with amazing officers.

647
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:21,629
是的，舰队中有很多更大的船。
Yeah, there's a lot of ships in the fleet which are bigger,

648
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,849
更花哨，他们有工程部分。
fancier, they have engineering sections

649
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:26,677
附在船的主要部分上的那些东西。
that are attached to the main part of the ship.

650
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:30,856
老实说，那些船员要专业得多。
And honestly, those crews are way more professional.

651
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,729
嘿，我应该知道，我已经被开除过一半。
Hey, I should know, I've been kicked out of half of 'em.

652
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,429
但我们做的这件事不需要完美。
But this thing we do doesn't require perfection.

653
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:42,824
我们是探险者。我们为未知而生。
We're explorers. We live for the unknown.

654
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,783
你无法为此做准备。
You can't prepare for that.

655
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:50,092
在塞里托斯号上没有人接近完美。
Nobody on the Cerritos is even close to perfect.

656
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:52,529
我们是一群人和各种生物的混合体，
We're a mishmash of people and various creatures

657
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,923
在其他地方都无法融入。
that don't fit in anywhere else.

658
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,231
但我们是一家人。
But we're a family.

659
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:01,060
这就是我爱这里的原因。
That's why I love it here.

660
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:06,413
我们相信使命，相信彼此。
We believe in the mission and in each other.

661
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:07,806
我妈妈可能已经离开，
My mom might be gone,

662
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:10,983
但她亲自挑选了这个船员。
but she handpicked this crew.

663
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:15,857
这就是我知道我们会没事的原因。
Which is why I know we're gonna be okay.

664
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:18,468
这不是故事的结束，而是开始。
This isn't the end of the story, it's the beginning.

665
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,122
我们会让她感到骄傲。
We're gonna make her proud.

666
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:23,125
哇，这真是一种健康的看待方式。
Wow, that's such a healthy way of looking at it.

667
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:25,388
是啊。我确实生气了，还把我的床点着了。
Yeah. I did get mad and set my bed on fire.

668
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,260
- 等等，什么？ - 什么？！还在烧吗？
- Wait, what? - What?! Is it still burning?!

669
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,175
是的，我踢了一台计算机，但是你知道，
Yeah, and I kicked a computer, but you know,

670
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:31,090
这已全部出系统。我很好，我想。
that's all out of my system. I'm good, I think.

671
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,743
我--我是说，我不知道。我们得等着看。
I m-- I mean, I don't know. We'll have to wait and see.

672
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,658
[笑] 调整频道。哦哦。
[chuckles] Tune in. Uh-oh.

673
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,835
SHAXS: 舰长在甲板上。
SHAXS: Captain on deck.

674
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:41,970
弗里曼舰长在80号星际基地上，
Captain Freeman's aboard Starbase 80,

675
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:44,494
- 朗萨姆舰长。- 谢谢你，沙克斯先生。
- Captain Ransom. - Thank you, Mr. Shaxs.

676
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,541
你知道，她告诉我永远不要让你引爆曲速核心。
You know, she told me to never let you detonate the warp core.

677
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:49,499
哦，天哪。
Oh, man.

678
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,893
- 除非你真的值得。- 好的！
- Unless you really deserve it. - All right!

679
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,982
拉瑟福德先生，有小鸟告诉我
Mr. Rutherford, a little birdie told me

680
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:56,942
你对等离子注射器进行了相当有启发性的更新。
you made some pretty inspired updates to the plasma injectors.

681
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:58,552
是米格利莫博士吗？
Was it Dr. Migleemo?

682
00:30:58,682 --> 00:31:00,510
是的，是的。继续保持良好的工作。
Yes, it was. Keep up the good work.

683
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:01,947
- 好的。- 星际舰队想让我们
- Okey dokey. - Starfleet wants us

684
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:05,254
去看看在斯尼克米克5号上的一些会说话的胶状物。
to check out some talking goo on Snickmik 5.

685
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:06,734
那胶状物的粘度是多少？
What viscosity is the goo?

686
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,344
哦，它有什么好说的吗？
Ooh, does it have anything nice to say?

687
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:09,650
让我们找出来。
Let's find out.

688
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,217
舰长，请让我们出发。
Helm, take us out.

689
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:24,143
嘿，杰克。呃，我是说，舰长。
Hey, Jack. Uh, I mean, Captain.

690
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:25,709
这会成为一个问题吗？
Is this gonna be a problem?

691
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,537
不，你是塞里托斯坚强的。
Nah, you're Cerritos strong.

692
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,148
博伊姆勒，跟我们聚在一起。
Boimler, huddle up with us.

693
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:31,890
聚在一起？哦，不，我们不做教练对话。
Huddle up? Oh, no, we're not doing coach talk.

694
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,979
我需要一个执行官。
I need a first officer.

695
00:31:34,153 --> 00:31:36,720
[倒吸气] 但我只是一个初级中尉。
[gasps] Bu-- uh, but I'm only a lieutenant JG.

696
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,592
[轻声笑] 我知道你还没有完全准备好，
[chuckles] I know you're not quite ready,

697
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:40,942
但你们俩有机会让它成功
but the two of you have a chance of making it work

698
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:42,813
作为临时执行官。
as provisional first officers.

699
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,119
什么？
What?

700
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,078
- 那不算事。 - 现在算了。
- That's not a thing. - It is now.

701
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:47,818
我可能最终会提升你们中的一个。
I might eventually promote one of you.

702
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:50,125
- 把它当作一个比赛。 - 请不要这样做。
- Think of it as a contest. - Please don't do this.

703
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:51,474
这会破坏我们的友谊。
It will mess up our friendship.

704
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:52,736
嗯，一点人际冲突
Eh, a little interpersonal conflict's

705
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:53,912
是学习的最佳方式。
the best way to learn.

706
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:55,783
- 自从什么时候？ - 先生，但我，我不能。
- Since when? - Sir, but I-I can't.

707
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,567
我不——我们还是低甲板。
I don't-- we're still lower decks.

708
00:31:57,741 --> 00:31:59,656
不，你负责低甲板。
No, you're in charge of the lower decks.

709
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:00,919
找个座位。
Grab a seat.

710
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,268
[呜咽] 哦，天啊。
[whimpers] Oh, man.

711
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:04,139
[呻吟]
[groans]

712
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:15,194
兰萨姆：哦，
RANSOM: Oh,

713
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:16,282
我得想出一个酷炫的东西
I got to figure out a cool thing

714
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:17,848
在我们进入曲速时说。
to say when we go to warp.

715
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,850
我——我觉得这会自然发生，随着时间的推移。
I-I think it'll happen naturally, over time.

716
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,678
是啊，你不想听起来像是强迫的。
Yeah, you don't want it to sound forced.

717
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:24,203
哦，我想到了一个。启动引擎。
Ooh, I got one. Engage the core.

718
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,639
- 呃，不。我不喜欢。 - 不，不。你敢
- Uh, no. I don't like it. - No, no. Don't you dare

719
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:27,728
- 在锻炼笑话上进入曲速。 - 不，我很抱歉，
- go to warp on a workout joke. - Nope, I'm sorry,

720
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,599
- 我喜欢。就这样。 - 兰萨姆，你比这更优秀。
- I like it. It's staying. - Ransom, you are better than this.

721
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,427
博伊姆勒：不，请不要让我们的生活变成这样，先生。
BOIMLER: No, please don't make this our lives, sir.

722
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,386
玛丽纳：来吧，你不想定下这个基调。
MARINER: Come on, you don't want to set that tone.

723
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,649
- 博伊姆勒：先生...... - 如果这是一个五年任务呢？
- BOIMLER: Sir... - What if this is a five-year mission?

724
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:37,216
- 兰萨姆：启动引擎！ - [玛丽纳和博伊姆勒呻吟]
- RANSOM: Engage the core! - [Mariner and Boimler groan]
