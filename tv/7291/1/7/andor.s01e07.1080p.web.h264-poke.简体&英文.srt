1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,700
难道你不愿意孤注一掷 真刀真枪地干出点名堂
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once to something real?

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,200
我们要偷什么
What would we be stealing?

尽量分散
I'd spread it out.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,910
打一枪换一个地方

所以你完全不抱希望是吗
So you think it's hopeless, do you?

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,370
自由 独立
Freedom? Independence?

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,200
我们就得逆来顺受 感激涕零
We should just submit and be thankful?

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,500
我像感激涕零的样子吗
Do I look thankful to you?

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,290
-下士 -听候命令

20
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,950
放心吧

去吧
Go.

22
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,790
开始搬
Let's go!

23
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,750
这是怎么回事
What is going on here?

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,750
我被困住了
I'm pinned down!

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,870
不
No!

26
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,120
抓紧了
Hang on!

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,870
我猜现在 你的前途一片暗淡吧
My assumption is, you have no prospect for the future.

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,370
我去联系哈尔洛叔叔
I'm calling Uncle Harlo.

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,870
好歹也是亲戚一场
I'm calling in the family favor.

30
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,790
你猜里面有多少钱

31
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,450
差不多一人四千万

32

-So no rebellion for you? -Oh, I'm a rebel. It's just, uh...

33
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,830
我反的是所有人

34
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,540

-He wouldn't do that. -I'm taking my cut.

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,080
我把事办完了
I did my job.

37
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,200
我想有个人也许能帮我
I found someone I think can help me.

38
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,370
我们已经岌岌可危了
We're vulnerable enough.

39
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,160
我们需要资金 而不是更多人手
We need funding, not more people.

40
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,540
别跟我说什么岌岌可危
Don't lecture me on vulnerability.

41

没人比我冒的风险更大

我怎么怠慢了
How am I trifling?

55

他这可是帮了我们一个大忙

你得记住 今天你不仅仅是代表自己

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,500
从细节能看出一切 希里尔
Everything says something, Syril.

64
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,370
我想让你明白 你总是不听
I've tried to make you understand that, you've resisted.

65
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,040
你从我的衣领能看出什么
What is it that you hear my collar saying?

66

我们早有准备

-他们是谁  -叛军

-说明你不够努力 -别这样跟我说话

革命是需要代价的

143
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,040
我告诉过你 我已经竭尽全力了
I told you, I'm doing everything I can.

144
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,870
你的"全力"似乎只是

145
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,620
找一个救星来取用你的家庭资金
bringing in a savior to access your family funds.

146
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,120
是你干的 对吗
It was you, wasn't it?

147

我向你解释过找外人的风险 但你似乎不以为然
I explained to you the risk of new faces, but you seemed to know better.

148

你知道你做了什么吗

我以为你是来说会议的事

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,370
-你说我们在建立一个网络 -我当时是怎么说的

154
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,080
这完全是另一回事
This is something else entirely.

155
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,750
"一旦开始就不可能回头"

156
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,250
你知道事情会怎么发展
You knew where this was going.

157
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,410
你心里很清楚

网络已经建成 开始运作
The network's been built. It's up.

160
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,750
不进则退
It grows or it dies.

161
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,540
我们已经等得够久了
We've waited long enough.

162

你明白这会导致什么后果吗

是时候面对后果了

正如我们所愿
We need it.

166
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,830
我们需要恐惧
We need the fear.

167
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,290
需要他们反应过度
-We need them to overreact.

168
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,580
你说什么疯话
-You can't be serious.

169
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,450
帝国在慢慢扼住我们的喉咙 而我们在渐渐麻木
The Empire has been choking us so slowly, we're starting not to notice.

170
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,330
是时候逼他们下狠手了
The time has come to force their hand.

171
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,830
人民会受苦
People will suffer.

172
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,040
这是计划的一部分
That's the plan.

你并不生我的气

接下来将不会有任何规则

如果你狠不下心
If you're not willing to risk your conscience,

177
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,200
那就投降放弃吧
then surrender and be done with it.

178
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,450
我们要竭尽所能搞到每一笔钱

186
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,450
只能走着瞧了 对不对
Well, we'll see, won't we?

187
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,080
我们不能躲一辈子
We can't hide forever.

188

人们都以为我们在开玩笑 但这是真的

280
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,040
-这么快 -对 第二天就来了
- That was fast. - Yeah, they came the next day.

281
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,580
赶走了普莫 霸占了酒店
Kicked out Pre-Mor, took over the hotel.

282
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,870
费里克斯正式被帝国接管了
Ferrix is under Imperial authority.

283
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,410
你不该回来
You shouldn't be here.

284
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,750
我是被人告发的
Someone turned me in.

285
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,790
你还不知道
You don't know?

286
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,410
知道什么
Know what?

287
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,410
-是蒂姆 -什么
- T-T-Timm. - What?

288
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,160
蒂姆·卡尔洛告发了你
Timm Karlo turned you in.

289
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,950
怪他也没用 他死了
No point in stewing over it, he's dead now.

290
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,370
企业兵追捕你的时候杀了他
The Corpos killed him when they were coming after you.

291
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,750
你是怎么知道的
How do you know all this?

292
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,080
大家都知道
Everyone knows it.

293
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,620
-比克丝早就知道  -不
-Bix knew about it? -No.

294
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,410
她想来警告你 蒂姆想拦住她
She was coming to warn you, and Timm was trying to stop her,

295
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,870
或者想抓她 我不确定
or to catch her, I don't know. I've... I've heard both.

296
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,870
说什么的都有
But you can't be here, Cass.

297
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,160
但你不能待在这里 卡斯

298
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,790
帝国的人要长期驻扎
The Imperials are here to stay.

299
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,790
这次他们不会走了
They're not going away this time.

300
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,120
一切都完了
It's all come undone.

301
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
我们不用担心这个
We won't have to worry about that.

302
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,120
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

303
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,080
我们要离开这里
We're getting out of here.

304
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,870
远走高飞
We're leaving.

305
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,910
去哪里
To go where?

306
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,410
想去哪里都行
Anywhere we want.

307
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,450
我走运了
I got lucky.

308
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,700
我有钱了
I scored.

309
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,580
我的信用点足够我们去任何地方
I've got enough credits to get us anywhere.

310
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,950
我们一起走
We're gonna clear out.

311
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,950
远离这个鬼地方
Leave this mess behind.

312
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,790
什么时候走
When d-d-do we go?

313
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,580
-今晚就走 -今晚
-We go tonight. -Tonight?

314
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,790
是啊 不行吗
Yeah, why not?

315
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,870
就我们三个 还需要什么
What do we need to take but the three of us?

316
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,450
离开这个又冷又湿的地方
Huh? Get out of the cold and damp.

317
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,200
找个温暖舒服的地方
Find somewhere warm and easy.

318
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,500
只要你一句话
I can make it happen.

319
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,080
现在一切都变了 妈妈
It's all gonna be different now, Ma.

320
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,500
怎么了
What's wrong?

321
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,830
这实在太突然了
Just such a lot to take in.

322
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,620
没人知道我在这里
No one knows I'm here.

323
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,580
我们简单收拾些东西 一走了之
We take what we can carry, and we disappear.

324
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,000
这可是天大的事 我太累了
It's just such a big idea, you know, I... I get so tired.

325
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,160
我不知道说什么了
You surprised me.

326
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,790
我怎么这么着急 大晚上的
What am I thinking? It's... It's late.

327
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,290
对 你需要休息
Yeah, yeah. You... You gotta rest.

328
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,040
我去找下比克丝 我们明天一早就走
I'll check up on Bix, and we'll pull out first thing in the morning.

329
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,330
-好吗  -明天一早
- All right? - F-F-First thing.

330
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,580
就这么办
Let's do that.

331
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
谢谢
Thank you.

332
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,330
抱歉 没有准备正餐
Sorry we're not having dinner.

333
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,870
这次待多久
How long are you staying?

334
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,830
我明天回钱德里拉
I'm back to Chandrila tomorrow.

335
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,620
我一整年没回去了
I haven't been home all year.

336
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,160
你没错过什么大事
You haven't missed much.

337
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,290
错过了你呀
I've missed you.

338
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,370
我去的时候 好像你总是不在
You always seem to be away when I'm there.

339
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,950
我可没那么难约 蒙
I'm not that hard to find, Mon.

340
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,950
你可是议员
Not for a Senator.

341
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,750
说得对
You're right.

342
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,950
-我这个朋友不够意思 -我不是那个意思
-I've been a poor friend. -No, that's not what I meant.

343
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,950
生活让我们各奔东西
Life takes us where it will.

344
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,080
这么多年来 你成就斐然
You've become all this. All these years.

345
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,370
我们都今非昔比了
We're both a long way from where we started.

346
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,580
我变了很多吗
Have I changed so much?

347
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,040
-我们都得适应变化 -有那么糟吗
-We've all had to adapt. -Is it that bad?

348
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,160
我可不敢想象住在这里 蒙
I just can't imagine living here, Mon.

349
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,080
这种生活
Like this.

350
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,080
在科洛桑
Coruscant.

351
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,620
无处可逃
No escape.

352
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,910
我体验了这里的生活 你每天的应酬
Just this glimpse of what it's like here, what you have to do.

353
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,870
有时候是有点挑战性
It can be challenging.

354
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,500
你应对得游刃有余
You carry it gracefully.

355
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,830
我能信任你吗 泰
Can I trust you, Tay?

356
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,660
看在我们昔日的情谊上 想听听我的真实想法吗
Can I call back our old kinship and share some truth with you?

357
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,750
母亲
Mother.

358
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,000
莉达
Leida.

359
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,250
-记得我女儿吗  -当然
-Do you remember my daughter? -Of course.

360
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,370
这位是泰·科尔马 妈妈的老朋友
This is Tay Kolma, one of my oldest friends.

361
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,620
您好
How do you do?

362
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,870
你们以前见过
You've met before.

363
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,620
在科尔马银行 你在家乡见过阿德琳和玛萨
Bank Of Kolma? You know Adrine and Marsa from back home.

364
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,540
是我姐妹
-My sisters. -Um, I'm not sure.

365
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,000
记不清了
It's been a long time, and you've certainly grown up.

366
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,330
时间太久了 你都长这么大了

367
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,700
大家都这么说
So everyone says.

368
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,620
我是银行家
Typical banker. No one pays me to be original.

369
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,250
说不出什么新鲜话
Oh. Father said I needed to ask you if I may be excused.

370
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,790
父亲说我想走要经得你的同意

371
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,910
好的
Yes.

372
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,910
你可以走了
You're excused.

373
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,330
很高兴见到你
- Lovely seeing you again.

374
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,370
是的
- Uh, yes.

375
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,330
玩得开心 妈妈
Have fun, Mother.

376
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,290
这是另一种挑战
Another part of the challenge.

377
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,330
正是叛逆的年纪
It's a difficult age.

378
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,160
我斟酌再三 才决定和你聊聊 泰
I've spent a great deal of time thinking about this conversation, Tay.

379
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,290
我想告诉你一件事
I want to tell you something

380
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:25,700
这件事全银河系只有三个人知道
that only three people in the galaxy know about.

381
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,750
为什么选择告诉我
Why would you want to do that?

382
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,950
因为我需要你的帮助
Because I need your help.

383
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,700
我希望我能相信你
And I'm hoping I can trust you.

384
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,250
是私人的还是政治的
Is this personal or political?

385
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,040
是政治
Political.

386
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,250
-那你最好考虑清楚 -为什么
-Then I'd suggest you hesitate. -Why?

387
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,660
就像我说的 我们都变了
Like I said, we've both changed.

388
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,790
我对帝国的态度不仅仅是厌倦
I've done more than grow weary of the Empire.

389
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,790
恐怕我的政治观点对你来说有点激进
I'm afraid you'd find my politics a bit strong for your taste.

390
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,620
你的世界与帝国有千丝万缕的联系
Your world is inescapably linked to the Empire.

391
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,620
你身边一直围绕着这些人
You're with these people all the time.

392
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,120
我不知道你是否意识到
I'm not sure you're aware how far afield

393
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
有些人的政治忠诚已经偏离了正轨
some of us have taken our political allegiances these days.

394
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,620
抱歉 我可能喝了太多 佩林的大使馆佳酿
Sorry, I think I've had too much of Perrin's Embassy punch.

395
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,160
喝吧
Drink up.

396
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,160
多喝点 泰 保持微笑
Drink up, Tay, and keep smiling

397
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:24,330
假装我们在愉快地谈论童年时光
as if we're having a happy chat about childhood days.

398
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,040
我不太明白你的意思
I'm not sure I understand.

399
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,160
你不懂
No, you don't.

400
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:37,250
你对我的看法和人们对我的评价 都很一致 不是吗
What you see, what people say about me, it's a clear picture, isn't it?

401
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,370
我是位彬彬有礼 时而优柔寡断的议员
I'm a polite, sometimes-indecisive Senator

402
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,870
她屡战屡败 试图保护分离主义改良派
who spends her days fighting and failing to protect Separatist do-gooders

403
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,500
阻止帝国权力过度扩张
and battle Empire overreach.

404
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,040
令人厌烦 正如你之前所说的
An irritation, as you so harshly put it.

405
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,790
-我惹你生气了… -不 你让我放心了
-I've made you angry, I... -No, no. You've set me free.

406
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,620
我想了一整天 能否向你倾诉
I've been wondering all day how I could be sure of confiding in you.

407
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,750
我不知道我们在谈论什么
I don't know what we're talking about.

408
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,250
那是个假象
It's a lie.

409
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:09,120
人们自以为了解的蒙·莫思马 是个假象
The Mon Mothma people think they know, it's a lie.

410
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,290
是投影
It's a projection.

411
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,410
是幌子
It's a front.

412
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,830
微笑
Smile.

413
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,870
我从帕尔帕廷身上学到的
I've learned from Palpatine.

414
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,500
我露出手里的石头 你就不会注意到脖子上的刀
I show you the stone in my hand, you miss the knife at your throat.

415
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,620
你把我说糊涂了 蒙
Where is this going, Mon?

416
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,830
总理大臣在我的分离派联合会议中 安插了亲信
The Grand Vizier has infiltrated my Separatist Coalition meetings.

417
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:41,410
我的司机是帝安局特务 汇报我的秘密人道主义项目
My driver is an ISB plant and reports on my secret humanitarian programs.

418
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,500
他们在监视我 这正合我意
They know they watch me, and I want that,

419
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,290
如果所有人都认为 我只是讨人厌
because as long as everyone thinks I'm an irritation,

420
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,000
他们就会忽视我真正在做的事
there's a good chance they'll miss what I'm really doing.

421
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,870
你到底在做什么
What are you really doing?

422
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,290
筹集资金
Raising money.

423
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,500
我要动用我的家庭帐户
I need to access my family accounts.

424
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,410
不久前
Until recently,

425
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,660
我还能随意动用我的家庭财产
I was able to dip in and out of my family fortune without concern.

426
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,450
现在情况变了
That's changed.

427
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,250
我需要帮助
I need help.

428
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,700
筹钱干什么
Raising money for what?

429
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,410
我在筹备一个钱德里拉慈善拓展项目
I'm forming a Chandrilan charitable outreach program.

430
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,580
我会请你担任主席
I'll ask you to be chairman.

431
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,910
需要你来科洛桑进行访问
It will involve visits here to Coruscant.

432
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,750
就像是又一件善意和无用的麻烦事
It will appear to be another of my benevolent and useless irritations.

433
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,410
我考虑过替代人选
I've explored the alternatives.

434
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
你是我的最佳选择
You're my best shot.

435
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,040
你还没回答我的问题
You haven't answered my question.

436
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,040
我不会回答
And I won't.

437
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,290
你也最好不要知道
You're better off not knowing.

438
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,540
否则你会发现我的政治观点 对你来说有点激进
Or perhaps, you'd find my politics a bit strong for your taste.

439
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,580
佩林要过来了
Perrin's on his way over.

440
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,080
他对此一无所知 他不值得信任
He knows none of this. He's not to be trusted.

441
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,080
微笑
Smile.

442
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,750
你们在这里啊
There you are.

443
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,790
在回忆学生时代
Reminiscing, are we? School days?

444
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,370
这么容易被你看透了
Are we that predictable?

445
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,120
-马上要开同学会了 -别提醒我
- There's a reunion coming up. - Oh, don't remind me.

446
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,450
她假装不在乎 但我们都了解她 对吧
She pretends not to care, but we both know better, don't we?

447
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,750
她一直都这样
It was ever thus.

448
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,120
我可以借用她一会吗  有几位客人要招呼一下
May I steal her back? There's a few guests that require special handling.

449
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,330
当然
Of course.

450
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,830
下次再聊
To be continued.

451
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,660
嘿
Hey.

452
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,950
卡斯
Cass?

453
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,700
嘿
Hey.

454
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,370
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

455
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,160
还记得你爸那次抓到我翻墙吗
Remember when your father caught me climbing over that wall?

456
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,910
这里是你最不该来的地方
This is the last place you should be.

457
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,870
我想那是他当时的原话
I think those were his exact words.

458
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,250
这里不安全
It's not safe here.

459
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,910
蒂姆
Timm?

460
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,620
我猜他以为我们又在一起了
I guess he thought you and I were back together.

461
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,410
他为什么会这样想
Why would he think that?

462
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,370
我比你更惊讶
You can't be as surprised as I was.

463
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,950
你这是怎么了
What happened to you?

464
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,620
我自己不小心摔的
I ran into a wall, like I do.

465
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,120
你得赶紧走 卡斯
You can't be here, Cass.

466
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,580
冲锋队抓不住我
Troopers won't catch me.

467
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,450
放心吧
Not here.

468
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,620
他们不需要
They won't have to.

469
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,040
有人会告发你
You'll be turned in.

470
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,080
-谁  -谁
-By who? -By who?

471
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,620
任何人
By anyone.

472
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,580
人家觉得这些都怪你
People blame you for what happened.

473
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,620
怪我
Blame me?

474
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,950
你杀了两个企业兵 回家躲着
You killed two Corpos and came home to hide.

475
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,290
害整个镇子陷入危险
Put the entire town at risk.

476
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,620
-现在到处是帝国兵 -都怪蒂姆多嘴
-Now there's Imperials on the street. -If Timm had kept his mouth shut.

477
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,790
怪这个 怪那个 怪你 怪我 怪蒂姆
If this, if that. If you, if me, if Timm.

478
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,160
我们刚刚完成你安排的交易…
We were doing a deal you...

479
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,080
你坑蒙拐骗 欠一屁股债 一走了之
You scam, you borrow, you lie, you disappear.

480
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,500
你的神经病男友想害死我 我却成了恶人
Your crazy boyfriend tries to get me killed, and I'm the villain?

481
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,410
你得离开这里 越远越好
You need to get as far away from here as you can.

482
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,330
嚯
Wow.

483
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,910
我会的
I will.

484
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,540
这就走
I am.

485
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,410
你再也不用为我烦心了
You won't have to worry about me anymore.

486
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,950
我需要知道那个人的情况
I need to know about the other guy.

487
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,450
那个买家 他是谁
The buyer, who is he?

488
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,540
-我不知道 -你在骗我
-I don't know. -You're lying.

489
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,370
我没有
I'm not.

490
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,870
是帕克介绍的 但他也不清楚
Paak introduced us, but swears he doesn't know either.

491
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,620
我只有通讯器 呼叫对方 等回复
I have a comm. I call. I wait.

492
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,160
有时他们会回应
Sometimes they respond.

493
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,120
他知道我的一切 为什么
He knew all about me. How?

494
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,410
我不知道
I... I don't know.

495
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,790
你说得对 他确实知道
And you're right, he did know.

496
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,290
他知道企业兵在抓你 不是我说的
He knew that the Corpos were on you. But not from me.

497
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,660
如果你再联系上他 告诉他我履行了约定
You ever talk to him again, tell him I held up my end of the deal,

498
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,500
他必须忘记我
and he needs to forget about me.

499
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,700
其他人也一样
And that goes for everybody.

500
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,290
这个我熟
I've done it before.

501
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,250
一万两千信用点
12,000 credits.

502
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,950
我欠的都在这里了
That's everything I owe.

503
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,370
赞 努尔基 布拉索 迪玛
Xan, Nurchi, Brasso, Deema.

504
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,620
一万二应该够了
Twelve should cover it.

505
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,330
小心点 卡斯
Be careful, Cass.

506
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,250
你也是
You too.

507
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,700
这和我们无关 卡斯
This is not our fight, Cass.

508
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,950
别担心 他们不会待着不走的
Don't worry. They won't be here long.

509
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,870
他们会抗着那愚蠢的旗帜离开
They're just gonna raise their silly flag and fly away.

510
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,500
共和国万岁
Long live the Republic!

511
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,700
解放费里克斯
Free Ferrix!

512
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,540
待在这里 不要走动
Don't move. Stay here.

513
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,330
大家冷静一点
Hey, guys! Calm down!

514
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,120
-这样只会让事情更糟 -立定
- You're only making things worse! - Halt!

515
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,790
向后转
Turn!

516
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,910
举枪
Ready arms!

517
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,160
玛尔瓦
M-M-Maarva.

518
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,080
他回来了
He's b-b-back.

519
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,500
我正准备去找你
I was coming to find you.

520
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,500
我回来了
Here I am.

521
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,870
你们没收拾行李
You haven't done much packing.

522
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,500
她说我们不能走
She says we can't go.

523
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,330
毕 安静
Bee. Quiet.

524
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,450
你怎么了
What is this?

525
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,660
我不走了
I'm not going.

526
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,950
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

527
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,200
我要留下
I'm staying.

528
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,120
可这里不安全
But it's... it's not safe.

529
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,080
我知道
I know all that.

530
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,750
我不能留在这里
I can't be here.

531
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,370
你自己说了 "一切都完了"
You said it yourself, "It's all come undone."

532
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,450
在里克斯路有个帝国兵营
There's an Imperial barracks on Rix Road.

533
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,910
祝他们好运
Good luck to them.

534
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,620
-你愿意活在阴影下  -哪里都一样
-You wanna live under that? -It's happening everywhere.

535
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,000
我们会找到一个还没被毁掉的地方
Well, we'll find a place they haven't ruined yet.

536
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,330
我已经找到了
I'm already there.

537
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,540
就在我的脑袋里
That place is in my head.

538
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,750
无论他们造多少兵营 他们永远找不到我
They can build as many barracks as they like, they'll never find me.

539
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,290
这里还有什么可留恋的
What's left to keep you here?

540
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,830
反抗
The Rebellion.

541
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,790
什么
What?

542
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,120
费里克斯躲藏得够久了
Ferrix has been hiding long enough.

543
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,370
现在你要挑战帝国了
So now you're taking on the Empire?

544
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,160
想笑就笑吧
Laugh if you want to.

545
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,250
我哪笑了 这太离谱了
Who's laughing? This is madness.

546
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,330
不 才不是
No, it's not.

547
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:57,250
早该这样 可能注定会失败 我太老了 已经不在乎了
It's overdue, and probably doomed, and I'm too old, and I don't care anymore.

548
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,160
13年来 每次走在里克斯路上
For 13 years, every time I walk down Rix Road,

549
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,870
我都在广场前掉头走开
I turn off before I get to the square.

550
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,040
我绕远路
I take the long way around

551
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,250
这样我就不用想起克莱姆被吊在那里
so I don't have to think about Clem hanging there.

552
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,450
昨天 我听说阿尔达尼被袭击了
Then yesterday, I heard about this attack at Aldhani.

553
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,040
你听说了吗
Have you heard about this?

554
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,160
怎么了
What about it?

555
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,660
毕给我播了新闻
Well, Bee played me the news.

556
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,790
你知道我说的事吗
Do you know what I'm talking about?

557
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,000
知道 阿尔达尼的驻防基地
Yeah, yeah, the garrison at Aldhani.

558
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,830
我听了新闻 穿上我最好的外套
I heard that, I put on my best coat,

559
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,870
我面带微笑地走过了广场
and I walked across the square with a smile on my face.

560
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:39,080
如果有英雄敢对抗整个帝国驻防基地
If there are heroes brave enough to take on a whole Imperial garrison,

561
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,120
我也有足够的勇气在这里坚持到底
I'm brave enough to stick it out here.

562
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,910
我不指望你能理解
I... I don't expect you to understand.

563
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,660
阿尔达尼只是场抢劫
Aldhani was just a robbery.

564
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,120
人们站起来了
People are standing up.

565
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,080
是啊 然后送了命
Yeah, and getting killed for it.

566
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
但我们必须做点什么
But there's work that will need doing.

567
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
是吗 做什么
Yeah? What is that?

568
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,700
不管需要做什么
Whatever it takes.

569
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,290
我一直在躺着等死
I've been lying around waiting to die long enough.

570
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,950
你赢不了他们 玛尔瓦
You can't beat them, Maarva.

571
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,700
逃跑了肯定赢不了
Not if I run away.

572
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,250
你有自己的路 卡斯 我并没有责备你
You have a different path, Cass, and I am not judging you.

573
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,120
你经历了那么多
Everything you've been through,

574
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,290
甚至一开始你就被夺走了一切
everything that was taken away from you before you even started?

575
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:28,580
带上你所有的钱 去过平静的生活吧
Take all the money you've found and go and find some peace.

576
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,250
我不可能平静
I won't have peace.

577
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,910
我会一直担心你
I'll be worried about you all the time.

578
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,790
那就是爱
That's just love.

579
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,870
你对它无能为力
Nothing you can do about that.

580
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,250
我爱你胜过一切
I've never loved anything the way I love you,

581
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,160
为你担心也胜过一切 但这一次…
and I've never fretted on anything more, but this time...

582
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,910
你不能留下 而我不能离开
you can't stay, and I can't go.

583
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,120
-我可以说话了吗  -不行
- C-C-Can I speak now? - No!

584
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,700
你懂了就说句话
Tell me you understand.

585
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,790
我不懂
I don't.

586
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,080
你会的 你会明白的
You will. You'll see.

587
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,290
还有一件事…
And just one more thing... Just...

588
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,910
别再找你妹妹了
Stop searching for your sister.

589
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,660
那是幻想
It's a fantasy.

590
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,370
克纳里星没有幸存者
There were no survivors on Kenari.

591
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,660
那里发生的事不是你的责任
What happened there was not your responsibility.

592
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,000
你那时还小
You were a child.

593
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,330
放手吧
Let it go.

594
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,290
我会回来的
I'm coming back.

595
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,450
你当然会
Of course you are.

596
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,620
另一种分析是通过比较拘留人数
The alternative analysis is that by comparing the detention numbers

597
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,620
和突击检查的频率
to the frequency of surprise inspections

598
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
发现我们的港口巡逻部队分配不足
we're under-allocating our harbor patrol units.

599
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,160
有三种理论 扬先生
So, three theories, Mr. Jung?

600
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,200
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

601
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,620
三种可能性解释了
Three possible explanations

602
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,450
为什么你没跟上邻近星区的步伐
for why you have failed to keep pace with your neighboring sectors.

603
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,080
-您说得对 -我说得对
-That's correct. -I'm correct?

604
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,080
感谢你的认可
Your approval is heartening.

605
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,200
期待您多指教 长官
Your guidance would be welcome, sir.

606
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,500
很好 全面审核所有通往 曼特尔兵站的超空间通道
Very well, let's have a full audit of all hyperspace lanes

607
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,830
明天这个时候把报告交给我
leading to Ord Mantell on my desk by this time tomorrow.

608
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,000
遵命
As you wish.

609
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,330
-布莱文先生 -长官
- Mr. Blevin. - Sir.

610
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,500
今天早上我感觉你似乎很急迫的样子
I sense something eager in you this morning.

611
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,410
我没看错吧
Am I mistaken?

612
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,790
不 长官 不得不说 您说得对
No, sir. And at risk of repetition, you are correct.

613
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,700
是好消息吗
Good news, is it?

614
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,750
恐怕不是
I'm afraid not.

615
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,080
我想对一位同事提出指控
I wish to lodge a charge against a fellow supervisor.

616
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,160
说
Proceed.

617
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,200
有人违反辖区条例
I believe our Sector Protocols,

618
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,330
无视帝安局行为准则
as described in the ISB Code Of Conduct,

619
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,950
她就是米罗监督官 其越权行为
are being violated by Supervisor Meero, and that this overreach,

620
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,290
早已受到过谴责 此举危及帝国安全
for which she was previously reprimanded, risks compromising Imperial safety

621
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,910
我对此无法保持沉默
to a degree that silence is no longer possible.

622
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,950
现在说这个合适吗
You think this forum appropriate?

623
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,950
合适
I do.

624
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,620
这是严重的指控
It's a serious charge.

625
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,000
相信您能理解事情的紧迫性
I believe you'll share my sense of urgency.

626
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,410
米罗监督官
Supervisor Meero,

627
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,370
你愿意公开自证你的操守吗
do you mind having your integrity ventilated in public?

628
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,750
当然 长官
No, sir.

629
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,200
布莱文监督官显然认为我的行为
Supervisor Blevin obviously finds my conduct a more interesting subject

630
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,870
比改进帝国综合安全更值得研究
than the advancement of Integrated Imperial Security.

631
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,370
他这么卖力 我很想听听他的见解
He's put a lot into it, I'm curious to hear his insights.

632
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,700
关于费里克斯 对吗
This is Ferrix, is it not?

633
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,120
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

634
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,080
你的辖区
Your sector.

635
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,080
发现了一部罕见的海军装备
There was an unusual piece of Naval equipment recovered.

636
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,870
米罗想要你的犯罪报告
Meero wanted your crime reports.

637
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,080
您认定她的请求不合流程
You determined her request was out of order

638
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,250
-并且违反了指挥链 -这不准确
- and in violation of the chain of command. - That's not accurate.

639
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,120
您建议我用数据佐证我的怀疑
You advised me to reinforce my suspicions with data

640
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,040
并在今后的工作中更加小心
and to be careful in my work going forward.

641
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
小心
Careful?

642
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,120
这就是你的辩护吗 你很"小心"
Is that your defense? You've been "careful"?

643
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,410
我很好奇在座有多少人
I'd be curious how many people at this table

644
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,870
会认为你很"小心" 因为你访问我们辖区的数据
will think it "careful" that you've found a way to access our sector data

645
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,200
却没有提交任何申请
without ever filing a request.

646
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,750
是真的吗 黛德拉
Is that true, Dedra?

647
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,120
是的
Yes.

648
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,830
我依据《帝国紧急法》 在阿尔达尼事件后
I used the Imperial Emergency Act in the wake of Aldhani

649
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,660
收集了多个辖区的数据 并未经过官方审批
to gather data across multiple sectors without official sanction.

650
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,450
但这是个错误的问题
But that is the wrong question.

651
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,950
我想知道在座是否有人相信 叛军在规划行动时
I'd like to know if anyone here believes the Rebellion plans its actions

652
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,700
会遵守我们人为划定的辖区边界
around the artificially constructed boundaries of our sectors.

653
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,120
这些辖区是帕塔加兹少校设立的
Major Partagaz created those sectors.

654
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,700
为了便于管理 而非让人把玩
As organizing principles, not personal playthings.

655
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,580
你认为叛军会在乎 我们在星图上画的线吗
Do you think the rebels care about the lines we draw on maps?

656
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,370
你认为我的规划 不再符合实际需求了吗
You think the relevance of my work has been supplanted?

657
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,370
体制不改变 就会灭亡
Systems either change or die.

658
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,200
长官
Sir.

659
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,950
你的论点呢
Thesis, please.

660
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,330
叛军正有目的 有组织地
There is a focused, organized rebel effort

661
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,500
窃取严格管控的帝国军事组件
to acquire highly-restricted Imperial military components.

662
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,450
你的证据呢
Your evidence?

663
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,790
通过调取原始的辖区犯罪报告
By accessing unfiltered Sector Crime Reports

664
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,750
我能证明我们被盗的机密设备
I can now prove a link between the theft of our most secret equipment

665
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,750
被分发给全银河系的叛军组织
and its distribution to rebel groups across the galaxy.

666
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,000
你可以提供可靠 可验证的数据吗
This is hard, verifiable data you are prepared to present?

667
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,580
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

668
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,120
我相信布莱文监督官 知道我已准备好一份文件
I believe Supervisor Blevin is aware I have a documented file ready to go.

669
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,040
我相信他今天早上的指控
I believe his accusations here this morning

670
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,080
更多是出于自我保护 而非所谓紧迫性
have more to do with self-preservation than any sense of urgency.

671
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,700
还有比不规矩的情报人员 更紧迫的问题吗
What's more urgent than a renegade intelligence officer?

672
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,620
如果在座的每个人 都像你一样不守规矩会怎样
Imagine if everyone in this room played as loose with the rules as you.

673
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,750
好建议 布莱文
Excellent suggestion, Blevin.

674
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,580
我在想 如果在座的每个人
I'm wondering where we'd be right now if everyone here

675
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,160
都像米罗监督官一样努力会怎样
showed the same endeavor as Supervisor Meero.

676
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,250
我得考虑一下
I'll have to think about that.

677
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,290
我决定暂时把莫拉纳星区 分配给米罗监督官
For the moment, I'm reassigning the Morlana sector to Supervisor Meero.

678
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,500
费里克斯是她重点关注的星球
Ferrix is of great interest to her

679
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,040
它显然让你过度分心了
and has clearly become a distraction for you.

680
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,200
我认为没有紧迫问题
I see no urgent problem, but, as always,

681
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,370
但我一向欣赏这种 发人深省的思想交流
I salute the provocative exchange of ideas.

682
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,870
格兰迪监督官 你要加快进度
Supervisor Grandi, you will accelerate your schedule.

683
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,790
扬 我期待明天你关于 曼特尔兵站的报告
Jung, I will expect your report on Ord Mantell tomorrow.

684
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,080
感谢大家的热烈讨论
Thank you all for the lively session.

685
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,910
黛德拉 你到我这里来一下
Dedra, if you'd walk with me a moment.

686
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,160
干得不错
Well-played.

687
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,830
谢谢 长官
Thank you, sir.

688
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,700
你要当心了
Watch your back.

689
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:04,950
尼亚莫斯

690
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,040
基夫
Keef.

691
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,750
基夫
Keef?

692
