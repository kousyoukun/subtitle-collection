1
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:03,166
Something's wrong on Two.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,625
Something's really wrong on Two.

3
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:06,333
Look at me.

4
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:09,041
It takes a week for one word
to get all the way up here.

5
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,541
You're panicking about something

6
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,791
that's happening
on the other side of the building!

7
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,791
You think they're listening?

8
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,083
Like you would know.

9
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,583
I know this.

10
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:19,791
They don't need to care.

11
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,625
All they need to do
is turn this floor on twice a day

12
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,750
and keep their numbers rolling.

13
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:25,875
<i>I need a loan.</i>

14
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,791
You have someone in mind.

15
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,000
It's not a long list.

16
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,750
And yet you're afraid to say who it is.

17
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,666
Davo Sculdun.

18
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,958
He is not a banker.

19
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,708
He's a thug.

20
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,583
Your breathing sounds weak.

21
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,333
The doctor was here yesterday.

22
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,750
You really don't know where he is?

23
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,291
New man on the floor!

24
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:48,875
Hold your positions!

25
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,500
I have a new idea.

26
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,375
<i>Anto Kreegyr.</i>

27
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,208
-I want you to meet him.
-Anto Kreegyr?

28
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,291
He's been probing
the Imperial power station at Spellhaus.

29
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,375
We've got a rebel pilot in custody.
One of Anto Kreegyr's group.

30
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,666
We don't think Kreegyr knows
he's gone missing yet.

31
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,000
What if we foul the ship?

32
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,958
Have the pilot found dead in the cockpit.

33
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,916
Make it so.
Top priority. Quickly and carefully.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,416
We leave no trace.

35
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,375
-What, you can't save him?
-There's nothing to save.

36
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,083
He's had a massive stroke.

37
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,833
What happened down on Two?

38
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,791
A man who was just released on Four
ended up back on Two the next day.

39
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,833
Word got out on the floor,
and then they killed them all.

40
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,458
No one's getting out, are they?

41
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,541
Not now.

42
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,375
Not after this.

43
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,750
We need to go tomorrow.

44
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,208
-Tomorrow?
-You heard me.

45
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,916
Go where?

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Anywhere.

47
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,625
It has to be tomorrow.

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,083
-Tomorrow.
-We can't wait.

49
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,625
We'll never have a better chance.

50
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,083
-You sound insane.
-No, listen to me.

51
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,291
They don't have enough guards,
and they know it.

52
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,500
They're afraid. Right now, they're afraid.

53
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,875
Afraid? Afraid of what?

54
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,458
They just killed a hundred men
to keep them quiet.

55
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,666
-What would you call that?
-I'd call that power.

56
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,291
Power? Power doesn't panic.

57
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,291
Five thousand men are about to find out
they're never leaving here alive.

58
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,375
Don't you think
that worries them upstairs?

59
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,333
Whatever we're making here,
it's clearly something they need.

60
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,541
They can't afford to be surprised again.

61
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,166
There'll never be less guards
than tomorrow. You know that.

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,250
On-Program.

63
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,916
Everyday we wait, they get stronger.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,416
-It might be wise to have a plan.
-We have a plan.

65
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,625
Oh, what? You and Birnok and Melshi?

66
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,250
You don't have time to be stupid!

67
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,333
Come on!

68
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,625
The plan works around
the new man coming down.

69
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,625
They'll replace Ulaf tomorrow.

70
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,083
That might not happen again
until it's too late.

71
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,750
I'd rather die trying to take them down
than die giving them what they want.

72
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,458
We won't have a better chance.

73
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,958
It has to be tomorrow.

74
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,583
Program.

75
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,000
<i>Home Blue,</i>
<i>proceed directly to your cell.</i>

76
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,166
Keef, where is he?

77
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,500
He's dead.

78
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,583
He didn't make it?

79
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,666
What happened?

80
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,333
He's dead. Can't you see that?

81
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,541
-Who was it?
-Ulaf, the old guy.

82
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,125
New man tomorrow.

83
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,583
What's going on?

84
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,291
Tell them.

85
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,625
Collapsed in the walk way.

86
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,166
-Tell them!
-Tell us what?

87
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,041
What happened?

88
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,375
A doctor came out.

89
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,000
He didn't do much, did he?

90
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,083
Kino?

91
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,333
<i>We will have immediate</i>
<i>facility compliance</i>

92
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,500
<i>or we will begin activating floors</i>
<i>without warning.</i>

93
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,583
Keef! Floor!

94
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,666
What's going on?

95
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,708
The doctor told us
what happened down on Two.

96
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,791
It's true, isn't it?

97
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,083
They fried the whole bridge.

98
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,375
It is worse than that.

99
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,625
-It's why.
-Louder.

100
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,541
He said they made a mistake,

101
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,791
and sent back a man
who'd just been released.

102
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,958
-They fried two shifts to keep it quiet.
-You heard him say this?

103
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,291
How would he know?

104
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,708
I don't believe it.

105
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,500
He's a doctor,
they would never tell...

106
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,375
No one is getting out!

107
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,250
It's true.

108
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,291
The rumors are true.

109
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,625
He said it's true.

110
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,041
They're not letting us go.

111
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,458
Ever.

112
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,875
We're gonna die here,

113
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,000
or in the next place.

114
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,250
So let's get out heads back in our cells,

115
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,791
and start figuring this out.

116
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,791
<i>Kreegyr's men took the bait.</i>

117
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,791
They're asking for a landing bay.

118
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,458
-They found it?
-They're towing it, sir.

119
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,833
"Pilot dead. Ship adrift.

120
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,500
"Port of origin unknown.

121
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:54,125
"Kafrene Rescue Salvage
reports unresponsive, GPE 7000.

122
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:58,750
"Operator appears to have frozen following
hydraulic failure on hyperspace re-entry."

123
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,083
It worked.

124
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,791
Now we hang back and wait.

125
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,500
-Suggestion, sir?
-Yes.

126
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,250
I don't think we should step away.

127
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,333
-Go on.
-We should do what we normally do.

128
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,750
Unidentified ship, dead pilot.
We'd want to take a look, wouldn't we?

129
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,583
Let's assume Kreegyr's watching.

130
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,750
The least suspicious thing to do
would be to take an interest.

131
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,625
That is exactly what we will do.

132
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,125
Listen up!

133
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,958
We are done with counting shifts.

134
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,375
There is only then and now.

135
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,166
There is only one way out.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,083
Play it how you want.

137
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,791
But I'm gonna assume I'm already dead,

138
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,000
and take it from there.

139
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,666
There's no sense
in warning the night shift.

140
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,250
They'll hear about it
one way or another soon enough.

141
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,375
Let's make it look good.

142
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,916
<i>New protocol announcement.</i>

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,041
<i>All skybridge transfers will be On-Program</i>
<i>and silent until further notice.</i>

144
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,125
<i>Any shift not in full compliance</i>
<i>will be punished collectively.</i>

145
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,583
<i>On-Program now.</i>

146
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,208
On-Program!

147
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,125
And turn.

148
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,250
-Ready?
-Yeah.

149
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,916
Doctor Mullmoy,
we're just not sure what to do.

150
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:27,083
She needs her meds, she knows it,
but we caught her hiding them now,

151
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,333
and when I asked her
what she thought she was up to

152
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,250
she said your pills put her off of food,

153
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,000
and she'd rather keep eating
than let you keep pretending.

154
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,500
Okay, where is she?

155
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,000
-It's over there.
-Got it. Thanks.

156
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,916
I was here once, 30 years ago.

157
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,333
I'd just left Chandrila,

158
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,083
and my boss at the time
thought I'd enjoy seeing it.

159
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,375
Has it changed much?

160
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,083
I can't tell.

161
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,500
Didn't pay enough attention.

162
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,666
Suppose I thought
I'd be coming back regularly.

163
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,000
It's State property.

164
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,916
The rules are strict on décor.
Our choices for change are limited.

165
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a bit old, isn't it?

166
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,791
I like new.

167
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,291
I know it's tasteless and cliché,

168
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:19,541
but one of the indulgences of great wealth
is freedom from other people's opinions.

169
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,875
You've made your point.

170
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes, everyone says you're very direct.

171
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,333
The Senator has many obligations,

172
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,750
she's learned to manage
her time accordingly.

173
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,333
I like when things are clear.

174
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:36,833
But then I always get to thinking,
what's around the corner?

175
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,416
Mmm, your curiosity
has clearly been profitable.

176
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,750
I've met your husband several times.

177
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,833
I'm sure.

178
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,625
I take it that's not a corner
we're turning in this conversation.

179
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,083
It is not.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,750
Many cultures don't fully appreciate
the clarity of the Chandrilan marriage.

181
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,958
Even our own people are confused at times.

182
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,458
Boundaries can be liberating.

183
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,958
The old ways have value.

184
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:03,958
Good.

185
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,291
We understand each other.

186
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,791
So, searching for a more
fluid banking situation, are we?

187
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,083
We've discussed all this, Davo.

188
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,541
I'd like to hear her say it.

189
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,041
Yes.

190
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:25,291
We're exploring alternative
financing arrangements for our foundation.

191
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,666
As Tay has no doubt
already told you,

192
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,750
we've reached a scale in our holdings

193
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,041
that permits
a great variety of transactions

194
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:37,791
to be bundled in ways
that make outside observation impossible.

195
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,500
Yes, I've been informed.

196
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:44,125
What's unfortunate
is that people such as yourself,

197
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,166
those with immaculate reputations,

198
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,208
sometimes feel that by taking advantage
of the opportunity

199
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,125
they're somehow tarnished.

200
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,458
The money is yours.

201
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,958
Family wealth is a thing to be proud of

202
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,708
and you ought to be able to move it
as you like with your privacy intact.

203
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:03,875
The Empire's new regulations, made without
Senate consultation, I might add,

204
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,625
are as cumbersome as they are avoidable.

205
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,541
They've made a game of it and we play.

206
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,166
This is a charitable fund
we're establishing.

207
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,291
So I've been told.

208
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,041
-What will it cost?
-My fee?

209
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,833
We assume it's a percentage
of funds transferred.

210
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,166
I want no fee.

211
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,583
Money means very little to me
at this point.

212
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,208
Charity, isn't it?

213
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,916
-I insist.
-And I refuse.

214
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,041
Please take no offense,
I'd prefer not to owe any favors.

215
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,583
I'd feel far more comfortable
paying you for your trouble.

216
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,833
A drop of discomfort
may be the price of doing business.

217
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,750
Let's have it.

218
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,000
I'd like a return invitation.

219
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,500
I'd like to come back here at least once.

220
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,875
I'm sure that's something
that can be arranged.

221
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,833
I have a 14-year-old son.

222
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,458
I'd like to bring him with me.

223
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,625
You can't be serious.

224
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,416
-I'm not asking for betrothal.
-Then what are we talking about?

225
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,833
An introduction.

226
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,291
Your daughter is 13.
She'll soon come of age.

227
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,958
Two young people.

228
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,666
Attractive and privileged
Chandrilan citizens.

229
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:26,083
What makes you think
I approve of that tradition?

230
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:31,500
Our position sometimes makes decisions
for us, don't you find, Senator?

231
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:35,250
Neither of us have lived a life
that encourages nonconformity.

232
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,958
Is that your only offer?

233
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
I'm afraid so.

234
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,833
Tay will see you out.

235
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,791
Of course.

236
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,458
-It's a lot to think about.
-I'm not thinking about it.

237
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,083
That's the first untrue thing you've said.

238
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,125
It's been a pleasure.

239
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,416
There was a mark on the fountain.

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Could be anything.

241
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,166
That's what I thought,
so I went to the stairs.

242
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,125
The rail was gone.

243
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,541
A clean break. Fresh.

244
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,041
He wants a meeting, face to face.

245
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,208
There goes the day.

246
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,333
I don't like it.

247
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,000
Not now, I don't like the timing.

248
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,333
You don't like anything.

249
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,541
At the very least
you need to let me go.

250
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,083
Take the Fondor, go to safety
and I'll take care of it.

251
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,958
You know that's not happening.

252
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,416
Stop wasting time.

253
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,833
It's been a year.

254
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,583
I'm surprised he waited this long.

255
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,208
Then if it's a trap?

256
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, if it's a trap, we've already lost.

257
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,333
Hands away.

258
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,083
Are we really doing this?

259
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,625
-You're still on board?
-I want out. Don't care how.

260
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm dead. I'm dead.

261
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,791
-Hey, hey, hey!
-I'm pretending to be dead.

262
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,333
Don't die until you put up a fight.

263
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,500
One way out.

264
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,666
Come on!

265
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,666
Keep it moving!

266
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,208
Come on!

267
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,041
Pick it up.

268
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,500
Right now, I'm two racks behind!

269
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:51,208
And we are not
gonna close out the shift like that!

270
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,500
Stop right there.

271
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,583
On-Program. Hands on your head.
Eyes front. Feet down.

272
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,458
Keep it moving!

273
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,500
Come on, come on.

274
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,875
Come on!

275
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,125
Step forward, move, stop there.

276
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,250
Zap-rod.

277
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,625
If I have to use this,
you'll remember it, yes? Yes?

278
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,333
We owe a check on Three.

279
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,083
-Do that now.
-We're already behind.

280
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,041
-Stepping off.
-You're good.

281
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,083
I said eyes front.

282
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,208
Where is he?

283
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,333
-Are they even watching?
-Calm down.

284
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,750
-How?
-I thought you were dead already.

285
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,208
New man ready on 5-2-D,
requesting unit override.

286
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,625
How's it looking out there?

287
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,375
<i>Copy that, coming up.</i>

288
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,208
Looks good.

289
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,375
Okay, go.

290
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, no.

291
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,041
<i>On-Program.</i>

292
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,000
<i>On-Program.</i>

293
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,500
<i>New man on the floor.</i>
<i>Everyone hold positions.</i>

294
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,291
New man on the floor!

295
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,083
Hold your positions!

296
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,625
Lift engaged.

297
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,458
-What'd you say to me?
-I said nothing.

298
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,708
If you wanna say something,
you should say it now.

299
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,000
You start...

300
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,625
Hey! You lot, back on program!

301
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,583
You lot, back on program!

302
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,625
Get back on program!

303
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,125
Whoa, what's going on? What's that?

304
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,541
Now!

305
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,000
What's going on out there?

306
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,791
Go! Go!

307
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,958
-Clear the target.
-What are you doing?

308
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,083
-Come on! Help them!
-Let's go!

309
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,666
Attack!

310
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,666
Spark the floor! Spark the floor!

311
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,291
Get on the tables!

312
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,875
Get on the tables! Get up on the tables!

313
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,000
Spark the floor!

314
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,458
Talk to me!

315
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,333
Right, are you all right?

316
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,750
-You all right? You good?
-I'm okay.

317
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,041
Attack!

318
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,208
We have a situation on 5-2-D.

319
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,125
Repeat, we have a situation...

320
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,958
No! Xaul!

321
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,208
Come on!

322
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,375
Hey!

323
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,333
They're down!

324
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,458
Come on! Climb!

325
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,958
We're in!

326
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,125
Right.

327
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,708
Gimme a hand.

328
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,083
That's it. Go.

329
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,375
Got it.

330
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,291
-Hey, did you see that?
-Yeah, hold up.

331
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,416
What's that?

332
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,958
Where's that coming from?

333
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,708
Hand it off.

334
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:13,916
Move!

335
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,958
-Kino, come on!
-We need to hold the level!

336
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,708
-Let someone else do that.
-Go! Go!

337
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:21,916
Blow the consoles!

338
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,291
Keep the doors open!

339
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,916
<i>-What's going on down there?</i>
-I'm not sure, Sir...

340
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,500
<i>I'm looking at a water break.</i>

341
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,416
I've got service warnings on every panel.

342
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,458
<i>Get over there</i>
<i>and check it out. Now.</i>

343
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,750
Check out 5-2-D. Now!

344
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,625
Let's go. Okay.

345
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,791
Go, go.

346
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,666
-Jemboc!
-Taga, come on, let's go!

347
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,416
Let's go!

348
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:54,541
Let's go. Fall in. Come on.

349
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,916
Go! Go! Go!

350
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,916
One way out!

351
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,166
Come and fight!

352
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,541
What?

353
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,083
Come on.

354
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,958
-Ah!
-We're leaving! Join us!

355
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,625
Climb! Use whatever you can!

356
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,250
Go!

357
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:07,250
<i>This is a facility-wide</i>
<i>emergency announcement.</i>

358
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:11,125
<i>Complete program protocol</i>
<i>will commence in 40 seconds.</i>

359
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:15,333
Any deviation or failure to comply
will result in unit-wide activation.

360
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,583
-Start the count.
-Count engaged.

361
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,583
How much longer
to find the water break?

362
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,250
Techs waiting for a secure floor.

363
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,500
Isolate Five.

364
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,625
Locked in.

365
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:27,125
5-5, 5-3, 5-6. Burn a firewall around it.

366
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,375
Fry the whole Level.
Make the epicenter 5-2.

367
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,458
Too late.

368
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,166
-There's nobody there.
-You shouldn't be here.

369
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,208
-Turn it off.
-Excuse me?

370
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,458
Turn it off!

371
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,208
That could mean so many things.

372
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,916
I... I'll turn it off.

373
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:47,666
Step away.

374
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,666
Now!

375
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,958
-Shut down the floors. Everywhere.
-Do it.

376
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:57,791
No.

377
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,833
Don't just turn it off.

378
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,083
Cut the power.

379
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,583
It's all hydro.

380
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:06,833
Once we turn it off it takes months
to get it back up and running ag...

381
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,125
I don't have it.

382
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,583
He has the Hydro Gens.

383
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,416
That's the backup power supply.

384
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,208
Get out of there.

385
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:50,875
There.

386
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:57,625
With him.

387
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,458
Move!

388
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,708
On-Program! Now!

389
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,416
All yours.

390
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,458
Kino.

391
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,000
Tell them what to do.

392
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,083
It has to be you.

393
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,208
Come on, Kino.

394
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,750
You do this every day.

395
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,625
Tell them what to do.

396
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,500
My name is Kino Loy.

397
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,958
<i>I'm the day shift manager on Level Five.</i>

398
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,625
<i>I'm speaking to you</i>
<i>from the command center on Level Eight.</i>

399
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,750
We are, at this moment,
in control of the facility.

400
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,458
Is that the best you got?

401
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:21,458
How long we hang on, how far we get,

402
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:26,958
how many of us make it out,
all of that is now up to us.

403
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:32,500
We have deactivated
every floor in the facility.

404
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,958
<i>All floors are cold.</i>

405
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,458
<i>Wherever you are right now,</i>
<i>get up, stop the work.</i>

406
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:50,625
<i>Get out of your cells,</i>
<i>take charge and start climbing.</i>

407
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:54,875
<i>They don't have enough guards</i>
<i>and they know it.</i>

408
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,625
<i>If we wait until they figure that out,</i>

409
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,750
it'll be too late.

410
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:04,166
We will never have
a better chance than this

411
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:10,291
and "I would rather die
trying to take them down

412
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:12,916
"than giving them what they want."

413
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:20,125
We know they fried
a hundred men on Level Two.

414
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:26,041
We know that they are making up
our sentences as we go along.

415
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:30,666
<i>We know that no one outside here</i>
<i>knows what's happening.</i>

416
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:35,708
<i>And now we know,</i>
<i>that when they say we are being released,</i>

417
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:39,916
we are being transferred
to some other prison

418
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,541
to go and die and that ends today!

419
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,708
There is one way out.

420
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:54,583
Right now, the building is ours.

421
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,333
You need to run, climb, kill!

422
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,958
<i>You need to help each other.</i>

423
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,208
<i>You see someone who's confused,</i>
<i>someone who is lost,</i>

424
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,250
you get them moving
and you keep them moving

425
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,416
until we put this place behind us.

426
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,666
<i>There are 5,000 of us.</i>

427
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:22,208
<i>If we can fight half as hard</i>
<i>as we've been working,</i>

428
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,708
<i>we will be home in no time.</i>

429
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:27,833
<i>One way out!</i>

430
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,500
<i>One way out!</i>

431
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:33,791
One way out!

432
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:38,416
-One way out!
-One way out! One way out!

433
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,916
One way out!
One way out! One way out...

434
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Come on!

435
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,375
Let's get out of here!

436
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,166
Quiet.

437
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:19,166
One way out!

438
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:24,250
Whatever happens now, we made it!

439
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,375
What's wrong?

440
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,416
Can't swim.

441
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,333
-What?
-What did he say?

442
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,333
I can't swim!

443
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:04,000
<i>If this is a trap,</i>
<i>press the buttons for 215.</i>

444
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:08,625
<i>We'll have privacy.</i>

445
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:09,916
<i>We're running express.</i>

446
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,625
<i>First of all, congratulations.</i>

447
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,166
-On what?
<i>-Your daughter.</i>

448
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,250
<i>Healthy. Beautiful. You must be pleased.</i>

449
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,250
Is that meant to scare me?

450
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,166
<i>Well, it's been a year</i>
<i>since we've had a chance to catch up.</i>

451
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,500
<i>You've become a father.</i>

452
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,416
<i>-It's not worth mentioning?</i>
-It's not fair.

453
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,416
You knowing.

454
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,625
Watching me.

455
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,875
Do you ever think
how it might feel from my side?

456
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:45,041
<i>I think about you constantly.</i>

457
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,625
<i>Why are we here tonight, Lonni?</i>

458
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,708
There's a new supervisor rising.

459
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:54,083
Dedra Meero.

460
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:57,291
She's focused
on a suspect she's calling Axis.

461
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,958
She thinks he's building a rebel network.

462
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:03,500
She started looking
into stolen Imperial Naval equipment

463
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:07,041
and now she's looking
for a link to Aldhani.

464
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:09,708
<i>Dedra Meero.</i>

465
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,916
There was an incident on Ferrix
a few months ago.

466
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,083
She thinks there's a link.
She's been tearing the place apart.

467
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:21,875
They're searching
for a thief and the middleman.

468
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,916
<i>Huh. "Axis."</i>

469
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,625
She's gathering interest.
Partagaz likes her.

470
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:28,041
<i>Well, this is good.</i>

471
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,416
<i>Encourage this.</i>

472
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,666
Why is this good?

473
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,666
<i>Because she's wasting time.</i>

474
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,458
You had nothing to do with Aldhani?

475
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:42,250
<i>Well, almost nothing.</i>
<i>We were invited, but declined.</i>

476
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,166
<i>They got lucky. We don't build on luck.</i>

477
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,208
<i>But this can't be why you're here.</i>

478
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,083
She just captured a Rebel pilot
running supplies for Anto Kreegyr.

479
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:00,875
They turned him immediately
and staged an accident.

480
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,750
We know that there's a raid planned
on the power station at Spellhaus.

481
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,833
If Kreegyr attacks, they'll be waiting.

482
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:11,750
<i>And if he doesn't,</i>
<i>they'll know something's amiss.</i>

483
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,375
They'll be slaughtered.

484
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:14,666
<i>It's 50 men.</i>

485
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:17,791
<i>-You're worth more than that.</i>
-You have to warn them.

486
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,000
<i>To what end?</i>

487
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,416
<i>Ruin everything?</i>

488
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,416
<i>What better way to reassure the ISB</i>

489
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,208
<i>there's no leak in security</i>
<i>than sacrificing Kreegyr.</i>

490
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:30,166
<i>I'm doing this for you</i>
<i>as much as anything.</i>

491
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,000
Tell me
why we're really here today, Lonni?

492
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,625
I can't do this anymore.

493
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,583
I'm a father now.

494
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,333
I had no idea how it would feel.

495
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,791
We took a vow.

496
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:08,458
I'm giving you Dedra Meero.

497
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,750
I'm giving you Spellhaus.

498
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:14,333
I'm warning you about Ferrix.
I'm honoring my vow.

499
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,333
I've been working my way
through there for six years.

500
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,666
Working my way up.

501
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:21,750
Alone.

502
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,250
So, what was your plan?

503
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,875
Gather a big basket of goodies for me
as a farewell gift?

504
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,708
What were you planning to tell the ISB?

505
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,333
My health.

506
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,833
My wife's family has an import business.

507
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:48,083
Even as you say the words,
you know it's impossible.

508
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,958
We can't let you go, Lonni.

509
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,250
We can't spare you.

510
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,500
We've been grooming you for too long.

511
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:56,125
And yes, you've been alone,

512
00:35:57,166 --> 00:36:00,833
but your career has profited greatly
from information that we've provided.

513
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,708
Information that cost me dearly.

514
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,166
You love your daughter.

515
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:10,000
Kreegyr's men will be dying
to make sure she has a father.

516
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,666
You're trapped, Lonni.

517
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:16,625
There's no pleasure in saying it
but you're going nowhere.

518
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:19,958
My sacrifice?

519
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,291
It means nothing to you, does it?

520
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,833
I said I think of you constantly and I do.

521
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:32,916
Your investment in the Rebellion is epic.

522
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,500
A double life? Every day a performance?

523
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,500
The stress of that?

524
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,750
We need heroes, Lonni, and here you are.

525
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,958
And what do you sacrifice?

526
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,583
Calm.

527
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,416
Kindness. Kinship.

528
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:01,666
Love.

529
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:06,333
I've given up all chance at inner peace.

530
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:08,416
I've made my mind a sunless space.

531
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,791
I share my dreams with ghosts.

532
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,791
I wake up every day
to an equation I wrote 15 years ago

533
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:21,875
from which there's only one conclusion,
I'm damned for what I do.

534
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,958
My anger, my ego,
my unwillingness to yield,

535
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,875
my eagerness to fight,

536
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,416
they've set me on a path
from which there is no escape.

537
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:34,500
I yearned to be a savior against injustice
without contemplating the cost

538
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,041
and by the time I looked down

539
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:38,666
there was no longer
any ground beneath my feet.

540
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,791
What is my sacrifice?

541
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,750
I'm condemned to use
the tools of my enemy to defeat them.

542
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,416
I burn my decency
for someone else's future.

543
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,583
I burn my life to make a sunrise
that I know I'll never see.

544
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:58,583
And the ego that started this fight
will never have a mirror

545
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:01,833
or an audience or the light of gratitude.

546
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,750
So what do I sacrifice?

547
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,416
Everything!

548
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:17,666
You'll stay with me, Lonni.

549
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,666
I need all the heroes I can get.
