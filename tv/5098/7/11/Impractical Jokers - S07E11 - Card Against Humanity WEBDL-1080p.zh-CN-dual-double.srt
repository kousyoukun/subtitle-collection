<i>Coming up! Why is Sal giving
out some TLC?</i>

1
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:12,431
即将到来！为什么 Sal 会发放一些 TLC？

2
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:13,986
It looks like it's a little "Lopez".

2
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:13,986
看起来有点“洛佩兹”。

<i>What's got Q barking up the wrong tree?</i>

3
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,775
是什么让 Q 吠错了树？

4
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:20,111
No, no, no stay away,
stay away no no no!

4
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:20,111
不，不，远离，远离 No No No！

6
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:27,166
Ohhhh!

00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:27,166
哦！

7
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:30,025
Prepare for something amazing!

准备好迎接精彩瞬间吧！

Hey, mustache, what's up?

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,025
嘿，小胡子，怎么了？

9
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:35,267
I want my mommy!

9
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:35,267
我要我的妈妈！

10
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,994
I will never forgive you!

10
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,994
我永远不会原谅你！

11
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:41,431

11
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:41,431

Today, we're working at Raymond 
Opticians, and we're all working different jobs.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,986
今天，我们在 Raymond Opticians 工作，我们都在做不同的工作。

14
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,877
For instance, I'm the salesman.

14
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,877
例如，我是推销员。

15
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:51,721
I'm the receptionist.

15
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:51,721
我是接待员。

16
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:52,736
I'm the eye doctor.

16
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:52,736
我是眼科医生。

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,103
Somebody expecting a delivery?

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,103
有人期待送货吗？

18
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:55,713
We'll take turns assisting customers

18
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:55,713
我们将轮流协助客户

19
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:58,806
and as we do, we'll have to do and
say whatever the other guys tell us.

19
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:58,806
当我们这样做时，我们必须做和说其他人告诉我们的任何事情。

20
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:02,150
The catch is, at any time we can call
for another guy to take over the interaction.

20
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:02,150
问题是，我们可以随时要求另一个人来接管交互。

21
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,072
Whoever refuses the most, loses.

21
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,072
谁拒绝得最多，谁就输了。

22
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:05,376
[broken pieces shaking around]

22

[碎块四处晃动]

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,088
That's broken.

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,088
这坏了。

24
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:14,189
So, we all have a role today.

24
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:14,189
所以，我们今天都有责任。

25
00:01:14,214 --> 00:01:15,994
<i>And Joe's our receiptionist. You
ready, bub?</i> -Alright.

25
00:01:14,214 --> 00:01:15,994
而 Joe 是我们的收货人。你准备好了吗，小伙子？-好。

26
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,791
Here we go. I'm the "eye candy".

26
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,791
来吧。我是“养眼的”。

27
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,650
So this is like our version
of "hot potato".

27
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,650
所以这就像我们版本的“烫手山芋”。

28
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:22,502
We're just going to keep tossing
the situation to each other. -Right.

28
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:22,502
我们只是要继续把情况扔给彼此。-右。

29
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:25,642
and whoever gets the most thumbs down
in that situation, loses.

29
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:25,642
在这种情况下，谁得到最多的反对，谁就输了。

30
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:28,767
But you can also throw it to any one
of the other guys at any given time.

30
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:28,767
但你也可以在任何给定的时间把它扔给其他任何一个人。

31
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:31,266
This is a real "format buster".
-It is.

31
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:31,266
这是一个真正的 “格式破坏者”。-是的。

32
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:35,063
Hi, how are you?
-How you doing.

32
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:35,063

Just gotta check your I.D.
Make sure it's the same.

00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:26,942
Dr. Vulcano.

81
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:26,942
武尔卡诺博士。

82
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:27,942
Hi, doctor.

82
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:27,942
嗨，医生。

83
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:29,713
Brian said you got here a little early

83
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:29,713
Brian 说你来得有点早

84
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:32,228
because you needed to get in and out
right away and you wanted me to hurry?

84
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:32,228
因为你需要马上进出，你想让我快点？

85
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,142
No!

85
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,142
不！

86
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:34,713
No.

86
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:34,713
不。

87
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:38,002
I could ask him.

87
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:38,002
我可以问他。

88
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,158
Could we get Brian out here please?

88
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,158
我们能把 Brian 叫出来吗？

89
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:44,674
You're back in!

89
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:44,674
你回来了！

90
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:45,564
You ready?

90
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:45,564
准备好了吗？

91
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:48,010
Yeah, I'm ready in a sec. Hey Brian?
-Hey, doc. I've been looking for you.

91
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:48,010
是的，我马上就准备好了。嘿 Brian？-嘿，博士。我一直在找你。

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,517
Yeah, you had said to me that he
said--he demanded--I hurry up

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,517
是的，你对我说过，他说——他要求——我快点

93
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:56,478
It must have been I
just miscontrued. I...

93
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:56,478
一定是我只是误解了。我。。。

94
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,447
Are you ready?

94
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,447
准备好了吗？

95
00:03:57,472 --> 00:03:59,252
Yeah, I'm ready. <i>-Let's go.</i>
-Alright.

95
00:03:57,472 --> 00:03:59,252
是的，我准备好了。-我们走吧。-好。

96
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:02,135
Alright. So I'm out. You're in?
-Well, I tried all I could.

96
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:02,135
好。所以我出去了。你进来了？-嗯，我尽了我所能。

97
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:05,189
Come with me right
this way, David.

97
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:05,189
跟我走这边，大卫。

98
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:06,400
Well done, Q.

98
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:06,400
干得好，问。

99
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:09,408
Ophthalmologist.

99
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:09,408
眼科医生。

100
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,197
Sal, the first thing you gotta do is you
gotta measure this guy's height

100
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,197
Sal，你得做的第一件事就是测量这个家伙的身高

101
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:13,025
against the wall. Gotta see how tall he is.

101
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:13,025
靠墙。得看看他有多高。

102
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:17,619
Dave, Dave, before you sit:
Can I have you...

102
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:17,619
戴夫，戴夫，在你坐下之前：我能不能请你......

103
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:18,775
just step here?

103
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:18,775
就走到这里？

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,322
Just step... [stammers] uh, yeah.

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,322
只需一步...[结结巴巴地说]呃，是的。

105
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,932
Okay, perfect.

105
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,932
好的，完美。

106
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:28,970
Take a quick height.
Okay.

106
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:28,970
快速升高。好。

107
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:30,525
Next time you come in, we'll check.

107
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:30,525
下次您来时，我们会检查。

108
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:33,447
Just for next time you come in,
we'll see if you grew at all.

108
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:33,447
只是为了下次你进来，我们会看看你有没有成长。

109
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,392
The glasses that you're wearing now?

109
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,392
你现在戴的眼镜？

110
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,596
I have, honestly, I have no
idea what that means.

110
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,596
老实说，我不知道这意味着什么。

111
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:44,955
Minus 3? I honestly have no
idea what that means

111
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:44,955
负 3 分？老实说，我不知道这意味着什么

112
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,986
but we'll continue.

112
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,986
但我们会继续。

113
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:52,119
<i>[Q] Let me ask you a question.</i>
Let me ask you a quick question while I'm filling out...

113
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:52,119
[Q] 我问你一个问题。在我填写时，让我问你一个简短的问题......

114
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:53,767
Where's Hoffa buried?

114
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:53,767
霍法埋在哪里？

115
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,135
<i>[Joe] Jimmy Hoffa.</i>

115
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,135
[乔]吉米·霍法。

116
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:56,150
Nope.

116
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:56,150
不。

117
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:57,978
<i>[Murr] He said "nope".</i>

117
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:57,978
[喃喃自语]他说“没有”。

118
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,721
That's one thumbs down for you.

118
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,721
这对你来说是一个大拇指。

119
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,103
Just, uh, lean forward a little bit, David.

119
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,103
只是，呃，身体前倾一点，David。

120
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:05,814
Okay, and just...
keep your right eye open.

120
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:05,814
好吧，就......睁大右眼。

121
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,557
Man, you got really nice
shit-brown eyes.

121
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,557
伙计，你那双狗屎棕色的眼睛真漂亮。

122
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:13,736
Slate blue eyes, huh?
-You got it.

122
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:13,736
石板蓝的眼睛，是吧？-没问题。

123
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:18,002
That's two!

123
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:18,002
那是两个！

124
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,346
<i>[Murr] Two thumbs down.</i>

124
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,346
[喃喃自语]两个大拇指向下。

125
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,439
Sal, test his eyes by having
him follow your finger.

125
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,439
Sal，让他跟着你的手指试探一下他的眼睛。

126
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:24,830
Just follow my finger with
both eyes, okay?

126
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:24,830
就用双眼跟着我的手指走，好吗？

127
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,385
Okay, switch to your middle
real quickly in between.

127
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,385
好吧，在两者之间快速切换到你的中间位置。

128
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,096
Just follow my finger with
both eyes, okay?

128
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,096

好吧，在两者之间快速切换到你的中间位置。

130
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:42,986
Alright, keep it [unintelligible]

130
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:42,986
好了，别说 [看不懂]

131
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:46,369
He's... he's trying to ease into it.

131
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:46,369
他......他正在努力适应它。

132
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:48,557
Okay, and last one.

132
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:48,557
好的，最后一项。

133
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:51,760
<i>[Joe] Good job.</i>

Okay, so let's get on these peepers.
I'm going to lock this in right here.

135
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:57,799
好的，让我们开始这些窥视者。我将在这里锁定它。

136
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,877
Okay, that's good.

136
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,877
好吧，这很好。

137

Both eyes open please.

137
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:00,244
请睁开两只眼睛。

138
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:07,346
Your left eye, actually...

00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:56,424
<i>No joke.</i>

160
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:56,424
不是开玩笑。

161
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,548
I also went to Georgetown, but now
I'm delivering packages.

161
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,548
我也去了乔治城，但现在我正在送包裹。

162
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,439
I also, I went to Georgetown
University

162
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,439
我也去了乔治城大学

163
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,415
Now, I'm delivering
packages in Yonkers.

163
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,415
现在，我在扬克斯运送包裹。

164
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,712
Nothing wrong with it.

164
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,712
没什么问题。

165
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,978
[silence]

165
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,978
[沉默]

166
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:12,736
I left the cash with
the receptionist.

166
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:12,736
我把现金留给了接待员。

167
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:13,681
You could've given it to me.

167
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:13,681
你本可以把它给我的。

168
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:15,579
Okay, just...

168
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:15,579
好吧，就......

169
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:16,595
Okay, thank you.

169
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:16,595
好的，谢谢。

170
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,259
Okay, can we just...

170
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,259
好吧，我们能不能......

171
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:23,072
The last thing I gotta do with you
is I want you to read the chart.

171
00:07:20,697 --> 00:07:23,072
我要对你做的最后一件事是我希望你阅读图表。

172
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,290
[chucking] What's going on?

172
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,290
[咯咯]这是怎么回事？

173
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:26,001
G E F A L

173
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:26,001
G E F A L

174
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:28,314
Murr. He didn't give you enough
money. He shorted you a dollar.

174
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:28,314
穆尔。他没有给你足够的钱。他卖空了你一美元。

175
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:29,806
He shorted you a dollar!

175
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:29,806
他卖空了你一美元！

176
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:30,837
Son of a bitch!

176
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:30,837
狗娘养的！

177
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:31,572
No tip.

177
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:31,572
没有小费。

178
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:34,884
Can you read it... yes?

178
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:34,884
你能读懂吗...是的？

179
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,853
You shorted me a dollar,
and there's no tip.

179
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,853
你卖空了我一美元，而且没有小费。

180
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:38,025
I'm with, I'm with a patient...

180
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:38,025
我和病人在一起......

181
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:52,087
<i>I'm sorry. I left it with the
receptionist I just said.</i>

181
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:52,087
对不起。我把它留给了我刚才说的接待员。

182
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,103
Receptionist? Get in there.

182
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,103
接待员？进去。

183
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,103
<i>I left it with the receptionist!</i>

183
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,103
我把它留给了接待员！

184
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:57,587
<i>I gave you it!</i>

184
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:57,587
我给你的！

185
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:00,337
Sorry about the mix-up.

185
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:00,337
很抱歉搞混了。

186
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:02,462
No...

186
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:02,462
不。。。

187
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:08,564
He said I shorted you a dollar.

187
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:08,564
他说我卖空了你一块钱。

188
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:13,368
Give it to the delivery guy. I can't believe

188
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:13,368
把它交给送货员。我简直不敢相信

189
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,087
[overlapping arguments]

189
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,087
[重叠的论点]

190
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:17,032
David, get your things. You're fine.

190
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:17,032
大卫，拿你的东西。你没事。

191
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,798
You passed this with no problem, and I...

191
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,798
你顺利通过了这个，而我......

192
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:19,970
You'll get your pair...

192
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:19,970
你会得到你的一对......

193
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:21,439
Give him the Chinese food.

193
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:21,439
给他吃中餐。

194
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:24,329
Could you do me a favor? Will you have the
lunch, please? Take the lunch.

194
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:24,329
你能帮我一个忙吗？请问您能吃午饭吗？吃午饭。

195
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:25,736
Take the lunch, please.

195
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:25,736
请吃午饭。

196
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:29,884
<i>Well, that's, you're right. You're
right not to eat it.</i>

196
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:29,884
嗯，你说得对。你不吃它是对的。

197
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:31,579
I mean, whose was this?

197
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:31,579
我的意思是，这是谁的？

198
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:33,853
It's his.

198
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:33,853
这是他的。

199
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:35,822
It's my tip. It's my damn tip!
-Congratulations, buddy.

199
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:35,822
这是我的建议。这是我该死的小费！- 恭喜，伙计。

200
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:36,814
So, he lost.

200
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:36,814
所以，他输了。

201
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:37,814
What is this Chinese food?

201
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:37,814
这是什么中餐？

202
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,837
That's mine, bring it in.
-That's Murray's, bring it down. -Okay.

202
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,837
那是我的，把它带进来。-那是 Murray 的，把它下来。-好。

203
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:46,954
<i>Sal and Q failed this eye exam.
So they're first up on the loser board.</i>

203
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:46,954
Sal 和 Q 这次眼科检查没有通过。所以他们首先出现在失败者董事会上。

204
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,806
Today, we're taking turns recording
stranger's conversations in the park

204
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,806
今天，我们将轮流记录陌生人在公园里的对话

205
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,853
using this ridiculous device.

205
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,853
使用这个荒谬的设备。

206
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:56,178
When the person asks us <i>why</i>
they're being recorded

206
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:56,178
当此人问我们为什么他们被录音时

207
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,045
we'll have to give them an
explanation

207
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,045
我们得给他们一个解释

208
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,514
that has been given to us
by the other guys.

208
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,514
这是其他人给我们的。

209
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:04,209
If they ask you to stop recording
their conversation, you lose.

209
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:04,209
如果他们要求您停止录制他们的对话，您就输了。

210
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,350
WHAT!?

210
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,350
什么！？

211
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:07,748
You can't hear us?

211
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:07,748
您听不到我们的声音吗？

212
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:08,428
WHAT?

212
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:08,428
什么？

213
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:13,889
🎵 [sneaky spy music] 🎵

213
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:13,889
🎵 [偷偷摸摸的间谍音乐] 🎵

214
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:14,795
<i>[Q] There you go.</i>

214
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:14,795
[Q] 好了。

215
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,373
<i>[Joe] Here he comes.
He's on the sweep.</i>

215
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,373
[乔]他来了。他正在横扫。

216
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:22,308
Oh my god!

216
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:22,308
哦，我的上帝！

217
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:32,597
Just ignore. Just gettin' some audio.

217
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:32,597
就忽略。只是获取一些音频。

218
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:35,769
There have been reports of a pervert
in the area, and I'm trying to get evidence.

218
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:35,769
有报告称该地区有，我正在努力获取证据。

219
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,347
There was reports of a pervert
in the area

219
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,347
有报道称该地区有一名

220
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,293
so I'm just trying to
gather some evidence.

220
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,293
所以我只是想收集一些证据。

221
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,285
Is it you?

221
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,285
是你吗？

222
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,629
No no no no no no. I'm just
making sure it's not you.

222
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,629
不，不，不。我只是要确保不是你。

223
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,496
Well, it could, it could be me.

223
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,496
嗯，有可能，可能是我。

224
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,254
You were going "full perv"
before I got over here?

224
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,254
在我到这里之前，你就已经 “全副武装” 了吗？

225
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,738
They didn't give a report
on what the person looked like.

225
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,738
他们没有提供关于这个人长什么样的报告。

226
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:53,777
I would say...

226
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:53,777
我会说......

227
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,262
tall, dark, and handsome?

227
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,262
高大、黝黑、英俊？

228
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:58,605
So... would that be you, or...?

228
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:58,605
所以。。。那会是你，还是......？

229
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,457
Did you just call me tall, dark,
and handsome?

229
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,457
你刚才叫我高、黑、帅吗？

230
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:06,074
I'm, I'm Sal. I'm actually [unintelligible]

230
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:06,074
我是，我是 Sal。我实际上是 [无法理解]

231
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:07,293
I'm Valerie.
<i>-Hey Valerie.</i>

231
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:07,293
我是瓦莱丽。-嘿瓦莱丽。

232
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:09,277
I'm actually a celebrity. I'm
on television.

232
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:09,277
我实际上是个名人。我在电视上。

233
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:11,004
Yeah, I'm actually a celebrity.
I'm on television.

233
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:11,004
是的，我实际上是个名人。我在电视上。

234
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:13,293
Also, can I keep recording you?

234
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:13,293
另外，我可以继续记录你吗？

235
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:15,097
Also, could I keep recording you?
Is that alright?

235
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:15,097
另外，我可以继续记录你吗？没问题吗？

236
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,269
<i>[Murr] Here he is.
[Q] There he goes.</i>

236
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,269
[喃喃自语]他在这里。[Q] 他走了。

237
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:25,012
<i>[Murr] He's moving in.</i>

237
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:25,012
[喃喃自语]他要搬进来了。

238
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:30,191
Sorry, I didn't mean to, I
didn't mean to scare.

238
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:30,191
对不起，我不是故意的，我不是故意吓唬人的。

239
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:35,535
I noticed you stopped talking.

239
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:35,535
我注意到你不再说话了。

240
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:38,871
Could we get back to it?

240
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:38,871
我们能回到它吗？

241
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,996
Did you hear about Maureen
in accounting?

241
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,996
你听说过会计学的 Maureen 吗？

242
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,183
Trying to throw out topics.

242
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,183
试图抛出话题。

243
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,308
What, Maureen in accounting? No, you guys
just talk about Maureen. I just need some audio.

243
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,308
什么，会计学的莫琳？不，你们只是在谈论莫琳。我只需要一些音频。

244
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,043
<i>[Murr] I leave this playing for my kid.</i>

244
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,043
[喃喃自语]我把这个游戏留给我的孩子。

245
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,152
So he thinks he's not alone
at night when I sneak out.

245
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,152
所以他认为我偷偷溜出去的时候，他并不孤单。

246
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,746
I noticed you stopped talking.

246
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,746
我注意到你不再说话了。

247
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:05,980
Could we get back to it?

247
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:05,980
我们能回到它吗？

248
00:11:06,222 --> 00:11:07,144
I just need some audio.

248
00:11:06,222 --> 00:11:07,144
我只需要一些音频。

249
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:08,863
<i>[Murr] I leave this playing for my kid.</i>

[喃喃自语]我把这个游戏留给我的孩子。

250
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:10,988
So he thinks he's not alone
at night when I sneak out.

250
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:10,988
所以他认为我偷偷溜出去的时候，他并不孤单。

251
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:14,134
I leave these tapes playing for my
kids when I sneak out at night.

251
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:14,134
当我晚上偷偷溜出去时，我会让这些磁带给我的孩子们播放。

252
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:15,556
So they don't think they're alone.

252
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:15,556
所以他们并不认为自己是孤军奋战。

253
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,236
Laughter's good. They'll feel safe.

253
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,236
笑声很好。他们会感到安全。

254
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:21,525
You guys know
lullabies and ####?

254
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:21,525
你们知道摇篮曲和 ####？

255
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:24,736
Nothin'

255
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:24,736
什么都没有

257

[喃喃自语]乔，他们又在说话了。快跑回来！

258
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:39,509
It's cool that I
record this stuff, right?

258
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:39,509
我录制这些东西很酷，对吧？

259
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,697
I can use it for my children
at home when I sneak out?

259
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,697
偷偷溜出去的时候，我可以在家里给孩子用吗？

260
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:42,837
Not a problem.

260
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:42,837
没问题。

261
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:44,900
Ahhhhh!

261
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:44,900
啊啊！

<i>The check comes in the mail, yeah.
Absolutely.</i>

No check. This is for official

<i>These women have given
consent without needing payment.</i>

这些女性无需付款即可同意。

265
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,658
They are non-union.
Repeat. Non-union.

265
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,658
他们是非工会的。重复。非工会。

266
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:59,087
I also have the right to exploit
their voice with any means necessary

266

我也有权以任何必要的手段利用他们的声音

269
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:14,228
Ya know what it is, I'm recording.
I'm recording audio.

269
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:14,228
你知道这是什么，我在录音。我正在录制音频。

270
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:16,627
Look at the woman in purple.

270
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:16,627
看看那个穿紫色衣服的女人。

271
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,330
You can talk too, it's okay.

271
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,330
你也可以说话，没关系。

272
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:23,369
I need to record over a weird
thing I did on these tapes.

272
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:23,369
我需要把我在这些磁带上做的一件奇怪的事情记录下来。

273
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:27,603
I need to record over some, some,
some weird things I recorded on this tape.

273
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:27,603
我需要把我在这个磁带上录制的一些、一些、一些奇怪的东西记录下来。

274
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,681
Can you just talk to yourself,
because I can't be on...

274
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,681
你能不能自言自语，因为我不能在......

275
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:32,017
I'm sitting here, taking my lunch.
And uh...

275
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:32,017
我坐在这里，吃午饭。呃......

276
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,041
I remember when I was

276
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,041
我记得我当时

277
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,853
in Saint Davis summer workshop.
They had me

277
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,853
在圣戴维斯夏季研讨会。他们有我

278
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:41,541
talking. And I just kept talking, talking,
talking. So they filmed my mouth.

278
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:41,541
说话。我就不停地说话，说话，说话。所以他们拍了我的嘴。

279
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,087
And then they said, "Well, that girl has a
problem with talking too much."

279
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,087
然后他们说，“嗯，那个女孩说话太多有问题。

280
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:46,908
She's just narrating her life.

280
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:46,908
她只是在讲述她的生活。

281
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,314
You don't mind that I'm
recording the audio?

281
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,314
你不介意我在录制音频吗？

282
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:50,923
You don't mind? Oh, great, great.

282
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:50,923
你不介意吗？哦，太好了，太好了。

<i>[Joe] Oh, now he's just
rubbing it in our face.</i>

283

Yeah.
-This lady's the best.

285
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,189
是的。- 这位女士是最好的。

Oh, hello.

286
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:57,486

in the middle of Brooklyn.

可惜的是，我们现在在布鲁克林市中心的一个混凝土公园里。

[乔]因为我相信你心里有个鬼魂

296
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,806
and the only way to tell is through audio.

296

唯一的判断方法是通过音频。

I believe that there's a ghost inside of you.

我相信你内心有个鬼。

00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,572
and the only way to tell is through audio.
So just, go ahead.

298
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,572
唯一的判断方法是通过音频。所以，去吧。

299
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:38,541
No, no. I don't have
any ghost in me.

299
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:38,541
不 不。我身上没有任何鬼魂。

300
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:40,744
No no no, stay away.
-No, it's alright!

300
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:40,744
不不不，远离。- 不，没关系！

301
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:44,666
Don't get close.
You can stay over there.

301
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:44,666
不要靠近。你可以呆在那边。

302
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,791
It's okay. It's okay. Just keep going.
We'll get it out of you.

302
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,791
没关系。没关系。继续前进。我们会从你那里得到它。

303
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:48,916
We'll get it out of you.

303
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:48,916
我们会从你那里得到它。

304
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,400
I'm not speaking to you anymore.
I'm speaking to the ghost.

304
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,400
我不再和你说话了。我在和鬼魂说话。

305
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:52,595
I'm not ghost.

305
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:52,595
我不是鬼。

306
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,502
That's exactly what the ghost would say.

306
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,502
这正是鬼魂会说的。

307
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,439
I, I think you are
like a little crazy.

307
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,439
我，我觉得你有点疯狂。

308
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:58,853
I'm a little crazy?

308
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:58,853
我有点疯狂？

309
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:01,025
Nooo! What makes you
say I'm a little crazy?

309
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:01,025
不！你为什么说我有点疯狂？

310
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,673
Just because I'm dressed as a
bush in the middle of Brooklyn

310
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,673
就因为我打扮得像布鲁克林中央的灌木丛

311
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,431
talking to you about the
ghost inside of you?

311
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,431
和你谈论你内心的幽灵？

312
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:08,126
It's funny, but...
-Is it okay if I record you?

312
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:08,126
这很有趣，但是......-我可以录下你吗？

313
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:08,728
Yes!

313
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:08,728
是的！

314
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,806
Alright. Now "leaf" me alone.

314
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,806
好。现在 “叶子” 我一个人。

315

316
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,017
People love a good bush.

316
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,017
人们喜欢好的灌木丛。

317
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,470
I don't give you my permission
to record me.

317
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,470
我不允许你记录我。

318
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:29,986
<i>Listen to this: Sal is
tonight's big loser.</i>

318
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:29,986
听这个：Sal 是今晚的大输家。

319
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,392
Ah, surprise, surprise.
Sal is our loser.

319
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,392
啊，惊喜，惊喜。Sal 是我们的失败者。

320
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:37,236
We brought him up here to Monarch
Rooftop for a networking event.

320
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:37,236
我们带他来到 Monarch Rooftop 参加一个社交活动。

321
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:39,259
Here's what you got to
do, bud. It's very simple.

321
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:39,259
这是你得做的，伙计。这很简单。

322
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:41,095
We want you to give out
your business card

322
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:41,095
我们希望您分发您的名片

323
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,939
to who <i>we</i> think is the
most important person in the room.

323
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,939
到我们认为房间里最重要的人。

324
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:46,595
And here is your only business card.

324
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:46,595
这是您唯一的名片。

325
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:49,532
<i>[Joe] Only.</i>

325
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:49,532
[乔]只。

326
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,618
There's only one person in that
party that's getting that card.

326
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,618
那个派对中只有一个人拿到了那张卡。

327
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:53,392
Okay?

327
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:53,392
好？

328
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:56,234
You won't know if you gave it to the right
person until after you've given it to them

328
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:56,234
在你把它交给他们之前，你不会知道你是否把它给了正确的人

329
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:57,829
and we've told you right away.
<i>-And then what happens?</i>

329
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:57,829
我们已经马上告诉你了。- 然后会发生什么？

330
00:14:57,854 --> 00:15:00,446
And if you don't get it right, you've
got to take that card back

330
00:14:57,854 --> 00:15:00,446
如果你没有做对，你就必须把那张牌拿回来

331
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:03,517
and give it to the next person.
Because they're not imporant enough!

331
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:03,517
并将其交给下一个人。因为他们不够重要！

332
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:09,063
Alright. I understand everything.

332
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:09,063
好。我什么都懂。

333
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,571
<i>[Joe] So, we're invading New York
Cares' event.</i>

333
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,571
[乔]所以，我们正在入侵 New York Cares 的活动。

334
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,813
This is real charity people.
Real <i>charitable</i> people.

334
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,813
这是真正的慈善人士。真正的慈善人士。

335
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:18,774
These are good people. You should look them up.
-They're all important! But...

335
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:18,774
这些都是好人。你应该查一下。- 他们都很重要！但。。。

336
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,868
<i>Sal's got to find the most
important person in this room.</i>

336
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,868
Sal 必须找到这个房间里最重要的人。

337
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:22,681
Sal, he only has one business card.

337
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:22,681
Sal，他只有一张名片。

338
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,392
<i>[Joe] And here we go.</i>

338
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,392
[乔]我们开始吧。

339
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,056
Hey Tim how are you?
-Hello.

339
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,056
嗨，蒂姆，你好吗？-你好。

340
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:29,298
Pleasure. -Sal? How are you.
-How's everything. -Good

340
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:29,298
快乐。-萨尔？你好吗。- 一切都怎么样。-好

341
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:31,173
This guy's like a bad-ass
Colonel Mustard.

341
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:31,173
这家伙就像个坏蛋 Mustard 上校。

342
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,954
<i>The ascot's on point.</i>

342
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,954
阿斯科特恰到好处。

343
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:36,876
Oh, coat sorting. Okay.

343
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:36,876
哦，外套分类。好。

344
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:40,665
Oh my goodness. That seems,
like, very important.

344
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:40,665
哦，天哪。这似乎非常重要。

345
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,634
To be support, over a decade,
putting in the time.

345
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,634
为了得到支持，十多年来，投入时间。

346
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:46,532
<i>[Joe] Oh, he's trying to sell us on being
important. He seems important. You're right.</i>

346
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:46,532
[乔]哦，他试图说服我们自己很重要。他似乎很重要。你是对的。

347
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:49,071
You might be the most important guy in
here. I might have to stop.

347
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:49,071
你可能是这里最重要的人。我可能不得不停下来。

348
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:50,243
<i>[Joe] You have an ascot on.</i>

348
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:50,243
[乔]你穿上了 ascot。

349
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:53,040
Uh, I might be.
It's a good thing to do.

349
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:53,040
呃，我可能是。这是一件好事。

350
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,642
Let me, let me, let me
give you my card.

350
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,642
让我，让我，让我把我的名片给你。

351
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:58,149
There you go. It says
Salvatore Bruno there:

351
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:58,149
给你。上面写着 Salvatore Bruno：

352
00:15:58,556 --> 00:15:59,962
philanthropist and entrepreneur.

352
00:15:58,556 --> 00:15:59,962
慈善家和企业家。

353
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:02,407
I'd love it if you'd keep in touch. You've
got my number and my email there.

353
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:02,407
如果您能保持联系，我会很高兴。你有我的电话号码和电子邮件。

354
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:04,860
Thank you. I'll see you in a moment.
-Good. Alright, alright. -Okay.

354
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:04,860
谢谢。我们一会儿见。-好。好吧，好吧。-好。

355
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,595
Please say that's him.

355
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,595
请说那是他。

356
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:07,399
No.

356
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:07,399
不。

357
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:11,267
So when do we want to pick who the
most important person in the room is?

357
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:11,267
那么，我们什么时候想选择房间里最重要的人是谁呢？

358
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:12,063
Let's give it a minute?

358
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:12,063
让我们花点时间？

359
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:13,298
I'm going to feel it in my heart.

359
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:13,298
我会在心里感受它。

360
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:14,884
Hey, how you doing?

360
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:14,884
嘿，你好吗？

361
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,211
Elliot. Nice to see you.
What's going on?

361
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,211
埃利奥特。很高兴见到你。这是怎么回事？

362
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:21,837
Yeah, me too.

362
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:21,837
是的，我也是。

363
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:24,517
I'm an entrepreneur and a philanthropist.
But I worked in technology

363
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:24,517
我是一名企业家和慈善家。但我在技术领域工作

364
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:27,227
bringing that to historically
disenfranchised communities.

364
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:27,227
将其带到历史上被剥夺权利的社区。

365
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:29,165
[Together, laughing] "Disenfranchised communities"

365
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:29,165
[一起笑]“被剥夺权利的社区”

366
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:35,556
Mostly Xbox.

366
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:35,556
主要是 Xbox。

367
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:37,774
What do you do?

367
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:37,774
你是做什么工作的？

368
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:42,009
Oh, excellent.

368
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:42,009
哦，太好了。

369
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,813
This guy seems super important.
-Yeah?

369
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,813
这家伙看起来超级重要。-是的？

370
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:45,282
Let me give you my card.

370
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:45,282
让我把我的名片给你。

371
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:47,884
If you ever wanted to do something...
we could do something with the school?

371
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:47,884
如果你曾经想做某事......我们可以对学校做点什么吗？

372
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:50,313
and we could do, like, a
technology initiative there.

372
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:50,313
我们可以在那里做一个技术计划。

373

[Q] 天哪，这太糟糕了！

394
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:41,774
give my business card to.

394
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:41,774
把我的名片交给。

395
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,157
Um.

395
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,157
嗯。

396
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,578
Well

396
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,578
井

397
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:45,555
[Joe] "Well, why don't you!"

397
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:45,555
[乔]“嗯，你为什么不呢！”

398
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,891
therein lies the rub, Tim.

398
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,891
这就是问题所在，蒂姆。

399
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,149
I, uh, I gave you my last one.

399
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,149
我，呃，我把我的最后一颗子弹给了你。

400
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,750
If you wouldn't mind, uh...

400
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,750
如果你不介意的话，呃......

401
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:56,453
Thank you so much.
Okay, thank you.

401
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:56,453
非常感谢。好的，谢谢。

402
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:57,805
<i>[Joe] Oh! And he dismissed him!</i>

402
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:57,805
[乔]哦！他就把他解雇了！

403
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,367
<i>[Joe] Oh! And you got dismissed!</i>

403
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,367
[乔]哦！然后你被解雇了！

404
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:01,258
<i>[Murr] Oh my god!</i>

404
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:01,258
[喃喃自语]哦，我的上帝！

405
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:03,828
That is hard! -Wow! -Oh!

405
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:03,828
这很难！-哇！-哦！

406
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,625
[Murr] Look at Sal's face. He's got
a thousand-yard stare on.

406
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,625
[喃喃自语]看看萨尔的脸。他盯着一千码。

407
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,391
That was tough, bud.
-Ooh.

407
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,391
那很艰难，伙计。-哦。

408
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,836
Elliot, there you go. It's got
my number and email on it.

408
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,836
Elliot，好了。上面有我的电话号码和电子邮件。

409
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:14,227
I'd love for you to reach out.

409
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:14,227
我希望您能伸出援手。

410
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:15,883
Yeah.

410
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:15,883
是的。

411
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:18,117
Sal, he's not the most important
guy in the room. Take the card back.

411
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:18,117
Sal，他不是房间里最重要的人。取回卡。

412
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:21,039
Oh.

412
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:21,039
哦。

413
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:22,922
I, uh... [nervous chuckle]

413
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:22,922
我，呃......[紧张的笑声]

414
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:25,834
I'm just seeing that that
guy over there

414
00:18:23,397 --> 00:18:25,834
我只是在那边看到那个家伙

415
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:27,748
is from a publication

415
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:27,748
来自出版物

416
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:30,006
that I've been trying to

416
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:30,006
我一直在努力

417
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:32,162
to get with for quite some time.

417
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:32,162
相处了很长一段时间。

418
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:33,662
<i>[Joe] And you have my only card.</i>

418
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:33,662
[乔]而你有我唯一的卡。

419
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:34,279
Mmmmmm.

419
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:34,279
嗯嗯。

420
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,154
And you have my last card.

420
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,154
你有我的最后一张卡。

421
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:44,225
Is there any way that I
might be able to

421
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:44,225
有什么办法我可以

422
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,943
have the card back?

422
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,943
拿回卡了吗？

423
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:48,982
Okay.
-So I can give it to him?

423
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:48,982
好。-所以我可以给他吗？

424
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,451
Yeah.

424
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,451
是的。

425
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:51,568
Thank you, Elliot.

425
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:51,568
谢谢你，Elliot。

426
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:54,193
Ohhhhhh.
-Oh my god!

426
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:54,193
哦。-哦，我的上帝！

427
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:58,920
<i>[Q whimpering] Oh, I feel so bad...</i>

427

[Q 呜咽]哦，我感觉好糟糕......

428
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:01,615
Oh ho!
-God, Sal. -My god.

428
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:01,615
哦呵呵！-上帝，萨尔。-我的上帝。

429
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,170
How's everything going, guys?

429
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,170
大家，一切都怎么样？

430
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:08,787
Okay.
-[Q] Sounds important.

430
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:08,787
好。-[Q] 听起来很重要。

431
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:10,045
Let me give you my card.

431
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:10,045
让我把我的名片给你。

432
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:13,037
Philanthropist and entrepreneur.

432
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:13,037
慈善家和企业家。

433
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:17,893
Really?

433
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:17,893
真？

434
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,268
Ohhh.
-Sal, get the card. Get it!

434
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,268
哦。-萨尔，拿到卡。获取它！

435
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,862
That's actually my last card. I'm going
to give it to Patrick.

435
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,862
那实际上是我的最后一张牌。我要把它交给 Patrick。

436
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,994
Lucille Bluth does not like that ####.

436
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,994
露西尔·布鲁斯不喜欢那个 ####。

437
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,299
Oh!

437
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,299
哦！

438
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,103
For the blind. Oh my god.
<i>[Murr smugly] That's very important.</i>

438

为盲人。哦，我的上帝。[得意地喃喃自语]这非常重要。

439
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,596
God, so if you don't...
I just want to...

439
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,596
上帝啊，所以如果你不......我只是想......

440
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:39,768
Robby, I'm going to give to you.

440
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:39,768
Robby，我要给你。

441
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:44,549
You know what it is, I
only had the one. So...

441
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:44,549
你知道那是什么，我只有一个。所以。。。

442
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,758
I'm trying to figure out, who is the...

442
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,758
我试图弄清楚，谁是......

443
00:19:46,783 --> 00:19:49,633
more import... yeah there it is.

443
00:19:46,783 --> 00:19:49,633
更多导入...是的，就在那里。

444
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:50,938
Sal, spoiler alert.

444
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:50,938
Sal，剧透警告。

445
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:52,297
Neither of them are
the important one.

445
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:52,297
他们都不是重要的。

446
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,148
<i>[Joe] Get that card back.</i>

446
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,148
[乔]拿回那张卡。

<i>[Q] Look at the hand, look at the hand!</i>

<i>[Murr] She caught you! She caught you.</i>

448

[喃喃自语]她抓住了你！她抓住了你。

449
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,719
It's a pleasure. Thank you.

449
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,719
很高兴。谢谢。

450
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,414
That was great buddy.
-That was...

450
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,414
那真是个好朋友。-那是......

451
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,023
Jesus #### Christ.

451
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,023
耶稣 #### 基督。

452
00:20:12,117 --> 00:20:14,953
Here's a hint. One of the people
you've already given the card to

452
00:20:12,117 --> 00:20:14,953
这里有一个提示。您已将卡赠予的人之一

453
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:16,813
was the most important
person in the room.

453
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:16,813
是房间里最重要的人。

454
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:20,641
It was either Tim or Elliot.

454
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:20,641
要么是蒂姆，要么是艾略特。

455
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:23,539
They're standing together.

455
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:23,539
他们站在一起。

456
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:25,805
[raucous yelling]

456
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:25,805
[喧闹的吼叫]

457
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:28,953
[Joe makes air horn noise]

457
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:28,953
[乔发出气喇叭声]

458
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,664
...collecting them before we get them.

458
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,664
...在我们得到它们之前收集它们。

459
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:34,305
So...

459
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:34,305
所以。。。

460
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:36,125
Alright.
-Yes.

460
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:36,125
好。-是的。

461
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,727
<i>It's Elliot. It's Elliot. It's Elliot!</i>

461
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,727
是 Elliot。是 Elliot。是 Elliot！

462
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:41,585
Tim, wait. Tim, wait, wait, Tim!
Wait, Tim, wait. Tim, wait, wait, Tim!

462
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:41,585
蒂姆，等等。蒂姆，等等，等等，蒂姆！等等，蒂姆，等等。蒂姆，等等，等等，蒂姆！

463
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,266
Tim, can I just see that?

463
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,266
Tim，我能看到吗？

464
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,281
Can I just see that one second?

464
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,281
我能看到那一秒钟吗？

465
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,461
Tim, thank you. One second, one second.

465
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,461
蒂姆，谢谢你。一秒，一秒。

466
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:51,797
Here you go, Elliot.

466
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:51,797
给你，Elliot。

467
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:54,898
Thank you.
-Our work is done. Our work is done here.

467
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:54,898
谢谢。- 我们的工作完成了。我们的工作在这里完成。

468
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:59,531
Hey, thank you.

468
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:59,531
嘿，谢谢。

469
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:08,398
Okay, so, the guys gave
Sal the business

469
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:08,398
好吧，所以，伙计们把生意交给了 Sal

470
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:09,930
in this very important punishment

470
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:09,930
在这个非常重要的惩罚中

471
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:12,148
and now you get a behind-the-
scenes look at how it happened.

471
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:12,148
现在你可以了解它是如何发生的幕后花絮。

472
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,836
Cheers. Let me give you my card.

472
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,836
干杯。让我把我的名片给你。

473
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,820
So if you're in a networking
event like this

473
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,820
因此，如果您参加这样的社交活动

474
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,297
this would never happen to you.
-No.

474
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,297
这永远不会发生在你身上。-不。

475
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,703
Because you're just the
most important person.

475
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,703
因为你就是最重要的人。

476
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:23,563
I'm the... always the most
important person.

476
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:23,563
我是......永远是最重要的人。

477
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:25,141
So what would do if someone tried to...

477
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:25,141
那么，如果有人试图......

478
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,406
I'd give the business card to myself.

478
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,406
我会把名片给自己。

479
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:27,672
You'd eat it?

479
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:27,672
你会吃吗？

480
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:28,742
Eat the business card.

480
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:28,742
吃掉名片。

481
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,688
That is one way to keep
a business card.

481
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,688
这是保留名片的一种方式。

482
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:33,188
I was at a networking event once, and I
ran out of cards. I had one card left.

482
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:33,188
我有一次参加了一个社交活动，我的卡片用完了。我还剩下一张卡。

483
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:35,015
So that's what was the inspriation
for this whole thing.

483
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:35,015
这就是整件事的灵感来源。

484
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,828
<i>I said, "Murr I should go get
that back", and we laughed.</i>

484
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,828
我说，“嘟嘟，我应该去拿回那个”，我们笑了起来。

485
00:21:36,853 --> 00:21:38,398
<i>But I didn't do it in real life.
-[Casey] Oh, no?</i>

485
00:21:36,853 --> 00:21:38,398
但我在现实生活中没有这样做。-[Casey] 哦，不是吗？

486
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,367
Fast-forward. 20 years later.

486
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,367
快进。20 年后。

487
00:21:40,392 --> 00:21:41,976
We're making Sal do it.
-You make Sal do it.

487
00:21:40,392 --> 00:21:41,976
我们正在让 Sal 去做。- 你让 Sal 去做。

488
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,718
For years, I had my own business cards

488
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,718
多年来，我一直有自己的名片

489
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:44,929
and they were such scams.

489
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:44,929
他们就是这样的骗局。

490
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:45,968
What did they say?

490
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:45,968
他们怎么说呢？

491
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:48,492
Uh, director, executive producer,
producer...

491
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:48,492
呃，导演、执行制片人、制片人......

492
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:49,351
writer.

492
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:49,351
作家。

493
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:50,953
Have you done even
those things now?

493
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:50,953
你现在做过那些事情吗？

494
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:52,413
No, not really.

494
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:52,413
不，不是真的。

495
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,320
You've directed. You did direct.

495
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,320
你导演了。你确实导演了。

496
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:55,811
I've directed short little movies, right?

496
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:55,811
我导演过小电影，对吧？

497
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,703
<i>Damned!</i>, we've seen <i>Damned!</i>
-I directed <i>Damned!</i>

497
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,703
Damned！，我们见过 Damned！-我导演了 Damned！

00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:07,781
Sal 走路。来吧。

502
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:09,882
Sal's walking!

502
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:09,882
萨尔走路了！

"Christopher Walking".
-Say "Sal's walking".

503
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:11,593
“克里斯托弗行走”。- 说“Sal's walking”。

504
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:13,078
Sal's walking.
-Sal's walking.

Sal 走路。

506
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:15,992
Have fun, buddy.
-Okay.

506
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:15,992
祝你玩得开心，伙计。-好。

507
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,773
You want to go for me?

507
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,773
你想找我吗？

508
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:20,390
Okay, there go. It's your beverage.

508
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:20,390
好了，开始吧。这是你的饮料。

509
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:21,648
Got my beverage.

509
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:21,648
拿到我的饮料。

510
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:22,772
Here's your beverage.

510
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:22,772
这是你的饮料。

511
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:23,781
What is, what's this about?

511
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:23,781
这是什么，这是怎么回事？

512
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,023
It's a networking event.
Cheers, boys, to not being punished.

512
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,023
这是一个社交活动。干杯，男孩们，没有受到惩罚。

513
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:28,757
Oh, alright. This is some
networking I can get behind.

513
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:28,757
哦，好吧。这是我可以支持的一些网络。

514
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:32,765
Sal's trying to figure out if people
in the room recognize him from the TV show.

514
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:32,765
Sal 试图弄清楚房间里的人是否从电视节目中认出了他。

515
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,179
This is a necessary step.
We have to walk around first.

515
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,179
这是必要的步骤。我们得先四处走动。

516
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:36,656
Before we start.

516
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:36,656
在我们开始之前。

517
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:40,413
So, right behind you in the
oversized, blue, crushed velvet chair.

517
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:40,413
所以，就在你身后的超大蓝色压碎天鹅绒椅子上。

518
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:44,023
She looked straight at me, had a huge
smile and is looking over here now.

518
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:44,023
她直直地看着我，露出灿烂的笑容，现在正看着这边。

519
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,499
It might be because I'm attractive.
It might not be.

519
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,499
可能是因为我很有吸引力。可能不是。

520
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:50,554
Here's another news flash.
I don't know what I'm doing here.

520
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:50,554
这是另一个新闻快讯。我不知道我在这里做什么。

521
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:53,163
It's a networking event.
-Yeah, you're supposed to be making connections.
-Network!

521
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:53,163
这是一个社交活动。- 是的，你应该建立联系。-网络！

522
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:56,538
I know but they... all these
people work for "who cares".

522
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:56,538
我知道，但他们......所有这些人都为“谁在乎”工作。

523
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:58,679
<i>[Joe] No! Not "who cares"</i>

523

524

Murray 经营着 “who cares”。

525
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:02,453
That's Murray's charity. "Who cares"

525
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:02,453
那是 Murray 的慈善机构。“谁在乎”

526
00:23:03,054 --> 00:23:03,921
How are you enjoying it?

526
00:23:03,054 --> 00:23:03,921
你觉得怎么样？

527
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:10,163
So then, you're not very important
here in this situation?

527
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:10,163
那么，在这种情况下，你不是很重要吗？

528
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:15,718
Gotcha. I'm [unintelligible].
Thank you very much.

530
00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:25,124
Okay, well, what type of
technology? I mean, because...

530
00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:25,124
好的，嗯，什么类型的技术？我的意思是，因为......

Oh, now he's got to give details!

00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,031
on, you know, the whole
place here.

553
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,031
你知道的，这里的整个地方。

554
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:24,688
I mean, he doesn't reflect on me.

554
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:24,688
我的意思是，他不会反思我。

555
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:25,789
Thank God.

555
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:25,789
谢天谢地。

556
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:28,859
Do I own the whole place as a doctor?

556
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:28,859
作为医生，我拥有整个地方吗？

557
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:30,227
Am I Raymond?

557
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:30,227
我是雷蒙德吗？
