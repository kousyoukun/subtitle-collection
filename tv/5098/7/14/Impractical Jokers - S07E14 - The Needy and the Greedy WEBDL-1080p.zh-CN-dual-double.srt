1
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:18,252
<i>Coming up! What's got Joe sleeping on the job?</i>

1
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:18,252
即将到来！是什么让 Joe 在工作中睡着了？

2
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,659
<i>Why is Sal taking the fall?</i>

2
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,659
为什么 Sal 会跌倒？

3
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:29,674
<i>And which losing Joker will have major
hunger pains in tonight's punishment?</i>

3
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:29,674
哪只输掉的小丑会在今晚的惩罚中感到非常饥饿？

4
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:34,823
Prepare for something amazing!

4
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:34,823
准备好迎接精彩瞬间吧！

5
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,635
Hey, mustache, what's up?

5
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,635
嘿，小胡子，怎么了？

6
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,948
I want my mommy!

6
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,948
我要我的妈妈！

7
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:43,690
I will never forgive you!

7
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:43,690
我永远不会原谅你！

8
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:46,276
Larry!

8
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:46,276
拉里！

9
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,534
<i>[Sal] She's all about that 'cado!</i>

9
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,534
[萨尔]她全心全意地专注于那个 'cado！

10
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,401
Today, we're at Focus Pointe Global

10
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,401
今天，我们来到了 Focus Pointe Global

11
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,330
and we're participating in, go
figure, a focus group.

11
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,330
我们正在参加一个焦点小组。

12
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,666
We're also going to be volunteering
to take notes for the group on this computer.

12
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,666
我们还将自愿在这台计算机上为小组做笔记。

13
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:01,518
The catch is, though, the other
guys will be controlling it.

13
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:01,518
不过，问题是，其他人将控制它。

14
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:03,432
Plus, there's a big monitor
in the room

14
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:03,432
此外，房间里还有一个大显示器

15
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:05,486
so everyone can see the notes
that are being taken.

15
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:05,486
这样每个人都可以看到正在记的笔记。

16
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:07,486
If the notes get too hot to handle

16
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:07,486
如果音符变得太热而无法处理

17
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:09,729
and you close that computer
to end your own pain

17
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:09,729
然后你关闭那台电脑来结束你自己的痛苦

18
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:10,658
you lose.

18
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:10,658
你丢失。

19
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,557
You guys can take a seat
wherever you like.

19
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,557
你们可以在任何你想坐的地方坐下。

20
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:18,197
How's everybody doing?

20
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:18,197
大家都好吗？

21
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:19,674
<i>[Q] Moderating is
our boy Chase.</i>

21
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:19,674
[Q] 主持人是我们的孩子 Chase。

22
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:22,471
He's going to be guiding the whole
thing exactly where we want it to go.

22
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:22,471
他将引导整个事情准确地朝着我们希望的方向发展。

23
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:24,557
Topic today is going to be
artificial intelligence.

23
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:24,557
今天的主题将是人工智能。

24
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,440
<i>I do need a volunteer
for a notetaker.</i>

24
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,440
我确实需要一个志愿者来做笔记员。

25
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:31,025
Yeah? Okay, this is the note pad right here.
You can just dictate into it.

25
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:31,025
是的？好的，这是这里的记事本。你可以口述它。

26
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,736
Good acting. Sold it.

26
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,736
演技好。卖了。

27
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:36,588
<i>So the first question for today is:
"How would you define AI"?</i>

27
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:36,588
所以今天的第一个问题是：“您如何定义 AI”？

28
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,650
It's, uh, man made?

28
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,650
这是，呃，人造的？

29
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:42,619
<i>Uh, computerized?</i>

29
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:42,619
呃，电脑化了？

30
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:45,921
I think of robotics, when I think
of artificial intelligence.

30
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:45,921
当我想到人工智能时，我会想到机器人技术。

31
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:48,935
Um, I think it's like in many
different, like, platforms now.

31
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:48,935
嗯，我认为现在很多不同的平台都是这样。

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,583
<i>We have it in our cell phones now.</i>

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,583
我们现在的手机里有它。

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,104
Type, Sal.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,104
类型，Sal.

34
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:55,651
<i>[Woman] Controllable, but then it
could not be controllable.</i>

34
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:55,651
[女士]可控，但随后它就无法控制。

35
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,963
<i>[Murr] Look at her!
[Q] She's already in.</i>

35
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,963
[喃喃自语]看看她！[Q] 她已经进来了。

36
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:03,572
What aspects of AI do you
see in everyday life?

36
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:03,572
您在日常生活中看到了 AI 的哪些方面？

37
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:06,548
Okay. Google, Alexa, like Nest.

37
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:06,548
好。Google、Alexa，就像 Nest 一样。

38
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:11,400
I think it's like a hub for temperature,
like thermostats?

38
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:11,400
我觉得它就像一个温度中心，就像恒温器一样？

39
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:15,632
<i>[Woman] You could like, update
it from your phone...</i>

39
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:15,632
[女士]你可以喜欢，从你的手机更新它......

40
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:17,156
<i>and close your garage door.</i>

40
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:17,156
并关上你的车库门。

41
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,843
<i>-Yeah. Like, um, or even um...</i>

41
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,843
-是的。就像，嗯，甚至嗯......

42
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:21,023
<i>what is it, like smoke
detectors?</i>

42
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:21,023
它是什么，就像烟雾探测器一样？

43
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:22,616
<i>[Q laughing] "It went great."</i>

43
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:22,616
[Q笑]“进展顺利。”

44
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:31,374
AI can be destructive in that it's

44
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:31,374
AI 可能具有破坏性，因为它

45
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:35,234
<i>removed, like, the humanity
from people you begin to rely on.</i>

45
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:35,234
就像你开始依赖的人一样，去除了人性。

46
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:38,804
<i>-Things to do work for us
other than people.</i>

46
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:38,804
- 为我们工作的事情，而不是人。

47
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,741
What does that mean?

47
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,741
那是什么意思？

48
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:49,312
Uh, I'm just, what I was gleaning
from the conversation but

48
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:49,312
呃，我只是，我从谈话中收集到的，但是

49
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:52,077
Right, but when did we say that?
-No one said that, though.

49
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:52,077
是的，但我们什么时候这么说的呢？- 不过，没有人这么说。

50
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:57,116
What steps can be taken, then,
to avoid an AI related disaster?

50
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:57,116
那么，可以采取哪些措施来避免与 AI 相关的灾难呢？

51
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,304
<i>[Man] So, like, self-driving cars,
I think, I don't know... [unintelligible]

51
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,304
[男子]所以，就像自动驾驶汽车一样，我想，我不知道......[难以理解]

52
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:05,101
<i>right now it has to have a
driver still in the driver's seat?</i>

52
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:05,101
现在它必须有一个驾驶员仍然坐在驾驶座上？

53
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:09,195
<i>[Joe] How do you not close it!?</i>

53
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:09,195
[乔]你怎么不关它！？

54
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:12,687
Just like my, my spouse,
is very tech friendly?

54
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:12,687
就像我一样，我的配偶，对技术非常友好吗？

55
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:16,694
<i>If I didn't have him, I'd probably
would be, like, still in the Stone Ages.</i>

55
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:16,694
如果我没有他，我可能还在石器时代。

56
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,374
How do you keep that open!?

56
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,374
你怎么保持开放！？

57
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,031
<i>[Q] Wow! Sal is
unbreakable!</i>

57
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,031
[Q] 哇！萨尔牢不可破！

58
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,788
Our topic today is "vacation".

58
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,788
我们今天的主题是 “假期”。

59
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:31,015
Q, if you shut the computer,
you lose.

59
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:31,015
Q，如果关闭计算机，则输了。

60
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,663
So first, let's talk about your
ideal vacation.

60
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,663
那么首先，让我们谈谈您理想的假期。

61
00:03:33,843 --> 00:03:35,531
<i>Whoever, whoever wants
to go first.</i>

61
00:03:33,843 --> 00:03:35,531
无论谁，谁想先走。

62
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:37,624
Being on the beach and relaxing...

62
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:37,624
在海滩上放松......

63
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:40,374
<i>[Man] From one vacation to the next, I always
try to do something that's different.</i>

63
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:40,374
[男子]从一个假期到另一个假期，我总是尝试做一些不同的事情。

64
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,640
<i>Something that you have
never done before.</i>

64
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,640
您以前从未做过的事情。

65
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:43,632
<i>[Other man] Like a new place,
new city where you...</i>

65
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:43,632
[其他男子]就像一个新的地方，新的城市，你......

66
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:46,273
<i>...and... "free", maybe?</i>

66
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:46,273
...和。。。也许是“免费”？

67
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:48,163
<i>[Woman laughing] Yeah,
free is good, yeah!</i>

67
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:48,163
[女人笑]是的，免费就是好，是的！

68
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:52,085
<i>[Moderator] On that note, what
are some places that you guys have been to</i>

68
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:52,085
[主持人]关于这一点，你们去过哪些地方

69
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,156
<i>and, you know, feel free to run down
the list of some places you've been to</i>

69
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,156
而且，你知道的，你可以随意列出你去过的一些地方

70
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,514
<i>and describe them, and...</i>

70
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,514
并描述它们，然后......

71
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,905
<i>[Man] I've been to London. To Rio.</i>

71
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,905
[男子]我去过伦敦。到里约热内卢。

72
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,585
Rio was my favorite.

72
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,585
里约热内卢是我的最爱。

73
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:06,124
<i>[chuckling] I like Rio.</i>

73
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:06,124
[轻笑]我喜欢里约热内卢。

74
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:07,538
<i>Very nice culturally.</i>

74
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:07,538
在文化上非常好。

75
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,155
<i>Very diverse.</i>

75
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,155
非常多样化。

76
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:15,303
<i>The one place that I found out
of all the places that I went that</i>

76
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:15,303
在我去过的所有地方中，我发现的一个地方是

77
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,858
really welcomed a black man.

77
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,858
真的欢迎一个黑人。

78
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:22,069
<i>They have, like, the second largest
black population other than...</i>

78
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:22,069
他们拥有除......

79
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:23,405
<i>North America.</i>

79
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:23,405
北美洲。

80
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:26,036
And that's it!

80
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:26,036
就是这样！

81
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,848
<i>So, today, we are going to
be talking about</i>

81
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,848
所以，今天，我们将讨论

82
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:33,168
<i>artificial intelligence.</i>

82
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:33,168
人工智能。

83
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:35,528
How would you define
artificial intelligence?

83
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:35,528
您如何定义人工智能？

84
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:36,676
Type, Murr.

84
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:36,676
类型，Murr。

85
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,176
<i>It's supposed to help us
have more efficiency.</i>

85
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,176
它应该帮助我们提高效率。

86
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:44,863
<i>[Brit] ...are computers that can think
or any something that can think.</i>

86
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:44,863
[英国] ...是可以思考的计算机或任何可以思考的东西。

87
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:46,762
Something that's programmed
initially.

87
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:46,762
最初编程的东西。

88
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:50,176
<i>...the scope to have a conscience, but</i>

88
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:50,176
...有良心的范围，但是

89
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,676
<i>if we pro... program it with enough...</i>

89
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,676
如果我们支持...用足够的...

90
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:56,785
<i>it can do all the sums that we can't.
And then...</i>

90
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:56,785
它可以完成我们不能做的所有总和。然后。。。

91
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,481
[Stripes] I agree with you.

91
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,481
[条纹]我同意你的看法。

92
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:01,621
<i>The people who manage
that type of technology</i>

92
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:01,621
管理此类技术的人员

93
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:04,239
<i>they, like, uh, have the...</i>

93
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:04,239
他们，就像，呃，有......

94
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:05,996
It's just so instant, isn't it?

94
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:05,996
它就是如此瞬间，不是吗？

95
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:08,598
<i>[Brit] They can be on their phone,
chitty-chatty</i>

95
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:08,598
[英国]他们可以在手机上闲聊

96
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:09,674
with their fingers

96
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:09,674
用他们的手指

97
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,565
<i>but can't have a conversation.</i>

97
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,565
但不能进行对话。

98
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,744
Murr's not closing his laptop. We
have to get him to close his laptop here.

98
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,744
Murr 没有合上他的笔记本电脑。我们得让他把他的笔记本电脑关上。

99
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,283
I think, also, another thing
is like your photos

99
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,283
我认为，还有一件事是你的照片

100
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:23,596
<i>and if you lose them</i>

100
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:23,596
如果你失去了它们

101
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,064
<i>[Stripes] In these days
we didn't live the moment and</i>

101
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,064
[条纹]在这些日子里，我们没有活在当下，

102
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,197
<i>we sometimes took a
photo and then</i>

102
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,197
我们有时会拍一张照片，然后

103
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:31,440
<i>"Ah, yeah, I remember this".
And then like...</i>

103
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:31,440
“啊，是的，我记得这个。”然后就像......

104
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:35,611
And then we're able to go
home and go on the computer

104
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:35,611
然后我们就可以回家使用电脑了

105
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:38,283
<i>and then, there's a lot of
negative things on there.</i>

105
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:38,283
然后，那里有很多负面的东西。

106
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:39,932
<i>A lot of people that
put a lot of negative...</i>

106
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:39,932
很多人都把很多负面的东西放在了......

107
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:41,080
<i>[Moderator] Oh, I see
what you're saying.</i>

107
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:41,080
[主持人]哦，我明白你在说什么了。

108
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:43,736
And then, it's fueling
people to

108
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:43,736
然后，它激励人们

109
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,822
<i>think instead of
being connected and</i>

109
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,822
思考而不是连接

110
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,095
<i>[Q, Joe, Sal laughing over dialog]</i>

110
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,095
[Q、Joe、Sal 在对话中大笑]

111
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,174
So... but then I don't
know if I'm drifting off...

111
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,174
所以。。。但随后我不知道我是不是要走神了......

112
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,955
No, I think, I think that you
make some good points.

112
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,955
不，我认为，我认为你提出了一些很好的观点。

113
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:55,252
<i>Let's review the notes.</i>

113
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:55,252
让我们回顾一下笔记。

114
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,424
Yeah, she said, uh...

114
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,424
是的，她说，呃......

115
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,900
"Your photos... and if you ... these days...
we want to live in the moment

115
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,900
“你的照片......如果你......目前。。。我们想活在当下

116
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:02,268
then oh I remember this
like I never had

116
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:02,268
然后哦，我记得这是我从未有过的

117
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:05,065
<i>so what do you all think about
that because I think that we're able</i>

117
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:05,065
那么你们对此有何看法，因为我认为我们能够

118
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,197
<i>I think that we should
have more interaction</i>

118
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,197
我认为我们应该有更多的互动

119
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,916
<i>and be more connected
and we're able to go home</i>

119
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,916
并且联系更加紧密，我们能够回家

120
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:12,471
<i>and go on the computer
and there are a lot of negative things</i>

120
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:12,471
然后上电脑，有很多负面的事情

121
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,471
<i>on there... is freaking people...
to be connected...</i>

121
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,471
在那儿......真是该死的人......要连接...

122
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:17,705
<i>instead of going out in the
world and people can be like</i>

122
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:17,705
而不是走出去，人们可以像

<i>[stammering] anonymous</i>

123

<i>you know but then I don't
know if I'm drifting off."</i>

124
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:21,213
你知道的，但我不知道我是不是要走神了。

125
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:22,900
That's all I got.

125
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:22,900
这就是我所得到的。

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,088
I don't think it was meant
to be verbatim.

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,088
我不认为这是逐字逐句的。

127
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:26,065
Nailed it.

127
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:26,065
搞定了。

128
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,580
<i>[Q] Wow!</i>

128
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,580
[Q] 哇！

<i>You guys can take a

你们可以在任何你想坐的地方坐下。

<i>How's everyone doing?</i>

130
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:32,643
大家都好吗？

131
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:33,908
<i>[Murr] What are you wearing?</i>

131
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:33,908
[喃喃自语]你穿什么？

132
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:34,877
Stella's jacket.

132
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:34,877
斯特拉的夹克。

133
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:35,822
<i>[Murr] It's Stella's jacket?</i>

133
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:35,822
[喃喃自语]这是 Stella 的夹克？

134
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:39,963
<i>[Q] In what reality are you wearing
a jacket that's fifty times too small for you?</i>

134
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:39,963
[Q] 你穿着一件对你来说小了 50 倍的夹克，在什么情况下？

135
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:41,744
...be talking about vacations.

135
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:41,744
...谈论假期。

136
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:43,502
<i>Sound good?</i>
-Great.
<i>-Cool.</i>

136
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:43,502
听起来不错？-伟大。-凉。

137
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:47,650
I need a notetaker.
Anybody want to...?

137
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:47,650
我需要一个记录器。有人想...？

138
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,260
Oh, yeah.

138
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,260
哦，是的。

139
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:50,729
You want to n...? Alright, so you're
going to sit here, actually.

139
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:50,729
你想...？好了，你实际上要坐在这里。

140
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:56,190
Alright. So first up is, just,
talk about your ideal vacation.

140
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:56,190
好。所以首先，谈谈你理想的假期。

141
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:58,979
Ideal vacation, it would be
South Korea

141
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:58,979
理想的假期，将是韩国

142
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,065
<i>because that's where
I'm from.</i>

142
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,065
因为那是我的家乡。

143
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,087
<i>And I also like San Juan,
Puerto Rico a lot.</i>

143
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,087
我也非常喜欢波多黎各的圣胡安。

144
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:05,650
<i>That's as far as my...</i>

144
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:05,650
这就是我的......

145
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:10,010
<i>[Woman] I want to go
somewhere where it's cold, because...</i>

145
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:10,010
[女士]我想去一个寒冷的地方，因为......

146
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:13,893
<i>...go somewhere, like, maybe
like, Connecticut or Vermont.</i>

146
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:13,893
...去某个地方，比如，也许像康涅狄格州或佛蒙特州。

147
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:17,361
<i>[Moderator] Uh, how about you?</i>

147
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:17,361
[主持人]呃，你呢？

148
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:20,361
<i>[man] For me, it would be somewhere
that allows me to kinda like, go out</i>

148
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:20,361
[男]对我来说，这将是一个让我有点喜欢出去的地方

149
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:22,658
<i>like a venture, but it's also
around where</i>

149
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:22,658
就像一个冒险，但它也在附近

150
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:24,229
<i>like a water, like a beach...</i>

150
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:24,229
像水，像海滩......

151
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,916
Anyone can jump in.

151
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,916
任何人都可以加入。

152
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:36,565
If you could take anyone on vacation...?

152
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:36,565
如果你能带任何人去度假...？

153
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,057
I'd bring both my parents.
They always loved Aruba.

153
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,057
我会带上我的父母。他们一直很喜欢阿鲁巴岛。

154
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,807
Aruba.

154
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,807
阿鲁巴岛。

155
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:42,190
[dramatic sting]

155
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:42,190
[戏剧性的刺痛]

156
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:53,002
If you could take anyone on vacation...?

156
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:53,002
如果你能带任何人去度假...？

157
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:55,440
I'd bring both my parents.
They always loved Aruba.

00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:55,440
我会带上我的父母。他们一直很喜欢阿鲁巴岛。

158
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,190
Aruba.

158
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,190
阿鲁巴岛。

159
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,283
So we're going to move on
to, uh, to, like, hotels.

159
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,283
所以我们要继续讨论酒店。

160
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,596
<i>Would you prefer to stay
in a hotel, or you just like...</i>

160
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,596
您是想住在酒店，还是只想住在酒店里......

161
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,244
<i>or use home sharing websites?</i>

161
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,244
或者使用家庭共享网站？

162
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:17,330
<i>[woman] Airbnb's more,
like, affordable...</i>

162
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:17,330
[女人]Airbnb 更实惠......

163
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:19,307
<i>Let's say for example you're
going to, like, uh,</i>

163
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:19,307
例如，假设您要，例如，呃，

164
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,010
<i>you know, like, a city,
like L.A.?</i>

164
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,010
你知道，比如，像洛杉矶这样的城市吗？

165
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:24,072
<i>If you go to someone's home,
whatever area they're around...</i>

165
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:24,072
如果你去某人的家，无论他们周围是什么地方......

166
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,924
<i>[man] Yeah, I like, um,
Airbnb is, like, the way to go.</i>

166
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,924
[男]是的，我喜欢，嗯，Airbnb 就是要走的路。

167
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:30,565
<i>Like, when I think of,
like, hotels</i>

167
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:30,565
就像，当我想到酒店时

168
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,346
<i>I thinking about like, me going
to a conference</i>

168
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,346
我想着，我去参加一个会议

169
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:34,096
<i>or something like that. And
I'm just like...</i>

169
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:34,096
或类似的东西。我就想......

170
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:37,854
<i>[Q, Murr, Sal] Ohhhh! Ohhhh!</i>

170
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:37,854
[Q， 穆尔， 萨尔]哦！哦！

171
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,861
We're never going to get this guy.
We're never going to get this guy!

171
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,861
我们永远都抓不到这个家伙。我们永远也抓不到这个家伙！

172
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,064
<i>[Moderator] What about you guys?
-Ummm...</i>

172
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,064
[主持人]你们呢？-嗯......

173
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:46,713
<i>I think I'd prefer to be like,
active and/or, like, relaxing.</i>

173
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:46,713
我想我更喜欢像、活跃和/或放松。

174
00:08:46,738 --> 00:08:48,533
<i>I think personally it's because like...
[Murr] Uh oh!</i>

174
00:08:46,738 --> 00:08:48,533
我个人认为这是因为......[喃喃自语]呃哦！

175
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:50,049
<i>[Murr] His blood sugar is low.</i>

175
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:50,049
[喃喃自语]他的血糖很低。

176
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,463
<i>[man] I work as like a consultant,
like an analyst...</i>

176
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,463
[男]我像顾问一样工作，像分析师......

177
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:54,307
<i>so I do like numbers
a lot, everyday</i>

177
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:54,307
所以我每天都非常喜欢数字

178
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,150
<i>[laughing over dialog]</i>

178
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,150
[对话中大笑]

179
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:10,354
<i>Q had to "force quit" this one, so
he's first up on the loser board.</i>

179
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:10,354
Q 必须 “强制退出” 这个，所以他首先出现在失败者董事会上。

180
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:12,518
Today, we're at Morton
Williams Supermarket

180
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:12,518
今天，我们在 Morton Williams 超市

181
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:14,674
trying to get a witness
to help us out with a little

181
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:14,674
试图找一个证人来帮助我们

182
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,018
insurance fraud.

182
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,018
保险欺诈。

183
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:18,807
After calling attention to
an "unsafe" store condition,

183
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:18,807
在提请注意“不安全”的商店状况后，

184
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,729
we'll tell a fellow shopper we
wouldn't mind having an "accident"

184
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,729
我们会告诉其他购物者，我们不介意发生 “事故”

185
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:22,932
in order to collect money.

185
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:22,932
为了收钱。

186
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,385
Then the other guys will give us
a weird reason we need the money

186
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,385
然后其他人会给我们一个奇怪的理由，我们需要这笔钱

187
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,650
and we're going to take
a huge dive.

187
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,650
我们将进行一次巨大的潜水。

188
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:29,065
When the store "manager" comes
out to see what happened,

188
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:29,065
当店“经理”出来查看发生了什么事时，

189
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,565
we'll have to get the fellow
shopper to back up our story.

189
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,565
我们得让其他购物者来支持我们的故事。

190
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,486
If they don't back up your
story, you lose.

190
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,486
如果他们不支持您的故事，您就输了。

191
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:35,463
[All] Whoa whoa whoa!

191
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:35,463
[全部]哇哇哇哇！

192
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:41,307
<i>[Joe] Okay, so basically, we're
doing our best pratfall work today.</i>

192
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:41,307
[乔]好的，基本上，我们今天正在做我们最好的 pratfall 工作。

193
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:43,377
We're going to take out an
endcap and ask somebody to, uh,

193
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:43,377
我们要拿出一个端盖，然后请人，呃，

194
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:44,635
corroborate our story.

194
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:44,635
证实我们的故事。

195
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,072
<i>[Joe] The manager today is being
played by one of our favorites:</i>

195
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,072
[乔]今天的经理由我们最喜欢的一位扮演：

196
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:48,437
our comedy producer John.

196
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:48,437
我们的喜剧制作人约翰。

197
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,086
<i>Who actually, in reality, did
manage a grocery store.</i>

197
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,086
实际上，谁确实管理着一家杂货店。

198
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:52,906
Keeping it real.
We keep it real.

198
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:52,906
保持真实。我们保持真实。

199
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:54,406
<i>[Q] Here we go.</i>

199
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:54,406
[Q] 我们开始吧。

200
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,344
Do you think that someone could
trip on this thing on the end?

200
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,344
你认为有人会在最后被这个东西绊倒吗？

201
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:59,125
It's a little bit on the...
I'm a little nervous for people.

201
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:59,125
它有点......我对人们有点紧张。

202
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,288
I think it might be...
-On this corner?

202
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,288
我想可能是......-在这个角落？

203
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:02,632
Yeah, right here. I think it's like
I'm afraid someone's knock in

203
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:02,632
是的，就在这里。我觉得这就像我害怕有人敲门一样

204
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:04,648
to it and it's going to fall
one someone. Right?
-Oh my god.

204
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:04,648
到它，它会落在一个人身上。右？-哦，我的上帝。

205
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,202
Yeah, I think you're right.

205
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,202
是的，我认为你是对的。

206
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:08,515
Yeah, someone could fall and
really, and really hurt themselves.

206
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:08,515
是的，有人可能会跌倒，然后真的、真的伤到自己。

207
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,218
They'll probably sue the grocery store.
-That's true.

207
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,218
他们可能会起诉杂货店。- 这是真的。

208
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,976
Believe me, I could use
the money myself.

208
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,976
相信我，我可以自己用这笔钱。

209
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,663
"My mother needs a
breast reduction."

209
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,663
“我妈妈需要缩胸。”

210
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,226
My mom needs a
breast reduction.

210
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,226
我妈妈需要乳房缩小术。

211
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:21,155
<i>Yeah...</i>

211
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:21,155
是的。。。

212
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:22,999
I know, right?

212
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:22,999
我知道，对吧？

213
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,874
They were on the end, here.

213
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,874
他们在终点，在这里。

214
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,734
I can't believe you did this!

214
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,734
我简直不敢相信你做了这个！

215
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,695
<i>[Joe] Send in the manager.</i>

215
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,695
[乔]请送管理器。

216
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:32,976
What happened?
-I'm sorry.

216
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:32,976
发生了什么事？-对不起。

217
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,515
Are you the manager?
-Yeah.

217
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,515
您是经理吗？-是的。

218
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,687
<i>[Q] Look at the face!</i>

218
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,687
[Q] 看那张脸！

219
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:38,046
These, uh, these were
stacked on the end here.

219
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:38,046
这些，呃，这些都堆在了这儿的最后。

220
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:39,249
Not a good place.

220
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:39,249
不是一个好地方。

221
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:41,405
I was walking. I tripped,
and they all fell.

221
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:41,405
我走路。我绊倒了，他们都倒下了。

222
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:43,015
She saw it. She saw it!

222
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:43,015
她看到了。她看到了！

223
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:46,452
Ma'am, is that true? Because I
have to fill out an accident report.

223
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:46,452
马，这是真的吗？因为我必须填写事故报告。

224
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:48,429
Yeah, yeah, you know
because she agreed with me.

224
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:48,429
是的，是的，你知道的，因为她同意我的看法。

225
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:52,515
Okay. Alright.
<i>-[Joe] You lost!</i>

225
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:52,515
好。好。-[Joe] 你输了！

226
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,155
Alright.

226
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,155
好。

227
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,546
This look high to you?

227
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,546
这个看起来高吗？

228
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,257
Like a safety issue?

228
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,257
喜欢安全问题？

229
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,851
I just worry that it would, like,
fall on a child or something like that.

229
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,851
我只是担心它会落在孩子身上或类似的东西。

230
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,163
That's a big lawsuit.

230
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,163
这是一场大诉讼。

231
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,648
That's big money.

231
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,648
那可是一大笔钱。

232
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:10,101
I mean, honestly, I
could use the money.

232
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:10,101
我的意思是，老实说，我可以用这笔钱。

233
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:12,866
"I don't know if you can tell by looking at me..."
-I don't know if you can tell by looking at me...

233
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:12,866
“我不知道你看我能不能看出来......”——我不知道你看我能不能看出来......

234
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:15,546
"But I want to open a vape shop."
-But I want to open a vape shop.

234
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:15,546
“但我想开一家电子烟店。”- 但我想开一家电子烟店。

235
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:22,476
<i>[Murr] Oh, oh oh oh!</i>

235
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:22,476
[喃喃自语]哦，哦！

236
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,944
<i>[Joe] Oh, banana peel. Nice!
-[Murr] No!</i>

236
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,944
[乔]哦，香蕉皮。好！-[Murr] 不！

237
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:27,390
Ohhhh.

237
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:27,390

哦！

239
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,351
Ohh.

<i>Oh, I'm hurt.</i>

哦，我受伤了。

241
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:34,312
Ohhhh.

241
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:34,312
哦。

242
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:35,710
Sir, you alright?

242
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:35,710
先生，您还好吗？

243
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:38,437
Sir, there was a banana. I slipped.
I fell into this thing.

243
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:38,437
先生，有一根香蕉。我滑倒了。我陷入了这个困境。

244
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:40,106
Oh, oh, my neck!

244
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:40,106
哦，哦，我的脖子！

245
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:42,043
She saw. She's my witness.

245
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:42,043
她看到了。她是我的证人。

246
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:45,300
Call an ambulance.
-What happened?

246
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:45,300
叫救护车。-发生了什么事？

247
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:47,003
I got to fill out an accident report.
Did you witness this?

247
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:47,003
我得填写一份事故报告。你目睹了吗？

248
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:49,004
He did not?

248
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:49,004
他没有？

249
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:49,879
What happened?

249
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:49,879
发生了什么事？

250
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:55,324
Ohh. Call an ambulance!

250
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:55,324
哦。叫救护车！

251
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,059
This is something. Did you
see this display?

251
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,059
这是很了不起的。您看到这个显示了吗？

252
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:01,801
<i>This is a disaster waiting
to happen, don't you think?</i>

252
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:01,801
这是一场等待发生的灾难，你不觉得吗？

253
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:03,137
Possibly.

253
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:03,137
可能。

254
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:05,652
I mean, someone could trip over...
the edges are not straight.

254
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:05,652
我的意思是，有人可能会绊倒......边缘不直。

255
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:08,285
I got to tell you, I could
actually use the money myself.

255
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:08,285
我得告诉你，我自己其实可以用这笔钱。

256
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,824
Here's why.
<i>-[Joe] "I love to gamble."</i>

256
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,824
原因如下。-[Joe] “我喜欢赌博。”

257
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,184
I love to gamble.

257
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,184
我喜欢赌博。

258
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:13,301
And I just got back
from "Korean Vegas".

258
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:13,301
我刚从“韩国维加斯”回来。

259
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:14,840
I...

259
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:14,840
我。。。

260
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:16,715
I just got back
from "Korean Vegas".

260
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:16,715
我刚从“韩国维加斯”回来。

261
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,910
You can't beat the bank,
you know what I'm saying?

261
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,910
你不能打败银行，你知道我在说什么吗？

262
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,098
You know what?

262
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,098
你知道吗？

263
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,809
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

啊！

265
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:33,137
Who put this display...
No, I'm not okay!

265
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:33,137
谁把这个显示器...不，我不行！

266
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:35,707
Where's the manager?
Who put the display like this?

266
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:35,707
经理在哪里？谁把显示器放成这样？

267
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,269
<i>[Joe] He's out, he's gone!</i>

267
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,269
[乔]他出去了，他走了！

268
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:40,004
Matt <3 Ali

268
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:40,004
马特 <3 阿里

269

Ahhhh!

啊！

271
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:51,402
Where's the manager?
Who put the display like this?

271
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:51,402
经理在哪里？谁把显示器放成这样？

272
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,598
<i>[Q] Look at him, he's out of there.
[Joe] He's out, he's gone!</i>

272
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,598
[Q] 看看他，他已经离开了。[乔]他出去了，他走了！

273
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:55,582
Send in the manager!

273
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:55,582
送来经理！

274
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:57,504
The guy up there in the
register saw what happened.

274
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:57,504
收银台上的那个人看到了发生的事情。

275
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,168
In the hat on.
-In the hat witnessed it?

275
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,168
在帽子上。-在帽子里目睹了它？

276
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:01,793
Stay right here, we'll fill out...
-Bring him over here, he'll tell you what happened.

待在这里，我们会填写......- 把他带到这里，他会告诉你发生了什么。

277
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:02,637
It was crazy.

277
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:02,637
这太疯狂了。

278
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,269
The manager had to go chase this guy down.

278
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,269
经理不得不去追赶这个家伙。

279
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:05,473
You think he's going to vouch for you?

279
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:05,473
你觉得他会为你担保吗？

280
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:06,582
The manager?

280
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:06,582
经理？

281
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:07,340
John!

281
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:07,340
John！

282
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,051
He's so real. I'm buying into it.
-You're buying into it.

282
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,051
他太真实了。我正在接受它。- 你买进了它。

283
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:12,902
<i>Here we go. Here we go.</i>

283
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:12,902
来吧。来吧。

284
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,121
Sir?
-Yes.

284
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,121
先生？-是的。

285
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:16,699
He saw what happened, that
this whole display was...

285
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:16,699
他看到了发生的事情，这整个展示是......

286
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:18,816
What?

286
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:18,816
什么？

287
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,176
No honor among thieves,
apparently?

287
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,176
显然，在盗贼中没有荣誉吗？

288
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:30,004
Alright, this is Joe's...
his body was literally built for this.

288
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:30,004
好吧，这是乔的......他的身体真的就是为此而生的。

289
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,074
Uh huh. Made for
falling into cereal.

289
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,074
嗯。适合掉入麦片。

290
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:34,457
[dog barking in the distance]

290
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:34,457
[远处的狗吠声]

291
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,379
Does that dog need a home?
<i>-[Q] No, no!</i>

291
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,379
那只狗需要一个家吗？-[Q] 不，不！

292
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:37,801
Don't adopt that dog, Joe.

292
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:37,801
不要收养那只狗，乔。

293
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:38,691
[Murr] Doesn't... dog need a home.

293
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:38,691
[喃喃自语]不。。。狗需要一个家。

294
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:41,660
<i>Alright, here you go.</i>

294
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:41,660
好了，给你。

295
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,137
They got good 'cados [avocados] today.

295
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,137
他们今天吃到了很好的 'cados [鳄梨]。

296
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:45,520
Yeah, the 'cados are nice.

296
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:45,520
是的，'cados 很好。

297
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:46,770
Did you see this here?

297
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:46,770
你在这里看到了吗？

298
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,551
This is in a bad spot here.
This seems dangerous, right?

298
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,551
这在这里处于一个糟糕的位置。这看起来很危险，对吧？

299
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:51,004
It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.

299
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:51,004
这是一场等待发生的诉讼。

300
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:53,356
They better be careful. They might
find themselves in a lawsuit, right?

300
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:53,356
他们最好小心点。他们可能会发现自己陷入诉讼，对吧？

301
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:55,160
I could use some money, actually.

301
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:55,160
实际上，我可以用一些钱。

302
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:57,434
"My son needs some
bull#### operation."

302
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:57,434
“我儿子需要一些公牛#### 手术。”

刚刚发现我儿子需要一些公牛#### 手术。

304
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:02,426
You know what? That's going
to be a way to help him out.

304
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:02,426
你知道吗？这将是帮助他的一种方式。

305
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,465
<i>[Q] Here we go.</i>

305
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,465
[Q] 我们开始吧。

306
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:07,723
Hyup!

306
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:07,723
哎呀！

307
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:13,152
Ohhh, god!

307
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:13,152
天啊！

308
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:15,801
Ohhhh! Ohhhhh.
-Oh my god, look at the crowd.

哦！哦。-哦，天哪，看看人群。

309
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:19,566
<i>[Q] She's not even stopping the
squeezing of the 'cados.</i>

309
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:19,566
[Q] 她甚至没有停止对 'cados 的挤压。

310
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,371
She's all about that 'cado!

310
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,371
她全心全意地专注于那个 'cado！

311
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,981
You alright?
-Yeah, this is in a bad spot.

311

你还好吗？- 是的，这很糟糕。

312
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:26,637
Alright, alright. -Yeah, I mean she saw
the whole thing, this lady over here

312
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:26,637
好吧，好吧。-是的，我是说她看到了整件事，这边的这位女士

所以 Q 是我们的失败者，今天他是 “志愿服务 ”

What, did it take you 2 seconds
to come up with this one?

333

00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,611
[喃喃自语]看看这个。

393
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:55,978
<i>[Murr and Sal] Q, oh my god!</i>

393
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:55,978
[穆尔和萨尔]Q，天哪！

394
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:58,064
<i>[Joe] He's full-blown opening
a can on the table.</i>

394
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:58,064
[乔]他正在全力以赴地打开桌子上的一个罐头。

395
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,916
<i>[Sal] Oh, what is that? What is that? Corn?
[Murr] It's, uh, corn.</i>

395
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,916
[萨尔]哦，那是什么？什么？玉米？[喃喃自语]这是，呃，玉米。

396
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,213
<i>[Sal] Ugh, jellied corn, milk, ham?</i>

396
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,213
[萨尔]呃，果冻玉米、牛奶、火腿？

397
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:08,830
Dude, your ass is going to be
making a donation in a few minutes.

397
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:08,830
伙计，你的屁股几分钟后就要捐款了。

398
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:15,119
<i>[Joe, Murr, Sal] Ohhhh!</i>

398
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:15,119
[乔、穆尔、萨尔]哦！

399
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,002
Oh, but it was dinged?

399
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,002
哦，但它被叮叮当当了？

400
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:21,580
It wasn't? It was dinged.

400
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:21,580
不是吗？它被叮叮当当。

401
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:26,619
All dinged. All dinged.

401
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:26,619
全都叮叮当当。全都叮叮当当。

402
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:27,619
All dinged!

402
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:27,619
全都叮叮当当！

403
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,869
This is what we knew
would happen,

403
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,869
这就是我们知道会发生的事情，

404
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:34,158
That good people would rise up.
-Yes.

404
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:34,158
好人会起来。-是的。

405
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:37,158
And take a stand against
this piece of garbage. -Yep.

405
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:37,158
并反对这块垃圾。-是的。

406
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:39,877
Okay.

406
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:39,877
好。

407
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:43,799
<i>[Cole] Alright, let's uh...
I'm going to go talk to him.</i>

407
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:43,799
[科尔]好吧，呃......我要去和他谈谈。

408
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,463
Sir, are you eating more food?

408
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,463
先生，您吃的食物多了吗？

409
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:48,299
No. No. No.

409
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:48,299
不。不。不。

410
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:49,642
No no no no. No!

410
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:49,642
不，不，不，不。不！

411
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:50,728
What is this, then, sir?

411
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:50,728
那么，先生，这是什么呢？

412
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:51,564
The... the...

412
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:51,564
这。。。这。。。

413
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,697
Sir, you can't open the food.
-Got it.

413
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,697
先生，你不能打开食物。-明白了。

414
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:57,829
Last time. Two strikes.
Two strikes.

414
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:57,829
上次。两次打击。两次打击。

415
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:59,252
This was open before, though.

415
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:59,252
不过，这以前是开放的。

416
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:05,915
We should stop eating and we
should pack it

416
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:05,915
我们应该停止进食，我们应该打包

417
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,955
and then we can all get
out of here. -Got it.

417
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,955
然后我们都可以离开这里。-明白了。

418
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:09,963
<i>[Murr] Oh, this is tense.

419
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:11,275
<i>take it anymore!</i>

419
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:11,275
再来吧！

420
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:13,111
Brian, hi.

420
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:13,111

Thank you.

423
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:23,353
Don is the best!

423
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:23,353
Don 是最好的！

424
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:25,783
<i>[Murr] Q, these people need
to see you eat some ham.</i>

424
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:25,783
[喃喃自语]Q，这些人需要看到你吃点火腿。

425
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:28,002
<i>Can you trying opening a
ham with the can opener?</i>

425
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:28,002
您可以尝试用开罐器打开火腿吗？

426
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,080

<i>[Sal] He's pointing him out!</i>

<i>[Joe] Don's going to get Cole.</i>

<i>[Cole] Brian!
-Hey, what's going on, man?</i>

429
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,986
[科尔]布莱恩！-嘿，这是怎么回事，伙计？

430
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,377
<i>I just saw you eating more food.</i>

430

我刚刚看到你吃得更多了。

431
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:41,439
I'm not eating anything!

431
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:41,439
我什么都没吃！

432
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:43,221
Well, he just told me that you...

432

嗯，他刚才跟我说你......

[muffled over a mouth full of food]
He told you!?

433
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:44,260
[含糊不清的嘴]他告诉你的！？

434
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,260
Don!

434
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,260
唐！

435
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:49,705
Yeah.

435
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:49,705
是的。

436
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:51,869
Yeah, I hear what
you're saying, but...

436
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:51,869
是的，我听到你在说什么，但是......

437
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:56,650
Yeah.

437
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:56,650

438
00:19:58,017 --> 00:19:59,275
Hmmmm.

438
00:19:58,017 --> 00:19:59,275
嗯。

439
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,017
[Joe] Don is an angel.
[Sal We love Don.

439
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,017
[乔]唐是个天使。[Sal 我们爱 Don。

441
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,533
Is this another can of
cooked ham?

441
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,533
这是另一罐煮熟的火腿吗？

442
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:07,368
That... [stammers]

442
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:07,368
那。。。[结结巴巴]

443
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:09,291
This is your second
cooked ham can?

443
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:09,291
这是你的第二个煮熟的火腿罐头？

444
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:18,650
<i>[Sal] Oh, we got Cole laughing!</i>

444

[萨尔]哦，我们让 Cole 笑了！

445
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:21,814
<i>[Joe] Get him out.
[Murr] There you go.</i>

445
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:21,814
[乔]把他赶出去。[喃喃自语]给你。

446
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:22,971
<i>[Murr] "I'm going to volunteer
to leave."</i>

447
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:26,658
No, I volunteer to leave.
I volunteer to leave.

447
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:26,658
不，我自愿离开。我自愿离开。

448
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,822
You didn't fire
me, I quit.

448
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,822
你没有解雇我，我辞职了。

449
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,096
Q, if you're hungry, you
can take some stuff to go.

449
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,096
问：如果你饿了，你可以带一些东西带走。

450
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:32,658
<i>[Murr] Yeah, your backpack is up
there. Get your bag to leave.</i>

450
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:32,658
[喃喃自语]是的，你的背包就在那里。拿你的包离开。

451
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,697
And pack some stuff
up to go.

451
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,697
并收拾一些东西准备出发。

452
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,228
[Joe] Do a quick
round to go.

452
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,228
[乔]快速转一圈即可。

453
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:45,588
No no no no no!

453
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:45,588
不！

454
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,634
This guy's going to literally
put you in a full nelson.

454
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,634
这家伙真的会让你陷入困境。

455
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,158
Well, it's not a Board
of Health thing.

455
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,158
嗯，这不是卫生委员会的事情。

456
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:51,424
No, I'm gone.

456
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:51,424
不，我走了。

457
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,346
<i>[Murr] Oh! Run run run!</i>

457
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,346
[喃喃自语]哦！Run Run Run！

458
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,752
<i>[Joe] Out the door in shame.</i>

458
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,752
[乔]羞愧地走出了门。

459
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,564
There's the second can
of cooked ham!

459
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,564
还有第二罐煮熟的火腿！

460
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:04,252
<i>Brian! You didn't even
eat the first one!</i>

460
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:04,252
布莱恩！你甚至没有吃第一个！

461
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:07,885
That was horrible.

461
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:07,885
那太可怕了。

462
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,588
Look at how much I'm sweating.
Dude, it was so bad.

462
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,588
看看我出汗多少。伙计，这太糟糕了。

463
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:16,291
Wow.
-It was so nerve-racking.

463
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:16,291
哇。-这太伤脑筋了。

464
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,666
Wow. So Q "ate it" in
tonight's punishment

464
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,666
哇。所以 Q 在今晚的惩罚中“吃了”

465
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,502
but we're going to
"donate" some bonus footage

465
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,502
但我们将“捐赠”一些额外的素材

466
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:22,111
and a behind-the-scenes
look at how it happened.

466
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:22,111
以及幕后花絮，看看它是如何发生的。

467
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:22,689
Eat up!

467
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:22,689
吃光！

468
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,588
I got a ham in my teeth.
I got to go brush.

468
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,588
我的牙齿里有一根火腿。我得去刷牙。

469
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:25,705
Yeah. Go, go.

469
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:25,705
是的。走吧，走吧。

470
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,010
That was terrible!

470
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,010
太可怕了！

471
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:29,830
Murr, this is a, this is
a weird one today, huh?

471
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:29,830
喃喃，这是，今天很奇怪，是吧？

472
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,721
How do you mean?
-This punishment is unlike...

472
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,721
你是什么意思？- 这种惩罚不像......

473
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:32,916
You, you are tall!

473
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:32,916
你，你个子高啊！

474
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:34,978
This is me without shoes.
You've got shoes on, admittedly.

474
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:34,978
这就是没有鞋子的我。诚然，你已经穿上了鞋子。

475
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,697
But watch me, watch
me without shoes.

475
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,697
但是看着我，看着我没穿鞋。

476
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:38,580
Oh.

476
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:38,580
哦。

477
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:41,010
See?
-Yeah. He's got lifts.

477
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:41,010
看？-是的。他有电梯。

478
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,666
This is tough for you
because I know that you

478
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,666
这对你来说很艰难，因为我知道你

479
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:44,072
you know, you donated
your time

479
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:44,072
你知道，你贡献了你的时间

480
00:21:44,097 --> 00:21:45,135
as a firefighter.

480
00:21:44,097 --> 00:21:45,135
作为一名消防员。

481
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,369
I mean, I guess
you got paid for it.

481
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,369
我的意思是，我猜你已经为此付出了代价。

482
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:47,689
Yeah.
-But you're a hero

482
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:47,689
是的。- 但你是个英雄

483
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:49,494
and then today you have
to kind of be a "zero".

483
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:49,494
然后今天你必须成为 “零”。

484
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,478
Yeah, but I'm more used to
being a "zero" than a hero.

484
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,478
是的，但我更习惯于成为“零”而不是英雄。

485
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:53,971
<i>That's not true.</i>

485
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:53,971
那不是真的。

486
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:57,916
Uh, I just like to help, man.

486
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:57,916
呃，我就是想帮忙，伙计。

487
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,369
Yeah. What did you rat me
out on the corn for?

487
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,369
是的。你把我赶出去干什么？

488
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:04,252
Well, I wouldn't have to lie
if you didn't point it out.

488
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:04,252
好吧，如果你不指出来，我就不必撒谎。

489
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:06,267
Do you know the
challenge where Joe

489
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:06,267
你知道乔的挑战在哪里

490
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,353
is... we're working in
Organic Avenue?

490
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,353
是。。。我们在 Organic Avenue 工作？

491
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:09,877
<i>Yeah.</i>
-And, the juice place?

491
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:09,877
是的。- 还有果汁店？

492
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:11,346
And Joe keeps
drinking the milk

492
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:11,346
乔继续喝牛奶

493
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,510
out of the fridge?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

493
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,510
从冰箱里出来了？-是的。

494
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:14,346
That's essentially
what this is, worse.

494
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:14,346
这基本上就是更糟糕的。

495
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:16,697
People have donated their
time; they've donated food.

495
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:16,697
人们贡献了他们的时间;他们捐赠了食物。

496
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:19,978
And Q is wasting their
time and eating their food.

496
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:19,978
而 Q 正在浪费他们的时间并吃他们的食物。

497
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:21,439
Beautiful.

497
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:21,439
美丽。

498
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,650
Oh, I know the show.

498
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,650
哦，我知道这个节目。

499
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:26,791
It says "cooked ham",
does that mean

499
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:26,791
上面写着 “cooked ham”，这是什么意思

500
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,189
You can't, you can't eat it
room temperature?

500
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,189
你不能，你不能在室温下吃吗？

501
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,338
Let's find out.

501
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,338
让我们来了解一下。

502
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:36,142
Let's find out, then.

502
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:36,142
那么，让我们来了解一下。

503
00:22:37,502 --> 00:22:38,619
Any bread in here?

503
00:22:37,502 --> 00:22:38,619
这里有面包吗？

504
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:44,346
Everything about that
was horrible.

504
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:44,346
一切都很可怕。

505
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:46,728
Everybody hated me
within 2 seconds. -I know.

505
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:46,728
每个人都在 2 秒钟内讨厌我。-我知道。

506
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:48,338
I'm not used to, like, that.

506
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:48,338
我不习惯，就像这样。

507
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:50,408
It's so different. They're
the nicest people

507
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:50,408
这太不同了。他们是最好的人

508
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:51,658
for donating their time.

508
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:51,658
贡献他们的时间。

509
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,416
And, and you're
the worst person.

509
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,416
而且，你是最糟糕的人。

510
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:55,244
Peanut butter, yeah!

510
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:55,244
花生酱，是的！

511
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:56,846
<i>[Sal] That's one you
won't see him eat.</i>

511
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:56,846
[萨尔]那是你不会看到他吃的。

512
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:58,571
Q's deathly allergic to it.

512
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:58,571
Q 对它过敏得要命。

513
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:00,431
No, that's not true.
-He just doesn't like it.

513
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:00,431
不，那不是真的。- 他就是不喜欢。

514
00:23:01,135 --> 00:23:02,783
"He'll die"? "He'll die"?!

514
00:23:01,135 --> 00:23:02,783
“他会死”？“他会死的”？！

515
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:05,025
[stammers] like, his throat, right?

515
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:05,025
[结结巴巴地] 比如，他的喉咙，对吧？

516
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,580
Peanut butter gives me
a big headache

516
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,580
花生酱让我头疼不已

517
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:10,244
So, I can guarantee none of these
are dinged. You know what I mean?

517
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:10,244
所以，我可以保证这些都没有被打砸。你知道我的意思？

518
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:11,869
<i>[Joe] Look at this guy!</i>

518
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:11,869
[乔]看看这家伙！

519
00:23:14,197 --> 00:23:16,314
Wow. And Cole! Cole
was reaming into you.

519
00:23:14,197 --> 00:23:16,314
哇。还有科尔！科尔正在向你敞口。

520
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:17,846
What was up with Cole, man?

520
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:17,846
科尔怎么了，伙计？

521
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:19,775
Why would Cole come
at me like that?

521
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:19,775
为什么科尔会这样冲我呢？

522
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,150
Uh, are you eating
more food?

522
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,150
呃，你吃的食物多了吗？

523
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,861
<i>No.
-And don't tell me it was dinged.</i>

523
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,861
不。- 别告诉我它有叮当声。

524
00:23:22,963 --> 00:23:25,166
This is donations that
we need for churches

524
00:23:22,963 --> 00:23:25,166
这是我们教会需要的捐款

525
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:26,830
and for people in need.
-No, I get it.

525
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:26,830
以及为有需要的人服务。- 不，我明白了。

526
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:27,743
I didn't open anything new.

526
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:27,743
我没有打开任何新的东西。

527
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:29,744
Q is kind of like your boss.
Did it feel good to

527
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:29,744
Q 有点像你的老板。感觉好吗

528
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:31,080
Very much like my boss.

528
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:31,080
很像我的老板。

529
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,502
Right. Did it feel good? Were
you, like, letting loose on him?

529
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,502
右。感觉好吗？你是不是，对他放纵了？

530
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:36,025
Yeah, yeah. It was finally
I was protected.

530
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:36,025
是的。我终于得到了保护。

531
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,908
I was allowed to.

531
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,908
我被允许这样做。

532
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,650
<i>[Sal] Well, let's keep cutting
back to the clip where you laugh.</i>

532
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,650
[萨尔]好吧，让我们继续切回你笑的片段。

533
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:40,221
This is your second
cooked ham can?

533
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:40,221
这是你的第二个煮熟的火腿罐头？

534
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:47,049
We got Cole laughing!

534
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:47,049
我们让 Cole 笑了起来！

535
00:23:49,822 --> 00:23:51,588
[talking over each other]

535
00:23:49,822 --> 00:23:51,588
[互相交谈]

536
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:54,088
####! ####! Ohhh.
Son of a...

536
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:54,088
####!####!哦。一个的儿子...

537
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:55,221
I hate him!

537
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:55,221
我恨他！

538
00:23:55,246 --> 00:23:56,994
<i>[Sal] White, brand new sneakers.</i>

538
00:23:55,246 --> 00:23:56,994
[萨尔]白色全新运动鞋。

539
00:23:57,088 --> 00:23:58,242
It's dripping!

539
00:23:57,088 --> 00:23:58,242
它在滴水！

540
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:00,353
White, brand new. White
and brand new sneakers.

540
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:00,353
白色，全新。白色和全新的运动鞋。

541
00:24:00,494 --> 00:24:02,861
It's dripping out of his shoe!

541
00:24:00,494 --> 00:24:02,861
它从他的鞋子里滴下来了！

542
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:04,525
I mean, this is next
level, guys.

542
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:04,525
我的意思是，这是下一个级别，伙计们。

543
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,619
What are we going
to do about this?

543
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,619
我们该怎么办？

544
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:09,791
Murray just dropped a
full iced tea on Sal.

544
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:09,791
Murray 刚刚给 Sal 倒了一整杯冰茶。

545
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:12,830
I mean, literally, the
inside of my shoe

545
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:12,830
我的意思是，字面意思，就是我鞋子的内侧

546
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:14,947
has 4 ounces of peach tea in it.

546
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:14,947
里面有 4 盎司的桃茶。

547
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:16,799
<i>I'm sorry, buddy.
It was an accident.</i>

547
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:16,799
对不起，伙计。这是个意外。

548
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:19,416
But, how is it that you have
an accident every day, though?

548
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:19,416
但是，您为什么每天都会发生事故呢？

549
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,799
You have ruined 90
percent of my shoes.

549
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,799
你毁了我 90% 的鞋子。

550
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:23,096
-Yeah?
-90 percent.

550
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:23,096
-是的？-90%。

551
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,330
But nobody else's shoes!
Look around!

551
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,330
但没有其他人的鞋子！睤！

552
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:28,908
There's 60 people in here!

552
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:28,908
这里有 60 个人！

553
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:31,322
I'll take it.
-No one else's shoes have been affected!

553
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:31,322
我会接受的。- 没有其他人的鞋子受到影响！

554
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:32,986
I'll take it.
-This is a #### conspiracy.

554
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:32,986
我会接受的。- 这是一个 #### 阴谋。

555
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:34,533
I'll take it, because I
thought you were going to say

555
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:34,533
我接受它，因为我以为你会说

556
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,055
"I've ruined 90
percent of your life".

556
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,055
“我毁了你 90% 的生活”。

557
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,054
That's what I thought you were
going to say. I'll take the shoes.

557
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,054
我以为你会这么说。我来拿鞋子。
