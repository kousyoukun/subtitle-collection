<i>Why is Murr shaking things up?</i>

2
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:14,813
为什么 Murr 要改变现状？

3
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:16,984
You're not going to be scared at all
if it does anything, right?

3
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:16,984
如果它做任何事情，你根本不会害怕，对吧？

4
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:19,531
<i>What's got Joe striking a pose?</i>

<i>And which losing Joker

00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,117
而哪个输了的小丑将无法拉上拉链

00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:26,086
<i>in tonight's outspoken punishment?</i>

00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:26,086
在今晚直言不讳的惩罚中？

00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:27,352
Sorry, do you have a question?

8
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:27,352
对不起，您有问题吗？

9

00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,656
Hey, mustache, what's up?

10
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,656
嘿，小胡子，怎么了？

11
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:36,828
I want my mommy!

11

我要我的妈妈！

12
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,641
I will never forgive you!

12
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,641
我永远不会原谅你！

<i>[Murr] Like a bosssssss!</i>

[喃喃自语]就像一个老板一样！

15
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,391
We're here at my favorite
theme park in the world:

15
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,391
我们来到了世界上我最喜欢的主题公园：

16
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,195
Universal Orlando Resort, working

16
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,195
奥兰多环球影城度假村 （Universal Orlando Resort），正在运营

17
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,195
on their brand new Fast &
Furious Supercharged ride.

17
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,195
在他们全新的速度与激情增压骑行中。

18
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:58,109
While posing as employees, we're
going to have to do and say

18
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:58,109
在冒充员工时，我们将不得不做和说

19
00:00:58,134 --> 00:00:59,617
whatever the other guys
tell us to.

19
00:00:58,134 --> 00:00:59,617
其他人告诉我们做什么。

20
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,141
And today, every single refusal

20
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,141
而今天，每一次拒绝

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,569
counts as a thumbs down.

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,569
算作竖起大拇指。

22
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:05,406
Thumbs downs are going
to come fast and furious.

22
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:05,406
大拇指反对会来得又快又猛。

23
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:12,156
I feel like I'm hanging out in
Dom Toretto's garage.

23
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:12,156
我感觉自己就像在 Dom Toretto 的车库里闲逛。

24
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,750
We are big Fast & Furious
fans here. Big.

24
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,750
我们是这里的大速度与激情粉丝。大。

25
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:17,266
<i>[Sal] If you're here, you
know about the family.</i>

[萨尔]如果你在这里，你就会了解这个家庭。

26
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,656
And the family's ride or die.

26
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,656
而这个家庭要么生死。

27
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:19,539
Always ride or die.

27
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:19,539
永远骑车或死亡。

28
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:21,828
So, let's test how "ride
or die" people are.

28
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:21,828
那么，让我们测试一下人们的 “ride or die” 是如何的。

29
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:22,984
Excuse me.

29
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:22,984
对不起。

30
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:25,281
I'm here to find out how
"ride or die" are you?

30
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:25,281
我来这里是为了了解你有多 “ride or die” ？

31
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,469
Where you guys from?

31
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,469
你们来自哪里？

32
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:29,047
Ohh! That's ride or die!

32
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:29,047
哦！那就是 ride or die！

33
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:30,469
Leprechauns are ride or die.

33
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:30,469
妖精要么骑要么死。

34
00:01:30,494 --> 00:01:31,430
You know what's lep...

34

你知道什么是 lep......

35
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:32,921
You know what's ride or die?

你知道什么是 ride or die吗？

36
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:34,500
Leprechauns.
Leprechauns are ride or die.

36
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:34,500
妖精。妖精要么骑要么死。

37
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:36,609
[vocalizes a stereotypical Irish tune] right?

37
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:36,609
[唱出刻板的爱尔兰曲调]对吧？

38
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,797
So I see you have bangs coming
out of the front of your cap there?

38
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,797
所以我看到你的帽子前面有刘海吗？

39
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,234
You got sunglasses indoors.

39
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,234
你在室内有太阳镜。

40
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,570
[Q clicks tongue] Like myself.

40

[Q 咔嚓舌头]就像我自己一样。

41
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,445
That's a double ride
or die, right there.

41
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,445
那是双倍骑行或死亡，就在那里。

42
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,344
You got a "Clark Kent curl" going.

42
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,344
你有一个 “克拉克肯特卷曲” 正在进行。

43

Do i? <i>-[Sal] Yeah.</i>

I wish I had the cape.

我希望我有那件斗篷。

47
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:02,693
How you doing? You guys
having fun today?

47

你好吗？你们今天玩得开心吗？

48
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,326
Say to the girl:
"Are you with him?"

48
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,326
对女孩说：“你和他在一起吗？

“真的？！”

51
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:11,506
What are you, is the machine
okay? You checking the machine?

51
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:11,506
你是什么，机器还好吗？你检查机器吗？

You having a good time?
-Yeah.

00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:19,808
你知道，你也可能失去这顶帽子。

163
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,823
It, you see, it does all that.

163
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,823
你看，它做到了这一切。

164
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,401
You're going to be okay, right?
You're going to be a big man?

164
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,401
你会没事的，对吧？你会成为一个大男人吗？

165
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,354
Go one more time, one more
time! Go in hard!

165
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,354
再来一次，再来一次！努力进去！

166
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,800
You going to be okay?
You going to... -Yup.

166
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,800
你会没事的吗？你要...-是的。

167
00:06:27,948 --> 00:06:29,370
Go have fun with Fast
& Furious!

167
00:06:27,948 --> 00:06:29,370
快来和Fast & Furious一起玩吧！

168
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,464
<i>[Joe] There's a fella

<i>"Does this one speak English?"</i>

169

00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:36,362
Oh, come on.

170
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:36,362
拜托。

171

<i>[Q] Alright. See the teenager
with no sleeves and, uh, blonde hair?</i>

172

[Q] 好的。看到那个没有袖子、金发的少年了吗？

173
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:43,472
Yeah. Uh, yes.
Up here? Yeah.

173

是的。呃，是的。在这儿？是的。

174
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,151
Just ask him if he
needs to "go to potty".

174
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,151
问他是否需要 “去如厕”。

175
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:47,205
[quietly] Come on.

175
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:47,205
[悄悄地]加油。

176
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:49,893
You need to go potty?

176
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:49,893
你需要上厕所吗？

177
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,011
No? Great. Okay.

177
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,011
不？伟大。好。

178
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:51,995
"Are you sure?"

178
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:51,995
“你确定吗？”

179
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:53,222
Are you sure?

179
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:53,222
是否确定？

180
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:55,128
Because, don't ask me
five minutes later.

180
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:55,128
因为，不要在五分钟后问我。

181
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,472
"When was the last
time you pottied?"

181
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,472
“你上次上厕所是什么时候？”

182
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,159
When's the last time
you pottied?

182
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,159
你上一次上厕所是什么时候？

183
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:02,956
<i>[Joe] 1 or 2?</i>

185
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,768
"How'd you get in here
with those pythons"?

185
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,768
“你是怎么带着那些蟒蛇进来的”？

186
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,925
"They let you into the park
with those garden snakes?"

186
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,925
“他们让你和那些花园蛇一起进公园？”

187
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,534
This is a "Lose-A-Palooza"?

187
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,534
这是“Lose-A-Palooza”？

188
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:23,214
"Lose-A-Palooza".
-That's also Murray's New Year's Eve party.

188
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:23,214
“Lose-A-Palooza”。- 这也是 Murray 的除夕派对。

189
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,823
"How many people in
your party, sir?"

“先生，您一行有多少人？”

190

How many people are in your party?
-Two.

你的队伍里有多少人？-二。

191

It's just the two of you?
-Yeah.

191
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,214
就你们两个人？-是的。

It's just you and your daughter?
-Yeah.

192

00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:47,753
Oh, wow!

198
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:47,753
哦，哇！

199
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:50,425
I got to tell you.
Your daughter seems...

199
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:50,425
我得告诉你。你的女儿看起来......

200
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,370
adorable.
-Oh, thank you.

<i>[Sal] Another loss!</i>

[萨尔]又一次失利！

202
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:57,112
M-M-My turn was fast.
And I am furious.

202
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:57,112
M-M-轮到我的时候很快。我很生气。

203
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:04,299
<i>All the guys got dinged up, but Murr
and Q are in the fast lane to Loserville.</i>

所有的人都被搞砸了，但 Murr 和 Q 正处于通往 Loserville 的快车道上。

204
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,471
Today we're in the park,
taking photos of strangers

204
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,471
今天我们在公园里，为陌生人拍照

205
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:09,245
and then asking them their permission

205
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:09,245
然后征求他们的许可

206
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,471
to post them on our personal
Instagram accounts.

206
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,471
将它们发布到我们的个人 Instagram 帐户上。

207
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,666
The catch is, the other guys
will be providing

207
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,666
问题是，其他人将提供

208
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:15,916
and awkward caption that
has to go along

208
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:15,916
和尴尬的标题，这不得不配合

209
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:17,010
with that photo.

209
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:17,010
与那张照片。

210
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:19,041
If the stranger doesn't let
you post the picture

210
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:19,041
如果陌生人不让你发布照片

211
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,901
and that caption, you lose.

211
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,901
而那个标题，你输了。

212
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:23,651
And, if you lose, you have to
post an embarrasing

212
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:23,651
而且，如果你输了，你必须发布一个尴尬的

213
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:26,416
selfie using that same caption.

213
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:26,416
使用相同标题的自拍。

214
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:29,971
[all grimacing] Cheeeese.

214
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:29,971
[全都做了个鬼脸]Cheeeese 的。

<i>[Q] Yeah, there they are.
[Murr] Yeah, there's the jorts.</i>

<i>[Q] Do you need use to even
tell you what it's going to be, or...?</i>

219
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:45,807
[Q] 你是否需要告诉你它会是什么，或者......？

220

<i>[Q] Okay. Sal, uh...</i>

[Q] 好的。萨尔，呃......

221

Go ahead and put, uh,

去吧，呃，“Jorts for days”。

222

For anybody at home
that doesn't know

对于任何在家中不知道的人

"Jorts" are jeans, shorts...

223
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,245
“Jorts”是牛仔裤、短裤......

224

[Q and Joe together] Jorts.

标签 “God bless”。

229
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:13,799
Making fun of my, uh,
patented hashtag?

229
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:13,799
取笑我的，呃，专利标签？

230
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,010
Okay.

230
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,010
好。

231
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,463
Get in there. Because those jorts
were made for walking.

231
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,463
进去。因为那些 jorts 是为走路而设计的。

232
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:20,080
<i>[Murr] Alright, Sally. If he
let's you post that photo, you win.</i>

[喃喃自语]好的，莎莉。如果他让你发布那张照片，你就赢了。

233
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:22,664
And if he doesn't, you put
up a bad selfie.

233
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:22,664
如果他没有，你就会拍一张糟糕的自拍。

<i>[Murr] He we go.</i>

凉。我可以标记您吗？

237
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:31,703
Why? -I-I-was... I had a picture
I was going to post.

#CargoShorts

321
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:34,281
You know, ####?

321
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:34,281
你知道吗，####？

322
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:36,602
"What does it mean!"

322
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:36,602
“这是什么意思！”

323
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:38,250
You know like... eh...

323
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:38,250
你知道的......啊。。。

324
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:39,156
Like a ####.

324
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:39,156
就像 ####。

325
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:41,328
Yeah, like a pubic hair
####. Yeah.

325
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:41,328
是的，就像####。是的。

326
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:43,742
Now he's got to explain!

326
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:43,742
现在他必须解释！

327
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:49,765
So for this one, I put
"def gots a ####".

327
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:49,765
所以对于这个，我把 “def gots a ####”放在 “这个 上面。

328
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:52,539
You know like... eh...
like a ####.

328
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:52,539
你知道的......啊。。。就像 #### 一样。

329
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:55,781
Yeah, like a pubic hair
####. Yeah.

329
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:55,781
是的，就像####。是的。

330
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:58,044
Now he's got to explain!

330
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:58,044
现在他必须解释！

331
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,966
I can, I can tell because
everybody knows

331
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,966
我可以，我能说出来，因为大家都知道

332
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:01,794
for me and my followers.
They know I gots a ####.

332
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:01,794
对我和我的追随者来说。他们知道我得到了 ####。

333
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:03,490
Like, I thought you were
one of my kindred spirits.

333
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:03,490
就像，我以为你是我的志同道合者之一。

334
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,076
Oh.
-That def gots a ####.

334
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,076
哦。- 那个 def 得到了 ####。

335
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:06,177
Yeah.

335
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:06,177
是的。

336
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:10,411
Uh, so, I was going to
post that. Is that cool?

336
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:10,411
呃，所以，我打算发布它。这很酷吗？

337
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,833
Do you not like the picture?
Is that what the issue is?

337
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,833
你不喜欢这张照片吗？这就是问题所在吗？

338
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:16,451
Got it.

338
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:16,451
明白了。

339
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:18,872
What was your name?
-Kieran.

339
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:18,872
你叫什么名字？-基兰。

340
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,120
Kieran? Joe.
Good to see you, pal.

340
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,120
基兰？乔。很高兴见到你，伙计。

341
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:21,198
Take care, bud.

341
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:21,198
小心点，伙计。

342
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:23,066
It's all tasteful pictures,
though. The whole time.

342
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:23,066
不过，这些都是有品位的照片。一直以来。

343
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:24,761
<i>Mostly of the ####.</i>

343
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:24,761
主要是 ####。

344
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:25,745
<i>[Q] "My ####"</i>

344
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:25,745
[Q] “我的 ####”

345
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,441
My ####, specifically.

345
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,441
特别是我的 ####。

346
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:33,620
Joe. I want you to take a p...
a selfie of your crotch.

346
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:33,620
乔。我想让你吃点...你的胯部自拍。

347
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,816
<i>[Q] And this is New York City. No one
is even giving him a second glance.</i>

347
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,816
[Q] 这里是纽约市。甚至没有人多看他一眼。

348
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,589
This is why I love living in New
York. Nobody cares.

348
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,589
这就是我喜欢住在纽约的原因。没人在乎。

349
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,105
<i>[Q] I can't wait to see this.</i>

349
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,105
[Q] 我迫不及待地想看到这个。

350
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,144
<i>[Joe] Just get a picture
of this guy.</i>

350
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,144
[乔]就拍张这家伙的照片吧。

351
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:55,300
[camera snap]

351
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:55,300
[相机抓拍]

352
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:56,347
<i>[Joe] Okay, got it.</i>

352
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:56,347
[乔]好的，明白了。

353
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:58,105
<i>[Murr] Alright, go on to
Instagram, buddy.</i>

353
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:58,105
[喃喃自语]好了，继续 Instagram，伙计。

354
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:00,488
"Hootie let himself go"

354
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:00,488
“Hootie 放飞自我”

355
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:03,980
<i>[Murr] Hootie!</i>

355
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:03,980
[喃喃自语]哎呀！

356
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:05,597
<i>[Q] Hootie let himself go?</i>

356
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:05,597
[Q] Hootie 放飞自我？

357
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:06,417
<i>[Sal laughing] Yeah.</i>

357
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:06,417
[Sal 笑]是的。

358
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:09,363
Okay. By the way, my phone
autocorrects "Hootie" to "booty".

358
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:09,363
好。顺便说一句，我的手机会自动将“Hootie”更正为“booty”。

359
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,433
Tells you about my life.

359
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,433
告诉你我的生活。

360
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,315
<i>[Joe] Yeah we know
what you're texting.</i>

360
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,315
[乔]是的，我们知道你在发什么短信。

361
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,746
Well, you know what?
Either one works.

361
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,746
嗯，你知道吗？任何一个都有效。

362
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,902
<i>[Sal laughing] Okay,
that wasn't too obvious.</i>

362
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,902
[Sal 笑]好吧，这并不太明显。

363
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,339
You put the coffee on
his knee almost.

363
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,339
你几乎把咖啡放在他的膝盖上。

364
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,417
<i>[Murr] The coffee cup is our
microphone. [Joe] Yeah.</i>

364
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,417
[喃喃自语]咖啡杯是我们的麦克风。[乔]是的。

365
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:28,121
<i>[Joe] Alright, well peace out!</i>

365
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:28,121
[乔]好了，平安！

366
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:30,503
Excuse me!

366
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:30,503
对不起！

367
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,863
Sir! Is this your coffee?

367
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,863
先生！这是你的咖啡吗？

368
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:34,800
Oh. Would you...

368
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:34,800
哦。你会...

369
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:36,722
What's your Instagram?

369
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:36,722
你的 Instagram 是什么？

370
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:39,003
Oh. I do.

370
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:39,003
哦。我愿意。

371
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,894
Because what I do, is I
like to get silly.

371
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,894
因为我所做的，就是我喜欢变得愚蠢。

372
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,355
Right, right.

372
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,355
对，对。

373
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,480
You know what I mean? I take
pictures and I put funny captions.

373
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,480
你知道我的意思？我拍照并放置有趣的标题。

374
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:45,331
And I saw you
listening to music.

374
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:45,331
我看到你在听音乐。

375
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:46,597
And, you know, I
love music.

375
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:46,597
而且，你知道，我喜欢音乐。

376
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:48,339
I'm a big <i>Hootie and
the Blowfish</i> fan. -Okay

376
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:48,339
我是 Hootie and the Blowfish 的忠实粉丝。-好

377
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:49,863
Anyway, neither here nor there.

377
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:49,863
无论如何，既不在这里也不在那里。

378
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,949
Uh, I took a picture of you

378
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,949
呃，我给你拍了一张照片

379
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:54,246
looking at your--your iPhone there

379
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:54,246
看着你的——你的 iPhone 在那儿

380
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,785
and I wrote, uh,
"Hootie let himself go".

380
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,785
我写道，呃，“Hootie let yourself go”。

381
00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:59,308
Uh, but of course, I would
never put that out without

381
00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:59,308
呃，但当然，如果没有

382
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:01,081
without your permission,
because

382
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:01,081
未经您的许可，因为

383
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,503
I respect people's privacy.

383
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,503
我尊重人们的隐私。

384
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,527
Ohh!

384
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,527
哦！

385
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:08,238
Sweet. Could you hit that share for me?

385
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:08,238
甜。您能帮我打中那个份额吗？

386
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,784
Oh! Wow!

386
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,784
哦！哇！

387
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:13,026
I didn't see that one coming.

387
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:13,026
我没看到那个会来。

388
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:13,847
Thank you so much.

388
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:13,847
非常感谢。

389
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:14,722
No, no problem.

389
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:14,722
不，没问题。

390
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,777
You want to go get a drink?

390
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,777
你想去喝一杯吗？

391
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:16,777
Ah, maybe later.

391
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:16,777
啊，也许以后。

392
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:18,214
You sure? -Yeah, I'm kinda
waiting for somebody.

392
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:18,214
你确定？-是的，我有点在等人。

393
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,464
Oh, okay. Really?
-That's why. Yeah.

393
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,464
哦，好吧。真？- 这就是为什么。是的。

394
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:20,652
Because <i>I Only Wanna
Be With You</i>

394
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:20,652
因为我只想和你在一起

395
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,942
<i>Joe and Murr couldn't get an upload</i>

395
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,942
Joe 和 Murr 无法上传

396
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,411
<i>so Murr is the #Loser.</i>

396
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,411
所以 Murr 是 #Loser。

397
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:30,645
Alright, Murr!

397
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:30,645
好吧，Murr！

398
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,981
Murray is our big loser.

398
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,981
穆雷是我们最大的输家。

399
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,535
That's right. And today
we're at Tumblr,

399
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,535
没错。今天我们来到 Tumblr，

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,841
and the CEO is giving
their weekly meeting

400
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,841
首席执行官正在召开他们的每周会议

401
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:37,934
and Murray, you are
a new hire

401
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:37,934
Murray，您是新员工

402
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,012
very hip and young

402
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,012
非常时髦和年轻

403
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,997
and you are going to
heckle the whole thing.

403
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,997
而你要对整件事嘲笑。

404
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,168
<i>[Joe] Yes.</i>
-Oh come on.

404
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,168
[乔]是的。-拜托。

405
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,567
Just before we
get rolling here

405
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,567
就在我们开始之前

406
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:47,091
I would love it
if this week

406
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:47,091
如果本周

407
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,380
<i>[Sal] The CEO is the only one in the room
that knows. He gave us permission</i>

407
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,380
[萨尔]CEO 是房间里唯一知道的人。他允许我们

408
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:50,919
<i>to film with Tumblr.</i>

408
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:50,919
与 Tumblr 一起拍摄。

409
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,286
Murray does not know that.

409
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:52,286
Murray 不知道这一点。

410
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,169
<i>...intern experience.</i>

410
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,169

411
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,677
Beyza. Come on up.

411
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,677
贝扎。来吧。

412
00:15:55,778 --> 00:15:57,622
[applause and cheering]

412
00:15:55,778 --> 00:15:57,622
[掌声和欢呼]

413
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:58,973
<i>[Q] Here we go.</i>

413
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:58,973
[Q] 我们开始吧。

414
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,583
I'm originally
from Turkey.

414
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,583
我来自土耳其。

415
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,387
And I've been working
on iOS Core team.

415
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,387
我一直在 iOS Core 团队工作。

416
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:05,575
Yell "like a boss".

416
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:05,575
大喊“像个老板一样”。

417
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,317
<i>It was amazing,
it was wicked.</i>

417
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,317
这太神奇了，太邪恶了。

418
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:11,370
<i>I organized everything...</i>
Like a boss!

418
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:11,370
我把一切都安排好了......像个老板一样！

419
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,885
Yeah!
[cheering and applause]

419
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,885
是的！[欢呼和掌声]

420
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:19,940
<i>[Joe] Yell "like a boss" again.</i>

420
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:19,940
[乔]再次大喊“像老板一样”。

421
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,940
More obnoxious though.
Go "bouse".

421
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,940
不过更令人讨厌。去 “bouse”。

422
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,385
<i>I had meetings
with other teams</i>

422
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,385
我与其他团队开会

423
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:26,307
so it was really great.

423
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:26,307
所以这真的很棒。

424
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:27,862
Like a "bouse"!

424
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:27,862
就像一个“bouse”！

425
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:28,987
[awkward silence]

425
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:28,987
[尴尬的沉默]

426
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,221
No claps! No claps this time!

426
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,221
不要鼓掌！这次没有鼓掌！

427
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:36,916
Before I start anything about
my project, I needed to plan it.

427
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:36,916
在我开始我的项目之前，我需要计划它。

You're Jeff the "BOUSE"

481
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:40,085
你是 Jeff the “BOUSE”

482
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:43,312
Okay.

482
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:43,312
好。

483
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,320
<i>[Joe] Look at him! He's
shushing him like a toddler.</i>

483
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,320
[乔]看看他！他像个蹒跚学步的孩子一样嘘嘘他。

484
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:48,273
<i>[Murr] What's that?</i>

484
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:48,273
[喃喃自语]什么？

485
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:53,249
Relax, man. It's casual.

485
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:53,249
放松点，伙计。这很随意。

486
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,140
Just mumble "Tumblr
police" under your breath.

486
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,140
就低声喃喃地说“Tumblr 警察”。

487
00:18:57,406 --> 00:18:58,585
[quietly] Tumblr police.

487
00:18:57,406 --> 00:18:58,585
[悄悄地]Tumblr 警察。

488
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:02,999
He's so good
at being a dick.

488
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:02,999
他太擅长当鸡巴了。

489
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,687
Shuqi, come on up.

489
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,687
舒淇，上来吧。

490
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:08,023
<i>I mean, who doesn't come up?</i>
"Who doesn't come up in this meeting?"

490
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:08,023
我的意思是，谁不上来呢？“谁不参加这次会议？”

491
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,265
I mean, who doesn't come up?

491
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,265
我的意思是，谁不上来呢？

492
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:11,968
Seems like the whole
company's coming up.

492
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:11,968
似乎整个公司都要起来了。

493
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,687
<i>[CEO] Reminder, Briana is on
Slack if you have any...</i>

493
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,687
[首席执行官]提醒一下，Briana 在 Slack 上，如果您有任何...

494
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,656
"Participation trophy
for everybody."

494
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,656
“每个人的参与奖杯。”

495
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:19,679
It's like a participation trophy.

495
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:19,679
这就像一个参与奖杯。

496
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,406
Shuqi, tell us about your
experience this summer.

496
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,406
Shuqi，跟我们说说你今年夏天的经历吧。

497
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,710
"Shuqi shook-a now"

497
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,710
“舒淇摇了一摇”

498
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:32,390
Hello, everyone.

498
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:32,390
大家好。

499
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:33,757
Shuqi shook-a now!

499
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:33,757
舒淇摇了摇——现在！

500
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:36,406
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you zip it

500
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:36,406
嘿，我有个主意。你为什么不拉上拉链

501
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,984
until he's finished?
Okay? Thanks.

501
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,984
直到他结束？好？谢谢。

502
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:41,585
<i>[Q] Oooh.
[Sal] Oh my god.</i>

502
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:41,585
[Q] 噢。[萨尔]哦，我的上帝。

503
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,997
Did you see his face?
He went like this.

503
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,997
你看到他的脸了吗？他就这样走了。

504
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,919
<i>[Q] They're on the IM
calling for security.</i>

504
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,919
[Q] 他们在 IM 上呼吁安全。

505
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:55,708
<i>[Q] All the employees use
an i-interpersonal IM</i>

505
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:55,708
[Q] 所有员工都使用 i-interpersonal IM

506
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,708
<i>called Slack. And they're
on it calling for</i>

506
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,708
称为 Slack。他们正在呼吁

507
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,169
<i>security to come get him out.</i>

507
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,169
保安来把他救出来。

508
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:01,942
So, Murr, just say "I'm on Slack too,
I can see what you guys are doing."

508
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:01,942
所以，Murr，就说“我也在 Slack 上，我可以看到你们在做什么。

509
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:04,958
I'm on Slack too. I know
what you guys are doing.

509
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:04,958
我也在 Slack 上。我知道你们在做什么。

510
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:13,716
<i>[Joe] He put the phone away!</i>

510
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:13,716
[乔]他把电话收起来了！

511
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:15,880
We have a special surprise for you all.

511
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:15,880
我们有一个特别的惊喜要给大家。

512
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:17,622
We just found out a
little while ago

512
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:17,622
我们刚才才发现

513
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,552
how big a fan they
are of Guy Fieri.

513
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,552
他们是多么忠实的 Guy Fieri 粉丝。

514
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:22,567
It turns out, Joe has
his contact info

514
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:22,567
事实证明，乔有他的联系信息

515
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:24,661
and we called Guy
and asked him to call in.

515
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:24,661
我们打电话给 Guy 并让他打电话。

516
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:29,262
[cheering and applause]

516
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:29,262
[欢呼和掌声]

517
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:30,966
Is that Guy Fieri?

517
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:30,966
那是 Guy Fieri 吗？

518
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:35,419
Hey everybody in Flavortown,
hope you're having a good summer.

518
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:35,419
嘿，Flavortown 的每个人，希望您度过了一个愉快的夏天。

519
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,599

00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,599
[欢呼]

520
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:39,497
Yell "Guy Fieri
you suck"

520
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:39,497
大喊“Guy Fieri，你很烂”

521
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:43,372
By the way, you are huge on Tumblr.
I don't know if you knew that or not.

521
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:43,372
顺便说一句，你在 Tumblr 上很受欢迎。我不知道你是否知道。

522
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,888
<i>Our team really loves you.
a lot. We have a big project...</i>

522
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,888
我们的团队真的很爱您。好多。我们有一个大项目......

523
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,028
Guy Fieri sucks!

523
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,028
Guy Fieri 太烂了！

524
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:48,005
<i>Hey!</i>

524
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:48,005
嘿！

525
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,888
<i>[Q] Ooh.
[Sal] Oh my god.</i>

525
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,888
[Q] 哦。[萨尔]哦，我的上帝。

526
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,403
Hey, you better
watch yourself, pal.

526
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,403
嘿，你最好注意自己，伙计。

527
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:53,349
[cheering]

527
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:53,349
[欢呼]

528
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:55,262
<i>[Sal] Oh my god.</i>

528
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:55,262
[萨尔]哦，我的上帝。

529
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,810
<i>We have a rule here
that says "no assholes"</i>

529
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,810
我们这里有一条规则说“没有混蛋”

530
00:20:57,835 --> 00:20:59,841
<i>and you are at the top
of the "asshole list".</i>

530
00:20:57,835 --> 00:20:59,841
而你就在 “混蛋名单” 的顶部。

531
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:01,677
Oh!!

531
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:01,677
哦！！

532
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,771
Wow. -I feel like the
biggest jerk in the world.

532
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,771
哇。- 我觉得自己是世界上最大的混蛋。

533
00:21:10,796 --> 00:21:12,716
Okay, so, Murr has no
social etiquette

533
00:21:10,796 --> 00:21:12,716
好吧，所以，穆尔没有社交礼仪

534
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:14,294
in this "rough and
Tumblr" punishment.

534
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:14,294
在这种 “粗暴的 Tumblr” 惩罚中。

535
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:16,005
And now you get a behind the
scenes look of how it happened

535
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:16,005
现在，您可以了解它是如何发生的幕后花絮

536
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,661
and bonus footage
from this episode.

536
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,661
以及本集的额外镜头。

537
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:18,997
I feel like the biggest
jerk in the world.

537
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:18,997
我觉得自己是世界上最大的混蛋。

538
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:20,763
I mean, you just told
Guy Fieri he sucks.

538
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:20,763
我的意思是，你刚刚告诉 Guy Fieri 他很烂。

539
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:22,333
I know!
-You're such a jerk.

539
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:22,333
我知道！- 你真是个混蛋。

540
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:23,161
[squealing] I know!

540
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:23,161
[尖叫]我知道！

541
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,294
<i>[Guy Fieri] Yo, yo,
what's up "funny man"?</i>

541
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,294
[盖伊·菲耶里]哟，哟，“有趣的家伙”怎么了？

542
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,489
How you doing, Guy? I'm
here with Sal and Brian as well.

542
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,489
你好吗，盖伊？我也和 Sal 和 Brian 一起在这里。

543
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:29,200
<i>[Q] Hey, bud.</i>

543
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:29,200
[Q] 嘿，伙计。

544
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:32,317
So, Guy, we're here. We're
punishing Murray here today at Tumblr.

544
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:32,317
所以，盖伊，我们来了。我们今天在 Tumblr 上惩罚 Murray。

545
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,278
You are, like, "a thing"
here, so...

545
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,278
你就像是这里的“一个东西”，所以......

546
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:36,146
when they told us
that, we're like...

546
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:36,146
当他们告诉我们时，我们就像......

547
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,419
we Facetime with Guy Fieri
and we make Murray

547
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,419
我们与 Guy Fieri 进行 Facetime 通话，我们让 Murray

548
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:41,325
mess up the Facetime. Like...

548
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:41,325
搞砸了 Facetime。喜欢。。。

549
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:43,302
give you a reason to
hang up on him.

549
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:43,302
给你一个挂断他电话的理由。

550
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:44,302
That'd be great.

550
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:44,302
那就太好了。

551
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:47,474
<i>[Joe] Yeah.</i>

551
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:47,474
[乔]是的。

552
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,435
Yeah! That's awesome!

552
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,435
是的！太棒了！

553
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,755
Alright, Christine, so you had
to pick out Murr's outfit.

553
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,755
好吧，Christine，所以你得挑选 Murr 的衣服。

554
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,700
-Correct. -Usually the guys
will tell you what to get

554
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,700
-正确。- 通常伙计们会告诉你该买什么

555
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:01,465
and this time they were just
like "get it" because

555
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:01,465
而这一次他们就像 “get it” 一样，因为

556
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,560
we have to call Guy Fieri.

556
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,560
我们得打电话给 Guy Fieri。

557
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:05,544
It's true. We were pressed for
time so I got to make some decisions.

557
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:05,544
是真的。我们时间紧迫，所以我必须做出一些决定。

558
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:07,497
<i>[Casey] He kind of looks
good, but for Murr</i>

00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:07,497
[凯西]他看起来不错，但对 Murr 来说

559
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:08,950
<i>like, it doesn't work.
-No.</i>

559
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:08,950
就像，它不起作用。-不。

560
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:10,700
It doesn't fit. It's like
a Bizarro Murr.

560
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:10,700
它不合适。它就像一个奇异的穆尔。

561
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:13,044
Yeah, it is. It's like a
<i>Twilight Zone</i> Murr.

561
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:13,044
是的，它是。它就像 Twilight Zone Murr。

562
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:16,536
Whoa, Joe looks cool.

562
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:16,536
哇，Joe 看起来很酷。

563
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,763
I know, those glasses
are fancy. -Whoa.

563
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,763
我知道，那些眼镜很花哨。-哇。

564
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:21,083
Very cool. What are you...?

564
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:21,083
非常酷。你是干什么的。。。？

565
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:22,575
Did you dress him?
Did you dress him?

565
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:22,575
你给他穿衣服了吗？你给他穿衣服了吗？

566
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,255
I did not dress him. That's
all his credit.

566
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,255
我没有给他穿衣服。这就是他的全部功劳。

567
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,185
Very cool.

567
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,185
非常酷。

568
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,169
<i>[Casey] You hate to... when other
people dress you?</i>

568
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,169
[凯西]你讨厌......当别人给你穿衣服时？

569
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:29,138
Yeah.
-Because you have a specific style.

569
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:29,138
是的。-因为你有特定的风格。

570
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:30,224
This is not my style.

570
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:30,224
这不是我的风格。

571
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,661
Which is... you're
style is

571
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,661
哪个是......你的风格是

572
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:33,122
lack of style, right?

572
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:33,122
缺乏风格，对吧？

573
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:36,825
Save this outfit. We're going
to use it 10 more times this season.

573
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:36,825
保存这套衣服。本赛季我们将再使用它 10 次。

574
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:40,685
Alright, it's the first ever

574

Cyle [kai-ull] 奖。

576
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:43,271
"Cyle with a C?"

576
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:43,271
“带 C 的 Cyle？”

577
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:45,075
Cyle with a C?

577
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:45,075
带 C 的 Cyle？

578
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:48,825
<i>Cyle, you can come up.</i>

580
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:54,043
“哦，现在我明白了。他看起来像 C 的 Cyle。

581
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:55,059
Oh, that's Cyle?

581
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:55,059
哦，那是 Cyle？

582
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:56,512
This is me. Hi, I'm Cyle.

是我。嗨，我是 Cyle。

583

You look like a Cyle
with a C.

583
00:22:56,537 --> 00:22:57,825
你看起来像一个带有 C 的 Cyle。

584
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:01,543
Accidentally kick the seat in front
of you when you cross your legs.

584
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:01,543
交叉双腿时不小心踢到前面的座位。

585
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:03,543
[quietly] Sorry.

585
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:03,543
[悄悄地]不好意思。

586

<i>[Q] Ooh.
[Sal] Oh my god, oh my god.</i>

586

[Q] 哦。[萨尔]哦，我的上帝，哦，我的上帝。

587
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:09,567
Look. Oh my god,
this guy's pissed.

587
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:09,567
看。哦，天哪，这家伙生气了。

588
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:11,348
<i>[Joe] This punishment
was made for him.</i>

588
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:11,348
[乔]这个惩罚是为他准备的。

589
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,371
It's not really so much a
punishment as it's just like

589
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,371
这与其说是一种惩罚，不如说是一种惩罚

590
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:15,004
he's allowed to
be his true self.

590
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:15,004
他被允许做真实的自己。

591
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,786
The guys are saying that
that's the real you.

591
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,786
伙计们说，那才是真正的你。

592
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:19,153
That's not the real
me, Casey.

592
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:19,153
那不是真正的我，Casey。

593
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:20,137
How true is it?
-It is not.

593
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:20,137
这是真的吗？-不是。

594
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:22,301
<i>[Casey] But there are certain moments
I felt like you felt at home.</i>

594
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:22,301
[凯西]但有些时候，我觉得你有宾至如归的感觉。

595
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:23,684
Well, I settled into it.

595
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:23,684
好吧，我适应了它。

596
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,918
So this is what Murray does
to us every single day

596
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,918
这就是 Murray 每天对我们所做的

597
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:29,864
and it's annoying
as hell.

597
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:29,864
这真是令人讨厌。

598
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:32,145
<i>[Q] Murray, ask if anybody
around you has a napkin.</i>

598
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:32,145
[Q] Murray，问问你周围有没有餐巾纸。

599
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:34,184
Got some napkins, bud?
You have a napkin?

599

有餐巾纸吗，伙计？你有餐巾纸吗？

600

You have a napkin?

你有餐巾纸吗？

601

"Nobody has a goddam napkin?"

601
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:36,887
“没人有该死的餐巾纸吗？”

602
00:23:37,106 --> 00:23:38,340
Nobody has a goddam napkin?

602
00:23:37,106 --> 00:23:38,340
没人有该死的餐巾纸吗？

603
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:42,450
How'd you get Guy Fieri?

603
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:42,450
你是怎么得到 Guy Fieri 的？

604

<i>[Q] It happened a
half-hour ago.</i>

<i>[Joe] I know Guy Fieri. I know
Guy. I had him in the pocket for a year.</i>

605
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,778
[乔]我认识 Guy Fieri。我认识盖伊。我把他放在口袋里一年。

606
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,723
<i>[Q] We found out they were big fans here.</i>
-You had Guy Fieri?

606
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,723
[Q] 我们发现他们是这里的忠实粉丝。-你有盖伊·菲耶里（Guy Fieri）？

607
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:51,528
[overlapping conversation]
And they had the towel already?
<i>-They do that here.</i>

607
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:51,528
[重叠对话]他们已经有毛巾了？- 他们在这里这样做。

608
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,036
<i>[Q] Wow, I mean they seriously
love Guy Fieri at Tumblr.</i>

608
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,036
[Q] 哇，我是说他们真的很喜欢 Tumblr 的 Guy Fieri。

609
00:23:58,277 --> 00:24:01,715
Every second. Every second gets
you closer to death. Ready?

609
00:23:58,277 --> 00:24:01,715
每一秒。每一秒都让你离死亡更近。准备？

610
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,262
Now we're closer to death.

610
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,262
现在我们离死亡更近了。

611

Keep this up, you'll get
way closer, way faster.

612

坚持下去，你会更接近、更快。

<i>[Murr] I'm going to cryogenically

[喃喃自语]我要把自己冷冻起来。

614
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:09,692
Is that weird? No.

614
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:09,692
这很奇怪吗？不。

615
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:11,325
You're telling me...
You're telling me!

615
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:11,325
你告诉我......你跟我说的！

616
00:24:11,457 --> 00:24:13,176
150 years ago, the life

616
00:24:11,457 --> 00:24:13,176
150 年前，生活

平均预期寿命

was like 40.

618
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:15,840
大概 40 岁。

619
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:18,489
150 years from now,
it's not going to be 110?

619
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:18,489
150 年后，不会是 110 年吗？

620
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:20,082
Or more? They're not
going to solve

620
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:20,082
还是更多？他们不会解决

621
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:22,418
the diseases that
ravaged humanity

621

200 years ago are now gone.

622
00:24:22,443 --> 00:24:24,575
200 年前的时代现在已经不复存在。

623
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,801
You just lived another
50 years because of me.

623
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,801
因为我，你又多活了 50 年。

624
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:30,567
It's just insane to think.

624
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:30,567
想想真是太疯狂了。

625
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,046
To <i>not</i> cryogenically
freeze yourself?

625

为了不低温冷冻自己？

626
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:33,164
Okay, go ahead.

好的，请继续。
