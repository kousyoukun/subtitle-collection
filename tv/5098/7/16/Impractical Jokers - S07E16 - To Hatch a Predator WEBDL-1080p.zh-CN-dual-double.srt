我们必须按照其他人告诉我们的去做和说出来。

18

If you refuse to do or say
anything, you lose.

18
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,625
如果你拒绝做任何事情或说任何事情，你就输了。

19

Okay. One second.
Let me set this up for us.

56

00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:37,857
Okay, so, just: [puff]
You blow into it as hard as you can.

你是意大利人！

65
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:02,527
Have you ever had an ancestry
test done before?

65
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:02,527
您以前做过血统测试吗？

66
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:03,918
No.
-Okay.

66

不。-好。

67
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:05,714
Great. And did you
bring your toenail clippings?

67
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:05,714
伟大。你带了脚趾甲剪吗？

68
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:07,503
Okay, and then you brought the...

68

好的，然后你带来了......

69
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:08,996
You brought the toenail
clippings then?

69
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:08,996
那你带来了脚趾甲剪下来的吗？

70
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:11,519
Oh, no. They didn't
tell me to do that.

70
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:11,519
哦不。他们没有让我这样做。

71
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,894
Sal, call Chase in and
chastise him.

71
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,894
Sal，把 Chase 叫进来，责备他。

72
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,589
Chase? Can you please come in?

72
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,589
追逐？你能进来吗？

[沉重的叹息]

74
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,410
No one told Ariana
about the toenail clippings?

74
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,410
没人告诉 Ariana 脚趾甲剪的事吗？

75
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:31,160
We have to have the
toenail clippings.

75
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:31,160
我们必须有脚趾甲剪。

76

<i>I mean, what am I coming in for
if I can't give people the full, accurate test?</i>

76
00:03:31,238 --> 00:03:34,168
我的意思是，如果我不能给人们完整、准确的测试，我来这里干什么呢？

77
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:35,714
"Can't coast on looks
your whole life, bud."

77
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:35,714
“你这辈子都不能靠外表滑行，伙计。”

78
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,738
You can't coast on looks
your whole life, Chase.

78
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,738
你一辈子都不能靠外表滑行，蔡斯。

79
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:39,089
"I'll see you at home tonight."

79
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:39,089
“今晚回家见。”

80
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,207
Just...

80
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,207
只。。。

81
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:43,480
I honestly, I can't deal
with it anymore.

81
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:43,480
老实说，我再也处理不下去了。

82
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,535
Alright, and I'll see
you at home tonight.

82
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,535
好了，今晚我们家见。

83
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,480
<i>[Joe] So, I guess the only
solution here</i>

83
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,480
[乔]所以，我想这里唯一的解决方案

84
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:54,019
is for you to pop your toe out

84
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:54,019
就是让你把脚趾弹出来

85
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:55,597
and I get a quick clip going.

85
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:55,597
然后我得到了一个快速的剪辑。

86
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:56,636
[Sal snorts]

86
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:56,636
[Sal 哼了一声]

87
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:00,660
Now, what I have here

87
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:00,660
现在，我在这里有什么

88
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,832
is a nail clipper, if you
want to, you know

88
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,832
是一把指甲刀，如果你愿意，你就知道

89
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:05,253
pop out, like a, pop out a toe,
or something like that.

89
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:05,253
弹出，比如 A，弹出一个脚趾，或类似的东西。

90
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,183
Take the one clipping,
that could be thirty

90
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,183
以一个剪报为例，可能是 30 个

91
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,691
percent more accurate, and
it could be even quicker.

91
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,691
% 的准确率更高，而且可能更快。

92
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,300
<i>[Murr] Oh my god.</i>

92
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,300
[喃喃自语]哦，我的上帝。

93
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:12,918
[no audible dialog from Sal]

93
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:12,918
[Sal 没有可听见的对话]

94
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,269
<i>[Q] Look at his face!</i>

94
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,269
[Q] 看看他的脸！

95
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:23,074
Put your hand out to receive
the toenail, buddy.

95
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:23,074
伸出你的手来接脚趾甲，伙计。

96
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,152
<i>[Q] Ohhhhh, god!</i>

96
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,152
[Q] 哦，上帝！

97
00:04:26,177 --> 00:04:27,871
Thank you very much.
And I appreciate that.

97
00:04:26,177 --> 00:04:27,871
谢谢。我很感激。

98
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:32,543
Sal. Overdo the hand sanitizer now.
On the desk--on your hands.

98
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:32,543
现在用过洗手液。在桌子上——在你的手上。

99
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:36,218
Do you have, to the best of
your knowledge... <i>-Here he goes.</i>

99
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:36,218
据您所知，您有吗......-他走了。

100
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,742
Do you have... do you know what
your ancestry might be?

100
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,742
您是否有...你知道你的祖先可能是什么吗？

101
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:43,468
Like, if I were to tell you, what
results might you be expecting?

101
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:43,468
比如，如果我告诉你，你可能会期待什么结果？

102
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:45,726
You stop when that's empty.

102
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:45,726
当它是空的时，你停下来。

103
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:48,445
One of the things we do here
is that we...

103
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:48,445
我们在这里做的一件事是，我们......

104
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,281
um, we like to
compare results...

104
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,281
嗯，我们喜欢比较结果......

105
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:52,874
<i>[Joe] Look at her eye checking it!</i>

105
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:52,874
[乔]看她的眼睛检查它！

106
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:55,156
<i>[Murr laughing] What is
going on?!</i>

106
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:55,156
[Murr 笑]这是怎么回事？！

107
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:56,601
Where were you born?

107
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:56,601
您在哪里出生？

108
00:04:56,648 --> 00:04:58,515
<i>[Murr] Keep pumping, bud.</i>
-Atlanta.

108
00:04:56,648 --> 00:04:58,515
[喃喃自语]继续抽水，伙计。-亚特兰大。

109
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,210
That's where you were born.
And raised?

109
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,210
那是你出生的地方。并加薪？

110
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:00,906
Yep.

110
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:00,906
是的。

111
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:03,570
Okay. Could you mind just
turning the page over for me?

111
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:03,570
好。你能介意帮我翻一页吗？

112
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,367
[dispenser pump clicking]

112
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,367
[分配器泵咔嗒声]

113
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,218
Terrific.

113
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,218
了不起。

114
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:09,749
Okay.

114
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:09,749
好。

115
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:12,960
This is empty now, so...
Okay.

115
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:12,960
现在是空的，所以......好。

116
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,695
Let's get the results in
there, Chase, now.

116
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,695
现在让我们把结果放进去吧，Chase。

117
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:15,749
<i>I've got the results.</i>

117
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:15,749
我得到了结果。

118
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,918
Thank you, buddy.
-Sure.

118
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,918
谢谢你，伙计。-确定。

119
00:05:17,686 --> 00:05:19,624
Alright, so, I-I have
your results here.

119
00:05:17,686 --> 00:05:19,624
好了，那么，我——我这里有你的结果。

120
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:20,811
Okay.

120
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:20,811
好。

121
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:23,780
<i>[Q] Oh, look at this.</i>
-Look at that.

121
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:23,780
[Q] 噢，你看这个。-看啊。

122
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,608
You allergic to silver?

122
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,608
你对银过敏吗？

123
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:28,257
You allergic to silver?
-No.

123
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:28,257
你对银过敏吗？-不。

124
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,897
<i>[Q] Any problems with a full moon?</i>

124
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,897
[Q] 满月有什么问题吗？

125
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:32,069
Any problems with a full moon?

125
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:32,069
满月有什么问题吗？

126
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:33,007
None?

126
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:33,007
没有？

127
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:34,569
It says you're part werewolf.

127
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:34,569
它说你是狼人的一部分。

128
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:40,061
It says here you're part...

128
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:40,061
它说你在这里......

129
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,999
Part what? I don't...

129
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,999
部分是什么？我没有。。。

130
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:42,835
Werewolf?

130
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:42,835
狼人？

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,194
I'm definitely not.

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,194
我绝对不是。

132
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,444
Okay.

132
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,444
好。

133
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:49,280
So this is "balls on" accurate.
It says you're not a werewolf.

133
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:49,280
所以这是 “balls on” 准确的。它说你不是狼人。

134
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,202
Let's get this whole thing
started. You just pick one of these.

134
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,202
让我们开始这整件事。您只需选择其中之一。

135
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,538
<i>Ah, you're just going to
swab around your mouth.</i>

135
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,538
啊，你只是要在嘴巴周围拭子。

136
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,811
Right around the, yeah, around the
side there. Perfect.

136
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,811
就在那儿，是的，就在那儿。完善。

137
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:03,827
<i>That's perfect.</i>

137
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:03,827
太完美了。

138
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:04,733
<i>So we're going to get right into it.</i>

138
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:04,733
所以我们要直接进入这个领域。

139
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:06,257
Great, I'll get this processed.
Thanks.

139
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:06,257
太好了，我会处理这个。谢谢。

140
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,436
Um, okay. So do you know
anything about Heritage?

140
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,436
嗯，好吧。那么，您对 Heritage 了解吗？

141
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:10,624
No. Never heard of it.

141
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:10,624
不。从来没有听说过。

142
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:13,701
Oh really. Well, we're new. It's
kind of like a rapid results ancestry...

142
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:13,701
真的。嗯，我们是新人。这有点像一个快速的结果祖先......

143
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:15,936
[All] Chase! [Sal] Come back in
with a suitcase full of results.

143
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:15,936
[全部]追逐！[萨尔]带着装满结果的手提箱回来。

144
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:19,249
<i>Oh, okay. So the results are in.</i>

144
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:19,249
哦，好吧。所以结果出来了。

145
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:20,741
Here you go.
[thump]

145
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:20,741
给你。[砰砰]

146
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:22,577
<i>Rapid technology we have.</i>

146
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:22,577
我们拥有快速技术。

147
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:27,100
Yeah, so it's very...
super in-depth. Yeah.

147
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:27,100
是的，所以它非常......超级深入。是的。

148
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,788
We put a full ream
of paper in there.

148
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,788
我们在里面放了一整整把纸。

149
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:32,303
<i>[Sal] 400 pieces of paper got
output in 10 seconds</i>

149
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:32,303
[Sal] 在 10 秒内输出 400 张纸

150
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:35,092
of his results from a Q-tip.

150
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:35,092
他从 Q-tip 获得的结果。

151
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:39,327
<i>[Sal] Now, Joe. You quiety read
every single piece of paper in there.</i>

151
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:39,327
[萨尔]现在，乔。你静静地阅读那里的每一张纸。

152
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:48,499
Look at all these results! He's thinking
he's going to go through those 1-by-1.

152
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:48,499
看看所有这些结果！他认为他会 1 对 1 地经历这些。

153
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:53,116
<i>[Sal] Look at his face!</i>

153
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:53,116
[萨尔]看看他的脸！

154
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,678
<i>[Murr] Look at how many
papers there are!</i>

154
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,678
[喃喃自语]看看有多少篇论文！

155
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,217
<i>[Sal] Don't say a word the whole time.</i>

155
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,217
[萨尔]全程不要说一句话。

156
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:00,374
<i>[Murr] Yeah. Circle things every
now and then. Arrows.</i>

156
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:00,374
[喃喃自语]是的。时不时地圈出东西。箭头。

157
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:03,171
[silence]

157
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:03,171
[沉默]

158
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,155
<i>[Sal] He hasn't spoken a word.</i>

158
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,155
[萨尔]他一句话也没说。

159
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:13,249
<i>[Sal] Also, also, Joe's doing nothing</i>

159
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:13,249
[萨尔]而且，Joe 什么也没做

160
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:15,217
<i>except circling words.</i>

160
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:15,217

[乔笑]

162
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:18,171
<i>[Murr] Stop laughing! Stop laughing!</i>

162
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:18,171
[喃喃自语]别笑了！别笑了！

163
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:20,022
<i>No sound! Don't break.</i>

163
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:20,022
没有声音！不要打破。

164
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:24,444
<i>[Sal] The guy's now just like, "you're
clearly, clearly not doing anything."</i>

164
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:24,444
[萨尔]那个人现在就像，“你显然、显然什么都没做。

165
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:32,623
God bless this man.

165
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:32,623
上帝保佑这个人。

166
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,568
This many probably has
a very happy wife.

166
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,568
这么多人可能有一个非常快乐的妻子。

167
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:38,724
I'm telling you. Patience like this?
<i>[Q] Yeah</i>

167
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:38,724
我告诉你。像这样的耐心？[Q] 是的

168
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,764
That's going to be a
successful relationship.

168
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,764
这将是一段成功的关系。

169
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,897
<i>[Q] Joe, cross reference a page
you already put, you already put there.</i>

169
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,897
[Q] Joe，交叉引用你已经放过的页面，你已经放在那里了。

170
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,584
[silence]

170
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,584
[沉默]

171

<i>[Murr] Home stretch!</i>

171
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,959
[喃喃自语]最后冲刺！

172
00:08:01,193 --> 00:08:02,326
<i>I can't wait!</i>

172
00:08:01,193 --> 00:08:02,326
我等不及了！

173
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:06,686
<i>[Sal] Isn't it funny how you
can turn pages funny?</i>

173
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:06,686
[萨尔]你怎么能把书页变得有趣，这不是很有趣吗？

174
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,576
You're Greek.

174
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,576
你是希腊人。

175
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:10,756
[chuckling] I am.

175
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:10,756
[轻笑]我是。

00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:13,717
Call Chase! Call Chase!

176
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:13,717
打电话给 Chase！打电话给 Chase！

177
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:15,131
Hey Chase, come on in.

177
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:15,131
嘿 Chase，进来吧。

178
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:17,193
[unintelligible] He's done! He's done!

178
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:17,193
[难以理解]他完成了！他完成了！

179
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:18,600
Thanks. He's Greek.

179
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:18,600
谢谢。他是希腊人。

Hi, I'm Brian. How are you?

181
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,482
大家好，我是 Brian。你好吗？

182
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,201
[unintelligible] how are you.
-Please have a seat.

182
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,201
[难以理解] 你好吗。- 请坐。

183
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:26,803
Uh. Alright [unintelligible]
thanks for coming in today.

183
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:26,803
呃。好的 [难以理解] 感谢您今天的到来。

184
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:29,006
I'm not really into it today.
I got a bad case of the shits.

184
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:29,006
我今天不是很感兴趣。我遇到了糟糕的情况。

185
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:30,389
Yeah.

185
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:30,389
是的。

186
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:41,092
Uh. Alright [unintelligible]
thanks for coming in today.

186

呃。好的 [难以理解] 感谢您今天的到来。

187
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,459
I'm not really into it today.
I got a bad case of the shits.

187
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,459
我今天不是很感兴趣。我遇到了糟糕的情况。

188
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:44,451
Yeah.

188
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:44,451
是的。

189
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:49,553
It's funny 'cuz it's true.

189
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:49,553
这很有趣，因为这是真的。

190
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,826
I gotta, I gotta go to
the bathroom.

190
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,826
我得，我得去洗手间。

191
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:54,787
Q's going to take a shit.

191
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:54,787
Q 要吃一坨屎。

192
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,764
Yeah. I have a bad case
today... of the shits.

192
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,764
是的。我今天有一个糟糕的案子......的狗屎。

193
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:04,506
Anyway.

193
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:04,506
无论如何。

194
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,256
Have you ever done anything
like this before?

194
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,256
你以前做过这样的事情吗？

195
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:09,732
No. It's called
Link-U-Later Technology

195
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:09,732
不。它被称为 Link-U-Later 技术

196
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:11,475
Ohh. Interesting.

196
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:11,475
哦。有趣。

197
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,459
Yeah. When, when InGen
went out of business,

197
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,459
是的。当 InGen 倒闭时，

198
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:14,623
because InGen
was a big...

198
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:14,623
因为 InGen 是一个大...

199
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:16,818
InGen! That's Jurassic Park.

199
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:16,818
InGen！那就是侏罗纪公园。

200
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:19,037
Remember they had
that park incident

200
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:19,037
记得他们有过那个公园事件吗

201
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,037
John Hammond, years ago,
had that big park incident?

201
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,037
约翰·哈蒙德 （John Hammond） 几年前发生了那场大公园事件？

202
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,506
When they went bankrupt

202
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,506
当他们破产时

203
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:25,100
we bought all of InGen.

203
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:25,100
我们买下了 InGen 的所有股份。

204
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:27,123
Welcome!

204
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:27,123
欢迎！

00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,397
<i>Okay. Alright. Just give a
swab. Toss it in.</i>

206
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,397
好。好。只需拭子。把它扔进去。

207
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,412
<i>There we go.</i>

207
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,412
好了。

208
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,264
<i>Oh, here's Chase. Okay, great.</i>

208
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,264
哦，这是 Chase。好的，太好了。

209
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,677
Thank you. Perfect
timing, buddy. Nice work.

209
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,677
谢谢。完美的时机，伙计。干得漂亮。

210
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:44,092
Do you know any other relatives
who have researched their family tree?

210
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:44,092
您认识其他研究过他们家谱的亲戚吗？

211
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:46,389
Uhh. My sister did, actually.

211
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:46,389
呃。实际上，我姐姐是这样做的。

212
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:48,217
It says that I was from
the middle "eastern".

212
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:48,217
它说我来自中东。

213
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,647
Middle eastern? Okay.

213
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,647
中东？好。

214
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:50,902
But I don't think I am.

214
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:50,902
但我不认为我有。

215
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:52,120
You don't think you are?

215
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:52,120
你不觉得你是吗？

216
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,769
Oh, perfect. Thank you, Chase.

216
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,769
哦，完美。谢谢你，蔡斯。

217
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:58,387
Yeah, these are just initial
results coming. So we'll just...

217
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:58,387
是的，这些只是初步结果。所以我们就......

218
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:00,285
Wow, you're 100% middle eastern.

218
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:00,285
哇，你是 100% 的中东人。

219
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:03,762
You are uh...

219
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:03,762
你是呃......

220
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:07,949
You are ex... almost exclusively,
100% middle eastern.

220
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:07,949
您是前...几乎全部是 100% 的中东人。

221
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:09,019
Seriously?

221
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:09,019
认真地？

222
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:11,254
You also had a Rice
Krispy treat earlier?

222
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:11,254
您之前也吃过 Rice Krispy 零食吗？

223
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:14,472
And did you eat... [laughs]
am I seeing correctly?

223
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:14,472
你吃了吗......[笑]我看错了吗？

224
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:17,277
You ate a Rice Krispy treat
earlier today?

224
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:17,277
你今天早些时候吃了 Rice Krispy 零食吗？

225
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:21,597
Does it say that?

225
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:21,597
它是这么说的吗？

226
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,566
That's right there. Those are the
Rice Crispy indicators.

226
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,566
就在那里。这些是 Rice Crispy 指标。

227
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:28,887
You did not have a Rice
Krispy treat today?

227
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:28,887
您今天没有吃 Rice Krispy 零食吗？

228
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,996
Not at all. I don't even
like those stuff.

228
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,996
一点也不。我什至不喜欢那些东西。

229
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,457
<i>[Joe] This is crazy.</i>
-This is crazy.

229

You and Ted Danson came

你和 Ted Danson 来自同一个叮咚。

You... you and Ted Danson.

231

你。。。你和泰德·丹森。

You guys came out of

<i>This genetic test showed that Q is a loser.</i>

239

这个基因测试表明 Q 是一个失败者。

00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:09,019
今天，我们在 Grocery Roll 与我们的纽约同胞一起拍摄微风。

241
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,423
While getting our shop on, we'll have
to do and say what the other guys tell us.

241
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,423
在开店的同时，我们必须按照其他人告诉我们的事情去做和说。

242
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:13,423
And if you refuse
anything, you lose.

242
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:13,423
如果你拒绝任何东西，你就输了。

243
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:15,877
And to make it more weird,
we'll be wearing bathrobes.

243
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:15,877
更奇怪的是，我们将穿着浴袍。

244
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:17,580
Like we just rolled out of
bed. Nothing weird about that.

244
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:17,580
就像我们刚从床上滚下来一样。这没什么奇怪的。

245
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,158
Nothing.
-No.

245
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,158
无。-不。

246
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:23,736
<i>[Joe] Okay. Here we go.</i>

246
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:23,736
[乔]好。来吧。

247
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:25,627
<i>Sal's got one sock on.</i>

247
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:25,627
Sal 穿了一只袜子。

248
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:31,033
"I love that scarf."

248
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:31,033
“我喜欢那条围巾。”

249
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,408
Ohh. I love your scarf.

249
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,408
哦。我喜欢你的围巾。

250
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:39,923
Yeah.

250
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:39,923
是的。

251
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:43,111
[laughing] Oh.

251
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:43,111
[笑]哦。

252
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:46,033
That was weird.

252
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:46,033
这太奇怪了。

253
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:49,142
Pick up one of those
bottles of olive oil.

253
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:49,142
拿起其中一瓶橄榄油。

254
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:50,939
Now this guy in the blue shirt

254
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:50,939
现在这个穿蓝色衬衫的家伙

255
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:52,642
just go to him: "will this
get me good and #### up?"

255
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:52,642
就去找他：“这会让我好起来吗 #### 起来？

256
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,986
Will this get me good
and #### up?

256
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,986
这会让我好起来吗 #### 起来？

257
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:02,564
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:02,564
是的。

258
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,970
"I've been out of the
house since last Thursday."

258
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,970
“我从上周四开始就出门了。”

259
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,845
I've been out of the...

259
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,845
我已经离开了......

260
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,892
I've been out of the house...

260
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,892
我出门了......

261
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,830
I've been out of the house
since last Thursday.

261
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,830
自从上周四以来，我就一直出门在外。

262
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:18,595
J-Just been getting
#### up on olive oil.

262
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:18,595
J-刚刚开始####橄榄油。

263
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,048
One sock.

263
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,048
一只袜子。

264
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:27,220
<i>[Q] Murray, whoa!</i>

264
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:27,220
[Q] Murray，哇！

265
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:29,845
<i>[Joe] There's Grand-Murr.</i>
-Psst.

265
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:29,845
[乔]有 Grand-Murr。-嘘。

266
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,048
This guy with the red hat

266
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,048
这个戴红帽子的家伙

267
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:33,111
stand in front of his cart so
he's gotta say "excuse me".

267
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:33,111
站在他的推车前，所以他必须说“对不起”。

268
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,830
But don't acknowledge
him until he talks to you.

268
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,830
但在他和你说话之前不要承认他。

269
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,064
Don't even look at him.
-Don't look at him!

269
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,064
甚至不要看他。- 不要看他！

270
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:46,267
<i>Don't acknowledge him.
Don't do anything.</i>

270
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:46,267
不要承认他。什么都不要做。

271
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,970
<i>[Joe] This guy just
took a picture!</i>

271
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,970
[乔]这家伙刚刚拍了张照片！

272
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:50,298
[Sal] That's going on
Instagram today

272
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:50,298
[萨尔]今天在 Instagram 上发布

273
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:51,892
unbeknownst that it's Murray.
-[Q] God, I hope.

273
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:51,892
不知道是穆雷。-[Q] 上帝，我希望。

274
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,658
<i>[Sal] Scratch your ass.
Scratch your ass!</i>

274
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,658
[萨尔]挠你的屁股。抓挠你的屁股！

275
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,970
<i>[Sal] Murr. Those tortillas
that you just picked up?</i>

275
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,970
[萨尔]穆尔。你刚捡到的那些玉米饼？

276
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:02,517
Tuck them up in
your pants

276
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:02,517
把它们塞进裤子里

277
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,705
<i>and then I want you to, like,
squat in front of someone</i>

277
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,705
然后我希望你，比如，蹲在某人面前

278
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,314
<i>and look like you're
pulling it out of you.</i>

278
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,314
看起来你把它从你身上了。

279
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:07,423
What?

279
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:07,423
什么？

280
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,752
It's got to look like it's
coming from your undercarriage.

280
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,752
它必须看起来像是来自您的起落架。

281
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,830
Yeah, I got it.

281
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,830
是的，我明白了。

282
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:13,658
Anything that you put in a hole
in Murray just falls right out.

282
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:13,658
你放在 Murray 的洞里的任何东西都会直接掉出来。

283
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,642
These things are... these things
are so uncomfortable, man.

283
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,642
这些东西是......这些东西太不舒服了，伙计。

284
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,127
Look at them, seriously.

284
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,127
认真地看着他们。

285
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,361
No, seriously, it's like I
don't know what it is

285
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,361
不，说真的，我好像不知道它是什么

286
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,361
[grunts loudly]

286
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,361
[大声咕哝]

287
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,736
[grunt] Oh, there it is.

287
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,736
[咕哝]哦，就是这样。

288
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:26,939
Wow. I don't know
what I just saw,

288
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:26,939
哇。不知道刚才看到了什么，

289
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,627
but I wish that I had
never seen it.

289
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,627
但我希望我从来没有见过它。

290
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,502
<i>[Joe] I'm not sure what happened.</i>
[Murr] That didn't work.

290
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,502
[乔]我不确定发生了什么。[喃喃自语]那没有用。

291
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,892
I-I'm still processing
my feelings about it.

291
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,892
我——我还在处理我对此的感受。

292
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:36,158
We're going to have to go to
commercial. We'll be right back.

292
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:36,158
我们将不得不转向商业领域。我们马上回来。

293
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:39,158
<i>[Q] You demoralized
the whole crew.</i>

293
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:39,158
[Q] 你让整个剧组的士气低落。

294
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:44,205
<i>[Joe] Are you reloaded with
tortilla?</i> -I can.

294
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:44,205
[乔]你重新装满了玉米饼吗？-我可以。

295
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:49,502
I never saw someone be so excited
to run to shove a tortilla in them.

295
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:49,502
我从来没有见过有人如此兴奋地跑去把玉米饼塞进去。

296
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:51,377
<i>[Joe] Okay, do it.</i>

296
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:51,377
[乔]好的，去做吧。

297
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,845
Murray, you're running
around trying to do it.

297
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,845
Murray，你到处跑来跑去。

298
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:56,220
<i>Do it! Do it! Now now now!</i>

298
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:56,220
做吧！做吧！现在，现在，现在！

299
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:58,923
<i>[Q] Nah, she missed. She missed the action.</i>
[Murr] ####.

299
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:58,923
[Q] 不，她错过了。她错过了这个动作。[喃喃] ####。

300
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:02,517
What are we doing? Is he ####
out tortillas? Is that's what's happening?

300
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:02,517
我们在做什么？他 #### 出玉米饼了吗？这就是正在发生的事情吗？

301
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:04,439
<i>[Q] No, they're not looking,
they're not looking, they're not...</i>

301
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:04,439
[Q] 不，他们没有看，他们没有看，他们没有......

302
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:05,720
[Murr grunts oddly]

302
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:05,720
[穆尔奇怪地咕哝]

303
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:07,220
They're not looking!

303
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:07,220
他们没有看！

304
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:09,580
Their backs are to you,
you idiot!

304
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:09,580
他们背对着你，你这个白痴！

305
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:11,892
<i>[Joe] Put the tortilla
back in your ass.</i>

305
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:11,892
[乔]把玉米饼放回你的屁股里。

306
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,923
<i>Wait until we tell you to go!</i>

306
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,923
等我们告诉你出发吧！

307
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:16,939
<i>Ready? Go!</i>

307
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:16,939
准备？去！

308
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:18,439
[Murr whines out a grunt]

308
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:18,439
[穆尔咕哝着]

309
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:19,939
<i>[Joe] Oh, he turned around.</i>

309
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:19,939
[乔]哦，他转过身来。

310
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:21,673
Put it back! Reload! Reload!

310
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:21,673
把它放回去！重新加载！重新加载！

311
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,767
I don't want to watch
this anymore.

311
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,767
我不想再看这个了。

312
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,345
Go! Go!

312
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,345
去！去！

313
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:28,345
He saw it! He saw it!

313
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:28,345
他看到了！他看到了！

314
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:29,736
What are we doing?

314
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:29,736
我们在做什么？

315
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,298
<i>[Joe] Alright. Here we go.
You ready, Woody?</i>

315
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,298
[乔]好。来吧。你准备好了吗，伍迪？

316
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,861
Tell this guy, "I saw a woman get
born today. It was fascinating."

316
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,861
告诉这个人，“我看到一个女人今天出生了。这太有趣了。

317
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:41,267
I, uh... I saw a woman

317
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:41,267
我，呃......我看到了一个女人

318
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,877
<i>get born today.</i>

318
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,877
今天出生。

319
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:44,767
It was fascinating!

319
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:44,767
这太迷人了！

320
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,611
No. No no no. Get
born today.

320
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,611
不。不 不 不。今天就出生吧。

321
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:52,736
I'm guessing 9 months ago

321
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:52,736
我猜是 9 个月前

322
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,142
her parents had sex.

322
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,142
她的父母发生了性关系。

323
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:58,408
So that was my day so far.

323
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:58,408
所以这就是我到目前为止的一天。

324
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:00,564
Yesterday, I pickled a toe.

324
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:00,564
昨天，我腌了一个脚趾。

325
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:04,017
Yeah. Y-Yesterday was even
crazier. I-I-I

325
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:04,017
是的。Y-Yesterday 甚至更疯狂。我-我-我

326
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:06,798
I pickled a, uh, human
toe yesterday.

326
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:06,798
我昨天腌了一个，呃，人类的脚趾。

327
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:09,642
Yeah, yeah.

327
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:09,642
是的。

328
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:12,564
"Maybe"

328
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:12,564
“也许”

329
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,048
M-Maybe, maybe.

329
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,048
M-也许吧，也许吧。

330
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:20,752
<i>[Murr] Q. Knock on his head.</i>

330
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:20,752
[Murr] Q. 敲他的头。

331
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:23,814
"Knock knock"

331
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:23,814
“咚咚”

332
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:26,689
Knock knock.

332
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:26,689
咚。

333
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:28,627
Keep doing it, keep doing it!

333
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:28,627
继续做，继续做！

334
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:30,548
Knock knock.

334
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:30,548
咚。

335
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:31,955
Who's there?

335
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:31,955
是谁？

336
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,033
You don't know knock knock jokes?

336
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,033
你不知道 knock knock 笑话吗？

337
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,205
Oh, hi, how are you doing?

337
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,205
哦，嗨，你好吗？

338
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,064
<i>[Joe] Knock on her head.</i>

338
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,064
[乔]敲她的头。

339
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,783
That's how you make him lose!

339
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,783
这就是你让他输的方式！

340
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:49,689
Look at this guy. Look. At.
This. Guy.

340
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:49,689
看看这个家伙。看。在。这。家伙。

341
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:52,283
Joe, confuse this place with a hotel.

341
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:52,283
乔，把这个地方和酒店搞混了。

342
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:54,564
<i>Find out when the hell that
maid's coming to clean your room.</i>

342
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:54,564
找出那个女佣什么时候来打扫你的房间。

343
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:57,486
<i>[Sal] Just keep going up and
down all the aisles, ranting.</i>

343
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:57,486
[萨尔]就不停地在所有的过道上来回走动，咆哮。

344
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,798
I can't find a bellhop if my
life depended on it!

344
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,798
如果我的生命依赖于它，我就找不到服务员！

345
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:03,736
Is anyone going to
bring my luggage?

345
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:03,736
有人会带我的行李吗？

346
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:06,673
I ordered a cheeseburger
for my room service. 45 minutes!

346
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:06,673
我为我的客房服务点了一个芝士汉堡。45 分钟！

347
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:09,314
The spa is supposed to be
on 4. Where do I see a spa?

347
00:16:06,986 --> 00:16:09,314
水疗中心应该在 4 号。我在哪里可以看到水疗中心？

348
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,970
You call <i>that</i> a pool?

348
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,970
你叫它游泳池？

349
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:15,127
Supposed to dip
my balls in it?

349
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:15,127
应该把我的蛋蛋浸进去吗？

350
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:20,080
Hands down, the worst hotel
experience I've ever had.

350
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:20,080
毫无疑问，这是我经历过的最糟糕的酒店体验。

351
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:22,220
I went down. I talked
to the concierge.

351
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:22,220
我下去了。我和礼宾部谈了谈。

352
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,439
He didn't give a ####.

352
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,439
他没有给出 ####。

353
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:25,689
I ordered room service an
hour and 10 minutes ago.

353
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:25,689
我在 1 小时 10 分钟前订购了客房服务。

354
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:27,236
They said the spa was on 4.

354
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:27,236
他们说水疗中心在 4 号。

355
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:28,861
They said the sheets
were Egyptian cotton.

355
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:28,861
他们说床单是埃及棉。

356
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:34,939
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm on a
TV show, yeah.

356
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:34,939
哦，对，对，我上电视节目了，是的。

357
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:38,830
Oh not right now. We start next
week. We start filming next week.
I can't wait.

357
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:38,830
哦，现在不行。我们下周开始。我们下周开始拍摄。我等不及了。

358
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:41,877
Did your room service come?

358
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:41,877
您的客房服务来了吗？

359
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:46,236
Yeah I am.
<i>-[Q] Ahhhh.</i>

359
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:46,236
是的，我是。-[Q] 啊。

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,955
Did you just...!?

360
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,955
你刚才是不是...！？

361

<i>[Murr] Kiss her again, Joe.

[喃喃自语]再吻她一次，Joe。[Q] 再吻她一次。

362
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:51,736
<i>[Sal] Just keep kissing her.</i>

362
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:51,736
[萨尔]就继续亲她。

363
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,439
<i>[Q] This family's
recognizing you.</i>

363
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,439
[Q] 这个家庭认可你。

364
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,127
Go kiss them all.

364
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,127
去亲吻他们所有人。

365
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:00,767
Joseph. What's your name?
-Aw. Debbie.

365
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:00,767
约瑟夫。你叫什么名字？-噢。黛比。

366
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,205
Debbie, good to see you.
Hi, buddy.

366
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,205
黛比，很高兴见到你。嗨，伙计。

367
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,345
Yes, of course.

367
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,345
是的，当然。

368
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,205
You're like Richard Dawson.

368
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,205
你就像理查德·道森（Richard Dawson）。

369
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:08,955
<i>[All] Kiss her, kiss her, kiss her!</i>

369

[全部]亲吻她，亲吻她，亲吻她！

370
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:10,861
What was your name?

00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:10,861
你叫什么名字？

371
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:16,080
If you want a selfie, take
a selfie, buddy. Go ahead.

371
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:16,080
如果你想自拍，就自拍吧，伙计。继续。

372
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:17,017
Take it, yeah, go ahead.

372
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:17,017
接受它，是的，继续。

373
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:18,455
They keep...

373

他们保持...

374
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:21,314
Why you keep kissing me?

374
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:21,314
为什么你一直吻我？

375
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:23,189
They telling you to keep
kissing me? Is that it?

375
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:23,189
他们让你继续亲我？就这样吗？

376
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:24,861
No, we don't start filming
until next week.

376
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:24,861
不，我们要到下周才开始拍摄。

377
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:31,205
<i>Q rolled out of bed just in
time to get punished.</i>

Q 及时从床上滚下来，正好受到惩罚。

378
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:33,595
Happy day!

378
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:33,595
快乐的一天！

379
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,814
Q is today's big loser.

379
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,814
Q 是今天的大输家。

380
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,158
And what a monumental day it is.

380
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,158
这是多么具有纪念意义的一天。

381
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:38,423
You're going to into this building
right now, buddy, and attempt

381
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:38,423
你现在就要进入这栋大楼，伙计，试试

382
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:41,080
to shatter a world record. Time
is of the essense.

382
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:41,080
打破世界纪录。时间是本质。

383
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:42,064
Here you go. Just go.

383
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:42,064
给你。快走。

384
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:44,455
Don't ask questions!

384
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:44,455
不要问问题！

385
00:17:45,392 --> 00:17:47,861
Who here likes turtles?
Raise your hand if you like turtles.

385
00:17:45,392 --> 00:17:47,861
谁喜欢海龟？如果你喜欢海龟，请举手。

386
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:48,783
Yeah!

386
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:48,783
是的！

387
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:50,048
<i>[Joe] So here's two of our producers.</i>

387

388
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:52,033
So, you guys all see
these eggs today?

388
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:52,033
所以，你们今天都看到这些鸡蛋了吗？

389
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:52,908
[kids] Yes!

389
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:52,908
[儿童]是的！

390
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,720
There's 144 turtle eggs

390
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,720
有 144 个海龟蛋

391
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:57,298
that are supposed
to hatch today.

391
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:57,298
它们应该今天孵化。

392
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,861
<i>[Sal] So they're being told that
Q is a scientist who's going to come out</i>

392
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,861
[萨尔]所以他们被告知 Q 是一位即将出柜的科学家

393
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:02,486
and help little baby turtles
out of all these eggs.

393
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:02,486
并帮助小从所有这些蛋中出来。

394
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:05,626
<i>[Murr] What we're telling Q, is that he's
here to smash these eggs over his head</i>

394
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:05,626
[喃喃自语]我们告诉 Q 的是，他是来砸这些鸡蛋的

395
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,830
<i>as fast as possible.</i>

395
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,830
尽快。

396
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:08,923
Yeah.
-You see the problem?
-Yeah.

396
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:08,923
是的。- 你看到问题了吗？-是的。

397
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:09,830
<i>[Joe] Hey, bud?</i>

397
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:09,830
[乔]嘿，伙计？

398
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,283
<i>[Sal] Do you have any semblance
of what you think you're about to do?</i>

398
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,283
[萨尔]你认为你将要做的事情有什么相似之处吗？

399
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,861
I have no... I have zero clue

399
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,861
我没有...我一无所知

400
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,095
as to what this is.

400
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,095
至于这是什么。

401
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,939
It's fun, buddy.
-I'm sure. For you.

401
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,939
这很有趣，伙计。-我确定。给你的。

402
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:20,283
Are you guys ready to meet the doctor?
[kids] Yeah!

402
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:20,283
你们准备好见医生了吗？[儿童]是的！

403
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,048
<i>[Sal] Q, you're going to go out there.
Say "You guys ready? Here we go!"</i>

403
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,048
[萨尔]问：你要去那里。说“你们准备好了吗？我们开始吧！

404
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:26,486
and attempt to break the most
eggs over your head

404
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:26,486
并尝试打破头顶上最多的鸡蛋

405
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:27,767
<i>in one minute.</i>

405
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:27,767
在一分钟内。

406
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:32,220
<i>[Murr] And Q, remember.
You're being timed.</i>

406
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:32,220
[喃喃自语]还有 Q，记住。你被计时了。

407
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,830
Speed is of the essence.

407
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,830
速度至关重要。

408
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,580
How's it going?
[kids] Hi!

408
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,580
进展如何？[儿童]你好！

409
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:38,236
Alright.
<i>-[Murr] Here we go.</i>

409
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:38,236
好。-[Murr] 我们开始吧。

410
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,298
You excited?

410
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,298
你很兴奋吗？

411
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:41,923
<i>[Joe] 3... 2... 1... go!</i>

411
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:41,923
[乔] 3...2... 1...去！

412
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:47,845
[kids shout and exclaim]

412
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:47,845
[孩子们大喊大叫]

413
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,033
Obviously, these are store-bought eggs.

413
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,033
显然，这些是商店买的鸡蛋。

414
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,033
<i>[Murr] Almost there, almost there!</i>

414
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,033
[喃喃自语]快到了，快到了！

415
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,126
This is going as planned.

415
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,126
这正在按计划进行。

416
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:12,517
<i>[All Jokers] 4... 3... 2... 1...</i>

416
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:12,517
[所有小丑] 4...3... 2...1...

417
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:16,158
<i>[Joe] Okay, that's it.
Yay!</i>

417
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:16,158
[乔]好了，就是这样。耶！

418
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:18,158
Alright, how'd I do?

418
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:18,158
好吧，我怎么样？

419
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:19,923
<i>[Sal] Okay, Q?
[Q] Yeah?</i>

419
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:19,923
[萨尔]好的，Q？[Q] 是吗？

420
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:22,689
Now, turn around and give
this presentation.

420
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:22,689
现在，转过身来做这个演讲。

421
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:26,923
<i>[Joe] Let's get started
with this presentation.</i>

421
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:26,923
[乔]让我们从这个演示文稿开始。

422
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:30,580
Alright. I'm so happy everyone
is here to watch these...

422
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:30,580
好。我很高兴每个人都在这里观看这些......

423
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,564
<i>[Joe] Okay, that's it.
Yay!</i>

423
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,564
[乔]好了，就是这样。耶！

424
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:39,751
Alright, how'd I do?

424
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:39,751
好吧，我怎么样？

425
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:43,888
<i>[Sal] Okay, Q? Now, turn around
and give this presentation.</i>

425
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:43,888
[萨尔]好的，Q？现在，转过身来做这个演讲。

426
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:48,559
Alright. I'm so happy everyone
is here to watch these...

426
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:48,559
好。我很高兴每个人都在这里观看这些......

427
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:55,106
<i>[Sal] Oh my god!</i>

427
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:55,106
[萨尔]哦，我的上帝！

428
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,700
<i>[Murr] Look at his face!</i>

428
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,700
[喃喃自语]看看他的脸！

429
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:58,747
Oh, boy, you have egg on your face.

429
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:58,747
哦，男孩，你脸上有鸡蛋。

430
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,231
[repeating] "Where are the turtles?"

430
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,231
[重复]“海龟在哪里？”

431
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,294
#### you guys. #### you guys.

431
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,294
#### 你们。#### 你们。

432
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,794
We just caused some
therapy bills, boys.

432
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,794
我们只是造成了一些治疗费用，伙计们。

433
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:12,622
<i>[Sal] No, we're going to tell
the kids eventually.</i>

433
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:12,622
[萨尔]不，我们最终会告诉孩子们。

434
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,559
[kids chanting] Turtles! Turtles!

434
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,559
[孩子们高呼]海龟！海龟！

435
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,559
Oh my god.

435
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,559
哦，我的上帝。

436
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:22,200
No amount of chanting will
bring these turtles back to life.

436
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:22,200
再多的吟唱都无法让这些海龟起死回生。

437
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:24,731
Turtles. Turtles hatched in captivity

437
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:24,731
海龟。圈养孵化的海龟

438
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,294
are 100% safe from
natural predators.

438
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,294
100% 免受天敌的侵害。

439
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:33,059
...and each turtles lays up
to a thousand eggs.

439
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:33,059
...每只海龟最多可产下一千个蛋。

440
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:37,013
So if we have 144 turtles here

440
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:37,013
因此，如果我们这里有 144 只海龟

441
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:41,778
we can have 144,000 turtles
in the future.

441
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:41,778
未来我们可以拥有 144,000 只海龟。

442
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:44,575
[kids screaming and heckling]

442
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:44,575
[孩子们尖叫和嘲笑]

443
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,950
It's mayhem.
-[Murr] Oh, no, Q.

443
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,950
这是混乱。-[Murr] 哦，不，Q。

444
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:50,872
This is my turtle, Myrtle.

444
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:50,872
这是我的，桃金娘。

445
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:52,138
That's Myrtle.

445
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:52,138
那是 Myrtle。

446
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,903
[laughing] Let's name
these baby turtles.

446
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,903
[笑]让我们给这些小海龟起名字。

447
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,122
This is dark, man!

447
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,122
这太黑暗了，伙计！

448
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,309
This is really dark.

448
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,309
这真的很黑暗。

449
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,809
Go for it, kids.
Just grab one.

449
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,809
去吧，孩子们。只需抓住一个。

450
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:10,278
No, here's one.
Here you go.

450
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:10,278
不，这里有一个。给你。

451
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,981
<i>[Joe] Be careful, don't break it.</i>

451
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,981
[乔]小心，不要打破它。

452
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:14,231
<i>"Actually, I don't trust you
with it. Let me hold it."</i>

452
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:14,231
“其实，我不信任你。让我拿着它。

453
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,388
Alright. Actually, let me
hold it. Because...

453
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:16,388
好。其实，让我拿着它。因为。。。

454
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:18,122
Q, drop that egg.

454
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:18,122
问，放下那个鸡蛋。

455
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:20,013
These are very delicate.

455
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:20,013
这些非常脆弱。

456
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,528
We said "drop it" not
"throw it to the ground".

456
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,528
我们说的是 “drop it” 而不是 “throw it to the ground”。

457
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:28,528
[kids chanting]

457
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:28,528
[孩子们高呼]

458
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,591
Well, we cracked that punishment.

458
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,591
好吧，我们破解了那个惩罚。

459
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:33,888
<i>[kid] Boo!</i>

459
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:33,888
[孩子]喝倒彩！

460
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:42,184
Here we go. Wow, hey!

460
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:42,184
来吧。哇，嘿！

461
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:45,138
So, the guys hatched the
perfect punishment

461
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:45,138
所以，这些家伙们策划了完美的惩罚

462
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:46,544
to crack Q.

462
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:46,544
破解 Q。

463
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:48,450
And, uh, now you get
bonus footage from

463
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:48,450
而且，呃，现在您可以从

464
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,216
this episode, and a behind
the scenes

464
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,216
这一集，以及幕后花絮

465
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:52,700
of how it, uh...
how it happened.

465
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:52,700
它是怎么回事，呃......它是如何发生的。

466
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,434
<i>[Casey] Why did you put
the sand on top?</i>

466
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,434
[凯西]你为什么把沙子放在上面？

467
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:57,684
I looked up how turtle eggs
actually hatch,

467
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:57,684
我查了一下海龟蛋实际上是如何孵化的，

468
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:59,684
and they hatch in the
sand. Like, on the beach.

468
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:59,684
他们在沙子里孵化。就像在海滩上一样。

469
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,856
So, this kind of makes sense as to
how they would actually be in real life.

469
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,856
所以，这种方式对于它们在现实生活中的实际情况是有道理的。

470
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:04,403
Oh, you put names on them?

470
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:04,403
哦，你给他们起名字了？

471
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:06,856
Yeah. Names on a couple.
-Oh, that is so... Aaron?

471
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:06,856
是的。一对夫妇的名字。-哦，原来如此......亚伦？

472
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:07,731
Norman...

472
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:07,731
诺曼。。。

473
00:22:07,756 --> 00:22:09,388
<i>[Joe] So, Q, you're going to
want to put those goggles on, buddy.</i>

473
00:22:07,756 --> 00:22:09,388
[乔]所以，Q，你会想戴上那些护目镜的，伙计。

474
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,731
Now?
<i>[Murr] Yeah.
[Joe] Yep.</i>

474
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,731
现在？[喃喃自语]是的。[乔]是的。

475
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:12,263
You're going to walk
out "in goggle".

475
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:12,263
你会 “戴着护目镜 ”走出去。

476
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:15,669
Okay. It's one of these ones where
we're just going to get under your skin

476
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:15,669
好。这是我们将深入您的其中之一

477
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:17,528
and it's going to be
annoying to you

477
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:17,528
这会让你很烦人

478
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:18,966
and you're going to
have to endure it.

478
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:18,966
你将不得不忍受它。

479
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:20,669
That's... every day.

479
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:20,669
那是。。。每天。

480
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,872
And that's it, no curveballs.

480
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,872
就是这样，没有曲线球。

481
00:22:24,872 --> 00:22:28,325
[kids chanting] Turtles! Turtles!

481
00:22:24,872 --> 00:22:28,325
[孩子们高呼]海龟！海龟！

482
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,138
<i>[Sal] Oh my god.</i>
[Murr] They want the turtles to live.

482
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,138
[萨尔]哦，我的上帝。[喃喃自语]他们想让海龟活下去。

483
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:33,247
Okay, guys, each...

483
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:33,247
好的，伙计们，每个人......

484
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,684
<i>[Joe] His microphone got
all messed up from the eggs.</i>

484
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,684
[乔]他的麦克风被鸡蛋弄得一团糟。

485
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:37,513
Just take your mic out
and hold it in your hands.

485
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:37,513
只需将麦克风拿出并握在手中即可。

486
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:39,122
Alright. Can everybody
hear me now?

486
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:39,122
好。现在大家都能听到我的声音吗？

487
00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:40,200
Okay.

487
00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:40,200
好。

488
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,075
<i>[Joe] It's off the rails anyway.</i>

488
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,075
[乔]反正它已经偏离了轨道。

489
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,278
No turtles were hurt in the
making of this punishment.

489
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,278
没有一只在制定这种惩罚时受伤。

490
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:45,747
Yeah, we don't know
that for sure, though.

490
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:45,747
是的，但我们不确定。

491
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:48,013
A turtle may have gotten hurt
in the wild. But that's not on us.

491
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:48,013
一只可能在野外受伤了。但那不是我们的责任。

492
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:50,856
Remember, kids, be gentle
with these turtle eggs.

492
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:50,856
记住，孩子们，要温柔地对待这些海龟蛋。

493
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:51,809
You know?

493
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:51,809
你知道的？

494
00:22:55,184 --> 00:22:57,669
Be gentle with me.
Please be gentle with me.

494
00:22:55,184 --> 00:22:57,669
对我温柔一点。请对我温柔一点。

495
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:01,059
Thank you.

495
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:01,059
谢谢。

496
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:04,122
See the reactions on
those kids' faces?

496
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:04,122
看到那些孩子脸上的反应了吗？

497
00:23:04,147 --> 00:23:06,028
The last time I saw
those reactions was

497
00:23:04,147 --> 00:23:06,028
我上一次看到这些反应是

498
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,138
James S. Murray

498
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,138
詹姆斯·默里

499
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:09,231
🎵For pet cremation and grandparent
divorce🎵

499
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:09,231
🎵宠物火化和祖父母离婚🎵

500
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:12,325
🎵Call James S. Murray of course.
La la la la!🎵

500
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:12,325
🎵当然是打电话给 James S. Murray。啦啦啦啦！ 🎵

501
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,778
<i>[wacky voice] Please call now!</i>

501
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,778
[古怪的声音]请立即致电！

502
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:15,794
I can make a jingle for this.
You know what I mean? Like...

502
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:15,794
我可以为此发出叮当声。你知道我的意思？喜欢。。。

503
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:18,341
You know, like...
🎵Turtle smasher!🎵

503
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:18,341

505
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:22,231
<i>[Joe] Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

505
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:22,231
[乔]去！去！去！去！

506
00:23:22,324 --> 00:23:23,746
<i>[Murr] Oh, no!</i>

506
00:23:22,324 --> 00:23:23,746
[喃喃自语]哦不！

507
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:26,466
[Sal] That was exciting.
[Joe] "Egg"-citing. It was "egg"-citing. Yeah.

507
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:26,466
[萨尔]这太令人兴奋了。[乔]“蛋”-引用。这是引用 “egg” 的。是的。

508
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:29,591
Eggs. Eggs.
<i>-[Joe] That's all you got?</i>

508
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:29,591
蛋。蛋。-[Joe] 就这些？

509
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,763
Got a lot of funny jokes in there.

509
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,763
里面有很多有趣的笑话。

510
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:33,106
Yeah. Yeah. Yolk-ed.

510
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:33,106
是的。是的。蛋黄版。

511
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:35,169
Impractical Yolkers.
Coming next fall.

511
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:35,169
不切实际的蛋黄。明年秋天推出。

512
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:36,825
I've been "Sal Monella" [salmonella]

512
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:36,825
我一直是 “Sal Monella” [沙门氏菌]

513
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:39,216
Those turtles won't
hatch anymore.

513
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:39,216
那些海龟不会再孵化了。

514
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,575
We hatched a great punishment.
That's what you can say.

514
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,575
我们酝酿了一个巨大的惩罚。这就是你可以说的。

515
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:44,466
<i>Is there a hose?
Is there a hose anywhere?</i>

515
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:44,466
有软管吗？哪里都有软管吗？

516
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,372
What's wrong, buddy?
You look shell shocked.

516
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,372
怎么了，伙计？你看起来很震惊。

517
00:23:46,397 --> 00:23:48,122
Like a fountain I could jump into?

517
00:23:46,397 --> 00:23:48,122
就像我可以跳进去的喷泉一样？

518
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:50,278
Ahh! Ahh!

518
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:50,278
啊！啊！

519
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,169
Do we have any that
are not freezing cold?

519
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,169
我们有没有不冻的？

520
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:53,747
We never have cold
water on set.

520
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:53,747
我们在片场从来没有冷水。

521
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,841
<i>[Q] Joe, sneeze really loud.
Right now.</i>

521
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,841
[Q] Joe，打喷嚏的声音真的很大。马上。

522
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:00,294
[sneeze]

522
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:00,294
[打喷嚏]

523
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,513
Great. Now go on about
how you just "snarted".

523
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,513
伟大。现在继续说你是如何“咆哮”的。

524
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:03,747
Oh. [stifles laugh]

524
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:03,747
哦。[抑制住笑声]

525
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:08,309
Snarted?
-Yeah, sneeze and a, sneeze and a

525
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:08,309
被诱捕？- 是的，打喷嚏和 A，打喷嚏和 A

526
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:09,841
Well, sneeze and a fart?

526
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:09,841
嗯，打喷嚏和放屁？

527
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,997
No, it shouldn't be that.

527
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,997
不，不应该是那样的。

528
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:12,184
It should be sneeze and snot.

528
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:12,184
应该是打喷嚏和流鼻涕。

529
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:13,653
It should be sneeze and ####.

529
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:13,653
应该是 sneeze 和 ####。

530
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:15,231
A #### and a sneeze

530
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:15,231
一个 #### 和一个喷嚏

531
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,247
would be a "sheeze".

531
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,247
将是 “sheeze”。

532
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:17,388
"Shneeze"

532
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:17,388
“喷嚏”

533
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:18,388
Sheez

533
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:18,388
希兹

534
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:19,325
Shneeze.

534
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:19,325
喷嚏。

535
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,341
No. The first two
letters of ####

535
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,341
不。的前两个字母####

536
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:22,430
S-H

536
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:22,430
S-H

537
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:24,789
and "art". Fart.
Is "shart".

537
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:24,789
和“艺术”。屁。是 “shart”。

538
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:26,539
Yeah, but #### and "sneeze".

538
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:26,539
是的，但是 #### 和 “sneeze”。

539
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:27,398
Shneeze.

539
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:27,398
喷嚏。

540
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:29,054
Oh, no, you're right. Get rid
of the fart, get ride of the F.

540
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:29,054
哦，不，你说得对。摆脱屁，摆脱 F。

541
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:29,867
Yep. Gotcha.

541
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:29,867
是的。明白了。

542
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:31,070
<i>[Murr] You ever shneezed before?</i>

542
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:31,070
[喃喃自语]你以前打过喷嚏吗？

543
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:31,695
[Q and Sal] No!

543
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:31,695
[Q 和 Sal]不！

544
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,648
It happens to me...

544
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,648
它发生在我身上......

545
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,289
You have an ongoing problem.

545
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,289
您有一个持续的问题。
