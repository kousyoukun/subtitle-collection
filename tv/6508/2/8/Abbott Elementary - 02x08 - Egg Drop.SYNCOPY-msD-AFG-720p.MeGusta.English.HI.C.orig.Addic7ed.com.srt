523
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:53,277
No, no, thank you. I am fine.

524
00:20:53,313 --> 00:20:54,946
You have a restful night
and a pleasant weekend.

525
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:57,515
[LAUGHS] Yep! You, too!

526
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,317
[WHISPERS] See? What is that guy's deal?

527
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:00,986
That guy really gets my goat.

528
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:02,520
I don't know what that means,

529
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:03,855
but that man is nothing
but nice to you, okay?

530
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,660
This is all in your head.

531
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:07,084
[AS MR. MORTON]
"Have a pleasant weekend."

532
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:08,542
Stop.

533
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,063
He doesn't sound like that.
I... Nobody sounds like that.

534
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,695
What's wrong with you?

535
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,153
Nothing. It's been a long week.

536
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:18,351
Geez.

537
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:19,875
Oh, Jacob Hill? Hate him.

538
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,867
Always have, always will.
