CHICAGO,ILLINOIS

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,270
Here,Gremlin.

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,910
Yeah. We'll fly up in October.

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,450
That would be great. Yeah.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,970
Hey,mom,you wanna talk to Charlie?

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,930
Charlie. Hello.
Charlie,say hi to grandma.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,680
No. Okay,I'm sorry,mom. She's zoned out.

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,950
I know. We've cut back.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,160
Mom,the kids are great.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,550
Hey,you're home early.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,280
Mom,call you back.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:45,980
You okay?

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,900
We need more water.
Fill the sinks and tubs.

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,250
We don't have much time.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,810
Ben,stop.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,450
It's happening,isn't it?

17
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,450
Bass,why don't you just call her?

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,710
Call her? Nobody calls anybody any more.

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,270
Come on,man. She's 22. She
doesn't even talk on the phone.

20
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,720
What,you wanna give me
some tech advice,huh?

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,490
You with your big fat
Casio '80s brick phone.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,610
Yeah.  It's my brother.

23
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,210
- Benjamin,what's up?
- Where have you been?

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,400
What's going on? What's the matter?

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,000
I've been calling. Where are you?

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,100
She's sending photos.

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,130
We,uh,went out,had a few.
We're on our way back to base.

28
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,570
What's going on? What's wrong?

29
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,720
Listen to me very,very carefully.

30
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,100
- Look at that.
- Shh,shh,shh.

31
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,410
- It's all gonna turn off.
- What?

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,440
It's gonna turn off,and it
will never,ever turn back on.

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,180
What's gonna turn off?
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,960
Everything. Everything's gonna turn off.

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,730
Ben? Did I lose you?

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,270
No,no,no.

37
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,850
Miles.

38
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,070
What the hell is going on?

39
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:57,470

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,440
15 YEARS AFTER THE BLACKOUT

43
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,390
What you gotta understand is
things used to be different.

44
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,610
We used electricity for everything,for
our computers,our phones,

45
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,720
even to grow food and pump water.

46
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,180
But after the blackout,nothing worked.

47
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,290
Not even car engines or jet turbines.

48
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,870
Hell,even batteries.
All of it gone forever.

49
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,060
People starved. Sickness without
medicine. Fires without fire trucks.

50
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,820
Governments fell. Militias rose up.

51
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,250
If you were smart,you left the city.

52
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,600
If you weren't,you died there.

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,230
So what the hell happened?
What caused the blackout?

54
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,750
So what does everybody think?

55
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,290
I know that learning isn't as
cool as bow hunting or whatever,

56
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,910
but still,this should bother you.

57
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:35,860
Physics went insane. The world went
insane overnight,and nobody knows why.

58
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,620
Hey,Ben!

59
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,220
Hey. Morning,Caleb.

60
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,440
Morning,Ben.

61
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,140
- Morning,Aaron.
- Hey,Ben.

62
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,820
You look terrible.

63
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,480
I was up all night.

64
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,530
Had a menage-a-raccoon
in my backyard.

65
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,040
Hmm?

66
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,890
Seen Charlie and Danny?

67
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,260
They left early. They said
they were going hunting.

68
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,660
Better be.

69
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,260
Take a look.

70
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,710
Charlie,how 'bout we
actually go hunting for once?

71
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,430
No one's stopping you.

72
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,610
Really?

73
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,210
The freezer,it doesn't work.
It's all gonna melt anyway.

74
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,570
Whoa,slow down,kiddo.

75
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,690
I want you to really,really
remember what it tastes like,okay?

76
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,620
Danny?

77
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,220
I'm fine,okay?

78
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,350
You're not fine. You're
having an asthma attack.

79
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,570
I can't breathe!

80
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,040
All right,now suck this
back. Doctor's orders.

81
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,890
Maggie,this is awful.

82
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,300
Yes,it's for the asthma.

83
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,870
You were supposed to watch out for him.

84
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,240
You know that road's not safe.

86
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,440
I know. I'm sorry,really.

87
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,440
It's
just--

88
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,090
Go on.

89
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,430
Nothing's safe.
Everything is off-limits.

90
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,890
I am just trying to look out for you.

91
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,460
I don't need you to. I
mean,dad,if it was up to you,

92
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,890
you wouldn't even let
us leave our street.

93
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,640
Fine,you know what,then wander
off into the the wild blue.

94
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,410
Get your throat slit by bandits or
get yourself lynched by a Militia.

95
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,510
Does any of that sound good to you?

96
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,940
It's not all like that.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,620
I don't know,it can get
pretty rough out there.

98
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,850
There's other towns like
ours,right? Other people?

99
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,020
Trust me. There is nothing
worth seeing,not any more.

100
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,800
Look,I was your age once. I get it.

101
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,320
But he's right.
Things are--

102
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,980
Excuse me,is she a
part of this family now?

103
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,290
Is that what's going on here?

104
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,250
She hops into bed with
you,and,what,that makes her mom?

105
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,270
No! Your mom is gone.
She died out there.

106
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,630
You wanna end up just like her?

107
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,540
I'm sorry.
Charlie,I didn't--

108
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,740
Here we have some mint. Look at this.

109
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,230
What we're gonna do is we're gonna
rub it between our fingers like this.

110
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,470
Okay,honey,I need you
to go with your mom now.

111
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,450
All right,y'all,come on. Come on.

112
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,920
- Take it.
Take it. - No--

113
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,860
Don't let anybody know that you have it.

114
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,130
If anything happens to
me,just do what I told you.

115
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,860
Stay off the road,they're
gonna be looking for it.

116
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,370
Keep it safe. Do you understand?

117
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,950
Ben,nothing is
gonna happen to--

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,520
Aaron,please.

119
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,790
My God. What a beautiful village.

120
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,950
This must be a mistake. We
already paid our spring taxes.

121
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,620
Oh,it's not about your crops.

122
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,500
We're not here with the local garrison.

123
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,600
Do you know a Ben Matheson?

124
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,650
You're looking at
him. What's this about?

125
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,930
Miles Matheson. He's your brother?

126
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,240
That's right.

127
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,520
Where is Miles?

128
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,900
I haven't seen him in
years. What's this about?

129
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm here under the orders of
General Sebastian Monroe himself.

130
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,550
He personally asked me to find two men.

131
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,260
You... and your brother.

132
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,190
Hold on just a second.

133
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,330
I'm gonna have to ask you to come with us
under the authority of the Monroe Republic.

134
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,560
Why?

135
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,450
Do I have to repeat myself?

136
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,800
I just don't understand.

137
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,920
Here's what you need to understand.

138
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:18,460
I have been searching for you for a
very long time through mud and filth,

139
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,660
away from my home and
my wife and my bed.

140
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,480
So I'm in a mood.

141
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,370
I'm sure you can understand that.

142
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,940
So do yourself a favor
and climb in that wagon,

143
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,450
or so help me,I will
conscript all of your children,

144
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,500
and I will reeducate them until
they no longer remember your names.

145
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,390
Are we clear?

146
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,680
May I have a moment?

147
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,770
Maggie,I'm gonna go with them.

148
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,730
No,you can't go.

149
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,130
I need you to look after my kids.

150
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,600
- No.
- It's gonna be okay.

151
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,400
- No,you won't come back.
- Maggie,it's okay.

152
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,470
Ben,no,it's not going to be okay.

153
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,790
You can't take him.

154
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,850
Danny,stop.

155
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,970
I suppose this is your boy?

156
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,400
My dad,he didn't do anything.

157
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,730
Danny,put it down.

158
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,740
We don't want any
trouble. Just go,please.

159
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,280
- Easy now.
- Danny,look at me.

160
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,490
Tell him to put his gun down.

161
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,890
Put his gun--tell him
to put his gun down!

162
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,980
Danny,I said put it down.

163
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,390
Kid's got a point,Ben!

164
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,610
How 'bout they put theirs down?

165
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,340
Sir,owning a firearm
is a hanging offense.

166
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,280
So go hang yourself.

167
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,860
- Caleb.
- Think about it.

168
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,280
I swear to God,I'll shoot him.

169
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,300
Put it down.

170
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,410
Can you just leave us alone?
Please,just go. Just forget about it.

171
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,370
- Danny,listen to me.
- Put it down!

172
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,270
- Tell him to stop.
- You need to do what they say.

173
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,970
- Put it down!
- Stop,stop.

174
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,440
Back up!

175
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,390
Ben!

176
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,770
Enough.

177
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,670
- Come here.
- Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

178
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,100
- Please,no! No! No!
- Dad!

179
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,010
Danny!

180
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,670
Dad!

181
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,600
Dad.

182
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,840
What happened?
What--what happened?

183
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,190
Danny's gone.

184
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,580
Danny's
gone? Who--

185
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,190
Militia. Militia took him.

186
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,960
Okay,okay,what do we do?
What do you want me to do?

187
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,960
Listen,my brother Miles is in Chicago.

188
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,370
At the Grand on Walton
Place,Miles is there.

189
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,280
He can get Danny. You
need to find Miles.

190
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,000
Dad,no. No,we'll catch the soldiers.

191
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,830
We can go right now.
We'll take him back.

192
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,780
No,no,they'll kill you.

193
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,420
But you're gonna come with me.

194
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,220
Okay? You're gonna come with me.

195
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,480
- I can't.
- Yes,you can. Please,please.

196
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,470
Listen to me,Charlie.

197
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,610
You're strong. You're so
strong. You're like your mom.

198
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:45,270
You can do this. You have to do this.

199
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,090
At least wait till
tomorrow. You need to sleep.

200
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,710
I'm wasting time.

201
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,800
This doesn't make any sense.
Why would they take Danny?

202
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,500
I don't know. I guess
we'll know when we find him.

203
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,320
Maggie,that's,uh...
that's really nice of you,

204
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,060
but they need you here.

205
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,150
James can take over as town doctor.

206
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,560
I'll be fine.

207
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,430
Maybe so,but I'm still coming with you.

208
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,400
You don't seem to understand.

209
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,020
I don't want you to come.

210
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,990
And I don't think you understand.
I'm not doing this for you.

211
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,260
You have got to be kidding me.

212
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,710
Uh,your dad was my
friend. I am going too.

213
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,920
Aaron,I mean,come
on,you're afraid of bees.

214
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,950
I'm not afraid of bees. I am allergic
to bees. There is a big difference.

215
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,310
Well,it's your funeral.

216
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,680
Probably,yes.

217
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,790
Son,I'm sorry you're
mixed up in all this.

218
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,490
But you gotta understand,

219
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,360
if I couldn't have your
dad,I had to take you.

220
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,250
Couldn't go back empty-handed.

221
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,340
But make no mistake. It's a mess.

222
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,750
Bad news for everyone.

223
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,710
Go.

224
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,040
To tell you the truth,when
general Monroe finds out,

225
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,810
he's gonna be irate.

226
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,240
Might even have my head.

227
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,410
Let's hope.

228
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,580
Let's not forget,you drew first.

229
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,280
That puts your daddy's
blood on your hands,son.

230
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,940
Hi,boy. How's my good boy?

231
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,490
Yeah,you want food? Good boy.

232
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,910
You know,a walk like
this,I counted on sore,

233
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,320
but not on the,you know,chafing issues.

234
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,550
So this brother,Miles,what
do we know about him?

235
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,220
How do we know that he can help us?

236
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,380
All my dad ever said about him
was that he's good at killing.

237
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,590
Oh. That's comforting.

238
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,170
You know,most people
just say good morning.

239
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,850
I
was,um--

240
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,960
Good morning.

241
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,870
'Morning. I'm Nate.

242
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,630
Charlie.

243
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,240
Where were you headed,Charlie?

244
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,080
None of your business,Nate.

245
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,700
That's true.

246
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,760
I'm gonna get some water.

247
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,710
Where have you been?

248
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,930
Just getting some water.

249
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,610
Aaron,maybe we should
camp somewhere else.

250
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,190
No,come on. They usually hide a
doctor's kit up front. Good meds.

251
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,850
How do you know?

252
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,810
I,uh,owned one,a plane.

253
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,980
Seriously?

254
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,650
Yeah. I used to work at
this place called Google.

255
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,470
That was a computer thing,right?

256
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,640
Now...it's nothing.

257
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,470
$80 million in the bank,

258
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,780
and I would trade it all right
now for a roll of Charmin.

259
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,290
Wakey,wakey.

260
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,360
- Ow!
- Don't.

261
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,360
You know,you folks
should be more careful.

262
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,330
I hear there's all sorts of
bad men out there on the road.

263
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,540
Look,man,just take
whatever you want and go.

264
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,990
Are you giving me orders?

265
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,110
Hey,take it easy,look. Side pocket.

266
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,920
Oh-ho-ho! You like to have
a good time? That's lucky.

267
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,370
'Cause we like to have a good time too.

268
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,590
No! No!

269
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,040
- No! No!
- Hey,leave her alone!

270
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,370
Wait your turn.

271
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,810
What's in the whiskey,bitch?

272
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,370
So,Nate,was it? Where are you headed?

273
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:05,300
Chicago. Hoping to get
on a fishing crew. You?

274
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,350
- We're headed to Chicago too.
- Charlie.

275
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,380
Look,we have food,and
I do kinda owe you.

276
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,640
Can you give us a minute?

277
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,130
Charlie,I'm telling
you,you can't trust anyone.

278
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,530
Is that why you carry poison whiskey?

279
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,590
They can't all be monsters. Some
people have to be all right. Don't they?

280
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,000
Up,up,up,up.

281
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,110
Let's just keep moving,all right.

282
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,400
What's wrong?

283
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,210
I know this place.
It used to be a hotel.

284
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,480
You stayed here?

285
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,840
I got married here.

286
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,660
- Hey,blondie.
- Hey,little girl.

287
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,250
Come on over,talk to
me. Come here,come here.

288
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,400
Where you going?

289
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,950
Excuse me.

290
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,730
Maybe you can help me.

291
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,030
Oh,God,I hope so.

292
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,290
- We're looking for somebody.
- And that accent.

293
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,410
Lady,you are classing up the joint.

294
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,390
That shouldn't be too
difficult,should it?

295
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,740
His name is Miles Matheson.

296
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,670
Never heard of him.

297
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,400
No,he has to be here.

298
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,750
What do you want me to say,kid?

299
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,360
If you know him or if you
know anyone that does,can you--

300
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,210
can you please let him know
that his brother's dead?

301
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,790
He was murdered by Militia.

302
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,520
Who are you?

303
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:01,070
Charlie. Charlotte,I'm--
I'm his niece.

304
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,300
Okay. Just you,come with me.

305
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,700
Whoa,hey,buddy.

306
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,360
You're not taking her anywhere.

307
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,970
She's my niece. I don't know you.

308
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,560
- Come on.
- Wait.

309
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,850
You're Uncle Miles?

310
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,250
Underwhelmed?

311
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,320
No,I just-- I mean,I
didn't expect--

312
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,350
Come on. Not in here.

313
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,940
No funny business now.

314
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,600
No,ma'am.
I'm not--

315
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,970
What happened?

316
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,170
Well,if you're gonna
have an asthma attack,

317
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,520
at least you had the good
sense to have it near me.

318
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,040
Here.

319
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,120
What is this?

320
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,640
You breathe it in.

321
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,930
It stops the attack before it starts.

322
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,210
You're a doctor?

323
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,590
It was my son's.

324
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,250
Now you wanna explain this?

325
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,240
I was running away from some soldiers.

326
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,640
- Monroe's boys?
- Yes.

327
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,730
Did they follow you here?

328
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,840
Look,look,I don't mean to
put you to any more trouble,

329
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,060
and I owe you
already,so--

330
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,120
so I'll
just--

331
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,610
I'll go.

332
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,170
That's it.

333
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,580
He said to come find you and
that you'd help us,and,uh...

334
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,640
and then he...

335
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,090
Yeah. I'm sorry.

336
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,420
I wish I could've...

337
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,690
Why did Monroe want my dad?

338
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,700
And why does he want you?

339
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,570
Monroe thinks your dad knew
something. Something important.

340
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,410
And he thinks your dad told
me,so I must know it too.

341
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,720
What?

342
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,540
Why the lights went out.

343
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,540
Maybe how to turn 'em back on.

344
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:44,150
If Monroe got the power going,that
would mean tanks and planes,factories.

345
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,320
He'd steamroll the entire continent,and
he'd butcher the other republics.

346
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,140
Okay. So what do we do now?

347
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,840
What do we do now about what?

348
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,460
How are we gonna get Danny back?

349
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,850
I didn't say I was going with you.

350
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,880
What?

351
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,340
In case you haven't noticed,

352
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,730
I'm trying to maintain a
certain low profile here.

353
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,250
No,look,look,I'm begging you.

354
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,760
Your brother is bait.

355
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:24,760
You understand that? I go after
it,not good for him... or for me.

356
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,020
I,for one,would like to keep
my insides on the inside.

357
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,030
No,no,look,I
have--

358
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,340
I have lost everyone that I care about.

359
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,750
My mom is dead. My dad is dead.

360
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,090
And God knows what they're
doing to Danny right now.

361
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,440
So you are gonna help me get him back.

362
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,700
Why's that?

363
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,380
Because we're family.

364
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,160
Family?

365
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,940
Kid,I don't even know you.

366
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,510
Yeah,you're right.

367
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,680
It was stupid of me to
ask. Sorry to bother you.

368
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,150
What's wrong?

369
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,800
- Let's get outta here.
- Charlie,what's wrong?

370
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,380
- Nothing,let's go.
- Tell me.

371
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,300
Hey,hey,hey,what happened?

372
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,770
Nothing,let's just go.

373
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,770
Let's just go.

374
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,870
Hey,hold on.

375
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,180
Step back.

376
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,530
So what'd you say to her,huh?

377
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,880
Militia,huh? When'd you enlist?

378
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,100
Uncle Miles,this is my
fault. I'm--I'm so sorry.

379
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,890
He's probably from the same
unit that took your brother.

380
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,050
Been following you from the
get-go,hoping you'd flush me out,

381
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,450
which is exactly what you did,isn't it?

382
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,850
So what are you gonna do?

383
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,190
This,as far as I know,

384
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,020
is the last bottle of
single malt in Chicago.

385
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,200
My plan is to sit here and drink it.

386
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,500
You can't just stay here. It's not safe.

387
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,970
Whose fault is that? Your boyfriend.

388
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,820
He's gonna go and get the nearest squad.

389
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,930
Two maybe three hours
tops is what you got.

390
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,210
So if I were you guys,I'd hit the road.

391
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,740
This is crazy. Just come with us.

392
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,530
Or don't,that's fine. But go somewhere.

393
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,180
You can't just sit here and die.

394
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,480
Just go.

395
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,890
Uncle Miles,come on.

396
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,160
I said go.

397
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,840
Get out! Get outta here!

398
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,920
Good morning. May I help you?

399
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,810
Sorry to bother you,but we're looking
for a dangerous,young fugitive.

400
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,550
19,six-feet,brown hair.

401
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,200
You're the first person
I've seen in weeks.

402
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,460
What did you do before the blackout?

403
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,980
Sorry?

404
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,740
Just curious.

405
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,870
Humor me,please.

406
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,720
I taught algebra.

407
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,080
Me,I was an insurance adjuster.

408
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,060
Most of my job was figuring out

409
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,600
whether the things people
said lined up with the truth.

410
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,150
Lucky for me,it's a skill
that never goes out of style.

411
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:21,850
So take,for example,those tracks
that lead right to your back door.

412
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,110
Tracks?

413
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,780
Fresh ones. About a day old. Two people.

414
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,850
A woman,who would have to
be you,dragging in a man,

415
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,220
and yet you say that I'm the
first person you've seen in weeks.

416
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,860
So tell me,does that sound
like the truth to you?

417
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,230
He's gotta be long gone.

418
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,210
If he's here,Monroe wants him alive.

419
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,860
Come on down. We don't wanna hurt you.

420
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:48,680
I don't wanna hurt them.
But I'm not going back.

421
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,980
You know,you could just let me
go. I'll drink myself to death.

422
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,630
You know we can't do that.

423
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,940
I know.

424
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,290
Take him. Now!

425
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,490
Shoot him!

426
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,440
Charlie?

427
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,420
You okay?

428
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,820
You know,I didn't ask you to come back.

429
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,150
Don't look at me. I
wanted to let you rot.

430
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,540
Why didn't you?

431
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,160
Because we're family,and that's
what my dad would have wanted.

432
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,800
Kid,if I'm coming with you,you're
gonna have to dial it back a notch.

433
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,190
You're coming?

434
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,850
Loverboy will just send more troops.

435
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,780
I can't stay here.

436
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,860
Thank you.

437
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,070
You're welcome.

438
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,600
We're all gonna end up with our
heads on a stick,but you're welcome.

439
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,160
Bass,what the hell is going on?

440
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,750
I don't know,but we
should get back to base.

441
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,760
This is not good.

442
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,420
Halt right there,gentlemen. I.D.'s?

443
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,240
Sergeant Miles Matheson.

444
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,000
You're good.

445
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,680
I-I don't--
Well,he knows me.

446
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,190
Sergeant Sebastian Monroe.

447
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,130
You're good.

448
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,450
Miles.

449
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,500
General Monroe.

450
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,470
Gerneral Monroe,Ben Matheson
is dead. We have his son.

451
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,750
With respect Capt. Nevilie

452
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,610
The Militia was here.

453
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:04,430
Did they find it?

454
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,600
No

455
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,920
So... What now?

456
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,910
