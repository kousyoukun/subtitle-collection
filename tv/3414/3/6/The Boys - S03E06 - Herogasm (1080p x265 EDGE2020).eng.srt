00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,000
She had help.

166
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,170
Soldier Boy's
just getting started.

167
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,800
[Starlight] Do you know
where any of them are?

168
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,130
[Mother's Milk] Those
shady-ass TNT Twins

169
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,090
got an address in Vermont.

170
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,090
- Okay. Does Butcher have it?
- No,

171
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,350
but he'll get it.

172
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,100
I think Soldier Boy
is bulletproof.

173
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,020
This ain't for Soldier Boy.

174
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,690
Look, I'm pissed
at those guys, too,

175
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,570
but we have to keep
our heads on.

176
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,030
Why? Why do I always
have to take the high road?

177
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,120
You know, when
white folks get mad,

178
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,620
y'all motherfuckers go berserk,

179
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,200
but I got to turn
the other cheek?

180
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,620
Fuck the high road,
fuck Butcher, and fuck Hughie.

181
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,290
Hughie is not himself right now.

182
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,590
Hughie is a grown-ass man
that's made his own choices.

183
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,540
M.M.!

184
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,590
Please. Soldier Boy

185
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,090
is gonna kill more people.
I mean, fuck.

186
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,550
Kimiko is in the hospital.

187
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,220
She lost her powers.

188
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,430
Frenchie isn't answering,
Alex is dead,

189
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,140
and Maeve...

190
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,610
We're all we've got.

191
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,650
It's up to us.

192
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,370
[cell phone ringing]

193
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,450
- Shit.
- [cell phone clicks]

194
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,580
This is Starlight.

195
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,960
Yeah, of course, Ashley.
I'll be right there.

196
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,840
I got to go up
to the Tower for a little bit.

197
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,210
Now?

198
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,130
If I don't go, they're
gonna know something's up.

199
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,880
I'll be one hour.

200
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,930
Do I need to worry about you?

201
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,190
Okay.

202
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,440
[door opens]

203
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,440
[narrator] Even the
greatest trees

204
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,730
must grow from a single seed.

205
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,820
Follow one proud
Black man's journey

206
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,110
to the root of his roots,

207
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,370
as he takes the
A-Train to Africa.

208
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,040
Jesus fucking Christ.

209
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,160
Hey.

210
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,040
It looks great.

211
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,420
Man, there's so much strength
in dignity.

212
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,880
What are you doing
about Blue Hawk?

213
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,090
Okay, first of all,
everyone at Vought

214
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,760
is just heartbroken over
your brother's tragic accident.

215
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,890
It wasn't an accident.

216
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,850
Blue Hawk went apeshit
for no reason.

217
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,970
Well, he said
he felt threatened.

218
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,260
- Threatened?
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,970
By what, a room
full of Black people

220
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,230
with no superpowers?

221
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,850
Look, I've scheduled him
for 12 weeks

222
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,100
of sensitivity training.

223
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,150
Fuck that.
I want charges brought.

224
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,400
Okay, A-Train,
persecuting Blue Hawk

225
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,070
will only make things worse.

226
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,240
This is a time for healing.

227
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,860
I don't give a shit.

228
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,070
I thought we got rid
of the Nazis around here.

229
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,240
[sighs] Vought rejects racism

230
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,160
- and Nazism
unequivocally. Okay?
- Hmm.

231
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,950
Now, uh, can we talk
about this later?

232
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,620
I have a lot going on today.
Thank you.

233
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,710
You know, whatever.
I don't need you.

234
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,210
I'll just ping his chip,
go get his ass myself.

235
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,550
No. Homelander wants
everyone to present

236
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,220
a united front right now.

237
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,470
My brother is paralyzed.

238
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,300
I want some fucking justice.

239
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,720
Seriously? Justice?

240
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,010
- Yeah.
- You want justice?

241
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
- Yeah.
- [grunts]

242
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,190
Oh, fuck.

243
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,650
I have spent over 100 hours

244
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,230
in crisis management meetings

245
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,860
specifically figuring out
how to cover up your bullshit--

246
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,200
including all three
of your straight-up murders--

247
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,200
while you were out
in the club with your crew,

248
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,320
or getting your toe sucked
by Popclaw,

249
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,040
who, let's not forget,
you also murdered.

250
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,830
Yeah, that's right.
I know about that.

251
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,080
You did not give a shit

252
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,920
about all the collateral
you caused then.

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,090
Now, all of a sudden, you care

254
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,420
because it happened to you?

255
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,760
Go fuck yourself.

256
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,590
Yeah, that's right.

257
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,600
I said that.

258
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,640
Out loud.

259
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,780
- [door closes]
- [Deep] Homelander.

260
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,700
- What?
- Couple things. Uh...

261
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,910
Noir, he's, uh, he's gone.

262
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,790
What do you mean, he's gone?

263
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,500
He cut out his tracking chip.

264
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,090
No, he-he-he...

265
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,680
He-he wouldn't. Not Noir.
He wouldn't run.

266
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,640
Well...

267
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,890
He wouldn't do that to me.

268
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,690
He w... he wouldn't run.

269
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,190
Tell him...
what we figured out.

270
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,610
Right.

271
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,440
We think Crimson Countess
was just the start.

272
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,070
We think... he's going after

273
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,700
his whole team, including Noir.

274
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,110
The good news is,
that means we know

275
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
where he's probably headed next.

276
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,290
The twins. TNT.

277
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,540
They're the closest. Vermont.

278
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,920
Okay.

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,630
Okay? Really?
Homelander, thank you so much.

280
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,510
Shh, shh, shh.

281
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,090
You go there,

282
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,600
and you check it out.

283
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,270
- Yeah.
- And if Soldier Boy
does show up,

284
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,310
then, uh...

285
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,940
- you call me.
- [Deep] Yeah.

286
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,610
Uh...

287
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,030
- what should I tell the twins?
- I don't give a fuck.

288
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,860
Got it.

289
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,860
Babe, that was amazing.

290
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,700
Yeah, but, you know, I didn't
need you to jump in there

291
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,200
like that.
I had the whole thing.

292
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,990
Hey, hey. [scoffs]

293
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,910
I'm just trying to help. Okay?

294
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,500
We're in this together, right?

295
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,170
Okay. Right.

296
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,290
Right. [chuckles]

297
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,000
[Deep sighs]

298
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,900
Why the long face, tiger?

299
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,190
What if I can't handle him?

300
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,860
I mean, if Noir ran...

301
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,450
Oh, you can handle him.

302
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,040
You're the top
of the food chain.

303
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,620
Hey, hey.

304
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,960
When we were kids,

305
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
alone in the bad room,

306
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,210
I got us through it, right?

307
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,510
Don't I always?

308
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,630
- Always.
- No matter what.

309
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,630
No matter what.

310
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,430
And now,
I'll get us through this.

311
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,810
Just as long as you and me
stick together.

312
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,730
But... what if Edgar's right?

313
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,230
What if it was a mistake
to take over Vought?

314
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,520
And-and...

315
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,190
and I am just talent,
and they all know I'm a fraud.

316
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,860
What do you care what
a bunch of mud people think?

317
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,160
[stammers]

318
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,740
Come on.

319
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,490
Tell me the real reason.
I want to hear you say it.

320
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,580
- Say it!
- I want them to love me.

321
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,920
Yahtzee!

322
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,790
Only it never seems
to work out, does it?

323
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,960
Madelyn, Maeve, Stormfront,

324
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,670
even your own son.

325
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,510
So why do you keep
running headfirst

326
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,060

488
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,490
- or something, you know...
- No, no.

489
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,450
...'cause he was scared
I was gonna pop his head.

490
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,320
[swallows]

491
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,530
Hmm?

492
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,240
Come on, Annie.

493
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,000
Put them away.

494
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm not gonna hurt you

495
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,960
or Hughie or your families.

496
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,210
Besides, you'd lose.

497
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,130
Then why are you here?

498
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,800
Because I want to help you.

499
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,090
Huh. Help.

500
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,640
From the psycho
who blew up Congress.

501
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,010
Look, most of those guys
passed around deepfakes of me

502
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,060
on the House floor
blowing bin Laden,

503
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,140
so I'm not exactly overwhelmed
with sympathy.

504
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,730
Annie, you need me.

505
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,270
You're all alone.

506
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,400
I mean, come on,
that "hashtag Homelight" shit?

507
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,360
That looks like you're in
a hostage video.

508
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,650
Blink twice if I'm wrong.

509
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,320
And, what, you got to play nice
with the guy

510
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,820
that throat-fucked you
on your first day of work.

511
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,910
And Maeve, they say Maeve
is in rehab,

512
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,080
but you and I both know
she's probably dead.

513
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,580
I'm all you got.

514
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,590
Come on, Annie,
you and I were friends.

515
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,460
None of that
has changed for me.

516
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,130
Are you ever gonna get
to the point?

517
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,720
You have 193 million
Instagram followers.

518
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,050
Lend me your influence,
and I'll lend you mine.

519
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,060
I can protect you
from Homelander.

520
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,930
You'll finally
be team captain for real.

521
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,810
And in return, you help me
goose my numbers.

522
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,940
I can finally get
my education reform bill passed.

523
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,860
We can make things
better, Annie.

524
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,070
For my daughter,

525
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,900
for a lot of daughters.

526
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,870
Come on, what do you say?

527
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,660
You're right.

528
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,090
This whole place.

529
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,130
I'm so fucking tired...

530
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,180
...of listening
to people tell me

531
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,270
I need to be shitty
in order to win.

532
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,230
Fuck you.

533
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,400
And fuck Homelander,
and fuck Vought

534
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,570
and this
"whatever it takes" crap.

535
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,820
You're just gonna end up

536
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,070
sitting on top
of the steaming pile of shit

537
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,410
that you built.

538
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,330
I'm done.

539
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,540
I'm fucking done.
I'm not doing it anymore.

540
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,120
You're not gonna be
doing anything

541
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,290
if Homelander kills you.

542
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,830
Yeah, maybe.

543
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,090
But then I'll know I'm not
working with a fucking nutjob.

544
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,880
So, either pop my head

545
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,130
or get the hell out.

546
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,030
Hey, keep this between us?

547
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,660
It'd be really tough to take out
America's sweetheart,

548
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,080
but not impossible.

[Frenchie] No.

[grunting]

554
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,000
[panting] No. S'il vous plait,

555
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,510
no. Don't do this.

556
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,970
His body is a masterpiece, no?

[inhales]

558
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,430
Do you know the story
behind this one? [exhales]

559
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,940
Oh, years ago, my cousin Kolya
went State's witness, so

560
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,360
I send my Serge. Not even three

561
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,030
bullets could stop
my attack dog.

562
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,280
Bar fight on the Basque coast.

563
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,120
He started it.

564
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,330
Oh, my beast.
This is my favorite.

565
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,250
When Serge was

566
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,040
14 years old,
he dropped a glass.

567
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,040
His father told him
to kneel in the shards

568
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,300
and not move until he said so.

569
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,880
Little Serge
did not shift an inch,

570
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,100
not even after his father left
to get drunk

571
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,060
and pass out in the whorehouse.

572
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,980
Oh, please, don't cry for Serge.

573
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,100
He likes to be told what to do.

574
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,440
And he loves to be punished

575
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,270
when he's bad.

576
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,900
Makes him hard.

577
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440

Don't do this! Nina!

582
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
[Little Nina] You must
choose, Serge.

583
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,870
If not, I will kill

584
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,710
both of them,
and when you've finished

585

I will kill you, too.

- [sighs]
- [Frenchie] It's over.

614
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,170
Have you always had that?

615
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,760
I don't know what
you're talking about.

616
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,760
[sighs] I grew up in Harlem,

617
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,180
brownstone filled with family.

618
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,230
Grandparents, uncles,
aunts, cousins.

619
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,480
One night,

620
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,400
there was a ruckus outside.

621
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,780
I looked out the window,
and it was Soldier Boy.

622
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,820
He had pulled up on some kids
that were trying

623
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,700
to boost a Benz, and so I run
and wake up my granddad.

624
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,120
"Grandpa, Grandpa.
It's Soldier Boy. Come look."

625
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,750
Soldier Boy takes the Benz,

626
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,670
and he hurls it
through our house,

627
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,590
like a fucking freight train.

628
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,380
It missed me
by about six inches.

629
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,170
And my grandpa...

630
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,090
One minute he was there...

631
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,510
...and then he wasn't.

632
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,100
And I woke him up.

633
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,060
I put him in that spot.

634
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,560
That is not your fault.

635
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,440
[Mother's Milk] That's when
this whole OCD shit started.

636
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,940
I mean, I don't understand it.

637
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,070
All I know is that
if I didn't check the burners

638
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,530
three times a night,

639
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,740
Soldier Boy would come back
and kill the rest of us.

640
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,660
And I'm still that kid.

641
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,080
Still getting up
in the middle of the night,

642
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,130
checking the burners.

643
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,920
'Cause if I don't,

644
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,470
Soldier Boy's gonna come back,

645
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,800
and he's gonna kill my family.

646
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,350
I got to get this motherfucker
out of my head,

647
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,270
and end this.

648
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,570
Or it'll end me.

649
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,960
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, hell nah.

- [Starlight] Oh, my God.
- Invitation?

651
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,540
I got your invitation
right here.

652
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,050
Hey.

653
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,220
Starlight. I did not
even recognize you.

654
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,930
Come in. You are
more than welcome to party.

655
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,260
- Party?
- [Love Sausage] Yeah.

656
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,720
The 70th anniversary
of Herogasm.

657
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,560
- Fuck me.
- Oh.

658
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,100
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

659
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,270
You seem familiar.

660
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,310
You about to get familiar
with these hands

661
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,480
if you don't get this
motherfucking love sausage

662
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,230
away from my goddamn face.

663
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,070
Okay, okay, okay.

664
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,700
You are not Supe.

665
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,360
I'm with her.

666
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,910
For the fuck party.

667
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,950
Yeah. Um, mm-hmm.
No, he's very good

668
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,620
at cunnilingus.
Yeah, his tongue

669
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,910
- is just... Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

670
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,210
He just gobbles
that vagina right up.

671
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,870
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom. [chuckles]

672
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,340
- Mm-hmm.
- Love Sausage, huh?

673
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,960
This is good name for me.

674
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,720
I like it. Come on in.

675
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,470
[moaning]

676
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,680
Oh, my God.

677
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,110
Oh...

678
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,280
All right, so once a year,
a bunch of C-listers

679
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,070
get together
at one of their places

680
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,950
- to get they wicks wet.
- [moaning]

681
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,820
- [grunts]
- Stop.

682
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,280
- Herogasm.
- Mm-hmm.

683
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,990
- I get it.
- Holy ass-ramming.

684
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,160
Ew.

685
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,250
Aw, stop!

686
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,620
Holy ass-ramming.
Holy ass-ramming.

687
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,130
- [screams]
- [moaning]

688
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,590
[female Supe] Come on.
Come on my hump.

689
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,050
That's it.

690
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,930
- [grunting]
- [electricity buzzing]

691
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,100
Poor Frenchie.

692
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,060
He's always wanted to see this.
He's gonna be heartbroken.

693
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,150
[Mother's Milk] You know
what's fucked up?

694
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,440
- Hmm?
- [Mother's Milk] It's that it's

695
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,860
real fucking sex workers here

696
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,490
getting banged up,
and not in the good way.

697
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,780
[screams]

698
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,400
[Mother's Milk] Not that
these Supes give a shit.

699
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,410
When Soldier Boy gets here,

700
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,870
it's gonna be a slaughter.

701
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,080
We have to get these people out.

702
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,000
What up, bro?

703
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,210
What the fuck
did this motherfucker

704
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,920
- put on my jacket?
- Oh, my God. Okay. Um...

705
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,340
It's my favorite fucking jacket.

706
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,840
- Let's go find a bathroom.
- Some nasty-ass shit.

707
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,460
- Let's go find a bathroom.
- This shit is sticky.

708
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,920
Let's go clean it up. Let's go.

709
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,840
- What the fuck is this shit?
- Yellowtail sashimi?

710
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,890
No. No, not in the mood
for that. Thanks.

711
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,430
- Goddamn it.
- [male Supe] Throwing ropes.

712
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,600
[gasps, screams]

713
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,890
[male Supe] Oh, shit.

714
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,810
Lick it up,
you yummy brown bear.

715
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,980
[door closes]

716
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,650
I can't.

717
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,360
I need a bathroom.

718
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,070
Right now.

719
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,370
[Hughie] Oh, okay.
So, this-this is an actual orgy.

720
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,740
That's what this is.

721
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,330
[Butcher] Fucking Herogasm.

722
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,330
Still a thing, eh?

723
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,330
It's my thing. I founded it

724
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,170
in '52.

725
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,960
Me and this other Supe, Liberty.

726
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,960
Man, was she a firecracker.

727
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,340
[Soldier Boy chuckles]

728
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,010
Frenchie's gonna be heartbroken
he missed this.

729
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,970
There are a lot
of people in there.

730
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,560
Well, as long as they stay out
of my way, they'll be fine.

731
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,900
Okay, all right. Just, uh,
give me three minutes.

732
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,020
I'll jump in,
I'll jump back out.

733
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,230
I'll tell you exactly where

734
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,400
to find the twins.
Nobody else in your way.

735
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,280
Three minutes.

736
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,990
[Blue Hawk] Soldier Boy?
Nah, he's dead as dog shit.

737
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,830
No, he's not.

738
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,540
I swear,
this is really happening.

739
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,710
Please, you need to help me
get people out of here, now.

740
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,380
Starlight, come on.

741
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
Do not let them do this to you.

742
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,220
- [sighs]
- This... this fear.

743
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,090
You heard what Homelander said.

744
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,760
Lamestream media's
making a fucking mountain

745
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,510
out of a molehill.

746
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,430
- Do the research.
- Oh, my God.

747
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,730
This is real.

748
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,020
These attacks are real.

749
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,310
Soldier Boy is real.

750
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,940
Well, I just think
you could stand to be

751
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,440
a little better informed.

752
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,990
Homelander's gonna
take care of it, okay?

753
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,820
I'm gonna go find
a salad to toss.

754
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,120
Excuse me.

755
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,120
[moaning in distance]

756
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,000
[panting]

757
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,370
[male Supe 2] You melted
my cock ring.

758
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,920
- [loud moaning]
- [woman] Oh, Jesus,
your stretching powers!

759
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,510
[Deep] Oh, my God,
your mouth is amazing.

760
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,350
It's like a velvet vacuum
draining my balls.

761
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,600
[Deep] Oh, yeah.
You are so fucking hot.

762
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,520
Oh...

763
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,650
God, your legs go on for days.

764
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,400
- [grunts]
- [squishing]

765
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,650
Ooh. Ooh. Oh, my God.

766
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,990
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

767
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,160
It's not what it looks like.

768
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,990
What are you doing here?

769
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,370
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.
Why would you even...

770
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,620
This octopus was sick.
Why would you ask that?

771
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,000
- Homelander is gonna love this.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please. Stop.

772
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,670
Stop, stop, stop. No.

773
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,170
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Look.

774
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,840
That's why I'm here.
It's his idea.

775
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,010
What's his idea?

776
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,100
I said no cameras
in the toilets, Tommy.

777
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,430
- Give it back.
- You're pathetic.

778
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,770
[Tessa] You know what?

779
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,230
Let's see how everyone feels
about close-ups

780
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,110
of their assholes
without consent!

781
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,400
Fuck you. I'm done.

782
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,150
[distant] I never want
to see you again.

783
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,240
Oh. That's so sweet.

784
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,120
Uh, just, I got to give
my asshole a breather.

785
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,750
You know?

786
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,250
[Tessa] Then say goodbye
to that Westfield mall opening

787
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,670
next week in Poughkeepsie,
'cause nobody

788
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,380
is coming to see you without me.

789
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,460
[Tommy] I fucking hate you.

790
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,090
I hate your mouth.
I hate the way your jaw pops

791
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,090
when you chew.

792
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,340
And I hated every second I spent

793
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,890
holding that clammy hand.

794
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,720
I should've killed you
in the womb.

795
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,810
Ah, fuck you!

796
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,970
Fuck you!

797
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,560
Fuck you, Tommy!

798
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,770
- [both grunt]
- Sorry.

799
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,270
Ah.

800
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,820
Hey, I know you like
fucking Supes,

801
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,980
but I'm off the table.

802
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,150
That's not why I'm here, okay?

803
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,490
You're here, too, you know.

804
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,780
Whatever, Pornhub.

805
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,490
I don't have time
for you right now.

806
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,130
Hey.

807
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,040
You never said you were sorry.

808
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,130
What?
