00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,270
[sighs] So put them
in a room together,

329
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,060
- are they gonna fight
or fucking hug?
- We don't know.

330
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,060
Soldier Boy's been, uh, weird.

331
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,820
- But Butcher...
- [Mother's Milk] If there's
a snowball's chance

332
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,030
that Butcher can take down
Homelander, he's gonna take it.

333
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,530
I don't care what
your orders are, I'm Starlight,

334
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,160
and I'm telling you that you
need to evacuate the Tower now.

335
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,120
Because Soldier Boy is
alive and he's real,

336
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,370
and he's gonna f... oh, fucking,
you fucking stupid...

337
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,960
Fuck.

338
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,130
There are a couple thousand
people in that building.

339
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,170
I mean, if he pulls a Herogasm,

340
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,090
he's gonna take
the whole fucking place down.

341
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,430
Then we take down Soldier Boy
before he gets to Homelander.

342
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,850
And save Butcher.

343
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,060
Y'all two fuck us over,

344
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,060
and now you want to be
Motherfucking Theresa?

345
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,810
I know.

346
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,320
- And-and I'm sorry...
- [Starlight] Hughie.

347
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,940
Some people are
just past saving.

348
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,030
He don't want to be saved.

349
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,030
[Hughie] He could've dragged me

350
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,030
down with him,
but he didn't.

351
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,990
There's still something good.

352
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,030
Deep, deep...

353
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,700
- ...deep inside.
- [Frenchie] Balls deep.

354
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,290
Perhaps.

355
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,460
Bonjour, Petit Hughie.

356
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,880
We save everyone.

357
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,250
Even if they don't deserve it.

358
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,010
Especially
if they don't deserve it.

359
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,640
Whoa... that brings me back.

360
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,270
Used to sneak
my dad's Manhattans

361
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,810
when I was a kid.

362
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,860
[Butcher] I didn't have
to nick nothin' from my old man.

363
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,440
He used to get me
and me little brother

364
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,940
lagered just for the hell of it.

365
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,070
Well, I got to admit,
that does sound funny.

366
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,120
[chuckles]

367
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,580
- The old man still around?
- [Butcher] Arse cancer.

368
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,910
[phone buzzing]

369
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,040
Shitting his guts out
as we speak, one hopes.

370
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,840
You ever see
The Soldier Boy Story?

371
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,010
- Must've missed it.
- It's a classic.

372
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,840
We lost Best Picture to
An American in Paris that year.

373
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,470
At least I got to ass-fuck
Jane Wyman in the coat check.

374
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,520
About a poor kid from
the streets of South Philly.

375
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,600
Discovers he's got

376
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,980
incredible powers
to match his...

377
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,060
heart of gold.

378
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,730
It's all bullshit.

379
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,570
Blimey, you don't say?

380
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,410
Actually my father owned half
the steel mills in the state.

381
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,570
I went to boarding school.

382
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,040
Got kicked out
of boarding school.

383
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,410
Because I was a fuck-up.

384
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,420
But he made sure I knew it.

385
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,790
Use the belt, did he?

386
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,340
[Soldier Boy] Never laid
a hand on me.

387
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,420
He couldn't be bothered.

388
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,260
Said I was a disappointment.

389
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Not good enough
to carry his name.

390
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,270
So I went to his golf buddies
in the War Department,

391
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,140
and they get me
into Dr. Vought's

392
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,060
Compound V trials.

393
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,770
I became a superhero.

394
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,280
Strongest man alive.
Fucking ticker tape parades

395
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,650
when I came home.

396
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,450
And what did
the old man say then?

397
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,530
Ah.

398
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,540
He said I took a shortcut.

399
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,710
That a real man
wouldn't have cheated.

400
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Mm.
[clears throat]

401
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,930
What about you, you got kids?

402
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,930
It's complicated.

403
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,480
I always assumed
I had a few out there.

404
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
Somewhere.

405
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,980
I always wanted 'em.

406
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,650
'Cause I thought I could do it
better than my father did.

407
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,990
Homelander ain't yours.

408
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,700
Not really.

409
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,620
- He's the only blood
I've got left.
- It don't matter.

410
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,870
You didn't name him,
didn't raise him.

411
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,870
Vought grew him

412
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,250
in a fucking test tube
to take your place.

413
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,750
He's the fucking reason they
left you to rot with the Ivans.

414
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,920
Look, mate.

415
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,970
We had a deal.

416
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,650
[clucks tongue]

417
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,780
I'm gonna get some air.

418
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,490
[metal clanging]

419
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,460
[Homelander] Sharpen it
for a thousand hours,

420
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,630
still won't cut
Soldier Boy's skin.

421
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,510
So... you were on his team.

422
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,350
You knew him.

423
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,850
What was he like?

424
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,940
[exhales]
Come on.

425
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,650
Nobody's all bad.

426
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,530
[marker clatters]

427
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,830
He's my father.

428
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,910
I didn't believe him at first.

429
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,120
I ripped apart
the company archives,

430
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,130
and... it's true.

431
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,380
[laughs]

432
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,460
It's true.

433
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,840
They lied to me my whole life.

434
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
Surprise.

435
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Thing I needed most as a kid
and they kept it from me.

436
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,150
Now, well, I...

437
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,070
I'm not sure I want to.

438
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,820
It's funny, you know, everyone
thinks of you as this, uh...

439
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,540
unreadable sphinx.

440
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,200
A mystery.
[laughs]

441
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,250
Not me. I see through

442
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,710
that mask.

443
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,130
I mean, literally,
I can see your face.

444
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,130
Your battle scars.

445
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,800
The crooked old smile of yours.

446
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,260
I know when you're happy,

447
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,010
sad, telling the truth.

448
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,310
Lying.

449
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,690
Did you know?

450
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,770
That I had a father out there?

451
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,150
Alive this whole time?

452
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,000
[quiet sob]

453
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,630
Fuck.

454
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,800
Why didn't you tell me?

455
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,180
[stammers]

[Black Noir gurgling]

461
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,920
You should've told me.

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,510
[gulps, gasps]

463
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,350
Oh...

[all crying]

465
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,190
D-D-Don't worry, Earving.

466
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,900
We are so proud of you.

467
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,780
[all crying]

468
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,740
Soon you'll be
in the sweet embrace

[knocking on door]

472
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,810
[Butcher] Fuck me.

473
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,180
I figured you was dead.

474
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,900
You didn't think I knew
where the blind spots

475
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,310
were, motherfucker?

476
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,480
Back up.

477
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,740
Where's Soldier Boy?

478
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,070
You on that Temp V shit,
Butcher, huh?

479
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,950
What happens
if I pull this trigger?

480
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,660
Go on, do it.

481
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,990
Hey, M.M., M.M, stop.

482
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,870
M.M.!

483
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,830
If Soldier Boy goes through
with this, thousands will die.

484
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,460
Help us stop him.

485
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,130
[Butcher] This ain't
a bloody kinder care

486
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,380
we're on about, son.

487
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,130
Its Vought fucking Tower.

488
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,550
Becca worked in the Tower.

489
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,550
You shut your fucking
cake hole, Frenchie.

490
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,800
