Let me guess, it's perfect, but you know just how to fix it.

95
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,510
如果法案通过 那相当于木桩直插沃特的心脏

108
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,340
- 以星光的身份吗  - 是的
- You'll do it as Starlight? - Yes.

109
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,760
如果有必要的话
I'll even make another fucking... 

110
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,640
我甚至会再做一套该死的战衣
Supersuit if I have to.

111

而我会在后座上睡着
and I'd fall asleep to it in the backseat.

138
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,860
枪声把我吵醒了
The gunshots woke me up.

139
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,280
我听到他从走廊走来 就躲在了床底下
I heard 'em coming down the hallway, so I just hid under my bed.

140
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,240
我只看到了他的脚踝
All I saw was his ankle.

141
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,750
他有伤疤 或者可能是烧伤
He had these scars, or these burns maybe.

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,380
总会在噩梦中重现这些场景
Ugh, a lot of nightmares about those.

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,090
对不起
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,850
吃早餐吗
Breakfast?

145
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,530
你好吗
Hey, how are you? 

146
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,070
嗨 珍妮特
Hey, Janet.

147
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,030
你们好 叫史黛西和马克来吧
Hey, guys, let's call in Stacey and Mark.

148
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,450
我们需要准备一份公告
We need to get an announcement ready.

149
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,920
怎么了
What?

150
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,630
他们在做什么
What are they doing?

151
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,760
沃特新闻

152
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,010
鞭炮带你看真相

153
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,100
儿童自由斗士

154
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,100
那个贱人
That bitch.

155
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,980
沃特新闻网正在为鞭炮 搞节目的启动仪式
VNN is handling the launch of Firecracker's show,

156
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,610
所有沃特的媒体网络都将进行联播
simulcast across all Vought networks.

157
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,030
网络喷子们已经在挖掘 各种关于星光的负面素材
The troll farms are already digging up fringe anti-Starlight content

158
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,070
并将其注入主流媒体
and injecting it into the mainstream.

159
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,450
目前 “星光的进步圣战”
So far, "Starlight's Progressive Jihad"

160
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,540
和标签“傲慢的白人女权主义” 势头强劲
and "#ArrogantWhiteFeminism" are showing promise.

161
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,370
我们需要算法 来找到最容易接受这些内容的用户
We need the algorithm to find the most receptive users,

162
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,880
将文章在其社媒的订阅页面上置顶
then blast the articles to the top of their social feeds

163
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,130
直到一亿人不明所以地
until 100 million people are outraged by Starlight

164
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,420
对星光感到愤怒难抑
for reasons they can't even explain.

165
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,920
厉害
Dope.

166
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,220
英雄们 你们有各自的谈话要点
Heroes, you have your talking points,

167
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,930
大家各司其职吧
so, everyone, get to it.

168
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,900
- 我们可以谈谈吗  - 不可以
- Hey, can we talk? - No.

169
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,650
我在想 午餐时
Hey. So, I was thinking over lunch 

170
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,650
我们可以点些风味小镇的油炸泡菜
we could order some of those fried pickles from Flavortown,

171
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,360
或者直接去比目鱼庞德尔 吃特别推荐菜肴
or just skip straight to the flounder pounder special.

172
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,120
我发现在某种程度上 你令人厌恶的程度无法量化
I find you repulsive in a way that's difficult to quantify.

173
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,250
而在量化方面 我他妈的十分在行 所以...
And I'm fucking amazing at quantifying, so...

174
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,130
大日子
So, big day. 

175
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,300
准备好了吗
You ready?

176
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,960
充分得超出你的想象
You have no idea.

177
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,050
- 我这辈子一直都在等待这一刻 - 最后一招
-I've been waiting for this my whole life. -One last piece of the puzzle.

178
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,810
我想你用这个 可能会有个精彩的收场
Figured this could be your big finish.

179
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,650
第一次见到你时 我觉得你有点傲慢
You know, when I first met you, I thought you were kind of uppity,

180
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,280
但其实你是个好人
but you're one of the good ones.

181
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,200
我们都是超级七人队的新成员嘛
Well, we are the new kids in The Seven.

182
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,410
得互相照顾
Gotta look out for each other.

183
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,000
美国

184
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,880
爱国者们 大家好
Hello, Patriots!

185
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,260
我知道 可能你们当中有很多人 都是通过我的播客认识我的
Now, I know a lot of you probably know me from my podcast,

186
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,470
但在接下来的六个小时里 沃特新闻网给了我平台
but VNN gave me the next six hours to bring you the truth 

187
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,890
让我告诉你们 星光和她的“恐怖”之家的真相
about Starlight and her house of horrors. Where dozens of trafficked children... 

188
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,150
包拿好了吗
Here, grab your bags and come with me.

189
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,060
亲爱的 你忘了这个 拿上
- Sweetheart, don't forget this. Here you go. - Okay.

190
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,440
我们从后门偷偷地把孩子们带出去
- We'll sneak the kids out through the back. - Okay.

191
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,860
你确定吗
Are you sure about this? 

192
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,490
确定 请告诉萨莎 别过多地使用客房服务 好吗
Yeah. Just please tell Sasha to have them go easy on the room service, okay?

193
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,990
那张卡快刷爆了
That card is almost maxed out.

194
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,280
- 没问题 - 谢谢
- You got it. - Thank you.

195
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,460
鞭炮的名人朋友们来了
Firecracker's celebrity friends are arriving.

196
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,000
我看到乔恩沃伊特了
I saw Jon Voight.

197
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
他妈的 他怎么来了
What the fuck is he doing here?

198
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,920
我要他回来
Bringing him back in.

199
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,390
不行 我不信任他
No. No, no, no, no, no. I don't trust him.

200
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,430
就是不信任他 如果让他回来 你就是疯了 好吗
I don't. And you're insane if you do, okay?

201
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,730
无论你经历了何种痛苦 都可以酒醉而死
And you can drink yourself to death in whatever dark hole you crawled out of.

202
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,900
- 好主意 我可能会照办 - 很好
-That's a good idea. I might just do that. -Good. 

203
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,400
等一下 等等 布彻尔
Okay, wait a minute. Hold on a second, Butcher.

204
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,110
天地明鉴 我对这个家伙有看法 我们俩都对他有看法
Look, Lord knows I got problems with the guy, too

205
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,450
但这事超越了你我的个人意见
We both do, but this is bigger than us.

206
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,620
祖国人和智者谈论的计划
That shit Homelander and Sage are talking about,

207
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,820
会引发世界末日的
that's some end-of-time shit.

208
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,080
他可能是个混蛋 但他是团队的一员 我们需要这个混蛋
Team is shy one total asshole. Now, we need this motherfucker.

209
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,460
- 母乳... - 安妮 这是我的决定 没得商量
- I mean, I'm... - Annie, this is my call. It's done.

210
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,180
那好吧
Well, all right then.

211
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,970
我很高兴我们解决了这个问题
Happy we got that sorted, eh?

212
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,430
谁能跟我解释一下
Now, can someone please explain to me

213
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,770
为什么鞭炮把你当成进攻目标
what makes you Firecracker's Moby Cunt?

214
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,270
- 我不知道 - 胡说八道
- I have no idea. - Bollocks.

215
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,570
真不知道
I don't.

216
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,650
那我们的下一步行动是什么
Now, what's our next move?

217
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,910
你跟上头给我要五万美金 三个小时内
You get me 50K from the Company, and in three hours

218
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,330
我就会准备好 对付这位“枪炮小姐”所需要的猛料
I'll have all the dirt we need on Little Miss Guns and Ammo.

219
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,620
布彻尔 我不可能让你 带着五万美金离开我的视线
Butcher, there's no way I'm letting you out of my sight with 50 grand. 

220
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,420
好吧 但我警告你
All right. But I'm warning you, 

221
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,580
我做的事 你不会喜欢的
you ain't gonna like it.

222
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,220
还有坎耶维斯特
And Kanye West!

223
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,140
但首先请看以西结的布道
But first, a sermon by Ezekiel,

224
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,980
在星光失去上帝的恩典之前 他是她童年的牧师
Starlight's childhood pastor before she fell from God's grace.

225
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,650
马上回来为您奉上细节 请不要走开
We'll be right back with that, y'all. You stick around.

226
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,730
美国
U.S.A.!

227
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,450
弗兰克 过来
Hey, Frank, come on over.

228
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,830
来一场废纸篮球赛怎么样
How about a game of wastepaper basketball?

229
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,580
什么
I'm sorry?

230
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,290
谁先投进三球谁赢 这么着吧 让游戏变得有趣点
Uh, first of three, and tell you what, make it interesting,

231
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,550
你赢了 我就让你早点下班 去见家人
you win, I'll let you knock off early, go see the fam.

232
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,840
好的
Um, okay.

233
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,550
很好 我先投
Excellent. I'll start.

234
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,150
这个游戏是我跟你学的 弗兰克
You know, I learned this game from you, Frank.

235
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,440
我不明白
I don't understand.

236
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,530
有一次 我看到你朝废纸篓扔东西
I once saw you take a shot at a waste basket, 

237
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,280
你投进了 然后...
and you nailed it, and... 

238
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,330
可你不记得
and you don't remember.

239
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,120
- 不记得 - 这个嘛
-No. -Yeah, well, 

240
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,330
我可记得很清楚呢
I sure do. 

241
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,460
你坐在那里 而我就在这个炉子里
Yeah, you were sitting there, and, well, I was in this oven here.

242
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,510
投中时 你还轻握拳头庆祝呢
And you made the shot. You did a little fist pump to celebrate,

243
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,010
然后 你调高了炉温 看自己是否会灼伤我的皮肤
and then you turned up the temperature to see if you could burn my skin.

244
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,390
这事你还记得吧
You remember that, right?

245
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,890
该你了
Your turn.

246
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,570
有趣的是 尽管我的皮肤没有烧焦
Fun fact. Um, even though my skin didn't char,

247
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,650
但仍然感到很痛
it still really hurt.

248
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,530
我是说 非常痛
I mean a lot.

249
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,660
我当时就在炉子里
Yeah, I was in there, 

250
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,790
痛苦地尖叫
screaming in agony,

251
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,580
眼泪立刻就嘶嘶地汽化了
and my tears just sizzled away.

252
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,710
是的
Yeah.

253
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,710
我记得
I remember there was, 

254
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,300
有好多人站在这里做记录
uh, people standing here taking notes, 

255
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,840
但越过他们 我看到你把东西投进了纸篓
but behind them I saw you make that shot.

256
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,810
那一投棒极了 弗兰克
It really was a great shot, Frank.

257
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,520
我只是在做自己的工作
I was just doing my job.

258
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,820
那一刻让我做了很多噩梦
You know, I had nightmares about that exact moment,

259
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,740
可你甚至都不记得这件事了
and you can't even remember it.

260
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,120
很可笑 不是吗 对于...
It's funny, isn't it, 

261
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,580
完全相同的事情 人们居然
how people can have such a different memory

262
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,040
能有截然不同的记忆
of the exact same thing.

263
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,580
我想都是因为视角不同吧
It's all a matter of perspective, I guess.

264
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,130
弗兰克
Hey, Frank?

265
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,470
这是我最后一投了 不如你去那边看着吧
This is my last shot. Why don't you go watch from in there?

266
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,260
- 约翰 不如我们... - 叫我祖国人
- John, why don't we-- -"Homelander."

267
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,480
- 进炉子 弗兰克 - 求你了
- Get in the oven, Frank. - Please.

268
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,650
进炉子 否则你的家人会和你一起进去
Get in the oven or your family goes in with you.

269
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,030
- 拜托 你不必这样做 - 马蒂
- Please, Homelander, you don't have to do this. - Marty.

270

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,800
现在
Now?

275
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,970
为什么
But why?

276
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,230
你只是在做自己的工作 对吧
You were just doing your job, right?

277
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,650
不 不要啊 救命 不
Don't do this! No.

278
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,920
我打赌你本会赢的
And I bet you would've won.

279
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,430
我的天哪
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 

280
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,970
我原谅你
I forgive you.

281
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,200
你的联系人在哪

282
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,710
不知道 他应该很快就到
Uh, I don't know, he should be here any minute.

283
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,500
顺便说一句 谢谢你为我保驾护航
Thanks, by the way, for being my muscle.

284
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,880
这里真臭 味道像腐烂的鱼鸭

285
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,470
鸡巴 鱼鸡巴

Yeah.

287
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,890
搞什么鬼
What the shit is this?

288
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,180
戴着金链子 长着山羊胡的话痨哪去了
Where's the talking goatee with the gold chains?

289
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,770
没关系 是我打给你的
It's okay. I'm the one that called you.

290
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,350
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

291
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,820
智者在盯着我 巴不得我露出马脚呢
Sage is on my ass, stares at me like I'm fucking dinner.

292
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,320
你居然认为现在是见面的好时机
But you thought this was a good time to be seen together?

293
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,030
我需要一剂五号化合物 今天就需要
I need a dose of Compound V, and I need it today.

294
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,120
就这事 为什么
Is that all? For what?

295
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
你在乎个什么劲儿
What do you care?

296
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,290
祖国人让人把所有的五号化合物 都锁在他的公寓里了
Homelander has every vial of V locked up in his apartment.

297
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,000
有好几百瓶 谁也拿不到
- Hundreds of them. Nobody gets it. Okay.

298
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,670
那么 一瓶不见了对他来说无所谓 你必须想出个办法
Well, he's not gonna miss one vial, then. You got to find a way.

299
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,670
不行 太危险了
No. It's too dangerous.

300

不 嘿 去他的 你欠我人情
No, hey. Fuck that! You owe me.

301
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,260
我欠你人情  我才刚他妈的救过你的命
I owe you? I just saved your fucking life.

302
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,220
发生在我身上 我们所有人身上的 每一件倒霉的事 可怕的事
Every single fucked up, horrible thing that's ever happened to me, to all of us,

303
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,600
都是由你一手造成的
it all started with you, 

304
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,680
因为你夺走了我爱的人
'cause you took away someone I loved.

305
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,480
- 你要把我爱的人还给我 - 什么
-And now you're gonna give someone I love back. -What?

306
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,020
我爸快要死了
My dad's about to die.

307
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,860
只有五号化合物才能救他
V is the only thing that can save him.

308
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,990
这是你...
This is your chance...

309
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,450
矫枉的机会
...to finally make things right.

310
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,620
为什么你会觉得我在乎这档子事
What makes you think I give a shit?

311
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,830
我不知道 你告诉我
You tell me.

312
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,130
如果我帮你
If I do this...

313
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,380
我们就两清了
we're good?

314
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,550
永远两清了
Forever?

315
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,720
是的
Yes.

316
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,560
怎么了
What?

317
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,650
你可没说我们要见火车头 另外 你居然想要五号

318
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,400
你还没吸取教训吗

319
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,610
喜美子 对不起 但那是我爸 我还能有什么办法
Kimiko, I'm sorry, but it's my dad. What else was I supposed to do?

320
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,240
对不起 但我认为你应该让你爸死

321
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,910
搞什么

322

不 天哪
No, no, no. Oh, Jesus.

327
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,490
那些家伙是谁
Who the fuck are those guys?

328
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,280
光 真理之光 光...闪光

329
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
他们为什么追我们
Why are they after us?

330
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,380
我杀了他们一伙人

331
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,290
该死
Fuck.

332
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920

Okay, what do we do?

333
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,260
跑 回到货车上

334
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,760
不行 我跑不了 我做不来
No, I-I can't run anywhere. I can't.

335
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,070
我不知道
No, no, no.

336
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,070
放松点 好吧
Easy. All right.

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,570
好吧
Okay.

338
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,280
我懂了
I got it.

339
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,750
想救你爸吗 要么战斗 要么死掉

340
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,960
爱让我们找到归宿
? Love lift us up where we belong ?

341
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,550
老鹰哭泣的地方
? Where the eagles cry ?

342
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,430
在山上...
? On a mountain...

343
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,650
危险 液氮 切勿接触 极度低温

344
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,490
五万美金的事
Not a word about that 50 grand 

345
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,910
还有用它干了什么 全都要对马洛里守口如瓶 混蛋
and what happened to it to Mallory, motherfucker.

346
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,290
都给网络写手了
Straight up Webweaver's stinky spider?

347

海洛因灌肠剂可不便宜 哥们儿
Heroin enemas don't come cheap, my son.

348

我永远无法忽视那些鸟事
I'll never unsee that nasty shit.

349
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,330
我他妈的不是警告过你了吗
Well, I fucking warned you, didn't I?

350
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,420
总之呢 无所谓的 我们需要的东西到手了 搞定
Anyway, don't matter. Got what we needed. Job done.

351

You ever gonna tell me what happened with that gash on your face?

352

354
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,650
你认为自己有资格要我帮忙吗
Think you're in a position to ask for a favor?

355
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,780
如果我临死还没搞定这事
If I can't get the job done before I, uh...

356
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,420
我需要你把莱恩从祖国人手上救出来
I need you to get Ryan away from Homelander.

357
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,790
布彻尔

358
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,670
我得...现实一点
I got to be realistic.

359
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,590
有些时候 我他妈的真感觉挨不下去了
Some days I can barely even fucking stand.

360
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,470
带他离开沃特 把他养大

361
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,390
把他养大
Raise him?

362
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,350
你是我所知的最好的父亲 M
You're the best dad I know, M.

363
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,350
最他妈好的人
The best fucking anyone.

364
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,060
这是你对我说过的最好听的话之一
That might be one of the nicest things you've ever said to me, but...

365
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,980
但如果莱恩不想离开呢
what if Ryan doesn't want to go?

366
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,490
那你就得逼他离开
Then you've got to make him.

367
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,370
白人垃圾走过去了
White trash walking.

368
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,960
表演得真是一流 亲爱的
Top-notch show, love.

369
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,130
只是不确定你是想让我们 跪在你的十字架前 还是把它烧掉
Just weren't sure whether you wanted us to kneel before your cross or burn it.

370
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,260
你们就是那些杀了我朋友的混蛋
Oh, you're those motherfuckers that killed my friend.

371
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,590
哎呀 真是不好意思了
Yeah, crying shame, that.

372
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,590
希望这么说能给你点安慰

373
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,680
此时此刻 他与上帝同在 正在品尝上帝的至圣之物
But if it's any consolation, he's up there with God, noshing on his holiest of holies as we speak.

374
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,390
我他妈的要给你颜色看...
I'm gonna shut your fucking face-- 

375
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,190
得了 稳着点吧 亲爱的
All right, all right. Keep your hair on, love.

376
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,150
我们只是想跟你聊聊而已
We just want a little chin wag's all.

377
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,520
- 说美国英语 - 对哦
- Talk American. - Right.

378
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,070
你还记得28岁那年神奇的夏天吗
You remember that magical summer when you was 28,

379
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,400
你在佛罗里达州
working as a counselor at the Capes 

380
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,200
戴维的基督圣经夏令营担任辅导员
for Christ Bible Camp in Davie, Florida,

381
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,410
遇到了那个让你心动的15岁男孩
and you met that lovely 15-year-old boy

382
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,660
后来不只是心动了而已吧
who tickled your fancy, and, well, then, tickled more than that, didn't he?

383
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,410
回忆起什么没
Ring any bells?

384
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,960
这是布劳沃德县 治安部门拍摄的一张小纪念品
Here's a little keepsake snapped by the Broward County Sheriff's Department

385
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,040
你可以把它存在自己的手淫照片库里
that you can stash in your wank bank.

386
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,420
你和你的小白脸儿
You and your little Bieber edging 

387
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,840
在餐厅的停车场车震 在你车的后座上翻云覆雨
in the back of your RAV4 in the car park of Buca di Beppo.

388
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,090
无论你的律师采取什么措施 来撤销对你的法定指控
Whatever voodoo Vought's lawyers pulled to get your statutory charges dropped,

389
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,010
你的福音派听众并不会在乎
I don't think they're gonna matter too much to your evangelical audience back there.

390
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,060
告诉我们你对智者和其宏伟计划
You're gonna tell us everything you know

391
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,310
所掌握的一切情况
about Sage and her grand plan,

392
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,110
不然我就点一下 “发送推文”的小按钮
or I hit this little tweet button here.

393
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,570
不如我自己发好了
How about I just send it myself?

394
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,790
闯了祸再说
Fuck around and find out.

395
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,630
星光的名字包含九个字母
"Starlight." That's nine letters,

396
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,460
或者是倒过来的六
or is that six... upside down?

397
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,720
安妮詹纽艾瑞包含十二个字母 也就是两个六
"Annie January," 12 letters, that's two more sixes.

398
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,640
三个六 魔鬼的标志 还需要什么证据
6-6-6. What more proof could you possibly need?

399
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,270
对不起 我得打断一下 非常抱歉
I'm sorry, I got to interrupt. I'm so sorry.

400
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,060
我需要忏悔
I need, I need to make a confession.

401
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,400
忏悔
A confession?

402
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,360
我需要忏悔我的罪孽
I need to confess my sins.

403
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,950
这件事无法粉饰 我...
Ain't no way to sugarcoat this. I had...

404
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,870
和一个可爱的年轻人
...inappropriate relations

405
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,950
发生了不正当关系
with a sweet young man.

406
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,960
该死 他的笑容太迷人了
Damn, that smile.

407
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
但那个年轻人
But that young man, 

408
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,050
他当时15岁
he was 15 years old.

409
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,170
但我的意志最薄弱的时刻
But the moment of my greatest weakness was also the moment

410
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:42,310
也是将我推向永恒救赎的一刻
that pushed me to my eternal salvation.

411
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,680
我重生了
I was born again,

412
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,180
我的罪孽被上帝
and my sins were washed away

413
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,350
爱的泪水涤荡一净
by the tears of His love.

414
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,110
赞美主
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!

415
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,740
现在 我相信我主耶稣基督
Now, I-I believe that our Lord Jesus Christ put 

416
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,780
让我在有生之年遇到那个年轻男孩
that young man in my life to lead me 

417
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,070
是要将我引向正义之路
to the path of righteousness.

418
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,530
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

419
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,910
你得选择沐浴上帝之爱的光芒
You got to choose to turn in to the light of His love.

420
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,710
而星光恰恰没有这样做
And that's what Starlight, she just didn't do.

421
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,960
你们都听说过 她第一次救人的故事吗
Y'all ever hear that story about her very first save?

422
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,670
她当时只有13岁
She was only 13 years old,

423
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,340
一名枪手进入沃尔玛 劫持了人质
and, well, a gunman came into Walmart and took hostages.

424
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,560
星光进了超市 英勇得很
Well, Starlight, she came in a'blasting.

425
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,640
但他们没有告诉你们
But what they don't tell you

426
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,230
那天她把一位人质弄瞎了
is that she blinded one of those hostages that day.

427
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,440
这位三个孩子的母亲 只是去商店给孩子买糖而已
A mother of three, just trying to buy Crunch Berries for her kids.

428
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,150
但是 星光
But Starlight, 

429
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,200
她不管不顾地对着镜头微笑
she just went on, smiling for those cameras 

430
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,080
就像这些事都没有发生过一样
like none of it ever happened.

431
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,040
星光并不是英雄
Starlight's no hero.

432
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,120
从来都不是
She never was.

433
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,300
我那时还在学习 如何控制自己的超能力 我...
I was still learning how to control my powers, I...

434
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,230
安妮小姐
Mademoiselle Annie.

435
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,690
无论你们尝试了什么
Well, whatever you attempted, 

436
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,280
看来是失败了
it seems you have failed.

437
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,110
话别说得太早了 法兰奇
Not so fast, Frenchie.

438
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,320
鞭炮拖车的钥匙
Keys to her trailer.

439
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,410
去搜搜看吧
Go give it a toss, will you?

440
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,810
火车头
A-Train.

441
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,850
你他妈的在做什么
What the fuck are you doing here?

442
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,150
拿五号化合物是吧
Taking V, huh?

443
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,820
- 你他妈的在做什么  - 什么也没做
-What the hell are you doing in here? -Nothing.

444
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,870
你在他的马桶里拉了一泡屎
You left a floater in his toilet?

445
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,290
我到这里时 马桶里就有屎
That was there when I got here.

446
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:56,370
这是我见过的最可悲的回击
That is the most pathetic clapback that I have ever seen.

447
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,000
知道吧 如果祖国人知道了 以后你就没命拉屎了
And you know, if Homelander knew, that'll be the last shit you ever take. 

448
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,630
是吗 如果祖国人知道 你拿了五号 他会活剥你的皮
Oh, yeah? If Homelander knew you took that V, he would flay you alive.

449
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,470
看来我们俩都有麻烦了
Looks like we both have a problem.

450
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,930
看来确实如此
Looks like we do.

451
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,690
那我们该怎么办呢
So, what do we do about it?

452
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,900
1米77 祖国人 16岁

453
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,370
- 马蒂 过来一下 - 什么事
- Marty. Come here for a sec. - Yeah?

454
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,170
我想道歉
I'd like to apologize.

455
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,210
为弗兰克的事道歉
For Frank.

456
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,180
我觉得自己刚才有点脾气暴躁
Look, I guess I-I got a little grumpy,

457
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,390
我很抱歉
and I-I'm sorry.

458
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,140
你能原谅我吗
Can you forgive me?

459
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,810
当然
Of course.

460
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,770
这些事情...这些事情总会发生
These things, these things happen.

461
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,570
谢谢
Thank you.

462
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,070
你一直是最善良的人之一
You were always one of the kinder ones.

463
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,860
- 是的 约翰 - 祖国人
- That's right, John. -"Homelander." 

464
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,110
祖国人 我们以前是朋友
Homelander. We were friends.

465
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,030
我一直都对你很好
I was always nice to you.

466
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,660
没错 确实是的
Yeah, that's right.

467
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,990
大部分时候
You were. Mostly.

468
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,540
你还记得你给我起的绰号 对吧
Well, you remember the nickname you had for me, right?

469
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,790
不会忘了吧
Really?

470
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,710
射精小子
"Squirt."

471
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,840
是的 你叫我射精小子 傻瓜
Yeah, you called me Squirt, silly.

472
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,840
你还记得为什么吗
You remember why?

473
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,140
- 不记得 - 马蒂 好吧
-No. -Oh, f-- Marty, okay.

474
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,480
但你确实记得我曾被关在那儿
But you do remember, though, that I used to be left in there

475
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,900
一关就是几个小时 甚至几天
for hours, days on end.

476
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,980
完全是独自一人 对吧
Completely alone. Right?

477
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,690
不过 我从来都不是 真正地独自一人 不是吗
Only... I was never really alone, was I?

478
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,780
一直有人盯着呢
Big Brother was always watching.

479
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,870
你一直都在盯着 不是吗 马蒂
You were always watching, weren't you, Marty?

480
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,750
不过
But... 

481
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:05,250
未成年的男孩有一定的需求 可以这样说吧
growing boys have... certain needs, shall we say?

482
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,760
所以 我发现你结束了晚上的巡视后
So I figured out that when you did your rounds at night,

483
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,800
我有大约几分钟的时间来...
I had about a couple of minutes to myself to, uh...

484
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,970
做...做男孩做的那档子事
well, to, uh, to do what boys do.

485
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,310
那会是一天中 唯一让我感觉良好的时刻
And-and that would be the only time of day that I would feel anything good.

486
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,730
有一天晚上 我没能及时搞完
So this one night, uh, I couldn't get finished in time.

487
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,990
你发现我没穿裤子
And you caught me with my pants down.

488
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,700
狠狠地嘲笑了我一顿
You had a really, really good laugh at me.

489
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,700
记得吗
Remember?

490
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,210
就在那时 你给我起了射精小子的绰号
That's when you nicknamed me Squirt.

491
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,710
我必须对你说实话 马蒂
I got to be honest with you, Marty...

492
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,500
你真的伤害了我的感情
...you really hurt my feelings.

493
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,640
我很抱歉
I am very sorry.

494
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,020
覆水难收
What's done is done.

495
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,650
过去的就让它过去吧
Water under the bridge.

496
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,480
但先在那里站着
But stay there a sec.

497
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,570
我希望你现在就在我们面前自慰
I do want you to jerk off in front of us right now.

498
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,370
各位 过来
Hey, uh, guys, come on over here.

499
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,580
快点嘛
Come on. Yeah.

500
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,750
我们都会嘲笑你的 好吗
We're all gonna laugh at you. Okay?

501
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,130
是的
Yeah.

502
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,260
这样 你就会知道那是什么感觉 我想我会感觉好些
That way, you will know how it feels, and I think I'm gonna feel better.

503
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,900
祖国人
Homelander...

504
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,820
我真的非常抱歉
...I am really very sorry.

505
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,160
我知道
I know, I know.

506
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,530
谢谢
Thank you.

507
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,080
不过 别害羞 把裤子脱下来
Now, don't be shy. Take your pants down.

508
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,660
马上
Now.

509
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,670
这就对了嘛
That's the spirit.

510
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,190
马蒂 好像你在剥小蘑菇
Marty, it looks like you're shucking a little mushroom.

511
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,990
可怜的小东西
Oh, that poor little thing.

512
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,320
为他加油 快啊
Cheer for him. Come on.

513
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,120
射
Squirt. Squirt. Squirt.

514
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,370
开局不顺 是吧
Not off to a great start, huh?

515
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,960
这么着吧 我给你点动力
Tell you what, I'll give you a little motivation.

516
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,840
现在就硬起来 不然我就用激光把你的老二割掉
You get hard right now, or I'm gonna laser your dick off.

517
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,590
好吗
Okay?

518
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,760
这下有动力了吧
Something to play for now. Mm?

519
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,100
要么射 要么丢掉老二 马蒂
Use it or lose it, Marty.

520
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,270
生杀大权掌握在你自己手中
Your life is literally in your hands.

521
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,560
来吧 射精小子
Come on, Squirt.

522
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,950
好 多吐口水 马蒂
Yes! More spit, Marty, 

523
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,780
多吐口水 会有用的
more spit. That'll work.

524
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,330
来吧 用力 漂亮
Come on! Put your fucking back into it. Attaboy.

525
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,040
我做不来
I can't.

526
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,000
来吧 马蒂
Come on, Marty!

527
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,370
听着 我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,880
好吧 没关系
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

529
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,670
老实说 很多男人都会遇到这种情况
It's okay. Honestly, it-it happens to a-a lot of guys.

530
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,460
确实 当然我没有遇到过
Truly. Not me, of course.

531
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,560
射得不错啊 伙计
That's a fucking squirt, Marty.

532
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,020
你让我的靴子上 沾满了鸡巴的血 马蒂
Whoa, whoa! You're getting dick blood on my boots, Marty.

533
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,280
住手 约翰
Stop it, John.

534
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,070
芭芭拉
Barbara.

535
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,450
恐怕蛋糕已经化了
Um, the cake's melted, I'm afraid.

536
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,410
请让他摆脱痛苦吧
Please put him out of his misery.

537
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,170
我原谅你 马蒂
I forgive you, Marty.

538
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,230
我们可以私下聊聊吗
Can we talk in private?

539
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,020
好主意
That's a great idea.

540
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,110
我知道应该去哪谈
I know just the place.

541
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,700
在...我办公室里谈更舒服
Um, it's more comfortable in my office.

542
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,200
不 我认为这里更好
No, I think in here is better.

543
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,010
喜美子
Kimiko!

544
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,560
天哪
Holy shit!

545
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,430
该死

546
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,830
妈的
Oh, shit.

547
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,490
你是否记得
Do you remember?

548
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,740
你给我冰淇淋之后
After you offered me ice cream,

549
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,160
把我扔进了后备箱
then threw me into that trunk?

550
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,960
你带我去了营地
You took me to the camp,

551
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,710
把我拖进了战斗坑
dragged me into the fighting pit.

552
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,500
我要么战斗
I could either fight

553
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,420
要么就得死
or die.

554
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,430
你害我留下了这些疤痕
Then you left me with these.

555
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,350
我恨你
I hate you.

556
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,710
喜美子
Kimiko...

557
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,850
如果你们相信我身后皆为信徒

558
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,640
就说“是信徒” 好吗

559
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,890
是信徒

560
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,680
今晚 你们认识到了星光的真面目
Now, y'all heard a lot tonight about who Starlight really is.

561
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,680
但仍然没有看到面具背后 那个真正的禽兽
But you still haven't seen the true monster behind the mask.

562
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,020
事实...
And the truth...

563
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,730
要比你们想象的糟糕得多
...oh, it is so much worse than you could ever imagine.

564
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,150
不好了
Oh, no.

565
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,320
六个月前 星光去了一家诊所
Six months ago, Starlight visited a clinic.

566
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,070
但她并不是去检查身体
She wasn't going for a checkup.

567
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,660
搞什么鬼
What the fuck?

568
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,240
她发现自己怀孕了
She found out that she was pregnant,

569
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,120
跑去做了流产
and she had an abortion.

570
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,830
这些是我他妈的医疗记录吗
Are those my fucking medical records?

571
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:09,170
她从小就是基督徒
She was raised a Christian.

572
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,590
她是明是非的
She knew the difference between right and wrong.

573
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:16,890
她是明知故犯
She knew exactly what she was doing.

574
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,680
所以 怎么能让我相信那些青少年
So you won't tell me that those teens over there,

575
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,140
和她在一起是安全的  她可是个婴儿杀手啊
that they're safe with her. With that baby killer?

576
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,900
安妮 等等
Annie, wait.

577
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,860
你干什么呢
What do you think you're doing?

578
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,820
抱歉 我一定是迷路了
I'm sorry. I must've gotten lost.

579
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,360
- 糟了 - 你是谁
- Fucking hell. - Who are you?

580
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,280
法兰奇
Frenchie. 

581
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,700
太尴尬了 我是鞭炮的铁杆粉丝
It is so embarrassing. I am Firecracker's biggest fan.

582
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,490
我只是想找她的衣服...
I was just looking for a souvenir...

583
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,540
嘿

584
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,500
她不要这个孩子 可以呀 供人收养嘛
She could have given it up for adoption.

585
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,130
但是 不 她谋杀了这孩子
But no. She murdered it.

586
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,590
你终于来...
So you finally came to deb--

587
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,210
居然之前以为我傲慢
How's that for "uppity," cracker?

588
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,800
住手
Stop.

589
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
看
Look.

590
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:48,310
星光暴怒 在直播电视节目上 胖揍鞭炮

591
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,150
走吧
Look.

592
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,900
第一个被拉下马的
First pebble down the mountain.

593
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,190
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

594
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,570
走吧
Come on.

595
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,370
起来
Get up.

596
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,290
比利 快 站起来
Billy, come on, get up.

597
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,250
快点 比利
Come on. Billy.

598
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,630
你不能放弃
You don't get to quit.

599
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,800
起来
Get up!

600
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,810
真他妈的
Fucking hell.

601
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,730
- 怎么搞的  - 妈的
- What the fuck? - Oh, shit.

602
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,690
法兰奇
Frenchie!

603
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,030
不好 我的天 法兰奇
Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Frenchie.

604
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,700
- 这是他妈的怎么了  - 快 我们快走吧
-What the fuck happened? -Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

605
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,790
好的

606
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,460
搞什么
What the fuck?

607
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,640
真有趣 我记得它要比这大得多
It's funny. I-I remember it being so much bigger.

608
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:50,060
你知道为什么 我以前把这里称为“坏房间”吗
You know why I used to call this The Bad Room?

609
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,690
这只是个房间 约翰 它既不好也不坏
It was just a room, John. It's neither good nor bad.

610
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,020
在门外时这么说很容易
That's easy to say from the other side of the door.

611
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,270
现在...
Now... 

612
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,860
你回来就是为了折磨那些人吗
Did you come back here just to torment those people?

613
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,820
是不是感觉有点...
Doesn't that feel a little... 

614
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,700
有点狭隘
a little small?

615
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,950
他们只是在执行 沃格尔鲍姆医生的命令
They were just following orders. Dr. Vogelbaum's, Stan Edgar's and mine.

616
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,330
- 史丹埃德加和我的命令 - 是的 但他们执行了那些命令

617
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,660
Yeah. But they followed them.

618
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,960
没有一个人有勇气 站出来说:“这是错误的”
Not one of them had the backbone to stand up and say, "This is wrong."

619
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,380
- 因为他们害怕 - 我还是个孩子
- 'Cause they were scared. - I was a child. 

620
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,550
他们很害怕
They were scared.

621
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,760
知道嘛
You know...

622
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,640
你出生那天我就在场
I was there the day that you were born.

623
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:30,350
他们付给某个可怜的离家出走的人 两千美元的代孕费
They paid some poor runaway two grand to carry the embryo to term.

624
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,100
但你用激光从里面给她破了肚
But you lasered her guts open from the inside.

625
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,230
你升到空中 脐带还连着
You rose in the air with your umbilical cord still attached,

626
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,360
就像神话中的某种生物一样
like some creature out of myth...

627
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,900
也许是噩梦中的
or nightmare.

628
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,150
你出生时还杀死了 三名医生和一名护士
You killed three doctors and a nurse while you were at it.

629
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,740
此后 相信我 你就一发不可收拾了
And then, just trust me, it was downhill from there.

630
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,030
是的 从你降生起 每个人就都害怕你
So, yeah, yeah, everybody was terrified of you, from your first breath.

631
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,120
但你不怕
But you weren't?

632
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,750
我们没有你强大 从来都没有
We have no physical power over you. We never did.

633
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,210
你可以随时逃离这里
You could've broken out of here anytime you wanted.

634
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,960
我们是无法阻止你的 但你没有
We couldn't have stopped you. But you didn't.

635
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,800
因为你无法忍受
Because you couldn't stand the idea 

636
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,100
我们会对你感到失望的想法
that we would be disappointed in you.

637
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,850
你需要认可和爱
Your need for approval and for love.

638
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,150
沃特请来了世界上最好的心理学家
Vought brought in the best psychologists in the world.

639
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,780
他们制定了方案 仔细地将这种需求植入于你
Developed the protocol to carefully engineer that need

640
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,950
令你听话
so that you would be obedient.

641
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,870
从很多方面来说 那是我们最大的成功
In many ways, that was our greatest success.

642
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,330
我不再需要它了
I don't need any of it anymore.

643
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,670
无论你对这里的其他员工 做什么都没关系
Doesn't matter what you do to me or the rest of the staff here.

644
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,840
你对爱的需求非常之深
Your need for love is so deep, it's so human,

645
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,630
这就是人性 你永远无法克服这一点
you'll never be able to overcome that.

646
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,930
你错就错在这里
That's where you're wrong.

647
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,680
我不是人类 我的儿子也不是
I'm not human. And neither is my son.

648
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,770
我会抚养他长大 让他知道这一点
And I'm going to raise him so that he knows it.

649
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,520
知道嘛
You know, 

650
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,070
我真的很想告诉你 为什么我把这里称为“坏房间”
I really do want to share with you why I called this The Bad Room.

651
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,200
抵抗 #星光

652
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,750
嘿
Hey. Hey.

653
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,630
欢迎回来 你还好吗
Welcome back. You okay?

654
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,300
我觉得我最近总是在帮你包扎 我应该跟你的长官要钱才对
I feel like I've been fixing you up so much lately I should bill your HMO.

655
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,100
- 科林 拜托 - 我得扶你起来 来吧
- Colin, please. - All right, I got to get you up.

656
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,640
科林 好了 请别对我这么他妈的好
Colin, don't, please. Stop! Stop being so fucking nice to me!

657
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,480
那个人是我
It was me.

658
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,820
什么...什么是你
W-What was you?

659
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,540
是你
It was you?

660
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,630
对不起
I'm sorry.

661
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,770
你个该死的变态
You're a fucking psychopath.

662
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,240
来吧
Come on.

663
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,240
动手吧
Do it.

664
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,340
如果你再靠近我
If you come near me again...

665
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,220
我就他妈的杀了你
I'll fucking kill you.

666
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,000
你想见我
Yeah, so, you wanted to see me?

667
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,080
给你买了风味小镇的 炸泡菜和田园沙拉酱
Got you some of those fried pickles and ranch from Flavortown.

668
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,710
- 你就是这么道歉的吗  - 我需要你帮我个忙
- This your way of apologizing? - I need a favor.

669
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:32,170
我不理解你 一点都不理解
I don't get you, dude. Like, at all.

670
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,180
一开始 你就是个彻头彻尾的贱人
You start off, you're a total bitch,

671
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,640
然后你告诉我 我是更为优越的物种
and then you tell me I'm, like, a superior being--

672
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,930
我喜欢那样 然后你想干一炮
which of course I like and that you're down to pound,

673
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,680
- 显然 我会的 - 我知道
-which obviously I will-- -I know.

674
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,100
大多数人
Most people, 

675
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,690
他们的大脑会一直生长到25岁左右 然后就永远停止生长
their brains grow till they're about 25, then stop forever.

676
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,700
我的不是 它不断地再生
Mine doesn't. It regenerates, constantly.

677
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,660
用刀捅进我的心脏 我就死了
Stab me in the heart, I die.

678
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,910
但是刺伤我的大脑 那个该死的小贱人会再长回来
But stab me in the brain and the little fucking bitch grows back.

679
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,160
我要你把这个放进我的体内
I want you to put this inside me.

680
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,550
这是我见过的 最糟糕的假阳具 但是...
That's the worst dildo I've ever seen, but-- 

681
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,010
不 插进我的眼睛里 这里
No. In my eye. Here.

682
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,510
我很想 但是...
I am down for, like, a lot, but...

683
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,600
这是暂时的
It's temporary.

684
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,270
你给我做额叶切除术
You give me a frontal lobotomy

685
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,480
之后的几个小时内 我就他妈的不必做自己了
and I don't have to fucking be me for a couple hours.

686
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,570
太他妈的恶心了
Uh, that's just... fucking gross.

687
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:37,570
我们看金姆和雷的视频时 我会让你把鸡巴插进我的屁眼里干我
I'll let you ass-fuck me while we watch the Kim and Ray J video.

688
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,120
你想把它插进哪里 这里 坐下
Okay, so where do you want me to put it? Just right there? Sit down.

689
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,370
别刺到眼球 我不想失明
Now, avoid the eye itself. I don't want to go blind.

690
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,220
现在...用锤子
Now, use the hammer.

691
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,510
锤子 他妈的
The hammer? Fuck.

692
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,180
轻敲
Tap, tap.

693
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,480
再敲
Again.

694
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,310
- 好了 - 好
- Okay. - Oh, sorry.

695
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,900
锤进去 现在...
Hammer down. Now...

696
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,780
- 刮 - 刮
- Scrape. - Scrape it?

697
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,400
把我该死的脑子刮个稀巴烂
Scrape my fucking brains out.

698
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,740
太怪了
That's weird.

699
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:26,870
好了 你可以把它取下来了
Okay, okay, okay. You can take it out.

700
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,050
天哪 你没事吧
Oh, God... Hey, are you okay?

701
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,630
嘿
So... Hey.

702
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,390
我为你准备了 另一道“风味小镇”的菜
I have another Flavortown for you.

703
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,930
- 我的小穴 - 好啊
- My pussy. - Yes.

704
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:52,690
风味小镇 盖伊菲耶里的厨房

705
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,320
纽曼对星光攻击行为的反应

706
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,490
今天发生的事件 不幸地证实了我的怀疑
Today's events have sadly confirmed my suspicions.

707
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,240
虽然我尊重当选总统辛格尔
While I respect President Elect Singer,

708
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,870
但看到他与星光结盟真是令人沮丧
it's disheartening to see him align himself with Starlight,

709
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,030
她明显是失控了
someone so clearly out of control.

710
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,200
更令人担忧的是
What's even more troubling is 

711
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,040
我把星光当朋友 但是...
that I considered Starlight a friend. But her violent, 

712
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,670
《言语治疗 失语症康复之星练习簿》

713
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,260
《言语治疗》

714
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,070
嘿
Hey.

715
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,280
天哪 你的腿怎么了
Oh, Jesus. What happened to your leg?

716
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,410
没关系 我没事
It's okay. I'm fine.

717
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:45,530
我看到了鞭炮的那件事 那个该死的混蛋
But, look, I saw the Firecracker thing. That fucking asshole.

718
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,330
不 我不应该失去理智
No, no, I shouldn't have lost it.

719
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,410
怎么可能不失去理智  那是最私密的信息
How could you not lose it? That was, like, the most private thing 

720
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,460
只有我们俩知道 居然这样大肆广而告之
between you and me. And to fucking broadcast it like that,

721
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,210
- 简直他妈的没王法了 - 休伊 这样没有帮助 好吗
- that's a fucking violation. - Hughie. It's not helping, okay?

722
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,630
你说得对 对不起 你说得对 我很抱歉 对不起
Right, sorry, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

723
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,010
做出流产的决定 我很痛苦
I agonized over that decision.

724
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,300
痛苦不堪 而且
Agonized. And 

725
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,720
你知道我很痛苦 我只是还没准备好要孩子
you know I did. I just wasn't ready.

726
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,390
我知道 我是说 我也没准备好
I know. I mean, neither was I.

727
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:14,480
现在 人们看着我时 无论他们是支持
And now when people look at me, whether they're...

728
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,360
评判 还是...还是愤怒
supportive or judging or-or angry,

729
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,690
我都必须重新体验那份痛苦
I have to relive it. 

730
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,360
一遍又一遍 我妈...
Over and over and over again. And my mom...

731
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,950
你和她谈过吗
Have you talked to her?

732
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,990
她不肯给我回电话
She won't return my calls.

733
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,330
过来
Okay. Come here.

734
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,420
这不关她的事 好吗
It's none of her business. Okay?

735
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,420
这不关别人的事 只关你的事
It is nobody's business but yours.

736
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,920
该死 对不起 我必须接这通电话
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, I have to take this. 

737
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,760
没关系 我...
It's okay. I, um, 

738
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,470
我得给我爸取点东西
I have to pick up something for my dad.

739
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,510
- 我们稍后再谈 好吗  - 好的
- We'll talk later, okay? - Okay.

740
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,850
- 我爱你 - 我也爱你
- I love you. - Love you, too.

741
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:56,650
喂
Hello?

742
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,730
朋友之间会告知真相 而且...
You know, friends tell friends the truth, and...

743
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:04,360
《超人类控制法案》本会顺利通过
The Supe Control bill would've passed with flying colors.

744
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,740
但是在你今天这出之后呢
But after what you pulled today...

745
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:11,040
不妨称你这出为《变态星光 婴儿杀手将法案扼杀于摇篮中》
might as well call it the Psycho Starlight Baby-Killer bill.

746
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:13,910
你还在听吗
Are you still there?

747
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,710
对不起
I'm sorry.

748
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,420
抱歉并不能挽回 你刚刚毁掉的共和党选票
Sorry doesn't bring back all the Republican votes you just torched.

749
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,840
我不能再和你有任何关系了
I can't be affiliated with you anymore.

750
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,290
之前是胡说八道 对吧
It's bullshit, right? 

751
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,870
你不会原谅我的
You're not gonna forgive me.

752
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,130
我就知道
Yeah. Thought so.

753
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,380
等等
Wait.

754
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,720
你说得对 我...
You're right, I...

755
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,180
我本来想说滚你妈的
I was gonna tell you to go fuck yourself.

756
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,470
但我改变了主意
But I changed my mind.

757
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,690
我们两清了
We're good.

758
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,910
你个该死的混蛋
You fucking dog-wanker.

759
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,540
天哪 你站在那里多久了
Jesus. How long have you been standing there?

760
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,670
反正什么都看到了
Long enough.

761
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,340
你怎么能这么做
How could you?

762
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,760
我没有...我不是为了他才这么做的
I-I didn't, I didn't do it for him.

763
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,470
我不想用自己的一生来憎恨任何人
I don't want to spend the rest of my life hating anybody.

764
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,680
你要用那东西做什么
What you gonna do with that, then?

765
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:02,270
你可能是唯一能理解的人
I mean, you're probably the only guy that would understand,

766
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,070
我要把它给我爸用
but I was going to give it to my dad.

767
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:04,980
休伊
Oh, Hughie.

768
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,280
听着 我知道 我知道这样做很疯狂 也很可怕
Look, I know. I know it's insane and terrible, 

769
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,150
但我还有什么选择呢
but what other choice do I have?

770
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:12,280
只要他妈的别选这个 你个傻瓜
Any other fucking choice, you twat.

771
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,280
你是在告诉我
You're really telling me 

772
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,540
如果你跟我爸处境相同 你不会用它吗
that you wouldn't take some if you were in his shoes?

773
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,160
因为你们俩的处境有点像 这一剂够你们俩用的
'Cause you kind of are. There's enough here.

774
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,830
它也能救你
It'd save you, too.

775
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,500
总比死于脑癌好 对吧
It's got to beat dying of brain cancer, right?

776
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,960
我已经用了
I already took some.

777
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,340
四个月前 从法兰奇的桌子上偷的
Nicked it out of Frenchie's desk four months ago.

778
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,390
以为它可以治愈我
Thought it might cure me.

779
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,310
天哪
Jesus.

780
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,060
你有超能力吗
Do you have powers?

781
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,730
没有 它只是把我的死期提前了
No. All it did was bring up the big day.

782
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,780
告诉你 放弃你要做的事吧
I'm telling you, quit while you're behind.

783
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,360
你只会让事情变得更糟
You'll only make matters worse.

784
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,390
在拖车里时 我是怎么了
What happened to me back there?

785
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,640
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Oh, hey. - Hey.

786
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,520
- 你还好吗  - 没事 只是绊倒了
- You okay? - Yeah, I just tripped.

787
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,690
他怎么样
How is he?

788
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,400
这个嘛
Well...

789
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,360
医生说很快就不行了
The doctor said any time now.

790
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,390
不
No, no.

791
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,430
我...
Um...

792
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,430
我只是需要透透气
I just need some air.

793
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:16,970
给

794
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,200
搞什么
What the fuck?

795
