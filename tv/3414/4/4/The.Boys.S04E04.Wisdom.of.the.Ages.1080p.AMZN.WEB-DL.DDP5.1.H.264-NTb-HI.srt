about her very first save?</i>

480
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,053

<i>But what they don't tell you</i>

484
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:31,025
<i>is that she blinded
one of those hostages that day.</i>

485
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:36,447
<i>A mother of three, just trying to buy
Crunch Berries for her kids.</i>

486
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,117
<i>But Starlight, she just went on,</i>

like none of it ever happened.</i>

00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,150
Taking V, huh?

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,697
What the hell are you doing in here?

Nothing.

[chuckles] You left a floater
in his toilet?

508

That was there when I got here.

That is the most pathetic clapback
that I have ever seen.

And you know, if Homelander knew,

511
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,544
- that'll be the last shit you ever take.
- Oh, yeah?

00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:03,636
If Homelander knew you took that V,
he would flay you alive.

So, what do we do about it?

I'd like to apologize.

For Frank.

00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:48,180
[exhales] Look,
I guess I-I got a little grumpy,

and I-I'm sorry.

524
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,227
Can you forgive me?

525
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,479
Of course.

526
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,857
These things, these things happen.

527
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,570
Thank you. [sniffles]

You were always one of the kinder ones.

That's right, John.

- "Homelander."
- Homelander. We were friends.

00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,036
I was always nice to you.

532
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,705
[laughs] Yeah, that's right.

533
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,957
You were. Mostly.

00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,126
[atmospheric music playing]

535
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,503
Well, you remember the nickname
you had for me, right?

536
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,922
- Mm-mm.
- Really?

537
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,049
"Squirt."

538
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:27,803
[chuckles] Yeah,
you called me Squirt, silly.

539
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,888
You remember why?

540
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,557
No.

541
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,310
Oh, f... Marty, okay.

542
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,520
But you do remember, though,

543
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:39,440
that I used to be left in there

544
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,901
for hours, days on end.

545
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,945
Completely alone. Right?

546
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,698
Only... I was never really alone, was I?

547
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,408
Mm?

548
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,702
- Big Brother was always watching.
- [chuckling]

549
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:55,998
[laughs] You were always watching,
weren't you, Marty?

550
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,666
Huh?

551
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,462
But... growing boys have...

552
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:06,008
certain needs, shall we say?

553
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,762
So I figured out that when
you did your rounds at night,

554
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:14,892
I had about a couple of minutes
to myself to, uh...

555
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,728
well, to, uh, to do what boys do.

556
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,396
[chuckles]

557
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,690
And-and that would be the only time of day

558
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,901
that I would feel anything good.

559
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:28,739
So this one night, uh,
I couldn't get finished in time.

560
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,950
And you caught me with my pants down.

561
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:37,289
You had a really, really good laugh at me.

562
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:39,124
Remember?

563
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,211
That's when you nicknamed me Squirt.

564
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,755
I got to be honest with you, Marty...

565
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,799
[sighs]

566
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,051
...you really hurt my feelings.

567
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:57,768
I am very sorry.

568
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,690
What's done is done.

569
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,651
Water under the bridge.

570
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,819
Ha.

571
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,904
[chuckling] But stay there a sec.

572
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,447
[clears throat]

573
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:16,203
I do want you to jerk off
in front of us right now.

574
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,372
Hey, uh, guys, come on over here.

575
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,624
Come on. Yeah.

576
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:25,129
We're all gonna laugh at you. Okay?

577
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,172
Yeah.

578
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:30,592
That way, you will know how it feels,

579
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,470
and I think I'm gonna feel better.

580
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,984
[nervous laughter]

581
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,947
Homelander...

582
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:56,910
...I am really very sorry.

583
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,162
[Homelander] I know, I know.

584
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,164
Thank you.

585
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,665
Now, don't be shy.

586
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:04,001
Take your pants down.

587
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,586
Now.

588
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,050
Mm-hmm.

589
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,428
That's the spirit.

[hysterical laughter]

592
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:32,154
Marty, it looks like you're shucking
a little mushroom.

593
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,990
- Oh, that poor little thing.
- [grunting]

Cheer for him. Come on.

00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,289
Squirt. Squirt. Squirt.

597
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,542
Aw.

598
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,377
Not off to a great start, huh?

599
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:50,214
Tell you what,
I'll give you a little motivation.

600
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,757
You get hard right now,

601
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,551
or I'm gonna laser your dick off.

602
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,595
Okay?

603
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,223
[snickering]

604
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,059
Something to play for now. Mm?

605
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,144
Use it or lose it, Marty.

606
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:07,314
Your life is literally in your hands.

607
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,901
Come on, Squirt.

608

[Homelander laughing]

609
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,324
Yes!

610
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,828
More spit, Marty, more spit.
That'll work.

611
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:21,912
Come on!

612
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,331
Put your fucking back into it. Attaboy.

613
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,042
I can't.

614
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,378
- Come on, Marty!
- I'm sorry.

615
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,046
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

616
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,716
It's okay. Honestly,
it-it happens to a-a lot of guys.

617
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,220
Truly. Not me, of course.

618
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,681
[chuckles] Ah...

That's a fucking squirt, Marty.

Whoa, whoa! You're getting
dick blood on my boots, Marty.

[maniacal laughter]

625
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,074
[woman] Stop it, John.

626
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,368
Barbara.

627
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:07,457
Um, the cake's melted, I'm afraid.

628
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,502
[sighs] Please put him out of his misery.

[Homelander sighs]

630
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,221
I forgive you, Marty.

[crunching]

632
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,315
Can we talk in private?

633
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,278
[Homelander] That's a great idea.

634
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,697
I know just the place.

635
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:44,286
Um, it's more comfortable in my office.

636
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:49,458
[Homelander] No,
I think in here is better.

637
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,181
[grunting]

638
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:06,767
Kimiko!

639
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,562
Holy shit!

Ah!

644

that we would be disappointed in you.
