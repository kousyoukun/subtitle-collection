1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,840
Who wants their balls crushed?

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,170
Me.

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,640
This isn't what it looks like.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,180
You're done. Grab your shit and get the fuck out.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,770
-The Boys is mine. -Says a dying man with one last bluff.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,190
The Seven is getting even stronger. Put your hands together for Firecracker.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,440
What have I done to make you hate me so much?

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,400
You really don't remember me, do you?

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,860
And Sister Sage!

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,030
Fascist!

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,200
She's the world's smartest person.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,330
You remember Colin Hauser?

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,380
So, what happens when he finds out you murdered his family?

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,630
My dad, he had a stroke.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,340
- I'm really sorry. Really. - Mom?

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,550
I want to flip A-Train. 

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,340
He's right there, he's ready.

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,930
Enough!

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,020
You're never gonna be your true self until you transcend your humanity.

22
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,560
You need to go back to the start.

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,560
You need to go home.

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,580
Hey, Marty.

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,540
The security cameras upstairs just went black.

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,670
Hey, Phil, you copy?

29
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,040
Phil? 

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,840
Anyone up there?

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,010
Call Vought, tell them we have a breach.

32
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,890
The line's dead.

34
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,430
Hello, everyone.

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,180
Hi.

36
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,680
John. - Homelander.

37
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,430
Just Homelander.

38
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,770
Hey, Marty. Good to see you.

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,610
You, too, uh, Homelander.

40
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,530
Oh, my God, this is just so surreal.

41
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,280
I never thought I'd be back here.

42
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,950
So many memories.

43
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,370
Oh, I, uh, I brought a Fudgie the Whale.

44
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,660
Do me a favor, could you get a plate and some forks?

45
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,370
Thank you so much.

46
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,500
I see some new faces.

47
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,630
But a lot that I recognize. Frank.

48
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,090
And-and Assistant Director now, Marty.

49
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,020
I still remember when they had you wiping out the stool sample containers.

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,480
You remember?

51
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,900
Yeah.

52
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,230
Where's Barbara?

53
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,280
-Last I checked, she's still Director? -She's off-site today.

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,820
Oh, bring her in, would you? I'd love to catch up.

55
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,740
Tell her-- Tell her it's a little reunion.

56
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,830
Terrific. All right, everyone, dig in.

57
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,120
Come on, don't be shy. Before it melts.

59
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,540
Please. Come on in. There you go.

62
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,450
What are you doing?

63
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,210
Come on, get up. 

64
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,210
Butcher, the world doesn't end just because your shitty life does.

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Get up.

66
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,260
Get up.

67
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,400
Are you fucking kidding me?!

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm sorry, your father's condition meets the criteria for brain death.

69
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,940
It might not seem like it, but it is the most humane thing.

70
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,320
Humane? You're pulling his feeding tubes so he starves to death, right?

71
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,490
Hughie, it's what he wanted.

72
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,120
How long before, um...

73
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,540
A couple of days at most.

74
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,630
Mom. 

75
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,630
Don't.

76
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,130
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,910
Hughie...

78
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,080
V52 Expo. Come meet The Seven in person,

79
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,710
and get an exclusive sneak peek of Training A-Tr--

80
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,880
Tonight, 8:00/7:00 Central on The Whole Truth...

81
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,130
After their bloody campus rampage, 

82
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,250
Marie Moreau and the other Godolkin Four have seemingly vanished

83
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,760
into a dark, gaping hole.

84
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,800
With his newly announced anti-Superhero legislation,

85
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,220
Bob Singer has just shown the American people who he really is.

86
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,640
A deranged fascist hellbent on ruling the country...

87
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,690
You should hear what they say about me.

89
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,610
Give us the room.

90
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,030
Miss January, the only thing I really want to hear is

91
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,540
"We found a way to kill the head-popping bitch."

92
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,000
-Then this will be a quick meeting. -You need my help, sir.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,210
I read the draft of your Supe-control bill.

94
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,460
Let me guess, it's perfect, but you know just how to fix it.

95
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,510
If you get it passed, that's a stake through Vought's heart.

96
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,810
Gets 'em out of the military, policing, tanks their stock, buries 'em in lawsuits.

97
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,930
See, it sure sounds like I don't need your help.

98
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,850
But that's if you get it passed.

99
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,820
You need-- what?-- 50 million constituents demanding Congress get off its ass?

100
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,190
No offense, but your PR department is kind of shitting the bed.

101
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,950
I just okayed a huge marketing spend.

102
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,450
Yeah, your ad-buys during CSI: Las Vegas are definitely winning over

103
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,500
the "left the TV on 'cause they're dead" demo.

104
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,710
So, 

105
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,130
what is your suggestion?

106
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,460
I can get people into the streets all over the country,

107
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,470
and they'll demand that the bill gets passed.

108
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,340
- You'll do it as Starlight? - Yes.

109
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,760
I'll even make another fucking... 

110
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,640
Supersuit if I have to.

111
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,140
And what do you get for this?

112
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,560
Just a promise.

113
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,980
Promise me you'll finish what you started.

114
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,610
Once and for all... 

115
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,280
we put Vought into the ground.

116
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,340
Colin, what is this?

117
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,380
Oh, who's uncultured now?

119
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,390
Ray Charles, his country western phase.

120
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,770
My dad used to play this all the time in the car,

121
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,730
and I'd fall asleep to it in the backseat.

122
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,940
You never told me about them.

123
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,730
Your family.

124
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,650
It's, uh...

125
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,740
not exactly my favorite story to tell.

126
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
No. D��sol��.

127
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,160
No, it's fine.

128
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,660
When my mom wasn't on my ass for my grades,

129
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,790
she was a federal judge.

130
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,130
She dealt with really violent cases, like, the worst of the worst.

131
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,920
And there was this Russian mafia thing in Brighton Beach.

132
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,800
Their boss was this woman.

133
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,300
My mom was gonna make an example out of her.

134
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,140
So they made an example out of my mom.

135
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,810
Some guy broke in, and they found my parents first.

136
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,440
Then my little sister.

137
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,980
You were there?

138
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,860
The gunshots woke me up.

139
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,280
I heard 'em coming down the hallway, so I just hid under my bed.

140
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,240
All I saw was his ankle.

141
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,750
He had these scars, or these burns maybe.

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,380
Ugh, a lot of nightmares about those.

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,090
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,850
Breakfast?

145
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,530
Hey, how are you? 

146
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,070
Hey, Janet.

147
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,030
Hey, guys, let's call in Stacey and Mark.

148
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,450
We need to get an announcement ready.

149
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,920
What?

150
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,630
What are they doing?

154
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,100
That bitch.

155
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,980
VNN is handling the launch of Firecracker's show,

156
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,610
simulcast across all Vought networks.

157
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,030
The troll farms are already digging up fringe anti-Starlight content

158
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,070
and injecting it into the mainstream.

159
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,450
So far, "Starlight's Progressive Jihad"

160
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,540
and "#ArrogantWhiteFeminism" are showing promise.

161
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,370
We need the algorithm to find the most receptive users,

162
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,880
then blast the articles to the top of their social feeds

163
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,130
until 100 million people are outraged by Starlight

164
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,420
for reasons they can't even explain.

165
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,920
Dope.

166
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,220
Heroes, you have your talking points,

167
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,930
so, everyone, get to it.

168
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,900
- Hey, can we talk? - No.

169
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,650
Hey. So, I was thinking over lunch 

170
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,650
we could order some of those fried pickles from Flavortown,

171
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,360
or just skip straight to the flounder pounder special.

172
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,120
I find you repulsive in a way that's difficult to quantify.

173
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,250
And I'm fucking amazing at quantifying, so...

174
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,130
So, big day. 

175
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,300
You ready?

176
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,960
You have no idea.

177
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,050
-I've been waiting for this my whole life. -One last piece of the puzzle.

178
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,810
Figured this could be your big finish.

179
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,650
You know, when I first met you, I thought you were kind of uppity,

180
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,280
but you're one of the good ones.

181
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,200
Well, we are the new kids in The Seven.

182
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,410
Gotta look out for each other.

184
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,880
Hello, Patriots!

185
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,260
Now, I know a lot of you probably know me from my podcast,

186
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,470
but VNN gave me the next six hours to bring you the truth 

187
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,890
about Starlight and her house of horrors. Where dozens of trafficked children... 

188
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,150
Here, grab your bags and come with me.

189
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,060
- Sweetheart, don't forget this. Here you go. - Okay.

190
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,440
- We'll sneak the kids out through the back. - Okay.

191
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,860
Are you sure about this? 

192
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,490
Yeah. Just please tell Sasha to have them go easy on the room service, okay?

193
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,990
That card is almost maxed out.

194
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,280
- You got it. - Thank you.

195
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,460
Firecracker's celebrity friends are arriving.

196
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,000
I saw Jon Voight.

197
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
What the fuck is he doing here?

198
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,920
Bringing him back in.

199
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,390
No. No, no, no, no, no. I don't trust him.

200
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,430
I don't. And you're insane if you do, okay?

201
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,730
And you can drink yourself to death in whatever dark hole you crawled out of.

202
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,900
-That's a good idea. I might just do that. -Good. 

203
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,400
Okay, wait a minute. Hold on a second, Butcher.

204
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,110
Look, Lord knows I got problems with the guy, too

205
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,450
We both do, but this is bigger than us.

206
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,620
That shit Homelander and Sage are talking about,

207
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,820
that's some end-of-time shit.

208
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,080
Team is shy one total asshole. Now, we need this motherfucker.

209
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,460
- I mean, I'm... - Annie, this is my call. It's done.

210
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,180
Well, all right then.

211
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,970
Happy we got that sorted, eh?

212
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,430
Now, can someone please explain to me

213
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,770
what makes you Firecracker's Moby Cunt?

214
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,270
- I have no idea. - Bollocks.

215
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,570
I don't.

216
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,650
Now, what's our next move?

217
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,910
You get me 50K from the Company, and in three hours

218
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,330
I'll have all the dirt we need on Little Miss Guns and Ammo.

219
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,620
Butcher, there's no way I'm letting you out of my sight with 50 grand. 

220
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,420
All right. But I'm warning you, 

221
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,580
you ain't gonna like it.

222
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,220
And Kanye West!

223
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,140
But first, a sermon by Ezekiel,

224
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,980
Starlight's childhood pastor before she fell from God's grace.

225
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,650
We'll be right back with that, y'all. You stick around.

226
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,730
U.S.A.!

227
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,450
Hey, Frank, come on over.

228
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,830
How about a game of wastepaper basketball?

229
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,580
I'm sorry?

230
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,290
Uh, first of three, and tell you what, make it interesting,

231
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,550
you win, I'll let you knock off early, go see the fam.

232
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,840
Um, okay.

233
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,550
Excellent. I'll start.

234
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,150
You know, I learned this game from you, Frank.

235
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,440
I don't understand.

236
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,530
I once saw you take a shot at a waste basket, 

237
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,280
and you nailed it, and... 

238
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,330
and you don't remember.

239
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,120
-No. -Yeah, well, 

240
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,330
I sure do. 

241
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,460
Yeah, you were sitting there, and, well, I was in this oven here.

242
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,510
And you made the shot. You did a little fist pump to celebrate,

243
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,010
and then you turned up the temperature to see if you could burn my skin.

244
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,390
You remember that, right?

245
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,890
Your turn.

246
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,570
Fun fact. Um, even though my skin didn't char,

247
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,650
it still really hurt.

248
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,530
I mean a lot.

249
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,660
Yeah, I was in there, 

250
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,790
screaming in agony,

251
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,580
and my tears just sizzled away.

252
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,710
Yeah.

253
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,710
I remember there was, 

254
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,300
uh, people standing here taking notes, 

255
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,840
but behind them I saw you make that shot.

256
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,810
It really was a great shot, Frank.

257
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,520
I was just doing my job.

258
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,820
You know, I had nightmares about that exact moment,

259
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,740
and you can't even remember it.

260
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,120
It's funny, isn't it, 

261
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,580
how people can have such a different memory

262
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,040
of the exact same thing.

263
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,580
It's all a matter of perspective, I guess.

264
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,130
Hey, Frank?

265
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,470
This is my last shot. Why don't you go watch from in there?

266
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,260
- John, why don't we-- -"Homelander."

267
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,480
- Get in the oven, Frank. - Please.

268
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,650
Get in the oven or your family goes in with you.

269
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,030
- Please, Homelander, you don't have to do this. - Marty.

270
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Thank you.

271
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,670
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,840
I'm so, so sorry.

273
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,680
You're sorry?

274
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,800
Now?

275
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,970
But why?

276
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,230
You were just doing your job, right?

277
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,650
Don't do this! No.

278
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,920
And I bet you would've won.

279
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,430
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 

280
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,970
I forgive you.

282
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,710
Uh, I don't know, he should be here any minute.

283
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,500
Thanks, by the way, for being my muscle.

286
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,390
Yeah.

287
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,890
What the shit is this?

288
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,180
Where's the talking goatee with the gold chains?

289
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,770
It's okay. I'm the one that called you.

290
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,350
Are you crazy?

291
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,820
Sage is on my ass, stares at me like I'm fucking dinner.

292
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,320
But you thought this was a good time to be seen together?

293
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,030
I need a dose of Compound V, and I need it today.

294
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,120
Is that all? For what?

295
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
What do you care?

296
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,290
Homelander has every vial of V locked up in his apartment.

297
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,000
- Hundreds of them. Nobody gets it. Okay.

298
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,670
Well, he's not gonna miss one vial, then. You got to find a way.

299
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,670
No. It's too dangerous.

300
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,170
No, hey. Fuck that! You owe me.

301
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,260
I owe you? I just saved your fucking life.

302
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,220
Every single fucked up, horrible thing that's ever happened to me, to all of us,

303
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,600
it all started with you, 

304
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,680
'cause you took away someone I loved.

305
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,480
-And now you're gonna give someone I love back. -What?

306
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,020
My dad's about to die.

307
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,860
V is the only thing that can save him.

308
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,990
This is your chance...

309
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,450
...to finally make things right.

310
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,620
What makes you think I give a shit?

311
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,830
You tell me.

312
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,130
If I do this...

313
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,380
we're good?

314
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,550
Forever?

315
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,720
Yes.

316
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,560
What?

319
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,610
Kimiko, I'm sorry, but it's my dad. What else was I supposed to do?

322
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,160
Fuck!

324
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,090
Who the fuck are those guys?

325
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,430
No, I can't. I can't. My ankle.

326
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,060
No, no, no. Oh, Jesus.

327
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,490
Who the fuck are those guys?

328
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Light. Shining Light? Like-- Shining Light. Shining Light?

329
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Why are they after us?

331
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,290
Fuck.

332
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Okay, what do we do?

334
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,760
No, I-I can't run anywhere. I can't.

335
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,070
No, no, no.

336
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,070
Easy. All right.

337
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,570
Okay.

338
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,280
I got it.

340
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,960
? Love lift us up where we belong ?

341
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,550
? Where the eagles cry ?

342
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,430
? On a mountain...

344
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,490
Not a word about that 50 grand 

345
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,910
and what happened to it to Mallory, motherfucker.

346
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,290
Straight up Webweaver's stinky spider?

347
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,450
Heroin enemas don't come cheap, my son.

348
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,170
I'll never unsee that nasty shit.

349
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,330
Well, I fucking warned you, didn't I?

350
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,420
Anyway, don't matter. Got what we needed. Job done.

351
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,550
You ever gonna tell me what happened with that gash on your face?

353
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,650
M, I got a favor to ask.

354
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,650
Think you're in a position to ask for a favor?

355
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,780
If I can't get the job done before I, uh...

356
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,420
I need you to get Ryan away from Homelander.

357
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,790
Oh, Butcher.

358
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,670
I got to be realistic.

359
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,590
Some days I can barely even fucking stand.

360
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,470
Get him out of there. Raise him.

361
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,390
Raise him?

362
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,350
You're the best dad I know, M.

363
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,350
The best fucking anyone.

364
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,060
That might be one of the nicest things you've ever said to me, but...

365
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,980
what if Ryan doesn't want to go?

366
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,490
Then you've got to make him.

367
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,370
White trash walking.

368
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,960
Top-notch show, love.

369
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,130
Just weren't sure whether you wanted us to kneel before your cross or burn it.

370
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,260
Oh, you're those motherfuckers that killed my friend.

371
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,590
Yeah, crying shame, that.

373
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,680
But if it's any consolation, he's up there with God, noshing on his holiest of holies as we speak.

374
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,390
I'm gonna shut your fucking face-- 

375
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,190
All right, all right. Keep your hair on, love.

376
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,150
We just want a little chin wag's all.

377
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,520
- Talk American. - Right.

378
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,070
You remember that magical summer when you was 28,

379
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,400
working as a counselor at the Capes 

380
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,200
for Christ Bible Camp in Davie, Florida,

381
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,410
and you met that lovely 15-year-old boy

382
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,660
who tickled your fancy, and, well, then, tickled more than that, didn't he?

383
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,410
Ring any bells?

384
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,960
Here's a little keepsake snapped by the Broward County Sheriff's Department

385
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,040
that you can stash in your wank bank.

386
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,420
You and your little Bieber edging 

387
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,840
in the back of your RAV4 in the car park of Buca di Beppo.

388
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,090
Whatever voodoo Vought's lawyers pulled to get your statutory charges dropped,

389
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,010
I don't think they're gonna matter too much to your evangelical audience back there.

390
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,060
You're gonna tell us everything you know

391
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,310
about Sage and her grand plan,

392
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,110
or I hit this little tweet button here.

393
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,570
How about I just send it myself?

394
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,790
Fuck around and find out.

395
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,630
"Starlight." That's nine letters,

396
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,460
or is that six... upside down?

397
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,720
"Annie January," 12 letters, that's two more sixes.

398
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,640
6-6-6. What more proof could you possibly need?

399
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,270
I'm sorry, I got to interrupt. I'm so sorry.

400
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,060
I need, I need to make a confession.

401
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,400
A confession?

402
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,360
I need to confess my sins.

403
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,950
Ain't no way to sugarcoat this. I had...

404
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,870
...inappropriate relations

405
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,950
with a sweet young man.

406
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,960
Damn, that smile.

407
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
But that young man, 

408
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,050
he was 15 years old.

409
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,170
But the moment of my greatest weakness was also the moment

410
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:42,310
that pushed me to my eternal salvation.

411
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,680
I was born again,

412
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,180
and my sins were washed away

413
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,350
by the tears of His love.

414
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,110
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!

415
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,740
Now, I-I believe that our Lord Jesus Christ put 

416
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,780
that young man in my life to lead me 

417
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,070
to the path of righteousness.

418
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,530
Oh, my God.

419
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,910
You got to choose to turn in to the light of His love.

420
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,710
And that's what Starlight, she just didn't do.

421
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,960
Y'all ever hear that story about her very first save?

422
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,670
She was only 13 years old,

423
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,340
and, well, a gunman came into Walmart and took hostages.

424
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,560
Well, Starlight, she came in a'blasting.

425
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,640
But what they don't tell you

426
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,230
is that she blinded one of those hostages that day.

427
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,440
A mother of three, just trying to buy Crunch Berries for her kids.

428
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,150
But Starlight, 

429
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,200
she just went on, smiling for those cameras 

430
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,080
like none of it ever happened.

431
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,040
Starlight's no hero.

432
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,120
She never was.

433
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,300
I was still learning how to control my powers, I...

434
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,230
Mademoiselle Annie.

435
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,690
Well, whatever you attempted, 

436
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,280
it seems you have failed.

437
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,110
Not so fast, Frenchie.

438
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,320
Keys to her trailer.

439
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,410
Go give it a toss, will you?

440
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,810
A-Train.

441
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,850
What the fuck are you doing here?

442
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,150
Taking V, huh?

443
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,820
-What the hell are you doing in here? -Nothing.

444
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,870
You left a floater in his toilet?

445
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,290
That was there when I got here.

446
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:56,370
That is the most pathetic clapback that I have ever seen.

447
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,000
And you know, if Homelander knew, that'll be the last shit you ever take. 

448
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,630
Oh, yeah? If Homelander knew you took that V, he would flay you alive.

449
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,470
Looks like we both have a problem.

450
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,930
Looks like we do.

451
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,690
So, what do we do about it?

453
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,370
- Marty. Come here for a sec. - Yeah?

454
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,170
I'd like to apologize.

455
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,210
For Frank.

456
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,180
Look, I guess I-I got a little grumpy,

457
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,390
and I-I'm sorry.

458
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,140
Can you forgive me?

459
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,810
Of course.

460
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,770
These things, these things happen.

461
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,570
Thank you.

462
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,070
You were always one of the kinder ones.

463
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,860
- That's right, John. -"Homelander." 

464
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,110
Homelander. We were friends.

465
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,030
I was always nice to you.

466
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,660
Yeah, that's right.

467
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,990
You were. Mostly.

468
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,540
Well, you remember the nickname you had for me, right?

469
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,790
Really?

470
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,710
"Squirt."

471
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,840
Yeah, you called me Squirt, silly.

472
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,840
You remember why?

473
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,140
-No. -Oh, f-- Marty, okay.

474
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,480
But you do remember, though, that I used to be left in there

475
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,900
for hours, days on end.

476
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,980
Completely alone. Right?

477
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,690
Only... I was never really alone, was I?

478
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,780
Big Brother was always watching.

479
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,870
You were always watching, weren't you, Marty?

480
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,750
But... 

481
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:05,250
growing boys have... certain needs, shall we say?

482
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,760
So I figured out that when you did your rounds at night,

483
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,800
I had about a couple of minutes to myself to, uh...

484
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,970
well, to, uh, to do what boys do.

485
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,310
And-and that would be the only time of day that I would feel anything good.

486
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,730
So this one night, uh, I couldn't get finished in time.

487
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,990
And you caught me with my pants down.

488
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,700
You had a really, really good laugh at me.

489
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,700
Remember?

490
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,210
That's when you nicknamed me Squirt.

491
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,710
I got to be honest with you, Marty...

492
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,500
...you really hurt my feelings.

493
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,640
I am very sorry.

494
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,020
What's done is done.

495
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,650
Water under the bridge.

496
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,480
But stay there a sec.

497
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,570
I do want you to jerk off in front of us right now.

498
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,370
Hey, uh, guys, come on over here.

499
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,580
Come on. Yeah.

500
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,750
We're all gonna laugh at you. Okay?

501
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,130
Yeah.

502
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,260
That way, you will know how it feels, and I think I'm gonna feel better.

503
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,900
Homelander...

504
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,820
...I am really very sorry.

505
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,160
I know, I know.

506
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,530
Thank you.

507
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,080
Now, don't be shy. Take your pants down.

508
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,660
Now.

509
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,670
That's the spirit.

510
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,190
Marty, it looks like you're shucking a little mushroom.

511
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,990
Oh, that poor little thing.

512
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,320
Cheer for him. Come on.

513
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,120
Squirt. Squirt. Squirt.

514
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,370
Not off to a great start, huh?

515
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,960
Tell you what, I'll give you a little motivation.

516
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,840
You get hard right now, or I'm gonna laser your dick off.

517
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,590
Okay?

518
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,760
Something to play for now. Mm?

519
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,100
Use it or lose it, Marty.

520
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,270
Your life is literally in your hands.

521
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,560
Come on, Squirt.

522
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,950
Yes! More spit, Marty, 

523
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,780
more spit. That'll work.

524
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,330
Come on! Put your fucking back into it. Attaboy.

525
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,040
I can't.

526
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,000
Come on, Marty!

527
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,370
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,880
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

529
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,670
It's okay. Honestly, it-it happens to a-a lot of guys.

530
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,460
Truly. Not me, of course.

531
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,560
That's a fucking squirt, Marty.

532
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,020
Whoa, whoa! You're getting dick blood on my boots, Marty.

533
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,280
Stop it, John.

534
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,070
Barbara.

535
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,450
Um, the cake's melted, I'm afraid.

536
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,410
Please put him out of his misery.

537
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,170
I forgive you, Marty.

538
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,230
Can we talk in private?

539
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,020
That's a great idea.

540
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,110
I know just the place.

541
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,700
Um, it's more comfortable in my office.

542
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,200
No, I think in here is better.

543
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,010
Kimiko!

544
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,560
Holy shit!

546
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,830
Oh, shit.

547
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,490
Do you remember?

548
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,740
After you offered me ice cream,

549
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,160
then threw me into that trunk?

550
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,960
You took me to the camp,

551
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,710
dragged me into the fighting pit.

552
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,500
I could either fight

553
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,420
or die.

554
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,430
Then you left me with these.

555
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,350
I hate you.

556
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,710
Kimiko...

560
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,680
Now, y'all heard a lot tonight about who Starlight really is.

561
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,680
But you still haven't seen the true monster behind the mask.

562
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,020
And the truth...

563
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,730
...oh, it is so much worse than you could ever imagine.

564
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,150
Oh, no.

565
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,320
Six months ago, Starlight visited a clinic.

566
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,070
She wasn't going for a checkup.

567
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,660
What the fuck?

568
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,240
She found out that she was pregnant,

569
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,120
and she had an abortion.

570
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,830
Are those my fucking medical records?

571
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:09,170
She was raised a Christian.

572
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,590
She knew the difference between right and wrong.

573
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:16,890
She knew exactly what she was doing.

574
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,680
So you won't tell me that those teens over there,

575
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,140
that they're safe with her. With that baby killer?

576
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,900
Annie, wait.

577
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,860
What do you think you're doing?

578
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,820
I'm sorry. I must've gotten lost.

579
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,360
- Fucking hell. - Who are you?

580
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,280
Frenchie. 

581
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,700
It is so embarrassing. I am Firecracker's biggest fan.

582
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,490
I was just looking for a souvenir...

584
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,500
She could have given it up for adoption.

585
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,130
But no. She murdered it.

586
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,590
So you finally came to deb--

587
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,210
How's that for "uppity," cracker?

588
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,800
Stop.

589
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
Look.

591
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,150
Look.

592
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,900
First pebble down the mountain.

593
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,190
Let's get out of here.

594
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,570
Come on.

595
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,370
Get up.

596
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,290
Billy, come on, get up.

597
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,250
Come on. Billy.

598
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,630
You don't get to quit.

599
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Get up!

600
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,810
Fucking hell.

601
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,730
- What the fuck? - Oh, shit.

602
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,690
Frenchie!

603
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,030
Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Frenchie.

604
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,700
-What the fuck happened? -Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

606
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,460
What the fuck?

607
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,640
It's funny. I-I remember it being so much bigger.

608
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:50,060
You know why I used to call this The Bad Room?

609
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,690
It was just a room, John. It's neither good nor bad.

610
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,020
That's easy to say from the other side of the door.

611
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,270
Now... 

612
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,860
Did you come back here just to torment those people?

613
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,820
Doesn't that feel a little... 

614
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,700
a little small?

615
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,950
They were just following orders. Dr. Vogelbaum's, Stan Edgar's and mine.

617
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,660
Yeah. But they followed them.

618
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,960
Not one of them had the backbone to stand up and say, "This is wrong."

619
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,380
- 'Cause they were scared. - I was a child. 

620
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,550
They were scared.

621
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,760
You know...

622
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,640
I was there the day that you were born.

623
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:30,350
They paid some poor runaway two grand to carry the embryo to term.

624
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,100
But you lasered her guts open from the inside.

625
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,230
You rose in the air with your umbilical cord still attached,

626
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,360
like some creature out of myth...

627
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,900
or nightmare.

628
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,150
You killed three doctors and a nurse while you were at it.

629
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,740
And then, just trust me, it was downhill from there.

630
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,030
So, yeah, yeah, everybody was terrified of you, from your first breath.

631
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,120
But you weren't?

632
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,750
We have no physical power over you. We never did.

633
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,210
You could've broken out of here anytime you wanted.

634
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,960
We couldn't have stopped you. But you didn't.

635
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,800
Because you couldn't stand the idea 

636
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,100
that we would be disappointed in you.

637
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,850
Your need for approval and for love.

638
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,150
Vought brought in the best psychologists in the world.

639
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,780
Developed the protocol to carefully engineer that need

640
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,950
so that you would be obedient.

641
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,870
In many ways, that was our greatest success.

642
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,330
I don't need any of it anymore.

643
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,670
Doesn't matter what you do to me or the rest of the staff here.

644
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,840
Your need for love is so deep, it's so human,

645
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,630
you'll never be able to overcome that.

646
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,930
That's where you're wrong.

647
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,680
I'm not human. And neither is my son.

648
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,770
And I'm going to raise him so that he knows it.

649
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,520
You know, 

650
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,070
I really do want to share with you why I called this The Bad Room.

652
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,750
Hey. Hey.

653
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,630
Welcome back. You okay?

654
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,300
I feel like I've been fixing you up so much lately I should bill your HMO.

655
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,100
- Colin, please. - All right, I got to get you up.

656
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,640
Colin, don't, please. Stop! Stop being so fucking nice to me!

657
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,480
It was me.

658
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,820
W-What was you?

659
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,540
It was you?

660
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,630
I'm sorry.

661
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,770
You're a fucking psychopath.

662
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,240
Come on.

663
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,240
Do it.

664
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,340
If you come near me again...

665
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,220
I'll fucking kill you.

666
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah, so, you wanted to see me?

667
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,080
Got you some of those fried pickles and ranch from Flavortown.

668
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,710
- This your way of apologizing? - I need a favor.

669
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:32,170
I don't get you, dude. Like, at all.

670
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,180
You start off, you're a total bitch,

671
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,640
and then you tell me I'm, like, a superior being--

672
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,930
which of course I like and that you're down to pound,

673
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,680
-which obviously I will-- -I know.

674
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,100
Most people, 

675
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,690
their brains grow till they're about 25, then stop forever.

676
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,700
Mine doesn't. It regenerates, constantly.

677
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,660
Stab me in the heart, I die.

678
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,910
But stab me in the brain and the little fucking bitch grows back.

679
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,160
I want you to put this inside me.

680
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,550
That's the worst dildo I've ever seen, but-- 

681
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,010
No. In my eye. Here.

682
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,510
I am down for, like, a lot, but...

683
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,600
It's temporary.

684
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,270
You give me a frontal lobotomy

685
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,480
and I don't have to fucking be me for a couple hours.

686
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,570
Uh, that's just... fucking gross.

687
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:37,570
I'll let you ass-fuck me while we watch the Kim and Ray J video.

688
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,120
Okay, so where do you want me to put it? Just right there? Sit down.

689
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,370
Now, avoid the eye itself. I don't want to go blind.

690
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,220
Now, use the hammer.

691
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,510
The hammer? Fuck.

692
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,180
Tap, tap.

693
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,480
Again.

694
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,310
- Okay. - Oh, sorry.

695
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,900
Hammer down. Now...

696
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,780
- Scrape. - Scrape it?

697
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,400
Scrape my fucking brains out.

698
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,740
That's weird.

699
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:26,870
Okay, okay, okay. You can take it out.

700
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,050
Oh, God... Hey, are you okay?

701
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,630
So... Hey.

702
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,390
I have another Flavortown for you.

703
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,930
- My pussy. - Yes.

706
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,490
Today's events have sadly confirmed my suspicions.

707
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,240
While I respect President Elect Singer,

708
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,870
it's disheartening to see him align himself with Starlight,

709
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,030
someone so clearly out of control.

710
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,200
What's even more troubling is 

711
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,040
that I considered Starlight a friend. But her violent, 

714
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,070
Hey.

715
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,280
Oh, Jesus. What happened to your leg?

716
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,410
It's okay. I'm fine.

717
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:45,530
But, look, I saw the Firecracker thing. That fucking asshole.

718
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,330
No, no, I shouldn't have lost it.

719
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,410
How could you not lose it? That was, like, the most private thing 

720
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,460
between you and me. And to fucking broadcast it like that,

721
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,210
- that's a fucking violation. - Hughie. It's not helping, okay?

722
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,630
Right, sorry, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

723
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,010
I agonized over that decision.

724
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,300
Agonized. And 

725
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,720
you know I did. I just wasn't ready.

726
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,390
I know. I mean, neither was I.

727
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:14,480
And now when people look at me, whether they're...

728
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,360
supportive or judging or-or angry,

729
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,690
I have to relive it. 

730
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,360
Over and over and over again. And my mom...

731
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,950
Have you talked to her?

732
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,990
She won't return my calls.

733
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,330
Okay. Come here.

734
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,420
It's none of her business. Okay?

735
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,420
It is nobody's business but yours.

736
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,920
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, I have to take this. 

737
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,760
It's okay. I, um, 

738
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,470
I have to pick up something for my dad.

739
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,510
- We'll talk later, okay? - Okay.

740
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,850
- I love you. - Love you, too.

741
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:56,650
Hello?

742
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,730
You know, friends tell friends the truth, and...

743
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:04,360
The Supe Control bill would've passed with flying colors.

744
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,740
But after what you pulled today...

745
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:11,040
might as well call it the Psycho Starlight Baby-Killer bill.

746
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:13,910
Are you still there?

747
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,710
I'm sorry.

748
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,420
Sorry doesn't bring back all the Republican votes you just torched.

749
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,840
I can't be affiliated with you anymore.

750
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,290
It's bullshit, right? 

751
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,870
You're not gonna forgive me.

752
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,130
Yeah. Thought so.

753
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,380
Wait.

754
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,720
You're right, I...

755
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,180
I was gonna tell you to go fuck yourself.

756
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,470
But I changed my mind.

757
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,690
We're good.

758
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,910
You fucking dog-wanker.

759
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,540
Jesus. How long have you been standing there?

760
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,670
Long enough.

761
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,340
How could you?

762
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,760
I-I didn't, I didn't do it for him.

763
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,470
I don't want to spend the rest of my life hating anybody.

764
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,680
What you gonna do with that, then?

765
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:02,270
I mean, you're probably the only guy that would understand,

766
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,070
but I was going to give it to my dad.

767
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:04,980
Oh, Hughie.

768
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,280
Look, I know. I know it's insane and terrible, 

769
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,150
but what other choice do I have?

770
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:12,280
Any other fucking choice, you twat.

771
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,280
You're really telling me 

772
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,540
that you wouldn't take some if you were in his shoes?

773
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,160
'Cause you kind of are. There's enough here.

774
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,830
It'd save you, too.

775
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,500
It's got to beat dying of brain cancer, right?

776
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,960
I already took some.

777
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,340
Nicked it out of Frenchie's desk four months ago.

778
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,390
Thought it might cure me.

779
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,310
Jesus.

780
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,060
Do you have powers?

781
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,730
No. All it did was bring up the big day.

782
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,780
I'm telling you, quit while you're behind.

783
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,360
You'll only make matters worse.

784
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,390
What happened to me back there?

785
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,640
- Oh, hey. - Hey.

786
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,520
- You okay? - Yeah, I just tripped.

787
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,690
How is he?

788
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,400
Well...

789
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,360
The doctor said any time now.

790
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,390
No, no.

791
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,430
Um...

792
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,430
I just need some air.

794
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,200
What the fuck?
