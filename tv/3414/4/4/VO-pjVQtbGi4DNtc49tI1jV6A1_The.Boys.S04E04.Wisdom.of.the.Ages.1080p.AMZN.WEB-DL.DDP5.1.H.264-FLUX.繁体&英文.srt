And you made the shot. You did a little fist pump to celebrate,

243
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,010
然后 你{高了t 看自己是否灼我的皮w
and then you turned up the temperature to see if you could burn my skin.

244
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,390
@事你得吧
You remember that, right?

246
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,570
有趣的是 M管我的皮w]有焦
Fun fact. Um, even though my skin didn't char,

247
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,650
但仍然感到很痛
it still really hurt.

248
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,530

Yeah, I was in there, 

250
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,790
痛苦地尖叫
screaming in agony,

251
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,580
眼I立刻就嘶嘶地汽化了
and my tears just sizzled away.

252
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,710
是的
Yeah.

253
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,710
我得
I remember there was, 

254
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,300

255
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,840
但越^他 我看到你把|西投M了t

256
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,810
那一投棒O了 弗m克
It really was a great shot, Frank.

257
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,520
我只是在做自己的工作
I was just doing my job.

258
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,820
那一刻我做了很多噩
You know, I had nightmares about that exact moment,

259

260
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,120
很可笑 不是 τ...
It's funny, isn't it, 

261
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,580
完全相同的事情 人居然
how people can have such a different memory

262
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,040
能有截然不同的
of the exact same thing.

263
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,580
我想都是因橐角不同吧
It's all a matter of perspective, I guess.

264
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,130
弗m克
