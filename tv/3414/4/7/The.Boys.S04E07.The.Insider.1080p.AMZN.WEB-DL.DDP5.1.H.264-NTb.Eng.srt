1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,750
Oh, you got to really get it up in there, dawg.

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,340
Some sins deserve eternal damnation.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,140
I've committed murders.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,720
Inmate refused visitation.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,810
No!

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,190
A panic attack. Whatever you're doing, stop it.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,070
They killed Cameron Coleman because

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,210
they thought that he was the fucking leak. I'm done.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,900
Cameron Coleman wasn't the leak.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,690
So, either Sage was lying to you,

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,650
or she's as useless as tits on a mouse.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,280
I'd do anything for you.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,240
That's my boy.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,030
I hate you.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,580
Kimiko!

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,930
Victoria here, she's an integral part of the plan.

17
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,750
We'll handle Singer after the election's certified.

18
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,130
We need plausible deniability when the 25th is invoked.

19
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,250
You're talking about a coup.

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,800
You give us a list of what you need to extract the virus, and make it

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,980
strong enough to top Homelander.

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,340
We're not just talking about killing Homelander,

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,850
we're talking about killing every Supe on Earth.

24
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,140
No one ever said nothing about genocide.

25
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,930
What the fuck's that supposed to mean, "you're me"?

26
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,810
You got a big old fat V'd-up brain tumor, you cunt,

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,320
which is why you are seeing me in the first place.

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,030
I am you.

29
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,920
Well, Merry Christmas, A-Train!

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,840
Oh, Merry Christmas, Ryan.

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,140
Why the long face?

32
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,180
Antifa.

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,600
What's that?

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,770
Well, Ryan, it's a word for people

35
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,900
who hate superheroes and America

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,360
even more than they hate Christmas.

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,600
Well, what do they look like?

38
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,280
That's the problem. They can look like anyone,

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,410
your neighbors, your teachers, even your mom and dad.

40
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,600
Uh, Tommy, can we cut out for a second?Uh, that's a cut on rehearsal.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,870
That's a cut.

42
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,270
Back in 20, everyone.

43
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,890
Hey, is everything okay?

44
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,020
I mean, yeah, it's just...

45
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,150
we're telling kids to report on their own parents.

46
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,730
The lyrics were approved by your dad. Personally, so...

47
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,860
Right. Right, yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,700
Right.Yeah. It's no problem.

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,330
I just need to go 10-1.

50
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,620
Yeah.

51
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,090
PR made that apology to Temple Beth El,

52
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,570
so that should be a done fucking deal.

53
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,760
Um, secondly, we've got a...

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,470
I thought the meeting started at 11:00.

55
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,760
We moved it up.

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,930
Um, next.

57
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,690
Oh, marketing would like to start selling these NFTs of you.

58
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,360
Apparently, you're not just buying JPEGs, you're joining a community.

59
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,610
Ashley.Yes, sir?

60
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,940
Get out.Yes, sir.

61
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,950
Sorry, sir. Yes, absolutely.

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,710
Sage...

63
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,960
who's the leak?

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,460
We're making inquiries.

65
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,090
It's a process, we're eliminating...

66
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,490
I assume you know what that is.

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,300
It's a bug.Specifically William Butcher's bug.

68
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,850
They probably heard every single word we said at Tek-Knight's.

69
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,310
And likely killed him.

70
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,350
They won't go public with the information.

71
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,270
And why not?Because it would short-circuit

72
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,440
everything they really want,

73
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,270
which is to quietly take out Neuman once and for all.

74
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,190
We should slaughter Butcher and his whole fucking team.

75
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,490
Now that is a great idea, sir.

76
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,820
Butcher will be dead in a few months anyway.

77
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,660
And this close to go-time, I wouldn't stir up shit with the CIA.

78
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,410
Yes, yes, yes. Your illustrious fucking plan.

79
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,000
We killed Cameron Coleman for no reason.

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,420
A speed bump but, ultimately, harmless.

81
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,250
Cameron golfed with Mike Lindell,

82
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,050
who just pulled 50 million bucks worth of pillow commercials.

83
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,170
You call that harmless?

84
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,340
Oh, look at Daisy Duck Dynasty doing math.

85
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,680
You know, Firecracker and I have been talking.

86
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,850
Stimulating, I'm sure.

87
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,980
Sorry.

88
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,690
You have brains, Sage,

89
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,810
but I have wisdom.

90
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,480
And what happens if those brains of yours

91
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,110
get blown out again, leaving you

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,610
talking like a gibbering idiot?

93
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,160
Firecracker and I will find the leak.

94
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,300
With respect, the last time...

95
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,120
Respect? I don't hear no fucking respect.

96
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,040
In fact, I am personally offended

97
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,540
by the way you are talking to this great man.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,130
You just focus on the shooter,

99
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,630
make sure he's good to go on the sixth.

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,390
He'll be ready.

101
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,180
Good.

102
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,010
You may leave.

103
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,730
This one's called The World's Our Oyster.

104
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,150
"Shimmering forests of kelp

105
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,820
Like nature's car wash brushes

106
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,070
At the dark bottom, jellyfish glow

107
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,860
Like frat house lava lamps

108
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,030
I can swim you anywhere

109
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,910
The seven seas, one big wet road."

110
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,990
Jesus, Kevin.

111
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,210
You really have the soul of a poet.

112
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,790
Stop.

113
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,170
You're so bad.

114
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,960
And, God, your tongue

115
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,880
is like an outboard motor.Yeah?

116
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,090
I came so many times.

117
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,010
Really?

118
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,520
I, uh, I got to go, babe.

119
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,820
What? You do?

120
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,320
Duty calls.

121
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,910
Wait. No, no. Wait.

122
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,660
Come on, babe. You know you can't be out of water for long.

123
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,410
No, you promised me you'd move me into the tank above the bed.

124
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,000
Right, no. Of course, babe. A hunny percent.

125
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,000
I just got to, uh, you know, clear out the freshwater exotics first,

126
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,670
and then it'll be all set.

127
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,210
Oh, and I got a notes call with Shia

128
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,970
on his new draft of Honey Boy 2. It's really starting to sing.

129
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,640
Well, can I move in tomorrow?

130
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,430
Yeah, totally.

131
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,720
Just like that, I'm supposed to pick up and leave?

132
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,180
Christmas in the desert. Terrific.

133
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,650
You're safer with Gen in Sedona, okay?

134
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,610
Some... things might happen soon.What do you mean?

135
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,070
What... what kind of things?

136
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,190
It's better you don't know.

137
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,400
You call me out of the blue...I have called you

138
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,870
every day for weeks. This is the first time you've picked up.

139
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,700
You know, they kicked me out of the Tuesday Bible group.

140
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,310
That has nothing to do with me.No?

141
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,250
Well, I heard Shelly whisper, "How the heck did Donna raise that girl?"

142
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,750
Okay, just hit the road first thing tomorrow...

143
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,380
"That she would have an abortion?"

144
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,260
You're supposed to be held to a higher standard.

145
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,850
That's how I raised you.

146
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,850
Girls all over the world look up to you.

147
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,830
And now they think they can be loose, because there's no consequences...

148
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,430
That is none of your business,

149
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,440
and it sure as fuck isn't Shelly's.

150
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,360
You're Starlight. You're a superhero.

151
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,690
I'm a person.

152
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,400
Right now, none of that Starlight shit matters.

153
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,280
Then why did Hughie save the suit?

154
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,910
I am so, so sorry.

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,040
That is so fucked.

156
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,180
I pulled it from the trash.

157
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,230
I mean, I thought you might regret tossing it someday.

158
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,630
I don't even like looking at it.

159
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,260
Okay. All right.

160
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,630
Done. I am... There it goes.

161
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,550
It is...

162
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,260
out of here.

163
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,560
I just...

164
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,020
God. I just, I didn't...

165
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,610
want to bring a baby into a world that's ending.

166
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,990
Hughie. It's just...

167
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,200
...it's just all too much.

168
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,330
I mean, there are so many fucking dumpster fires.

169
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,340
Where do we even start?

170
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,380
We just take it step by step.

171
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,840
You smell like you've been drinking.

172
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,450
I don't know what you want from me, all right?

173
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,450
I got here as fast as I could...I want you to do your fucking job.

174
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,770
Whatever.

175
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,750
You really think this could be our Lee Harvey?

176
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,900
That's what A-Train says. I say we visit him, too.

177
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,970
Where the fuck you been?

178
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,660
Shittin' a kidney.

179
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,540
All right, listen up.

180
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,080
Now, don't get your knickers in a twist, but...

181
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,960
...you remember Neuman's dearly departed

182
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,970
virus bloke? Dr. Sameer Shah?

183
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,930
I'm serious, Butcher. Don't.

184
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,550
Well, funny story.

185
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,310
Turns out he ain't that dead.

186
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,060
He's been working for me, making some more of that virus.

187
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,310
What the fuck?

188
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,060
Wait, all they found was...

189
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,270
Goddamn it, you asshole.Did you cut off his leg?

190
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,090
All right, all right, keep your hair on.So, basically,

191
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,740
you've been amputatin' motherfuckers while working on a secret bioweapon,

192
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,510
and we're the ones that are supposed to chill?

193
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,030
You are pissing away our best shot.

194
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,880
Now, the trouble is, we've hit a slight snag.

195
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,370
He can't make it deadly enough to top Homelander

196
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,830
without causing a, you know,global pandemic.

197
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,000
Jesus.

198
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,090
Wait.

199
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,210
Genocide.

200
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,760
You're talking about Supe genocide. That's...

201
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,180
Yeah, Butcher, even for you...

202
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,550
Which is why I'm fucking telling you, innit?

203
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
You think I want that much blood on me hands?

204
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,930
Yeah, you do. You want to fucking swim in it.

205
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,060
No, I don't.

206
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,060
No, I do not.

207
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,110
So, to keep the bug from burning through you lot like wildfire,

208
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,190
I thought ol' Sameer could do with

209
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,450
a bit of a hand.From who?

210
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,330
A question both insightful and germane, my son.

211
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,910
Ah, here he is. Speak of the devil.

212
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,340
Bonjour.

213
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,850
How the fuck did you get out?

214
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
I had Mallory pull a few strings.

215
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,030
Just to be clear,

216
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,180
this was against my will.

217
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,140
I'd rather fuck a jar of fishing lures than to be free.

218
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,350
Oh, cool. Cool.

219
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
All right, then.

220
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,850
Happy reunions. So,

221
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,770
Frenchie will help sort the virus.

222
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,030
We'll use it on Homelander and the VP and that's it, no one else.

223
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,530
You fucking coward.

224
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,870
Okay, that works.

225
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,080
Kimiko, Frenchie, you two are on Dr. Shah.

226
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,960
The rest of you, on the mystery man.

227
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,490
"Don't be a cunt."

228
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,850
Listen...You should... go on ahead.

229
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,970
You what?

230
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,600
Without me. I gotta talk to Monique. It's...

231
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,060
Oh, come off it.

232
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,730
Don't leave me alone with this lot.

233
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,150
Wait, what?

234
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,960
He ain't going.You're not going? Why?

235
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,780
All right, so we gonna make this official?

236
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,780
Take a knee,I'll knight you with my dick.

237
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,030
You're back in charge of The Boys again, all right?

238
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,240
I'm better off doing research anyway.

239
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,450
No, you can't do this.

240
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,870
You don't got to do this.

241
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, he does. This is good for us.

242
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,790
You can't. Things are bad already

243
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,230
without this fucking asshole back.

244
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,090
Look what I got to deal with.

245
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,610
Listen, it ain't a debate, you guys.

246
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,510
I passed out.

247
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,220
During a mission.

248
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,470
I ain't cut out to be skipper.

249
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,640
But he is.

250
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,850
So, it's him. It's you.

251
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,060
End of story.

252
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,490
Hey, come in, baby.

253
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,860
Okay, babe...

254
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,910
Here, take this.

255
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,240
That's $10,000 cash.

256
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,140
The rest of my accounts, I transferred into yours.

257
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,290
Marvin...

258
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,560
Here's two one-way tickets to Belize.

259
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,890
You and Janine's flights are tonight.

260
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,120
Now, it's not forever,

261
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,290
just until things blow over.Stop.

262
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,130
Just stop.

263
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,510
Okay? Tell me what's wrong.

264
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,340
Something big's about to go down.

265
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,890
If we lose, shit's gonna get crazy.

266
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,850
If we win, shit's gonna get even crazier,

267
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,350
so either way, y'all got to go.

268
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,180
And I'm sorry to make you have to pick up and leave again,

269
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,390
but I got one fucking job to do,

270
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,400
and that's to keep you and Janine safe,

271
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,690
and I'll be damned if I let any of this fucking sh...

272
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,290
I know how hard you try, Marvin,

273
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,160
taking care of Janine and me.

274
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,170
Come with us.

275
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,920
I believe you.

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,090
If you did all this, I...

277
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,800
...I'm sure it's even worse than I'm imagining.

278
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,640
So let's go.

279
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,260
The three of us, let's go be a family.

280
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,690
Monique...

281
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,190
you know that you and Janine are my heart,

282
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,560
right?

283
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,980
I can't.Look at you.

284
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,070
That panic attack was supposed to be a warning, Marvin.

285
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,150
Meet us at the airport...

286
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,410
...and this time tomorrow,

287
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,160
baby, we'll be sipping rum punches

288
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,410
on the beach while Janine dodges the waves.

289
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,720
For over a decade, one man has been a voice you can trust.

290
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,640
And now that voice is gone.

291
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,220
Cameron Coleman has died of a brain aneurism

292
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,640
as a direct result of the flu vaccine.

293
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,350
Gone from this world, but never gone from our hearts.

294
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,000
Once again, tragedy...

295
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,570
Hey. What happened to your assistant?Oh, Gregory? I fired him.

296
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,380
Dumb fuck could never get my Sweetgreen order right.

297
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
What do you want?

298
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,360
Listen. They know Cameron's not the leak...

299
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,490
Shut the fuck up. I don't want to hear that shit anymore.

300
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,700
You leave me the fuck out of that. I'm done.

301
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,870
You're shitfaced?

302
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,080
I am still the CEO of this company,

303
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,800
and if the CEO wants to get shitfaced at 11:00 a.m., I can.

304
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,590
He was the best.

305
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,380
He was the fucking best assistant I ever fucking had.

306
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,180
And I fired him to get him away from this fucking place.

307
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,270
I had Cameron killed. I had him killed.

308
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,810
Look, you saved my life.

309
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,310
I could've done that some other way.

310
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,400
He didn't have to die.

311
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,480
It's-it's so easy to become a monster around here.

312
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,070
What if we left? Huh?

313
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,370
What if we left?

314
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,080
You and me?

315
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,710
I don't mean us fucking... ew, no.

316
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,330
I spent my junior year abroad in Florence, we could just go, we could go.

317
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,790
You have a passport.All right.

318
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,560
Oh, you don't need a passport. You just run...Hey, Ashley. Ashley.

319
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,840
Get your shit together.

320
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,050
Okay? You cannot be all wasted running your fucking mouth,

321
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,600
not when you have both of our lives in your fucking hands.

322
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,430
Button it up.

323
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,680
Now.

324
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,960
All right. I'll have a dekko around the back,

325
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,290
you two take the front, yeah?

326
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,250
And then we'll pay the shooter a visit.

327
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,560
You know, I have been racking my brain...

328
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,230
trying to figure out when you got this soft spot for Supes.

329
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,610
Was it when you shot your load and cream-pied Maeve?

330
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,700
All right, you know what?

331
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,040
Enough with the silent treatment, you stubborn prick,

332
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,500
I am done fucking around with you.

333
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,500
See, I know you don't care about Starlight or Kimiko.

334
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,250
Not really. And Ryan?

335
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,380
He's not even yours.

336
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,300
So, tell me...

337
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,140
what justifies the faith in the kid?

338
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,060
I gave her my word.

339
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,600
Becca? Really?

340
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,560
If your love was so perfect and pure...

341
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,940
...then why'd you fuck that waitress?

342
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,820
I fucked up, all right.

343
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,330
And I quit the booze the next day, didn't I?

344
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,790
Yeah.

345
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,910
I can't help but notice you've been quitting the quitting lately.

346
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,880
You know, you keep saying that you're doing all this to honor Becca's memory.

347
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,380
You never did that when she was alive.

348
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,630
So, don't you think it's time to cut the shit?

349
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,840
Fuck off, cunt.

350
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,120
All clear.

351
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,170
Except for literal used tampons in the toilet.

352
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,130
Guys... Secret Service files.

353
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,970
Detail assignments for January 6th.What?

354
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,030
It's a map of the D.C. Fairgrounds where Singer's having his rally.

355
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,740
That's where they're giving him the old Dealey Plaza.

356
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,900
M was right.

357
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,890
Oh, my God.

358
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,270
Oh, thank God you're here.

359
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,390
He killed my husband.

360
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,190
He held me for days.

361
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,440
Wait.

362
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,230
Are you...?

363
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,950
Yeah. Yeah, hi.

364
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,950
Oh, my God. You are... burning up. Are you okay?

365
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,370
It's like a furnace in there.

366
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,870
Okay. Let's get you some help. Yeah?

367
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,330
Come on.

368
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,170
Fuck! Stop!

369
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,210
Oi!

370
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,280
What the fuck?So gross. Ugh!

371
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,070
Fuck!Do you see anything?No.

372
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,200
Fucking Supe shapeshifters.

373
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,280
I hate those cunts.

374
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,660
Got to hand it to Sage though...

375
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,290
perfect choice for the job.

376
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,850
Wait, wait, wait. So we're saying that they could be anyone?

377
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,880
How the fuck are we supposed to save the president

378
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,250
if the killer could be anyone?

379
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,130
By not shitting our panties.

380
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,510
Hughie, wait a minute.

381
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,090
Oh, my God. You need stitches.

382
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,220
I'll go to urgent care, okay?I'll go with you.

383
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,470
No, no, um, go back up there, get those plans before...

384
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,290
whoever gets back, all right? I'll catch up with you later.

385
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,600
Okay. I love you.Love you.

386
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,610
Printed-out boarding pass?

387
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,990
Damn, what are you, 87?

388
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,330
The fuck are you doing here?

389
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,930
You took the words right out of my mouth.

390
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,200
See, I ran by that shithole earlier.

391
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,710
I saw Butcher, Hughie and Starlight going in.

392
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,920
But one motherfucker was conspicuously absent.

393
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,300
So... this is it?

394
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,890
You think I don't want to just peace out to Belize,

395
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,890
sip a daiquiri, smash the local talent?

396
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,640
Get on Priceline then, motherfucker.

397
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,980
Hey. This shit ain't over.

398
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,560
It's over for me.

399
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,860
I've given enough.

400
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,150
Maybe I deserve to be fucking happy.

401
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,690
You know, when I carried your ass to the ER,

402
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,400
there was a kid there.

403
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,030
His eyes were like...

404
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,370
"Holy shit."

405
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,870
Looking at me...

406
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,290
...like I was a hero.

407
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,670
There were no screaming fans, no cameras.

408
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,090
Nobody even knew.

409
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,130
Except for this one kid.

410
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,260
That felt better than anything that I'd ever done at Vought.

411
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,730
Because for once...

412
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,940
I didn't hate myself.

413
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,030
That's on you.

414
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,910
A-Train, you don't get it, do you, man?

415
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,040
This fight that we're in?

416
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,410
This never fucking ends.

417
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,000
It killed my father. It killed his father.

418
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,500
And look at what it's doing to me.

419
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,630
It's tearing me the fuck apart.

420
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,220
Just like it did them.

421
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,100
You know, I look in the mirror...

422
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,180
and I don't even see myself no more.

423
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,560
I got nothing left.

424
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,900
Except my family.

425
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,820
You think Homelander and Vought...

426
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,160
...and all of this shit ain't coming to Belize?

427
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,790
This whole fucking world?

428
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,000
Where's your family gonna go then?

429
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,150
Thanks.

430
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,570
After you eat,

431
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,030
we'll adjust your centrifugation numbers.

432
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,250
I think peut-etre we should try a glycerol gradient.

433
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,790
This, uh...quote-unquote "lab" can't produce what he wants.

434
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,290
What we all want.

435
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,920
Homelander... fini, do we not?

436
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,970
You know, you worked in the finest lab with the best equipment,

437
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,510
but moi?

438
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,060
I have worked in filthy basements with equipment

439
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,270
from dumpsters and dollar stores.

440
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,850
Necessity is the MILF of invention.

441
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,020
You know, um, he would talk to people who weren't here.

442
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,490
Your friend.

443
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,780
Some music, perhaps?

444
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:44,080
I noticed you enjoy truly revolting garbage from the 1990s.

445
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,960
Help you work.Bon appetit.

446
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,670
This virus.

447
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,220
It's just for Homelander, right? Not for Vicky?

448
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,140
Ryan, it's Dad.

449
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,730
Hey, listen, buddy, I-I'm sorry I've been so busy lately,

450
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,230
but I hear you're having some issues

451
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,900
with the-the puppet show thing.

452
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,520
Um, look, I got a lot going on here,

453
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,440
buddy, so, uh, do me a favor,

454
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,780
just-just-just suck it up and-and do it, all right? For me.

455
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,530
Terrific. Love you. Great. Bye.

456
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,780
Are you absolutely sure

457
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,410
that he is the leak?

458
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,960
The little shit broke wide open. He confessed to everything.

459
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,380
Sir.Webweaver.

460
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,910
Ew, what the fuck?

461
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,510
Ew.I'm sorry.

462
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,810
Happens when I'm nervous.

463
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,140
Oh, fuck.Ain't got to be nervous, just...

464
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,400
go on, tell him what you told me. I know.

465
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,980
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,480
Yes, sir.

467
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,730
Whatever you want to know.

468
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,360
How does it work?

469
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,700
There's a hole in the suit so the webs can get out...

470
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,870
No. No. How does it work with William Butcher?

471
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,620
Yeah, well, uh... He-he...

472
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,910
he comes to me.

473
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,660
I tell him what he wants to know.

474
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,520
Oh, for God sakes.

475
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,210
That's just embarrassing.Just shut the fuck up.

476
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,050
Now, one of Butcher's crew

477
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,090
was wearing your nasty-ass suit to Tek-Knight's.

478
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,600
Did you give it to them?

479
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,310
I'm not proud of it.

480
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,810
There it is.

481
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,160
Help me out with something here.

482
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,860
Few weeks back,

483
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,960
how did you know where I was meeting Victoria Neuman?

484
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,240
Look, I-I messed up. I know, I know...

485
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,820
I'm sorry.

486
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,370
I...

487
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,080
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

488
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,170
I... I don't feel very good.

489
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,830
You ever meet this British guy?

490
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,500
He's a liar.Hmm.

491
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,670
He fucks with your brain.

492
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Feeble brains, maybe.Yes.

493
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,760
Feeble. I'm all fucked up.

494
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,180
I screwed you.

495
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,970
I'm so, so sorry.

496
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,310
I'll make you proud. I swear to God.

497
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,190
Oh, buddy, what am I gonna do with you?

498
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,570
Jesus.Oh, stop.

499
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,410
Wait, wait!

500
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,290
What?It wasn't me.

501
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,040
No, please.

502
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,800
Thank you, Firecracker.

503
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,350
You bet.

504
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,610
For Noel.It's not much.

505
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,330
I've missed you.

506
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,760
I came every day. You wouldn't see me.

507
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,100
I was ashamed.

508
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,060
For what you did to Colin and his family.

509
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,690
You told a lot to Annie. The rest I pieced together.

510
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,230
Then you know why I had to turn myself in.

511
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,700
You're exhausting.

512
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Sorry.

513
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,830
You always do this. All moody.

514
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,040
Torturing yourself.

515
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,450
What else was I supposed to do?

516
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,000
Ask for help. Come to me for help.

517
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,580
You can't help.You don't understand.

518
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:05,380
Do you know why I can't speak?

519
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,590
You watched Shining Light kill your parents.

520
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,390
Your brother told me.

521
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,310
I never told Kenji the truth.

522
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,110
It was my first night at the camp.

523
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,070
We move like ghosts.

524
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,990
In silence.

525
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,030
So will you.

526
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,320
So the first girl to cry out?

527
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
She loses.

528
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,960
You ready?

529
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,020
I murdered her without making a sound.

530
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:09,610
Then when I was allowed to speak again...

531
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
I couldn't.

532
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,790
You did not have a choice.

533
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,790
Of course I did.

534
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,880
Better they kill me, than what I did to that girl.

535
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,630
What I did to lots of girls.

536
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,110
I look in the mirror and hate what I see.

537
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,480
So I understand,

538
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,900
more than you know.

539
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,820
You should not hate yourself.

540
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,370
Then neither should you.

541
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,140
How can we possibly forgive ourselves?

542
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,510
How can we move on?

543
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,740
When the virus is ready, we should set him free, no?

544
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,250
Butcher won't be happy.

545
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,960
Then it must be the right thing to do.

546
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,260
Babe, that you?

547
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,390
Yeah, babe.

548
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,680
Can you pick me up some Sugarfish?

549
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,260
No. We've talked about this.

550
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,270
I can't take part in the slaughter of albacore.

551
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,980
One of my ride-or-dies is an albacore.

552
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,850
Okay, so I don't get to stay where I want

553
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,360
or eat what I want.

554
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,870
What's that supposed to mean?

555
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,320
"Sometimes the way you get them is the way you lose them."

556
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,860
Why are you quoting Lisa Vanderpump?

557
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,990
I know about Sage.

558
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,410
What are you talking about? Sage?

559
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,870
Don't patronize me, Kevin. I've known for a while.

560
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
My suckers can smell her on you

561
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,580
after your trysts.

562
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,880
Like the one you're coming from now.

563
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,500
I love you so much.

564
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,760
Your gentle heart, your fearless writing.

565
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,970
Can you honestly say she feels the same?

566
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,320
Look, I don't know what to tell you right now.

567
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,890
Try the truth.

568
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,140
It's not too late.

569
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,970
This is worth fighting for.

570
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,390
We're worth fighting for.

571
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,310
There's no way Sage cares about you the way that I do.

572
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,560
She says that I'm a superior being,

573
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,270
and she has four limbs.

574
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,070
That is not fair.

575
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,490
Yeah, well, it is what it is.

576
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,110
That's a dumb, nothing phrase,

577
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,490
spoken by...Dumb people?

578
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,280
Dumb people? I hate it when you get nasty.

579
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,430
Well, what choice do I have, when you're rubbing my face in it?

580
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,290
Oh, what, that I'm happy for once?!

581
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm sorry!I feel sorry for you.

582
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,460
For me? For me? Look at you.

583
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,710
You won't be laughing when you realize she doesn't respect you.

584
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,340
She does respect me!

585
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,180
Wake up, Kevin. She's using you.

586
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,820
You shut the fuck up!You're throwing us away for a woman

587
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,640
who thinks you're pathetic...

588
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,810
Kevin! Kevin!

589
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,100
Come back!

590
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,270
Please, Kevin, please.

591
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,060
Please, Kevin.

592
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,650
Kevin, I-I-I can't breathe.

593
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,040
Please...What?

594
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,450
Oh, my God.Kevin!

595
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,000
Please!

596
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,140
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

597
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,230
Kevin!

598
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,520
Open the door!Fuck.

599
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,820
I love... you.

600
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,490
Okay.

601
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,780
Deep? Deep?

602
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,780
Did you get all that?Yes, sir.

603
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,160
I finally have clarity now.

604
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,450
Good.

605
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,930
I will kill whoever you want me to kill, whenever you want me to kill them.

606
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,080
I'll kill every goddamn fish in the ocean if you say so.

607
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,840
Okay.

608
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,970
Attaboy. Um...

609
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,260
Well, get to it.

610
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,070
Madam Vice President-elect?Yeah?

611
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,150
There's someone here to see you.

612
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,460
Fuck, I'm gonna miss New York bodegas.

613
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,010
Listen, we need to talk.

614
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,260
You can still stop all this, all right? Just stop.

615
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,820
You must be pretty desperate if you're throwing a Hail Mary like this. Jesus...

616
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,410
Five minutes, all right? Just five minutes

617
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,320
where we cut the bullshit and we talk, just you and me,

618
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,890
about how fucked all this is.

619
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,350
What it is, is politics. You know how it goes,

620
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,560
strange bedfellows.

621
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,750
Yeah, but it's not like you're palling around with Mitt Romney.

622
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,010
You're working with Homelander.

623
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,650
He's gonna kill the president.

624
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,860
That sounds fucking insane coming out of my mouth.

625
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,870
And when Homelander chucks all the Starlighters

626
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,350
into internment camps, you're just,

627
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,790
you're cool with that, too?

628
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,250
You didn't know about the camps.

629
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,630
Why do you think that you were at Tek-Knight's?

630
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,670
That's what his prisons are for.I got to get back to it.

631
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,090
I still have all the dirt on you. What you said at Tek-Knight's.

632
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,300
Everything.

633
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,430
Is that a threat?

634
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,770
No.

635
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,770
Because when we drop it, then you'll kill us all.

636
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,270
Like you said, mutually assured destruction.

637
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,150
But it doesn't have to be that way.

638
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,540
And if you're even, like, one percent of the person that I knew,

639
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,340
then I don't think you really want to do this.

640
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,900
You can still step back.

641
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,240
Vic, it's not too late.

642
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,750
Thanks for coming by.

643
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,130
I'm sorry...

644
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,510
...to hear about your dad.

645
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,240
Hughie's still not answering. I'm worried about him.

646
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,950
Sup, cum burgers?

647
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,740
The fuck you doing here?

648
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,700
Homelander is sick of your shit, bro.

649
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,410
Said to put you out of your misery.

650
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,540
And he sent you?

651
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,380
Sure you ain't too busy tongue lashing your octo-pussy?

652
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,840
What? No. I never...

653
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,880
He didn't just send me.

654
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Do you know what?

655
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,690
I can't believe I'm saying this,

656
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,690
but it's Christmas.

657
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,200
You two twats leg it right now,

658
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,700
and we'll forget you was ever here.

659
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,040
What, dude? I can barely understand you,

660
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,580
your accent's insane.What the fuck do you want, Deep?

661
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,540
Justice, you fucking bitch.

662
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,130
God, I'm gonna enjoy this so much.

663
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,050
First, you tried to cancel me,

664
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,480
victimize an innocent man because I guess

665
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,070
that's just cool to do to white guys nowadays.

666
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,590
But joke's on you. #MeToo's over,

667
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,390
sweetheart, it didn't work.

668
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,140
I do not respect your truth.

669
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,690
I do not honor and cherish your story.

670
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,610
And I do not fucking apologize.

671
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,160
Cunt's narcoleptic.

672
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,180
Kessler,

673
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,600
whatever you did to Ezekiel,

674
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,890
do it again.

675
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,820
What are you doing?

676
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,200
Wait, are you... You're the leak?

677
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,950
Did he just talk?

678
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,790
Bro, it was you, bro?

679
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,160
Deep, just FYI, I have always,

680
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,000
always fucking hated your ass.

681
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,880
Fuck, he can fly?

682
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,380
Eat a flying dick, motherfuck...

683
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,690
Noir will be back up here in no time, so let's go.

684
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,020
He's right fucking there. Let's do him.

685
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,150
You know how, Butcher? 'Cause I don't,

686
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,030
but Noir sure as hell's gonna know how to fucking kill us.

687
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,700
Now, come the fuck on.

688
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,370
Alexa, play "Dave Matthews Chill Mix."

689
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,210
Playing Dave Matthews...Alexa, please fucking don't.

690
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,420
What the fuck, A-Train?

691
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,340
Listen, we got to go, now.

692
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,260
Deep and Noir know that I'm the leak.

693
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,320
Wait, what?Homelander's about to find out any second.

694
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,320
Did you say anything about me, you fucking asshole?

695
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,310
No, of course not. I didn't say anything.

696
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,720
A-Train, what the fuck? What the fuck?Ashley.

697
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:29,730
This is our chance. This is our chance.

698
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,190
Florence, anywhere,

699
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,770
but let's go.

700
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,200
I can't.

701
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,830
Suit yourself.Wait, wait.

702
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,090
Your chip.

703
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,000
Don't forget to cut it out.

704
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,920
Hi, sorry, you're Starlight, right?

705
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,250
Oh, um...Can I just get a selfie?

706
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,860
Oh, that's a good one.

707
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,340
Okay. Thank you.Thanks.

708
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,970
So what's it gonna be, M?

709
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,970
You gonna help us stop an assassination, a violent insurrection?

710
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,470
Or you off to have a wank?

711
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,240
Looks like a wank then.

712
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,410
Who's Kessler?

713
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,040
Kessler?In the Flatiron.

714
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,620
You shouted a name, "Kessler,"

715
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,290
and something that had to do with Ezekiel.

716
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,250
What was that?

717
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,300
No idea what you're on about there, luv.Hmm.

718
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,010
You're really not coming.

719
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,480
Those rum punches are gonna have to wait, babe.

720
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,020
Janine needs you.

721
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,520
Monique, the one thing I've wanted more than anything,

722
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,650
my one prayer every night,

723
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,070
has been to be with you and Janine again.

724
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,150
To be a family.

725
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,740
But if I'm gonna protect you two the way I have to,

726
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,370
I can't.

727
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,370
I just...

728
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,290
I can't.

729
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,130
Maybe one day.

730
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,040
"Maybe"? What the hell's that supposed to mean, Marvin? Maybe?

731
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,670
I got to go, babe.Marvin, wait...

732
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,440
Homelander?

733
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,110
Homelander?

734
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,820
Are you all right?

735
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,030
A-Train?

736
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,320
I'm so...How could he do this to me?

737
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,070
I'm so sorry.

738
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,490
You know, some folks are just...

739
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,500
...well, they're born uppity.

740
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,040
Where is he?

741
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,000
He cut out his tracking chip.

742
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,920
And his family's gone, too.

743
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,380
Of course.

744
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,970
You sent Deep and Noir after Butcher?

745
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,300
We talked about this.

746
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,930
Smartest person in the world,

747
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,520
and you didn't know A-Train was the leak?

748
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,680
I knew.

749
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,980
You knew.

750
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,360
And you let us kill Webweaver for nothing?

751
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,990
Oh, shit.

752
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,070
You killed Webweaver?

753
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,280
Did you think he was the leak?

754
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,620
He was a junkie who'd confess to nailing Christ on the cross

755
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,790
if it got him home for his next fix.

756
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,750
I was very clear.

757
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,040
No more secrets.

758
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,630
But A-Train only leaked

759
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,380
exactly the information I wanted Butcher and his team to know.

760
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,260
He was the perfect misinformation delivery system.Until now.

761
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,850
This was all part of the plan.

762
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,810
Okay.

763
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,980
Get the fuck out of here. You're done.

764
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,440
Go back to your little litter box in Detroit

765
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,320
and die alone.

766
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,230
You promised.

767
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,070
You promised me you would listen to me.

768
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,860
You're lucky I'm not sending you home in a bucket.

769
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,080
Go.

770
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,660
Fine, surround yourself with people like her.

771
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,960
Then you can systematically eliminate anyone who gets in your way,

772
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,710
but there's one person you will never, ever defeat.

773
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,590
Good luck without me.

774
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,770
We don't need her.

775
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,900
Just-just get out.

776
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,270
Are you sure there's...

777
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,700
...nothing I can...do for you?

778
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,200
No.

779
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,700
Oh, just get the fuck out.Okay. Mm-hmm.

780
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,540
Bro?

781
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,170
Bro!

782
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,380
Bro?

783
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,470
Bro.

784
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,010
Bro.

785
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:59,580
Bro.

786
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,440
Hey, you.

787
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,480
Hey, so we've had a day.

788
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,770
Wait, what's the rush?

789
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,320
Homelander. He fired me.

790
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,360
Wait, but you can't leave. I love you.

791
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,910
We have something special, don't we?Wait.

792
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,410
Is she lobotomizing herself to fuck you, too?

793
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,330
What do you mean, "lobotomizing herself"?

794
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,540
Bro.

795
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,420
You were right. It's ready.

796
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,180
The glycerol gradient.

797
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,760
Uh, it worked.Even in a shitty lab.

798
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,810
After we do an FFA test,

799
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,820
see that the virus is working,

800
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,690
we have some good news for you, mon ami.

801
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,110
No!

802
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,240
Kimiko.

803
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,570
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

804
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,170
Okay.

805
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,050
It's okay.

806
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,390
Okay.

807
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,810
Mon coeur, look at me.

808
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,400
Take this. Focus on this.

809
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,280
I'm sorry!

810
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,220
It's okay.

811
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,390
You're okay.

812
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,060
Yeah. You're okay.

813
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,530
You didn't twig to what Sameer was up to?

814
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,360
Well, with bindings so thick, he must have worked them for days.

815
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,260
Maybe weeks. No?All right. All right.

816
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,410
What matters is if Sameer can get the bug out of a sheep's head,

817
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,620
Frenchie can get it out of Kimiko's gam.

818
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,590
All right, so, we know the virus works,

819
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,600
but is it strong enough?To kill Homelander?

820
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,550
No. But to kill Neuman at least?

821
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,970
C'est possible.

822
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,510
We've been on this for weeks, and all we have is a maybe?

823
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,180
Yo...

824
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,980
Why all the grim faces?

825
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,560
We've done more with less.

826
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,900
Ain't nobody gonna murk the president, not on our fuckin' watch.

827
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:01,700
Frenchie, that virus...it ain't gonna cook itself, brother.

828
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,530
All right, let's go.

829
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,160
Chop, chop, motherfuckers.

830
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,460
Ryan, it's Dad.

831
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,130
Hey, listen, buddy, I-I'm sorry I've been so busy lately,

832
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:19,380
but I hear you're having some issues with the-the puppet show thing.

833
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,840
Um, look, I got a lot going on here, buddy, so, uh, do me a favor.

834
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:25,180
Just-just suck it up and-and do it.

835
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,430
All right? For me. Terrific. Love you. Great. Bye.

836
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,020
There he is.

837
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,320
Where the fuck were you when I needed you?

838
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,240
Silent treatment goes both ways.

839
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,000
Stop. Stop. Just stop.

840
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:43,170
This song isn't cool.

841
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,550
Honestly, none of this is cool.

842
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,890
Go to fucking commercial!

843
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:49,060
No. Don't go to commercial.

844
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,770
Keep rolling, please.

845
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,740
Your family isn't your enemy.

846
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,200
Your family is all you've got.

847
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,870
I've been thinking about my mom a lot lately.

848
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,920
She died.

849
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,920
But she loved Christmas.

850
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,010
And s'mores with Reese's.

851
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:29,720
And Terms of Endearment.

852
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,390
And she loved her husband Billy.

853
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,480
But she wouldn't love this.

854
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,270
She wouldn't want me doing it.

855
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,730
My mom always told me to tell the truth...

856
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,700
...which is why...

857
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,540
I'm sorry.

858
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,500
And that...

859
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,040
...is why I got faith in the kid,

860
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,590
you little fucking beauty.

861
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,890
Wanker.

862
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,820
Call 911!

863
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,420
Hey, Annie?

864
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,550
I, uh... I didn't actually go to urgent care today.

865
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,050
Yeah, I could tell.

866
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,430
Yeah. Well, I... I went to go see Vicky.

867
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:58,480
Hughie!Yeah, look, I know it...

868
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,190
I'm okay. It's just...

869
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:04,480
I don't know. I thought maybe I could talk her out of it, or...

870
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,030
And...?

871
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,740
what made you...

872
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:17,910
I-I... just thought I would... try it on.

873
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,710
Okay. How-How's it... feel?

874
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,460
Feels annoying...

875
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,050
that you were right.

876
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:31,630
We'll take it... step by step,

877
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,760
one dumpster fire at a time.

878
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,640
So, you're saying, I give genius advice.

879
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,850
Don't push it.

880
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,650
Now...

881
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,780
admit it.

882
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:51,030
You have fantasized

883
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,490
about... keeping this suit on for this.

884
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,080
I haven't...not fantasized about it.
