1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,750
把我弄爽点 老兄
Oh, you got to really get it up in there, dawg.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,050
前情提要

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,340
有些罪孽应该受到永恒的诅咒
Some sins deserve eternal damnation.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,140
我犯下了谋杀罪
I've committed murders.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,720
囚犯拒绝探视
Inmate refused visitation.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,810
不!
No!

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,190
是惊恐发作 不管你在做什么 停下来
A panic attack. Whatever you're doing, stop it.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,070
他们杀了卡梅隆科尔曼
They killed Cameron Coleman because

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,210
因为他们认为他是泄密者 我受够了
they thought that he was the fucking leak. I'm done.

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,900
卡梅隆科尔曼并不是泄密者
Cameron Coleman wasn't the leak.

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,690
所以 要么智者在骗你
So, either Sage was lying to you,

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,650
要么她就像老鼠的乳头一样毫无用处
or she's as useless as tits on a mouse.

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,280
我愿意为您做任何事
I'd do anything for you.

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,240
我的乖男孩
That's my boy.

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,030
我恨你
I hate you.

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,580
喜美子
Kimiko!

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,930
维多利亚是这个计划中 不可或缺的一部分
Victoria here, she's an integral part of the plan.

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,750
我们将在选举被获准后处理辛格尔
We'll handle Singer after the election's certified.

19
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,130
第二十五项法案被实施时 你需要合理的推诿
We need plausible deniability when the 25th is invoked.

20
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,250
你说的可是一场政变啊
You're talking about a coup.

21
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,800
列出一份清单 告诉我们提取病毒都需要什么
You give us a list of what you need to extract the virus, and make it

22
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,980
提高病毒的强度 足以杀掉祖国人才行
strong enough to top Homelander.

23
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,340
我们说的不是杀死祖国人而已
We're not just talking about killing Homelander,

24
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,850
而是杀掉地球上的每一个超人类
we're talking about killing every Supe on Earth.

25
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,140
没人说过要搞种族灭绝
No one ever said nothing about genocide.

26
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,930
这他妈的是什么意思 你就是我?
What the fuck's that supposed to mean, "you're me"?

27
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,810
注射过五号之后 你的大脑里 长出了一个大大的肿瘤 你个混蛋
You got a big old fat V'd-up brain tumor, you cunt,

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,320
所以你才看得到我!
which is why you are seeing me in the first place.

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,030
我就是你
I am you.

30
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:18,070
沃特工作室呈现

31
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,950
《纽约市五号大道》圣诞特辑

32
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,920
圣诞快乐 火车头!
Well, Merry Christmas, A-Train!

33
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,840
圣诞快乐 莱恩
Oh, Merry Christmas, Ryan.

34
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,140
为什么不开心?
Why the long face?

35
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,180
反法西斯行动
Antifa.

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,600
那是什么?
What's that?

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,770
莱恩 这个词形容
Well, Ryan, it's a word for people

38
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,900
讨厌超级英雄和美国
who hate superheroes and America

39
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,360
甚于讨厌圣诞节的人
even more than they hate Christmas.

40
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,600
他们长什么样?
Well, what do they look like?

41
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,280
那就是问题所在 他们可能是任何人
That's the problem. They can look like anyone,

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,410
你的邻居 你的老师 甚至你的爸妈
your neighbors, your teachers, even your mom and dad.

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,370
发现可疑情况就举报

44
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,830
有人想要操控你 举报他

45
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,040
发现可疑情况就举报

46
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,880
因为他也讨厌美国和圣诞节

47
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,920
可能是左翼的校长和他丈夫查德

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,630
也可能是你说超人类坏话的叔叔

49
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,030
甚至可能是你的爸妈 但请听听黄金法则

50
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,600
汤米 可以暂停一下吗?暂停排练
Uh, Tommy, can we cut out for a second?Uh, that's a cut on rehearsal.

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,870
停好
That's a cut.

52
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,270
各位 休息20分钟
Back in 20, everyone.

53
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,890
没什么事吧?
Hey, is everything okay?

54
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,020
让孩子们去举报自己的父母 这也
I mean, yeah, it's just...

55
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,150
你爸已经批准这些歌词了
we're telling kids to report on their own parents.

56
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,730
亲自批准的 所以
The lyrics were approved by your dad. Personally, so...

57
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,860
对哦 是哈 对
Right. Right, yeah, yeah.

58
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,700
对 没问题
Right.Yeah. It's no problem.

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,330
我得去趟洗手间
I just need to go 10-1.

60
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,620
好
Yeah.

61
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,670
英雄克星

62
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,090
公关部向犹太教会道歉了
PR made that apology to Temple Beth El,

63
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,570
所以这事已经板上钉钉了
so that should be a done fucking deal.

64
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,760
其次 我们有个很好的
Um, secondly, we've got a...

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,470
不是11点开会吗?
I thought the meeting started at 11:00.

66
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,760
我们提前开了
We moved it up.

67
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,930
下一项
Um, next.

68
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,690
营销部想开始出售你的非同质化代币
Oh, marketing would like to start selling these NFTs of you.

69
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,360
显然 买家不只是购买图片文件 还会加入虚拟社区
Apparently, you're not just buying JPEGs, you're joining a community.

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,610
艾诗丽是 先生
Ashley.Yes, sir?

71
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,940
出去是 先生
Get out.Yes, sir.

72
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,950
对不起 先生 是 没问题
Sorry, sir. Yes, absolutely.

73
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,710
智者
Sage...

74
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,960
泄密者是谁?
who's the leak?

75
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,460
我们正在调查
We're making inquiries.

76
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,090
需要花点时间 我们需要
It's a process, we're eliminating...

77
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,490
我想你很清楚这是什么
I assume you know what that is.

78
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,300
是监听器 威廉布彻尔布下的监听器
It's a bug.Specifically William Butcher's bug.

79
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,850
我们在泰克骑士庄园说的每一个字 他们可能都听到了
They probably heard every single word we said at Tek-Knight's.

80
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,310
很可能还杀了他
And likely killed him.

81
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,350
他们不会公开这些信息
They won't go public with the information.

82
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,270
为什么呢?因为会妨碍
And why not?Because it would short-circuit

83
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,440
他们得到自己想要的东西
everything they really want,

84
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,270
他们想一劳永逸地 神不知鬼不觉地除掉纽曼
which is to quietly take out Neuman once and for all.

85
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,190
我们应该把布彻尔及其整个团队 都杀个片甲不留
We should slaughter Butcher and his whole fucking team.

86
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,490
真是个好主意 先生
Now that is a great idea, sir.

87
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,820
反正布彻尔也活不了几个月了
Butcher will be dead in a few months anyway.

88
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,660
就要实行大计划了 我可不想引起中情局的注意
And this close to go-time, I wouldn't stir up shit with the CIA.

89
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,410
是的!你那该死的杰出计划
Yes, yes, yes. Your illustrious fucking plan.

90
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,000
我们无缘无故地杀了卡梅隆科尔曼
We killed Cameron Coleman for no reason.

91
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,420
暂时的困难 但无碍于计划
A speed bump but, ultimately, harmless.

92
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,250
卡梅隆和迈克林德尔一起打高尔夫球
Cameron golfed with Mike Lindell,

93
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,050
后者撤走了 价值五千万美元的枕头广告投资
who just pulled 50 million bucks worth of pillow commercials.

94
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,170
那叫无碍吗?
You call that harmless?

95
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,340
看看是谁在赶鸭子上架做算数呢
Oh, look at Daisy Duck Dynasty doing math.

96
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,680
我和鞭炮讨论来着
You know, Firecracker and I have been talking.

97
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,850
肯定相当刺激
Stimulating, I'm sure.

98
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,980
对不起
Sorry.

99
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,690
你有头脑 智者
You have brains, Sage,

100
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,810
但我有智慧
but I have wisdom.

101
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,480
如果你的大脑再次受伤
And what happens if those brains of yours

102
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,110
让你像个胡言乱语的白痴
get blown out again, leaving you

103
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,610
那该怎么办?
talking like a gibbering idiot?

104
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,160
我和鞭炮会找出泄密者
Firecracker and I will find the leak.

105
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,300
恕我直言 上次
With respect, the last time...

106
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,120
宽恕你?我没感觉你在寻求宽恕
Respect? I don't hear no fucking respect.

107
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,040
事实上 你对这位伟大人物这么讲话
In fact, I am personally offended

108
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,540
令我个人感到极受冒犯
by the way you are talking to this great man.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,130
你专心管好枪手就行了
You just focus on the shooter,

110
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,630
确保他六号那天准备就绪
make sure he's good to go on the sixth.

111
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,390
他会准备好的
He'll be ready.

112
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,180
好的
Good.

113
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,010
你可以离开了
You may leave.

114
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,680
《静水深流》深海的诗

115
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,730
这首叫《世界是我们的牡蛎》
This one's called The World's Our Oyster.

116
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,150
闪闪发光的海带森林
"Shimmering forests of kelp

117
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,820
就像大自然的洗车刷
Like nature's car wash brushes

118
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,070
在黑暗的海底 水母发光
At the dark bottom, jellyfish glow

119
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,860
就像兄弟会的熔岩灯
Like frat house lava lamps

120
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,030
我可以带你游去任何地方
I can swim you anywhere

121
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,910
七大洋 水路长长
The seven seas, one big wet road."

122
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,990
天哪 凯文
Jesus, Kevin.

123
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,210
你确实有着诗人的灵魂
You really have the soul of a poet.

124
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,790
好啦
Stop.

125
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,170
你真坏
You're so bad.

126
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,960
天哪 你的舌头
And, God, your tongue

127
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,880
就像舷外发动机 是吗?
is like an outboard motor.Yeah?

128
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,090
我高潮了好多次
I came so many times.

129
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,010
真的吗?
Really?

130
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,230
今天不顺 刺我的大脑 然后从后面干我?

131
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,520
我 我得走了 宝贝
I, uh, I got to go, babe.

132
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,820
什么?这就走?
What? You do?

133
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,320
职责在身
Duty calls.

134
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,910
等等 不 等等!
Wait. No, no. Wait.

135
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,660
拜托 宝贝 你知道 自己不能长时间离开水
Come on, babe. You know you can't be out of water for long.

136
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,410
不 你答应过我 会把我放进床上方的水族箱
No, you promised me you'd move me into the tank above the bed.

137
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,000
没错 当然可以 宝贝 一定会的
Right, no. Of course, babe. A hunny percent.

138
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,000
只不过 我得先清除淡水外来物种
I just got to, uh, you know, clear out the freshwater exotics first,

139
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,670
然后就一切就绪
and then it'll be all set.

140
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,210
对了 我要跟希安开电话会议
Oh, and I got a notes call with Shia

141
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,970
给他的新作《蜜糖男孩二》改剧本 肯定很精彩
on his new draft of Honey Boy 2. It's really starting to sing.

142
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,640
那我明天可以搬进去吗?
Well, can I move in tomorrow?

143
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,430
完全可以
Yeah, totally.

144
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,720
你这么一说 我就得收拾东西离开?
Just like that, I'm supposed to pick up and leave?

145
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,180
在沙漠里过圣诞节 太棒了
Christmas in the desert. Terrific.

146
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,650
跟詹待在塞多纳你会更安全 好吗?
You're safer with Gen in Sedona, okay?

147
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,610
可能 很快就有大事发生
Some... things might happen soon.What do you mean?

148
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,070
什么意思?什么事?
What... what kind of things?

149
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,190
你还是不知道的好
It's better you don't know.

150
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,400
你突然打给我 几个星期以来
You call me out of the blue...I have called you

151
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,870
我每天都给你打电话!今天你才接
every day for weeks. This is the first time you've picked up.

152
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,700
他们不让我参加周二的圣经小组了
You know, they kicked me out of the Tuesday Bible group.

153
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,310
与我无关 是吗?
That has nothing to do with me.No?

154
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,250
我听见雪莉低声说“唐娜怎么会养出那种女儿?”
Well, I heard Shelly whisper, "How the heck did Donna raise that girl?"

155
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,750
你明天一早出发就好
Okay, just hit the road first thing tomorrow...

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,380
“她怎么做得出堕胎这种事?”
"That she would have an abortion?"

157
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,260
你应该达到更高的标准
You're supposed to be held to a higher standard.

158
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,850
我是按高标准养育你的
That's how I raised you.

159
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,850
全世界的女孩以你为榜样
Girls all over the world look up to you.

160
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,830
现在她们认为自己可以为所欲为了 因为没有任何后果
And now they think they can be loose, because there's no consequences...

161
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,430
那不关你的事
That is none of your business,

162
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,440
肯定也他妈的不关雪莉的事!
and it sure as fuck isn't Shelly's.

163
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,360
你是星光 你是位超级英雄
You're Starlight. You're a superhero.

164
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,690
我是个人
I'm a person.

165
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,400
现在 星光之类的屁事已经不重要了
Right now, none of that Starlight shit matters.

166
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,280
那休伊为什么留着你的战衣?
Then why did Hughie save the suit?

167
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,910
我非常 非常抱歉
I am so, so sorry.

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,040
真他妈糟透了
That is so fucked.

169
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,180
我从垃圾桶里捡回来的
I pulled it from the trash.

170
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,230
以为某天你可能会后悔扔掉它
I mean, I thought you might regret tossing it someday.

171
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,630
我连看都不想看
I don't even like looking at it.

172
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,260
好的 好吧
Okay. All right.

173
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,630
好了 我 这就扔掉
Done. I am... There it goes.

174
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,550
它
It is...

175
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,260
滚蛋了
out of here.

176
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,560
我只是
I just...

177
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,020
天哪 我只是 不想
God. I just, I didn't...

178
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,610
让宝宝降生到一个面临末日的世界
want to bring a baby into a world that's ending.

179
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,990
休伊 这种事
Hughie. It's just...

180
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,200
这种事令人难以承受
...it's just all too much.

181
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,330
到处都一片混乱 情况失控
I mean, there are so many fucking dumpster fires.

182
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,340
我们要从哪里入手呢?
Where do we even start?

183
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,380
一步一步来吧
We just take it step by step.

184
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,840
你一直在喝酒
You smell like you've been drinking.

185
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,450
我不知道你想怎样
I don't know what you want from me, all right?

186
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,450
我马上就赶来了 我希望你干好这一票
I got here as fast as I could...I want you to do your fucking job.

187
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,770
无所谓了
Whatever.

188
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,750
你真的认为他就是枪手?
You really think this could be our Lee Harvey?

189
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,900
火车头说是他 要我说 我们也去会会他
That's what A-Train says. I say we visit him, too.

190
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,970
你他妈的去哪了?
Where the fuck you been?

191
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,660
蹲厕所里拉屎啊
Shittin' a kidney.

192
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,540
好吧 听着
All right, listen up.

193
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,080
别不开心 但是
Now, don't get your knickers in a twist, but...

194
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,960
你们还记得纽曼的心上人吧
...you remember Neuman's dearly departed

195
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,970
造病毒的那小子? 萨米尔沙阿博士?
virus bloke? Dr. Sameer Shah?

196
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,930
我是认真的 布彻尔 别
I'm serious, Butcher. Don't.

197
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,550
有意思的是
Well, funny story.

198
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,310
原来他还没死
Turns out he ain't that dead.

199
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,060
他一直在为我工作 制造更多的病毒
He's been working for me, making some more of that virus.

200
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,310
搞什么?
What the fuck?

201
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,060
等等 他们只发现了
Wait, all they found was...

202
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,270
天哪 你个混蛋 你砍断了他的腿?
Goddamn it, you asshole.Did you cut off his leg?

203
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,090
冷静点 你把人家截了肢
All right, all right, keep your hair on.So, basically,

204
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,740
让他研究秘密生物武器
you've been amputatin' motherfuckers while working on a secret bioweapon,

205
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,510
却要我们冷静?
and we're the ones that are supposed to chill?

206
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,030
你会毁了我们最好的机会
You are pissing away our best shot.

207
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,880
问题是 我们遇到了一个小障碍
Now, the trouble is, we've hit a slight snag.

208
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,370
如果病毒能干掉祖国人
He can't make it deadly enough to top Homelander

209
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,830
就会造成全球性的大瘟疫
without causing a, you know,global pandemic.

210
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,000
天哪
Jesus.

211
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,090
等等
Wait.

212
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,210
种族灭绝
Genocide.

213
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,760
你说的是超人类的种族灭绝
You're talking about Supe genocide. That's...

214
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,180
布彻尔 即使对你这种人来说 这也
Yeah, Butcher, even for you...

215
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,550
所以我才告诉你们 不是吗?
Which is why I'm fucking telling you, innit?

216
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
你以为我想让双手沾满鲜血吗?
You think I want that much blood on me hands?

217
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,930
你想 你他妈的想在血海里游泳
Yeah, you do. You want to fucking swim in it.

218
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,060
不 我不想!
No, I don't.

219
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,060
不 我不想
No, I do not.

220
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,110
因此 为了防止病毒 像野火燎原一样灭了你们超人类
So, to keep the bug from burning through you lot like wildfire,

221
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,190
我觉得萨米尔需要一点帮助
I thought ol' Sameer could do with

222
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,450
谁的帮助?
a bit of a hand.From who?

223
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,330
真是极富有洞察力 与话题密切相关的问题 小子
A question both insightful and germane, my son.

224
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,910
他来了 说曹操 曹操就到
Ah, here he is. Speak of the devil.

225
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,340
早上好
Bonjour.

226
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,850
你他妈的是怎么出狱的?
How the fuck did you get out?

227
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
我让马洛里找了几个熟人
I had Mallory pull a few strings.

228
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,030
得说清楚
Just to be clear,

229
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,180
这是违背我意愿的
this was against my will.

230
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,140
我宁愿操一罐鱼饵 也不想出狱
I'd rather fuck a jar of fishing lures than to be free.

231
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,350
真不赖
Oh, cool. Cool.

232
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,470
好吧
All right, then.

233
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,850
重聚愉快
Happy reunions. So,

234
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,770
法兰奇会帮忙拣选病毒
Frenchie will help sort the virus.

235
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,030
只给祖国人和副总统注射病毒 其他人不会受影响
We'll use it on Homelander and the VP and that's it, no one else.

236
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,530
你个该死的胆小鬼
You fucking coward.

237
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,870
好的 这样可行
Okay, that works.

238
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,080
喜美子 法兰奇 你们俩去帮沙阿博士
Kimiko, Frenchie, you two are on Dr. Shah.

239
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,960
剩下的人去查那个神秘枪手
The rest of you, on the mystery man.

240
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,400
别·做·混蛋

241
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,490
“别做个混蛋”
"Don't be a cunt."

242
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,850
听着 你应该 去
Listen...You should... go on ahead.

243
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,970
那你呢?
You what?

244
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,600
我不去 我得和莫妮克谈谈 是
Without me. I gotta talk to Monique. It's...

245
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,060
得了吧
Oh, come off it.

246
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,730
别让我独自面对这堆混球
Don't leave me alone with this lot.

247
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,150
等等 怎么了?
Wait, what?

248
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,960
他不参与行动了不参与?为什么?
He ain't going.You're not going? Why?

249
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,780
我们要正式宣布?
All right, so we gonna make this official?

250
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,780
跪下 我会用鸡巴封你为骑士
Take a knee,I'll knight you with my dick.

251
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,030
你回来领导英雄克星 好吗?
You're back in charge of The Boys again, all right?

252
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,240
反正我还是做研究比较好
I'm better off doing research anyway.

253
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,450
不 你不能这样做
No, you can't do this.

254
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,870
你不必这样做
You don't got to do this.

255
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,000
他得这样做 这对我们有好处
Yeah, he does. This is good for us.

256
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,790
不行 这个混蛋不回来
You can't. Things are bad already

257
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,230
情况就已经很糟糕了
without this fucking asshole back.

258
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,090
这情况真难搞
Look what I got to deal with.

259
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,610
听着 这事无可争议 伙计们
Listen, it ain't a debate, you guys.

260
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,510
我晕过去了
I passed out.

261
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,220
在执行任务期间
During a mission.

262
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,470
我不适合当头儿
I ain't cut out to be skipper.

263
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,640
他才适合
But he is.

264
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,850
所以让他来当 你来当
So, it's him. It's you.

265
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,060
就这么办
End of story.

266
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,490

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,240
一万美元现金
That's $10,000 cash.

270
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,140
从我的账户转入你的名下
The rest of my accounts, I transferred into yours.

271
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,290
马文
Marvin...

272
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,560
这是两张去伯利兹的单程票
Here's two one-way tickets to Belize.

273
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,890
今晚你和珍妮的航班
You and Janine's flights are tonight.

274
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,120
只是待上一阵子
Now, it's not forever,

275
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,290
等情况平稳了就回来 停
just until things blow over.Stop.

276
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,130
停下来
Just stop.

277
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,510
好吗?告诉我这是怎么回事
Okay? Tell me what's wrong.

278
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,340
就要发生大事了
Something big's about to go down.

279
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,890
如果我们输了 世界就会一团糟
If we lose, shit's gonna get crazy.

280
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,850
如果我们赢了 世界就更会是一团糟
If we win, shit's gonna get even crazier,

281
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,350
所以 无论如何 你们都得走
so either way, y'all got to go.

282
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,180
再次让你们收拾东西离开 我很抱歉
And I'm sorry to make you have to pick up and leave again,

283
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,390
但我他妈的得完成任务
but I got one fucking job to do,

284
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,400
这是为了保证你和珍妮的安全
and that's to keep you and Janine safe,

285
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,690
我会良心受遣 如果我任由
and I'll be damned if I let any of this fucking sh...

286
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,290
我知道你很努力 马文
I know how hard you try, Marvin,

287
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,160
照顾我和珍妮
taking care of Janine and me.

288
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,170
跟我们走吧
Come with us.

289
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,920
我相信你
I believe you.

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,090
如果你做了这些事 我
If you did all this, I...

291
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,800
我确信情况比我想像的还糟
...I'm sure it's even worse than I'm imagining.

292
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,640
所以 我们走吧
So let's go.

293
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,260
我们三个人 我们一家一起走
The three of us, let's go be a family.

294
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,690
莫妮克
Monique...

295
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,190
你知道我最在乎你和珍妮
you know that you and Janine are my heart,

296
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,560
对吧?
right?

297
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,980
可我不能走 看看你
I can't.Look at you.

298
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,070
那次恐慌发作本该是个警告 马文
That panic attack was supposed to be a warning, Marvin.

299
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,150
在机场跟我们会合
Meet us at the airport...

300
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,410
明天这个时候
...and this time tomorrow,

301
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,160
宝贝 我们就已经在海滩上喝着朗姆潘趣酒
baby, we'll be sipping rum punches

302
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,410
看珍妮躲避海浪了
on the beach while Janine dodges the waves.

303
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,720
纪念卡梅隆科尔曼 珍妮麦卡锡说:“又一位烈士离世”
For over a decade, one man has been a voice you can trust.

304
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,760
十多年来 他一直都是您可以信赖的声音

305
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,640
现在 那个声音消逝了
And now that voice is gone.

306
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,220
卡梅隆科尔曼因流感疫苗直接引起的
Cameron Coleman has died of a brain aneurism

307
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,640
脑动脉瘤去世
as a direct result of the flu vaccine.

308
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,350
斯人已逝 永远铭记
Gone from this world, but never gone from our hearts.

309
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,000
再次报道
Once again, tragedy...

310
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,570
你的助理呢?格雷戈里?我解雇了他
Hey. What happened to your assistant?Oh, Gregory? I fired him.

311
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,380
总把我的沙拉订单搞错
Dumb fuck could never get my Sweetgreen order right.

312
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
你想干什么?
What do you want?

313
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,360
听着 他们知道 卡梅隆不是泄密者了
Listen. They know Cameron's not the leak...

314
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,490
闭嘴 我不想再听那些屁事了
Shut the fuck up. I don't want to hear that shit anymore.

315
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,700
你他妈的少扯上我 我不干了
You leave me the fuck out of that. I'm done.

316
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,870
你喝醉了?
You're shitfaced?

317
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,080
我仍然是这家公司的首席执行官
I am still the CEO of this company,

318
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,800
如果首席执行官想在上午11点 喝个烂醉如泥 谁也管不了
and if the CEO wants to get shitfaced at 11:00 a.m., I can.

319
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,590
他是最好的
He was the best.

320
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,380
他是我最好的助手
He was the fucking best assistant I ever fucking had.

321
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,180
我解雇他 是为了让他离开这个该死的地方
And I fired him to get him away from this fucking place.

322
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,270
我害卡梅隆被杀 是我陷害了他
I had Cameron killed. I had him killed.

323
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,810
你救了我的命
Look, you saved my life.

324
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,310
我本来可以用其他方式救你
I could've done that some other way.

325
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,400
他不必死的
He didn't have to die.

326
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,480
在这里 很容易就会变成禽兽
It's-it's so easy to become a monster around here.

327
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,070
我们当初离开会怎样呢?
What if we left? Huh?

328
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,370
我们当初离开会怎样呢?
What if we left?

329
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,080
你和我?
You and me?

330
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,710
我不是说发生性关系 真恶心 不是的
I don't mean us fucking... ew, no.

331
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,330
我在佛罗伦萨上的大三 我们可以一走了之!
I spent my junior year abroad in Florence, we could just go, we could go.

332
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,790
你有护照 好了
You have a passport.All right.

333
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,560
你不需要护照 艾诗丽
Oh, you don't need a passport. You just run...Hey, Ashley. Ashley.

334
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,840
你振作一点
Get your shit together.

335
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,050
好吗?你不能烂醉如泥 口不择言
Okay? You cannot be all wasted running your fucking mouth,

336
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,600
会害死我们俩的
not when you have both of our lives in your fucking hands.

337
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,430
管好你的嘴
Button it up.

338
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,680
现在
Now.

339
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,960
好了 我去后面看看
All right. I'll have a dekko around the back,

340
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,290
你们俩去看看前面 好吗?
you two take the front, yeah?

341
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,250
然后我们去找那个枪手
And then we'll pay the shooter a visit.

342
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,560
我绞尽脑汁
You know, I have been racking my brain...

343
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,230
想弄清楚你是什么时候 开始对超人类心软的
trying to figure out when you got this soft spot for Supes.

344
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,610
是你跟梅芙翻云覆雨的时候吗?
Was it when you shot your load and cream-pied Maeve?

345
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,700
好吧 知道吗?
All right, you know what?

346
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,040
受够你对我的沉默对待了 你个顽固不化的混蛋
Enough with the silent treatment, you stubborn prick,

347
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,500
我们各走各路
I am done fucking around with you.

348
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,500
我知道你不在乎星光或喜美子
See, I know you don't care about Starlight or Kimiko.

349
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,250
并不真的在乎 莱恩呢?
Not really. And Ryan?

350
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,380
他甚至都不是你的种
He's not even yours.

351
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,300
所以 告诉我
So, tell me...

352
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,140
为什么对这孩子这么有信心?
what justifies the faith in the kid?

353
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,060
我跟她保证过
I gave her my word.

354
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,600
贝嘉?真的吗?
Becca? Really?

355
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,560
如果你的爱如此完美纯洁
If your love was so perfect and pure...

356
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,940
为什么还操那个女服务员?
...then why'd you fuck that waitress?

357
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,820
我搞砸了 好吗?
I fucked up, all right.

358
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,330
我第二天就戒了酒 不是吗?
And I quit the booze the next day, didn't I?

359
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,790
是的
Yeah.

360
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,910
不禁注意到你最近又开戒了
I can't help but notice you've been quitting the quitting lately.

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,880
你一直说 做这一切都是为了纪念贝嘉
You know, you keep saying that you're doing all this to honor Becca's memory.

362
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,380
她活着的时候 你没对她这么上心呀
You never did that when she was alive.

363
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,630
所以 你不觉得应该停止扯谎了吗?
So, don't you think it's time to cut the shit?

364
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,840
滚蛋吧 贱人
Fuck off, cunt.

365
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,120
没什么问题
All clear.

366
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,170
不过 厕所里有用过的卫生棉条
Except for literal used tampons in the toilet.

367
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,570
美国特勤局

368
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,130
伙计们 特勤局的文件
Guys... Secret Service files.

369
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,970
1月6日的任务详情 什么?
Detail assignments for January 6th.What?

370
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,030
华盛顿露天市场的地图 辛格尔要在那里举行集会
It's a map of the D.C. Fairgrounds where Singer's having his rally.

371
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,740
他们要在那里刺杀总统
That's where they're giving him the old Dealey Plaza.

372
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,900
受保护者：当选总统罗伯特辛格尔
M说得没错
M was right.

373
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,890
我的天哪!
Oh, my God.

374
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,270
谢天谢地 你们来了
Oh, thank God you're here.

375
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,390
他杀了我丈夫
He killed my husband.

376
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,190
他关了我好几天了
He held me for days.

377
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,440
等等
Wait.

378
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,230

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,950
是的 我是 你好
Yeah. Yeah, hi.

380
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,950
天哪 你身上好烫 你没事吧?
Oh, my God. You are... burning up. Are you okay?

381
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,370
里面热得像个熔炉好
It's like a furnace in there.

382
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,870
我们找人帮你 好吗?
Okay. Let's get you some help. Yeah?

383
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,330
来吧
Come on.

384
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,170
他妈的!该死
Fuck! Stop!

385
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,210
她划伤了我
Oi!

386
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,570
谢谢

387
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,280
什么东西?好恶心
What the fuck?So gross. Ugh!

388
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,070
妈的!看到像她的人了吗?没有
Fuck!Do you see anything?No.

389
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,200
该死的变形超人类
Fucking Supe shapeshifters.

390
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,280
恨死那些贱人了
I hate those cunts.

391
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,660
不过不得不称赞智者
Got to hand it to Sage though...

392
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,290
刺杀任务的完美人选
perfect choice for the job.

393
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,850
等等 所以 枪手变成什么样子都有可能?
Wait, wait, wait. So we're saying that they could be anyone?

394
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,880
如果是这样
How the fuck are we supposed to save the president

395
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,250
我们怎么救总统?
if the killer could be anyone?

396
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,130
不慌不忙地救
By not shitting our panties.

397
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,510
休伊 等一下
Hughie, wait a minute.

398
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,090
天哪 你得去缝针

你多大 87岁吗?
Damn, what are you, 87?

405
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,330
你他妈的来这儿干什么?
The fuck are you doing here?

406
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,930
我正要问你呢
You took the words right out of my mouth.

407
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,200
我之前去了枪手那里
See, I ran by that shithole earlier.

408
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,710
我看到了布彻尔 休伊 星光
I saw Butcher, Hughie and Starlight going in.

409
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,920
但某个混蛋却没现身
But one motherfucker was conspicuously absent.

410
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,300
所以 你要一走了之?
So... this is it?

411
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,890
你以为我不想去伯利兹享清福
You think I don't want to just peace out to Belize,

412
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,890
喝杯代基里酒 找当地美女上床?
sip a daiquiri, smash the local talent?

413
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,640
那就去买打折机票吧 混蛋嘿!
Get on Priceline then, motherfucker.

414
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,980
这事还没完
Hey. This shit ain't over.

415
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,560
对我来说结束了
It's over for me.

416
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,860
我付出得够多了
I've given enough.

417
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,150
也许我他妈的值得去享享清福
Maybe I deserve to be fucking happy.

418
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,690
我送你去急诊室时
You know, when I carried your ass to the ER,

419
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,400
看到一个孩子
there was a kid there.

420
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,030
他的眼神里充满敬畏
His eyes were like...

421
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,370
我的妈呀
"Holy shit."

422
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,870
看着我
Looking at me...

423
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,290
好像我是位英雄
...like I was a hero.

424
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,670
没有尖叫的粉丝 没有摄像机
There were no screaming fans, no cameras.

425
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,090
甚至没有人知道
Nobody even knew.

426
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,130
除了这个孩子
Except for this one kid.

427
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,260
那感觉比我在沃特 做过的所有事情都要美好
That felt better than anything that I'd ever done at Vought.

428
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,730
因为这一次
Because for once...

429
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,940
我没有讨厌自己
I didn't hate myself.

430
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,030
那要归功于你
That's on you.

431
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,910
火车头 你不明白 是吗 伙计?
A-Train, you don't get it, do you, man?

432
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,040
我们参与的这场战斗
This fight that we're in?

433
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,410
他妈的永远不会结束
This never fucking ends.

434
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,000
它害死了我父亲 害死了我爷爷
It killed my father. It killed his father.

435
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,500
看看它把我变成了什么样
And look at what it's doing to me.

436
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,630
让我痛苦不堪
It's tearing me the fuck apart.

437
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,220
重蹈我爸和我爷的覆辙
Just like it did them.

438
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,100
照镜子时
You know, I look in the mirror...

439
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,180
我再也认不出自己来了
and I don't even see myself no more.

440
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,560
我已经一无所有了
I got nothing left.

441
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,900
只有家人
Except my family.

442
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,820
你认为祖国人 沃特
You think Homelander and Vought...

443
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,160
还有这些烂事 不会影响到伯利兹吗?
...and all of this shit ain't coming to Belize?

444
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,790
不会影响到整个世界?
This whole fucking world?

445
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,000
那时 你的家人要去哪里?
Where's your family gonna go then?

446
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,150
谢谢
Thanks.

447
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,570
等你吃完
After you eat,

448
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,030
我们再调整离心次数
we'll adjust your centrifugation numbers.

449
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,250
我想 也许 我们应该尝试甘油梯度
I think peut-etre we should try a glycerol gradient.

450
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,790
这个“实验室”无法制造出他想要的东西
This, uh...quote-unquote "lab" can't produce what he wants.

451
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,290
是我们都想要的东西
What we all want.

452
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,920
我们都想干掉祖国人 不是吗?
Homelander... fini, do we not?

453
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,970
你在最好的实验室工作过 那里拥有最好的设备
You know, you worked in the finest lab with the best equipment,

454
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,510
可我呢?
but moi?

455
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,060
我曾在肮脏的地下室里工作过
I have worked in filthy basements with equipment

456
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,270
用的是从垃圾箱和一元店淘来的设备
from dumpsters and dollar stores.

457
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,850
必要性是促成发明的第一要素
Necessity is the MILF of invention.

458
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,020
知道嘛 他对着空气说话
You know, um, he would talk to people who weren't here.

459
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,490
你的那位朋友
Your friend.

460
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,780
或许可以听点音乐?
Some music, perhaps?

461
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:44,080
我注意到你很享受20世纪90年代 令人反感的垃圾音乐
I noticed you enjoy truly revolting garbage from the 1990s.

462
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,960
帮你工作 祝你胃口大开
Help you work.Bon appetit.

463
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,670
这种病毒
This virus.

464
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,220
只给祖国人用 对吧? 不会用在维琪身上?
It's just for Homelander, right? Not for Vicky?

465
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,140
莱恩 是爸爸
Ryan, it's Dad.

466
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,730
听着 儿子 最近太忙了 我很抱歉
Hey, listen, buddy, I-I'm sorry I've been so busy lately,

467
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,230
但我听说你不大同意拍那个
but I hear you're having some issues

468
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,900
布偶戏的节目
with the-the puppet show thing.

469
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,520
我手头上事情很多
Um, look, I got a lot going on here,

470
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,440
儿子 所以 帮我个忙 不要抱怨
buddy, so, uh, do me a favor,

471
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,780
拍就是了 好吗?为了我
just-just-just suck it up and-and do it, all right? For me.

472
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,530
太好了 爱你 很好 再见
Terrific. Love you. Great. Bye.

473
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,780
你绝对确定
Are you absolutely sure

474
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,410
他就是泄密者?
that he is the leak?

475
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,960
那小混球都招了 什么都承认了
The little shit broke wide open. He confessed to everything.

476
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,380
先生 网络喷子
Sir.Webweaver.

477
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,910
搞什么?
Ew, what the fuck?

478
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,510
对不起
Ew.I'm sorry.

479
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,810
我一紧张就这样
Happens when I'm nervous.

480
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,140
不用紧张 说吧
Oh, fuck.Ain't got to be nervous, just...

481
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,400
告诉他你跟我说过的话 我知道
go on, tell him what you told me. I know.

482
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,980
是 女士
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,480
是 先生
Yes, sir.

484
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,730
我知无不言
Whatever you want to know.

485
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,360
怎么运作的?
How does it work?

486
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,700
战衣上有个洞 网就可以喷出去
There's a hole in the suit so the webs can get out...

487
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,870
不 跟威廉布彻尔是怎么运作的?
No. No. How does it work with William Butcher?

488
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,620
这个嘛 他
Yeah, well, uh... He-he...

489
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,910
来找我
he comes to me.

490
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,660
我告诉他 他想知道的事情
I tell him what he wants to know.

491
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,520
老天爷呀
Oh, for God sakes.

492
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,210
真令人尴尬 他妈的闭嘴吧
That's just embarrassing.Just shut the fuck up.

493
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,050
布彻尔的一名下属穿着你
Now, one of Butcher's crew

494
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,090
令人作呕的战衣去了泰克骑士的庄园
was wearing your nasty-ass suit to Tek-Knight's.

495
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,600
战衣是你给他的吗?
Did you give it to them?

496
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,310
我万分羞愧
I'm not proud of it.

497
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,810
看吧
There it is.

498
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,160
帮我搞清楚一件事
Help me out with something here.

499
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,860
在那之前的几周
Few weeks back,

500
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,960
你怎么知道 我在哪里见维多利亚纽曼?
how did you know where I was meeting Victoria Neuman?

501
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,240
听着 我搞砸了 我知道
Look, I-I messed up. I know, I know...

502
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,820
对不起
I'm sorry.

503
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,370
我
I...

504
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,080
对不起
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

505
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,170
我感觉很难受
I... I don't feel very good.

506
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,830
但你见过这个英国人吧?
You ever meet this British guy?

507
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,500
他是个骗子
He's a liar.Hmm.

508
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,670
把人搞得精神崩溃
He fucks with your brain.

509
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
也许是你意志薄弱 是的
Feeble brains, maybe.Yes.

510
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,760
薄弱 我脑子进水了
Feeble. I'm all fucked up.

511
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,180
我给您制造了麻烦
I screwed you.

512
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,970
我非常 非常抱歉
I'm so, so sorry.

513
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,310
我会让您感到骄傲的 我向上帝发誓
I'll make you proud. I swear to God.

514
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,190
伙计 我拿你怎么办呢?
Oh, buddy, what am I gonna do with you?

515
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,570
天哪 别拉了
Jesus.Oh, stop.

516
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,410
等等 等等
Wait, wait!

517
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,290
什么?不是我干的
What?It wasn't me.

518
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,040
求你了!
No, please.

519
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,800
谢谢你 鞭炮
Thank you, Firecracker.

520
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,350
没问题
You bet.

521
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,150
天哪

522
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,610
圣诞快乐 一份小小心意
For Noel.It's not much.

523
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,330
我很想念你
I've missed you.

524
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,760
我每天都去 可你不肯见我
I came every day. You wouldn't see me.

525
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,100
我很惭愧
I was ashamed.

526
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,060
因为你对科林和他家人所做的一切
For what you did to Colin and his family.

527
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,690
你向安妮倾诉了很多 其余的都是我拼凑起来的
You told a lot to Annie. The rest I pieced together.

528
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,230
那你就知道我为什么要自首了
Then you know why I had to turn myself in.

529
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,700
你累了
You're exhausting.

530
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
对不起
Sorry.

531
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,830
你总是这样 喜怒无常
You always do this. All moody.

532
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,040
折磨自己
Torturing yourself.

533
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,450
不然我该怎样?
What else was I supposed to do?

534
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,000
寻求帮助 找我帮你
Ask for help. Come to me for help.

535
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,580
你无能为力 你不理解
You can't help.You don't understand.

536
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:05,380
你知道我为什么不能说话吗?
Do you know why I can't speak?

537
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,590
你看着闪光军杀了亲生父母
You watched Shining Light kill your parents.

538
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,390
你弟弟告诉我的
Your brother told me.

539
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,310
我从来没有告诉健二真相
I never told Kenji the truth.

540
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,110
我在营地的第一个晚上
It was my first night at the camp.

541
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,070
我们像幽灵一样移动
We move like ghosts.

542
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,990
寂静无声
In silence.

543
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,030
你们也一样
So will you.

544
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,320
第一个哭出来的女孩
So the first girl to cry out?

545
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
就输了
She loses.

546
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,960
准备好了吗?
You ready?

547
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,020
我无声无息地杀了她
I murdered her without making a sound.

548
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:09,610
后来允许我说话了
Then when I was allowed to speak again...

549
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
可我说不出来了
I couldn't.

550
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,790
当时你别无选择
You did not have a choice.

551
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,790
我当然有选择
Of course I did.

552
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,880
让他们杀了我 总比我对那个女孩做的事强
Better they kill me, than what I did to that girl.

553
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,630
比我对很多女孩做的事都强
What I did to lots of girls.

554
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,110
我看着镜子里的自己 感到无比厌恶
I look in the mirror and hate what I see.

555
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,480
所以我比你想像的
So I understand,

556
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,900
更理解你的感受
more than you know.

557
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,820
你不应该恨自己
You should not hate yourself.

558
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,370
那你也不应该
Then neither should you.

559
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,140
我们怎么可能原谅自己?
How can we possibly forgive ourselves?

560
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,510
我们怎样才能继续活下去?
How can we move on?

561
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,740
病毒准备就绪时 我们应该释放他 不是吗?
When the virus is ready, we should set him free, no?

562
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,250
布彻尔会不高兴的
Butcher won't be happy.

563
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,960
那这一定是正确的做法
Then it must be the right thing to do.

564
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,260
宝贝 是你吗?
Babe, that you?

565
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,390
是的 宝贝
Yeah, babe.

566
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,680
你能给我买些生鱼片吗?
Can you pick me up some Sugarfish?

567
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,260
不行 我们已经讨论过这事了
No. We've talked about this.

568
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,270
我不能参与屠杀长鳍金枪鱼
I can't take part in the slaughter of albacore.

569
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,980
我有个最好的朋友就是长鳍金枪鱼
One of my ride-or-dies is an albacore.

570
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,850
好吧 所以我既不能待在想待的地方
Okay, so I don't get to stay where I want

571
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,360
也不能吃想吃的东西
or eat what I want.

572
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,870
这话什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

573
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,320
“有时 怎样获得就怎样失去”
"Sometimes the way you get them is the way you lose them."

574
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,860
为什么引用丽莎范德庞普的话?
Why are you quoting Lisa Vanderpump?

575
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,990
我知道智者的事
I know about Sage.

576
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,410
说什么呢 智者?
What are you talking about? Sage?

577
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,870
别以为假装对我好 就能瞒天过海 凯文
Don't patronize me, Kevin. I've known for a while.

578
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
我已经知道一段时间了
My suckers can smell her on you

579
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,580
你们幽会之后 在你身上
after your trysts.

580
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,880
我的吸盘能感受到她的味道 就像现在这样
Like the one you're coming from now.

581
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,500
我真的很爱你
I love you so much.

582
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,760
你温柔的心 你无畏的写作
Your gentle heart, your fearless writing.

583
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,970
你能诚实地说她像我一样爱你吗?
Can you honestly say she feels the same?

584
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,320
我现在不知道该怎么跟你说
Look, I don't know what to tell you right now.

585
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,890
试着说实话
Try the truth.

586
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,140
还不算太晚
It's not too late.

587
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,970
这份爱值得为之奋斗
This is worth fighting for.

588
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,390
我们的爱值得为之奋斗
We're worth fighting for.

589
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,310
智者根本不可能像我这么关心你
There's no way Sage cares about you the way that I do.

590
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,560
她说我是高人一等的生物!
She says that I'm a superior being,

591
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,270
她是人类
and she has four limbs.

592
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,070
这不公平!
That is not fair.

593
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,490
情况如此 无可奈何
Yeah, well, it is what it is.

594
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,110
这是句愚蠢 空洞的话
That's a dumb, nothing phrase,

595
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,490
说这话的是 愚蠢的人?
spoken by...Dumb people?

596
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,280
愚蠢的人?你残酷无情时令我讨厌
Dumb people? I hate it when you get nasty.

597
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,430
我有什么选择?谈敏感问题时 你根本不顾及我的感受
Well, what choice do I have, when you're rubbing my face in it?

598
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,290
我享乐一次 有什么大不了的?
Oh, what, that I'm happy for once?!

599
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,040
对不起 我为你感到遗憾
I'm sorry!I feel sorry for you.

600
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,460
为我感到遗憾?看看你那副德行
For me? For me? Look at you.

601
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,710
你意识到她并不尊重你时就不会笑了
You won't be laughing when you realize she doesn't respect you.

602
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,340
但她确实尊重我!
She does respect me!

603
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,180
醒醒吧 凯文 她在利用你
Wake up, Kevin. She's using you.

604
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,820
闭嘴!你正在为了一个认为你很可悲的女人
You shut the fuck up!You're throwing us away for a woman

605
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,640
损耗我们的感情
who thinks you're pathetic...

606
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,810
凯文!凯文!
Kevin! Kevin!

607
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,100
回来
Come back!

608
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,270
求你了 凯文!求你了
Please, Kevin, please.

609
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,060
求你了 凯文
Please, Kevin.

610
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,650
凯文 我 我无法呼吸
Kevin, I-I-I can't breathe.

611
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,040
求你 什么?
Please...What?

612
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,450
天哪凯文
Oh, my God.Kevin!

613
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,000
求你了!
Please!

614
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,140
他妈的
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

615
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,230
凯文!
Kevin!

616
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,520
开门!妈的!
Open the door!Fuck.

617
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,820
我爱 你
I love... you.

618
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,490
好
Okay.

619
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,780
喂 深海 深海?
Deep? Deep?

620
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,780
你都明白了吗?是的 先生
Did you get all that?Yes, sir.

621
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,160
我现在终于清楚了
I finally have clarity now.

622
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,450
好的
Good.

623
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,930
你想杀谁 我就去杀 随时听你派遣
I will kill whoever you want me to kill, whenever you want me to kill them.

624
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,080
你一声令下 我就会杀死海洋里所有该死的鱼
I'll kill every goddamn fish in the ocean if you say so.

625
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,840
好
Okay.

626
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,970
好样的
Attaboy. Um...

627
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,260
去做吧
Well, get to it.

628
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,070
当选副总统女士?在呢
Madam Vice President-elect?Yeah?

629
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,150
有人来见您
There's someone here to see you.

630
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,460
我会很想念纽约的杂货店
Fuck, I'm gonna miss New York bodegas.

631
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,010
听着 我们需要谈谈
Listen, we need to talk.

632
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,260
你仍然可以阻止这一切 罢手吧
You can still stop all this, all right? Just stop.

633
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,820
想让我改变主意 你肯定是黔驴技穷了
You must be pretty desperate if you're throwing a Hail Mary like this. Jesus...

634
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,410
五分钟 可以吗?
Five minutes, all right? Just five minutes

635
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,320
不说废话 我们俩好好谈谈
where we cut the bullshit and we talk, just you and me,

636
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,890
情况有多么糟糕
about how fucked all this is.

637
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,350
这是政治 你知道的
What it is, is politics. You know how it goes,

638
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,560
为达目的求同存异罢了
strange bedfellows.

639
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,750
这可不是在跟米特罗姆尼合作
Yeah, but it's not like you're palling around with Mitt Romney.

640
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,010
你在跟祖国人合作!
You're working with Homelander.

641
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,650
他要刺杀总统
He's gonna kill the president.

642
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,860
这话从我嘴里说出来 听起来难以置信
That sounds fucking insane coming out of my mouth.

643
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,870
祖国人把星光追随者们
And when Homelander chucks all the Starlighters

644
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,350
都关进拘留营
into internment camps, you're just,

645
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,790
你也觉得无所谓吗?
you're cool with that, too?

646
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,250
你对拘留营一无所知
You didn't know about the camps.

647
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,630
你觉得为什么自己 被请到了泰克骑士庄园?
Why do you think that you were at Tek-Knight's?

648
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,670
要用他的监狱做拘留营 我得接着打包了
That's what his prisons are for.I got to get back to it.

649
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,090
我手上还有对你不利的证据 你在泰克骑士庄园里说的话
I still have all the dirt on you. What you said at Tek-Knight's.

650
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,300
每一个字
Everything.

651
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,430
这是威胁吗?
Is that a threat?

652
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,770
不是
No.

653
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,770
因为我们一发布 你就会杀了我们所有人
Because when we drop it, then you'll kill us all.

654
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,270
像你说的 肯定会两败俱伤
Like you said, mutually assured destruction.

655
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,150
但并非一定要两败俱伤
But it doesn't have to be that way.

656
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,540
如果你还尚存一丝人性 就像从前的你
And if you're even, like, one percent of the person that I knew,

657
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,340
那么 我认为你并不想这样做
then I don't think you really want to do this.

658
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,900
你还来得及罢手
You can still step back.

659
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,240
维琪 现在还不算太晚
Vic, it's not too late.

660
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,750
感谢你过来见我
Thanks for coming by.

661
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,130
你父亲的事
I'm sorry...

662
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,510
我很遗憾
...to hear about your dad.

663
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,240
休伊还是不接电话 我很担心他
Hughie's still not answering. I'm worried about him.

664
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,950
还好吗 小可爱?
Sup, cum burgers?

665
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,740
你他妈的怎么来了?
The fuck you doing here?

666
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,700
祖国人受够你了 兄弟
Homelander is sick of your shit, bro.

667
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,410
说要帮你脱离苦海
Said to put you out of your misery.

668
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,540
所以派了你来?
And he sent you?

669
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,380
看来给章鱼舔屄还不够你忙的
Sure you ain't too busy tongue lashing your octo-pussy?

670
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,840
才没有 我从没
What? No. I never...

671
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,880
他不光派了我来
He didn't just send me.

672
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
知道吗?
Do you know what?

673
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,690
我不敢相信自己会说这种话
I can't believe I'm saying this,

674
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,690
但现在是圣诞节
but it's Christmas.

675
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,200
你们两个笨蛋赶快逃吧
You two twats leg it right now,

676
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,700
我们会忘记你们来过这里什么
and we'll forget you was ever here.

677
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,040
伙计?我几乎听不懂你说话
What, dude? I can barely understand you,

678
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,580
你的口音太重了 你到底想要怎样 深海?
your accent's insane.What the fuck do you want, Deep?

679
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,540
讨个正义 你个婊子
Justice, you fucking bitch.

680
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,130
天哪 我会非常享受杀掉你
God, I'm gonna enjoy this so much.

681
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,050
首先 你想害我被封杀
First, you tried to cancel me,

682
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,480
陷害我这个无辜者
victimize an innocent man because I guess

683
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,070
因为现在 这样对待白人男性会显得很酷
that's just cool to do to white guys nowadays.

684
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,590
结果你自食其果 “我也是”
But joke's on you. #MeToo's over,

685
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,390
反性骚扰运动已经终结了 毫无结果
sweetheart, it didn't work.

686
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,140
我觉得你说的并不是真相
I do not respect your truth.

687
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,690
我不尊重 也不珍惜你的故事
I do not honor and cherish your story.

688
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,610
我他妈的才不会道歉呢
And I do not fucking apologize.

689
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,160
这傻逼有嗜睡症
Cunt's narcoleptic.

690
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,180
凯斯勒
Kessler,

691
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,600
无论你对以西结做了什么
whatever you did to Ezekiel,

692
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,890
再做一遍
do it again.

693
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,820
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

694
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,200
等等 你是泄密者?
Wait, are you... You're the leak?

695
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,950
他说话了?
Did he just talk?

696
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,790
兄弟?是你吗 兄弟?
Bro, it was you, bro?

697
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,160
深海 告诉你一声 我一直
Deep, just FYI, I have always,

698
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,000
一直都很讨厌你
always fucking hated your ass.

699
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,880
他妈的 你会飞?
Fuck, he can fly?

700
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,380
叫你好看 傻
Eat a flying dick, motherfuck...

701
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,690
玄色很快就回来了 我们快走吧
Noir will be back up here in no time, so let's go.

702
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,020
他就在这儿 我们干掉他吧
He's right fucking there. Let's do him.

703
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,150
你知道怎么干掉他吗 布彻尔? 我可不知道
You know how, Butcher? 'Cause I don't,

704
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,030
但玄色肯定知道怎么干掉我们
but Noir sure as hell's gonna know how to fucking kill us.

705
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,700
所以 是快走吧
Now, come the fuck on.

706
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,370
亚莉克莎 播放戴夫马修斯的
Alexa, play "Dave Matthews Chill Mix."

707
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,210
平静混音音乐 亚莉克莎 求你别播火车头
Playing Dave Matthews...Alexa, please fucking don't.

708
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,420
搞什么?
What the fuck, A-Train?

709
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,340
听着 我们得走了 现在就走
Listen, we got to go, now.

710
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,260
深海和玄色知道我是泄密者了 等等
Deep and Noir know that I'm the leak.

711
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,320
什么?祖国人很快就会知道该死的混蛋
Wait, what?Homelander's about to find out any second.

712
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,320
你有说过我的事吗?
Did you say anything about me, you fucking asshole?

713
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,310
当然没有 我什么也没说
No, of course not. I didn't say anything.

714
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,720
火车头 搞什么?艾诗丽
A-Train, what the fuck? What the fuck?Ashley.

715
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:29,730
这是我们的机会 失不再来
This is our chance. This is our chance.

716
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,190
佛罗伦萨 哪里都行
Florence, anywhere,

717
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,770
但我们这就得走
but let's go.

718
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,200
我不能走
I can't.

719
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,830
那你自便吧 等等
Suit yourself.Wait, wait.

720
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,090
你的芯片
Your chip.

721
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,000
别忘了把它取出来
Don't forget to cut it out.

722
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,920
不好意思 你是星光 对吧?
Hi, sorry, you're Starlight, right?

723
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,250
我可以拍张自拍吗?好的
Oh, um...Can I just get a selfie?

724
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,860
拍得很好
Oh, that's a good one.

725
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,340
好 谢谢 谢谢
Okay. Thank you.Thanks.

726
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,970
要怎么办 M?
So what's it gonna be, M?

727
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,970
你要帮我们阻止暗杀和暴力叛乱?
You gonna help us stop an assassination, a violent insurrection?

728
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,470
还是说会置之不理?
Or you off to have a wank?

729
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,240
看来是要置之不理
Looks like a wank then.

730
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,410
凯斯勒是谁?
Who's Kessler?

731
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,040
凯斯勒?在办公室大楼里
Kessler?In the Flatiron.

732
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,620
你喊了一个名字“凯斯勒”
You shouted a name, "Kessler,"

733
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,290
说了些跟以西结有关的事情
and something that had to do with Ezekiel.

734
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,250
那是怎么回事?
What was that?

735
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,300
不知道你在说些什么 亲爱的
No idea what you're on about there, luv.Hmm.

736
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,010
你真的不来了
You're really not coming.

737
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,480
只好以后再喝朗姆潘趣酒了 宝贝
Those rum punches are gonna have to wait, babe.

738
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,020
珍妮需要你
Janine needs you.

739
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,520
亲爱的 我别无所求 只有一个目标
Monique, the one thing I've wanted more than anything,

740
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,650
我每晚都祈祷它会实现
my one prayer every night,

741
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,070
就是再次跟你和珍妮
has been to be with you and Janine again.

742
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,150
成为一家人
To be a family.

743
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,740
但如果我不得不这样保护你们俩
But if I'm gonna protect you two the way I have to,

744
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,370
我就无法实现这个目标
I can't.

745
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,370
我就
I just...

746
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,290
做不到
I can't.

747
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,130
也许某天会实现
Maybe one day.

748
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,040
也许?“也许”是什么意思 马文?
"Maybe"? What the hell's that supposed to mean, Marvin? Maybe?

749
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,670
我得挂了 宝贝马文 等等
I got to go, babe.Marvin, wait...

750
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,440
祖国人?
Homelander?

751
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,110
祖国人?
Homelander?

752
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,820
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

753
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,030
火车头?
A-Train?

754
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,320
他怎么可以这样对我?
I'm so...How could he do this to me?

755
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,070
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

756
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,490
你知道 有些人就是
You know, some folks are just...

757
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,500
他们生来就傲慢自负
...well, they're born uppity.

758
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,040
他在哪里?
Where is he?

759
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,000
他取出了追踪芯片
He cut out his tracking chip.

760
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,920
他的家人也消失了
And his family's gone, too.

761
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,380
当然
Of course.

762
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,970
你派了深海和玄色去杀布彻尔?
You sent Deep and Noir after Butcher?

763
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,300
我们讨论过这事
We talked about this.

764
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,930
世界上最聪明的人
Smartest person in the world,

765
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,520
却不知道火车头是泄密者?
and you didn't know A-Train was the leak?

766
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,680
我知道
I knew.

767
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,980
你知道
You knew.

768
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,360
却让我们无缘无故地杀死网络喷子?
And you let us kill Webweaver for nothing?

769
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,990
妈的
Oh, shit.

770
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,070
你们杀了网络喷子?
You killed Webweaver?

771
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,280
你们以为他是泄密者?
Did you think he was the leak?

772
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,620
他这个瘾君子 只要能让他回家接着吸毒
He was a junkie who'd confess to nailing Christ on the cross

773
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,790
把基督钉在十字架上这种事 他都会承认
if it got him home for his next fix.

774
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,750
我说得很清楚
I was very clear.

775
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,040
别再隐藏秘密了
No more secrets.

776
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,630
但火车头只是泄露了
But A-Train only leaked

777
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,380
我想让布彻尔及其团队知道的信息
exactly the information I wanted Butcher and his team to know.

778
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,260
在此之前 他一直都是传递错误信息的完美人选
He was the perfect misinformation delivery system.Until now.

779
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,850
这都是计划的一部分
This was all part of the plan.

780
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,810
好吧
Okay.

781
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,980
滚吧 你走人吧
Get the fuck out of here. You're done.

782
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,440
回到你在底特律的小垃圾公寓里
Go back to your little litter box in Detroit

783
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,320
孤独地死去吧
and die alone.

784
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,230
你答应过我的
You promised.

785
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,070
你答应过我你会听我的
You promised me you would listen to me.

786
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,860
我没把你大卸八块寄回家 已经算你走运了
You're lucky I'm not sending you home in a bucket.

787
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,080
滚
Go.

788
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,660
好吧 身边只留下她这种人
Fine, surround yourself with people like her.

789
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,960
你可以系统地消除任何妨碍你的人
Then you can systematically eliminate anyone who gets in your way,

790
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,710
但有一个人 你永远无法打败
but there's one person you will never, ever defeat.

791
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,590
没了我 祝你好运
Good luck without me.

792
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,770
我们不需要她
We don't need her.

793
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,900
出去
Just-just get out.

794
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,270
你确定
Are you sure there's...

795
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,700
没有我能为你做的事吗?
...nothing I can...do for you?

796
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,200
确定
No.

797
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,700
快滚出去吧 好
Oh, just get the fuck out.Okay. Mm-hmm.

798
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,540
兄弟
Bro?

799
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,170
兄弟!
Bro!

800
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,380
兄弟?
Bro?

801
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,470
兄弟
Bro.

802
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,510
是的

803
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,010
兄弟
Bro.

804
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:59,580
兄弟
Bro.

805
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,640
是的

806
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,440
你好呀
Hey, you.

807
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,480
我们今天很不顺
Hey, so we've had a day.

808
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,770
等等 急什么?
Wait, what's the rush?

809
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,320
祖国人 他解雇了我
Homelander. He fired me.

810
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,360
等等 但你不能离开 我爱你
Wait, but you can't leave. I love you.

811
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,910
我们有真感情 不是吗?等等
We have something special, don't we?Wait.

812
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,410
她对自己进行脑白质切除术后 也操你吗?
Is she lobotomizing herself to fuck you, too?

813
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,330
她没做什么脑白质切除术啊
What do you mean, "lobotomizing herself"?

814
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,540
兄弟
Bro.

815
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,420
你是对的 准备好了
You were right. It's ready.

816
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,180
甘油梯度
The glycerol gradient.

817
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,760
即使在一个破烂的实验室里也有效
Uh, it worked.Even in a shitty lab.

818
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,810
进行眼底萤光素血管造影测试后
After we do an FFA test,

819
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,820
如果病毒发挥作用
see that the virus is working,

820
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,690
我们就要告诉你个好消息 我的朋友
we have some good news for you, mon ami.

821
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,110
不
No!

822
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,240
喜美子
Kimiko.

823
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,570
不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

824
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,170
没关系
Okay.

825
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,050
没关系
It's okay.

826
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,390
没关系
Okay.

827
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,810
心肝 看着我
Mon coeur, look at me.

828
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,400
抓住这个 专心看这个
Take this. Focus on this.

829
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,280
对不起!
I'm sorry!

830
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:49,500
你是蜜蜂的膝盖

831
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,430
你没事

832
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,220
没关系
It's okay.

833
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,390
你没事
You're okay.

834
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,060
嘿 你没事
Yeah. You're okay.

835
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,530
而你却没有意识到萨米尔想跑?
You didn't twig to what Sameer was up to?

836
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,360
被锁得那么牢 他一定是已经准备了好几天
Well, with bindings so thick, he must have worked them for days.

837
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,260
也许好几周 不是吗?好吧
Maybe weeks. No?All right. All right.

838
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,410
重要的是 如果萨米尔能从死羊身上提取出病毒
What matters is if Sameer can get the bug out of a sheep's head,

839
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,620
法兰奇就可以 从喜美子的断腿里提取出病毒
Frenchie can get it out of Kimiko's gam.

840
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,590
我们知道病毒是有效的
All right, so, we know the virus works,

841
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,600
但它足够强大吗?足以杀死祖国人吗?
but is it strong enough?To kill Homelander?

842
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,550
杀不死 但杀死纽曼?
No. But to kill Neuman at least?

843
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,970
是有可能的
C'est possible.

844
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,510
好几个星期了 结果只是个“可能”?
We've been on this for weeks, and all we have is a maybe?

845
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,180
各位
Yo...

846
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,980
为什么都板着脸?
Why all the grim faces?

847
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,560
以前比这糟糕 但我们都挺过来了
We've done more with less.

848
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,900
我们绝不容许任何人暗杀总统
Ain't nobody gonna murk the president, not on our fuckin' watch.

849
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:01,700
法兰奇 病毒不会凭空出现 兄弟
Frenchie, that virus...it ain't gonna cook itself, brother.

850
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,530
开工啦
All right, let's go.

851
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,160
快点 混蛋们
Chop, chop, motherfuckers.

852
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,460
莱恩 是爸爸
Ryan, it's Dad.

853
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,130
听着 儿子 最近太忙了 我很抱歉
Hey, listen, buddy, I-I'm sorry I've been so busy lately,

854
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:19,380
但我听说你不大同意拍那个 布偶戏的节目
but I hear you're having some issues with the-the puppet show thing.

855
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,840
我手头上事情很多 儿子 所以
Um, look, I got a lot going on here, buddy, so, uh, do me a favor.

856
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:25,180
帮我个忙 不要抱怨 拍就是了
Just-just suck it up and-and do it.

857
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,430
好吗?为了我 太好了 爱你 很好 再见
All right? For me. Terrific. Love you. Great. Bye.

858
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:40,700
发现可疑情况就举报 致电18001 沃特

859
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,740
可能是攫取福利的贪婪者

860
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,700
也可能是老师想要灌输什么

861
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,500
或是社会主义者说美国不伟大

862
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,290
竖起耳朵 仔细观察

863
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,130
但无论怎样 别闭口不言

864
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,220
发现可疑情况就举报

865
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,840
拿起电话拨打号码

866
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,850
发现可疑情况就举报

867
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,930
超人类为我们创造安全的世界

868
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,980
可能是不信任警察的人

869
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,270
当西恩潘说应该制止超人类

870
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,020
他来了
There he is.

871
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,320
我需要你的时候 你他妈的在哪里?
Where the fuck were you when I needed you?

872
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,240
沉默对待是双向的
Silent treatment goes both ways.

873
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,030
可能是制造疫苗的科学家

874
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,660
那个长着胡子的变装皇后

875
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,830
移民不停地

876
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,000
停下来 快停下来
Stop. Stop. Just stop.

877
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:43,170
这首歌不行
This song isn't cool.

878
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,550
老实说 这些都不行
Honestly, none of this is cool.

879
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,890
快他妈的切广告
Go to fucking commercial!

880
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:49,060
不 不要切广告
No. Don't go to commercial.

881
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,770
继续拍 拜托了
Keep rolling, please.

882
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,740
你的家人不是敌人
Your family isn't your enemy.

883
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,200
你的家人是你的全部
Your family is all you've got.

884
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,870
最近我总在想我妈
I've been thinking about my mom a lot lately.

885
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,920
她死了
She died.

886
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,920
但她很喜欢圣诞节
But she loved Christmas.

887
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,010
喜欢用锐滋糖果做的棉花糖夹心饼干
And s'mores with Reese's.

888
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:29,720
喜欢看《母女情深》
And Terms of Endearment.

889
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,390
她爱自己的丈夫比利
And she loved her husband Billy.

890
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,480
但她不会喜欢这个布偶节目
But she wouldn't love this.

891
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,270
她不会希望我拍这个
She wouldn't want me doing it.

892
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,730
我妈总是告诉我要说实话
My mom always told me to tell the truth...

893
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,700
因此
...which is why...

894
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,540
对不起
I'm sorry.

895
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,500
这就是为何
And that...

896
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,040
我对这孩子充满信心
...is why I got faith in the kid,

897
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,590
太他妈的让我骄傲了
you little fucking beauty.

898
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,890

00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,550
其实 我今天没去急诊室
I, uh... I didn't actually go to urgent care today.

902
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,050
我看得出来
Yeah, I could tell.

903
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,430
是的 我去找维琪了
Yeah. Well, I... I went to go see Vicky.

904

我没事 只是
I'm okay. It's just...

906
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:04,480
我不知道 我想也许 自己可以说服她罢手 或者
I don't know. I thought maybe I could talk her out of it, or...

907
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,030
结果呢?
And...?

908
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,740
是什么让你
what made you...

909
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:17,910
我只是想试试
I-I... just thought I would... try it on.

910
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,710
好吧 感觉怎么样?
Okay. How-How's it... feel?

911
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,460
感觉很烦人
Feels annoying...

912
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,050
因为你是对的
that you were right.

913
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:31,630
我们一步一步来
We'll take it... step by step,

914
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,760
一次处理一个麻烦
one dumpster fire at a time.

915
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,640
所以 你是说我给出了天才的建议
So, you're saying, I give genius advice.

916
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,850
别太得意了
Don't push it.

917
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,650
现在
Now...

918
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,780
承认吧
admit it.

919
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:51,030
你留下战衣时
You have fantasized

920
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,490
幻想过这一幕
about... keeping this suit on for this.

921
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,080
我并非没有幻想过
I haven't...not fantasized about it.
