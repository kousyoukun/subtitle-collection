00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,580
Why are we doing a teen show, anyway?

470
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,040
Um, 'cause we like money.

471
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,333
If you don't want to do it...

472
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,419
...don't.

473
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,713
Don't do it.

474
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,131
I mean it.

475
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,568
I'm just gonna pop the horns up here
a little bit and play devil's advocate.

476
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:28,819
We are a month away from shooting.

477
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:32,180
Built all the sets. I think we bought up
half the sound stages in Toronto.

478
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,807
- Who cares?
- [quietly] Is this because I jerked it

479
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,611
in front of Minka Kelly? Because,
again, that was just crossed wires.

480
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:43,357
Hey, guy, what's it gonna take
to get you amped?

481
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,710
Do you want a E.P. credit?
That is done.

482
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,319
You want to get script approval?

483
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,642
- I can make anything sing...
- Give him your black Amex.

484
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:49,989
What?

485
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,075
You want... You know what?

486
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,744
Why don't you take my whole wallet.

487
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,500
- And the keys to your Jaguar.
- I would love...

488
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,710
- to do that.
- [keys jingle]

489
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,212
[forced chuckle]

490
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,213
Ryan, what do you say?

491
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,010
No.

492
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,056
Yeah.

493
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,724
[door opens]

494
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,356
So, you're... you're really not mad at me?

495
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:27,193
No. I'm proud of you
for speaking your mind.

496
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,446
Ryan...

497
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,032
[sighs] I've been, uh...

498
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,994
manipulated by people my whole life.

499
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:40,456
Being told what to say, where to stand.

500
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,960
It-It's like being a slave, only worse.

501
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,420
I did some reflecting,

502
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:51,592
and I realized that I've been doing
the same thing to you.

503
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,347
But no more.

504
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,182
From now on, no more rules.

505
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,476
For either of us.

506
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,146
We are both emancipated from slavery.

507
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,856
We're free.

508
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,441
Sound good?

509
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,735
- Yeah. [chuckles]
- Yeah?

510
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,488
Oh, buddy, I-I don't care
what anyone else thinks but you.

511
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:17,994
Far as I'm concerned,
this whole planet is empty.

512
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:20,746
Except for you and me.

513
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,956
[both chuckle]

514
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,542
[wind whistles]

515
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,674
As if you don't have 60 more pairs.

516
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,427
Prince Andrew gave me these shoes.

517
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,471
I'm suddenly reminded of
how much I hated it here.

518
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:40,391
Really? I used to love it.

519
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,868
I always felt a little more free here.

520
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,936
And yet you've turned my farm

521
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,706
- into an infectious disease lab.
- [agent] Clear.

522
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,401
I can only assume that you're searching
for a way to control Homelander.

523
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:55,448
You know, he's a Freudian cesspool
of random impulse and deep insecurity.

524
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,575
There's no one who can control that.

525
00:26:57,658 --> 00:27:00,578
You've put yourself and Zoe
in terrible danger.

526
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,081
No. You put me and Zoe in terrible danger.

527
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:07,793
You used me like you use everybody else.
Somebody had to protect her.

528
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,879
You mean shooting her up with Compound V.

529
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,048
You took a bright-eyed little girl,

530
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,400
- and you turned her into a...
- Into a what?

531
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,467
A monster?

532
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,510
Is that why you had me hide what I was?

533
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,763
Stick to the shadows,
never reach too high?

534
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,139
- That was to protect you.
- No,

535
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,891
that was because you were ashamed of me.

536
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,145
My daughter will never have to
live like that.

537
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,695
So, what's gonna happen when we find
the virus and this little truce is over?

538
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,909
Starlight blinds the bitch,
before she knows what's what,

539
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,328
- I'll jab her with a dose.
- Okay.

540
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,624
[creaking]

541
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,626
[chickens clucking]

542
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,304
[wings fluttering]

543
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,395
[agent] We've got a casualty.

544
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,647
[tense music playing]

545
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,608
Is that Sameer?

546
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,320
No, it's one of his lab assistants.

547
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,406
[chickens clucking]

548
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,784
What the hell is...

549
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,994
[all gasping, exclaiming]

550
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,955
V'd-up fucking chicken!

551
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,748
[gunfire]

552
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,625
- [gunfire continues]
- [crackling]

553
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,256
[clucking]

554
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,681
[gunfire continues]

555
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,015
Fuck this.

556
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,268
[exciting music playing]

557
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,040
- [chicken clucks]
- [doors rattle]

558
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,732
[Butcher] Well, you could've warned us

559
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,819
your pal Sameer was V-ing up
a Kentucky Fried fucking massacre,

560
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,070
couldn't ya?

561
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,132
I didn't know, okay?
Something obviously went wrong.

562
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,883
- We have to find him.
- [Butcher] Yeah, right.

563
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,659
And we're supposed to believe you?

564
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,911
You eat, sleep and shit lies, don't you?

565
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,795
Right, 'cause you're such
a paragon of virtue.

566
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,558
You tell your friends about
the deal we made?

567
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,417
Wait, wh-what does that mean?

568
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,020
Said he'd steal all your files you had
on me if I gave him Ryan.

569
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,089
Are you fucking kidding me?

570
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:20,259
And I didn't go through with it, did I?
Which proves I'm on the level.

571
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,571
When are we gonna learn?
He's never gonna fucking change.

572
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,848
All right, listen.
We got a lot of ground to cover,

573
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,683
so let's just go.

574
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,729
It's an absolute wonder to me
that you've all managed to live this long.

575
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:42,406
What? I didn't go through with it.

576
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,284
- [soft music playing]
- [Cameron] Ooh, that's nice.

577
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,703
[clears throat] Excuse me. Hi.

578
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,748
Did I say you could take out
your vibrating Bluetooth anal beads?

579
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:55,252
- Go pop them back in right now.
- [button clicking]

580
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,963
- This is an important event.
- Uh-huh.

581
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:01,217
You really expect me to come onstage
in front of our most loyal fans?

582
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,180
Oh, yeah. I want everyone to know what
a grubby little queef-sniffer you are.

583
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,307
Huh. [sighs heavily]

584
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,976
I'm sorry. This wasn't
how I was planning to tell you,

585
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,812
but, um, this isn't working out
for me anymore.

586
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,857
I mean, it was one thing when
you were really in charge around here,

587
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:19,109
but now, I mean...

588
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,655
You...

589
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,741
are dumping me?

590
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,411
I need a dom who's dominating.

591
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:31,747
You know?

592
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,833
But, uh, I hope we can still be friends.

593
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:50,391
Hmm. Is this your angry look,
or did Starlight fuck up your face?

594
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,810
You know, if you weren't
Homelander's right-hand bitch,

595
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,062
I'd take you out behind the woodshed
and whup your ass.

596
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,522
Mm, sounds on-brand.

597
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,526
You set me up to get my ass beat.

598
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,986
And you fell for it.

599
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,364
But, hey,
now you don't have to play a victim.

600
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,907
You can really be one.

601
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:10,619
[scoffs] Y'all just think
I'm stupid poor white trash.

602
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,288
I don't think you're poor.

603
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,164
Underestimate me all you want.

604
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,627
Makes it that much easier to
stick a fucking shiv in your back.

605
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,600
Frenchie okay?

606
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,315
{\an8}Oh.

607
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,441
Are you okay?

608
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,825
[coughs]

609
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,751
I noticed you're having a little, uh...

610
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,170
projectile dysfunction.

611
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,296
Yeah, you know what?

612
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,673
Why don't you worry about yourself, okay?

613
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:08,510
I am. You're not much use to us
if your powers are on the fuckin' fritz.

614
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,555
Saw you beat the piss out of
Firecracker on national television.

615
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,475
Don't get me wrong,
I enjoyed the hell out of it, but, um,

616
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,934
don't you think it was a little...

617
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,269
out of control?

618
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,272
We can't lose our cool like that.

619
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,483
We?

620
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,836
Come on, Annie. I'm one of
the only people who does get it.

621
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,862
Dual identities.

622
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,865
I'm still Nadia. You think I don't
want to let her out sometimes?

623
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,368
But I can't. I got to be Neuman.

624
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,662
And, shit, you've been
Starlight for so long,

625
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,265

00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,160
And you come, too.

791
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,080
[Ryan] Um...

792
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,624
...is he making you uncomfortable?

793
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:19,936
- Uh...
- No, you can tell me.

794
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,545
You won't get in trouble.

795
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:23,922
Um...

796
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,216
Kind of.

797
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:28,260
Yeah.

798
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,886
[Homelander] Ryan?

799
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,555
What do you think?

800
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:39,187
Adam, I think you should apologize.

801
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,067
Uh, I'm sorry if I was inappropriate.

802
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,196
Didn't seem like you meant it.

803
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,174
Uh, yeah, that's just...
that's just my natural tone.

804
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,658
Maybe the problem is that

805
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:56,079
Adam is looking down on the P.A.

806
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,457
- Yeah.
- [Homelander] Mm-hmm.

807
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:02,002
Yeah, um...

808
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,046
Adam, I think you should
get on your knees and do it again.

809
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,680
[coughs]

810
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:23,356
I'm sorry if I

811
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,443
exploited our inequitable power dynamic,

812
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:27,886
and I made you feel uncomfortable.

813
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,988
Please forgive me.

814
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,574
- He's still lying.
- Mm-hmm. I agree.

815
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:37,370
I think maybe he needs to be
taught a lesson.

816
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,832
[whispers]

817
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:42,375
[both chuckle]

818
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,174
I want you to slap him.

819
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,679
Bonnie...

820
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,473
[grunts] Oh! Oh, fuck.

821
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,557
Do it again.

822
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:58,892
[cries out] Okay...

823
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,560
- Again.
- [Adam] Homelander...

824
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,103
- [slaps]
- Oh! Fuck me.

825
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,272
- [slaps]
- [grunts] I'm sorry. Stop, please.

826
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,690
- [slaps]
- [Adam grunting]

827
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,859
[slapping continues]

828
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:10,570
[Adam grunting]

829
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,448
Bonnie, please. Please!

830
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,533
- Homelander, pl...
- [slaps]

831
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,211
Please, can we take a break?

832
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,964
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

833
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,423
Right.

834
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:36,888
[sighs]

835
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,683
I didn't know you were a Catholic.

836
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:43,645
Something about the drama of it appeals.

837
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,438
- [chuckles]
- You know?

838
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,565
Do you still believe in God?

839
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:51,528
I want to.

840
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,241
It's just, uh...

841
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,995
It's just so hard sometimes.

842
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,121
And you?

843
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,914
With all my heart.

844
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,459
The trinity, the resurrection,

845
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:09,671
the sacraments... all of it.

846
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,634
Well, except for
the Sacraments of Penance.

847
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,137
Come on.

848
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,472
What a steaming pile of dog shit that is.

849
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:21,683
I really kind of think that

850
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,144
forgiving is...

851
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,646
- is important.
- Forgiving, <i>oui.</i>

852
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,149
But not being forgiven.

853
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,318
What, I confess to some priest

854
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,069
I don't even know in a peep show booth,

855
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:34,779
and all my sins wash away?

856
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:38,033
Dog shit.

857
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:44,831
Some sins God should not forgive.

858
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,959
Some sins deserve eternal damnation.

859
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,628
Frenchie...

860
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:53,381
...what have you done?

861
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:55,425
It is not just one thing, you see.

862
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,470
It is so many things.

863
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,015
You should really talk to someone.

864
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,269
You should. I mean, have you told Kimiko?

865
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,689
[Frenchie] If I tell her...

866
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,110
...I'm scared she'll hate me.

867
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,948
I'm even more scared she won't.

868
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,578
[wood crashing]

869
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,829
[snorts]

870
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:27,916
[bellowing]

871
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,170
[snorts]

872
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,507
Is that a fucking V'd-up bull?

873
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,258
- [mutters in French]
- Oh, my God.

874
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,551
[snorts]

875
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:41,096
Off we fuck, nice and slow.

876
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,724
[all exclaiming]

877
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,230
This is fucking crazy.

878
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,566
- Run!
- [screeches]

879
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,236
Come on. Go!

880
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,530
- [Annie] Oh, my God.
- [screeches]

881
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,865
[intense dramatic music playing]

882
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,952
- [screeches]
- [gasps]

883
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:06,496
[screaming]

884
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,500
[Frenchie] Come on.

885
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,173
Let's go!

886
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:24,848
- [screeches]
- [all panting]

887
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,434
- [Annie sighs]
- [Frenchie] Oh, <i>mon Dieu.</i>

888
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:29,894
I can't believe this is fucking happening
to me again.

889
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,317
Oh, my God, Sameer.

890
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:40,113
- [Neuman] Are you okay?
- [Sameer] Yeah.

891
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:43,199
I'm fine, but, uh, Henry...

892
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,536
Wait. Zoe's not here, is she?

893
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,556
- Because... No?
- No, no. She's okay. She's okay.

894
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,790
- [Sameer] Okay, good.
- [Annie] Wait. Oh, my God,

895
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:52,709
is that Zoe's dad?

896
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,462
[Edgar] Dr. Shah was my top man

897
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:57,297
at Vought R&D

898
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,883
before he went behind my back

899
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,342
and deflowered my daughter.

900
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,762
Okay, I was 20, thoroughly deflowered,
and this isn't the time or the place.

901
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,973
What happened?

902
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,934
We gave, uh, V to a hamster,
so we could test the virus on it.

903
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:12,437
Oh, a V'd-up hamster
was your first mistake, <i>mon ami.</i>

904
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,107
It got loose. Trashed the lab. We ran,

905
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:17,918
but the V had already leaked
into the ground water.

906
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,110
Is the virus gone?

907
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:20,778
Yes.

908
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:21,862
Fuck.

909
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,492
Except for, uh...

910
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,577
Except for one dose.

911
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,662
[dramatic music playing]

912
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:30,955
[Neuman] Okay.

913
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,004
Hey.

914
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,048
- How transmissible is that?
- [Sameer] Not very.

915
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:44,427
Only through bodily fluid.
Blood, saliva... semen.

916
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:47,138
Okay, so we inject it into your dead buddy
over here as bait,

917
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:50,141
and then we put him outside to infect
the crazy fucking flying sheep.

918
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:54,771
This man is in no condition
to fuck a sheep.

919
00:46:57,106 --> 00:47:00,401
They would eat him.

920
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:02,487
- Oh.
- [Butcher] Bollocks.

921
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,865
That's the only dose.
I say we fucking leg it.

922
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,718
- Butcher's right, it's too valuable.
- [Annie] Okay, we run,

923
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,786
- we don't all make it.
- Darwinism, love.

924
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,372
Don't got to be the fastest,
just not the slowest.

925
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,748
No fucking way.

926
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,875
- Enough. Not now.
- I won't be able to outrun them.

927
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:18,002
[Butcher] Oh, don't you cry for that cunt.

928
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:19,796
He's just trying to nick Zoe from you.

929
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,190
That's his whole fucking plan, isn't it?

930
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:22,340
He's lying.

931
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,301
- Sorry, Stanny. Just business.
- Guys, stop.

932
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:26,987
- Son of a bitch.
- I should've fucking known.

933
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,681
M.M. could die, okay? Or Frenchie.

934
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,892
I mean, you really don't care
who you just throw to the wolves?

935
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:34,495
- No, not really.
- [Annie] You're a monster,

936
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,313
- and I'm not letting you do this.
- [Butcher] Or what?

937
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:40,275
You gonna go stark raving
like you did with Firecracker?

938
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,278
I got the head popper
and you can't even get it up.

939
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,197
Enough. Enough! Look. Look.

940
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,533
Y'all see this?

941
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:49,617
Hives.

942
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:50,952
And I got them

943
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,871
because y'all motherfuckers
are driving me the fuck crazy.

944
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:55,456
Now, Annie,

945
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,209
you can't just go around
fucking everybody up.

946
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,877
And, Neuman, do you really

947
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:02,630
want to risk Zoe growing up
in a group home the way you did?

948
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:04,882
And you.

949
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,259
Look.

950
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:09,262
My little baby girl needs me,
